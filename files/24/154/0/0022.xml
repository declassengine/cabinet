FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.The Herat Border [F.C.R., xxi, p. 2-]. On 1.5th July the Viceroy of India reported [No. 202] the arrival at Herat on 30th June of a party of Russians from Kushk, with baggage which was believed to contain wireless plant. Telegraphing [No. 203] again on 22nd July the Viceroy reported that this party had gone on to Kabul.Further parties of Jamshidis had also.arrived at Herat, and it was estimated that some 9,000 families would ultimately be collected there for deportation to Kabul and Kandahar. The Bolshevik Commander at Kushk was performing the duties of frontier officer, and had agreed to do his best to control the Jamshidis on the Badghis side of the border.ABABIA.King Hussein and Ibn Saud. LOn 14th July Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 710] saying that the chances of a peaceful pilgrimage to a considerable extent depended on the ability of King Hussein to buy off the Bedouins, over whom he had but little control, and this he could not do&apos; if his subsidy were not paid. He had just asked for an advance of 30,000Z., saying that his situation was very serious; Lord Allenby thought that the advance should be granted under certain conditions.In reply to this, on 17th July Lord Curzon authorized [No. 654] Lord Allenby to provide the King of Hejaz with money not exceeding 30,O00Z. in amount. Should Lord Allenby feel sure that King Hussein would be able to control his followers, it might be suggested to Ibn Saud that the arms of the Nejd pilgrims might be left at Taif, a course for which Lord Allenby [No. 710] understood there was a precedent. Lord Allenby was also instructed that he might inform King Hussein that our offer to arbitrate was still open.On 26th July Lord Allenby reported [No. 760] with reference to this telegram from Lord Curzon, that King Hussein had signified that, as we wished it, the roads should be open to the Nejd pilgrims ; he adhered to his opinion that their coming by land might provoke trouble, but he could not prevent anyone making the pilgrimage. His message was moderate in tone ; he merely stated that his - remaining on the throne rested with us, and did not repeat his threat to fly to Jeddah. Lord Allenby also said that he was sending 30,000Z. to Jeddah with instructions to Major Marshall to impress on King Hussein the necessity for the Nejd pilgrims being given facilities for the obtaining of supplies when they were at Mecca.Quarantine Officials at Jeddah [F.C.R., xxi, p. 4]. On 19th July Lord Curzon informed Lord Allenby that the inter-Departmental Committee adhered to their opinion that it was undesirable that the sanitary conditions in the Hejaz should remain as they were, but in view of the political situation they concurred that no attempt should be made to insist on British control of the quarantine. King Hussein might therefore be informed that we should not insist on this control. Lord Allenby had previously reported [No. 697] that King Hussein had no objection to Major Marshall making recommendations and submitting criticisms, and had at the same time expressed the opinion that it was desirable that he should remain during the pilgrimage. Lord Curzon approved this suggestion, saying that it would remove any objection to Major Marshall acting as British agent and would enable him to draw pay in that capacity.Lord Allenby replied on 21st July [No. 741] saying that on his return early in August, Major Batten would act as British agent. He hoped to be able to arrange for Major Marshall, who was paid by the Sudanese Government, to remain during the pilgrimage. King Hussein was not expecting a reply and he thought it better not to make any communication to him on the subject.
oKing Hussein and Syria. Ou 20tli July Lord Allenby transmitted [no number] -the following telegram which he had received from King Hussein: Syrians, your friends and supporters, whose action in cutting the communications .at Deraa and forcing the Turks to surrender to you was the least they did, do not deserve your silence and satisfaction in leaving them an easy prey to the French. This will make you in their eyes my (sic) partner in this great crime which history will not pardon.But if you submit the question to the Peace Conference and they do not see fit to solve it in such a manner (? as would preserve) the independence of (? the Arabs) -and give them the real benefits which (group undecypherabie) delegates pretend will be given, then the Peace Conference must either annex the Hejaz (which wishes only for union with Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine, either as ruler or ruled) or appoint a governor to come and take it over within the next three weeks.(? The ultimatum of) Gouraud to Feisal makes me feel that Great Britain has lowered my honour and dignity, and if this is so I cannot live or exist in the world.With great anxiety I await the answer of your Excellency, to whom I present my warmest respects.Assistance to Syrians. Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 759] on 26th July the information received by British and other agencies at Jeddah from King Hussein, that he feared that the A rah. people, influenced by their tribal and religious relations, might rise to assist the Syrians against the French. Should they do so, he disclaimed -any responsibility.ARGENTINA.Wheat Export Bill [F.C.R., xxi, p. 6]. Mr. Macleay telegraphed as follows on 20th July [No. 147] :-The French Government have agreed to sell 100,000 tons of wheat from their : stocks here to the Argentine Government at the price of 20 dollars (? per) kilo-gramme [sic].In exchange the Argentine Government have given the French Legation a definite guarantee that the balance of the 180,000 tons still unshipped will be allowed to leave the country (? despite) the recent decree limiting further export to 500,000 tons.In view of this guarantee which the Minister for Foreign Affairs originally refused to give either to my French colleague, my Italian colleague, or myself when we* proposed (? the cession of) our wheat, or later to me when I offered the 200,000 tons purchased by the Royal Wheat Commission at cost price, the arrangement appears favourable to the French, as I understand that the average cost of their purchases is less than 20 dollars.The French Charge d&apos;Affaires informed me that he had never received any instructions from his Government to protest to the Argentine Government against the effects of the law of 10th June imposing the surtax, though he had expected them.The Italian Minister did send in a written protest, but less strongly worded than my note.On 22nd July Mr. Macleay reported [No. 148] that on 20th July the President had sent a message, countersigned by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to the Senate withdrawing the Bill granting a loan to France, England arid Italy for the purchase of wheat and other products on the grounds that those countries had definitely abandoned the proposal originally made by them ; and that the message, which was querulous in tone, reproached the Senate for the delay in voting the measure, which was said to have caused the abandonment of the scheme, and asserted that amongst other serious moral and material losses sustained by the country on account of the failure of the loan project was the practical impossibility of finding a market for the Argentine wool clip.Mr. Macleay added that the statement was only true as regarded the attitude of the British Government.AUSTRIA.Non-fulfilment of Treaty Glauses. In a telegram [No. 2] from Vienna, dated --6th July, Admiral Troubridge called the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to-the infraction of Article 284 of the Treaty of Peace, by which Dantzic&apos; traffic has been
dislocated, and pecuniary loss caused to shipping companies.   By order of the Trades-Union Council of Amsterdam, all merchandise in transit from Germany to Hungary has been held up for five weeks.at Vienna and Lissz.   The Austrian Government declines responsibility, on the ground that they are rendered powerless to fulfil their-treaty obligation by the local solidarity of the Austrian Labour Party with Amsterdam.Settlement of Frontiers. Telegraphing [No. 330] from Vienna on 26th July, Mr. Lindley reported as follows : The Austrian Government addressed a note to the following effect to the Serb-Croat-Slovene representative there on 23rd July : Desiring to&quot;execute the treaty of St. Germain as soon as possible, and finding -itself obliged, in view of internal legislation regarding the question of nationality and taxation, to fix the extent of its territory with the least possible delay, the Austrian Government has the honour to inform the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government that it-intends to occupy with its civil and military organs, on-29th July, the region of Eadkersburg, Spielfeld, and the environs to the west of it, which having devolved to Austria through the peace treaty, have never ceased to belong to her juridically: By acting thus, Austria follows the procedure adopted by the Czecho-Slovak &quot;Government with regard to Austrian territory attributed to the Czecho-Slovak. Republic by the treaty of peace. The Austrian Government requests the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government to take note of the foregoing declaration, of which it is at the same time informing the International Evacuation Delegation, and to notify it what plenipotentiaries will be appointed to hand over the territory in question.In communicating this note.to me the Secretary of State requested me to notify7 the proper authorities, with a view to avoiding bloodshed and any kind of conflict when the southern Styrian territory is occupied by. Austrian military forces.BALTIC STATES.Livonia and the Bolsheviks.- Telegraphing from Riga on 21st July [No. 252], Mr. Tallents reported that the Minister of Foreign Affairs had told him that he hoped for peace with the Bolsheviks early in August, They expected to receive some shipping; but anticipated that only so much of the evacuated machinery as belonged to Lettish citizens would be returned, a limitation which excluded many large Riga factories.BOLIVIA.Coup d&apos;Etat. Telegraphing from La Paz on 12th July [No. 39], Mr. 0&apos;Reilly reported that the military, in sympathy with the Republican Party, had carried out a coup dletat with great ease and no bloodshed. There were reports of similar movements having been successful in the other principal cities.The President of the Republic was at the United States Legation, and the chiefs of the Liberal Party were imprisoned, but the revolutionary committee had promised that they should be sent out of Bolivia in due course with all consideration.There had been no damage to foreign property, and the town was perfectly quiet,On the following day he further reported [No. 40] as follows : The President has resigned, and is leaving for Arica with the principal members of his Cabinet and (? party]. The provisional Government committee consists of Republicans.   A Constituent Assembly is promised.The causes of the revolution seem to be discontent at the high cost of living, the illness and weakness of the President, (? the arbitrary) conduct of elections, and discontent amongst the officers ; but it could hardly have been brought off without funds which the Republican Party themselves did not possess. Part of the army was-apparently bought and the remainder (? agitated) into participation. There are now rumours of a possible reaction.The Republicans probably have the majority of the electorate at present, such as it is, but are deficient in educated leaders and depend on the army and the rabble. They wiU be short of money, and their best man, Salamanca, is standing out. They are alive to the importance of good behaviour generally and towards foreign interests.The revolution has upset the American loan and (? interests) in general, and it is partly because he-does not expect or hope that the present regime will last that my
American colleague is active in protecting the members of the late Government, and preventing their being deported to Peru, where they might be mobbed. His other colleagues and I have co-operated in order to prevent any discreditable incident.The present regime disclaims any hostility to Chile ; but it is, of course, identified with the claim to Antofagasta instead of Tacua and Arica, and is therefore in sympathy with Peru.Telegraphing again on 20th July [No. 45] he said that the Government Committee had assured the Chilean Charge d&apos;Affaires that they had the friendliest intentions in regard to Chile, and that the Charge d&apos;Affaires had replied that his country had no aggressive intentions, any measures which had been taken being purely precautionary.On the same day Mr. Vaughan reported [No. 117] from Santiago that he had been assured by the Chilean Government that they must be prepared for eventualities though they harboured no warlike designs.THE CAUCASUS.Treatment of British Prisoners. On 26th July, Mr. Grant Watson telegraphed [No. 650] as follows : M. Litvinoff states he is informed by the Azerbaijan Government that members of the British Mission in Baku are treated most humanely. Previous reports received by His Majesty&apos;s Government about the ill-treatment of British in Russia have proved to be inaccurate, which now, he continues, seems the case concerning the prisoners in Baku. Equally inaccurate is the information in possession of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment about the mutual relations between the Government of the Azerbaijan independent Republic and the commander of the Russian troops.M. Litvinoff protests in his Governments name against the decision to suspend the ^repatriation of Russian prisoners. The Russian Government have practically carried out the agreement, except for a few men left in Siberia, whilst His Majesty&apos;s Government have failed to take any steps for the repatriation of many hundreds of Russians in their hands. The Russian Government are most anxious, he states, that the agreement should be fulfilled in its entirety as soon as possible without any misunderstandings, and with this object in view he suggests that His Majesty&apos;s Government should appoint a day on which a complete exchange could take place, on the Finnish or the Esthonian frontier, of all Russians in the British Empire against British subjects left in Russia,The Russian Government wordd be prepared to use their influence to induce the Azerbaijan Government to bring to the frontier, on the appointed day, all British subjects detained in Baku.The following Avireless message was sent from Copenhagen, on 27th July, to M. Chicherin by M. Litvinoff : I am giving the substance of the note from A^elpra (? the British Government). There are still eight officers and seven men as well as civilians in Siberia, of whose repatriation Velpra have no news. As regards British subjects imprisoned in Baku, one of whom, the Vice-Consul Hewelcke, is in danger of his life, Velpra cannot accept the excuse that they are not being improperly treated, having full information as to the cruel conditions of their confinement. Neither can Velpra accept the plea that the Russian Government have no control over the actions of the republic of Azerbaijan, since all information in possesion of Velpra shows that all power there is in the hands of the Commander of the 11th Army, subject to the control of the Moscow Soviet, which is represented by a Commission. Under these circumstanstances Velpra have been compelled to order the custody of the six Russian prisoners who have just arrived in the United Kingdom from India, some of whom came originally from Baku. These will not be released until the British prisoners at Baku have been returned. Meantime all arrangements&apos; for the repatriation of other-Russian prisoners in British hands continue to be suspended. To this I replied that the information in possession of Velpra regarding treatment of British subjects and regarding our relatious with Azerbaijan is faulty, as was proved on other occasions. I protested against the imprisonment of Russians and the suspension of repatriation and suggested the appointment of a date for the exchange -on the Russian frontier of the remainder of the British and Russians, promising the use of our influence for obtaining the release of Britishers in Azerbaijan for that date. Klishko informs me that Velpra promised the release of Babushkin and Bolzeageres.18 i B
even Danzig, the only route now available being a most tortuous one through the Balkans, the Soviet Government is in fact not so boycotted, and can secure delivery of German material.Polish Peace Intentions. Sir Horace&apos;-Rumbold telegraphed-[No.-732] on -20th August the substance of a conversation he had had withi the Minister for Foreign Affairs that afternoon. &apos; -The latter said that he would contintie the negotiations at Minsk because the Polish Government were most anxious for peace. The greatly improved military situation would not affect their peace terms. II the negotiations at Minsk fell through, the Polish Government would propose some other meeting place. Meanwhile, they would pursue their military operations and would not take any previously proposed armistice line into account.The Poles felt that they must rely on their own resources to bring, their conflict with Soviet Russia to an end, because, for reasons which he quite understood, they have not been able to receive help in men or equipment from the Allies since they appealed to the latter at Spa. .  .&apos;Sir Horace asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he was not afraid that now that the Polish Army was successfully pushing back the Bolsheviks, the Polish military party might not again get the upper hand, and wish to go too far. He replied that the military party was not as anxious for peace as the Polish Government, but that the latter would be able to dominate that party. There were also most vital material considerations necessitating an immediate peace. The chief of these was the intolerable financial drain on Poland.&apos; Then, again, the Poles were short of 300,000 pairs of boots, and could not arm some 80,000 recruits and volunteers. He thought disarmament proposals would he dropped hy the Bolsheviks. He would try.for an honourable peace, and the Polish delegation would ask the Bolsheviks to indicate the points where they proposed to give the Poles a better frontier than the Conference line.Treatment of Prisoners. The following message from Lord D&apos;Abernon was telegraphed [No. 742] hy Sir Horace Rumbold to Lord Curzon on 23rd August :-The latest estimate of captures is as follows: 63,000 prisoners, 200 guns, 1,000 machine guns, not much ammunition, but large quantities of paper money-, which has, as your Lordship is aware, a very uncertain and fluctuating value. The Polish Government is becoming seriously embarrassed by7, the task of feeding so many prisoners, and may apply soon to the Red Cross or some other philan-thropic organization for assistance. I have made a special point of seeing.how the prisoners are treated.&apos; So far as I can ascertain the answer is completely satisfactory; there is not much rancour against the soldiers, who are regarded rather as victims of circumstance than as hated enemies. Those I have seen have been well fed and healthy ; most of them seem rather glad to be prisoners rather than in the fighting line with Jewish commissaires and Chinese behind.The Bolsheviks&apos; Situation. A later message [No. 745] on the same date trans-mitted the following information, which had been obtained from intelligent prisoners of the 16th Soviet Division who had served in the old Russian Army :-1. Bolshevik debacle is complete. They7 had intended to rally at Niemen,; but, owing to complete loss of moral, now intend to stand at Smorgon-Baranowicze, the old German line.2. Few.Soviet reserves are available, and these will have to come from Smolensk.3. Minor revolutions have taken place in various towns in Prussia.4. If retreat becomes impossible through Poland, the remnants of the army will pass through Lithuania.5. It was common talk in the army that the Minsk Conference was not serious, but had only been arranged to pacify the Entente, and to impress political parties in England with the Bolsheviks&apos; good intentions.The whole of the army understood that no peace was intended before Warsaw was captured.RUMANIA. - -Treaty with Bulgaria. Telegraphing [No. 370] from Bucharest on 11th August, Mr. Rattigan announced that the treaty7 with Bulgaria had been ratified the previous night by the Chamber by 114 votes to 3. : - ,   ,..,v.- .-.19-4 C
In reply to the communication contained in Mr. Grant WatsonV, telegram [No. 050], Lord Curzon sent the following telegram [No. 392] on 27th July : - Please inform M. Litvinoff that our latest information is that British prisoners at Baku are receiving most inhumane treatment.&quot;We are, however, prepared, as indeed we ahvays have been, to repatriate all Russian citizens in the Biltish Empire as soon as the Soviet Government repatriates all British subjects in Russia and at Baku. We, therefore, accept M. Litvinoff&apos;s proposal for the complete ex change of British and Russians at a date and jdace to be fixed later, and. will make arrangements to this effect as soon as we learn that the Soviet Government will secure the repatriation to this country of all British subjects whatsoever, without any exceptions, who wish to return including those detained at Baku.Until the belief, which is widely held and is greatly exciting British public opinion, that these prisoners are being inhumanly treated has been dissipated, it must be obvious to the Soviet Government that the pending negotiations must be futile.CHILE..   -Relations with Bolivia.- (See under &quot; Bolivia,&quot; p. 4.)Northern Question. On 20th July Mr. Vaughan reported [No. 117] that the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had expressed the opinion that, in consequence of the Bolivian coup oVetat, the moment had come for settling the Northern question once and for all. Telegraphing again two days&apos; later he said Chile wished to avoid the intervention of either the United States or the League of Nations which Peru and Bolivia were desirous of forcing.There was an impression that Chile would shortly either declare the annexation of the disputed provinces, or hold the plebiscite provided for in the treaty of Ancon. Her animosity was mainly directed against Peru.GERMANY.Russia, Poland and Germany. On 21 st July Lord Kilmarnock reported [No. 426] that Germany had declared her neutrality in the war between Soviet Russia and Poland, and that measures had been taken for the protection of her frontier.Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 431] Lord Kilmarnock said that the German Government wordd probably try to take advantage of the situation in Poland, deriving Avhat they could from it. The declaration of neutrality would enable them to put obstacles in the way of the delivery of German war material to Poland if the Allies intended the latter to have surrendered munitions.On 24th July he telegraphed. [No. 438] the following resume of an apparently inspired statement which had been published that day with regard to German neutrality : The attitude of the German Government will be regulated by the general principles of international law. , As neither Germany nor Russia is a member of the League of Nations, the stipulation of the Hague Agreement of 1907 with regard to the import and export of arms will apply, and this leaves each State free to forbid such traffic. The Treaty of Versailles does not oblige Germany to depart from neutrality. It abolishes the treaty of peace between Germany and Russia, but does not restore a state of war between them (Article 116)&apos;. The delivery to Poland of the arms surrendered by Germany cannot be demanded since it was expressly determined that such arms should be destroyed (Article 169). Transportation of troops through German territory is only allowed for the purpose of carrying out the Treaty of Versailles (Article 375), and can therefore not be undertaken in .order to support Poland against a State which is not a party to that treaty.Bolshevik Communique. On 23rd July Lord Kilmarnock reported [No. 433] that the Bolshevik representative in Berlin had issued the following communique : 1 wish to dissipate the widely-spread belief that we mean to march into East Prussia, or any part of Germany. Such is not our intention, and for two reasons. Firstly, such action would mean war with a country with which we earnestly wish to live in peace,
--and to take up industrial relations ; and secondly, a Russian advance into East Prussia would immediately provoke&quot; the strongest national reaction in Germany, and that is -obviously not our intention.HUNGARY.New Cabinet. On 20th July Mr. Athelstan Johnston reported [No. 422] that Count Teleki had formed a Cabinet which had been approved by the Governor. The following were the principal appointments :  Minister of the Interior   -   Dr. Julius Ferdinand.Minister of War -   Colonel Sreter.Minister of Finance        -   Baron Koroyyi.Minister of Commerce     -   Rubinek,  who   remains   provisionally Minister ofAgriculture.Minister President . -   Count Teleki, who remains provisionally Minister forForeign Affairs.ITALY.Incidents between Italian and, Greek Troops in Asia Minor- On 22nd July Sir George Buchanan reported [No. 311] that, in reply to his representations, he had received a note from the Italian Government, stating that the recent incidents between the Italian -and the Greek troops in Asia Minor, had been the subject of friendly conversations between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and M. Venezelos, who had found means to-arrive at a satisfactory solution; and that a commission composed of Italian and Greek representatives had been appointed, and would meet at Ajassolucto encraire on the spot into the circumstances which gave rise to the incidents. The commission would report to their respective Governments, who would thus be able to settle the matter in common agreement.JAPAN.The Diet-Sir Charles Eliot reported from Tokio on 12th July [No. 265] that the Diet, had done no business during the previous week, its time having been occupied by the attacks of the Opposition. Though the sessions had been turbulent, the position of the Government did not appear to. be seriously shaken ; a vote of censure had been defeated by a large majority, and accusations of speculating in shares which were brought against the Ministers had led to no result. The violent discussion would probably continue, and there was little hope that there would be leisure for any legislation of importance. The Bill for enabling foreigners to hold land was likely to be crowded out.MEXICO.Relations with Great Britain.- -On 23rd July Lord Curzon telegraphed to Mr. Cummins [No. 66] as follows : Sehor Palavicini called here and produced his credentials. He apparently expected formal recognition as Mexican Minister. After careful consideration a letter had been sent to him of which the following is a brief summary:    -(1) His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to resume friendly relations at the-earliest possible moment. (2) The return of certain properties to their owners has been noted.   HisMaj esty &apos;s Government appreciate the fact that the Mexican Railway hasbeen returned, and hope for similar treatment of other properties. (3) The recent proceedings of the Mexican Government are noted with great satis-faction.   Recognition is not necessarily contingent on the satisfaction ofall the British claims. (4) Before taking any definite steps His Majesty s Government are disposed to await the result of the presidential elections, and feel confident that thenew President will be a distinguished man in whose work of reconstructionthey will be happy to co-operate.
s(5) For the present Senor Palavicinfs credentials are returned with the assurance^ that when he is again in a position to present them His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment will he glad to receive him as Mexican Minister. In the interim should the Mexican Government, desire to communicate with the Foreign Office on important matters and desire to profit by his services for this; purpose, we. should be happy to regard him as representing the interests of the Mexican Government in an unofficial capacity.Senor Palavicini has replied that he is leaving for Europe and that Senor Hrcpiida will act as unofficial Mexican representative.PERSIA.Envoy to Russia. Mr. Norman reported [No. 519] on 22nd July that the Persian-Ambassador at Constantinople had been selected to go to Moscow as the Special Envoy of the Persian Government.   He had been instructed to insist on abstention by the Soviet Government from all interference in Persian affairs, from any form of support to Persian  revolutionaries, and from any kind of propaganda.   On these-demands being granted, the Envoy had been instructed to inform the Soviet Govern-ment that the Persian Government would be prepared to conclude a treaty of friendship with them.   Mr. Norman had objected to these instructions as implying-a political recognition of the Soviet Government, which had not yet been accorded by His Majesty&apos;s Government.   A modification of the instructions will therefore be made,, by which the proposal to the Soviet Government will be reduced to that of the establishment of commercial relations on a solid basis, and the negotiation of a postal and telegraphic convention.   Certain rectifications of the frontier and better terms for Mussulmans in the Caucasus will also be demanded.   Mr. Norman describes this as an ambitious programme, which he thinks unlikely to be carried out without British, support.   This has not yet been asked for by the Persian Government.POLAND.Poland and the Soviet Government. On 20th July Lord C-urzon informed Lord Derby [No. 802] that the British Cabinet had that day been considering the reply of the Russian Soviet to the proposals, for an. armistice with Poland which had been, concerted at Spa, and that the following action had been taken :  (1) The Polish Government had been asked to fulfil its undertaking to approach the Soviet Government with a view to an armistice.(&apos;2) A reply had been sent to the Soviet Government which avoided controversial issues; notified them that the Polish Government had been urged to initiate negotiations for an armistice ; did not insist on the proposed . Conference in London ;   and warned them, that if the Soviet   armiescontinued to advance, the British Government and its AUies would give the Poles the promised support.(3) Kamaneff and Krassin, who were at Reval en route to Great Britain, with a view to the resumption of trading relations, had been advised that it was useless to resume trading negotiations if Russia invaded Poland, and that they had better remain at Reval until an armistice was agreed to. [But see u Russia &quot; p. 9.]The Cabinet had also decided to send to Poland the mission which the Prime Minister and M. Millerand agreed to at Spa, Lord D&apos;Abernon had been selected as the British Envoy, and he wordd be accompanied by General Radcliffe and Sir-Maurice Hankey.Russo-Polish Armistice. On 23rd July Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 557] the following text of a note, signed by Prince Sapieha, sent by the Polish Government to the Soviet Government : The Polish Government have taken note of the fact that the Soviet Government in its answer to the note of the British Government of 11th July stated that it would willingly accept peace proposals, provided they were sent direct from the Polish Govern-ment. The Polish Government, desirous of putting an end to further bloodshed and hostilities, proposes peace to the Soviet Government, the immediate cessation of hostilities, and the opening up of: peace negotiations.   The proposal regarding the^
armistice is being sent simultaneously by tbe High Command of the Polish army to the High Command of the Soviet army.The following is the translation of a wireless message as intercepted : Moscow, 25th July. On 23rd July the Soviet Government received from Poland a direct demand for an armistice and peace, proposing tbe date of 30th July for the beginning of negotiations. Both the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and the Supreme Command of the Red Army answered at once, accepting, and added that the date of the first interview should be communicated by wireless. On 24th July the Front Command answered that, seeing that the front was rapidly moving .and communications with advanced posts were difficult, several days must be given to allow of the necessary measures being taken for the reception of enemy parj.ementa.ires. The date of 30th July proposed by Poland has been accepted, and on that day the Polish parlementaires will be received.   The interview will take place in Baranovitchi.In reporting [No. 583] the receipt of the above message hy the Polish Govern-ment, Sir Horace Rumbold announced on 26th July that meanwhile the Bolsheviks had taken Brody, thereby turning the Serucz line. In his opinion it was pretty clear that they would try to capture Lemberg before the conclusion of the armistice.Relations with Lithuania. On 20th July Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 543] that he had sent the following telegram to Kovno : The Polish Government informs me that the Lithuanians have disarmed four battalions of Polish troops and four batteries of artillery in the neighbourhood of the demarcation line, and they ask for our intervention with the Lithuanian Government with a view to the return of the men with their equipment and material if possible.They appear to be very good troops, and in the present crisis I should be grateful for anything you can do to secure compliance with the Polish request.RUMANIA.The Wagon Control Committee for Central Europe. Telegraphing from Vienna on 16th July [No. 314] Mr. Lindley reported that M. Leverve, President of the Wagon Control Committee for Central Europe, had made a communication to him to the following effect : I suggested to the Governments of Central Europe hy letter on 20th March and 15th June that a conference of state and private railway specialists should assemble at Vienna on 8th July to draw rip provisional regulations for the exchange of wagons. All the delegates, about 50 in number, arrived at Vienna and began work on 8th July with the exception of the Rumanian representatives, of whom we have no news, although the Rumanian Government had agreed in principle to the conference in a letter dated 9th May, addressed to the French Minister at Bucharest. In the absence of the Rumanian delegates the conference had to suspend its sittings until 15th July; it has decided to meet again on 3rd August in the hope that the Rumanian delegates will have arrived by that date.If the work is to be continued it is indispensable that Rumania should, participate, or else that it should be definitely known that the Rumanian Government does not wish to be identified with the railway agreements to he made between the States of Central Europe, or indeed with any negotiations on this subject. This last hypothesis would be obviously unfortunate from every point of view. I have requested the French Minister at Bucharest to make fresh strong representations to the Rumanian Government urging that delegates may be sent to Vienna before 3rd - August and asking for a definite reply immediately.1 shall be much obliged if you would be so good as to support this action.RUSSIA.Conference in London.-On 24th July Mr. Leslie tePegraphed from Reval [No. 170] transmitting the following message from M. Chicherin : The Russian Government expresses its willingness to meet the desire of the British Government as to its proposal to convene a confeience with the purpose o  18-4 C
establishing a definite agreement between Russia and the other Powers which participate in hostile actions against her or support such, and is of the opinion that the said conference ought to be composed of representatives, of Russia and. of the leading Powers of the Entente. The Russian Soviet Government agree that this conference should be called together in London. It makes known at the same time to the British Government that orders had been given to the military command to meet the Polish parlementaires and to,begin pourparlers relative, to an armistice and peace. The Russian Soviet Government cannot refrain from expressing its astonish-ment at the demand of the British Government to suspend the trade negotiations after the adoption by the Soviet Government of all its proposals which were the conditions for the opening of these negotiations, seeing that none of the said proposals has been violated by the Soviet Government.- The iatter thinks that the establishment of a durable peace and friendly relations will be extremely difficult if agreements once adopted are violated on the following ckry or left unheeded, or if conditions already accepted are, after the adoption of an agreemeat, supplemented by new and un-expected conditions not stipulated before. The Soviet Government expresses the hope that the British Government will henceforth adhere immutably to the principles laid down in the British memorandum of 1st July, and in the reply of the SoAdet Government of 7th July, and will in future abstain from any violations of this agreement or from adding to the latter new conditions not provided for therein. The Russian Government on its part, strictly adhering to its declarations as laid down in its note of 17th July, expects that before the beginning of the aboAre conference, the surrender of ex-General Wrangel and of his military forces will be carried through on the condition of securing personal safety to him, his adherents, and the fugitives under his protection, and of the transfer to the Soviet Power of all the Avar material, stores, means of communi-cations, and vessels, now in his hands.The following telegram [No. 209] Avas sent on 26th J uly to the British Consul at Reval for communication to M. Chicherin : -The British Government is glad to learn that the Soviet Government has authorized, the Military Command of the Soviet armies to negotiate an immediate armistice with the Polish Military Command, and that they are prepared to agree to a conference meeting in London, for the purpose of establishing a definite agreement between Russia and the Powers which were engaging in hostile actions against her or supporting such action. They note that the Soviet Government further propose that the representatives of the leading Powers of the Entente should attend this conference, and they are communicating with their Allies on this subject. Meanwhile- they would suggest that Messrs. Kameneff, Krassin and Miliutin should be authorized by the Soviet Government not merely to conclude the trade agreement between Russia and the-Allied&apos;Governments, but also to discuss preliminary arrangements for the proposed Peace Conference, because communications by cable will involve delay and possible misunderstanding. In reply to the latter part of the telegram the British GoArernment would point out that no trade agreement, even if completed, could haA*e produced practical results if Soviet Russia had refused an armistice and invaded Poland, and had thus forced Great Britain and her Allies to give active support to the Polish people in defending their liberties and independence. They therefore thought it best to stop Messrs. Kameneff, Krassin and Miliutin from making a journey which would be fruitless if no armistice were arranged. In view, however, of the present reply, they have instructed the destroyer to bring Messrs. Kameneff, Krassin and Miliutin to England immediately, or, if they prefer another route, the British Government w i II. ask the Governments concerned to facilitate their journey. As regards General Wrangel, the British Government must declare that General Wrangel is not, as the Soviet Government have suggested, their agent, or in any way. under their control. Nor have they had any responsibility for the recent offensive : while the suggestion that the British Government haAre any such designs with regard to the Crimea, as the SoAuet autho-rities appear to imagine, is absurd. They have, however, communicated to General Wrano-el the terms of the Russian Governments declaration.British Subjects in Russia. On 17th July Lord Curzon sent the following message [No. 193] to Mr. Leslie at ReA^al for transmission to M. Chicherin : In view of the acceptance by the Soviet Government of the principles laid down by the British Government as the basis.for the resumption of trade between Russia and Great Britain, the British Government are desirous of obtaining information regarding the repatriation of the remaining British subjects in Russia.
As the Soviet Government are already aware, a ship has been placed at the disposal of the Belgian Government for the transportation of Russians in Belgium, and is now on its way to a Baltic port.The British Government have received an unofficial report to the effect that Lieutenant-Colonel Johnston and five others are shortly expected to reach Reval, and, in requesting confirmation of this, would point out that in view of the imminent&quot; repatriation of Belgian subjects from Russia a most suitable opportunity is offered for repatriating at the same time the British subjects whose return is eagerly awaited.This applies more especially to Nora Macpherson, James Maxwell, Annie Maxwell, George Gibson, Albert Dick, Annie Wardroper, Alice Murphy, John Atkins, Jobling, Mary Winter, Mrs. Kennedy, and Professor Wilson, at Moscow, Petrograd and Vologda. It is understood that they have been imprisoned on various charges, the exact nature of which has never been communicated to us.The British Government expects to be informed shortly that the British prisoners of war captured in Siberia will be released forthwith, and that the Soviet Government have sent instructions to Baku for the repatriation of all British subjects now detained in that city.On 28th July Mr. Leslie transmitted the following message from M. Chicherin for Lord Curzon : Acknowledging the receipt of your telegram in which the British Government at least safeguards Nuertewa to reach Russia safely after his unwarranted arrest by British authorities, we hereby declare that provided the same applies to Babushkin and his associates no reprisals will be taken on British prisoners, and that pending your reply we have not resorted to any reprisal. We offer once more to pave the way for negotiations between the British Government and the Azerbaijan Government as to British prisoners in the Russian Governments power ; the principles laid down in the respective declarations of 1st and 7 sit July will be carried out in full in our further negotiations on this subject.[See under &quot; Caucasus,&quot; p. 5.]SERBIA.Resignation of M. Vesnich. On 20th July Sir Alban Young reported from Belgrade [No. 210] that M. Vesnich had resigned, ostensibly on account of the democratic side&apos;of the coalition not having supported him in the Chamber in regard to a clause in the electoral law connected with the right of teachers to sit as deputies.In reality the members of the coalition. Cabinet had failed to compose their differences in regard to the question of the party composition of Local Governments, and in regard to the system of exportation (sic ? supervision) and other internal affairs.It was said that M. Vesnich would continue to hold office until M. Pasich had arrived and tried to form a new administration.Telegraphing again on 27th July [No. 219] he said that M. Vesnich had been charged by the Crown Prince to re-constitute his administration, and was still occupied in endeavouring to reconcile the divergence of views prevailing amongst the different parties as regards agglomeration of points of importance, and it might be a considerable time before a new Cabinet was formed. It was not at all certain whether a new Coalition Cabinet was a practical possibility.SYRIA.Appeal for British Intervention. On 15th July Lord Allenby reported [No. 711] the receipt of a letter from Emir Feisal asking that we should intervene between him and the French; and on the following day [No. 716] he further reported that he had. received another communication from the Emir enquiring as to our attitude.On the latter date, 16th July, Lord Curzon replied [No. 653] saying that it would be neither expedient nor just for us to contest the right which the French had acquired by the grant of the mandate at San Remo. The responsibility would be exclusively theirs if their conduct in regard to Feisal landed . them in future troubles.18-4D
The French Ultimatum.  On 18th. July Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 730] the following translation of the French ultimatum to the Arab Government:  1. Absolute, disposal of the railway line from Rayah to Aleppo for all transport ordered by the French authorities.    -This will, be guaranteed by the entire control of the traffic enforced in the stations&apos; of Rayah, Baalbec, Horns, Hama, and Aleppo by the French mifitarv commissioners, supported by an armed detachment destined to ensure the policino- of stations; and by the occupation of Aleppo town, an important centre of eom-munications which we cannot allow to fall into the hands of Turkish troops.. 2, Abolition of conscription ; recruiting to cease (? forthwith) and contingents to be released ; the Sherifian army to return to the formations and effectives it possessed.&quot; on 1st December last.3. (?&quot; Acceptance of) the French mandate. The mandate will rfespect the-independent (? peoples; of Syria and will remain wholly compatible with the principle of government by Syrian authorities properly invested with power by the popular will. It will only entail on the part of the mandatory power co-operation in the form of collaboration and assistance, but it will in no case assume the colonial form of annexation or direct administration.4. Acceptance of Syrian money this money becoming the national monev of the eastern zone ; and all measures hitherto applied therein against theBanque de Syrie to be removed. .5. Punishment of those most deeply implicated in acts of hostility against France.These conditions are presented en bloc and they must be accepted en bloc within the period of the four days--midnight 1.4th July-I5th July to midnight 18th July-19th July.Should I, before the latter date, learn from your Royal Highness that these conditions are accepted, your orders must at the same time be conveyed to the local authorities in Order that no opposition be offered to my troops proceeding to occupy&apos; the positions indicated. Acceptance of conditions 2, 3, 4, and 5, must, moreover, be made effective by official action before 18th July, and their execution enforced before midnight of 31st July.If, on the other hand, your Royal Highness does not inform me within the . prescribed period that the above-mentioned conditions are accepted, I have the honour to inform you that the French Government will reassume full liberty of action.I can give no assurance that in that case the French Government would be satisfied with the moderate guarantees above indicated.It would not be France who would bear the responsibility for the troubles which might befall the country. France (group undecypherabie) (? given) evidence of her moderation in this last circumstance as throughout. Upon the Government of Damascus would fall the full weight of responsibility for the extreme solution which I cannot envisage without regret, but for which I am most firmly and most resolutely prepared.Protests against the Fr.ench March on Damascus. On 23rd July Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 748] the following message from Emir Feisal communicated through the Political Officer at Haifa : Referring to my last telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Government, I hasten to inform your Excellency that the Syrian nation, whose anger and patriotism have been excited by the action of. the French army in breaking its treaties before even the ink was dry on them and in now marching on Damascus in the guise of an enemy seeking revenge, is rushing from all quarters without order or discipline to meat the French at the gates of Damascus. Naturally there will be anarchy without limit, which I shall be powerless to prevent. The responsibility which the French nation is seeking, without any reason now that I have accepted their mandate and demobilized my army, will fall, in the knowlege of the Allies and all the nations of the world, on the shoulders of the attacking army and its ieaders. I beseech you in the name of protection for oppressed nations,, for the sake of our neighbourhood, and in the name of our alliance to do your best with the Allied Governments in London and Paris to prevent this human butchery.I ask this from your Excellency, in spite of the. fact that your Ministry have told its to communicate direct with France, because of the gravity of the situation and the shortness of the time; and you are the nearest means of transmitting communications to a higher authority.
TURKEY.Treaty of Peace to be Signed. On 23rd July Admiral de Robeck telegraphed [No. 845] the following summary of a note received from the Grand Vizier late on the evening of 22nd July : Hadi Pasha and Riza Tewfik Bey, Senators and ex-Ministers, and Reshad Haliss Bey, Turkish Minister at Berne, have been appointed to attend the Conference as Turkish delegates for the purpose of the signature of the treaty of peace. The two first named intended to leave by the Simplon express, but recent events in Thrace have prevented this. &apos; They will therefore leave via Constanza on 23rd July in a vessel placed at their disposal by the French. In case of their non-arrival in time, the Supreme Council is asked to excuse a delay due to force majeure. While the Turkish Government are (? resolved) to sign the treaty, they nevertheless wish to make a new appeal to the sentiments of justice and equity of the Entente Powers with a view to the following modifications and declaration being introduced : (1) The substitution of the Enos-Midia line which had previously been fixed asthe Turkish frontier for the Strandia-Chatalja line. (2j The exclusion (in case the frontier is so thrown back) of the shore of the sea of  Marmora from  the neutral zone and the limitation of latter  to(? the Straits).Next day Lord Allenby sent [No. 752] another message from the &quot;Emir Feisal also received through Haifa : In continuation of my previous message, I beg to inform your Excellency that (oroup undecypherable) given an explanation for his non-retirement in accordance with the first condition. General Gouraud now demands the acceptance of farther con-ditions which are absolutely impossible to grant. I am convinced he does not in the least desire any agreement between us, hut wishes to compromise my position further before an infuriated populace, who have already risen against me on account of my acceptance of his first conditions, and his final goal is -the possession of Damascus by cunning&apos; means unworthy of a civilized Government. He knows his conditions are impossible of execution, and will enter Damascus over the corpses of the masses that have gone out to meet him and drive him back, undisciplined, imperfectly armed, and without preparation, in order that black feet should not be permitted to profane the spot that has been the cradle of civilization. It will be this last sanguinary test that will finally show the civilized world that the Syrian nation definitely refuses the slavery of French rule. I (? thank) you for your honours (group undecypherable) to make your Government cognisant since my (group undecypherable) will ask the League of Nations and the Great Powers.Damascus taken by the French. Mr. Mackeretk telegraphed from Beirut on 24th July [No. 83] that the official commtmication stating that Damascus had been entered had been corrected, as it was premature. The main body of the French troops was then 25 miles from Damascus, at Jedede, and if the French were not attacked the advance would not continue. But telegraphing again [No. 84] two days later he reported that in consequence of an attack on the French garrison at Tell Kalah, Damascus had been occupied by French troops.Mr. Mackeretk followed this up by a further telegram [No. 85] on 27th July saying that the fighting had been serious, resulting in about 800 French casualties and about 2,000 Arab losses. The Emir Feisal had not taken part in the Arab resistance, which appeared to have lacked co-ordination, but Azmi Bey, the Minister of War, had been killed.Lord Allenby, telegraphing [No. 7G1] on 27th July, sent the following account which had been received by the French liaison officer at General Headquarters from General Gouraud himself :  The French column resumed its march on the morning of 24th instant. A serious engagement took place with the Sherifian troops, who were reinforced by bands of Bedouins supported by guns and machine guns. The enemy was put to flight and suffered enormous losses, and have left in our hands 9 cannons, 25 machine guns and large quantities of munitions of war, vehicles and stores. The Sherifian Minister of War was killed in battle.   French troops entered Damascus on 25th July.
(3) A special autonomous regime for Smyrna similar to that  of the free city of Hamburg.   &apos;(4) The Turkish Government is anxious to declare that the Caliphate being &quot; un point d&apos;union islamiqtie &quot; and consequently a religious question, can have no place in a political (? Treaty).The note asks me to communicate the above to my Government, and to use my influence to secure its favourable recexotion.The Grand Vizier hopes that, having regard to the enormous sacrifices accepted by Turkey, the Supreme Council will give her at least this satisfaction.
