FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Foreign Activities of the Amir. On 3rd October the Viceroy of India telegraphed [No. 1399 S] that it was reported that the Amir was negotiating with the local Chinese officials at Kashgar for the establishment of a Consulate in that place and that the matter had been referred to Peking ; it was also said that he had established one at Tashkend. The Viceroy recalled that information had been received last April that the Amir was then sending an ambassador to Persia, one having been already sent to Bokhara.Envoy to the Viceroy. On 6th October the Viceroy reported [No. 1407 S] that an Afghan Envoy had accompanied the British Agent at Kabul on his visit to India and that they had reached Peshawar. He was, he said, permitting the envoy to visit Simla because it was of immense importance that we should not lose touch with Afghanistan.The Bravin Mission. The Army Department of the Government of India reported [No. 13733] on 9th October that it had received reports from Peshawar to the effect that the Amir was still friendly with the Bravin Mission, though he had refused the suggestion to send anti-British agents to India which had been suggested by Bravin.   It was not thought locally that he would help the Mission.   .Nasrulla. In its telegram of 9th October, the Army Department also reported that the majority, including the military party and the leading mullahs, were inclined to support Nasrulla. The ill-feeling between Nasrulla&apos;s party and that of the Amir was becoming acute; Azizulla, Nasrulla&apos;s eldest son, and Inayatulla had been arrested.The afridi Deserters. On 9th October the Army Department also reported [No. 13733] that the Afridi deserters had been told by the Amir that he would do the best he could for them with the British Government. If they wished to enlist in the Afghan army they might, he said, do so.The Reported Advance to Kerki. On 14th October the Viceroy of India trans-mitted [No. 13932] a report he had received from General Malleson to the effect that an agent of the latter had just returned from Bokhara and that about 10th September he had heard that a few clays earlier a party of Afghans, some 400 in number, had arrived at Point Kerki by boat, having gone down the Oxus. They told the local Bokharans and Turcomans that they were merchants, and that they were armed because travelling was notoriously unsafe ; only five were, allowed to enter Kerki, the others being turned back. This, General Malleson suggested, might be the explana-tion of the reports of an Afghan advance to Kerki which were widespread.ARMENIA.Armenia and Azerbaijan. Telegraphing from Tiflis [No. 74] on 12th October, Mr. War drop reported that he had been notified by Captain Gra(? ce)li that Colonel Haskelhs proposed agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan had been signed, and that an American governor would be appointed for the neutral zone.Telegraphing again on the following clay [No. 75], he said that.this neutral zone would be in the Sharur, Nakhichevan, and Ordubad districts. He also reported that the Armenians were negotiating with Azerbaijan for a conference between them and the Georgians to settle all boundary questions.Armenia and Georgia. In his telegram of 12th October [No. 74] Mr. Wardrop also reported that he had been told by Mr. Ramishvili, (? Georgian) Minister for War, that a general agreement between Georgia and Armenia was on the point of being reached, and that the Georgian Government were willing to make sacrifices with that object despite the outcry in the Press.
The Armenians in Aleppo. On 7th October Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 1132] to Lord Derby, the Ambassador in Paris,, as follows: On the withdrawal of the British troops from Aleppo, His Majesty&apos;s Government will no longer be in a position to protector relieve the 6,000 Armenian refugees who are now in that town, and the British^ Military Authorities accordingly propose to transfer these refugees to Cilicia without delay. They are sending the whole equipment of the Port Said Armenian Refugee Camp, which is now practically cleared, to Cilicia. The equipment will provide for about 12,000. refugees.Your Lordship should therefore suggest to the French Government that it might also be advisable that similar steps should be taken with regard to the Armenians now collected in the districts of Urfah, Marash, Aintab, &amp;c. It is further proposed to arrange for the repatriation of 758 Armenians from Mesopotamia by sea to Cilicia.Please report as soon as possible whether the French Government approve of these steps, which appear to His Majesty&apos;s Government to be the most politic in view of the evident desirability of congregating the Armenians in certain districts rather than leaving them scattered.AUSTRIA.Ratification of the Peace Treaty. ReuteFs Vienna agent reported on 17th October that the National Assembly had adopted the Bill for the ratification of the Peace Treaty without a debate.   [The Times, 20th October 1919.]New Government. ReuteFs Vienna agent also reported that after the Chamber had adopted the ratification Bill Dr. Renner and the whole Cabinet tendered their resignation, which was accepted by the main committee, which proposed that the Assembly should re-elect Dr. Renner State Chancellor, and should accept his Cabinet list.   The Assembly then elected the new Government, which is as follows :  Dr. Renner       - Chancellor and Foreign Affairs.Herr Jodok Fink      - Vice-Chancellor.Herr Mathias Eldersoh -             - Interior and Education.Herr Hugo Ranek    - -          - Justice.Herr Julius Deutsch -             - War.Herr Richard Reisch -          - Finance.Herr Stockier    - -             - Agriculture and Forestry.Herr Zerdik -          - -          - Commerce, Industry, and Public Works.Herr Paul         - -              - Communications.Herr Hamusch - Special Administration.Herr Lowenfeld Russ -          - Food.Herr Michael Mayer -             - Constitutional Reform.Herr Ellenbogen      -,&apos; -          - Socialization Commission.In his inaugural speech Dr. Renner declared the new Government was based on an agreement between the two principal parties. It was a matter of compromise, he said, for the purpose of leading the State and the people out of a terrible crisis. The financial and economic restoration of the country occupied the central place in the Coalition programme, and the position was not hopeless. [The Times, 20th October 1919.]THE BALTIC STATES.German Ships. The Weekly Appreciation of Matters of Naval Interest for 11th October [No. 13] notes that one of His Majesty&apos;s ships reported on 10th October that she had to leave Riga town for the mouth of the river owing to heavy German fire. In consequence of this attack P.A.N.A.C. has informed Admiral Goethe that all free passages to German vessels in the Baltic are temporarily suspended. Ships now at sea in the Baltic are to be recalled and no others allowed to proceed. German vessels found at sea in the Baltic are liable to seizure b)* the Allies.The Foreign Missions. The Weekly Appreciation, &amp;c, for 11th October also notes that the military mission at Helsingfors has reported that in the event of the Baltic States not making peace with the Bolsheviks at the Conference on 25th October the result may be a revolution which would endanger all the Baltic Missions. The Allied Missions will, if necessary, be evacuated in His Majesty&apos;s ships to the mouth - of the Riga estuary.
The Estiionians and the Soviet. --Telegraphing- from Reval [No. 306] on loth October Mr. Bosanquet reported that the nearer a Russian settlement approached the more anxious did the Esthonians become in regard to their own future. In a conversation that day Mr. Piip had given him the impression that there existed a feeling that Esthonia had been abandoned by the Allies, and that she almost despaired of securing-a recognised status. Mr. Piip said that her attitude towards the Soviet peace proposals would be stiffened if England could help forward the question of recognition.    . .On 20th October Colonel Tallents reported [No. 69] that in view of the defeats of the Bolshevik forces Esthonia was taking&quot; no steps towards the proposed meeting,, but was waiting for developments.Poland and Latvia.. Telegraphing from Reval on 19th October [No. 66], Colonel Tallents reported that he had been officially informed that the Poles had promised to help Latvia if they were allowed to pass through Lithuania. So far nothing had resulted from the discussion of this point between the Lettish delegates and the Lithuanians.THE CAUCASUS.The &quot; Chorok:&apos;-Telegraphing from Tiflis on 8th October [No. 67], Mr. Wardrop reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that if the British Government would guarantee the safety of the Georgian coast against the attacks of General Denikin, the.Georgian Government would at once disarm the &quot; Chorok/&apos;Soviet Proclamation. On 9th October Mr. Wardrop reported [No. 70] that a long proclamation, signed by Chicherin and Narinan Narinanoff (head of the Near Eastern Mussulman section of the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs), had been addressed to the peasants and workmen of the Caucasus, who were told that General Denikin was coming to pat them once more under the yoke of Russia, and to restore autocracy, and that Soviet Russia hoped that they would not let their liberty be trampled under foot by this Tsarist general and English hangman. Mr. Wardrop noted the-interesting-fact that Chicherin had asked the trans-Caucasian Governments for their collaboration at the same time that he treated them as decidedly anti-Bolshevik.General Denikin and the Governments of Georgia and Azerbaijan. On 8th October Mr. Wardrop reported [No. 66, received 15th October] that he had received a memorandum from General Denikin&apos;s representative which ended by saying that General Baratoffs efforts to bring about friendly relations between the volunteer army on the one hand and Georgia and xAzerbaijan on the other, would be wrecked if there were any further interference by Georgia in the affairs of Daghestan, even in the form of protests to the Allied Powers.CHINA.Japanese Policy in China. Telegraphing from Tokyo on 8th October [no number], Mr. Alston reported that Baron Ilayashi, formerly Japanese Minister at Peking and now Governor-General at Kwantung, was there on leave. In a&quot;Press interview he had criticised Japanese policy in China during the last few years, and equally that of foreign Governments, for having clone no better. The best waj&apos;, he said, to stop foreign criticism was for Japan to stop doing improper things. As for reserving Manchuria and Mongolia for Japanese loans, what was the use of Japan obtaining concessions by means of an ultimatum and then neglecting to develop them ? The only way to bring about peace in China was, in his opinion, to give the Northern Government unqualified support; and before discussing loans to China it was necessary to win the hearts of the Chinese and of the Chinese Government. Tsingtau, he pointed out, was now so fully in Japanese hands that even if an international settlement were established, the quarters which were left were only fit for factories, &amp;c. He advocated better treatment for the Chinese in Tsingtau. than, they had received in Shanghai.FINLAND.Aland Islands [F.C.R, i, p. 5]. Telegraphing from Stockholm on 8th October [No. 1388], Mr. Ramsay reported that 60 prominent representatives of the Swedish element in Finland had addressed to the people in Sweden an appeal on the Aland
Islands question. The Swedish Finns began by declaring their loyalty to Sweden-The chief argument brought forward against the cession of the Aland islands was that if Finland were compelled to cede them no friendship between Sweden and Finland would be possible. &quot;Finland seemed now to be at the cross roads ; one road leading to the Scandinavian countries and the other to Germany.&quot; They said that the solution of the question would greatly affect the direction taken by Finland, since the natioual bitterness caused by loss of the islands would powerfully strengthen the forces making for Germany.The second argument was that the loss of the islands would have a detrimental effect on the position and influence of those of Swedish nationality in Finland.The appeal had been taken very seriously by the Swedish Press in general.Telegraphing from Helsingfors on 20th October [No. 569], Sir Coleridge Kennard reported that at a representative meeting held at Tammerfors on 19th October, at which delegates from all the provinces and the principal towns were present, the following resolutions were adopted : (1) As the Aland Islands geographically, historically, and constitutionally form an inseparable part of Finland, ihe meeting is of opinion that Finland cannot consent to a separation.(2) It is the duty of the Government to safeguard the integrity of Finland and to take all necessary steps against its violation.(-!) As Fiuland did not take part in the European war, the meeting is of opinion that the Aland Islands question does not fall within the scope of the Paris Conference.(1) The meeting shall address telegrams to the Governments of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Great Britain, France, Italy, United States, and Japan.(5) The meeting shall send a deputation to the Finnish Government and, if possible, to Paris.(6) As the population of the Aland Islands forms only a fractional part of the Swedish population of Finland, the Aland Islands cannot be separated from Finland on the ground of the principle of self-determination.The Soviet Peace Proposals. Telegraphing from Helsingfors &quot;on 17th October [Nos. 558.and 560], Sir Coleridge Kennard reported that the Diet had decided (after a motion to lay the matter before a Oommittee on Foreign Affairs had been rejected by 107 to 83) that the Governments communication on the subject of the Bolshevik peace proposals did not call for any action on the part of Parliament.In his speech on foreign affairs in the Diet the Prime Minister had stated that the attitude of the Finnish Government had always been that peace negotiations with the Soviet could not be entered upon except in case of necessity. This necessity might have arisen in connection with the desire of the border States for a speedy peace, and the war-weariness of Great Powers. Owing to FinlancPs participation at Dorpat, the opening of peace negotiations had been postponed. Meanwhile the situation had cleared ; there was now no possibility of peace negotiations. The interests of Finland demanded a negative attitude towards the Soviet.Sir Coleridge had already reported on 13th October [No. 514] that the Finnish Government would definitely refuse to enter into negotiations with the Soviet.The Social Democrats. On 20th October Sir Coleridge Kennard reported [No. 567], that the Social Democratic Communal Organization of Helsingfors, at a preparatory meeting for the party congress, passed a resolution, with only four dissentients, calling upon all the Workers&apos; Organizations throughout Finland to leave the second International. He had been informed that this cUd not necessarily imply support of the third International.FRANCE.Ratification of the Peace Treaty. Lord Derby reported on 13th October [No. 1092] that the Peace Treaty had that day been ratified by the President of the Republic.Representative on the Council of the League of Nations. Lord Derby reported on 14th October [No. 1097] that a decree appointing M. Leon Bourgeois French representative on the Council of the League of Nations had that day been signed by the&apos;President of the Republic.2-4 B
Bates of Elections. Lord Derby reported on 16th. October [No. 1100] that the Chamber had adopted the Government Bill fixing the date of the election of deputies for 16th November ; the new Chamber would meet on 8th December. The municipal elections would take place on 30th November; those of the Conseils Generaux and Conseils d&apos;Arrondissement on 14th December, and those for the Senate on 11th January.ITALY.Ratification of Peace Treaties. On 8th October Sir Rennell Rodd reported [No. 642] that it had been officially announced that the King of Italy had signed decrees approving the German and Austrian Peace Treaties of 28th June and 10th September. The decrees in question would be presented to Parliament for conversion into law.Fiume. The Admiralty &quot; AVeekby Appreciation &quot; for 14th October [No. 43] says that a report on the situation at Fiume, received from a reliable source, indicates that D&apos;Annunzio has been largely influenced in his adventure by his desire to overthrow Nitti, whom he hates bitterly, and even the cession of Fiume to Italy will not satisfy D&apos;Annunzio, who is bent on Nitti&apos;s downfall. The whole of the officers and men of the Army and Navy have freely expressed their intense sympathies with D&apos;Annunzio, and very large sums have been contributed by them towards his funds.A letter from Admiral Nunes quotes the following words of Admiral Cusani Visconti : &quot; During all the war the Italian Navy never fired a shot against Fiume. it will not do so now.&quot;PERSIA.Persia and Azerbaijan. Telegraphing from Teheran on 10th October [No. 676], Sir Percy Cox* reported that the Persian Government was in a difficult position in regard to that of Azerbaijan. Owing to their refusal to recognize the latter, rebellious Persian subjects such as the Jungalis were, it appeared, being more or less openly encouraged, whilst Persian subjects and interests were receiving short shrift at Baku and other places. The Persian Government, therefore, again sought advice as to the expediency of their receiving a representative of the Azerbaijan Government.Telegraphing again on 18th October [No, 689], Sir Percy said that he had received a visit from the Russian Charge d&apos;Affaires, who had heard of the possibilit3r of the Azerbaijan Government being recognized. He said that the reception of an agent of that Government at Teheran would make the position of his Legation extremely difficult, and he hoxDed that the British Government would adhere to the advice it had already given.POLAND.General Conditions. Telegraphing from Warsaw on 14th October [No. 325], Sir Horace Rumbold said that though there was much unrest amongst the unemployed town population, as, owing to the want of raw materials and coal, industries could not be started, and that the agricultural classes were dissatisfied as the land reform had not been initiated, still he did not regard the attitude of the. peasants and workmen as revolutionary, nor did he think that the Government would be overthrown. He thought that if, with the help of the Allies, the Polish Government found means to provide for the maintenance of the unemployed during the winter the country would remain quiet, more especially if an end should come to Bolshevism in Russia. The Bolshevik propaganda was very strong and so was the communist; and both were well organized. There was a strong Socialist propaganda against the war in the East, but a member of his staff had been assured by M. Moraczewski that the party was not Bolshevik. The moral of the army was less good than it used to be.Poland and Eastern Galicia. -The following document [G.T. 3308] was com-municated to the Prime Minister by Mr. Paderewski:  The Report of the Commission for Foreign Affairs, concerning the motion of John Dabski and other members of the P.S.L. &quot; Piast&quot; club in the matter of a &quot; provisional settlement &quot; for Eastern Galicia.The House is requested to vote.
The Diet states : Any provisional settlement in the legal relation of so-called Eastern Galicia to the Polish Republic, whilst creating an unavoidable soLirce of friction between Poland and the neighbouring States, and rendering most difficult the re-establishment of harmony and peaceful life between the nationalities inhabiting this country as well as its economic reconstruction, would render impossible -the fulfilment of the duties incumbent on Poland in the way of founding a durable peace in europe.The Diet requests the Government and the Polish Delegates to the Peace Conference in Paris to secure without delay the final reunion of eastern Galicia to the Polish Republic, in accordance with the decisions of the Diet of 23rd May 1919, assuring to the Ukrainian population complete equality of rights and extensive -autonomy, whilst finally opposing themselves to any provisional settlement in this matter.In regard to this question Lord Curzon telegraphed as follows [No. 1228] on 13th October to Sir Eyre Crowe in Paris :-We consider that under no circumstances should Eastern Galicia be annexed to Poland. Its population is two-thirds Ruthenian, and the questions of its relations with the Ukraine will inevitably become acute at some future date. It would be fatal if the League of Nations were committed to the permanent incorporation in Poland of this territory and a permanent separation of its people from their racial fellows, whatever their wishes may be and whatever guarantees of local autonomy might be given. The League of Nations must keep a perfectly free hand to deal with this question whenever they consider it necessary..... The best hope for a satisfactory and peaceful settlement would seem to be that Poland should be given a mandate, subject to the necessary provisions for local autonomy, such as those embodied in the draft Treaty, for a period of, say, ten years; at the end of which time the League of Nations should be called upon to decide whether the territory should be transferred to another State, should become inde-penclent, should be incorporated in Poland, or should remain for a further period in a temporary status. If the inhabitants know that at the end of ten years their case will be considered afresh after such tests of local opinion as the League of Nations thinks best, they are far more likely to accept Polish rule peacefully in the interim, and the Poles are far more likely to give education and good government in the hopes of persuading them that the best course is to remain with Poland.Poland and Lithuania. Telegraphing from Warsaw, on 15th Octobsr [No. 327], Sir Horace Rumbold reported that in the course of conversation the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs had said that the Polish Government admitted that an attempt had been made by a number of Lithuanian Poles to upset the Lithuanian Government, but this was because they suspected that Government of playing into the hands of the Germans. The Polish Government neither inspired the attempt nor backed it. The Acting Minister.also pointed out that the Polish Government had every intention of abiding by their formal assurance that they would not take advantage of Lithuania^ present difficulties, and they thought it very desirable that on their part the Lithuanian Government should modify their anti-Polish policy.General Strike in Warsaio. In a telegram despatched from Kovno on. 19th October [No. 3] Mr. Ward mentioned that a general strike had been declared in Warsaw.RUMANIA.The Neiu Ministry [F.C.R., i, p. 10]. Telegraphing from Bucharest on 30th September [No. 452, received 14th October] Mr. Rattigan reported that the new Ministry was composed as follows :  General Vaitoiano      -   President du  Conseil, Minister of  the Interior andtemporarily Minister of Foreign Affairs. General Lupeseo -   Minister of Public Instruction:General Popovici        -   Minister of Agriculture and Domains. General Popesco -   Minister   of   Industry   and   Commerce,   temporarilvMinister of Finance. General St. Mihail      -   Minister of Public Works. General Pashcano       -   Minister of War.&apos; Ministers without portfolio : Messieurs Incultz, Dr. Ciugureano, Dr. Nistor, Dr. Vaida Voivod, Goldish and Pop.
Rumania and Serbia.- On 12th October Mr. Rattigan reported [No. 463J as -follows : The Serbian. Charge cVAffaires informed me to-day that the Prime Minister-had sent for him on the 9th and had spoken very frankly. His Excellency had said that 1 had advised him very strongly to bury the hatchet with Serbia and start afresh. He was prepared to follow this advice provided that he had reason to believe-that the Serbs would meet him half-way. The Serbian Charge d&apos;Affaires at once informed his Government of my intervention and of its favourable reception by the Rumanian Prime Minister. As a result he received a telegram from Belgrade to the effect that all goods for Rumania, held up by the Serbs, would be forthwith handed over to a Rumanian or British delegate at the Rumanian frontier. Meanwhile, General Desperey had succeeded in carrying through the arrangement for the -withdrawal of troops from the Banat initiated by General Greenly.RUSSIA.Anti-Soviet Russia. Telegraphing from Warsaw [No. 316] on 11th October,. Sir H. Rumbolcl reports as follows : In an interview with a Russian correspondent Monsieur Koutepoff, Admiral Kolchak&apos;s Representative . at Warsaw, stated that Anti-Soviet Russia consisted at present of three parts : Siberia, South Russia and North-Western Russia. The object of General iudenich&apos;s offensive in the latter part was to take Petrograd. These territories were under Kolchak, Omsk being the seat of Government. Monsieur Sazonoff, from whom he had received credentials, was Foreign Minister, and there were two Vice Ministers :, Monsieur Soukine, attached to Kolchak, and Monsieur Nieratoff, attached to Denikin. He had received instructions to establish cordial relations with the Polish Government and was convinced that the relations would be based on common interests. He was awaiting with impatience the moment when the Polish Army would join up with Denikin&apos;s Army, and he was certain that the common enemy would unite the two armies. He thought that Moscow would be freed, from&apos; the Soviet Government in six to eight weeks and that regenerated Russia would quickly rebuild her State. Monsieur Koutepoff refused to make any statements regarding the Baltic States, as this was beyond his competence. He concluded by saying that the one object of all Russians was to free Moscow from Bolshevik rule.Position at Odessa. Mr. Lowdon reports [No. 9] on 15th October an- improved position at Odessa and the maintenance of comparatively good order. Foreign trade, however, is at a standstill, while the railway service is completely disorganized and the Black Sea steamship service is irregular and bad. The postal and telegraphic communication with the interior is also bad. Although banks are open they will not undertake business. British subjects are advised not to return unless certain of employment, and then it will be at their own risk as, owing to scarcity of fuel, Odessa will probably be without light or heat this winter.North-West Russia and Petrograd. On 15th October Mr. Bosanquet reports-[No. 305] that he has been informed by the Premier of the North-Western Government that the Government is organizing the reoccupied districts of Jamburg and Gdov. The Premier is of opinion that should Petrograd be taken, the stores of the American&apos; Food Commission at Viborg and others to be obtained from the same source from Copenhagen will enable it to be provisioned for one month in all.Colonel Tallents telegraphs [No. 67] on 19th October that the North-Western Government are apprehensive lest Vudenich on entering Petrograd should act on orders from Denikin, and establish a military dictatorship, and proceed to break the jdedges made to the Baltic States. They fear that if Yuclenich breaks his pledges and gives way to his reactionary surroundings, they will lose the sj-mpathies of all democratic States ; supplies of food and fuel required for Petrograd will be cut off by the Baltic States ; and that with a purely Military administration the interests of the- Petrograd population will be neglected, and a &quot;white terror&quot; ensue.British Prisoners in Bolshevik hands. The &quot; Weekly Appreciation &quot; for 4th October [No. 42] records that the Admiralty has been informed that it is reported that the British naval prisoners in Petrograd captured during the raid on Kronstadt are being treated with fair consideration. The &quot; White &quot; organization has agreed to send them j)arcels of provisions twice a week.Exchange of Prisoners. Mr. Ramsay telegraphs [No. 1407] from Stockholm on 17th October that a wireless telegram had been received from Mr. Chicherin at.
Moscow expressing his acceptance of the proposal that their delegate should meet our representative in Denmark in order to avoid further delays in the exchange of prisoners.Archangel. The Admiralty &quot;Weekly Appreciation&quot; for 14th October [No. 43] noted that all was quiet in Archangel.Murmansk. The &quot; Weekly Appreciation &quot; for 14th October also noted that the evacuation of Murmansk was completed on 12th October, and that the Murmansk Railway was reported intact.Goreans in North Russia.-&apos; he &quot; Weekly Appreciation&quot; for 14th October further noted that the Coreans in North Russia had been refused repatriation by the North-West Russian Government.The Omsk Government.New Paper Currency. Mr. OTieilly reports [No. 849] on 14th October the receipt from Omsk of a message giving the substance of a note handed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to Foreign Representatives in regard to the proposed issue of a new paper currency. It states that the objects in view are (1) a monetary system of National Russia separate from that of Soviet Russia, (2) .the unification of all money in circulation, and (3) an improvement in the quality of the paper so as to effect a guarantee against forgery. The issue is to commence in the Far East, where the financial system is held to be most disorganized, towards the middle of the present month. Great, importance is attached to this measure, the failure of which would cause discontent throughout the country?, and result in a political crisis, whereas its success would provide a basis for a future economic- and financial programme.Commission for the Zemstvo Conference. In a telegram [No. 852], dated 17th October, Mr. 0&apos;Reilly reports information from Omsk to the following effect. Five Ministers and five members of the Economic Conference are to compose the Corn-mission for working out the Constitution of the Zemstvo Conference. As at present proposed it will consist of some 260 members, of whom 80 will be elected from district Zemstvos, and&apos;it will be a permanent assembly, having functions similar to those of the Imperial Duma. It is expected that the law will be issued in about a fortnights time.Siberia.Seminoffs visit to the Railway Zone. On 9th October Mr. OTieilly telegraphed [no number] that he had received information from General Horvat that a detachment of Seminoffs Cossacks had arrived at Harbin, and that other detachments destined for places along the Chinese Eastern Railway were on their way. The detachment at Harbin&quot; was surrounded by Chinese troops, and General Horvat feared a conflict between the detachment and the Chinese together with his own Russian troops. The formal orders of the detachment wrere to proceed to Habarovsk, but it had secret instructions to detrain at Harbin with a view of advancing Seminoffs plan to.secure the military and administrative control over the whole of the Chinese Eastern Rail way.General Horvat also informed Mr. 0&apos;Reilly that the Japanese Consul-General had asked the Military Governor at Mukden that there should be no interference on the part of the Chinese in any action Seminoff might take along the railway.Mr. 0&apos;Reilly further telegraphed [No. 837] on 11th October that the Omsk Government was much perturbed by Seminoff&apos;s action, and that orders had been given for his immediate withdrawal. It was suggested that the Japanese might be behind his movement.A statement from Tokio reported by Mr. Butler on 11th October from Vladivostock [No. 840] is to the effect that Seminoffs visit to Mukden was merely to thank in person the Chinese Eastern Railway employees for their hearty reception of himself on his way to Vladivostock, with the object of strengthening the ties of friendship between Prussia and China.American^ Japanese Relations. Mr. Alston telegraphed [No. 403] from Tokio, on 9th October, that an assertion had appeared in the Japanese Press that the 2-4 C
friction existing in Siberia between American and Japanese troops guarding the railway was making further co-operation impossible, and that the withdrawal of the American troops was a necessary consequence. The Japanese Foreign Office publicly denied any knowledge of such an intention on the part of the United States, or of any friction in Siberia likely to have such a result. Mr. OTleilly, in reference to the above telegram, reported from Vladivostock [No. 843] on 14th October that the attitude of the local American representatives did not indicate any disposition to withdraw any American troops as long as any Japanese trcops remained in that country. Mr. OTieilly suggested the probability of a fresh American-Japanese crisis arising out of Seminoffs latest adventure.On 11th October Lord Grey reported [No. 1441] from Washington that the United States Government had received telegrams from Eastern Siberia to the effect that the Cossacks, instigated and supported by the Japanese, might attack American soldiers. The Government were apprehensive that Seminoff and others working with him under Japanese instigation might declare an independent State for Eastern Siberia, Mongolia, &amp;c, and would then object to the presence of Allied troops ; the State, however, would be really of Japanese creation and a part of Japanese policy. The United States Government considered the removal of American troops from Eastern Siberia undesirable as it would leave the Japanese in unchecked possession. Never-theless they were sending transports to Vladivostock to remove American troops in case they were forced out of the country.Enemy Prisoners in Siberia. Mr. 0&apos;Reilly was informed [No. 597] by the Foreign Office on 15th October of the decision of the Supreme Economic Council to form a Commission consisting of one military representative of each of the American, British, French, Italian and Japanese Governments. The Commission will undertake the repatriation of enemy prisoners in Siberia when the repatriation of Czecho-Slovak troops is completed.Turkestan.Anti-British Propaganda. On 1,5th October the Viceroy of India transmitted [No. 11016] an agent&apos;s report, in regard to Kazim Beg&apos;s propaganda, sent from Merv on 4th October to General Malleson. Kazim Beg proclaimed that Egypt had revolted against the British ; that Khalil Pasha was coming to Afghanistan to take command of the Mahommedan forces ; that Turkish troops would soon invade Persia they had already occupied Baku ; that a plot in Shiraz would shortly materialize ; that the Bolshevik Government had a secret alliance with Turkey; and that positive informa-tion that the British had blown up Mecca and Medina had been received by Barka-tulla. Those who questioned these statements were, the agent said, liable to punishment by the Bolsheviks.SERBIA.Ministerial Crisis. Telegraphing from Belgrade on 17th October [No. 349], Mr. Athelstan Johnson reported that the Prince Regent had given a mandate to form a new Government to M. Daviclovitch, recommending him to endeavour to form a Coalition Government. The following day he reported [No. 350] that the Ministerial crisis was over, and that the Davidovitch Cabinet remains in power. The only, change in its composition is that M. Bianchini, a Croatian deputy from Dalmatia, becomes Vice-president of Council without portfolio.Question of Fiume. Mr. Athelstan Johnson, in a message from Belgrade [No. 344] on the 14th October reports the views of M. Trumbitch that the minimum which would satisfy the S.H.S. nation would be the frontier line designated by President Wilson, with Fiume a free port under no Italian control Avhatever. Ail facilities for passenger and goods traffic from Fiume to Vienna and Budapest could be promised on behalf of S.H.S. Government,SWEDEN.Proposed Blockade of Russia. Telegraphing from Stockholm on 16th October [No. 1106], Mr. Ramsay reported that the Swedish Federation of Trade Unions had addressed a memorial to the Swedish Government requesting them to reject any - demands for Sweden&apos;s participation in a blockade of Russia.
The extreme Socialists had held a big meeting at which a resolution had been passed protesting against a blockade, and urging the Government and Parliament to repudiate demands incompatible with Sweden&apos;s independence and neutralitv as well as with the interests of workmen.Telegraphing again on 19th October [No. 1409], Mr. Ramsay reported that the French Minister had discussed with the Minister for Foreign Affairs allied action in regard to the blockade of Soviet Russia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was considerably embarrassed as the trade unions were opposed to a blockade and he stated that the Swedish Government were not able to control the bankers who appeared to have dealings with Soviet Russia.A public demonstration of protest had been announced for that clay.SYRIA.The Lebanon.   Telegraphing from Alexandria on 10th October [No. 470], Colonel Meinertzhagen said that armed&apos;conflicts would inevitably follow the with-drawal of British troops from the Lebanon, in consequence of the French policy of favouring the Maronites at the expense of the Druzes ; and the immediate effect of that conflict would be the adoption by the latter of an anti-French policy, either that of Emir Feisal or that of the Druzes of Gebel Druze.TURKEY.The Mustapha &apos; Ke.rn.al Movement. On 7th October Colonel Meinertzhagen, telegraphing from Cairo [No. 465], sent a report based on information, which, he said, had been collected from data which could be relied on. The movement, which is a national one, began with the Greek occupation of Smyrna, and has been strengthened by various subsequent events. It is now confined to a widespread political resistance to the Government with the support of the army, and unless further provoked it is unlikely that it will take the form of military activity. The success of the movement is largely due to the complete ignorance of the masses that Turkey sued for peace. Such a national movement could not be killed by repressive measures, they would only increase its vitality.Three days later, telegraphing from Constantinople [No. 1941], Admiral Webb reported that a telegram from Mustapha Kemal had been communicated to him and to his French colleague. In this Mustapha Kemal defined his relations with the new Government. He demanded the arrest and trial of certain members of the late Government and of certain governors, also immediate elections under the supervision of the Nationalist Party.The National Movement and the Christian Population. Telegraphing from Constantinople on 19th October [No. 1978] Admiral de Robeck reported that two days previously the High Commissions had been visited by the Armenian Patriarch and the acting Greek Patriarch, who called together for the purpose of impressing on them the dangerous situation which the triumph of the national movement would create for the Christian population. They urged that it might come about that they would have no alternative but to resign their functions, leaving the protection of their flocks to the Entente. The recent change of Government they regarded as nothing else than a return to power of the C.U.P.PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.The following reports have been received :&apos; Peace Conference.-^ .C.V. 1336.
