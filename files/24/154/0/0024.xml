FOREIGN  COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Internal Affairs. Telegraphing on 12th August the Viceroy reported that the Afghan attempts to collect revenue had occasioned tribal unrest and met with continued resistance in Khost. Several encounters between Khostwals and Mahsud Waziri immigrants were reported to have taken place.The Herat Border [F.C.R., xxiii, p. 2]. On the Herat frontier the Jamshidis were reported to have made a raid on a large scale in the Gulram district. The post at Kizil Bulak had been surrounded, and the neighbouring villages raided. The Jamshidi raiders had made off with considerable loot to Russian territory.ARABIA.King Hiissein&apos;s Subsidy. -Mr. Scott telegraphed [No. 834] from Alexandria on 16th August that if approval were given to the payment, of the subsidy to King Hussein, it was most desirable that it should be made at once. The King had taken up an obstinate attitude as he considered the recent French action in Syria and their occupation of Damascus to be not in accordance with the agreements under which he had joined the side of the Allies in the war. So long as payment of the 30,000Z,, now at Jeddah, was withheld, Mr. Scott thought it would be useless to approach the King. But payment of this subsidy might put him in a better frame of mind, and induce him to sign the treaty.In reply to the above Mr. Scott was informed [No. 746] on 20tb August that payment of the 30,000Z. to King Hussein was sanctioned on the conditions that :-(1) The treaty should be signed by the Hejaz ; (2) that the King should afford a civil reception to the Nejd deputation, who should be enabled to purchase their necessary supplies while at Mecca ; (3) that the money should be spent locally, and that Indian pilgrims on the Haj should be assured of freedom from trouble. In order to ensure these conditions being observed, it was suggested by the Treasury that the payment should be made, as to one-third, on the acceptance by the King of these conditions, and the remainder when Mr. Scott was assured that they were being satisfactorily complied with. Mr. Scott was invited to consult with Colonel Marshall as to the best method of attaining the desired result.ARGENTINA.Expropriation BUI [F.C.R., xxii, p. 3]. On 19th August Mr. Kelly sent the following telegram from Buenos Aires : The Bill for expropriation was passed by the Deputies yesterday, but I am assured that the Senate will throw it out as unconstitutional. The project is regarded as a political move by the Argentine Government to conciliate public opinion, which is highly excited by the cost of living, and to be able to state that the Senate has thrown out the Bill because the Senate has not the real interests of the populace at heart. The Committee, of whom Mr. Leng is chairman, have made a protest to the Parliamentary Committees, and are confident that everything is being done to protect sugar and other industries.ARMENIA.Agreement with Bolsheviks. From Constantinople the following report from Commander Luke at Tiflis, dated .11th August, was transmitted [No. 355] on 15th August: The Armenian Government have informed me that an agreement was concluded by them at Tiflis on 10th August with the Soviet representative Legrand, whereby as a preliminary to final peace negotiations to be continued in Erivan 
Armenia has agreed to the temporary occupation hy Bolshevik troops of Kartiaogh, Zangezour and all Nakhitchevan south of Shaitakhti. Legrand has communicated to the Armenian Government that Bolshevik troops have already advanced hy rail towards Tabriz, and that on 31st July, one Verava, Bolshevik emissary to Semiafakeal, proceeded to the latter&apos;s headquarters via Maku and Truazid.I expressed to the Armenian representatives my amazement at this reversal of their previous decision, reported in my telegram No. 315 of 6th July (Constantinople, 229), and said that their consent to Bolshevik occupation of Nakhitchevan, which opened their road into Turkey and north-west Persia, almost amounted to an act of revolt against Great Britain, and was particularly deplorable at the moment when Armenia had just received British munitions of war. The Armenians defended their action on the ground that they could resist no longer, arid asserted their continued loyalty to the Entente. They also claimed that the time which they will gain by the negotiations to be conducted at Erivan, will enable them to organize further resistance if the Bolsheviks do not ultimately evacuate (word tindecypherable). I am not satisfied that their military position was as desperate as they claim, although they were undoubtedly hard pressed. The text of the agreement follows by the first opportunity.   I wili endeavour to go to Erivan shortly.AUSTRIA.Payment of Private Debts [F.G.R., xxiii, p. 2J. Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 348] from Vienna on 9th August that the Austrian Government had addressed a note to him stating that with a view to concluding an agreement between the United Kingdom and Austria regarding the settlement of private debts contracted before and during the war, it had appointed as its plenipotentiary Mr. Richard Reisch, Secretary of State for Finances, and had instructed him to proceed to London with full authority to negotiate with the British plenipotentiaries, and to sign any arrangement that both parties might agree on. Mr. Reisch&apos;s fuR powers would be communicated to him as soon as they had been signed by the President of the National Assembly then at Gastein. In the meantime the written communication of the Austrian Government was to be regarded as investing Mr. Reisch with full authority.BALTIC STATES.Lithuania and Poland,. [F.C.R., xxiii, p. 2]. On 20th August Sir Horace Rumbold sent the following telegram [No. 731] from Warsaw : The Minister for Foreign Affairs told me to-day that he would try to come to an understanding with the Lithuanians. I observed that the Lithuanians might point to the treaty which they had concluded with the Bolsheviks. He replied that the Polish Armistice and Peace Delegation would point out to the Bolsheviks that the latter had assigned Polish territories to Lithuania. He would compulsory the Lithuanians that he had protested against this proceeding on the part of the Bolsheviks.His idea of a settlement with Lithuania was either a federation between the two countries or acquiescence in the Lithuanians holding so much territory with a Polish population as would ensure Polish rights being safeguarded. Although he was opposed to plebiscites he would be willing that these should be held in the territories in dispute between the two countries. Failing a direct settlement with Lithuania, he proposed to&apos;refer the Polish-Lithuanian question to the League of Nations.BULGARIA.Greek Attitude on the Frontier [F.C.R., xxiii, p. 4].-Lord Granville reported [No. 205 ?] on 10th August that it was true that many Greeks, among whom were some highly placed men, entertained the hope that Bulgarians would/join Tayar in. attacking them, which would afford them an opportunity of improving their frontier-in Western Thrace. It was quite possible that some of the wilder spirits had talked of being on the look-out for an excuse to attack the Bulgarians. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, however, had assured him that the Greek Government were fully alive to the necessity of not doing anything to put themselves in the wrong, and
although, in face of the rumours of Bulgarian intentions, they were bound to keep themselves prepared, there was no fear of any action on the part of the Greeks that would result in hostilities. 7 &apos;Economic Treaty with Czecho-Slovakia. Sir Herbert Dering reported [No, 95] from Sofia on 14th August the conclusion of an economic treaty, subject to ratification by both parliaments, between Bulgaria and Czecho-Slovakia. The treaty provides for the sale by Bulgaria of cereals, tobacco and hides. In return, Czecho-Slovakia undertakes to supply agricultural machinery, sugar, coke and certain particular articles such as wheel-tyres, &amp;c. Sir Herbert thought, it probable that an arrange-ment had already been made for the immediate sale by Bulgaria of 1,460 trucks of wheat and 2,000 trucks of maize. Payment was to be effected in (? French) currency on the basis of reciprocal compensation.THE CAUCASUS.British Prisoners at Baku [F.C.R., xxiii, p. 4].-On 11th August instructions were sent [No. 411] to Mr. Grant Watson at Copenhagen to request M. Litvinoff to transmit the following message to the Government of Azerbaijan and to inform him when it had been delivered : -&quot; The British representative at Tiflis has repeatedly endeavoured to enter into negotiations with you, in order to secure the release of the British subjects imprisoned or detained at Baku, but he has hitherto failed to obtain a reply from you. As a state of hostility does not exist, and never has existed, between Great Britain and the Republic of Azerbaijan, there can be no reason or justification for the continued detention of the British subjects within the territory of the Republic, and I have to request that you will immediately take steps to convey- to the Georgian frontier, with due regard for their comfort, the naval personnel and all civilians who wish to leave.&quot; Owing to the apparent difficulty of communication by other routes the Russian Soviet Government have undertaken to transmit this message via Moscow.&quot;Mr. Grant. Watson was also instructed to inform M. Litvinoff, that only the previous day it had been reported from Tiflis that British prisoners at Baku were suffering from the intense heat of confinement, and from vermin, and that Consul Hewelcke had now had a paralytic stroke.In reporting [No. 670] compliance with the above, on 14th August, Mr. Grant Watson said: M. Litvinoff states your message to the Government of Azerbaijan was forwarded by him through Moscow on 13th August. He states he has received, in the meantime, a message signed by the President of the Azerbaijan Republic, Mr. Nariman Narimanov, in which the latter emphasized protests against the assertions of the British Government that British prisoners are subjected by the Azerbaijan Government to ill-treatment. Nariman Narimanov assures him that the British representatives in Azerbaijan enjoy many privileges, and that the Georgian repre-sentative, Mr. Alishaba, after being permitted to interview the British representatives, expressed his thanks to the Azerbaijan Government for their attentive care of- the prisoners.With reference to the statement that the British prisoners at Baku are suffering from intense heat, Litvinoff wishes to remind the British Government of the fate of many Russian prisoners in Egypt, Turkey and India, who are also probably suffering&apos; from a climate to which they are not accustomed.He learns with surprise that Babushkin and his party, who were brought recently from India to England, are still in prison in spite of promises to or by the British Government for their speedy release. He fails to understand why these prisoners are being detained and not sent to Russia in accordance with the agreement of 12th February, under which nearly all Britishers from Russia have been repatriated, and requests a&apos;prompt reply from you on this point.Major Collas reported from Tiflis on 7th August that he had that day, received the following message from the Kyrov Mission through the Georgian liaison officer :  &quot;All British prisoners ,were released from prison on 5th August - and are now living in a private house outside the town of Baku. This does,not include Consul Hewelcke, who is in hospital. They.are receiving sufficient food, and ask. you not to send any niore money, b&apos;/ut would be, grateful.for tobacco, cigarettes and soap,&quot;
CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.- Official Declaration of Neutrality. Sir George Clerk reported [No. 138] on lOrh August that the Czecho-Slovak Press Bureau had issued that day an official Government declaration of neutrality and non-intervention in the war between Russia and Poland.Economic Treaty with Bulgaria. [See under &quot; Bulgaria,&quot; p. 3.]GERMANY.Food Conference. The following message was sent&quot; [No. 269] from the Foreign Office to Lord Kilmarnock at Berlin on 17th August: The German delegation presented to the Spa Conference on 12th July a memorandum dealing with the food situation in Germany, and asked that an international commission, composed of British, French, Italian, Belgian and German delegates, should meet as soon as possible in order to consider measures for improving the German food situation, and to submit concrete proposals in connexion therewith to the Governments represented at Spa,The Ministry of Food understand that the German Government would be prepared to send delegates to such a conference at an early date, and enquire whether London or Paris would be the more convenient. In any case the Ministry of Food are most anxious that the conference should take place on 21st August. Please telegraph reply urgently.The same message was addressed to our representatives in Paris, Rome and Brussels.The following reply [No. 495] was received from Lord Kilmarnock on 20th August : I have just received a note saying that the German Government will willingly send delegates to the food conference, and would much prefer it to take place in London rather than Paris. They fear their delegates cannot arrive before 23rd August.On receipt of the above, the Foreign Office telegrarjhed [No. 277] to Lord Kilmarnock as follows : We have been unable to arrange for the full conference to be held on 23rd August. The Ministiy of Food are, however, most anxious that the German delegates should come to London immediately to- discuss those food questions which are of mutual interests to Germans and ourselves.Please, therefore, ask the German Government to send their delegates to London at once. The meeting will be held on 23rd August, or as soon as possible after their arrival.We are informing the French, Italian, and Belgian Governments, and telling them that we shall welcome their delegates at this preliminary meeting if they are able to attend.The Financial Situation. In a despatch to Lord Curzon [C. 2971/8/18], dated 30th July, Lord D&apos;Abernon submitted a report on the financial situation of Germany, from which the following extract is taken : &quot; The governing fact to be remembered in economic and financial discussions respecting Germany, is that she is uncommonly near bankruptcy. Recovery is only possible through great skill on the part of her financial authorities, aided by careful nursing of economic factors on the part of all interested. The only chance of obtaining from Germany any large annuity towards reparation is intelligent assistance, enabling her to revive her agriculture and her industry.&quot;HUNGARY.Declaration of Neutrality. On 17th August, Mr. Athelstan Johnson reported [No. 471] the publication of the following official communique : On the 13th instant the Hungarian Government announced officially its abstention from participation in any military or diplomatic action which did not touch directly the interests of . Hungary. In spite of this definite declaration, reports have since appeared in certain foreign newspapers, stating that the Hungarian Government is planning military interference against Soviet Russia. In answer to these allegations, it is officially stated that the Hungarian Government clearly established their attitude in the above-mentioned note, consequently any report of contemplated military action is an irresponsible invention with no foundation in fact.19-4 B
JUGO-SLAVIA.Attitude loicards Hungary&apos;. Mr. Rattigan telegraphed TNo. 372] from Bucharest -on 17th August that he had been notified by the Serbian Charge d&apos;Affaires that, acting on instructions from his   Government,   he  had   informed  the   Rumanian Government that in the event of an attack by Hungary  Jugo-Slavia would not remain passive.French Evacuation of Cattaro.   On 16th August Lord Derby sent the following message [No. 985] from Paris : My naval adviser learns from his French colleague that the French Government have decided to evacuate the port of Cattaro on 1st October, with the result that the question arises as to who shall take over the arsenal at present held by the French. The naval advisers to the Ambassadors&apos; Conference have been consulted, and have recommended that the question ought to be settled by the Allied Governments direct. They suggest, however, two solutions: (1) to hand over the arsenal provisionally to the Jugo-Slav Government, who would have to give an undertaking not to make any military use of it until the question of the Adriatic has been definitely settled ; (2) if it is desired to maintain the inter-Allied character of the occupation, to arrange for one of the five principal Allied and Associated Powers to take over the arsenal.Telegraphing [No. 993] on the 18th August Lord Derby said that it was stated by the French naval authorities that the principal Allied Governments had been consulted and had agreed to the evacuation. That the French force occupying Cattaro is being contaminated with Bolshevism is given as the reason for evacuation. It is reported also, that although the French force holds the port the control of the forts is in the hands of the Jugo-Slavs, who will not permit any French approach to them.In reply to the above messages, Lord Derby was requested [No. 936] on 21st August to inform the French Government that His Majesty&apos;;- Government agreed to the evacuation of Cattaro by French troops.MEXICO.VillaSs Surrender. Mr. Cummins reported [No. 188] on 11th August that Villa had surrendered and was to be given full pardon, and all his followers were to receive a year&apos;s pay. The Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed Mr. Cummins that the action of the Government had been dictated by a desire for economy, as the campaign against Villa was. very costly.   They intended, however, to watch him closely.PERSIA.Improved Sitoiation-.- Mr. Norman, telegraphed [No. 578] on 16th August, from Teheran, that there had been a considerable improvement in the situation there. This was due to the decision of His Maj esty&apos;s Government not to reduce the Norperforce ; to the submission of Kuchik Khan and most of the Jangalis ; and to the initial success gained over an advanced detachment of the enemy. In view of this improvement Mr. Norman no longer contemplated the possibility of the capital having to be evacuated. Nevertheless, in order to avoid reprisals which might be invited by neglect of precautions, he announced that a scheme was in course of preparation, which would be submitted for the approval of the military authorities.POLAND.German Arms for the Soviet Army. On 20th August Sir Horace Rumbold sent the&apos;following report [No. 728] : The Minister for Foreign Affairs states that a considerable number of rifles of Mauser pattern, dated 1920, have been captured from the Bolsheviks. In addition to this, he stated that he was in possession of positive proofs that more war material of German manufacture has quite recently been shipped to Reval for the Soviet Army. He feels, therefore, that whilst Poland is practically boycotted with regard to the delivery of munitions and war material either through Czecho-Slovakia, Germany, or
Foreign - Policy. Telegraphing [No. 373] from Bucharest on 17th August, Mr. Rattigan reported a conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which the latter had said that the basis of his foreign policy was the establishment of a close understanding between all the minor Central European Powers, inciuding Bulgaria, and, if it were possible, Hungary. The entry of Bulgaria into the entente would be welcome, granted her sincerity, but the Minister would have no dealings with her at the expense of Greece.The Minister expressed his firm conviction, which he desired to be conveyed to Lord Curzon, that a grave mistake would be made by the Allies if they gave Eastern Galicia to Russia, and so separate Rumania from Poland. The Czeoho-Slovaks, he said, supported this proposal because they disliked the Poles, and were too short-sighted to recognize the serious danger of this common frontier with Russia. AVhen peace was arrived at, Russia could only be Bolshevik or Imperialistic, and in either case would remain a danger to the peace of Europe. To guard against this peril, the only way was to impose a Rumanian-Polish barrier between Russia and the rest of Europe. The Minister announced his intention of impressing this on the Czecho-Slovak Minister of Foreign Affairs, who was expected to arrive that day in Bucharest.Czecho-Slovak Desire for Alliance.-Mr. Rattigan telegraphed [No. 380] on 18th August; that the Czecho-Slovak Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him of the conclusion of a defensive alliance between Czecho-Slovakia and Jugo-Slavia, and of his desire that Rumania should also be included. Mr. Rattigan had already been told by the Rumanian Minister for Foreign Affairs that Dr. Benes had invited him to join, and that he had replied that he would do nothing without Greece. Mr. Rattigan told both Ministers that he considered that such an understanding would be a good thing, provided there was no underlying idea of aggressive action against any particular Power. It was obvious, in his opinion, that the uniting of all these States was being inspired by the fear of (? Russian) Imperialism.RUSSIA.British Subjects in Russia [F.C.R., xxiii, p. 10]. Referring to the last paragraph of his telegram conveying M. Litvinoff&apos;s reply to Lord Curzoris message [see under &quot; Caucasus,&quot; p. 4], Mr. Watson sent the following on 20th August :    ,M. Litvinoff once more draws the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the continued detention of Babushkin and his party from India, who are still prevented from leaving England for Russia. - The Soviet authorities regard this as a breach of agreement&apos;which may lead to the stoppage of the repatriation of British subjects from Russia.The following answer to the above was telegraphed [No. 416] by Lord Curzon to Mr. Grant Watson on 23rd August : Please convey to M. Litvinoff a message thanking him for the transmission of my telegram to the Government of Azerbaijan.As regards Babushkin and the party from India, M. Litvinoff is misinformed. They were released from prison over three weeks ago, as MrChicherin was informed at the time.SERBIA. \Attitude towards Poland. Sir Alban Young reported [No. 238] on 17th August that the present indications were that the Serb-Oroat-Slovene Government would maintain an attitude of neutrality as between Poland and her allies, if any, and the Russians. At the same time he thought that an attack by Hungary on any of her neighbours would probably result in Serbian intervention.Alliance with Czecho-Slovakia.-On 19th August Sir Alban Young telegraphed [No. 241] as follows :- . X       ^On the occasion of Dr. Benes&apos; visit, the alliance between Czecho-Slovakia and the Serb-Croat-Slovene State was announced.Dr; Benes, in an interview with Belgrade journalists, stated that the principal object of the alliance was to assure in common the faithful observance of the Peace Treaty with Hungary. It was also directed against the policy of those who.sought to revive the Austro-Umigarian Empire in the form of a Danubian Confederation.   As regards
the Russia and Poland conflict, the attitude of Czecho-Slovakia was one of strict neutrality. The frontiers of the Republic would be vigorously defended against aggression by any belligerent.Dr. Benes also told the Press that the object of his visit to Bucharest was the same as that of his visit to Belgrade. Pre added that the question as to what would happen if the Bolsheviks crossed the Rumanian frontier was not under discussion.Colonies for Russian Refugees. On 19th August the following proposal was sent [No. 165] from the Foreign Office to Sir Alban Young : Eight, or nine thousand Russian refugees are still being maintained by His Maj esty&apos;s Government in camps at Lemnos, Cyprus and Egypt. The charge is a heavy one and there seems no possibility of making the refugees self-supporting where they are. It has therefore been suggested that, if the Serbian Government are willing, the refugees should be gradually sent to Serbia and formed into colonies which would be organized by the British Committee of the Russian Red Cross and gradually7 become self-supporting.We realize that the Serbian Government could not agree if the proposal entailed fresh financial obligations for ihem. I should therefore be glad if you would approach the Serbian Government and enquire whether they would be prepared to allow colonies to be set up in that country, provided that His Maj esty &apos;s Government financed the scheme until the refugees were self-supporting or until they could be repatriated. ,Attitude towards Albania. Sir Alban Young, telegraphing [No. 243] on 23rd August, said that he had discussed Albanian questions the previous day with the Secretary-General for Foreign Affairs. The attitude of the Serbian Government was that the lines their troops occupy, in so far as they are within Albanian territory as defined in 1913, are the lines of demarcation as originally allotted to the Serbian army in 1918 by the Allied high command. They proposed to continue to occupy these lines until the Supreme Council has taken final decision as to the destiny of Albania. This question forms part of the general Adriatic question. They had strengthened their positions in the North-Western area by slight modifications. If the Albanians remained quiet, the Serbians had. no intention of making any advance, but they could not guarantee not to make xDtinitive expeditions, or to take the necessary measures for assuring the safety of their troops.In continuation of the preceding telegram Sir Alban sent the following [No. 244] :  The Secretary-General, who attributed the attacks made on Serbian troops by Albanians to Italian intrigues, suggested that we should address observations to Rome, pointing out that this Albanian trouble was a manifestation of one of the evils resulting from the failure of the Powers to secure a settlement of the Adriatic question.   He entreated that we should hasten to do so.Socialist journals here accuse this Government of bringing about Albanian attacks in order to furnish an excuse for penetrating into the country.TURKEY.French Military Position in Cilicia. Admiral de Robeck reported [No. 925] on 16th August that the latest information from Cilicia showed a decided improvement of the French, military position. About the end of July a French force had moved out from Adana to Mersina, defeating the nationalist forces at Yenidje and Gulek and relieving Tarsus. The railway between Tarsus and Adana being badly damaged, it was proposed to utilize the line from Alexandretta via Erzin, and also to construct a motor-road from Ayaz Bay to Adana direct.He was informed that the French, being reassured as to their position in Syria, now proposed to send strong reinforcements to Cilicia, and to clear the country of the  nationalist  forces.   They  had  about 5,000 Armenians under arms, besides volunteer irregulars, for whose use Greece has just shipped from the Piraeus 5,400 rifles -and 8,000,000 rounds of ammunition.The French Admiral Debon had left Constantinople for Alexandretta.Diplomatic Appointment.  On 21st August Admiral   de Robeck telegraphed&apos; [No. 938] the information that Nureddin Ferah Bey, at present Charge d&apos;Affaires at Madrid, had been appointed by the Turkish Government to be Charge d&apos;Affaires at Rome.
