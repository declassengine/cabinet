FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Attitude of Afghanistan. A telegram [No. 1729] from the Viceroy of India gives a broad view of how the Government of India gauged the attitude of Afghanistan in the later clays of December 1919. It was considered that while the Amir and Mahmud Tarzi were dominated by the desire to enlarge the boundaries of Afghanistan, and to create of it a strong independent State, they failed to realize the weakness of its resources, and its economic dependence on India. Their immediate hope lay in the prospects of expansion in Central Asia, which they thought they might secure by-friendly agreement with the Bolsheviks. The latter appeared to have made Hostility to the British Empire the sole condition of their friendship and support, and to have adopted pan-Islamism as their chief propaganda, a policy which is in accordance with Mahmud Tarzi&apos;s anti-British and pan-Islamic ideas. It is believed that the Bolsheviks were ready to make big territorial concessions in order to win over Afghanistan (vide sub Turkestan, page 9), but signs were not wanting that the Afghans might demand more than the Bolsheviks were prepared to give, and that serious friction between them might result. The policy of the Amir seemed to be to play the British off against the Bolsheviks, and to get as much as he could out of each. Two dangers appeared to arise out of this situation. The first was/that in order to distract the ambitions of the Amir from Central Asia, and to embroil him with the British, the Bolsheviks might induce him to join in an attack on Persia, professedly with the view of liberating that country from British dominance ; the second was, that should there be a great and successful development of the pan-Islamic movement, it might carry the Afghans with it and induce them to attack the British again, with such assistance as they could get from the Bolsheviks.Afghan Advice to North-West Frontier Tribes, Telegraphing [No. 500] on 9th Januaiy the Viceroy records the report that the Amir announced in. Durbar at Kabul on 14th December that orders had been given to General Nadir Khan to advise the North-West Frontier tribes to make peace with the British, as Afghanistan would give them no help.AUSTRIA.Coal Situation. Telegraphing from Vienna on 1st January Mr. Linclley reported [No. 2] as follows : The coal situation is now distinctly more critical than at any previous time. All passenger traffic has been stopped for the last 10 dajrs in Austria, and electric light and tramways in Vienna may cease altogether in the next few days unless the coal delivery increases.I took the opportunity of the Christmas holidays to pass 29th December at Prague, and Mr. Gosling was kind enough to take me to see both the President and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The coal. situation in Czecho-Slovakia is also serious, but from what I saw and heard I am convinced that the mismanagement of the railway^s is at the bottom of all our difficulties. The provision of extra trucks by the Allies may afford temporary relief, but will not solve the problem.The committee to be presided over by Sir F. Dent might have been most helpful, but it has never materialized. Had it clone so, it might have developed into an executive body with powders to order movements of rolling stock, help repairs, and generally manage the railways of the old Austrian Empire as one concern. Until some body exists with such powers I. see no hope of anything but a rapid decline into general chaos. As you are aware, society, and indeed civilization, depend on. transport, and the)7 will disappear in Central Europe unless it is placed on a sound, basis.1 think Professor Mazaryck was impressed by the general situation. He is evidently filled Avith envy and hatred of Vienna, but it might be possible to secure his hearty co-operation if Prague were made the centre of a joint body. Vienna is, of course, in every way the most convenient centre.
9 OTHE BALTIC.Baltic Conference. The Admiralty &quot; Weekly Appreciation &quot; No. 55, notes that the Conference of the Baltic States, which was to have taken place at Helsingfors on 4th January, to discuss the future attitude towards the Bolsheviks and basis for general means of defence, is postponed until 15th January to allow Poland to take part.The Latgallian Delegation at Moscow. -On 12th January Lord Acton reported from Helsingfors [No. 36] that the Latvian Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed his representative in Finland that this delegation had received no authority to negotiate peace with the Soviet; its functions were to endeavour to avoid the concen-tration of Bolshevik forces on the Latgallian front, and to settle the questions relating to prisoners of war and the revocation of hostages.Gcrmann and Latvia.   In his telegram of 12th January Lord Acton further reported that he had been informed by the Latvian Minister that Germany wished to establish diplomatic relations with Latvia, and that if that Power recognized the rights of all the Baltic States, his Government was disposed to concur.Speech at Libaa hy the Chief of the French Mission. On 12th January Mr. Whyte telegraphed from Libau [No. 7] the following abstract of a speech made by the Ohief of the French Mission, on 6th. January, to the soldiers of that place :  &quot; You know that France won the war. You know that more than 1,500,000 French were killed, more than the Americans, more than the English, more than the Italians, more than all the , Allies together.&quot; He said that France (group omitted) great (? friend of; Poland also, and that (? Letts) and Poles must work together. &quot; They come and want to take Walk and the Walk district from you. But do not allow them to steal what belongs to you. You must get it back, but for that you require a strong army.The speech had caused a great deal of feeling, especially amongst the Lithuanians who regarded it as a threat against themselves. It seemed extremely unfortunate that a speech which might be taken to imply a lack of co-operation amongst the Allies, and also encouraged discord between the Border States, should have been made by an Allied representative.In a telegram [No. 36] sent from Helsiiigfors on 12th January, Lord Acton said that the Latvian Minister had called his attention to this speech, from which&apos; he gave another quotation : &quot; It was France who regenerated Poland, and created, a powerful army for the Poles ; we shall do the same for Latvia, who has two enemies in common with France, the Bolsheviks and the Germans.&quot;Esthonia and General JudenicJi. On 3rd January the Deputy Commissioner at Reval reported [No. 117] that the Conimander-in-Chief, in view of the convention with Soviet Russia, had offered General Judenich the alternatives of withdrawing the Russian troops from the front, in which case they would be disarmed, or remaining in line and fully complying with the terms of the armistice. General Judenich, finding these terms unacceptable, had asked whether Great Britain would provide tonnage to enable him to transfer his army to South Russia. The Deputy Commis-sioner told him that the shortage of tonnage made this somewhat doubtful.BELGIUM.The Treaty of 1839. On 8th January Sir Francis Villiers telegraphed [No. 5] from Brussels as follows : -The Minister of Foreign Affairs has informed me this afternoon that the Belgian Government have decided, after a careful review of the recent negotiations at Paris, to accept the abrogation of the provisions in the Treaty of 1839 relating to independence without asking for any guarantee in substitution.The request for an interim guarantee is therefore withdrawn and there is no need to pursue the proposal referred to the League of Nations.THE CAUCASUS.Recognition of the Georgian and Azerbaijan GovernmenLs.-Oa 11th January the Foreign Office telegraphed [No. 23] to Mr. Wardrop informing him.that it had been
-unanimously decided by the Allied Supreme Council that the Georgian and Azerbaijan Governments should be accorded de facto recognition. On the following day Mr. Wardrop was further informed that this recognition did not involve any decision as to boundaries, and must not be taken to prejudge that question in any degree whatsoever.Note from the Georgian Government. On 6th January Mr. Wardrop reported [No. 5] that he had received a note from the Georgian Government of which the gist was as follows : The Bolsheviks having made an agreement with the Moslems to attack Great Britain, and the early collapse of General Denikin being probable, Trans-Caucasia becomes the bridge Great Britain must defend to prevent the union of the two-hordes.The situation in Georgia is becoming complicated on account of the advance of the Red army, and. without effective aid she will be unable to resist the attack from both North and South: the crushing of Georgia would be a serious matter for the Allies, but with their help she will be able to defend her frontiers. She considers that, in her own interests, Great Britain should help Georgia to defend herself, and help of&quot; the kind required would arouse an extraordinary outburst of enthusiasm and energy.Should, however, Great Britain deny the indispensable aid, Georgia may be forced against her will to save her existence by some desperate course.Mr. Wardrop&apos;s comments on the note were that he believed the Governments of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan to be prepared to do their best to defend their frontiers against invasion, and that there was reason for hoping that the defence would be successful if help were given without delay.The &quot; Chorok.&quot; Telegraphing from Constantinople on 31st December [No. 2199,. received 7th Januaiy], Admiral de Robeck reported that General Denikin had ordered the Ghorok to be returned to Georgia.Message for Georgia and Azerbaijan from Soviet, Russia. The following wireless message was despatched from Moscow on 6th Januaiy : In order to put an end to the vacillation and duplicity of the policy of Georgia and Azerbaijan towards Denikin, the People&apos;s Commissary for Foreign Affairs has sent a radio to the Governments of the peoples of Georgia and Azerbaijan containing proposals to conclude a military agreement between the military command of the above countries and the military command of Soviet Russia, with a view to united military action against Denikin.Azerbaijan Cabinet. On 24th December Mr. Wardrop reported [No. 232, received 3rd January] the formation of a new Cabinet composed as follows : -Prime Minister -without portfolio - Nassibek Ussubbekoff.Foreign Affairs - Rlian Khoiskv.War         - - General Mehmandarov.Interior        - Mahmed Hassan Gadjinsky.Justice      -          -          - - Khasmamedov.Welfare        - Musa Bey Rafiv.Communications, Trade and Industry Ivhudadat Bek Melik Aslanov.Finance     - - Kaplanov.Education            -             - - Hamid Bek Hahtinsky.Labour and Agriculture    - - Pepinov.Post -   -      -          -          - - Djamo Bek Gadjinsky.Controller -           -           - - Eibat Kuli Mamedhekov.CHINA.Attitude in regard to the Tibetan Question.  On 27th December, Sir John Jordan repeated to the Foreign Office [No. 652] a telegram he had sent to the Government of India in regard to China and the Tibetan question. He said that the action of the Peace Conference in transferring to Japan all German rights in China s most sacred province, without even a mention of the latter Power, had caused immense irritation, and our secret agreement with Japan was held partly responsible for what had happened. Sir John said that he was confident that China would complete the negotiations in regard to Tibet as soon as this feeling of hurt pride had passed away ; but for the unfortunate action of the Peace Conference the matter would have been settled in Pekin.
Note. The messages of the type hitherto sent from Nauen Wireless Station are now being-despatched from Norddeich in East Frisia, near Borktmi Island.7-3 BMongolia. On 12th January Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 16] to Sir John Jordan informing him that a formal protest against the Chinese action in Mongolia and the violation of the Russo-Chinese treaties had been made to the Allied Powers bv M. Sazonoff, who asked that they should join in the protest which was being made in Pekin by the Russian Minister. In a covering letter the Russian Embassy in London referred to a telegram received from that Minister reporting that the Chinese Government had decided to deprive him of his official character, to annul the extra-territorial rights of Russia, to annul the treaties with her, and to cease pajanent of the Boxer indemnity.   Lord Curzon asked for the observations of Sir John Jordan.&apos;-CZECHO-SLO slovakia.Attitude of the Bohemian Germans. The following wireless message was sent from Norddeich1 on 6th January: -The Germans of Bohemia have protested against the intention of the Czechish National Assembly to decide upon the Constitution before it is dissolved, and have declared that they refuse to recognize any Constitution created without the co-operation of the German Bohemians.GERMANY.Alliance Proposals in 1S99. The following wireless message was sent from Nanen on 30th December : Baron Eckkardstein, formerly Counsellor of Embassy in London, has had the second volume of his Memoirs published by Paul List of Leipzig. Eckkardsteim played a leading role in the negotiations for an Anglo-German Alliance proposed by chamberlain in 1899. During the war Eckhardstein was arrested and kept a prisoner a long time, with a view to getting from him the documents which were in his hands.   These documents have now been published.The German Unitary State. On 2nd January the following wireless message was sent from Norddeich : The struggle between the opinions whether there should be a Unitary State, or whether Bismarck&apos;s conception of a Germany formed on a Federal basis should be adhered to, continues to rage up and down the country in the Press and at meetings, though without decisive results being arrived at. At a meeting of the Farmers&apos; Union for South German;- held at Heilbronn the repre-sentatives of Bavaria, Baden, Hesse, the Palatinate, the Rhine Provinces and Wurtemburg pro tested against attempts to form a German Unitary State, which did not take into account the historical structure of the German people. The farmers of the South and West declared their adherence to Bismarck&apos;s conception of a Federal Germany. Attention is called at the same time to the view expressed by Professor Earl Duukmann as to the increased favour shown by the Catholic Centre and the Majority Social Democrats, especially by the former, to the idea of the unification of Germany.Goal Shortage. A further wireless message from Norddeich, dated 6th January, states that the shortage of coal in Berlin industries is again reaching a critical stage, owing to the cold which has again set in. The large Joint Stock Company of Ludwig Loewe has been idle for days, and a similar fate threatens to overtake other works. The shortage of coal is also spreading in Germany generaby. The dockyard industry at Bremen finds itself unable to get a supply of coal for as much as a week ahead, and thus the Joint Stock Company &quot; Weser &quot; has had to close. In the fishing-port of Geestemuende there are 50 fishing steamers lying idle. It is feared that in a short time the whole fishing industry will come to a standstill. In South Germany, too, the coal crisis is accentuated. At Frankfort on the Maine tranrways are to cease to run from 6th January and the deliveries of gas have had to be limited as far as possible.GREECE.Argyrokastro.  On 2nd January Lord Granville reported [No. 2] that the French Minister had received official information to the effect that the Greek Government
considered it necessary to occupy this place at once, as an Albanian Government had been set up there, which, if they waited, would become stronger and so make the occupation more difficult. The Greek Government had in these circumstances telegraphed for instructions to M. Venezelos.HUNGARY.Bolshevik Plot. Telegraphing from Budapest on Gth January [No. 51, Mr. Holder reported that details of a Bolshevik plot, which had been arranged in Vienna, had been communicated to the Allied Military Commission by the Hungarian Government. The object was to blow up the principal public buildings in Budapest, and to assassinate the chief personalities, Admiral hlorty being especially aimed at. It is said that Lenin is in easy communication with Bela Kun and his associates (whose imprisonment is alleged to be merely nominal), and is inciting them to the greatest activity as the prospects of the Bolsheviks are very flourishing.ITALY.The Question of Loans. On 8th January Lord Curzon telegraphed to Sir George Buchanan [No. 14] informing him : (1) That the Press reports in regard to loans are incorrect. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have agreed to the issue of a French loan in the London market, but the date, amount, and conditions of such loan have still to be discussed. The loan is to be a market loan, not a loan from His Majesty&apos;s Government (the amount will depend entirely on market conditions), and the proceeds are to be spent entirely in the United Kingdom.(2) Bis Majesty&apos;s Government had already agreed to a similar loan by Italy under paragraph 5 of the Financial Agreement of 8th August 1919, and the failure of the Italian TreasuiVs negotiations with London banks in September last was,, as was recognized by the Italian representatives at the time, in no way due to His Majesty&apos;s Government.(3) His Maj esty&apos;s Government are fully prepared to stand by the Agreement of August 1919, which places Italy in the same position as France is now in, as regards raising loans in London ; but it must be recognized that after the very heavy financial sacrifices of the war, during which a very large share of the expenditure of both Italy and France was provided by this country, the amounts now available for such loans are strictly limited.Italy and the Soviet. The following wireless message from the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs was sent from Moscow on 31st December: The Russian Soviet Government, having been informed by wireless of the resolution of the Italian Chamber laying clown that the resumption of relations with Soviet Russia was an object to be aimed at, and having also learnt the declarations of the Italian Government conceived in the same spirit, welcomes with pleasure statements which accord entireby with the true interests of the toiling masses of Russia, and have all the more prospects of realization now that the reoccupation of the Black Sea coast by Russian and Ukrainan Soviet troops, which will open the way to Italy, is likely soon to be effected. The Russian Soviet Government consequently proposes to the Italian Government that relations should at once be entered into with themselves.MEXICO.Attitude of the Government. On 2nd January Mr. Cummins reported [No. 2] an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who hoped that he would press. His Majesty&apos;s Government to recognize that of Mexico, now that General Aguilar had explained awajr many of the misconceptions. Mr. Cummins replied by referring to the restoration of British properties, whereupon the Minister had urged that each case required individual investigation. Mr, Cummins had then suggested that a way to that investigation should be found without delay, and the Minister had promised to mention the matter again to Carranza,
MOROCCO.Disturbances at Tangier.  On 8th January Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 1] to Sir Herbert White telling him that, according to information received from the Spanish Ambassador, the Spanish Government was making energetic protests to that -of France in regard to the occupation of certain posts in the town of Tangier by troops of the latter Power.   Sir Herbert White was asked for the facts.PANAMA. .Treaty of Peace with, Germany. Telegraphing from Panama on 8th January [No. 2], Mr. Bennett rej)orted that the Treaty of Peace with Germany had  been unanimously ratified that afternoon by the National Assembly without reservation or &apos; amendment.RUSSIA.Situation on tiie North of the Black Sea. The Admiralty &quot; Weekly Appreciation &quot; for the week ending 3rd January contains the following note : The situation on the North of the Black Sea is bad. The Volunteer Army, said to be outnumbered by 20 to 1, hope to hold the line Kherson to Berdiansk, and Rostov to Lake Manitch. A big defence scheme is also being prepared east of Perekop in order to save the Crimea. The Russians are short of coal, and Denikin has urgently asked for 20,000 tons total. The Commander-in-Chief has sent 2,000 tons to Odessa. It was. originally feared that Odessa would have to be evacuated in order to reinforce the Crimea front, and British transport Hannover was ordered there to assist with the evacuation of sick and wounded and women and children to the Crimea.The latest, report, however, dated 2nd January, from Geres at Odessa, states that situation has changed in so far that General Schilling has definitely stated that he will hold Odessa and is confident that he can do so. A general mobilization commenced on 1st January. At Nichoiaieff arrangements had been completed on 1st January to remove one cruiser, two or three torpedo boats and one submarine.Telegraphing from Odessa on 10th January [No. 11], Mr. Lowdon reported that the people of Odessa had no confidence in General Schilling as he had shown great apathy in the present crisis. It was generally considered that the only really reliable fighting elements were the German colonists in the region round Odessa ; but efforts were being made to organize the people of the city for its defence.The Hetman Pellura. Sir Horace Rum bold reported from Warsaw on 2nd January [No. 5] that it had come to his knowledge that Petlura&apos;s Government (Ukraina) had been reconstituted in that city. On the ground that in most other countries he would be hanged, the Polish Government would not expel him; but they did not recognize his Government, and were advising the Latvian Government, who had asked their advice, to follow the same course.   .Siberia.Message from Irkutsk. Telegraphing from Vladivostock on 3rd January^ Mr. Leggett reported [No. 3] that he had received the following message from Mr. Preston :--The French Military Representative here has handed me a telegraphic com-munication sent by General Janin from Irkutsk on 29th December to be-delivered to the Allied Diplomatic Representatives at Vladivostock, of which the following- is a translation :  We are -experiencing a crisis of which it is difficult to see the clear solution-Both the Government and the Socialists have tried to gain our military support. I have spared no effort to create a. neutral zone for trains of the Allied Diplomatic and Military Missions, and for the Czechs&apos; military trains which continue to arrive daily. -(? On 20th December) the Political and Military Delegates of the Government, being-admitted into the presence of the High Commissioners and the Czech Commandant, stated that, in view of the circumstances, we should give armed support to the
s-Government, We all refused tills as being against our instructions. Moreover, they presented no plan, military or otherwise. They were also very confused on the responsibility of the Government being pointed out to them. When Kappehs and semenoff&apos;s hostile telegrams were mentioned they said, &quot; Kappel and Semenolr are not the Government we are.&quot; They did not deny the fact that two clays previously the Admiral had sent to all the Atamans and to General Horvat an order to stop the Czechs by all the means in their power. This order was communicated to us from Harbin by the Czechs and the Japanese. As a result of this meeting the doyen of Corps Diplomatique, Mr. Kato, communicated to them the following decision which had been arrived at by the Conference of High Commissioners : &quot; Irkutsk, 26th December. The Allied High Commissioners have decided that the management of the railways and the telegraph between Krasnoyarsk and   Mysovaya inclusive, shall be placed in the hands of the General Officer Com-manding the Czecho-Slovak forces, who will hand the same over to the other Allied forces who replace them (behind Czechs there are Poles and Rumanians). &quot; These troops will be charged with the policing of both sides of the line as far as-it may be considered necessary for its proper protection, and will enforce the maintenance of order and neutrality. Action shall be limited in the towns of Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk to (? the immediate) vicinity of the stations. The movement of Allied military trains shall be controlled by them.&quot;The Japanese were invited to notify this decision to Semenoff and to stop his armoured trains. They acquiesced. However, Colonel Mike, who was charged with this notification, did not do so,under obscure pretexts. In concert with the British High Commissioner I lodged a complaint against this officer. At the present moment semenoff&apos;s armoured trains are 50 versts from Irkutsk and coming westward .... We know nothing of the Admiral apart from his order to stop the Czechs, which has not improved the feeling towards him.I am proposing to Mr. Kato a new course with the object of solving the crisis by peaceful means, at the same time asking him to notify Semenoff of the decision of the High Commissioners. If this result is not attained we may have an armed conflict and see the Czechs obliged to restrain Semenoff by force of arms.Under these conditions I should not. be able to answer for the fate of the Admiral and the trains of gold, or for that of some Ministers who have taken refuge in neutral trains at Irkutsk.Intended loithdrawal of American Troops. On 9th Januaiy Sir John Jordan reported from Pekin [No. 9] that he had been informed by the United States Military Attache that all American troops were to be withdrawn from Siberia, The Attache had been so informed by the American General Officer in command at Vladivostock.SERBIA.Food for Budapest.  On 3rd January Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 3] to Sir Alban Young, saying: Commander Domaille reports from Budapest that the food position there is serious ami complicated. The city is on half rations, has only one day&apos;s grain reserve, and insufficient daily amounts coming in. No supplies have arrived from Serbia, though trains and barges have been loaded for over six weeks and paid for. The elections will take place soon, and the Hungarian Government is therefore unwilling to requisition, as the peasantry are the only stable element in the country. If the Serbian and Rumanian supplies, which have been paid for, are sent forward at once, the food problem at Budapest will be settled for several months.Please bring to bear such pressure as \ou can on the Serbian Government with a view to the immediate export of foodstuffs to Hungary.SWITZERLAND.Reply of the Supreme Council to the Swiss Note. On 10th January Mr. Russell telegraphed from Berne [No. 8] as follows : The reply of the Supreme Council to the Swiss Note has caused considerable consternation in Switzerland, although only extracts have so far been published, and it is difficult to form any clear opinion ; it is possible that the version so far given in the Press may be erroneous.
The main point to which exception is taken is the reservation made hy the Supreme Council in regard to Switzerland&apos;s perpetual neutrality. The first four lines of Article 435 of the Treaty read in conjunction with Article 21 appeared to the Swiss, quite conclusive as regards the Allied recognition of Switzerland&apos;s neutrality. More-over, it is stated that most explicit assurances on this point were given both to the Swiss President and to Monsieur Rappard when they were in Paris by the French President, the French Premier, and Colonel House ; and surprise is expressed at the attitude adopted by the Supreme Council even in those organs which have been most strongly in favour of Switzerland&apos;s accession to the League.The (?) potential point is the constitutional necessity for Switzerland to submit the Parliamentary vote on the subject to a referendum. The negative reply of the Supreme Council on this point is at variance with the relevant portion of your Lord-ship&apos;s telegram No. 829, which had led the Federal Council to hope that a more generous view would be taken on this point.I learn on good authority that the Swiss President has been requested to proceed to Paris early next week to arriye at a satisfactory solution. The crux of the whole (groups obliterated) here is the danger that German Switzerland may not be induced to ratify the Parliamentary vote if the United States remain outside the League.I assume that it is considered eminently desirable that Switzerland should be brought into the League as an original member. Having regard to this and the very strenuous efforts on behalf of the League, which have been made by the Federal Council and all those in favour of accession, I venture to express the hope that nothing-will be done which will render their task more difficult. It is recognized in authoritative circles here that the Swiss Note was clumsily worded and the Swiss President will be no doubt in a position to remove some misapprehensions which have X^ossibly evoked the reply of the Supreme Council.TURKESTAN.Bolshevik Anticipations and Difficulties. Gn 31st December 1919 the-Viceroy of India transmitted [No. 17360] a telegram from General Malleson reporting that the Bolsheviks anticipated that the fall of Krasnovodsk would entail the final collapse of Denikin and the opening of a 1920 campaign against the English everywhere in Asia. The Caspian Fleet was expected to come over and to turn Bolshevik. Thus assured of the command of the Caspian, they would be able to enter on a wide programme, to include revolution throughout the Caucasus, the invasion of northern Persia, a Turkish national movement on Mesopotamia, and finally the encouragement, if not the forcing, of a renewal of hostilities between Afghanistan and India. The access to Baku would relieve them from all danger of collapse for want of oil and fuel, and they would be able to cany out the whole of the proposed programme. The principal difficulty of the Bolsheviks appeared to be that of money. Notices were being posted by them throughout Turkestan, begging the population not to believe the lying state-ments of the British Mission in Meshed regarding the worthlessness of rouble notes. The Bolsheviks were everywhere trying to induce foreign countries to accept their paper in return for much-needed commodities. It was even said that they were offering large territorial concessions to Afghanistan and Bokhara provided their paper money received official recognition.Growth of Bolshevism in the East. The following wireless, message was sent on. 10th January from Moscow to Tashkent for purposes of propaganda : According to the Times, the whole of Turkestan is under the power of the Bolsheviks. The Times adds that the domination of the Bolsheviks in a large part of European Russia and on the whole of Western Siberia is now an undisputed fact. The Supreme Council has had a consultation on the recent spread of the Bolshevik movement in the Balkans, in Asia and other Allied Colonies (sic). No decision was arrived at as to the measures for combating Communism. Britain informs the Allies that the British Government, as a consequence of the growth of Bolshevik agitation, has increased its military forces in all parts of the Empire.TURKEY.Feeling in Central Asia, in regard to Constantinoplc-Oii 4th January the Viceroy of India transmitted a message from General Malleson, dated 1st January.7-3 (0 -
General Malleson said that al] his information went to show that if the Turks were turned out of Constantinople, the news would leave Central Asia cold. In that -area, at any rate, the whole business was a purely political agitation, with no flavour of real religious feeling about it. run by Jews and infidels in the interests of the young-Turks and the Bolsheviks. Moreover, the agitation had probably not produced a single recruit, for it had fallen singularly flat. For many months past he had been making-careful and detailed enquiries, throughout the area to which he had access, in regard to the pan-Islamic propaganda: The result was his conviction that there was not the slightest enthusiasm for the Caliph or for Turkey ; the inhabitants of Central Asia would not risk their skins for either. There was the same apathy in Western Afghanistan, whilst the Persians regarded Turkey as their hereditary enemy. So far as that area was concerned, the agitation was absolutely hollow and without significance.Note to High Commissioners.   On 8th January Admiral Webb telegraphed [No. 22] the following summary of a note (the full text of which had been already published in the local Press), addressed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the three Allied and American High Commissioners on 6th Januaiy, with a request that the con-clitions contained in it might be submitted to the attention of the Peace Conference : The Ottoman Government while realizing the situation in which, the war has left Turkey, considers that the right of political existence of a people cannot be impaired by defeat in war, and invokes the principles enunciated by President Wilson and accepted by the Allies. Any solution prejudicial to unity and sovereignty would result in an endless succession of disturbances in the East,The failure of the reforms which Turkey has attempted to introduce on previous occasions was due to unfortunate circumstances. The Porte is now sincerely anxious to adopt a new organization on the basis of judicial, financial and police reform, and the guarantee of the rights of minorities.The Porte is ready to accept the assistance of one of the Great Powers in this task in such a manner as neither to encroach on Turkish independence nor offend the national pride.The note encloses (?a draft proposal for the) formation of a &quot; Corps d Inspection Judiciaire,&quot; and announces that drafts of reforms in other administrative departments will follow.The main features of the proposals for judicial reforms are :  (1) The institution of a Corps of Inspectors consisting entirely of foreigners ; (2) The creation of a Grand Council at the Ministry of Justice, mainly Turkish; and(3) The appointment of  a foreign Director-General with  two assistant and provincial agents, who may also be foreigners, to supervise the native Police Judiciaire.&quot;It is proposed to invest the foreign element in this scheme with certain limited executive functions.In regard to the previous publication of this note in the Press, Admiral Webb telegraphed on 10th Januaiy [No. 31] as follows : The French High Commissioner raised the question of this note at the meeting of the High Commissioners on 9th Januaiy. He proposed a collective note to the Porte and insisted on it all the more because he believed the discourtesy of its procedure to have been semi-official, as the note had been kept secret till the eve of publication, and- the IJnder-Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had called at the High Commissions on other business as late as 8th Januaiy, had made no mention of it.He (Admiral Webb) had entirely agreed with the essence of what the French High Commissioner had said.    The Italian High Commissioner had also agreed,. -though with obvious reluctance. There was a difference of opinion, however, as to -whether the pu blication of the note without consultation with the High Commissioners. was theoretically incorrect as a matter of diplomatic procedure. It was decided to modify the French High Commissioner^ draft note so as to glide over this point without mitigation of the severity of the rebuke, and the modified collective note had been sent to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that day. The gist of it was contained in the last paragraph, of which the following is an abridged translation : In these circumstances the High Commissioners, while not proposing to publish the present documents, as they would be entitled to do, inform the Porte that they consider as null and void the note under reference, of which their Governments will, in any case, have been sufficiently apprised by means of the Press.
