FOREIGN   COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Bolsheviks and Afghans. On 13th December Sir John Jordan reported [No. 626r received 20th December] that the Russian Minister in Peking had received a telegram, from the Russian Consul at Kashgar informing him that the Bolsheviks had come to an agreement with Afghanistan to whom they had ceded the Kushk-Merv area, and that the occupation of the Pamirs by the Afghans was expected.Telegraphing on the ISth December [No. 16862], the Viceroy said that General Malleson&apos;s Merv agent had also reported that according to the Afghans the Kushk-Merv area had been ceded to them ; whilst on the following day he reported [No. 1708 S.] that information had been received from Kashgar to the effect that efforts were being made hy the Afghans to induce the Moslems of the Russian Pamirs and Ferghana Syrdaria to join them and the Bolsheviks against us. There was also a report to the effect that the Afghans [? intended] to proclaim their possession of part of the Russian Pamirs.ARGENTINA.Strikes. Telegraphing from Buenos Ayres on 21-th December [No. 288], Sir Claude Mallet reported as follows : Strikes, fomented by agitators, have broken out on the properties of the Forestal Land, Timber, and Railways Company, Limited. Coinsiderable destruction of property has occurred, and in some cases the managers and staff were deprived of their liberty by the strikers. The British employees appealed to me for protection, and, at my request, the Argentine Government are taking prompt measures to maintain order.In the general situation there are disquieting symptoms. Agitators threaten incendiarism of crops and property if the prisoners under arrest as instigators of the disorders are not released by 20th January.There are predictions of strikes and subversive movements in January, but at present these are vague and indefinite. The Government issue reassuring statements and profess complete confidence in their ability to deal with the situation.AUSTRIA.Suggested Economic, Union of Salzburg with Bavaria. On 17th December Mr. Lindley reported [No. 56] as follows : At yesterday&quot;s session of the Salzburg Diet the provincial Governor introduced the following motion drafted by the Constitution Committee :-Considering that various efforts of the Provisional (? provincial) Government of Salzburg with the provincial Government of Upper Austria and the State Government at Vienna for an economic union with the Inn district of Upper Austria, whose economic centre the town of Salzburg has always been, have met with no success, and that further efforts of a similar kind do not offer much prospect of success before the new year, and in view also of the fearful distress of the Salzburg district which demands extraordinary measures in order to save the people, the Lodul (? Local) Govei-nment is instructed to address a request through the State Government to the Supreme Council in Paris that the latter will at least render possible the economic union of Salzburg with Bavaria.This motion was carried unanimously. Following the lead of Vorarlberg and Tyrol, Salzburg is the third of Austria&apos;s seven provinces to demand, separation.The -promised Flour from Trieste. On 22nd December Mr. Lindley telegraphed from Vienna [No. 61] as follows : I to-day saw the State Chancellor, who informed me that no part of the 3,000 tons of flour promised him at Paris had yet left Trieste, and the town was again threatened with a complete lack of bread. . . .1 have no means of judging why the flour is not moved, and only know that the whole situation depends on its arrival here.
1oIn regard to this telegram Lord.Curzon telegraphed [No. 919] as follows to Sir George Buchanan on 21th December:   The Italian Eepre3entatives, both in Paris and here, have during the last few days been profuse in assurances to competent authorities that instructions have been sent to begin moving the 30,000 tons of food-stuffs from Trieste. Grain is vitally needed to prevent Vienna from starving, and all arrangements for payment and for replacing the necessary shaping to the Italian Government have been made to the satisfaction of the Italian authorities. The above-mentioned assurances given to us are categorical and unconditional.Please immediately express to the Italian Government the grave anxiety caused to His Majesty&apos;s Government by the-above information, which is confirmed by the latest report from the British Relief Mission. You. should press for an explanation and urge them to take the necessary steps without delay.In reply to this, Sir George Buchanan telegraphed [No. 773] on 2Gth December as follows : The Commercial Attache spoke to Signor Foticchia, head, of the Provisioning Department, on 23rd December, when I received Mr. Liiiclley&apos;s telegram regarding the 30,000 tons of flour promised to Vienna. He was informed that the Italian Govern-in ent had telegraphed on 22nd December to Trieste, ordering the despatch of 9,000 tons of flour, and was assured that the remaining 21,000 tons would be sent from Venice, beginning 1st January, till the amount was completed.On 28th December Mr. Lindley reported [No. 70] that the Italian Prime Minister had telegraphed to the State Chancellor informing him that the deliveries had begun and would be continued uninterruptedly with the greatest possible rapidity.Supplies detained by Polish Military Authorities. -On 23rd December [No. 64, received 29th December] Mr. Linclley telegraphed as follows : I have just learnt that the first train of foodstuffs sent from Czernowitz in Rumania for Vienna has been held up by the Polish Military Authorities at Stanislav station, by order of the Chief of Staff at Lemberg. These trains are entitled to free transit by virtue of an Austrian and Polish agreement.THE BALTIC.Agreement between Esthonia and Soviet Russia. Telegraphing from Helsingfors on 20th December [No. 776], Lord Acton reported as follows : The Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that in the negotiations between the Esthonians and Soviet Russia held on 5th December, the delegates from both parties agreed on the followins: Questions :  1. Russia   declares  that  she  recognizes  in  principle  the  independence   of Esthonia.2. Esthonia is not responsible for Russians public debts. -&apos;). Conditions for the exchange of prisoners of war.4. Agreement on the question of the Avar indemnity, except in so far as themaintenance of prisoners of war is concerned. 5. Russia recognizes in principle the right of Esthonia to its proportional share.of the gold deposited in the Russian Treasury. 0. Agreement as to the organization of diplomatic and consular relations.   , 7. Agreement as to the reciprocal rights of Russians in Esthonia and of Esthoniansin Russia.In regard to the delimitation of the frontier, opinions (? differed), the first proposal of the Esthonian Delegates having been flatly rejected by the Russians. The counter proposal of the Russians was rejected by the Esthonians, because it was not based on ethnical considerations, and did violence to the right, of nations to determine their own destinies. Throughout the Conference the conduct of the Bolshevik Delegates was most exacting and insolent, and their attacks against the Narva line did not cease, during the period of negotiation.On 26th December the Deputy Commissioner at Reval- reported [No. 114] that he had been informed by one of the Esthonian Delegates that on the 24th the Bolshevik. Delegates had practically accepted the armistice proposals which had been made to them. In regard to the frontier proposals, if the Esthonians destroyed all fortifi-cations on the west bank of the Narova, the Bolsheviks would establish a neutral zone, 10 kilometres in breadth, immediately to the east of that river. Whilst in regard to the Russian north-west army the terms were (1) that its personnel should be liquidated,
(2)-that for a period of two years.its property should be interned in Esthonia, and (3) that all supplies lent by other countries should, within a period of six months,, he returned to those couutries.M. Trotsky on the Relation of Soviet Russia to the Border States. On 25th December the following wireless message was sent out from Petrograd : The following-report was made by M. Trotsky at a Special Conference of the Petrograd Committee of Defence, which was held with M. Zinovieff as President : Our situation on the Southern and Eastern fronts cannot alter our policy with regard to the small. Western States which before formed part of the Russian Empire. Our aim is not to conquer States and peoples, but to influence them with our work..of. Socialist construction.. Therefore at present our chief task with regard to Finland, Esthonia, and the other Western States is to obtain speedy peace on the principle of a recognition of the independence of these States on our part, provided that they promise not to take part in any criminal campaigns against Soviet Russia, and to fulfil the clauses of the treaty. Owing to the duplicity displayed by the Governments of the Western States, until guarantees are received by us we must be vigilant and ready to act should Soviet territory be in danger. With regard to Finland, we must stand by the former resolu-tion ; should there be any attempt on the part of the Finnish White Guard troops to attack us, we must meet such attacks with decisive blows.Esthonia and the,Letts. Telegraphing from Riga on 24th December [No. 296], Mr. Dewhurst reported that the Lettish Government was sendiiig a deputation to Reval on 2nd January to discuss the frontier question with a view to its settlement. Mean-time the Esthonian Commander-in-Chief had intimated that if the Lettish Government institutions had not left Walk and the northern district by 29th December, they would be expelled by force.THE CAUCASUS.The Azerbaijan and Armenian Conference. On 15th December Mr. Wardrop reported [No. 205] that the following telegram, in English, had been received from Baku addressed to Colonel Haskell and Mr. Wardrop : 14-th December. First session of the Azerbaijan and Armenian Conference took place, inaugurated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who on the part of the Government addressed the Assembly . . . . After the opening of the Conference, Khan Khoisky presiding, he delivered a speech of greeting remarking that the present Conference opened in conditions favourable for a successful conclusion of its work, as the ground for it had been prepared by previous conferences which had worked out the Avay to solring all the questions to be discussed between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The Chairman of the Armenian Delegation, Arouturian, on greeting the Azerbaijan people in a free Azerbaijan, expressed the hope&quot; that the Conference would yield positive results. ... In compliance with the wish of some of. the members, wrko, on being made acquainted with the questions put forth by both Governments, expressed the necessity for complementary questions, the Conference decreed the presentation by the respective delegations of a complete programme of questions liable to discussion on the next sitting of the Conference, fixed for Wednesday the 17th December. In these conferences the chair will be taken alternately by the chairman of the respective delegations.Relacions between Georgia and General Denikin. On 22nd December Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 1-12] to Mr. Wardrop instructing him (in view of the serious concern with which the present strained relations were viewed by the Foreign Office and the War Office) to endeavour, without trying to apportion the responsibility for the situation, in conjunction with General Holman, to bring about a settlement between Georgia and General Denikin on the following basis : (1) General Denikin to release the &quot; Chorok,&quot; and to abandon ali economic measures directed specifically against Georgia or Transcaucasia; (2) the Georgians to retire to the llzyb, and to undertake not to proceed with the expulsion of Russian nationals from her territory; and (3) British control officers to be placed in the Gagri zone to prevent any infringement of the terms. -The Bolsheviks on the Caspian.; On 26th December Mr. Wardrop transmitted [No. 234j a message from Colonel Stokes, who said that unless prompt measures were taken it was probable that the Bolsheviks would have control of the Caspian at no distant date ; their fleet was only prevented from coming south by lack of fuel.
DENMARK.Agreement loilk Soviet Russia.  Telegraphing from Copenhagen on 26th Decem-ber, Mr. Grant Watson reported [No. 1775] that an agreement had been concluded between. M. Litvinoff and the representative of the Danish Foreign Office on the following lines :-  .I. The Danish Government to forward to an agreed place all Russian prisoners of war in Denmark as soon as they were notified that the latter could reach Russia and the necessary tonnage was placed at their disposal.II. The Soviet Government to allow the Danes in Russia to leave as soon as military conditions permitted. If the return of other nationals in Russia were rendered possible, the Danes would be among the first to receive permission to leave. Efforts would be made to repatriate Danish women and children, and if possible the sick also at the first opportunity at the latest when other foreigners, the military of the Entente countries and civilians, could leave Russia.III. The Danish Government to open a credit in favour of the Soviet Government on account of the expenses of the Soviet prisoners in Denmark.IV. The Soviet Government to open a credit in favour of the Danish Government on account of the Danes in Russia at the rate of 150 roubles a day per person to be distributed by Mr. Eigtved and another representative of the Danish colony.A7. The credit mentioned in paragraph IA7. to be deducted from the Soviet&apos;s debt to Denmark. The exchange value of the rouble to be settled later by telegraph. Thereupon the agreement to come into force.ATI. The Soviet Government to allow the import of food and clothes for Danes up to 1,000 kilogrammes. This consignment to be free from requisition, and to be despatched together with a similar English consignment.The text of the agreement, Mr. Grant AVatsou added, had not been published.FINLAND.Recognition of the Government of White Russia.-On 17th December Lord Acton, telegraphing from Helsingfors, reported [No. 759] that the recognition by Finland of the Government of White Russia, as the ale facto Government of the country, had been announced semi-officially.ITALY.Fiume. On 29th December Sir George Buchanan reported [No. 775] that he had had a conversation with the President of the Council, who had remarked that the situation at Fiume was becoming critical. The majority of the population was indeed on the side of the Government, but D&apos;Annunzio was supported by a small band of extremists ; for that reason he, the President, propjosed to occupy the town with Italian troojis, on the pretext of maintaining order, at the first favourable moment.POLAND.Policy of the New Government. On 20th December [No. 499, received 24th December] Sir Horace Rumbold reported as follows : On 18th December Mr. Skulski, the new Prime Minister, laid before the Diet an expose of the new Governments policy.The expose, which began by an expression of respect and gratitude to Mr. Paderewski, was couched in general terms.&quot; The programme includes social reform on wide democratic lines, an energetic effort to cojie with the food situation with increased rations for persons engaged in hard manual labour, labour legislation such as the 8 hours&apos; day and the 46 hours&apos; working week, assistance to workmen .&apos;s co-operatives, and the erection of workmen&apos;s houses and colonies.As regards agrarian reform, the Government not only undertake to do all in their power to ensure the cultivation of all the arable land in the country, but also to put into force the statute which has been passed by the Diet in such a way as to satisfy the claims of the landless and small landed peasants. Parcellation on a large scale will he carried out, and the Government will not hesitate to resort to expropriation in districts where the State does not possess enough land. 7-1 B
In the domain of reconstruction, immediate effect will be given to the statute of, 18th July 1919. Canals will be built and the. courses of various rivers, first and ( foremost of the Vistula, regulated, in connexion with which a Bill will be laid before the Diet. Another Bill will be presented relative to the erection by the State of buildings designed to meet the lack of accommodation in the towns. A third Bill to be laid before the Diet will deal with education, which is to be on the lines of a uniform seven years&apos; system:As regards finance, the preparations which have already been begun are to be hastened with a view to unifying the currency all over Poland and to introducing a new Polish currency with a fixed ratio to foreign currencies. The Government further hope by means of foreign loans and of increased export of goods to raise the value of Polish money and thus to combat the increasing clearness of all articles in Poland. In any case they will not cover deficits in the Budget by increasing the amount of paper money in circulation. Increased revenue will be raised by taxing-war profits, income, and legacies.The Government hope to increase the output of the Polish coal fields, and they have already taken steps to procure from the neighbouring States, against compensa-tion, articles necessary for the economic life of the country.Large but somewhat vague reforms are promised in the respective domains of the Ministries of the Interior and Railways.The proposed Constitution will be revised, and it is further stated that the experience of the in-esent Diet has shown the necessity that both Diet and Senate should participate in the National Assembly, which has the right of electing the Head of the State.As regards foreign affairs, the motto of the new Government will be the same as that of the old, viz., the creation of a. powerful Poland supported by the Allies. Only a close alliance with the Western Powers can guarantee Poland the possibility of successful development. Allusion was also made to the desirability of a speedy ratification of the Peace Treaty in order that the frontiers of Poland might&quot;be definitively established, and to the protest which has been lodged by the Polish Delegates in Paris against the decision of the Peace Conference regarding Eastern Galicia ....It is gratifying to note that the British Police Mission now in Warsaw received an indirect compliment as, under the heading of administrative reforms, Monsieur Skulski stated that, in co-operation with the Ministry of Justice and the British Police Mission, the Ministry of the Interior would improve the police in the large towns by relieving it gradually of administrative duties and by transferring the right of punishment from it to magistrate^ courts and to the proposed police courts.RUMANIA.Changes in the Cabinet. On 17th December [No. 571, received 29th December] Mr. Rattigan reported as follows : The resignations of General Averesco and Mr. Goga have now been confirmed. The following changes have consequently taken place in the Cabinet : Mr. Vlacl takes over provisionally the Ministry of the Interior. Mr. M. Bontesco becomes Minister of Commerce and Industry. Messrs. M. Mihalache and Borcea, of the Peasants&apos; Party, become respectively Ministers of State Domains and of Education.RUSSIA.M. Litvinojf and Denmark.   On 19th December Mr. Grant Watson telegraphed [No. 1752] from Copenhagen that M. Litvinoff had informed the Danish Red Cross Delegate that his Government wished to obtain permission for their representative to remain in Denmark and pointed out the commercial advantages which Denmark wordd in consequence enjoy. The Danish Government would, however, not agree to this.M. Litvinoff&apos;s request to Sweden. Mr. Barclay telegraphed [No. 1170] from Stockholm on 17th December that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that M. Litvinoff had asked the Swedish Delegates If it would be possible for him to go
to go to Stockholm. The Minister had declined to give any reply to the request. It had keen suggested that Litvinoff was afraid to return to Russia, but the Swedish Government did not intend to let him go to Stockholm.The Copenhagen Negotiati.ons.-On 29th December the following telegram [No. 1541] was sent from the Foreign Office to Sir&apos;Eyre Crowe in Paris:-As yon are doubtless aware, we, have for some time past been negotiating with M. Litvinoff at Copenhagen through Mr. 0&apos;Grady, M.P., for the exchange of British prisoners of,war and civilians in Russia. Mr. 0&apos;Grady is now in London, having come to discuss M. Litvinoffs proposals more fully than could be done by telegram.,. The two conditions made by the Soviet Government on which the negotiations hang are : -(1) The release of certain Soviet prisoners of war captured in North Russia and left in the hands of the Archangel Government when the Allied troops evacuated that area. This, we foresee, will involve considerable difficulty, as we do not know where these men are or even if they are still alive. We are approaching Monsieur Sabline ; and (2) permission for the Soviet Government to have a representative of their own on the International Commission at Berlin, for the purpose of controlling the repatria-tion of the Russian prisoners in Berlin. We have fully discussed this point with General Malcolm, who, apart from the political aspect of the question, sees no practical difficulty in meeting such a request, especially as the Commission is not yet in existence. The object of the Soviet Government is, of course, to counteract the influence of Colonel Brandt. The only objection which could be raised is that such a step might foreshadow the ultimate recognition of the Soviet Government; we do not hold this view, -as there does not appear to be any material difference between the appointment of a Soviet representative and that of a Kolchak-Denikin representative as the brttePs Government has not been recognized either. We feel, however, that the matter must be one for the Supreme Council.Siberia.The Kolchak Government. Mr. Butler telegraphed [No. 1005] from Vladivostock on 19th December that Mr. Lampson at Irkutsk had informed, him that the Minister for Foreign Affairs viewed the situation as becoming more serious every moment on account of the delay in the arrival of Admiral Rolckak and M. Pepelaieff. Until they reached Irkutsk there would be no possibility of stabilizing the Government. The Minister regarded as essential: (1) the despatch of Japanese troops to Irkutsk to strengthen the existing Russian garrison against local Bolshevik uprisings; (2) economic assistance by which alone the conditions of living amongst the population could be improved.   Mr. Lainpson supported both these propositions.Telegraphing [No. 1010] on 22nd December Mr. Butler transmitted to the Foreign Office a further telegram from Irkutsk reporting that the Mayor, who is a member of the Socialist Party, which provides 74 out of 75 members of the municipality, is entirely opposed to Admiral Kolchak and his Government. The arrival of Admiral Kolchak, in his opinion, would hasten the fall of the Government.State of the Raihcay Communications. On the same date Mr. Butler reported [No. 10091 a further message from Mr. Lainpson at Irkutsk to the effect that Admiral Kolchak had despatched an excited telegram, over his own signature and en clair, to the foreign diplomatic and military representatives, in which he accused the Czechs of holding up his trains, attempting to seize his locomotives, and so delaying the traffic as to cause suffering to the sick and wounded and to women and children.The Czechs&apos; only object was to get out of the country, and they had assumed control of the transport organization, which was in a state of chaos on the line. They were undoubtedly acting in a high-handed manner, and insisted on the priority of their programme of evacuation.On 23rd December Mr. Butler reported [No. 1012] having sent a message to Irkutsk that the Inter-Allied Railway Commission had discussed the deplorable state of the railway as regarded congestion, and had decided to send the following telegram to the Minister of War at Irkutsk : &apos;&quot; The position of the railways has reached such a deplorable state that the Inter-Allied Committee feel that their position (&apos;? must be) clearly outlined to all concerned.&quot; Hence the Committee must ask that the following conditions be complied with, at once (&apos;? or) else it and its subordinate boards can no longer continue their endeavours.&quot;7-1 C
Here &quot;follow certain conditions for regulating the. traffic, which the Allied Military Commanders are to be called-upon to enforce.   The-telegram concludes :- &quot; Conditions are now so serious at vladivostock, and in fact at all points along the line, that an answer must be given to these conditions-(?. by) the Russian Govern-ment by noon, 26th December to their proposals, or else the Committee will not feel any responsibility . for the railways, and will so (? notify) their respective Governments.&quot;- . TURKESTAN.Bokhara. On 18th December the Viceroy transmitted [No. 16815] a ,telegram from General Malleson reporting that some Russian officers had reached.Meshed from Bokhara and had given him information in regard to the inhabitants of that place. They stated that the Bokharans were strongly opposed to the Bolsheviks, though the Amir outwardly assumed a position of neutrality. All the people of Turkestan were hoping for help from General Denikin as they were sick of the Bolshevik oppression.In his telegram of 13th December [No. 626] Sir John Jordan reported that complete independence had been promised to Bokhara if it sided with the Bolsheviks.-   TURKEY.Appeals from the Armenian and Greek Patriarchates. Telegraphing [No. 2132] on 9th December, Admiral de Robeck reported that urgent appeals had been addressed by the Armenian and Greek Patriarchates to the three High Commissioners, pointing out the alarming situation of returned refugees and other Christian dependent religions. Owing to the prolongation of the armistice, the resources of the various relief organizations had. been exhausted before a settlement of the Turkish question had been arrived at, and hundreds of thousands of destitute Christians were exposed to a lingering death by starvation, cold and disease during the winter which had already set in. Voluntary effort was quite inadequate to deal with the present requirements, and no help could be expected from the Turkish Government, which&quot; was primarily responsible for this.They asked whether it was not possible to obtain from the Allied Governments an advance or grant for relief purposes such as was made at the beginning of the year to various countries through the Supreme Economic Council, to be recovered from Turkey in the financial settlement on the conclusion of peace.The Greek Patriarchate suggested a grant of 1,000,000Z. sterling as sufficient to tide over the winter. The Armenian Patriarchate asked for 2,000,0(J0Z. sterling, and added that this sum could be fully guaranteed by the (&apos;? immense) quantity of Armenian property confiscated by the Turkish Government at the time of the massacre (group undecypherable) still held by them under the iniquitous Einvali Metruke Law, the repeal of which had been demanded by the High Commissioners.The proposals would be discussed at the High Commissioners&apos; meeting on Friday, 12th December, but in the meanwhile he submitted them for favourable consideration as presenting what seemed to be the only means of preventing an appalling mortality amongst the suffering populations of Turkey from famine, privation and disease.UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.Recognition of British Protectorate over Egypt. On 28th December Lord Grey reported [No. 1692] from Washington that the Secretary of State had addressed a letter to Senator Em, who was acting on behalf of the Egyptian Nationalist Delegation there, in the following terms : &quot; I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 29th November last, in which you enquire as to effect of this Governments recognition of (? Egypt) called protectorate proclaimed by Great Britain over Egypt on 18th December.&quot; In reply I beg to state that the Department does not understand that Egypt was prior to the British proclamation of 18th December 1914 in possession of full independence of sovereign rights.&quot; The effect of this Governments qualified recognition of April 1919 was to acknowledge, with the reservation set forth at that time, only such control of Egyptian affairs as has been set forth in the notice(s of ?) the British Government transmitted to the Department on 18th December 1914, a copy of which is enclosed.
&quot;It is assumed that it is the purpose of Great Britain to carry out the assurances hy King George the Fifth of England to the late Sultan of Egypt as published in &quot;London Times, 21st December 1914.&quot;Lord Grey stated that the Irish Bureau, who were working with the Egyptians, had given this information to the Press. However, only one prominent New York paper had published it, but gave the headline &quot;Egypt not British is the position of the United States.&quot; The attention of the Assistant Secretary of State had been drawn to this and to the probable misapprehension as to the correct sense of the letter which would arise in the mind of the Egyptian public. The consequent serious effect it might have against the success of Lord milner&apos;s Mission had also been pointed out. The Assistant Secretary of State did not admit that exception could be taken to anything in the substance of the letter, which was an ordinary routine reply to a question. He undertook, however, to endeavour to remove any misapprehension which might arise by means of a telegram to Cairo.Referring to the above, a telegram [No. 2259] was sent hy the Foreign Office to Lord Grey on 24th December, commenting on tlie apparent inconsistency of the letter quoted with the terms of recognition. The publication of the letter while affairs in Egypt were in their present state had produced a painful impression on His Majesty&apos;s Government. It was hoped that telegraphic instructions would be sent immediately to the American representative in Cairo to remove all doubt as to the recognition being otherwise than definite.In reply to the foregoing message, Lord Grey telegraphed [No. 1715] on 30th December that the American representative in Egypt had been instructed by telegraph that if any unfortunate situation should arise from the publication in Egypt of the letter in question, he was to refer forthwith to the State Department for instructions.PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.The following reports have been received : Peace Conference.
