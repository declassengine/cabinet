FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Friction on the Herat Frontier.-On 17tli March the Viceroy of India reported [No. 3661] that, according to information received from Meshed, the friction on the Herat frontier continued and that the Governor had had a stormy interview with the Bolshevik representative. News had been received from Kabul of the issue of orders for the collection of transport camels, it being, rumoured that they were required for a force about to proceed to Herat,ARABIA.Activities of Ibn saud-On 12th March Lord Allenby telegraphed that he had been informed by King Hussein that four days previously Ibn Saud&apos;s forces had burnt two villages in Wadi Kuleikh and killed some of the&apos; inhabitants. Wadi Kuleikh is 20 miles south-east of Taif, and Ibn Saud&apos;s men were dispersed by Hejaz troops from the latter place. Colonel Vickery had reported that among the attacking forces were Wahabis from Nejd, and that they were instigated by Khalid, if indeed they were not led by him. King Hussein asked that such acts should be stopped and the representatives of Ibn Saud expelled from the Khurma and Tarabah districts within a month, as after that period he would bear no responsibility.Lord Allenby7 added that great bitterness of feeling had been excited in Hejaz, though it was not clear that the attack had been anything more than an ordinary tribal raid.The Dutch Doctor [F.C.R., xii., p. 2]. On 8th March Lord Allenby acknowledged [No. 221] the receipt of Lord Curzon&apos;s telegram of 5th March, and said that he proposed to tell the Dutch Consul-General that the doctor should obtain King Hussein&apos;s permission before going to Jeddah. He pointed out, too, that this doctor would be in Hejaz for some months without being subject to any control, as the chief of the British quarantine service only took up his duties shortly before the pilgrimage.AUSTRIA.Position in regard to Food and Coal.  On 15th March Mr. Lindley reported [No. 145] that the State Chancellor had called a meeting that afternoon of the representatives of the five Great Powers, to lay before them the critical ]30sition of Austria in regard to food and coal. He had handed to them a memorandum setting forth the food position and terminating with a request that (1) a supply of grain and fats sufficient to cover the requirements of several weeks should be shipped to Trieste at once ; and (2) the grant of credits for the supply of foodstuffs and raw materials should lieexpedited.Tyrol and Union with Germany.- On l&amp;th March the following telegram [No. 150] was received from Mr. Lindley : -The Provincial Government and the Diet of Tyrol have passed a resolution calling on the Vienna Government to demand from the Allies the withdrawal of their prohibition against union with Germany, and to threaten that all elected representa-tives of the people in Austria will retire unless ihe demand is conceded. The resolution is to be communicated to all other provincial Governments who will be invited to adhere to it,THE BALTIC STATES.The Proposed Negotiations with the Bolshcvilis. In a telegram sent from Riga on 18th March- Colonel Tallents said that the Lettish Government had asked him to transmit an official statement, the substance of which was as follows : The Lettish Government, in order that successful and advantageous results may he obtained from the proposed peace negotiations with the Bolsheviks, consider it
absolutely essential &quot; that the negotiations should be conducted in agreement with the League of Nations and in one of the Allied capitals.The Warsaw Meeting [F.O.R., xii., p. 3J-On 18th March Colonel Tallents telegraphed [No. 113] that the Lettish Minister for Foreign Affairs had reported to him as follows on the results of the visits of the Lettish Delegates to Warsaw : The Delegation was sent on the understanding that a joint conference would be&apos; held. They were disconcerted by the Poles insisting on separate meetings at each of which Mr. Patek presided. Even outside the official meetings the visiting Delegations were largely isolated from each other. The Letts were told by Mr. Patek that Poland, stood for the frontier of 1772 without any qualification, except as regards Courland and Latgalen,&quot; and regarded the status of Lithuania, White Russia and Ukraina as a purely internal Polish question. They first asked the Letts to support this view. When the Letts refused, they asked for a declaration that (? Lettlancl) was &quot;not interested&quot; in it. The Delegates could not concur and the Lettish Cabinet on 18th March decided not to give the desired declaration. Their representative had no formal intercourse with the Finns, but their military representatives inferred from a conversation with the Finnish Military Delegates that Finland had given such a declaration in return for Polish support in her claims on Karelia. The Polish representatives at Warsaw said openly that they were aware of the intense hostility their present claim would excite amongst all their neighbours,: hut were confident of the rapid Polonization of (group omitted)ed population. The Lettish Government understand that Poland will immediately enter into negotiations with the Bolsheviks at Orsha, where pourparlers are reported to be already proceeding, and will seek to conclude promptly a full peace. The Letts still desire that the Polish question should be handled by the League of Nations ; but, seeing at least inevitable delay in securing this, propose themselves to start negotiations with the Bolsheviks immediately, probably at Pskoff or Petrograd. In view especially of the Polish attitude, they cannot negotiate jointly with Lithuania, but hope Lithuania will negotiate immediately in close but informal touch with themselves. The Lithuanian representative at Riga told me on 19th March that the Bolsheviks had pressed their delegates to negotiate immediately at RevaL but the Lithuanians had replied to this that they desired the negotiations to be in London. They are likely to delay for at least a month; partly because their front does not touch the Bolshevik, X^artly because they believe that Great Britain, if not the League of Nations, must realise the injustice and danger of the present Polish claims, and take such steps as may be necessary to secure a just settlement of the present situation.Finnish Prime Minister s Declaration of Policy. Telegraphing from Helsingfors on 17th March, Lord Acton reported that in his first public declaration of policy the new Prime Minister had made the following statements in respect of the relations with Soviet Russia, the Great Powers, and Scandinavia, and also in respect of national defence : Finland was ready to do its part in the re-establishment of normal international relations and would naturally aim especially at the resumption of such relations between the Russia arising after a long continued state of confusion and the rest of the world.  specialty at the time when the final settlement between Finland and Russia takes place Finland will need all the support it can look for from the leading world Powers. They have already in many ways shown friendship aud goodwill to Finland and thus given unchallengeable evidence of their conviction that a strong. Finland is in the best interests of international society. When the peace negotiations are opened, and while they are in progress Finland ought to aim as circumstances allow at co-operation with the new States arisen from the territory of the former Psardom and also with the other States which have a common or similar interest to maintain. In view of this, Government will try to avoid hostilities between Finland and Russia and work for a lasting peace in accordance with the political vital interests of- Finland, aud its duty to its kindred across the frontier who have been living for centuries without any possibility of political life but are now with unquestionable justice: claiming complete recognition and protection. In the honest-hope that the people of Russia may soon show themselves ready to come to a true reconciliation and to resume regular international co-operation with their neighbours, the people and the Government of Finland must specially see that the internal peace mid the legal and social order of Finland are not endangered by the coming peace. Ihe friendly aud confidential relations happily formed between Finland and foreign Powers must be maintained  in  future.    Finland  must pursue an   independent-
-national policy- and aim at peaceful treaty relations with foreign Powers in the interest of international life. The Government hopes that it will soon be able to-consider the question of Finland joining the League of Nations now being formed. Ancient- legal and cultural traditions unite Finland with the Scandinavian countries, especially Sweden. Finland must, as far as it can, take part in the future also in the growing co-operation between the northern countries in the various intellectual and economic spheres. The care of national defence is one of the chief duties of the republic, especially so long as the international situation is doubtful and unstable, but, as conditions allow, Finland must aim at the lightening of the military burden. The defence corps based on the spontaneous interest of the people and working uncler Government supervision is an important factor in Finnish defence organization.Latvia and Esthonia.-Qn 21st March a telegram [No. 289] was received from-Lord Acton intimating that he had been informed by the Latvian Minister in Helsingfors that a communique had been issued at Riga that the Latvian Government had no desire to resume warlike operations against Esthonia, but hoped that the frontier questions would be satisfactorily settled by the forthcoming Riga conference.It was added that at the Warsaw Conference Latvia had reached an agreement with Poland on the subject of peace negotiations with Soviet Russia.Poland and Lithuania. On 21st March Lord Curzon informed [No. 371] Lord -Derby that serious reports had reached him of an impending conflict between the Poles and the Lithuanians. In view of the critical nature of the situation reported in a telegram from Kovno he had that clay telegraphed to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Warsaw instructing him, if the situation was as serious as was reported by Colonel Ward, to warn the. Polish Government at once of the concern which would be felt by His Majesty&apos;s Government at the opening of hostilities between Poland and Lithuania, leaving it to Sir H. Rumbolcbs discretion to add that His Majesty&apos;s Government would strongly disapprove of any further Polish advance into Lithuanian territory. Lord Curzon then instructed Lord Derby to bring the matter before the Ambassadors&apos; Council at once, and to urge that the Polish Government should be warned without delay that the Allies would not tolerate any aggressive action against Lithuania.On 22nd March a telegram [No. 186] was received from Sir Horace Rumbold, reporting that the version of the facts given in Warsaw was that the Lithuanians had taken a village on territory occupied by Polish troops, who had in consequence occupied three villages on Lithuanian territory. He proposed, before taking action, to await the report of a mixed Commission, which he understood had left Kovno to investigate the facts.THE CAUCASUS.The Batnm Zone. Mr. Wardrop Avas informed by telegram [No. 135] from the Foreign Office on 21st March that the frontiers of the proposed Datum zone had not yet been defined, and consequently no settlement as to what would remain in the province had been arrived at. The creation of a free port would necessitate the provision of access to it by road and railway for others in addition to the Georgians. The reported advance of the Georgians into the Datum was, in the circumstances, an ill-judged proceeding, and a staff officer had been sent to Tiflis to demand their withdrawal. Such attempts on the part of Caucasian States to prejudice the ultimate decisions-of the Conference could only result in the alienation of British sympathies. ..Mr. Wardrop was instructed to convey an immediate warning to the offending States.-&apos;. - CENTRAL AMERICA.Guatemala.The Political Situation. On 15th March Mr. Armstrong telegraphed [No. 22] as follows : The political situation seems to be almost hopeless, as neither side appears -willing to yield. In order to avoid immediate bloodshed, the Spanish representative, the United States Minister and myself have, at the request of both sides, lent our o &apos; od offices with a view of finding a peaceful solution- .Honduras. .    . .;     :      .   .     . ,  ...     ... \ .      , .Border Raid by Nicaraguans.--Mr. Armstrong reported [No. 23] from Guatemala on 16th March that a raid by malcontents was made on 19th February from Nicaragua
on Honduras provincial towns in (? Dauli) on the Nicaraguan border.   The Govern-... rnent of Honduras despatched troops to the spot who drove off the marauders without fighting.Since then no disturbance had been reported. San Salvador.League of Nations. Mr. Armstrong telegraphed [No. 19] on 11th March that the Government of San Salvador had on 5th March decreed its adherence to the League of Nations Covenant.GERMANY.Disturbances and Credits. Telegraphing on 20th March [No. 155] Lord Kilmarnock stated that at an interview he had had with the Vice-Chancellor he had stated that in his opinion there would be no possibility of food, raw material, or credits being allowed to Germany unless a constitutional regime were upheld, and that all such assistance would be out of the question if order were further disturbed from any quarter. He had authorized the Vice-Chancellor to publish this declaration, and the latter had thanked him cordially, saying that it would have a most salutary effect on the Extremists. He had also spoken strongby in the same sense to one of the most moderate of the Independent leaders, who had promised to repeat his remarks to his comrades ; from what he had said it was evident that in his own opinion it was touch and go whether Berlin would turn Communist or not.The Bhineland. According to a telegram [No. 56] sent by Sir H. Stewart from Coblentz, a meeting of representatives of the various political parties in the British zone was held at Cologne on 18th March. In the event of Germany being in a state of complete chaos, it was resolved that the Rhineland should proclaim itself a State in a German federation, and not allow itself to be taken over by France, it being feared that if the disturbances should continue France would attempt this. The party leaders were instructed to report to the Oberburgomeister of Cologne, who was entrusted with the drawing up of the plan for the formation of such a State. On account of its mines, which are. necessary for the industries of the Rhinelancl, an effort will be made to include Westphalia, but it is doubtful whether the latter will consent.JAPAN.The Diet. On 15th March Mi&apos;. Alston telegraphed [No. 90] from Tokio as follows : The Diet was dissolved on 26th February on the ground that the measures for the further extensions of the franchise presented to Parliament by the opposition parties would, if passed, amount in effect to the adoption of universal manhood suffrage, for which the country was not yet ready and which it did not unanimously demand. Parliament, therefore, though in favour of a gradual extension of the franchise, was obliged to submit the issue to the impartial judgment of the nation at a general election which would be held under the extended franchise passed during the last session of the Diet.Although the foregoing are ostensible and partial grounds for the dissolution, there is no doubt that reasons of party strategy were the deciding factor.MEXICO.The Presidential Election. Mr. Cummins telegraphed [No. 18] on 22nd March that Bonillas was greeted on his arrival in Mexico City with imposing manifestations prepared by officials of the&apos;Government who indicated their intention to make him President. Some small conflicts took place with the supporters of Obregon, but Mr. Cummins has been&apos; assured that ObregoiPs influence amounts to nothing now. His party declare, however, that they will not submit to the administration^ proposed imposition, and that Obregon will have the support of a considerable portion of the arm v.PERSIA.The Bolsheviks. On 11th March Sir Percy Cox notified [No. 120] the receipt by the Prime Minister of the report of a trustworthy spy who had been sent among the Turcomans camped to the east of Asterabacl. This spy stated that the Bolsheviks contemplated using a place called Karasu (on the coast between Hassan Duli and Bandar Bey) for the landing of a force whose object would be to rouse the Turcos and 13-4 B
prepare the way for an advance to the Afghan frontier, and that they already had the nucleus of such a force at that place.Sir Percy also notified the receipt by the Persian Government of reports from the Governor-General of Khorassan in regard to Bolshevik intentions with reference to Gumbacl Kabus ; which reports were to much the same effect as those sent by General Malleson. &quot;POLAND,Relations with the Russian Sovieti-On 14th March. Sir Horace Rumbold tele-graphed [No. 167] the following summary of a note which had been handed to him and bis three principal allied colleagues for communication to their respective Govern-ments : -The note begins by stating that the Polish Government has decided to act on the peace overtures of the Soviet Government and to open negotiations for peace towards the end of the present month. The Polish. Government lays down the following conditions of principle : Russia must efface the consequences of the historic crime of which Poland was the victim (group undecipherable) Russia took part in the partition of the Republic, and any trace of this iniquity would render impossible the establishment of relations between Poland and Russia based on mutual and sincere goodwill.. Russia must renounce all territorial rights proceeding from acts of violence-committed against the Polish Republic since 1772, and annul ail the conse-quences of partitions of Poland. Russia must recognize the independence of all the States which have been formed out of the Russian Km pi re, and which at the present moment have already de facto Governments, and must undertake, not to exercise any influence on their internal organization, leaving them at full liberty to decide their form of government, as well as to determine, in accordance with their free expression and will, the.relations which they desire to see established with other States.The Soviet Government undertakes to renounce from now onward all pro-paganda in favour of its social and political theories of the frontiers of the Soviet State, such, propaganda constituting an activity contrary to the principles of non-interference with the affairs of other States.Russia binds herself to submit to the Treaty of Peace concluded with Poland, and to ratify it by the highest representative body representing the will, of the Russian people. .Russia undertakes to return to the Polish Republic all properties and possessions belonging to the former Russian Empire, and to the ex-Imperial Russian family, which are situated in Polish territories within the limits of the frontiers of 1772 ; to pay to the Polish Republic the portion of assets of the Russian State Bank based on calculations made on 1st August 1914 ; to restore to the Polish Government and to persons domiciled in the territories of the Polish Republic within the limits of the frontiers of 1772, as well as to subjects of the Polish Government within the limits of the former Russian Empire, the archives of museums, historical souvenirs and works of art, as well as securities, money and other objects ; to pay indemnities for all destructions, requisitions and con-fiscations which have taken place in the course of the war of 1914, and during the revolution of 1917 ; to guarantee the indemnities should expropriation and seizure of property be decreed on the territory of the Russian State; and finally, duly to guarantee the execution of the Treaty of Peace.In the case of acceptance by Russia of this basis of negotiations, the Polish Government is ready immediately to commence discussion of the details of these peace negotiations in so far as regards the political, economic, financial and Miilitary conditions laid down in conformity with a plan which has been elaborately drawn up.In so far as she is concerned, Poland, faithful to her principles of tolerance and liberty, as well as imbued with respect for the national rights of peoples, declares she will determine the destiny of the populations inhabiting the regions of the East comprised within the frontiers of 1772, in conformity with their wishes.In communicating the foregoing, the Minister for Foreign Affairs told me he had acquainted the representatives of the border States now at Warsaw, with the substance of this note, but had only given the (?formal) note to my three principal allied colleagues and myself.
tRUSSIA. -   ;M. Maximoff&apos;s Report on Soviet Russia. On loth: March Sir H. Rumbold despatched the following telegram [No. 173] from Warsaw The following is a summarv of the first portion-of a report made by M. Maximo ff, who recently escaped from Soviet Russia, Especial interest and weight attach to M. Maximoffs state-ments as, being a man of education and attainments, he was impressed&quot; compulsorily into the service of the Soviet Government, and occupied the post of Technical Counsellor to the Superior Economic Council; he has -thus seen the Bolshevik administration from the inside and his report deals with matters which directly concerned his Council : The process of destruction continues in all branches of industry and labour. The general loss of productive power is due to the following main causes : all stimulus to individual work has been removed ; no wage covers the cost of living ; chronic underfeeding and disease ; absence of personal safety; appointment of uncpialified persons to responsible administrative posts; conscious and unconscious sabotage of the Soviet Government by the whole, population ; immobilization for purposes of productive work of three and a half million men engaged on military operations ; continual changes in Government and laws.Industrial workers are reduced to the- position of serfs, and are under the equivalent of prison discipline in the factories, to leave which is punishable as desertion. Many workmen nevertheless desert, and as fuel, lubricants, spare parts and raw material are lacking, the output of works cannot conceivably exceed 10 per cent, of the pre-revolution output, notwithstanding more optimistic official Soviet figures. In many cases it is almost impossible even to keep factories going, as workmen barter away pieces of machinery, &amp;c, for food.The transport situation is equally desperate, despite the efforts of the Government. Only 15 per cent, of the locomotives sent to workshops get repaired ; on an average to repair one engine seven other engines have to be taken down. The number of engines built is barely 5 per cent, of the pre-revo-lution production ; new trucks are very few. No steel or ferro-alloys are available, brakes, lighting and heating apj)aratus are all damaged. The process of destruction is so rapid that probably before the end of 1920 railway traffic will, in the opinion of the technical experts, have to cease altogether. This opinion is not of course published in the Press. The former representative in Russia of Siemens-Shuckert considers that in most favour-able conditions railway traffic cannot be normal before 1928, assuming a partial resumption of the metallurgical industry in 1927, and extensive foreign help. Some members of the Soviet Government share but conceal this view. Engineers are less optimistic owing to the widespread destruction of rolling-stock, shops, plant, &amp;c, and consider the investment of 3,000,000,000 roubles gold necessary for the partial re-establishment of traffic.The so-called &quot; AVorkmen^ Army&quot; has proved useless for rebuilding railways. River transport is down to 3 per cent, ; waterways, harbours, &amp;c, are ail let down and require 1,500,000,000 gold roubles to restore them. No ships are building. Horse transport has practically disappeared, e.g., in Moscow the number of horses has sunk since 1911 from 136,000 to 8,000.There is hopeless decay in other branches of industry ; e.g., at the end of 1919 there was one blast furnace and not a single rolling mill working in the whole country ; jez Soviet officials talk of a trust of works to compete with the United States of America.; the Ural industrial district is ruined ; the Petrograd industrial district has actually ceased to exist, -that of Moscow practically. The output even of military factories is only 10 per cent, of the pre-re volution output.Business is on the following lines : orders are only accepted if approved by the administration, the management and the workmen ; no guarantee as to time of delivery ; the buyer must supply the materials, and goods are manufactured at his risk. The country is still living on previous stocks, which will be exhausted in three or four months.There is no fuel, as only one-eighteenth of the quantities estimated as the irreducible minimum was prepared.The state of agriculture is lamentable ; there are practically7 no horses and no mechanical transport ; only 50 per cent, of the pre-war area is under cultivation^ and seeds and plants are insufficient even for that; there are no manures. 13-4 C
sSiberia. - .Protest by M. Chieherin against the Japanese. Telegraphing [No. 47] from Reval on 12th March, Mr. Porter transmitted the following message from M. Chicherin to Lord Curzon :-Le. gouvernement sovietiste russe attire . 1&apos;attention des Puissances Alliees et Associees.&quot;sur la iiouvello agression injustifiee, clout la Russie eat victime de la part xlu. gouy erne men t Japonais qui vient de diriger une expedition- navale contre la partie septentrionale (word mutilated) de violence commise a 1&apos;egard du territbire de la Republique, et indique- aux Gouvernements Allies et Associes les consequences fuiiost.es qui se suivront pour les interets vitaux de ces Puissances eRes-mem.es.

In a note, now received the Swiss Government state that they are very disposed to take part in this humanitarian work. They have appointed as their delegate at the Paris Conference Monsieur de Haller, Director-General of the National Bank, who is already in. touch with, the British and American delegates.SYRIA.The Syrian Congress. On 13th March Lord Curzon instructed Lord Allenby [No. 223] to inform Emir Eeisal that His Majesty&apos;s Government coo Id not allow the future of Syria, Palestine, Mosul, and Mesopotamia to be settled by the Syrian Congress of whose authority or composition they were ignorant. The future of those countries could only be determined by the Allied Powers, acting in concert, hy whose armies they had been conquered from the Turks.On 21st March Mr. Wratislaw telegraphed from Beirut [No. 32] transmitting a summary of the iDrotest of the Administrative Council of the Lebanon : It declares that the Syrian Congress has no competence to discuss the affairs of the independent Lebanon or to interfere in its affairs ; protests, against the statements in the Damascus proclamation regarding the Lebanon; confirms the absolute independence of the Lebanon as defined on 20th May 1911) in its natural and historical limits with the assistance of France ; and begs that its protest maybe communicated to the Peace Conference to which the maintenance of the rights of the Lebanon are confided.Message from Emir FeisaVs Ministry for Foreign Affairs. - On 14th March Lord Allenby informed [No. E.A. 3023] Lord Curzon that he had received a despatch for transmission to him from Emir FeisaFs Ministry for Foreign Affairs announcing that; the Arab people, fearing for their future existence and their national unity, had decided to proclaim the absolute independence of Syria, and to place Emir Feisal upon her throne. The new Government intended to maintain that independence; to maintain good relations with foreign Powers, especially with Great Britain and France, whose traditional friendship and economic interests were recognized; to co-operate loyally with the Allies in. maintaining peace throughout the East; to reorganize and develop the country and its resources ; and to assure public order, religious freedom, justice and the rights of minorities.General Gouraud&apos;s: Attitude. - - Telegraphing on 18th March [No. 265], Lord Allenby informed Lord Curzon that in reply to a telegram from himself, General Gouraud had stated that, until he had contrary orders from Paris, he intended to avoid any show of hostility to Emir. Feisal so long as he made no attempt to act on the declaration of,the Syrian.Congress in regard to the retirement.of: the military adminis-i rations in Mesopotamia and in the western and southern zones.
lord allenby,&apos;s Opinion in regard to the Situation.- On 18th March Lord Allen by telegraphed [No. 271] his opinion that war must ensue if the Powers persisted in their attitude in regard to the Syrian Congress, and that if hostilities should arise we should be/dragged by. the French into a war which was against our own interests. He -strongly advised the acknowledgment of Feisabs sovereignty over an Arab nation or confederation embracing Mesopotamia, Palestine and Syria, the administration of the last named being secured to the French, and that of the other two to us. This arrange-ment wordd, he thought, be accepted by Emir Feisal, and the Arabs would be our friends, whilst he could not see how we could be the losers by it.Protest of Jerusalem Syrians. -On 12th March Colonel MeinertzhagCn reported [No. 25] that a protest had been submitted to the representatives of the United States, France, and Italy, as well as to the Military Governor of Jerusalem, demanding that Syria should be independent, and that Palestine should not be separated from it, and further that there should be no Jewish immigration and no Zionism. These were considered to be inherited rights, and they not only refused to accept any settlement which would be in derogation of those rights, but were ready to defend their position to the&apos; very end.A Syrian General on recent Events. -On 20th March Admiral de Robeck telegraphed [No. 257] an account of the situation given by General Nowri-el-Said, a member of Emir Feisabs staff.General Nowri stated that a large number of the Aneizeh tribe had joined the Turkish nationalists; that the latter were dissatisfied with the French, owing to tactless administration by inexperienced French officials, and were determined to drive them out. The Arab Government, too, was with difficulty restraining all the Bedouins in the Aleppo district from taking- part against the French, who in the course of their operations had burnt 23 villages in that district; at the end of last month or the beginning of this the Ausarieh had surrounded and blockaded a French force in the Latakieh district. The Druses, too, in the country inland from Beirut to Haifa were attacking small parties of French troops and European travellers.Speaking of Marash, General Nowri stated that the French had mishandled the situation, and interfered unduly in local administration. The Armenian legion, too, had been allowed to take punitive action against certain villages, and had thereby aroused Turkish hostility.He also said that in Cilicia there was a risk of the Arabs as a whole joining the Turks in operations against the French, and that it was for the purpose of diverting, attention that Emir Feisal had convoked the Syrian Congress.TURKESTAN.General Kuropatkin [F.C.R., xii., p. 9]. The Viceroy of India telegraphed [No. 3584] on 17th March that General Malleson had reported that after prolonged enquiries it might be accepted that General Kuropatkin was not in Turkestan, as had been so persistently announced, but was in Moscow. It was supposed that General Novitsky had been mistaken for General Kuropatkin. No definite result had attended the enquiries about General Brusiloff, which were being continued.TURKEY.Provisional Occupation of Constantinople. The following telegram [No. 262] from Admiral de Robeck, dated 21st March, gives the exact English translation of the French text of the proclamation issued by the High Commissioners on the occupation of Constantinople: Five and a half years ago the leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress, who-had got into their hands the destinies of Turkey, allowed Germany to impose her will upon them, and caused Turkey to participate in the general war. The results of this ill-omened policy7 are known. The Turkish Government and people, after a thousand disasters of every kind, suffered such a defeat that the leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress saw no solution but to conclude an armistice and take to flight on the conclusion of the armistice. A heavy task devolved on the Entente Powers. This task was to lay the foundations of a peace which would ensure the future happiness anddevelopment of social and economical life of all the peoples inhabiting the former Ottoman Empire, without-distinction of race or creed.   &quot;While the Peace Conference was engaged in the
- performance of this task, certain persons representing the ideas of the fugitive &apos; leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress organized a so-called national organization which, taking no account of the orders of-the Sultan or of the Government, forcibly recruits men already exhausted by the Avar, extorts from the population forced contributions for its own ends, and multiplying the causes of dissension everywhere, seems to wish&apos; to open a new era of hostilities. The Conference pursued . none the less its work of pacification; it adopted the tranquillizing (in Turkish sic) comforting to Ottoman hearts decision to maintaiu Constantinople under Turkish administration, but on condition, as the Sublime Porte Avas. warned, that the Christians in the provinces should no longer be exposed to danger, and that all attacks against the.forces of the Entente and their Allies should cease immediately. The adherents of the alleged national organization, however, far from seconding in this matter the goodwill of the Central Government, sought on the contrary to hamper it (in Turkish sic). Although the Central Government, confronted with this warning, showed good-will up to a certain extent, the persons working under the assumed name of national organization, were unfortunately umvilling to abandon their agitation.. On the contrary, they-sought to make the Government participate in their own movement, This situation, so prejudicial to the conclusion&quot; of the longed-for peace, compelled the Entente Powers to consider the measures necessary for ensuring the execution of the peace terms to be decided on in the near future. There was but one means, namely, the provisional occupation of Constantinople. As this measure is now being put into effect the following points are brought to the knowledge of all: (1) The occupation is provisional.(2) The Entente Powers do not intend to destroy7 the authority of the Sultanate ; they Avish, on the contrary-, to strengthen that authority7 in all jdaces which will remain under Turkish administration.(3j The Entente PoAvers maintain their intention of not depriving the Turks of Constantinople ; but if, God forbid, Avidespread disturbances or massacres should occur, this decision would probably7 be altered.(1) At this critical time it is the duty of everyone to go about his ordinary business, to contribute thereby7 to the maintenance of public security, and not to be led astray by those whose misguided conduct tends to destroy the last hope of building a new Turkey on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. In a word, it is the duty of everyone to obey the orders issuing from the Sultanate (in Turkish sic) from Gonstanti-nople, still the seat of the Sultanate.(5) Certain persons, concerned in the incitement mentioned above, have been arrested in Constantinople ; they will naturally- have to answer for their acts and for such future consequences as may7 result from ,those acts.Telegraphing [No. 263] on the same date, Admiral de Robeck reported that the proclamation had had an excellent effect in Constantinople. Although its general publication in the provinces was unlikely, it would reach the hands of the Nationalist leaders and their associations. It was thought that it would lead to the division of their Councils, and that the warning that the concession made to the Turks regarding - Constantinople might be withdrawn, should massacres occur, would emphasize the necessity for respecting the lives of Christians.UNITED STATES  OK AMERICA.The Peace Treaty. By a telegram [No. 218] of 20th March Mr. Lindsay sent the following report :- After disposing of the preamble and thus completing a resolution of ratification, the Senate proceeded to vote on the resolution as a whole. It- secured 49 votes against 35, and having thus failed to obtain a two-thirds majority, ratification was refused. Thereupon another resolution w^as passed by 47 to 37 to inform the President of the above decision. An effort AA7as then made to have the A-ote on the resolution of ratification reconsidered, and a very7 confused Parliamentary situation arose, in the midst of which the Senate adjourned. It must not, however, be supposed that this attempt to bring the Treaty up again before the Senate, even if it succeeds, will have any important result. The Treaty is dead so far as the Senate is.Concerned, and it is difficult to see how it can possibly be brought to life again.
