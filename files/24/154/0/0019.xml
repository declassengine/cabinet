FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.The Situation in regard to the Bolsheviks. On 8th June the Aueeroy of India reported as follows in regard to the Bolshevik Afghan situation [No. 706 S.j : The Bolshevik power of offence was, he said, limited, and their position in Trans-Caspia insecure without the help of the Afghans ; and at the same time experience was teaching them that no reliance could he placed on the xAfghans. The latter on their part realised that it would be wise to come to terms with us, unless they could obtain certain and active help from the Bolsheviks.The Bolsheviks were very anxious in regard to their position in Khiva, Bokhara, and Fergana, and also as to Afghanistan helping Bokhara against them. It had been made plain to them that promises would not secure Afghan help : money and arms were necessary, which, the Bolsheviks feared, once obtained would be used for the amir&apos;s own purposes. Bokhara was inclined to look for help against the Bolsheviks to  he Indian Government, which would not give it through the medium of the Afghans ; it was in fact entirely opposed to attempting any entente with Afghanistan.ALBANIA.Valona. On 10th June Sir George Buchanan telegraphed [No. 236] that he had heard on good authority that sailors from the fleet had replaced the crews of ships chartered to convey troops from Taranto to A7alona as the latter had refused to serve. In regard to Valona the Foreign Minister had informed him that yet more reinforcements would be sent, but he did not believe that there was serious danger, as they had had rather better news ; he had no information, however, as to the state of the interior.ARABIA.Message for King Hussein. -The following message to King Hussein from Lord Curzon was telegraphed [No. 540] to Lord Allenby on 15th June : I have received your Maj esty&apos;s telegrams of 23rd May and 30th May. As your Majesty is aware, the Peace Conference has recognized the principle of independence for the Arab countries freed from the domination of the Turks, and has conferred the mandate for Palestine upon His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that for Syria upon France, to enable them to receive the help necessitated by the exhaustion and the disturbed conditions following upon the war ; your Majesty is also aware that the Hejaz, a member of the League of Nations, is to be entirely independent.With regard to the invitation to the Emir Feisal to proceed to Europe, this invitation was issued by the Peace Conference, and not by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and I am, therefore, not competent to answer y-our Majesty about it. There is no question of His Majesty s Government departing from the obligations into which it has entered, or from the attitude of friendly co-operation which has hitherto characterized the relations between your Majesty and His Maj esty&apos;s Government.ARGENTINA.Wheat Export Bill. In a series of: telegrams [Nos. 119 et seg.] from Buenos Aires-Mr. Macleay has recorded the introduction by the Government of a Bill dealing with the subject of the export of wheat, and wheat-flour with the taxation and fiscal regulations pertaining thereto, and the amendments which it has. undergone during consideration in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The Bill provides for a surtax on wheat and wheat flour at four dollars per hundred kilogrammes, which the Chamber of Deputies voted should be increased to five dollars. Pending the consideration by the Senate,of this and other amendments, the loading of vessels was
o-suspended, notwithstanding the admitted existence of  an exportable surplus of 1,200,000 tons, the obvious reason of this suspension being to&apos;anticipate the effects of -the Bill and to make all unshipped wheat liable to the proposed surtax.   In response to Mr. Macleay&apos;s protests as to the serious effects on our shipping arrangements, -especially on vessels then loading, the Minister for Foreign Affairs offered to make some concession by allowing a limited quantity of wheat to be shipped at once, before the Bill became law, and therefore free of duty.   Mr. Macleay proposed to accept what he could of concessions of this nature subject to any action which might be decided on by His Majesty&apos;s Government.   The point for decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government was, he thought, whether immediate requirements warranted the payment -of so high a tax on wheat already purchased but not yet shipped, or whether it would not be better to leave it stored where it was, hy way of admonition to the Argentine Government..  Mr. Macleay pointed out that the law might have a disastrous effect on some of the British foreign wheat firms in the Argentine who had made private sales on a c.i.f. basis.On 10th June Mr. Macleay sent the following telegram. [No. 125] : The Senate has passed the Bill as amended by the Chamber and it will become law as soon as promulgated.The Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed me last night that the Argentine Government had agreed to allow six out of a list submitted by me of nine vessels chartered hy the Wheat Commission, whose loading operations had been suspended, in virtue of a hitherto unpublished decree, since 2nd June, and which for various reasons had previously incurred demurrage, immediately to resume loading wheat, and to complete their cargoes without the latter being made subject to export surtax. The amount of wheat which will thus escape additional tax is 13,900 tons.I impressed on the Minister for Foreign Affairs that I only accepted this so-called concession ou the distinct understanding that it did not prejudice any claim which His Majesty^s Government might make in respect of the suspension of the loading of vessels, chartered by the Commission and British subjects, which had arrived in Argentine ports, and had received the necessary permission to load cargoes of wheat already sold to the Commission, or private individuals, under the existing tariff law.In view of the fact that the decree on which the order of suspension was based has not been published in the official gazette, and that I have been unable to procure a copy on application to the Ministry of Finance, it would appear to be a matter for consideration whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be entitled to claim exemption from surtax of all wheat which would have been loaded on vessels awaiting cargo, from 2nd June until the date of promulgation of the law, had not loading operations been arbitrarily suspended. As it is, all wheat not shipped on 2nd June, and now exported, will be subject to the surtax, except the 13,900 tons above mentioned.The French Minister has been given a concession on similar lines, and some ships loading flour for Brazil were allowed to complete their cargoes on the deposit of the amount of the surtax.As the amount of wheat already bought on behalf of various Governments exceeds the exportable surplus of 1,200,000 tons, it is to be anticipated that the Argentine Government will have to make a pro ratd distribution amongst the various Governments interested, and presumably give them preference over private purchasers.Referring to the foregoing telegram, Mr. Macleay on 12th June reported [No. 126] - as follows : I have consulted the well-known jurist Sehor Montes de Oca, who expressed the-opinion that the decree temporarily suspending on 2nd June the loading of wheat ships is based on Article 7 of the law of .19th January 1918, which says : &quot;The executive is empowered to suspend (provisionally ?) the export of specified articles whether of national production or imported, when reasons of an internal nature so require,, with the obligation to submit for the approval of Congress whatever measures may have been adopted.&quot;This law, which was original^ framed to expire on. 31st December 1918, was -subsequently (group undecypherable) hy successive budget laws, and on the last occasion of the propagation was extended to 31st May last. Sehor Montes de Oca&apos;s opinion, therefore, is that the decree of 2nd June is illegal and invalid, being based on a law which was not in force when it was issued, although the law just passed provides that the 1918 law is to continue in effect to 31st December next.    He
explained that this was his first impression, that he was going fully into the subject, and would give me a considered opinion on Monday.The Wheat Commission informs me that the legal advisers of several large-wheat firms here have pronounced the decree of 2nd June to be illegal.Senor Montes de Oca told me that so far as the new law itself was concerned, he-clid not think that we should be able to contest its validity on constitutional grounds.AUSTRIA.Government Crisis. On 11th June Mr. Lindley reported [No. 259] as follows: In the National Assembly last night the Pan-German leader attacked the-Democratic Secretary of State for War for having issued certain regulations for the new soldiers&apos; councils without submitting them to the Cabinet. The leader of the * Christian Socialists joined in the attack and described the Secretary of Slate&apos;s action as illegal. The attack and the answer ol the Secretary of State appear to have been reasonably moderate, but subsequent speeches developed such heat that the latent hostility7 between the two groups broke out openly and led to mutual insults and threats to leave the coalition.As a result, this morning&apos;s papers announced that the State Chancellor and the Social Democratic members of the Government had applied to their party leader for permission to resign, and it was taken for granted that permission, would be granted.The reasons for the resignation given in the official communique are that the negotiations between the two parties concerning the capital levy and the constitution have led to no result ; that the Christian Socialist leaders are openly organizing an army of peasants ; that they never cease to attack the Government outside Parliament; and finally, that yesterday they formed a coalition with the Pan-Germans, and made-impossible demands on the Government.I happened to meet the State Chancellor and the Secretary of State for War last night at dinner. They told me that there had been a scene in the Chamber, but they did not then think it would develop into such a crisis. The State Chancellor spoke,., however, of the possibility of resigning as it was necessary to bring the rank and file of both parties to their bearings, and show them not only that the Coalition Government was necessary, but that it could not exist unless mutual forbearance was shown. I have no doubt, therefore, that the State Chancellor regards the resignation of the Cabinet- as a tactical move, and hopes to form a second coalition on a firmer basis.The question is whether he will succeed. The?e was a most unfortunate incident at Gratz two days ago. which began in the morning by a female demonstration against the high price of cherries, and ended at night by the gendarmerie shooting on an unruly mob, killing 14 and wounding over 20. As a result of this, all the Social Democrats have left the Provincial Government of Styria and the Town Council of Gratz, There was an anti-Jewish demonstration in Vienna on Sunday which most fortunately7 ended quietly7. There is no doubt that the peasants, who have all. along had arms, are now being organized into regular formations, both in the Tyrol -and Styria, to resist any7 attack from armed workmen, or perhaps to attack them. In-short, tne scene seems to be set rather for a civil war between town and country than for a new Coalition Government, and the Secretary of State for War spoke very7 seriously on this subject last night, and urged the disarmament of both sides by the . Allied Commission of Military ControlI have urged the desirability of this measure so often during the last six months that it is unnecessary7- for me to do so again.   It is now difficult of accomplishment, and the incomprehensible delay in ratifying the treaty7 has in this and in other-respects had a most deplorable effect in Austria and in all. Central Europe,Later in the day he telegraphed [No. 260] that the whole Cabinet had resigned, Tut would direct affairs pending the formation of a new Government,The general opinion was that a Coalition Government of some kind wras unavoidable, but there was a considerable number who believed that the projwsals would take the form of both parties agreeing on a programme to be carried out by a Cabinet of officials.It was hoped in this way7 to avoid personal difficulties, but doubtful whether the Social Democrats would agree to support such a Cabinet,A party of (two groups undecypherable)er had asked him what the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government would be, aud he had replied that the attitude of His-
Majesty&apos;s Government towards Austria was not influenced by tbe complexion of the Government provided that it was legally constituted, loyally carried out the&quot; Treaty, and had nothing: to do with the Hapsburgs.Telegraphing again [No. 261] on the following day, he said that the crisis remained unsolved and the&apos;Social Democratic Party bad taken up the attitude that, as the Christian Socialists and Pan-Germans had formed a new coalition, it was for them to undertake the Government. Presumably in order to show how impossible it was for these two parties to (? follow) this advice, the Social Democrats had arranged a mass meeting of soldiers at Vienna. There was some nervousness as to what might happen, but it was to be hoped that the day would pass quietly.The fact that the Social Democratic Party had called upon the newly-formed army to demonstrate in their favour, exposed the bad faith of their protests that this army was not a party guard but a national army. *On 14th June Mr. Lindley reported [No. 263] that the mass meeting of soldiers had passed off quietly; that the Government crisis remained unsolved; that the Social Democrats had refused to enter into any new coalition ; that both they and the Christian Socialists had refused to form a party Government, and that both parties professed to desire an electiou, which, however, coirld not take place before September as an election krw was required, and there seemed to be no agreement between the parties as to the legislation which the present Assembly should pass before it&apos; dissolves.BALTIC STATES.Lithuania and Poland.-On 9th June, Lord Curzon informed the British representatives at Kovno [No. 51] and Warsaw [No. 258] that on 4th June Lord Hardinge had told the Lithuanian representative that while His Majesty&apos;s Government strongly deprecated an alliance between Lithuania and the Bolsheviks, they would not feel justified in pressing the former to adopt an attitude towards Poland which might be contrary to her own interests. Count Tyszkiewicz then stated that the recognition by Poland of Lithuania&apos;s independence, and the possession of Vilna, were the absolute essentials of a satisfactory agreement. Lord Hardinge replied that we were carefully considering the question of Lithuania&apos;s independence, andi hoped that she would remain neutral and come to an arrangement with Poland on the points in dispute.Next day Lord Hardinge saw the Polish Charge d&apos; Affaires, and pointed out that while the Poles held territory claimed by the Lithuanians, the latter could hardly be expected to comply indefinitely with their request to maintain the statics quo, and it appeared to His Majesty:&apos;s Government that the moment had arrived to impress upon the Polish Government the absolute necessity of coming to terms by recognizing Lithuanian independence and agreeing to a friendly discussion of the frontier question on ethnographical principles. As to Vilna, it was undeniably the ancient Lithuanian capital.Aland Islands. On 31st May Mr. Barclay reported from Stockholm [No. 166] that the Foreign Minister had informed him that a delegation from the Aland Islands had been received by the King, and afterwards by himself, the Prime Minister, and the whole Cabinet.Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 167], he said that the petition of the Alanders briefly recapitulated the position, reiterated their determination to be united to Sweden, and announced their intention of convoking an assembly directly emanating from the people, in order to make known once, more their firm deter-mination to persevere until they had obtained their object. The King of Sweden&apos;s reply urged the Alanders not to be despondent for he had learnt from a leading politician during his visit to London and Paris that there existed a strong sentiment of (? cordiality) regarding their desire which inspired him with the hope that there would be no further postponement of the recognition of their right to self-determination.The Prime Minister replied in the same strain, and added that Sweden&apos;s unanimous public opinion would not give up its efforts on their behalf.On the same day (1st June) Mr. Barclay further reported [No. 170] that three members of the Aland deleo-ation had called on him and handed him a netition with a request that it might be transmitted to the Supreme Council. It urged that the question should be taken into consideration and settled, if possible, at the next meeting of the Supreme Council. It said that the- (? Alanders) were firmly determined not to shrink from even the most desperate steps in order to gain their purpose, 17-3 B
&quot;though they were still hoping for a peaceable solution by the (? assistance) of the-Great Powers.   Thus complications of incalculable range would be avoided.On 2nd June Mr. Kidston reported from Helsingfors [No. 489] that he had been sent for by the Prime Minister, who informed him that he was proceeding to the Aland Islands to endeavour to calm local opinion, and that he would be accompanied by the Minister of War.He said that the reports received from Finnish representatives abroad did not agree with the King of Sweden&apos;s statement that the Great Powers regarded the desires-of the islanders with benevolence. His Excellency pressed most strongly for an immediate declaration by the Great Powers of entire disinterestedness.Telegraphing again on 7th June [No. 66 (sic)] Mr. Kidston said that he had been told by the Foreign Minister that the Finnish Ministers who visited the Aland Islands-had asked ihe representatives of the islanders to meet them and had been met with a. curt refusal on the ground that they had nothing further to say as they had already laid their case before the Swedish Government and the Great Powers. Two members of the recent deputation to Sweden and other leaders had been placed under detention.&apos; An official note from the Swedish Minister asked whether the detention of the two-delegates was due to their having - appealed to the Peace Conference and the Great-Powers for the incorporation of the islands with Sweden ; the Finnish Government intended to reply that action had been taken against them on account of their attitude towards their own Government.&apos; *Mr. Kidston added that while sympathizing with the principle of self-determina-tion he thought it right to point out that the practical arguments were all in favour ol&quot; Finland. The islands undoubtedly belonged to Finland geographically, whatever their ethnographical status might be. and if the Powers intended to deal with the question at all they should be quite clear as to the difficulties which this fact wo id d cause. He had, he said, passed through the islands on his way to Helsingfors, and they cluster so thickly up to the mainland that one could swum from one to the other-right to their western extremity, whereas there was a good two hours&apos; open sea between the nearest island and Sweden.On 7th June Mr. Barclay- telegraphed from Stockholm [No. 44 (sic)] that the King of Sweden hoped that Great Britain and France would give strong counsels of moderation to the Finnish Government, for if the two delegates were dealt with too-severely there would be no answering for Swedish-public opinion and the consequences. He was much perturbed at their arrest on a charge of high treason.The day before, under instructions from his Government, the Finnish Minister-presented a note protesting against the reception of the deputation. The Foreign Minister suggested that the note should be kept secret, so as not to inflame public opinion. But when the Finnish Minister referred this suggestion to his Government they replied that they would prefer to have the note published.Telegraphing again on 8th June [No. 176], Mr. Barclay reported that the notes had been-published.The Finnish note of 3rd June entered a strong protest in that the Swedish Government had, without consideration of Finlaud&apos;s rights and interests, come forward as champions of a section of the Aland population which unjustifiably demanded separation from Finland and had given support to it. (? Finland) drew attention to the fact that it maintained with respect to Aland her sovereignty, which, has been recognized without reserve, and must therefore emphasize her repudiation of all claims incompatible therewith.The Swedish Governments reply, dated 7th June, communicated through the Swedish Minister at Helsiugfors, stated that the Swedish Government had received the Finnish note with some astonishment, as the Swedish Government maintained that ever since the time of (? reorganization) the Aland population had claimed with g-reat unanimity the right to determine their national status, and it had made clear to the Finnish Government that it considered, and &quot;still considered, this claim perfectly legitimate as based on the principle of the right of self-determination. The Swedish - Government had not failed to endeavour to obtain a solution therein by means of a plebiscite in agreement with Finland. Neither past action on Sweden&apos;s part nor the general position of the question before the Peace Conference could give the Finnish Government any valid ground for their present protest.On 8th June Lord Curzon sent a despatch [No. 173] to Mr. Barclay of which what follows is the gist : The Swedish Minister had spoken to him once more on the Aland Islands question.   The situation had been further advanced, and indeed -complicated, firstly,.
by the recent deputation from the islanders to Stockholm, where they had been received hy the King and his Government, and had directly pleaded for incorporation in Sweden; and secondly, hy the arrest hy the Finnish Government of the two leaders of the party, on the charge of high treason, after their return to the Islands. The Swedish Minister again urged that the question should he taken up without delay by the Supreme Council.He had reminded him of his conversation with the King of Sweden and himself in April last and said that he thought the Minister would do well to realize that the Supreme Council did not wish at this stage to charge itself with the settlement of any other problems than those which it was bound&apos; to take in hand ; he also renewed the opinion, which he had expressed to the King, that, if any friend of Sweden were to raise the matter at a future meeting of the Peace Conference, wherever it was held, the Conference would be much more likely to refer the matter to the League of Nations than to take any action on its own account. The question of the Aland Islands was precisely the kind of case which was intended to be referred to the League. Sweden was a member of the latter, and, if Finland was not, this circumstance was nevertheless provided for under the Covenant of the League. If, therefore, as Sweden desired a prompt solution of her difficulty with regard to the Aland Islands and indeed it was very desirable that a decision should not be much longer delayed and &quot;if the Swedish case was as overwhelmingly strong as she believed it to be, why should she not make an appeal to the League of Nations at once, and ask for an early hearing and a quick decision ? If it were said that Finland would not accept or would, not abide by a decision of the League, at least it could be pointed out in reply that, assuming the decision of the League to be unanimous, and to be supported if necessary by the Assembly of the League, the opinion, not of two or three Powers only, but of the civilized world, would be against Finland, and it would be impossible for her indefinitely to resist.Two days later he telegraphed as follows [No. 177] : The Finnish note in reply to the Swedish Governments request for information about the arrest of the Aland delegates states that these delegates, even after the autonomous law had come into force, openly expressed their intention of achieving the separation of Aland with the aid and under the protection of a foreign Power, and have thereby, as Finnish citizens, committed acts punishable by Finnish law, and will be brought to trial. The Finnish Government point out that they regard this matter as an internal concern.The Swedish Government in their reply of 9th June point out that the Aland delegates in conveying their demands, not to the Swedish Government only, have merely emphasized their appeal; that the passing of the Autonomy Law constitutes no new factor which can justify the Finnish action, and that the arrest &quot; is a challenge not merely to the population of the Aland Islands.&quot; The Swedish Government recall the fact that Finland based her own independence on self-determination and urged it in the matter of Eastern Karelia, and that the Finnish Government itself received the delegates from (? Karelia) and supported their demands before the Great Powers. The Finnish action must, therefore, have a profound and unfortunate effect on Sweden, as Swedish public opinion unanimously considers the arrest as a violation of an indefeasible rightOn 13th June the Finnish Government handed a further Note to the Swedish Minister at Helsingfors dealing with the reply of his Government: and next day Mr. Barclay telegraphed [No. 182] a. summary of it, The Finnish Government suggested that in similar circumstances the Swedish Government would have acted in the same way. They ex]3ressed the opinion that the Swedish Government must have been fully aware of the movement in the Aland Islands to confront them with a fait accompli ; and rejected the comparison with Finnish policy in Eastern Karelia. They, did not suppose that Sweden would recognize,any right in her citizens to negotiate with a foreign Power measures directed against its own authority : the Finnish Government did not recognize such a right in its citizens, and failed to understand what the Swedish Government intended by &quot;indefeasible rights.&quot; The action taken, they repeated, was perfectly legal and a domestic Finnish question only. They hailed with satisfaction the desire of the Swedish Government to preserve friendly relations, as showing that the two Governments were fundamentally in agreement.On 11th June Mr. Kidston reported [No. 497] that the Finnish Government had sent two battalions to reinforce the permanent garrison which consists of one battalion ; these reinforcements were Finnish speaking, but the original garrison were Swedish speaking.
sOn the same day Mr. Barclay telegraphed [No. 178] that this action had greatly perturbed the Swedish Government.. Two days later Mr. Kidston further reported [No. 500] that he had been informed by the Ministry7 of Foreign Affairs that only one battalion had been sent, and that it was hoped that the troops already there would be withdrawn before long.BULGARIA.Compulsory Labour Bill. On 12th June Sir Herbert Dering telegraj)hed [No. 61] saying that the Compulsory Labour Bill had, with a few amendments, passed the third reading on 29th May, and, having just received the royal assent, had been published in the Gazette of 10th June, becoming (? operative) the same day.THE CAUCASUS. -   &apos;Batum. On 11th June Lord Curzon informed [No. 537] Admiral de Robeck that Colonel Stokes was leaving immediately for Batum to negotiate an agreement hy which the province and port of Batum would, under suitable conditions, be handed over to the Georgian Government upon the conclusion of the agreement. The officer in command, after handing over the port and province, would withdraw the Allied forces. Colonel Stokes would endeavour to obtain for the republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan the right of free transit over the Caucasian railway and the free use of the port of Batum.On 13th June Lord Curzon instructed the Ambassadors at Paris [No. 689] and Rome [No. 251] to inform the French and Italian Governments respectively as to the -above arrangements.CENTRAL AMERICA.Guatemala [F.C.R., xiii., p. 4].- On 6th June Mr. Gaisford reported [No. 65] that the Government claimed to be fairly7 firm in the saddle, and that, except for certain labour unrest, the country was tranquil. Its stability would be more assured and its prospects more favourable if we were to recognize the Government as the other Central American States, Spain and France, practically7, had done. He had entered into unofficial relations with the Foreign Minister and had seen the President. They did not conceal their anxious desire for recognition by7 Great Britain, without in any way pressing for it. Mr. Gaisford added that the relations with Mexico appeared to be good, and that the representative of the United States was not averse to recognition.On 11th June Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 508] to Sir Auckland Geddes saying that we did not propose to delay7 recognition of the Government of Guatemala indefinitely, unless the situation should change for the worse, but were anxious not to act without regard for the views of the Government of the &quot;United States.CHINA.Chinese Eastern Railway. Telegraphing from Pekin on 10th June [No. 286], Sir Beilby7 Alston reported that the American Legation had shown him a telegram received from (? Mr. Stevens) informing them of the interception of a secret message from the Japanese Chief of Staff [? in Siberia] to the effect that the Japanese had decided to take over the guard of the main line of railway, on account of the increasing number of bandit raids, and that the Chinese Government had been so informed. Should the * Russian railway7 employees protest, the Japanese would replace them from crews o  railwaymen they7 had in readiness.CZECHOSLOVAKIA.The Tesehen Question. -On 8th June Sir Gecrge Clerk asked [No. 103] for instructions in regard to a proposal that the representatives of Great Britain, France and Italy should formally7 suggest to the Czecho-Slovak Government the acceptance of the King of the Belgians as arbitrator in the matter of Teschen. His French colleague had been instructed that he was to make this proposal in conjunction with
himself and the Italian representative, and the last-mentioned had been instructed that he might associate himself with his British and. French colleagues.Telegraphing again two days later [No. 106], he reported that the proposal had been made to the Government by the French and Italian Ministers, the former of whom had been definitely instructed to do so, aloue if necessary. A verbal reply was oiven to the effect that it would be necessary to put the proposal before the Czecho-Slovak Parliament.[See &quot; Poland.&quot;]FRANCE.Statement by M. Millerand. On 10th June Lord Derby telegraphed [No. 691] the following resume of a statement published in the Press which M. Millerand had made that morning to the Commission of Foreign Affairs in the Chamber : The decision of the Allies to allow Turkey to continue as an Asiatic Power necessitated giving her territorial stability (consistence). It was, therefore, necessary to modify the 1916 conventions between France and England. In Europe, Turkey loses East and West Thrace which are given to Greece. The Sultan is maintained at Constantinople, but an inter-allied Commission will be created to guard the liberty of the Straits and the demilitarization of the European and Asiatic coasts. In Asia, Turkey will be surrounded by independent States placed under the mandate of the Allied Powers: France has a mandate over Syria, England over Palestine and Mesopotamia. No Power has hitherto consented to have a mandate over Armenia. The Allied Powers have been brought to make concessions on account of the maintenance of Turkey as an Asiatic Power. For this reason, Cilicia will continue to belong to her, but will be placed in the economic zone of France; that is is say, France will alone direct the economic organization of the country and install there technical advisers. Turkey will keep the suzerainty and have the responsibility of maintaining order. Instructions have been sent to General Gouraud with regard to the negotiations of the French Government. Italy will have in the Gulf of Adalia similar economic control without suzerainty. As regards Smyrna, the Greek occupation will only be definitive after a plebiscite to be held in five years time.M. Millerand said as regards Mosul and ,the petroleum of Mesopotamia, that while he did. not wish to question the&apos;action of the preceding Ministry, he must say that he had not had a free hand. M. Clemenceau had given satisfaction to Mr. Lloyd. George about Mosul in order to obtain a satisfactory agreement about the question of petroleum and of the general question of Syria. England had undertaken to cede to France 25 per cent, of the petroleum production. On the other hand, M. Millerand took the entire responsibility of having neither asked for nor accepted a more extended mandate in the region of Diarbekir.Joan of Are. On 6th June Lord Derby telegraphed [No. 672] that the Under Secretary of State for the Marine had asked him to call Lord Curzoifs special attention to the following telegram from the Mayor of Rouen : The martyrdom of Jeanne d&apos;Arc will be commemorated on 13th June at Rouen under the patronage of the French Government. The municipality solicits the urgent intervention of your ExcellencjT with His Majesty&apos;s Government in order that a delegation from the British Army may attend. Like all Frenchmen, the municipality and people of Rouen cherish with deep gratitude the memory of the landing at our ports of British troops at the beginning of the Great War, and will warmly welcome the men whose presence on the spot Avhere* our national heroine sacrificed herself for her country will attest to the indissoluble attachment of the two nations sealed by the blood of our soldiers.Lord Derby added that he was personally in favour of the project.GERMANY.Welfare Councils in the German Army and Navy. A Avireless message from Nauen, dated 13th June, states that an order of President Ebert creates a provisional Council (Kammer) in the army, whose duty it Avill be to give their opinion and advice to the Ministry of Defence, and a similar Council for the Naval Command. The Council for the army is to be under the chairmanship of the Chief Army Command and consists of 14 officers, 5 medical, 3 veterinary, 3 pyrotechnic, 13 non-commissioned officers and 29 men, while the Council for the navy, under the Chief of the Admiralty, consists of 9 officers, 3 medical, 3 warrant, 4 non-commissioned officers and 6 men. 17-3 . C
Soldiers and sailors will be elected by trustees (sic) in different districts. Eaclr Conncil will organize committees to be convened for a three days&apos; council at Berlin. The whole organization is an absolutely new measure. The Government hope that all desires and proposals coming from the troops will be submitted by these Councils in an official way, while heretofore they have often become known to them in an nnofficial or unmilitary way, so that the Councils will not only advise the Government regarding any new measures planned by the Government, but will also intercede with the Government in the interest of the whole army and navy and on the basis of practical experience. Thais the councils will become connecting links between the command and the army and navy.GREECE.Thrace. On 5th June Admiral de Robeck telegraphed. [No. 660] as follows : -The Grand Vizier renewed in conversation on 2nd June an expression of grave anxiety as to what would happen if the Greeks were allowed to advance into Eastern Thrace before the signature of the Treaty. He referred to a new note which he had just written on the subject, and said the reason he harped on it so much was that he wished to avert useless bloodshed, which could not be avoided if the Greeks entered Eastern Thrace.In reply to the suggestion that Jaffer Tayar might attack the Greeks in the positions recently taken over from the French, the Grand Vizier (&apos;? said he could) prevent such attack if he could&apos; give the supporters of Jaffer Tayar an immediate assurance that the Greeks would not invade Eastern Thrace pending the signature of the Treaty, and he urged that he should be placed in the position to give this assurance at once.The position as regards the Central Government appears to be as follows :  Jaffer Tayar holds no official position but controls the situation at Adrianople : the military and civil authorities work with him, whilst acknowledging the authority of the Central Government. There seems to be a general understanding that Jaffer Tayar will hold his hand unless and until the Greeks advance, but that the Government will not disapprove of his taking action when that happens.The Grand Vizier is anxious to maintain this equilibrium. It is, however, very unstable, because, even if it is not upset by a Greek invasion, Jaffer Tayar may be unable to resist the temptation to attack the Greeks in their present positions.The Grand Vizier did not appear to have any inkling of a possible Greek invasion from the Sea of Marmora coast.Telegraphing on 11th June from Sofia, Sir Herbert Dering reported [No. 63] as follows : The officer commanding the military mission has returned from Western Thrace and reports that (? the Greeks) now have 40,000 troops in the province, from Kara-gat ch to Xanthi, in three (? divisions) respectively at Urli, South Adriauoplc, at Ferscrutjik, north of Dedeagatch, and at Gumuljina, and a fourth division was expected at Xanthi from Salonica.The railway&apos; communication between Sofia and Constantinople remains undis-disturbed while telegraphic communication appears now to be restored, for the military mission have swift messages.The Greek military commanders consider the moment for any resistance by the Turks in Thrace as past, and feel secure. When, however, the Greeks attempt to advance over the river eastwards the Turks will undoubtedly offer a strong resistance. The Greek commanders state that the Turks have plenty of ammunition, even asserting the presence of heavy artillery obtained from over the Bulgarian frontier. There was no sign of artillery, and the Turkish commander, though perfectly &quot;courteous, did not allow Major Neate to see anything.Both General Zimbrakakis, commanding the Dedeagatch corps, and another Greek officer stated that a division would be landed at Gallipoli, and seemed to have an erroneous anticipation of a British advance in support from (? Chatalja).The Bulgarian villagers state that the Greek troops are behaving well ; what they fear is the intolerance of the Greek inhabitants, who talk of overrunning the-country, and the advance of Gresks to Philippopolis.Sir Herbert Dering had previously telegraphed on 7th June [No. 60] reporting-that a note dated 26th May had been received from Nedim Bey, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the self-styled Government of National Defence of the Independent
State of Western Thrace, requesting hint to communicate its contents to His Majestv&apos;s-Government as soon as possible, and to inform them of the situation in that -country.(? In view of) the occupation of Western Thrace by the Greek army under (group tmdecypherable) the Government has been constituted trnder the protection of the French Government, and by the desire of the large Bulgarian-Mussulman majority, :as well as of all the communes, has proclaimed the independence of Western Thrace.The Government is based on the principles formulated by President Wilson, which were supported by the victorious Powers. It protests against this arbitrary -occupation and appeals to the European sentiments of justice and humanity.It declares their desire to cultivate good and friendly relations with their neigh hours, and that they are a peaceful Government which will guarantee the rights of their citizens without distinction of race or religion.They will defend to the end their rights and aims by force of arms until the soil of Western Thrace is evacuated by the aggressor.It has earnest hopes that its legitimate rights will be recognized at last by the Allies.M, Millerand and the Occupation of Eastern Thrace. On 7th June Lord -Granville reported [No. 138] that he had been informed by the Foreign Minister that M. Millerand had expressed strong approval of the Iving&apos;s proposal to occupy Eastern Thrace, and had added that &quot; he was convinced &quot; that his views were shared by His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem. On 11th June Lord Granville reported [No. 146] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had asked him to assure the British Government that the Greek Government made no sort of claim to any control of the -Orthodox Patriarchate of J erusalem, and. that their interest in it was purely moral and religious. He feared that the Greek Consul might have overstepped his instructions .and said something to give rise to suspicions. If so, and if the Consul was not a persona grata to General Bols, the Minister for Foreign Affairs was quite ready to change him.HUNGARY.General Situation. On 5th June Mr. Hohler telegraphed [No. 343] saying that a short time ago there seemed to be good hope for the establishment of real order, but now the situation grew rapidly worse day by day, and serious incidents were daily of more frequent occurrence. Something like a &quot; white terror &quot; had come into existence, though a month ago talking of one was absurd.Exchange of Hungarian and Russian Subjects. On 7th June Mr. Grant Watson reported [No. 583] from Copenhagen that an agreement had been concluded between M. Litvinoff and a representative of the Hungarian Government for the mutual exchange of Hungarian subjects in Russia, and Russians in Hungary.JAPAN.The Treaty of Alliance with Great Britain. On 8th June Sir Charles Eliot telegraphed [No. 218] the proposed text of a joint note from Great Britain and Japan to the League of Nations to the following effect:- -Both Governments earnestly desire-to respect the letter of the Covenant of the League of Nations, and, having come to-the conclusion that their treaty of alliance is not entirely consistent with that letter, though in harmony with the spirit of the Covenant, jointly inform the League that their treaty can only continue in a form consistent with the Covenant after 1st July of next year.MEXICO.Special Mission to Europe.-On J2th June Mr. Cummins reported from Mexico [No. 144] that the provisional President had appointed Sefior Palavicini to undertake a special mission to Great Britain, France, Italy, Spain and Belgium, and that he would leave Tampico on 21st June. He would first visit Great Britain to ascertain the grievances of His Majesty&apos;s Government with a view to their redress, and to obtain
recognition of Obregon&apos;s Government. He had expressed a hope that he would he well received in spite of legitimate grievances, and Mr. Cummins had reassured him on this point,PERSIA.The Shah and his Prime Minister. - On. 7th June Lord Curzon telegraphed [No.- 311] to Sir Percy Cox as follows : The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs thinks that the Shah should be urged to take energetic action, without delay, to prove publicly that he supports the Prime-Minister, and that for this purpose he should issue a proclamation urging that order and security be maintained and warning the people against dangerous propaganda-His Majesty should make it clear that he approves the policy7 pursued by the Govern-ment, and make an appeal for union among all classes to save the country from danger. The Minister for Foreign Affairs thinks that the Shah should furthermore summon the notables and speak to them similarly7. He adds that for the full effect of these measures to be felt they7 should be taken at once.He proposes to telegraph himself direct to the Shah, and suggests that y7ou should confer with the Prime Minister on the subject.The plan is worth trying and you should act accordingly7.As to Starosselsky7, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs thinks that the Shah should now be pressed to dismiss him, and I agree that no time should be lost,. What are your views on this point ?Telegraphing on 8th June [No. 35b], Sir Percy7 Cox reported that he had had an audience with the Shah, who said that he would support Vossuk-ed-Dowdek as long-as we wanted him, though on his return he had found that he was very unpopular-arid had many enemies. He agreed, however, that it would not be easy to replace him. As to the Cossack divisions, Starosselsky and his troops -were devoted to-himself, and it was against his personal inclination to act as we wished; but he acquiesced. The solution of the difficulty must, he added, be a matter of deliberation, between himself, the Prime Minister, and the Legation.Vossuk-ed-Dowleh had had two long interviews with the Shah and had been much disappointed with them. The Shah, he said, was ready7 with expressions of approval and promises of support; but when it came from the general to the particular, the question was burked by the Shah promising to consider it at leisure. Finance played a prominent part in the discussions, the Shah demanding the^ repayment of what he had expended in Europe as an earnest of the Prime mini steps frijndly intentions. Vossuk-ed-Dowleh said that he was obliged to promise to find the amount, hut did not know &quot;where to look fur it ; he regarded the Shah s attitude-as evidence that His Majesty had not changed his spots.The Shah referred again to the unpopularity of Vossuk-ed-Dowleh in the audience accorded to Mr. Norman on his assumption of the duties of British Minister in succession to Sir Percy7 Cox. Telegraphing on 11th June [No.. 371], Mr. Norman said that the Shah had told him that &quot;Vossuk-ed-Dowleh was viewed with disfavour in most quarters, and had complained of his repressive policy7, which, in his opinion,, increased discontent; he was, however, determined to abide by the pledge he had given.Mr. Norman telegraphed on the same subject again on 14th June [Nos. 380 and. 381], saying that at the request of Vossuk-ed-Dowleh himself he had reported to the Shah the contemplated resignation of his Prime Minister for the reason that he felt that he no longer possessed His Majesty7 s full confidence.   The Shah repeated that, whilst he fully7 recognized the unpopularity of the Government, he was perfectly satisfied with them ; he pointed out that in Persia the Government was regarded as the Sovereign&apos;s, and that consequently7 discontent aroused by7 any7 arbitrary proceedings of the Prime Minister would be directed against himself, if there was good reason for the act, that did not matter, but it was a mistake to lose popularity7 for nothing. This was said in consequence of the Shah having- asked Mr. Norman what tangible proof the Prime Minister would adduce of a withdrawal of confidence, and Mr. Norman, in reply, having mentioned the Shah&apos;s reluctance to give the Prime Minister a free hand in dealing with persons who were suspected of plotting against the Government, The Shah said that he did not object to action being taken against insignificant people on any ground, but he disliked people of importance being arrested and. deported simply7 for saying things which the Prime Minister did not like ; but even in their case if it could be shown that they7 were really dangerous, he would sanction
anv measures considered necessary by tbe Prime Minister. He authorized Mr. Norman. to convey to His Excellency an assurance of. his full confidence.By arrangement with Vossuk-ed-Dowleh the Acting Foreign Minister called -upon Mr. Norman to ascertain what had passed between him and the Shah. His Excellency agreed that Mr. Norman had done well not to press the Shah too hard --and so risk the loss of his goodwill.The Acting Foreign Minister regarded the leading of the Russian officers in Persia with grave apprehension ; he considered their intrigues dangerous, not only to the throne but the State. But Mr. Norman added that it appeared possible, from information he had received, that Colonel Starosselsky was not extremely anxious to remain in Persia, and might be willing to leave if he were sufficiently well paid for so doing.Soviet Proclamations. The following message was sent by Sir Percy Cox on .10th June [No. 361J :-Three telegrams, of which the summary is given below, reached Teheran this morning from Resht, but the Persian Government have for the present forbidden their delivery, and when they become known they propose to point out their absurdity : (1) Proclamation to aR the. people. The Red Revolutionary Committee of Persia, after the formation of the Soviet Republican Government and the official announcement of the same to the public, has nominated the following persons as -Commissaries for the conduct of the Administration. The)7 are notified in order that the affairs of (? party) (? local) departments may be referred to them. Any person seeing anything wrong in any department of the Administration is at liberty to draw their attention to It. [Then follow the names of 10 local inhabitants -as Commissaries of State.](2j Addressed to the American, and French Legations and other foreign repre-sentatives at Teheran.The English, after the outbreak of the world-consuming war, in order to achieve their unlawful ends, violated the neutrality of Persia and sent their armed (? forces) into the country and brought about the (? ruin of) the country and the people. In reply to the repeated protests of the Nationalists, they gave a categorical promise that -on the conclusion of the world war they would release and relieve Persia and the Persians from the burden of their troops. War ended and peace was officially -declared, but the pressure exercised by the English, in the absence of a National Parliament, towards the country and the people, ihcreased so that by force of the assistance of British power and covetousness (group undecypherabie) a military Government was instituted at the capital and in the provinces, and an ill-omened and independence-breaking agreement was brought about which is incompatible with the dignity and the aspirations of the people. It reached such an extent that even the appeals of the oppressed and their full (sic) powers were prevented from reaching the assemblies of the partizans of humanity.Now the Council of the Republic of Persia which, before being extended to the capital, was formed in Gilasome, decrees in the name of the Persian nation, pending the establishment of a Republican Parliament in the capital, that all kinds of agree-ments which tbe British Government may give or have made with the Persian Government are (? illegal) and annulled.(3) Through the Legation of the American Republic and the honoured French Minister and the representatives of all the Powers in Teheran.The Red Revolutionary Committee of Persia on 6th June in the name of the people of Persia, upon our (group undecypherabie) existence and monarchy (? was) abolished, and the Provisional Government of the Republican Council was established, and proclaimed. By the medium of the said Legations may it be known that affectionate foreign relations (group undecypherabie) was sent (? group omitted) it be known to all Legations of Foreign Powers residing in Teheran. We hope and request that they will communicate the same to their Governments. (Signed) Red -Revolutionary Committee, Yan.POLAND.The Teschen Question. (See also under &quot;Czecho-Slovakia.&quot;)   On 6th June Sir H, Rumbold reported [No. 376] that the French Minister had submitted to - the Minister -ior Foreign Affairs the suggestion put forward by the French Government that by 17-3 D
agreement between the Governments of Poland and Czeeho-Slovakia the King of the Belgians should be invited to arbitrate on the Teschen question.While he appeared personally favourable to the suggestion, and undertook to. submit it to his Cabinet, the Minister for Foreign Affairs proposed a modification, in the sense that a direct agreement might be come to by the Polish and Czecho-Slovak Governments regarding districts in the Duchy of Teschen which the Government was prepared to lecognize as indisputably Polisher Czech; and that the King of the Belgians be invited to arbitrate with regard to the remaining limited area.The Situation. Telegraphing [No. 392] on 7th June, Sir Horace gave his-appreciation of the situation at that time. He gathered that the general view, held in all classes, of the negotiations about to begin in London between the Supreme Economic Council and Krassin was that they would afford a certain amount of moral support to the Bolsheviks at the very moment that Poland was involved in a desperate struggle with them, a fact which excited some feeling among the Poles.The military information regarding the attacks and numbers of the Bolsheviks had proved to be accurate, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs had told him that he intended to propose to the Bolsheviks a renewal of peace discussions as soon as the northern Polish line was re-established. The Bolsheviks might be expected to follow one of two lines : (1) they would either find some pretext for declining to enter on peace discussions, with a view to the success of a further projected offensive, or (2) they would, delay &quot;negotiations while preparing a further offensive against the Poles. This would be a repetition of their tactics when the question of a meeting place was-macle the ostensible reason for the breakdown of the former peace pourparlers.Cabinet Crisis.  On 9th June Sir H. Rumbold reported [No. 390] the&quot; defeat of the Government by three votes on the question of the sequestration of agricultural produce, on which the Prime Minister tendered the resignation of the-Cabinet. It was uncertain whether the formation of a new Government would be entrusted to him or not. The cause of the crisis was the action of the leader of the-Peasant Party. The interest of the peasants, who are the biggest profiteers in Poland,, appears to have been placed by him above the interests of the country. It is-considered a most unfortunate moment for a Cabinet crisis and a change of Government.Telegraphing on 12th June [No. 403], Sir Horace said that efforts to form a Left Centre Government having broken down, a proposal would be brought forward that., day by the retiring Prime Minister for the formation of a Coalition Government composed of representatives of all parties, which would see the country through the present crisis, terminate the war, negotiate a peace, and remain in office until the plebiscites were decided.This proposal was obviously a sound one in the present circumstances, but it might break down on the question of the selection of a Prime Minister.In a later telegram [No. 407] , dated 13th June, he reported that he had received information that all attempts to form a Cabinet had failed, and that the Marshal of the Diet would propose to the Chief of the State that the latter should appoint a Cabinet.Municipal Workers&apos; Strike. Of the strike of the municipal workers reported [No. 383] on 8th June, Sir H. Rumbold reported [No. 398] on 11th June that the strike continued and was increasing, but it had not affected work in the factories and the mills. The fire brigade struck on 9th June for higher wages, but as at the same time they demanded the dismissal of three officers, it was evident that the character -of this strike was as much political, not to say Bolshevik, as economic. The strike had a decidedly political character and was most injurious to Poland at the present-juncture.RUSSIA.Message from M. Chicherin. On 13th June,the following message [No. 92] was-Teceived from M. Chicherin : -The first interviews of the members of the British. Government with M. Krassin, the head of the Commercial Delegation, and other representatives of the Russian Ceutrosoyuz, have shown the intimate connexion between trade questions and political issues. At the impending meeting of the Allied-Prime Ministers these will no doubt be discussed in view, among other things, of the new situation in Asia. As you already know, our diplomatic representative empowered for treating these questions is M. Litvinoff, now in Copenhagen.    His-
participation in the negotiations connected with, the Prime Ministers&apos; meeting would greatly facilitate the reaching of an agreement satisfactory for all sides, whilst all guarantees desired by your Government can be given. The full powers given to him are herewith confirmed.South Russia.General Wrangel. On 5th June Admiral de Robeck reported [No. 657] that Admiral Hope had communicated in writing the contents of Lord Curzon&apos;s telegram, No. 488, to General Wrangel, who had stated in reply that the conditions in the Crimea had changed considerably since he took command. The army was very much improved, but the food situation was becoming critical. He hadsalready informed the British Government that he could not negotiate with the Soviets, and that he had not sufficient food for the army and the population. As the only alternative to evacuation or capitulation was an increase of the food supplies, he was forced to make an offensive to obtain more food from the producing territory, and had given orders to that effect. He wished His Majesty&apos;s Government to understand that this was being done not with any aggressive intention, but solely to obtain food. General VVrangel wordd hand a written reply to Admiral Hope, who would bring it, to Constantinople. Kriveshein had informed Admiral Hope that while he was in Paris the French Government advised that General Wrangel should not enter into negotiations Avith the Soviets, and that the French would try to persuade London not to press the matter. His Majesty&apos;s Ship (name undecypherabie) had perceived a sea and land expedition on a considerable scale preparing at Theodosia for an unknown objective. His Majesty&apos;s ships had orders not to assist if offensive operations were commenced. General Wrangel had a large army Avell equipped and disciplined, and was an important factor in the general situation.On 11th June Lord Curzon informed Admiral de Robeck [No. 536] that orders were being issued by the War Office to withdraw the British military mission from the Crimea without delay, in view of General Wrangel&apos;s action in opposition to our advice. The Admiralty Avould adopt a similar policy in regard to the action of British ships in Crimean waters.Ukraina.Economic Conditions. Sir Horace Rumbold reported from WarsaAv on 5th June [No. 380] that the Polish Minister of Finance had informed the Commercial Secretary that the Polish Government Avere in a position to state that there Avere considerable stocks of grain in Ukraina, and that only a small area, comparatively speaking, had not been cultivated. This A/ear&apos;s crops promised to be exceptionally good, and M. Grabski hoped that, proAnded transport facilities exist, it would be possible to export abroad a considerable quantity of AAdieat. He further stated that there Avere large stocks of sugar.(?In accordance with) the agreement between the Polish and Ukrainan Govern-ments considerable quantities of sugar and corn would be allocated to Poland for export.M. Grabski further stated that a special department for trade with Ukraina had been established at the Ministry of Finance at Warsaw, and urged on Mr. Kimens the desirability, in the interests of Great Britain, of studying the economic question of Ukraina.M. Grabski was of opinion that the northern proA*inces of Russia Avould not be in a position to give any grain for export.Recognition of General Petlura&apos;s Government by Finland.-Telegraphing from Helsingfors on 13th June [No. 499], Mr. Kidston reported that the Finnish Goverh-ment had decided to recognize General Petlura&apos;s Government as the de facto Government of the Ukrainan Republic.SERBIA.Relations with Hungary. Sir C. Young telegraphed [No. 166] from Belgrade, on 13th June, that relations between Hungary and Serbia were practically suspended owing to a personal incident connected with Dr. Baitch. The note in Avhich the Hungarian envoy there informed the Serbian Government that the Hungarian Government had been obliged to cease all contact with the Serb-Croat-Slovene representative at Budapest, and asking for his recalR had been returned to him, and
Sir C. Young understood that no further relations would he held with him so lono- as Dr. Baitch was similarly treated.: In a conversation that morning the President of the Council mentioned to him his impressions of the manner in which the matter might he put right, includino- the eventual recall of the objectionable M. Baitch, and Sir Cbarles had telegraphed his-impression of the conversation to His Maj esty&apos;s High Commissioner at Budapest.SYRIA.Message from Emir Feisal to the Prime Minister and Lord Curzon. On 4th June Lord Allenby transmitted [No. 541] the following message to the Prime Minister from the Emir Feisal: To lay stress upon the subject of my last telegram, I have the honour to inform you that the French military authorities of Beirut are arming the Syrian Christians in the western zone against their Moslem fellow countiymen. You will understand that this will cause serious consequences throughout the country. Not only have the Moslems and Christians of Syria always lived like brothers in their common country, but they have never forsaken this brotherly life even when, profiting by the great war, the young Turks tried to excite Moslem opinion against Christians. In any case in the eastern zone no animosity appears to have set one against the other.It appears then that bad French administration is the cause of all the troubles which exist almost everywhere in the western zone. If then the assistance which France wishes to give Syria is that of divide et impera, we can only refuse it plainly.I protest against this Bible policy for which henceforward I decline responsi-bility.To prevent the spread of these troubles throughout the world of Syria I beg you to intercede with the French Government to stop the arming of Christians referred to, and to hand over the administration of the Syrian coast to the Government at Damascus in accordance with the decision of the Conference at San Remo concerning the independence of Syrian States.Please excuse me if in view of the troubles which exist in the western zone, which I fear may spread here, I still delay my departure for Europe to assist at the Conference which will soon be held in Paris.On the following day Lord Allenby transmitted [No. 547] this message for Lord Curzon : As I have informed you previously by various cables regarding (? the discontent of) the country, and especially the recent disturbances in the zone occupied by the French, I have much fear that a complete loss of public security throughout the Arab country will be the result if I leave for the West, As you are aware, I alone maintain public security and have undertaken the responsibility to you particularly for its maintenance. I, therefore, request that you would inform me whether in the circumstances yon consider I should accept the invitation and leave the country in its present state, or whether it would not be preferable for you to send delegates upon whom you can rely for the preliminary discussions connected with the country, the destiny of which is to be decided by the Peace Conference. If you agree, kindly propose this to the French authorities for their acceptance.In transmitting the second message, Lord Allenby said [No. 546] that he considered that the EmiFs absence from Syria would certainly7 lead to disorder as he was the one restraining influence that now remained. He had therefore suggested that he should choose representatives whom he could send with full powers to act for him at the Peace Conference as he considered it improbable that the Conference would send a delegate to him in Syria. *. The Evacuation of Abu Kamal. On 8th June Lord Allenby reported [No. 550] that he had received a communication from the Arab Ministry for Foreign Affairs at Damascus to the effect that the evacuation of Abu Kamal on the Euphrates by British troops had made a remarkably7 good impression on the Arab Government and would be accepted by the people of Synla as a sign of cordiality on the part of His Maj esty&apos;s Government.France and Syria. On 9th June Lord Allenby reported [No. 559] that he had -received from the Arab Ministry7 for Foreign Affairs at Damascus copies of two telegrams, one from M. Millerand to the Emil Feisal and the other the latter&apos;s reply7. -
In his telegram, which was sent on 30th April, the French Minister, whilst confirming the recognition of Syrian independence, pointed out that the Arab aspirations could not be realized without help, and added that France had received a mandate to give. Syria that help in the work of organizing herself. At the same time she would guarantee protection against any outside aggression.Replying to this the Emir took strong-exception to the disregard of Syrian unity and indivisibility in M. Milierand&apos;s message which he said had had a deplorable effect. He went on to say that the British communication in regard to Palestine and the Jews had been even more exasperating: the handing over of Palestine would never be . agreed to by Syrians. As to French assistance, it had created so many dangers that he could not recognize the San Remo decisions : provided, however, that the negotiations were based on a recognition of Syrian independence and indivisibility, he would be willing to treat with the French Government in regard to this assistance. He pointed out that Syria was independent in fact, and he only wished that to be recognized.Emir Said. On 10th June Lord Curzon informed [No. 33] Mr. Wratislaw at Beirut that Emir Said had been permitted to return to Syria by the French, on condition that he should be interned on his arrival, and that when at Constantinople he should hold no communication with the shore.TURKEY.The Prime Minister and the Peace Negotiations. On 7th June Admiral de Robeck telegraphed [No. 667] saying that the Grand Vizier had frequently spoken of his intention to go to Paris for the final stage of the negotiations. In conversation he had always spoken as though his intention were to assume the leadership of the Peace Delegation. He seemed to have asked the French High Commissioner, however, whether he could not go unofficially and converse with the Allied statesmen without forming part of the Delegation though keeping in touch with it. The French High Commissioner had expressed bis personal opinion that this would be impracticable.The French Government had now approved this expression of opinion, apparently after consulting the Allies, and had suggested that it should be confirmed to the Grand Vizier as from the Allied Governments. The Italian High Commissioner had been authorized by his Government to join. in.He (Admiral de Robeck) had told the French High Commissioner that he had no instructions and doubted whether&apos; he should receive any as the Grand Vizier had not represented the matter to him in the same light. He had suggested that as the communication to the Porte wordd be in any case verbal, he should say it was the result of consultation between the Allied Governments, and he had authorized him to say that he personally was entirely of the same opinion.Admiral de Robeck telegraphed again on 10th June [No. 681] as follows : (1) The Grand Vizier has now decided positively to leave by sea for Marseilles on 12th June : he should reach Paris about 19th June.(2) He paid me a farewell visit on 9th June. He again made an urgent appeal for a revision of the peace terms in the sense which would leave to Turkey all the areas in which the Turkish language predominated.(3) He prefaced his remarks by an assertion of his conviction (which had been confirmed by what passed in Paris last year, and by the statements of Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Balfour) that the Allies did not hold the Turkish dynasty, or people responsible for the entry of Turkey into the Avar, and that they contemplated a peace of justice, not of punishment. - ., ,(4) As regards Thrace he invoked statistics, which according to him show an undoubtedly Moslem majority. He said that he did not wish to reopen the question of the area between the Kara Su and the Maritza, although it contained 1,000,000 Moslems as against 300,000 non-Moslems of all kinds, and although the Peace Conference had, he declared, laid it down last year that this area would share the fate of Constantinople. He did - urge that Turkey should retain the country east of the Maritza, where the majority was also Moslem, and Adrianople, with which Turkey had many ties. . .(5) He added nothing new about Smyrna, but once more insisted that the majority of the population in that area were Moslem. 17-3 E
(6) As regards Armenia, he complained that Turkey was asked to commit herself to a frontier not defined in the Treaty, and to do this in regard to a region in which 95 per cent, of the population were Moslems.(7) He again deprecated the creation of a Straits zone which would be in effect a sovereign State between the Sultan and his dominions in Asia. He urged, the object of securing free Straits could be fully obtained by occupying both sides of the Straits only, and the maintenance at sea of as many naval units as the Allies chose.(8) The Grand Vizier said he would not trouble me with more technical details which he hoped would be thrashed out in Commissions in Paris.&quot; He passed to more confidential statements, the gist of which was as follows :-(9) Even if Turkey obtained the mitigation of the peace terms which he bad suggested, she would be so utterly weak internally, and so surrounded by hostile neighbours that she could not long subsist unless she had a strong supporting hand. Would England hold out that hand, and would he have means when in Paris of conveying his views to English statesmen &apos;?(10) I told the Grand Vizier to arm himself with all the statistics and . data he could, as he&apos;would find statisticians at the other end -who had gone very deep into the questions of population raised by him. I pointed out that his suggestion regarding the Straits would involve the maintenance of large naval forces in these waters at a moment when all the Allies were anxious to reduce armaments of this kind. The essential purpose was, I said, to make the waterway absolutely secure, and to achieve this it would be necessary to occupy every part of the littoral from which it would be threatened by gunfire. I admitted that the risk of such a threat was small in view of the disarmament of Turkey, but said that the Allies were on their guard not against people like himself but against people of the type of Enver Pasha and Talaat.(11) Speaking quite personally, I asked whether he was reach7 with any property -posals which would give Turkey access to Anatolia by excluding from the Straits zone some:port like Ismid or Panclerma to which my gunfire argument would not apply. The Grand Vizier persisted in his view that his first suggestion would guarantee all that was necessary ; but said that if IP could be agreed to in principle that a separate zone extending from the Dardanelles to the Black Sea was unnecessary a detailed solution could be worked out by technical experts.(12) I said I could not -express an opinion as to the prospect of future support from England, but promised to report all he had said to your Lordship.(13) The Grand Vizier urged the illusoriness of the hope that a stable equilibrium could be created by the peace now contemplated. England no doubt wanted a durable peace; but the lesson of history was that Greece could never hold on to great possessions. She had held them under individually great men, but when those men passed away Greece had lost her grip in. Asia and in the Archipelago. In Europe, Greece was under a perpetual threat from tire Slav.(11) What would happen, he asked, if the Sultan and the Government made up their minds to sign - the treaty whatever it might be, and Thrace and Anatolia went into revolt. I parried this by saying it would be hard to know whether Thrace was in revolt against the Sultan or at war with Greece. He said Thrace had hitherto listened to him, but the attitude of the leaders there was that they would withdraw . their obedience to the Central Government if the Central Government proved incapable of defending them. The Central Government would only defend them hy argument, and if the Greeks crossed the Maritza the leaders in Thrace would consider that the Central Government had failed.   Thrace would then be at war with Greece.(15) I said the Conference had doubtless envisaged every possibility. They had certainty told the Greeks what they had to undertake.The Grand Vizier, asked eagerly whether the Greeks had been told not to invade Thrace before the signature of peace. I said they could not do so without (?.goocl) authority from the Conference.Appeal to the King of Spain. On 7th June Lord Derby telegraphed from Paris [No. 683] saying that the Spanish Ambassador had informed him that the Turkish Grand Vizier had written to the King of Spain and to the Queen Mother, asking their Majesties to intervene with the Allied Powers with a view7 to getting some mitigation of the Treaty of Peace, the severity of which he considered excessive and incompatible with the existence of Turkey and the Ottoman sovereignty7, at any rate as regards countries of Turkish language.Answer of His Majesty the King to the Sultan s Letter [B.E.P., xviii., p. 11].-On the 5th June the following answer to the Sultan&apos;s letter to His Majesty7 the King
was telegraphed [No. 506] to&apos; Admiral de Robeck : I have received your Majesty&apos;s appeal of 27th May. The future of Turkey is in the hands of the Allied Govern-ments, who have devoted long and patient effort to the construction of an equitable Treaty of Peace, and who may be trusted to act with justice to all parties and interests concerned.The Ismid District.-On 10th June Admiral de Robeck reported [No. 682]&quot;that he had been informed by General Milne that the British troops in the Ismid district would now be left face to face with the Nationalist forces, the loyal Turkish troops having expressed their intention to withdraw as they were unable to maintain their present positions. An advance to the Bosphorus was the avowed aim of the Nationalists.Admiral de Robeck went on to say that he had asked General Milne to prevent the Nationalist forces entering the Ismid peninsula, and that he was arranging for the navy to support the troops. Any retirement of our troops would be most undesirable, whilst allowing the Nationalists to take possession of the Ismid peninsula by a withdrawal of our troops would render our position in Constantinople impossible.The maintenance of our control of the peninsula was, he added, as much in the interests of the French and Italians as in our own, and it was most necessary that they should take their part by providing the quota of troops required.The French and, Cilicia. On 3rd June Sir George Grahame reported from Paris [No. 657] that he had been officially informed that though one or two small exposed posts were being evacuated for military reasons, there was no question of a with-drawal from Cilicia.General Gouraud and Mustafa Kemal. On 4th June Admiral de Robeck tele-graphed [No. 654] that Admiral Le Bon had informed him that General Gouraud had arranged for an armistice with the forces of Mustafa Kemal, lasting 20 days and beginning at midnight 31st May 1st June, and the.French High Commissioner had confirmed the information.Further, it appeared that General Gouraud had sent an envoy to Mustafa Kemal, pointing out that as the French did not intend to retain Cilicia he did not wish for any further bloody fighting for a country in which the French (? interested) themselves.Mustafa Kemal and M. Chicherin. On 12th June Admiral de Robeck trans-mitted [No. 695] a message which he said [No. 694] was contained in a Soviet wireless news report read by our station at Constantinople. The message was dated 10th June, and ran as follows : M. Chicherin received a letter from Mustafa Kemal, in which he expresses the desire to start diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia at once, and to unite both States in their struggle with international Imperialism. M. Chicherin in his reply says that, the Soviet Government notes with satisfaction the fact that the programme of the Nationalists is in full accord with the principles of the Soviet Government, and in order to establish a close friendship with Turkey it is ready to send Russian diplomatic and consular representatives to Turkey. M. Chicherin. ends his letter by wishing Mustafa Kemal every success in his present struggle.UNITED STATES&quot; OF AMERICA.Food Shortage. Sir Auckland Geddes reported on 8th June [No. 434] that in all probability mere would be a very small exportable surplus of this year&apos;s harvest. It was possible that an attempt might be made either to prohibit the export of food or to control it, as we had ;done with coal, with differential prices for internal and external consumption. The Secretary of State was anxious, and had asked him for help in obtaining any available figures showing, by countries, the probable supply of and demand for wheat. Sir Auckland hoped that it might be possible to make the American public realize by such figures what the world-position was, if they could be supplied before political agitation had sufficiently developed to encourage the adoj)tion of the differential price policy.
