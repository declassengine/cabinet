FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Anti-British Propaganda. The Viceroy of India telegraphed ori 20th October [No. 14238] that reports had been received to the effect that the Wazir and the Mahsucl maliks in Matun had been told by the hakim of Khost that the maliks of all the frontier tribes were going to Kabul to discuss their relations with the British and Afghan Governments with envoys from Germany^ Russia, Turkey and Persia; and that the hakim, saying that nothing more than a six months&apos; armistice had been arranged between the British and the Afghans, had advised the maliks to continue to harass the former.The Viceroy also reported that similar propaganda was being spread by Shah Daula, who had returned to Wana from Khost; and telegraphing again on 27th October [No. 14599] he said that this propaganda was having a bad effect on the Wazirs and Maksuds.ARMENIA.The Zangezur District. [F.C.R. ii., page 1.] On 14th October Mr. Wardrop transmitted [No. 69] the substance of a telegram which had been sent from Erivan by Captain Gracey. The latter said that the Azerbaijans claimed that the Zangezur district was part of the Azerbaijan territory ; in reply to which Armenia maintained that the cpiestion was not one of frontiers but of the creation of a temporary State for the purpose of preventing sanguinary conflicts. Armenia considered Zangezur an integral part of Armenia, and that any attempt to usurp it by violence must cause bloody results for which Azerbaijan would be responsible. Armenia was ready to discuss all cpuestions at issue between the two Republics, and to find an issue consistent with the dignity of, and acceptable to, both.Telegraphing from Tiflis on 28th October [No. 96], Mr. Warclrop said that the Georgian Government was doing all it could to prevent a serious collision (which was almost inevitable) between Armenia and Azerbaijan in this district by pointing out the lamentable results which would follow a conflict, not only locally, but also- in Paris. Telegraphing again three days later [No. 105], he said that he was more hopeful of the situation.Interview with the President. On 19th October Mr. Wardrop telegraphed [No. 81] some notes of a journey he had made in Armenia, in the course of which he had more than one interview with the President.The latter had begged him to intercede with His Majesty&apos;s Government for the immediate recognition of Armenian independence, which wordd, he said, enormously aid his Government from the financial, political, and military points of view. The President also said that Armenia desired above all tilings that a mandate should be given to Great Britain, failing that to Great Britain and America jointly, or failing this in turn to America only. But in any case those employed to cany out the mandate should be British.Mr. Wardrop added that the state, of public health was deplorable ; in Erivan there were epidemics of cholera as well as of typhus and. other fevers. The President had implored him to help with clothing, boots, medicine, &amp;c.The Armenians in Mesopotamia and Aleppo.  [F.C.R. ii., page 3.] On 31st October Lord Curzon instructed [No. 1219] Lord Derby to inform the French Government that the Armenians whom, it was proposed to transfer from Mesopotamia were self-supporting, and were understood to be pre-war residents in Cilicia ; there were only 750 of them. As to those in Aleppo, the advisability of removing from Syria an element which might become an additional source of disturbance was obvious.AUSTRIA.Economic Situation in Vienna. Sir William Goocle, telegraphing from Vienna to Sir John Bradbury on 27th October [No. 3350], reported that the privation in that city
was very real. The food problem bad, be said, been rendered more complicated by the hoJdiiig-np of food trains from Trieste, by the lack of coal, and by the Serbian -officials detaining supplies, -which had been paid lor, by a demand for 40 per cent, export duty.THE BALTIC.The Meeting with the Soviet Delegates. Telegraphing from Reval on 25th October : Xo. 330], Mr. Bosanquet reported that the following wireless message had been sent to Mr. Chicherin by the Esthonian Minister of Foreign Affairs :  The Lithuanian Government informs us that it can only negotiate with the Bolsheviks under the conditions of the armistice. As regards the Lettland Govern-ment, with whom we are negotiating, it is much occupied with a conflict with the German-Russian military detachments which have mutinied. In view of these facts the first joint meeting for the preliminary peace pourparlers at Tartu Yurieff by 25th October has become impossible. But the Esthonian Government has not changed its attitude in regard to peace, and will be ready later on to enter into negotiations, and the exact date of the meeting will be communicated as soon as possible.Situation in Latvia. Telegraphing from Riga on 25th October [No 185],.Colonel Tallents reported that the liberties of Latvia were being threatened by a German force, in repelling which the Letts were doing work for which, under the armistice, the Allies were responsible. The condition of affairs was raising the most bitter political feeling.Latvia and Esthonia.-Telegraphing from Riga [No. 180] on 22nd October, Colonel Tallents reported that the Esthonian terms for the assistance of Latvia would not be accepted by the Letts, and the Esthonians were threatening to withdraw the armoured trains, the only help they had given.Danzig. On 28th October Lord Ourzon informed [No. 344] Sir Horace Rumbold, Minister at Warsaw, that Sir Reginald Tower expected to arrive at Danzig about 8th November, having been, appointed temporary administrator of that place.BRAZIL.Commercial Relations with Germany. Sir Ralph Paget, Ambassador at Rio de -Janeiro, reported on 30th October [No. 203] that on 16th August last the Brazilian Government issued a circular cancelling that of 1st January 1915, which prohibited commercial relations with German subjects.Another circular, dated 22nd October, had been issued stating that the President had decided to allow German ships free access to Brazilian ports.THE CAUCASUS.Relations of the States. Telegraphing from Tiflis on 20th October [No. 81], Mr. AYarclrop reported a general and growing- desire in the three Republics to work together. In each the Government had expressed their strong desire for the abolition of customs barriers, for a united currency, and for the collective control of railways, posts, telegraphs, &amp;c. These Republics, Mr. Wardrop added, had already shown their fitness for self-government, and they were the only part of what was Russia where Bolshevism had not had any success, with the exception of Baku for a short period during which it was in the hands of foreigners.Future of the Republics. On 20th October Mr. Wardrop reported [No. 85] that he had been asked by the Georgian Minister for Foreign Affairs to inform Lord Curzon that the continued silence of the Allies on the subject of the future fate of Trans-Caucasia, and more especially the silence of Great Britain, was causing great nervousness, not only in the Cabinet and in Parliament, but throughout the country. This nervousness was not confined to any one of the Republics, but was common to them all ; they were, he said, working together towards federation, but they were oppressed by a constant fear of General Denikin and the uncertainty of their future status had a paralysing effect. The Foreign Minister said that his Government asked that at the very least they should be favoured with some such message as had been given to the (V Baltic States) : even a declaration by the Peace Conference that the
Trans-Caucasian question&quot; would be treated as an international one might have a-pacifying effect. They could not believe it possible that they would ever again be abandoned to Russian rule, under which they had suffered injustice, oppression, and (? degradation).The Azerbaijan Government and General Denikin. On 24th October Mr. Wardrop reported [No. 99] that the Azerbaijan Government had received a communication from General Denikin&apos;s agent, dated 17th October, enclosing a statement, dated 21st September, signed by Vice-Aclmiral Gerasinon, to the effect, that in accordance with Article S of the Treaty of Turkmenshai he would not permit any (? Azerbaijan) naval force in the Caspian or any merchant vessels not flying the Russian flag.The Azerbaijan Government have informed General Denikin&apos;s agent that the-Turkmenshai Treaty [made in 1828 between Russia and Persia] does not apply to-ilzerbaijan, and that they regard the demand as calculated to disturb neighbourly relations and as an aggressive action inconsistent with General Denikin&apos;s desire to come to an agreement on other questions. The Azerbaijan Government, therefore,, protested against the demand and would keep its fleet under its own national flag.. Georgia and General Denikin. On 28th October Mr. Wardrop reported [No. 96]&apos; that he had been informed by the- Georgian Foreign Minister that his Government was sending   a   mission to General Denikin, with the object of resuming the negotiations, which had been begun with General Baratov, and bringing about a complete settlement between itself and the General.Azerbaijan and Armenia. See under Armenia [page 2].Proclamation by General Rowlanason.- On 29lh October Mr. Wardrop reported [No. 100] the receipt of a communication from the Azerbaijan Government in regard to a proclamation in which General Rowlandson had clearly stated that General. Denikin was supported by Great Britain and that his object was the restoration of an undivided Russia. This j)roclamation had, the Government said, created a most painful impression, and it asked how ;far it corresponded with the views of Bis Majesty&apos;s Government. On 5th November Lord Curzon informed [No. 70] Mr. Wardrop that he had had no confirmation of the alleged proclamation which did not represent the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government,CHINA.Supply of Arms to Tibet.  On 23rd October Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 152] lo Sir John Jordan informing him that the Government of India had been requested not to allow arms to be supplied to Tibet, as His Majesty&apos;s Government had arrived at the conclusion that do so would be a direct violation of the new Arms Traffic-Convention.CZECHOSLOVAKIA.Relations with the Soviet Government. The following Avireless message was sent from Moscow to the Czecho-Slovak Red Cross at Prague by Mr. Chicherin on 1st November : The Soviet Government only permit the entry of representatives of foreign Governments and organizations into Russia on the basis of reciprocity. They will welcome your request with enthusiasm if delegates of the Russian Red Cross are permitted to reside in Bohemia in order to study the condition of the-muiuerous Russian prisoners of war and civilians there.DENMARK.The Scandinavian Seamen s Union. Telegraphing from Copenhagen on 1st November [No. 1609], Mr. Grant Watson reported that on 25th and 26th October a Conference of the Scandinavian Seamen&apos;?. Union held at Copenhagen decided to oppose a blockade of Soviet Russia by all possible means. The Scandinavian unions will invite the British Seamen&apos;s Union to press Bis Majesty&apos;s Government to raise the blockade, and they will urge their respective Scandinavian Governments to influence the Allies in the same sense.If the Scandinavian Governments refuse to carry out the wishes of the Seamen&apos;s-Union a further conference will be stunmoned to consider the situation.
- --FINLAND.Request lor Finnish Intervention in Russia. Telegraphing from Helsingfors [No. 593! on 27th October, Sir Coleridge Kennard transmitted the following trans-lation ol General Goulevitclfs communication conveying General Yuclenich&apos;s request to the Finnish Government for Finnish intervention in Russia: General Yudenich, . has instructed me by telegraph to inform the Finnish Government that he would be very much pleased if the Finnish Government would decide on military co-operation with the Russian troops against the Bolsheviks and take part in the struggle against the common enemy.Telegraphing again on 1st November [No. 621], he transmitted the text of the reply which the Government was about to make to General Yudenich :  Tlie Finnish Government, which is filled with sincere sympathy for the efforts of the Government of North-West Russia to deliver Petrograd from Bolshevism, is doing its.best to furnish all possible economic aid with a view to alleviating the conditions of the inhabitants of Petrograd.Hearing in mind, however, the interior political situation in Finland, the weakness of the country&apos;s finances, and the uncertainty of obtaining war material; bearing in mind also the fact that the Entente Governments have not given Finland sufficient guarantees that the Russian Government of the future will recognize her. independence and agree to certain conditions (considered by her to be reasonable), which have been communicated to the Peace Conference and to the Government of North-West Russia, the Finnish Government regrets that it is impossible to agree to General Yudenich&apos;s proposal relative to Finland, apart from co-operation to deliver Petrograd.Foreign Relations. On 31st October Sir Coleridge Kennard telegraphed [No. 6l8] the following summary of the Governments pronouncement to the Diet on foreign relations : The Government was of opinion that Bolshevism ought to be fought, but only in conformity with the means at the country&apos;s disposal. The negotiations at Dorpat were compatible with Finland&apos;s interests : Fiuland&apos;s position as a wall against Bolshevism had not been weakened but strengthened thereby. The Russian forces fighting against the Soviet had shown weakness and lack of co-operation ; the north-west army had suffered, defeat; the Entente had taken no drastic measures against Bolshevism ; the border States, especially Esthonia, were depleted of resources and willing to negotiate for peace: there were no positive guarantees, either financial, or military, from the Entente ; and a powerful party in Finland, the Social Democrats, desired peace. In these circumstances the Government had endeavoured to prevent the thoughtless opening of peace negotiations, and to gain time until the situation -cleared in regard to (I) the position of Bolshevism, and (2) the Entente&apos;s attitude in regard to a continuation of the struggle against the Bolsheviks. The importance of the Baltic States for the settlement of the Baltic problem was so great that it occupied the attention of the Great Powers ; therefore Finland could not be indifferent to what happened in the Baltic States. Finland would continue to be a wall against the westward spread of Bolshevism and would act in agreement with the policy of the Entente Powers.Commenting on this in another telegram of the same date [No. 619], Sir Coleridge Kennard said that the Government majority had made it clear that the desire for intervention was restricted to the 11 Extreme Right voters.ITALY.The h mine. Situation.-Siv Or. Buchanan telegraphing from Rome on 26th October [No. 674] recounted a conversation with Signor Tittoni, in which the latter reviewed the whole question, and after pointing out on the map the territory which it was proposed should be ceded to Italy declared that his latest proposal was the least concession that would satisfy public opinion in Italy, and would make it possible to eliminate ITAnnuuzio. To the objection that if the frontiers of Italy and Fiume were to be made conterminous, it might be interpreted as a preliminary to eventual annexation of Fiume by Italy, Signor Tittoni replied that in order to remove such an apprehension, he had informed the United States Government that he would have no objection to the territory in question being neutralized. He admitted the political and economical advantages to be gained by friendly relations with the Jugo-Slavs, but apprehended a constant source of friction, if not of conflict, in the future, if the -Fiume question Avere left unsolved.3-1 B
On the following day, 27th October, Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 675] the-translation of a telegram addressed by the President of the Council to Mr. Lansing,, in which the following passages occur : &quot; Is it possible that anyone in America can believe that we covet this small miserable strip of land from territorial ambition ? No territory would compensate us for the terrible moral and material damage which is caused by the present situation. But we are obliged to ask for this strip because otherwise the Italian people would be convinced that we had betrayed Fiume, and that Fiume would be bereft of its independence. These sentiments are the same as those which made Belgium a sacred., question in Italy.&quot;&quot; Over and above the immense interest. that you share with us that peace and order should reign in Italy and in the East, there has arisen for you to-day a new high moral duty, and of recognising the proportion which exists between the new question and of preventing Italy (which for four/years has given all its blood to the-Allies) from being destroyed.&quot;&quot; I confess to you, Mr. Lansing, that the matter is the following : if moral order is not established here immecliatelv, I have no illusions as to the grave situation of Italy.&quot; . :In a later telegram [No. 676] of. the same date, Sir G. Buchanan reported that in. handing him a copy of the telegram referred to above, Count Sforza remarked that Italy was asking for a helping hand to save her from threatened destruction. The fleet, he said, was out of control, and the army was in sympathy with D&apos;Annunzio and was not to be relied on. It was impossible to foretell what might. hapj)en if Signor TittonPs proposed solution of the question were rejected.Continuing on the 27th October [No: 677] Sir George telegraphed that he-had learned that the United States Government had rejected Signor TittonFs pro-posals, and pointed out the disastrous effect Avhich this rejection might have on the-internal and diplomatic situation in Italy, as well as the external complications which it might bring about,. On 29th October Sir G. Buchanan reported [No. 679] the efforts of the President, of the Council, addressed to Sir George and to the French Charge d&apos;Affaires, to urge on the British and French Governments the importance of taking action at Washing-ton to induce a reconsideration of the United States Governments attitude, and further to bring pressure to bear on the Jugo-Slavs with a view of their coming to a friendly understanding with Italy about Fiume and similar questions.With reference to this report Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 680] on the same-date as follows ; &quot; An article appears in the ministerial organ Messagero to-day expressing an appreciation of the reception given to General Diaz in London, and emphasizing the bonds of friendship which have existed and must exist in future between -Italy and England. It then enquires how it is that England with her sense of justice and friendship for Italy does not support her in her present dilemma.&quot; It seems to be inferred by the Italian Press generally that the present difficulty of finding a satisfactory solution of the Fiume question is entirely clue to the United States Government, and surprise is expressed that the interests of Europe generally should be entirely subordinated to the personal views of President Wilson and his- , advisers.&quot;On 31st October Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 683] the views of the Minister of Marine that the solution of the Fiume question in favour of Italy was essential in order to escape revolution. The abandonment of Fiume would cause the breaking up of the country.Telegraphing from Paris on 1st November [No. 1511] Sir Eyre Crowe reported a conversation with Mr. Polk representing the United States Government, who said that his difficulty was that the Italians had never put their proposals in tangible form. Nothing had been forthcoming in reply to his repeated requests for some precise text which had been promised. Meanwhile, the Italians insisted on continuing-conversations on the basis of their vaguely adumbrated demands. -Mr. Polk then explained that the essential demand of the Italian Government Avas that for the coast strip connecting Italian Istria with Fiume. This aa*as quite unacceptable, Mr. Polk communicated the gist of a telegram he had received from the State Department, Avhich enumerated the important concessions successively made to Italy by President,
Wilson and recalled the fact that on every occasion the concession offered had become the starting point for a fresh Italian demand. The President and the State Department were now quite determined to put a stop to this series of concessions. Mr. Polk was instructed to make an earnest appeal to the British and French Delegations to stand together in this matter. He was convinced that the only course open to the three Allies was to inform the Italian Government that they were united in refusing to give way to Italy&apos;s entirely unjustified demands.JAPAN.Ratification of the Treaty of Peace. Telegraphing from Tokio on 30th October [No. 429], Mr. Alston reported that the Treaty of Peace had been ratified, that day - by the Emperor of Japan.MEXICO.British Grievances.- On 29th October and 3rd November Lord Curzon telegraphed [Kos. 23S and 240] to Mr. Cummins in regard to the grievances of His Majesty&apos;s Government against the present Mexican Government, instructing him that he must explain to the Sub-Secretary that the chief of them related to the non-settlement of claims for compensation in respect of losses clue to acts of violence, to the restriction of the right to obtain visas to enter Mexico to British subjects resident in that country, and to the sequestration of British property without any provision for adequate compensation.POLAND.Provisional Economic Agreement with Germany. On 29th October Sir Horace Rumbold reported [\To. 36-5] that according to the Polish Telegraphic Agency a provisional Economic Agreement had been signed between Poland and German)- on the following terms : 1. Poland will send to Germany its surplus production of potatoes, .... a certain quantity of fodder, molasses, and spirits; 100,000 geese, and 7,200 cisterns of petroleum. 2. Germany will send coal to Poland, the quantity to depend on the output in upper Silesia, the minimum being 75,O0O tons per month .... Germany will supply rolling stock for the transport of coal. Besides these quantities Poland will obtain from upper Silesia 50,000 tons for which she will have to send her own rolling stock. After the handing over to Poland of the territories provided for in the Peace Treaty, Germany will allocate to Poland a corresponding quantity of coal for these territories. 3. Germany will sell to Poland 1,000 tons of nitric artificial manures and seeds.5. Passenger and goods traffic will be opened on [certain named] lines.6. Telegraphic communication on [certain named] lines will also be resumed.7. Germany will send to Poland 30,000 goods trucks, 130 passenger carriagesand 100 locomotives, which will become the property of Poland after the ratification of Peace.In another telegram [No. 366] Sir Horace Rumbold said that he understood that these, terms were correct in substance, but the President of the Council had informed him that the agreement as it stood could not be ratified. The Polish Commission appeared to have gone further than was intended, but the President told him that they were instructed to get coal at any price.Relations with Latvia and Lithuania. On 23rd October Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 318] that he had received a visit from the Latvian Foreign Minister, who said that he had come to Warsaw to sound the Polish Government as to their willingness to give the 1 .etts some military equipment and to recognize the Govern-ment of Latvia. He also said that he particularly wished to know the intentions of the Polish Government in regard to Lithuania, more especially the Lithuanian territory then occupied by Polish troops.In regard to the last point he stated that General Pilsudski had told him the recent arrest of Poles was a bar to the initiation of negotiations between Poland and Lithuania ; to which the Latvian Minister had replied that he believed the Lithuanians
were prepared to. release those Poles against whom, there was no . evidence of con-spiracy. General Pilsudski had then said that if this were done he would at once enter into negotiations with the Lithuanians, not only in regard to the matters in dispute, but.also in regard to common co-operation against the Russo-German forces.As to the other two points, the.Polish Government had agreed to recognize the de facto Government in Latvia and the latter might obtain some help in military equipment.ROUMANIA,Relations with the Allies. In a despatch from Bucharest dated 8th October Mr. Rattigan draws attention to the serious aspect of the relations between Roumania and the Allies, arising from an atmosphere of suspicion which has been created by a chain of extraneous circumstances &quot;which, obscure the main issue. In his opinion Roumania is the chief element of order upon which we can rely to cany out our policy in the Near East. He has little doubt that Roumania can be relied on to resist any Bolshevik wave, either from the East or the West. If the above is con-ceded, Mr. Rattigan considers that we should try to do everything in our power to conciliate her, and prevent her from breaking away from the Allies. She would then develop into the outpost of Western civilization against the disruptive tendencies of Bolshevism. Mr. Rattigan holds the view that the difficulties attendant on many of the questions which have arisen are capable of adjustment if handled with tact and goodwill on both sides, while it is essential that we should exercise firmness, combined with an attitude of friendliness, in our relations with the Roumanians. He suggests that the whole question of our policy towards Roumania should be examined from the standpoint of her importance to us as the representative of law and order in that part of the world.The Peace Treaty with Austria. On 26th October Mr. Rattigan telegraphed from Bucharest [No. 475] as follows : General Coancla replaces Mr. Misu as first delegate to Paris. The Roumanian reply to the Conference Mote of 5th October is not yet finished, but I learn on very good authority that it is approximately to the following effect: Roumania is prepared to sign the Peace Treaty with Austria without reserve.   With regard, however, to the actual treaty she points out: 1. That having declared her readiness to extend the fullest, rights to foreign minorities she is ready to accept the provisions of Article 60, provided they only take effect in regard to definite infractions of the right of minorities, which naturally applies in the case of all members of the League of Nations.2. She accepts in principle the control of requisitions.3. The proposed examination of the question of abuses by an Allied Corn-mission cannot be accepted ; but Roumania guarantees full public examination by her own military authorities.4. Roumania will ask for the reconsideration of her demands in regard to certain frontier modifications, e.g., the confluence of Maros river.RUSSIA.The Bolsheviks. The following notes were prepared by the Intelligence Division of the Naval Staff : -In connexion with the military disasters on the front, the political and economic situation has become very much worse for the Bolsheviks. All their hopes of getting the harvest from the peasants in return for manufactured goods have been destroyed by the action of General Mamontoff, whose troops have seized all the goods stored near Moscow and handed them out to the peasants.All the committees formed on the territory abandoned by Admiral Ivolchak are unanimous in refusing to give food excepting in return for manufactured goods in spite of all the appeals addressed to them by the Central. Food Control. Besides this, the transfer of food to the centres is becoming steadily more and more difficult owing to the cutting of the railway lines by Mamontoff, the extreme shortness- of fuel supplies and the very small number of sound engines and railway cars.....   Inconnection with the absence of proper food, equipment and ammunition supplies, the relations of the Red soldiers to.the Soviet GJovernment. are becoming Avorse and worse. The only means by which the Soviet get anything done is terror, an excellent agitation service and the indecision of.the White troops opposing the Red Army.
The sailors are mostly indifferent to political events, being engrossed for the most part in questions of pay and the formation of &quot;foraging parties&quot; into thecountry. *The attitude of the workers and of the Avhole population is extremely anti-Bolshevik.   The higher circles of the Soviet Government, fully realizing all these-factors are fully aware of the critical position in which they are now placed.   The only move which will enable them to gain some sort of breathing-space, they consider, is the peace which they are offering to their enemies at the present moment.Tlie number of persons working in White organizations is steadily diminishing, one reason for this being the system of terror which continues to be practised by the Bolsheviks, and another the bad organization and inertness of the White organiza-tions working in Esthonia and Finland. The Petrograd organizations have long-since drawn attention to the necessity for more agitation on the part of the White organizations on the other side of the border (particularly the throwing of proclamationsOlonetz has had a terrible effect on the members of the White organizations in Petrograd, and has caused a great number to leave for Denikin&apos;s front to try and join Denikin, as they considered, not without reason, that in case Petrograd were taken, the same thing might easily happen to them.All the workers in White organizations remaining in Petrograd earnestly request that the work of throwing down proclamations from aeroplanes maybe taken.up at once, and that the work of those in the employ of the Eed Government may be looked into before they are shot, particularly as all real Bolsheviks are already listed and will hardly be able to escape their fate if retribution is meted out in an organized and methodical manner.2. A report from an agent, dated 30th September, says :  Information&apos; has been received from Petrograd from a very reliable source containing some interesting statistics lately compiled by the White Officer, organiza-tions under the direction of the National Centre. According to this information at the present moment the Eed Army is composed as to 70 cent, of its total strength of men absolutely against Bolshevism ; a further 20 per cent, do not wish to fight on the one side or the other, and only 10 per cent, are in favour of the Soviet Government of which 10 per cent,, only o per cent, are Communists proper.The feeling against the Bolsheviks is tremendous ; the working class is being persecuted as severely as any other. The sender of the information from Petrograd states that he himself saw a group of about 500 arrested led along the Nevsky in Petrograd of whom SO per cent, were workmen. The group was being convoyed by mounted Letts.The Chinese in the Reel Army have refused to shoot, arrested men. It is not known definitely whether this refusal is due to skilful iDropaganda or whether a letter from the spiritual authorities in China has really been received, but report states that the Dalai Llama has sent a letter forbidding the Chinese to shoot unarmed men, and recalling his followers from Russia back to their own country, and the fact remains that the Chinese have passed a resolution, refusing to take part, - in the executions of arrested men.   For this reason there have been fewer executions lately.In order to save the situation the Soviet authorities have formed a detachment of Bashkirs and Kalmucks to the strengths of about 1,500 men, which detachment has agreed to undertake the executions ordered by the Soviet and the guarding of all persons directly forming the Soviet Government. It was this detachment of 1,500 &quot; Bed Bashkirs&quot; that Trotsky threatened to send against Finland, only he exaggerated the figure, stating that it numbered 10,000 men.The Omsk Government.-On 23rd October Mr. 0&apos;Reilly reported [No. S6S] from Vladivostock that General Kreshchititski had called upon him and spoken at consider-able length of matters relating to the Omsk Government. He said that though at. one time the prevailing spirit at Omsk had been reactionary and Germanophile, the. Government now realized that the help and recognition of the Allies was&quot; essential to their success and the influence of General Golovin had brought Admiral Kolchak and General Dietrichs to favour more liberal courses. The Admiral was now, General Kreshchititski said, determined to make the new assembly entirely elective and also a legislative body, and so to establish on this basis a democratic provisional Siberian 3-1 C
Government. The General also said that it was now recognized that the dismissal of General Horvat was a mistake, and after a decent interval he wordd be reinstated.NoHh-West^Government. Telegraphing from Reval on 25th October [No. 326] Air. Bosanqnet reported that General Yridenich had.appointed a Governor-General of the reoccupiecl districts in the person of General Glasenapp.Tho Czech Troops in, Siberia. Telegraphing from Prague on 20th October [No. 121 (sic) j Mr. Gosling reported that he had been informed by the President, of the Czecho-Slovak Republic that, though one or two regiments might have gone over to the Bolsheviks, it was not true that the leaders of the Czech troops were working for the overthrow of Admiral Kolchak&apos;s Government, he would, however, renew their instructions to abstain from any such action.Turkestan.Conditions in Tashkent.
