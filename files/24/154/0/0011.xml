FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Situation in Kabul. On 18th February the Viceroy reported that the dominant note of the present Kabul policy appeared to be the &quot; unity of all Mohamedan &quot; (sic) ; the situation there, was normal, and there was no appearance of military activit)&apos;.THE BALTIC STATES.Lithuanians and the Bolsheviks. Telegraphing from Riga on 16th February [No. 46], Mr. Dewhurst reported that he had been informed by the Lettish Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Lithuanians would not be taking part in the Conference with the Bolsheviks, proposed to be held in the middle of March at Petrograd or Moscow, unless a promise was given by Polish White Russia to refrain from annexing any purely Russian territory. The Finns, Letts and Lithuanians were agreeable to Poland taking part in the above-mentioned Conference.Proposed Joint Peace Conference.- On 13th February Lord Acton reported [No. 184] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed the Latvian Government that Finland would deprecate a separate peace between Latvia and Soviet Russia, as it will jeopardize her military position. She would, however, advocate a simultaneous peace between the four outstanding Baltic States and the Soviet Government.Telegraphing again [No. 194] on 19th February, he reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that the Government was in a difficult position in regard to making a joint peace with Soviet Russia. The Latvian Government had asked the Finnish Government to send a representative early in March to a Conference at Riga between Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, convened to discuss the peace question, and the Finnish Government were disposed to accept the invitation.Telegraphing again [No. 200] on 21st February, he said that Finland would be represented by the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs at this Conference, which would meet.at Warsaw and not at Riga as at first proposed.A later telegram from Colonel Tallents at Riga [No. 59] says that, though the Poles had asked for the Conference to take place at Warsaw, neither the Letts nor the Lithuanians would agree to its doing so.Esthonia and Soviet Russia. On 14th February the Deputy Commissioner at Reval re/ported [No. 9] that the Treaty of Peace with Soviet Russia had been ratified by the Esthonian Constituent Assembly on the previous day. * f.:CHINA.The Proposed Loan. On 4th February [No. 55] Sir John Jordan telegraphed the following text of a communication which the representatives of the four Powers had agreed to make to the Chinese Government regarding the conditions of the proposed loan of 5,000,000Z. :-In order to meet the urgent requirements of the Chinese Government, the representatives of Great Britain, France, North America and Japan would be prepared to cause the issue by a group of banks of their four countries of a loan of about 5,000,000Z. or its equivalent on the following; conditions :  (1) That the loan should be secured on&apos;the salt revenue and such other revenue or revenues as may be agreed upon between the Chinese Government and ,the group of banks.(2) That negotiations between the North and the South should be resumed without delay.(3) That the Chinese Government should begin the disbandment of unnecessary troops on both the Northern and the Southern sides, and should employ a portion of the proceeds of the present loan for that purpose.(4) That the four Governments and the four banking groups should effectively supervise the application of the proceeds of the loan and the disbandment of the unnecessary troops.
The Position at Macao. On 9th February Mr. Jamieson, Consul-General at Canton, reported [No. 2] that he had suggested to thePortuguese representative a compromise on the following lines: The Governor of Macao would continue the execution of the project, as outlined, within what he conceived to he the traditional Portuguese territorial waters, on the understanding that all works should he unconditionally surrendered to China in the event of the Portuguese position being-declared untenable by the Commission. He would be prepared to open, negotiations for a revision of the extradition regulations and to recommend his Government to -accept such revision; and he would also release Chinese national vessels from, the port formalities which had been obligatory. He Avould ask for the immediate appointment of a boundary commission with full powers.On 20th February Lord Curzon informed Mr. Jamieson [No. 3] that the Portuguese Minister had stated&apos;.that his Government were instructing, the Governor to resume works which were indispensable, confining himself to the zone which had always been recognized as directly subject to Portugal, and to adhere to the 1900 Agreement in matters relating to the inner harbour. Lord Curzon also said that the Portuguese Government were being urged to accept the suggested compromise and to telegraph their acceptance to the Governor.GERMANY.The Plebiscite Area in Silesia. Telegraphing from Oppeln on 17th February [No. P. 1], Colonel Percival reported that complete agreement existed among the Allied Commissioners, that all the officials of the Allied Administrations Were working-together harmoniously, and that the general situation continued to be satisfactory.Polish Extradition Demands.-A wireless message from Norddeicb, ,dated 18th February, states that the German Government protest against the Polish extradition demands, because they are contrary to the formal Polish renunciation of 1st October 1919.   They must, therefore, be absolutely rejected on legal grounds.Undesirable Immigrants. It is reported by a wireless message from&apos; Norddeich, dated 19th February, that the Grovernment are considering the creation of special settlements for all undesirable aliens coming from Poland, Russia, &amp;c. Recently about 30,000 to 40,000 Jews entered the country from the East, as neighbouring -countries have refused them permission to repass their frontiers without passports. To overcome the serious difficulty created thereby, the German Government desire to negotiate with their states of origin about their deportation on the basis of mutual exchange.Negotiations loiih the Soviet Government. In a telegram [No. 80] dated 24th February, Lord Kilmarnock reported that the Minister for Foreign A if airs had informed him that negotiations with the Soviet Government were to be restricted to the question of prisoners of war. He had heard that the Soviet representative would be glad to extend them to commercial matters and is making statements to the Press with a view to spreading that idea just at Litvinoff has clone in Copenhagen. When Radek was in Berlin he managed to excite the interest of commercial circles in the possibility of trade with Russia, and some firms are sending representatives there to examine the question.Measures for the Trial of War Criminals. Lord kilmarnock telegraphed [No. 81] from Berlin on 24th February that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had taken an opportunity that day of telling him that he was engaged in consultations with the Minister of Justice as to the measures necessary to provide for the trial of war criminals. A Bill will be laid before the National Assembly immediately on its. reaching Assembly on 26th Februarj7 dealing with the following four points:--(!) The abolition of the amnesty which is at present in force ; (2) the suspension of statutory limitations ; (3) the provision that persons who have already been tried may be brought to trial again ; (4) the provision that cases may not be quashed by the Public Prosecutor in the preliminary stages, but must come before the court. It was necessary to deal with these matters, which would otherwise conflict with existing German laws.HOLLAND.The League of Nations.-*-On 20th February Sir Ronald Graham reported [No. 49] that on the previous clay the BiR authorizing- adherence to the League of Nations had been passed by the Second Chamber by 59 votes to 5.
HUNGARY.: The Western Counties [F.C.R., x., p. 2].-Telegraphing from Vienna [No. 77] on 14th February, Mr. Lindley reported that the Hungarian Minister had addressed a Note to the Austrian. Government to the following effect: The Hungarian Government, fearing that the stipulation contained in both the Treaty of St: Germain and the draft treaty to be concluded with Hungary, whereby Austria shall annex parts of Western Hungary, will, in case of its execution, cause perpetual discord between the two countries, and wishing not only to maintain the friendly relations existing between Austria and! Hungary, but also to (? strengthen) them, in the interest of both countries has charged the Hungarian Minister to make an official proposal to the Austrian Government with a view to the solution of the question of the future of Western Hungary&apos;&apos; by means of a friendly understanding and on a (? new basis) (? wherein) the Hungarian Government is ready (to renounce ?) its historical rights, dating back for more than 1,000 years, to the territory in question, and &quot;to leave it to the population to decide whether the territories shall belong to Austria or to Hungary. The Hungarian Government is also ready to give the necessary guarantees to enable the population of the territory concerned to express its own will without interference from any side. If the Austrian Government makes a similar declaration the Hungarian Government undertakes to consider the result of the plebiscite as definite.As Austria bases the necessity for the annexation of Western Hungary on strategic, national and economic reasons, the Hungarian Government declares its readiness to safeguard Austiian interests in a constitutional way ; that is to say, bv means of stipulations to be agreed upon and carried out even in the event of the population of the Western counties deciding to remain with Hungary. Consequently, the Hungarian Government is disposed (1) To limit the strength of the armed forces in the territory &quot;mentioned to anumber indispensable for the maintenance of order. (2) To grant to the German population of Western Hungary extensive autonomy for self administration and for the safeguarding of its German national . character.- (3) To settle the future economic relations between Hungary and Austria on the basis of mutual and absolutely free commercial intercourse, making it possible for Austria to base her economic needs not only on the Western Hungarian strip of territory but upon the whole of Hungary. (4) Should this free commercial intercourse cease in the distant future, to find ways and means of guaranteeing all those economic interests which Austria -seeks to obtain by the annexation of Western Hungary.After reminding the Austrian Government of (group undecypherable) which it so resolutely maintained at St. Germain, that territorial questions should only be solved in accordance with the wishes of the population concerned and not by annexation pure and simple, the Hungarian Government expresses the hope that its proposal, which arises from a desire for permanent friendly relations with Austria, will find a willing ear. The Hungarian Minister concludes his communication by inviting the Austrian Government to enter into negotiations, in the course of which the Hungarian Government intends to throw a clearer light on its proposals.Telegraphing again on the 18th and 20th February [Nos. 84- and 88], Mr. Lindley reported as follows : On 18th February the Hungarian Note was discussed in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly. All parties agreed that no official reply should be given until the Hungarian Treaty of Peace was signed. It was further unanimously decided that the question should be debated in the National Assembly and that no plebiscite was of any value until the Hungarian Administration had been withdrawn.The view of the State Chancellor was that Hungary must accept the stipulations of the Austrian Treaty of Peace and that Western Hungary should enjoy under Austria the same autonomy as other provinces. When a Provincial Assembly had been elected it should be allowed to. decide whether a plebiscite should be taken or not.      .      ...As regards freedom of trade with Hungary, experience during the war has made the Vienna people sceptical as to its advantages, and there is some doubt whether Hungary will haAre any surplus foodstuffs to export within a measurable time.   The
State Chancellor stated, however, that he was ready to discuss the question apart from that of. Western Hungary.On the following day the Note was discussed in the National Assembly. At the end of the debate the State Chancellor summed up by saying that all parties were agreed to abide by the Peace Treaty and that the plebiscite was a question to be decided between Austria and Western Hungary and did not concern the Hungarian Govern-ment. The district would be given the status of an Austrian province and would have its own Provincial/Assembly, which -would have to decide regarding a plebiscite and to carry it out if accepted. &apos; -On 21st February he reported [No. 93] that the official reply of the Austrian Government to the Hungarian Note had been published :. After referring to the importance of West Hungary for Austria and especially Vienna, the Austrian Government declare that they consider the Treaty of Peace as the foundation, of their State. They cannot make the German population of West Hungary an object of barter for economic advantages. The Austrian Government have every intention of respecting the right of the district to settle its own destiny and intend to give it the same standing : as other Austrian provinces, with a local Assembly elected by free, universal, and proportionate suffrage. The Austrian Government are reacby to enter into negotiations at once&quot; with the Hungarian Government for carrying out the Austrian Treaty of Peace.As regards the offer of free trade, the Austrian Government state that in the present circumstances the chief hindrance to trade is not so much the customs duties as the export and import licences. They are ready to enter into negotiations at once for abolishing the latter and also for establishing business on the basis of reciprocal free trade for a period of five years as allowed by the Treaty Peace. They are willing to do this on all their frontiers. -Mr. Lindley added that it was with some deference that he submitted the opinion that any changes in the territorial dispositions of the Austrian Treaty of Peace worn calculated rather to prolong the present disastrous feeling of uncertainty than to improve the situation. On the other hand, a considerable step forward would be achieved if the Hungarian Government could see their way to accepting the Austrian economic proposals quite apart from the territorial questions.In a previous telegram [No. 101, 16th February] he had reported that the Italian member of the Inter-allied Millitary Mission had expressed the following views in conversation : While it is probable enough that portions of the western counties are Austrian in race, language, and sympathy, it is certain that the major part is not, but is absolutely adverse to its, to them alien, rule, f&quot;Consequently, when the act of cession takes place there will be great popular discontent which will find anoutletindisturbanc.es and risings. To check these a well-organized and numerous force will be required. But Austria now possesses only a national guard, which is incompetent for the task. He thinks therefore that, despite the doubtless genuine statements of Dr. Renner that his Government has no intention, of granting the country to&apos;the Czechs, Austria will be driven to ask for the help of Czecho-Slovakia, her most friendly neighbour, to. provide the occupying force, and he considers that this could only lead to further discord and. grave danger. The only remedy he can see is the adoption of a careful plebiscite, which would, assign to either country respectively those sections which really want it, unless the rest of the Allies send troops to assist the Inter-allied -Military Mission.These views, Mr. Hohler adds, are entirely shared by the French and British Generals.The Czecho-Slovaks and the Ceded Territories. On 19th February Air. Hohler reported from Budapest [No. 109] that the Hungarian Government complained that the Czecho-Slovak authorities, contrary to the rules of war and to the draft of the Peace Treaty, which provided that persons in the territories to be ceded shall have a year in which to decide which nationality they would adopt, were forcing Hungarian subjects to declare themselves Czecho-Slovak. Their action in the town of Rimaszonbat was specially mentioned. The Hungarian Government solicited intervention to prevent this being d.one.Evacuation [F.C.R., x., p. 8].--On 20th February Mr. Hohler reported from Budapest [No. 118] as follows : Assurances that evacuation is being proceeded with have so far been erroneous. The reasons for deferring action would appear to be, first, the wintry weather and the 10-4 B
lack of food and fuel; socondly, the necessity for evacuating all Rumanian and Czecho-Slovak nationals, for which it is stated at least two months will he required -and thirdly, the necessity for holding on to certain strategic points on account of the ferocity of the Hungarians.Mr. Mainu is incorrectly informed as to the numbers of the Huno-arian Armv the total of which is 25,000. 0        &apos; &apos;   ^No violent speeches have been made by the Hungarian leaders except Friedrich and he has been silent for at least six weeks, having been strongly suppressed  and being now entirely discredited.A Rumanian officer has just arrived here to treat with the Inter-allied Military Mission as to the method of&apos;evacuation. His proposals are very unsatisfactory from the point of view of the protection of the population.Evacuation and the Jeios. Telegraphing on 15th February [No. 99], Mr. Hohler reported that the Hungarian Government were very apprehensive lest riots against the Jews.should take place in Debreczen between the time of evacuation bv the Rumanians and that of occupation by the Hungarian regular troops, because the Jews were on very intimate terms with the Rumanians, who had behaved harshlv to the population.They earnestly hoped that it might be possible to arrange for the presence of an Inter-allied Commission there at this moment, and that, if possible, evacuation and occupation should be simultaneous,Relations with Styria.-Telegraphing on 17th February [No. 82], Mr. Lindley pointed out that the relations between the Provincial Government of Styria and the Hungarian Government were more friendly than those existing between the former and the Central Government at Vienna. The Hungarian-Styrian frontier, for instance, was as open as it was before the break-up of the Monarchy, whereas Styrian guards prevented free intercourse with Lower Austria. It appeared, in fact, probable that the Hungarians were working to persuade Styria to opt for union with Hungary in the event of Austria breaking up.In regard to this Mr. Hohler telegraphed [No. 123] from Budapest on 21st February as follows : -I found an opportunity to question the Prime Minister as well as Admiral Horthy on this point. They both severally told me that some months ago there had been talk of the cession to Hungary, not only of Styria, but of considerable further portions of Austria should A7ienna come under Bolshevik rule, but that this talk had been confined to irresponsible politicians and that the Hungarian Government had never lent itself in any way to such a movement.Admiral Horthy told me he had even received an invitation to attend a meeting close to the frontier to discuss it, but had refused to participate in any way.Their statements agreed entirely and bore every apparent trace of genuineness.Relations with Croatia.-Qn 17th February Mr. Lindley reported [No. 82] that he had learnt that Graz, the capital of Styria, was the centre of an active Italo-Hungarian intrigue having for its object the detaching of Croatia from the Serb-Croat-Slovene&apos;State and making it an autonomous unit of (? Hungary). This information, Mr. Lindley said, had come from a well-informed source.PERSIA.Bolshevik Tactics. The Viceroy of India on 16th February transmitted a telegram, from General Malleson, in which he said that the capture of Krasnovodsk had greatly increased Bolshevik prestige with the Persians. Now that this problem was out of the way it did not appear to be the intention of the Bolsheviks to employ armed force against Persia, but to revert to their former plan of first sending in swarms of Persian agitators. These wordd be supplemented from time to time by Persians now serving in the Bolshevik ranks, the object of this being to bring about armed risings in Khorasan, whereby the inhabitants would be brought into conflict with the British, and so afford the Bolsheviks an excuse for armed intervention.POLAND.Visit- of Marshal Foch to Warsaw.-On 16th February Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed [No. Ill] that he understood that Marshal Foch was coming to Warsaw
very shortly. His arrival could not fail to be interpreted,in the same manner both by the public in Poland and by &quot;the. Bolsheviks. Both the. Poles and the Bolsheviks were likely to infer that serious military operations&quot; were contemplated in the near future. Whilst this might have an unsettling. effect, on public opinion m Poland^the Polish Government would no doubt welcome the apprehension which might be caused in the minds of the Bolsheviks.      - &apos;  ; v.Negotiations for Peace with the Soviet Governments In a telegram [No. HQ] dated 16th February, Sir H. Rumbold reports as follows:  *&quot;        &quot;    - - -The Master for Foreign Affairs tells me that he is&quot; engaged in^drafting the conditions on which the Polish Government are willing to negotiate peace with the Soviet Government. These conditions will no doubt embody General PilsudskPs ideas. M. Patek will then submit his draft conditions to the Foreign ^Affairs Commission of the ^ Diet, and he anticipates that his draft may undergo sonic; alterations and modifications. He will subsequently submit the final /draft to the principal Allied Governments, and foresees that it may. be necessary for him to go to Paris and London in that connexion. It will thus be seen that the Polish Govem-ment mean to consult the Allied Governments before embarking&apos; ^oh definite negotiations with the Soviet Government.British. Attitude toicards Poland and the Baltic States.--By a telegram [No. 125] from the Foreign Office, dated 16th February, General Keyes at Constantinople was informed that the general attitude of the British Government towards Poland the Baltic States and Finland, was that these States had not been encouraged.to enter on offensive operations against the Bolsheviks because the stability of their internal and economic conditions was insufficient to maintain the . stress of extensive military operations. Should these States be attacked by the Bolsheviks it would be our endeavour to help them to repel the attack.PORTUGAL. \ GThe New Ministry. In his despatch [No. 21] of 21st January, Sir L: Carnegie reported the formation of a new Ministry, and in a further despatch [No. 26;, dated 25th January, he gives the names of the members as follows :  &apos; r &quot; - - n&apos;&quot;K&apos;A&apos;!-President of the Ministry and Minister of the.

sRUSSIA.Soviet Russia and the White Archangel Forces. On 20th February Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 61] to Mr. Porter at Reval&apos;a request that he would transmit the following message to M. Chicherin :  I have received from General Miller a telegram stating that the Provisional Government of the Northern Region have decided that they can no longer maintain the struggle against the Soviet Forces on the Archangel Front, and that they-, therefore, propose to surrender the town. Their intention appears to be that those&apos; who have been prominent in the Ciwl War will withdraw. General Miller has requested me to communicate the request that Avhen Archangel passes into the hands of the Soviet Government no violence will be done against the representatives or property of the population. From this message I gather that the Provisional Government would instal at Archangel an authority in sympathy with the Soviet Government,You will readily understand that, as His Maj esty&apos;s Government were for over a year in a large measure responsible for the feeding and general wed being of the population of the Northern Region, it would make a peculiarly painful impression in this country if serious disorders occurred, or severe reprisals were exercised by the Soviet authorities against the population which had resisted them for &apos; many months. If you have any proposals to make to General Miller with a view to a peaceful capitulation, and wish to make these proposals through me, I should be happy to transmit them. (Signed) Curzon ok Kedleston.To the foregoing the following reply from M. Chicherin was received by wireless on 23rd February, dated Moscow, 21st February : In answer to your radio received to-day, we request you to convey to the White Guard forces and authorities of the Northern area the following proposals :&apos; First of all, the Northern districts, which belonged to the former Russian Empire, are, without any restriction or limitation, to be delivered and given over to the Russian Soviet Government, including the Karelian and the Murmansk regions and littoral as far as the frontier which existed before the war between Russia on one side and Finland and Norway on the other.Secondly, all the Governmental and military property, including all transport means, i.e., railways, vehicles, ships, boats in general, all sea and river craft and all aerial apparatus, likewise all food, equipment, munitions and other stores and stocks, are to be delivered and given over to the Russian Soviet Government, in full, unimpaired and intact, without any damage, deterioration or destruction.Thirdly, at the moment of capitulation the troops are to deliver and give over to the Russian Soviet authorities all gross equipment and munitions they have, all property and stores in full, everything completely intact and unimpaired.Fourthly, to all officers, men employes and crews of the former so-called Northern Government and of its naval and military forces, in case they immediately and voluntarily surrender, life&apos; is to be guaranteed, and to all responsible representatives of the former so-called Northern Government and persons belonging to the Com-manding Corps of its military and naval forces, in case they immediately and voluntarily surrender, free departure from Soviet Russia to be permitted.We entertain the hope that the British Government will take the opportunity of the influence it exerts upon the Northern White Guards in order to bring to an end unnecessary effusion of blood and hopeless resistance on their part, and to reconstitute the integrity of the Russian territory in the Northern area.(Signed)      The People&apos;s Commissary for Foreign Affairs,Chiciierin.Allied Policy in Russia. On 24th February the Allied Governments agreed on the following conclusions : IFthe communities which border on the frontiers of Soviet Russia, and whqse independence or de facto autonomy they have recognized, were to approach them and to ask for advice as to what attitude they should take with regard to Soviet Russia-, the Allied Governments would reply that they cannot accept the responsibility of advising them to continue a war which maybe injurious to their own interests. Still less would they advise them to adopt a policy of aggression towards Russia. If, however, Soviet Russia attacks them inside their legitimate frontiers, the Allies will give them every possible support.
The Allies cannot enter into diplomatic relations with the Soviet Government in view of their past experiences until they have arrived at the conviction that-Bolshevik horrors have come to an end-, and that the Government of Moscow ia ready to conform its methods and diplomatic conduct to those of all civilized Governments. The British and Swiss Governments were both compelled to expel representatives of the Soviet Government from their respective countries because these had abused their privileges. Commerce between Russia and the rest of Europe, which is so essential for the improvement of economic conditions, not only in Russia, but in the rest of the world, will be encouraged to the utmost degree possible without relaxation of the attitude described above.Eurthermore, the Allies agree in the belief that it is highly desirable to obtain impartial and authoritative information regarding the conditions now prevailing in Russia. They have, therefore, noted with satisfaction the proposal before the International Labour Bureau, which is a branch of the League of Nations, to send a Commission of Investigation to Russia, to examine the facts. They think, however, that this inquiry would be invested with even greater authority, and with superior chances of success, if it were made upon the initiative, and conducted under the supervision, of the Council of the League of Nations, itself, and they invite that body to take action in this direction.Siberia.Proposed. Abolition of High Commissioner&apos;s Post. -By telegram [No. 258] from the Foreign Office, dated 19th February, Lord Derby was requested to inform the French Government-that in view of the present situation in Siberia, the British Government proposed to abolish the post of High Commissioner. Lord Derby was requested to ask whether the French Government intended to do&apos; the same.-SERBIA.Change of Ministry. On 16th February Sir Alban Young reported from Belgrade [No. 16] that as the Prince Regent had declined to accede to the proposal of the Government to, dissolve the present Provisional National Assembly and to proceed to the elections for a great Constituent Assembly under an electoral law to be promulgated by decree, M. Daviclovitch and his colleagues had, on the night of 11th February, offered their resignation, which had been accepted. ..The retiring-administration would, however, retain office until a new Cabinet had been formed.Four days later he further reported [No. 51] that M. Protich, leader of the old Radical party, had formed a party- ministiy supported by some of the smaller groups.. M. Trumbich remained titular Minister for Foreign Affairs.SPITZBERGEN.Treaty Signed. On 17th February Lord Derby reported [No. 179] that the Spitzbergen Treaty had been signed on 9th February by the United States, Denmark, France, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden ; that he had signed on 16th February on behalf of the United Kingdom and India ; that Japan, Italy and the British. Dominions had not signed, but could do so at any time up to 9th April.SWITZERLAND.League of Nations. On 17th February Mr. Russell reported from Berne [No. 27] that the President of Confederation had begged him to transmit the expression of his gratitude and that of the whole Federal Council for the generous and large-minded treatment which had been accorded to Switzerland by the Council of the League. M. Motta had assured him that from the moment he knew that the decision was to be taken in London under the aegis of Mr. Balfour, he had banished all apprehensions, as Great Britain had never failed Switzerland before, and, perhaps alone among nations, was capable 6f appreciating her present situation from its historical standpoint.The President went on to say that the Chamber would reassemble on the 25th, and would probably occupy some 10 days in revising the federal enactment of November last. In reply to his enquiry as to the probable date for the referendum, M. Motta had. expressed the hope that it might be successfully taken in the latter part of April.
-  . SYRIA.Message from Emir Feisal. -Telegraphing on 19th February [No. E.A. 2994], Colonel Meiriertzhageri reported that he had been, informed by the liaison officer, who had arrived in Cairo from Damascus, that the Emir Feisal was doing what he could to keep the country quiet, but was rapidly losing power and control in face of the extremist party. The liaison officer had brought with him a message for the Foreign Office and a letter for Lord Allenby. In the&apos; letter the Emir said that the situation was very difficult for him, and he asked for information which would enable him to make an announcement on the British policy, in regard to Mesopotamia and Palestine, before he returned to the Peace Conference. Lord&quot; Allenby had replied chat he had nothing to add to what had already been said to Emir Feisal in London. The message to the Foreign Office was to the effect that the Arabs would not acknowledge any decision concerning Palestine, Syria, and Mesopotamia which should be reached in his absence and should be incompatible with Arab aspirations, and his nation declined all responsibility for the great difficulties which would be caused in the future by such a decision.TURKESTAN.? General Kurapatkin. On 17th February the Viceroy transmitted [No. 206S] a message from General Malleson reporting that he had been informed by an agent that Kurapatkin had reached Chardjui on 21th Januaiy with an escort of Cossacks, and that in a public speech he had dwelt on the necessity of reorganizing trade and industries; had spoken highly of Turkestan; and had said that the statesmanlike attitude of Bokhara during the last two years was beyond all praise ; adding that he had been personally authorized to assure the Amir that his country should have complete independence..   [The identity of this Kurapatkin is not clear.]TURKEY.Situation in the Provinces, On 21st February Admiral de Robeck telegraphed [No. 152] that he desired to draw attention to the fact that the situation in the provinces showed signs of tension, as there had been of late noticeable military liveliness, especially among the Nationalists. He anticipated that when his communi-cation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs became generally known it would have a sedative effect. ^UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.Mr. Lansing&apos;s Dismissal.&apos; On 20th February- Mr. Lindsay reported [No. 137] that the Presidents action in dismissing Mr. Lansing was regarded as quite unbalanced and had had a most damaging effect on his position. He had not yet convened a Cabinet, a meeting of which could not now take place without him, and it was not known whether he was fit to preside over one. The chances of the Treaty were very bad, and in regard to his policy generally his loss of influence and prestige had had a very damaging effect. The Presidents followers were almost a negligible quantity in internal affairs ; but it should, be noted that any attempt to ignore his pronouncements in regard to foreign relations would be strongly resented.
