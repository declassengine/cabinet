FOREIGN  COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Jemal Pasha&apos;s Mission [F.G.R., xxxiv, p. 2], On 13th January the Viceroy of India telegraphed the substance of reports on the situation in Kabul at the end of December. It appeared that in consequence of the advent of the British mission, the Amir was beginning to find the activities of Jemal Pasha&apos;s mission somewhat embarrassing. The Amir had invariably declined to adopt, the policy, advocated by Jemal, of abetting the Indian seditionists and the frontier tribes against the British, although Jemal was prepared to finance it. Further, he had issued orders in Kabul and to the frontier officials that there must be an end to anti-British agitation. Intercourse between the maul vis, who were the Indian seditionists of JemaTs mission, and the populace of Kabul with foreigners had been prohibited during the stay of the British mission in Kabul. On the other hand, Jemal was reported to have got together a number of anti-British adherents and the influence of the Turkish and Bolshevik parties in Kabul was said to be on tbe increase.ARABIA.The Situation in Yemen. On 15th&apos; January the Resident at Aden telegraphed [No. 4] in regard to the position in Yemen, the gist of what he said being as follows : -He was of opinion that there was but little chance of peace so long as the civilian Turks, headed by Mahmud Nadbim, remained there. Every effort should be made to secure their early removal, and he was assured by Fazludclin that for this two things were necessary : a message of recall from the Turkish Government in its own cypher, and a remittance of  T. 20,U00 to pay Turkish expenses and debts. Definite orders by the Turkish Government were necessary, as the armistice terms made no conditions regarding civilians. The Resident also said that Fazluddin considered Mahmud Naclhim the evil genius of the Yemen, responsible for the propaganda against Idrisi and ourselves.AUSTRIA.The Austria-Hungarian Bank. On 17th January Mr. Lindley telegraphed [Mo. 14] from Vienna as follows : &apos;:During the war the Autria-Hungarian Bank sold a quantity of sugar to Switzer-land. Tbe Swiss Government paid but never received the sugar. They have repaid themselves in part by seizing the banlcs assets in Switzerland, and have transferred their claim for the remainder to the Czecho-Slovak Government, who in return have delivered the sugar.The Czecho-Slovak Government ceased delivery of the sugar until the bottom fell out of the market, but now claim the price fixed during the war, amounting to about 7,500,000 Swiss francs. A claim is being brought against the private banks who guaranteed payment in the original contract, and these banks are re-claiming against the Austria-Hungarian Bank. The liquidators consider that the Austria-Hungarian Bank should be allowed to pay, but not tbe whole claim which they regard as excessive. For arrangements to be made, time is required, and the British representative fears that the Czechs may meanwhile proceed against the private banks and make them bankrupt. This would be against the interests of the allied creditors, and lie therefore asked that His Maj esty&apos;s representative at Prague should use his influence to induce the Czecho-Slovak Government not to press the matter, at any rate until the present conference is over. \The Swiss mention that the Austria-Hungarian Minister of Finance complained, this morning that tbe Austria-Hungarian Bank was not allowed to settle this debt.. The bank had received payment for goods never delivered; and he thought that they should have been allowed, as a matter of course, to pass payment on as soon as the goods were delivered. It is regrettable that the Czecho-Slovak Government should have beeu given this hold over the private banks, which they may think it to their interest to bring down.   I trust Sir George Clerk may be able to do something.
BALTIC STATES.Appeal for British Capital in Latvia. Telegraphing on 12th and 19th January-&apos; JNos.&apos; 1L and 14] from Riga, Mr. Dewhurst reported two conversations with the Prime Minister in which the- latter exhorted British capitalists not to stand aloof from Latvia any longer, relaxing their demands for impossible guarantees such as the -Germans were not asking for. The country was threatened with inundation by a German industrial avalanche which it would be unable to withstand, and he desired the assistance of British not German capital. He fully realized, however, the incongruity of a declaration of welcome to British investors and the restrictive measures which had been justified by Latvia&apos;s poverty.. He was resolved to reconsider these measures with a view to relaxing such as were found to exert a crippling or deterrent influence upon foreign enterprise, The Prime Minister further mentioned an agreement with Soviet Russia providing for the return of machinery, &amp;c., evacuated from the territory now known as Latvia., THE CAUCASUS.Georgia and the Bolsheviks. Telegraphing from Tiflis on loth January [No. 12] 1 Colonel Stokes said that Georgia was on friendly terms with the Turkish Nationalists,-whom she would probably join in the event of a split between them and the: Bolsheviks, if, that was, she were unable to remain neutral. Georgia was daily giving proofs of her dislike of the,Bolsheviks, even to the extent of hampering her economic life by tbe deprivation of Baku oil ; so that it was most improbable that she would be united with them.Telegraphing again on 20th January [No. 19] Colonel Stokes reported that the local Bolshevik representative had delivered a note making certain demands - which, the Georgian Government had refused, with the full knowledge that this might lead to a rupture of diplomatic relations and would certainly entail a continued deprivation of coal. They further decided to mobilize their forces, being convinced that Georgia would be attacked, if not now, at some opportune moment. The chief demands made by the Bolsheviks were for the dismissal of the Georgian commissioner at Batum ; the release of Bolshevik agitators; and the release of recently seized Bolshevik goods. The commissioner whose dismissal was demanded had given -offence by ordering Bolshevik flags, on ships and on. shore, to be lowered.CENTRAL AMERICA.Treaty of Union. Telegraphing from San Jose [Costa Rica] on 21 st January [No. 3] Mr. Bennett reported that a treat)7 of union of the Central American republics had been signed at San Jose on 19th January by the plenipotentiaries of Guatemala, San Salvador, Honduras, and Costa Rica.   Nicaragua alone had abstained.GERMANY.German-Russian Relations. On 22nd January Lord Kilmarnock reported [No. 23] from Berlin that on the previous day the Minister for Foreign Affairs, speaking in the Reichstag on German-Russian relations, bad said : There are grave obstacles to the resumption of official diplomatic and economic relations with Russia.Firstly. Difficulties of a general nature. Russia has nothing to export. Em-power of production, has collapsed. We have no guarantee that we shall obtain any deliveries from her in return for the goods we may furnish. Communication betweeii Russia arid Germany is practically only possible by way of Poland and the border states. The Hussian transport system has completely broken clown. It is not easy for German)1- which has a capitalist sjrstem to trade wdth Russia whose economic system is communist. If we conclude a treaty with Russia now it may-be annulled later by a treaty between Russia and the Entente, under Article 117 of the treaty of; Versailles.Second^. Difficulties of special nature. Diplomatic relations cannot be resumed -until the German Government have received satisfaction for the murder of Count
Mirbach. The political propaganda carried on by tbe members and officials of the-Soviet Government who have been allowed to enter Germany, and especially Zinovieff and Losovosky, cannot be tolerated. For the present, therefore, we can only establish relations with Russia through special agents and not in the normal way. Nor can we conclude commercial treaties. But there are means of establishing relations with foreign countries other than those of formal diplomacy. The German Government have never hindered but always supported all private persons, trade unions, or other bodies who wished to enter into relations with Russia. The very considerable deliveries of goods made to the Soviet Government from Germany in the last few months were exported with the full consent of the German Government, who authorized the German firms concerned to negotiate with Russia. Germany has long been attempting without success to send a commission to Russia to study the economic-conditions there, and M. Kopp has been authorized to deal with trade questions as well as with the exchange of prisoners. We have been able to send one technical expert to Russia, and I have reason to believe that we shall be able to send more shortly. The gentleman who has been sent is intimately acquainted with Russian conditions and will work under Herr Hilger, the German prisoners-of-war com-missioner in Moscow. I hope that it will be possible to extend the system of exchange of goods between Germany and Russia, For this purpose it will be necessary, firstly, that Russia&apos;s production shall be increased ; secondly, that Russians transport system shall be improved ; thirdly, that Eastern Europe shad cease to be a constant field of battle ; and, fourthly, that the Russian Government shall give up political propaganda, in Germany7.After dealing with the shooting of several Russian Soviet prisoners in a German internment camp, Dr. Simons alluded to the efforts Avhich were being made officially in Englaud and Italy, and unofficially in France, Belgium and America, to resume trade relations with Russia, Germany should also continue to work for the restoration of normal trade relations. Matters should not be hurried on too much., Co-operation in the economic reconstruction of Russia would be found to be necessary for the reconstruction of Europe as a whole. The Russian question could not be settled without Germany7.HUNGARY.The Western Counties. The following telegram [No. 8j was sent, from Vienna by-Mr. Lindley on 11th January : The Hungarian Minister of Finance called this morning in order to beg for a delay in handing over western Hungary to Austria. He said that if the transfer took place now the Hungarian Government would- resign and no other would take its place. He was cutting down expenditure right and left, the army would be reduced to treaty7 proportions within two months, and financial equilibrium was in sight. All this work would be undone unless there were delay.He went on to say7 that in other respects the peace treaty was not being hurried. There was no sign that IItmgary7 would soon receive the territory7 belonging to her-and now occupied by7 her late enemies, the Bees district for instance, and no attempt was made to see that the minority7 clauses were observed. His own relatives had been turned out of Rumania and had been living for months in railway carriages. Could I not induce my7 Government to consent to delaydng the transfer of Western Hungary until public opinion was less excited and Hungary had received some of the benefits of the treaty7.I replied that I would report what he had said, but could promise nothing.Prom the political point of view as seen in Vienna there is no particular gain in hurrying on the transfer, and I have alway7s held that if an amicable arrangement could be come to between Austria and Hungary7 regarding the western counties it would be much better for both countries. I venture, therefore, to recommend that the transfer be left in abeyance until Hungarian public opinion has been tranquilized by7 the transfer to Hungary of tbe districts which are at present occupied by her late enemies.JAPAN.New French Minister. On 17th January Sir Charles Marling reported [No. 8]-from Copenhagen that the French Minister had informed him that he had been, appointed Ambassador to Japan.
MEXICO.The General Situation. Telegraphing from Mexico on 13th January [No. 6] Mr. Cummins said that pessimism in regard to the future was strong. The President, whose health was causing anxiety, had failed to make his personality felt. A military garrison had revolted and there had been other risings. Considerable discontent was reported, and altogether the political situation was not as satisfactory as it had promised to be.PERSIA.Retirement of British Troops [F.C.R., xxxiv. p. 5]. In a telegram [No. 20 A] dated 13th January, Mr. Norman explained that the near withdrawal of British troops had created a situation to which the Prime mini steps capacity was unequal. As a consequence, it was doubtful if he would be able to induce the deputies to attend the assemblage of the Medjliss, on account of their fear of intimidation by the Nationalists. The Prime Minister, on being pressed to exhibit more energy and to strengthen his Government, proposed to attain this result by the inclusion of Nosret-ed-Dowleh in the cabinet, as already advocated by Mr. Norman.Telegraphing [No. 41] on 19th January, Mr. Norman said ,that the General Officer Commanding Norperforce had attended a meeting of representatives of Great Britain, the United States, Belgium, France and Russia to discuss the situation caused by the withdrawal of British troops, and after a statement from the military point of view, announced the arrangements he had made for evacuating the foreign communities. It was the Generals opinion, which Mr. Norman shared, that the withdrawal would be followed by an immediate advance of the Bolsheviks on Kasvin and Teheran. He was convinced that the Soviet Government would be unable, even if willing, to prevent the advance of these troops, and that revolution would break out in the capital either before or on their arrival.Propose. Move of the Government [F.C.R., xxxiv, p. 6]. Telegraphing [No. 27] on 12th January Mr. Norman reported that the Shah had told him that, finding that most of the people whom he had consulted were opposed to the transfer of the Government to Shiraz, he had given up the idea. As, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government had refused him permission to visit Europe, and as he could not bear-to be under the constant threat of Bolshevik attack if he remained in Teheran, he had decided to abdicate, and to leave the country as a private individual.On 13th January Mr. Norman further reported [No. 28] that in spite of the persuasion of the Prime Minister, members of the Imperial family, deputies and notables, the Shah insisted on leaving the capital, while he professed indifference to the public affairs and future of the country. In the circumstances Mr. Norman was of opinion that it would be better to let him go. The Prime Minister believed that Vali Ahd, who had already been approached on the subject by the Shah, would be willing to accept the succession. This, it was thought, would offer the best solution to the difficulty.The following day, 14th January, Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 32] that the Shah had sent for his Prime Minister and had informed him, that in view of the pressure that had been brought to bear on him, he intended to delay his departure. He proposed to summon a number of ex-Ministers and to invite them to select from among themselves a Prime Minister capable of forming a popular Cabinet. On being-consulted, Mr. Norman deprecated such hasty action and suggested postponement for reflection. The Shah&apos;s sudden volte-face was stated by the Prime Minister to be due to pressure by Ain-ed-Dowleh, as representing nationalist feeling, to the effect that the welfare of the country demanded that the Persian Government should free itself from the entire domination of British influence. The Nationalists, added the Prime Minister, had recently been urging him to reduce that influence and to turn to France and the United States, who, if permitted to supply advisers and military instructors, would probably also provide money.On 15th January, Mr. Norman followed up [No. 34] the preceding telegram by saying that the Shah had personaRy confirmed his decision to him, explaining that when his intention to leave had become known, he was waited on by deputations of all classes who begged him not to go, This, said the Shah, encouraged him, because it showed that his deference to Great Britain had not made him so unpopular as he 24-4 B
supposed, and that the people realized the necessity of British help for Persia. He was now firmly resolved to remain.The Shah and the Government.-Ln the foregoing telegram Mr. Norman related that the Shah said that Sipahdar had twice resigned as Prime Minister, and had retired to his country house. He expressed himself as being strongly of the opinion that that was the moment to appoint a strong and popular Prime Minister. He was also of the opinion that the Anglo-Persian agreement should be presented as soon as possible to the Medjliss which could not fail to accept it, since British support was indispensable to Persia, and the latter must offer some advantage in exchange.Mr. Norman reported [No. 39] on 19th January that Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek had on the 16th reluctantly undertaken the formation of a Government. As, however, he stated that he would be unable to submit the Anglo-Persian agreement to the Medjliss and proposed to postpone the assembly of that body, the Shah had with-drawn from him the commission to form a Government, and suggested asking Sipahdar to resume office with a strengthened Cabinet.On 23rd January Mr. Norman reported [No. 51] that consequent on the above, tbe Shah had asked Sipahdar to resume office with a reorganized Cabinet. The latter advised the Shah to summon the deputies in order to ascertain their views. He told the Shah that if he returned to power, it was still his intention to put the Anglo-Persian agreement before the Medjliss. On 22nd January the deputies were almost unanimous in approval of SipahdaFs return, but Mr. Norman said, in spite of this, he did not anticipate that the Government would live long after the assembly of the Medjliss.POLAND.The Dispute with Lithuania.  On 14th January Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed [No. 41] from Warsaw the substance of a telegram addressed by the Polish Govern-ment to the secretary-general of the League of Nations : The Polish Government notes with satisfaction that the council of the league has decided to carry out its resolution of 28th  October  regarding a  popular consultation on the territories in dispute between Poland and Lithuania, and that the council will despatch an international detachment for police duties.   The Polish Government confirms most explicitly its complete acceptance of the resolution of 28th October and of the popular consultation ; it declares most formally and clearly that the council can count on its moral support in securing General Zeligowskbs-consent to all the steps aimed at for the disarmament, disbanclment, or withdrawal of his troops, or at the legal readjustment^of tbe administration of the territory occupied by him which the council  may consider  necessary during the consultation, to guarantee its absolute orderliness, freedom and sincerity.   On the other hand the Polish Government expects the council, while carrying out the consultation, to apply the desiderata and suggestions ensuring its regular execution, aird for this purpose is ready to take part conjointly with the league&apos;s control commission in the elaboration of the procedure and of the technical details connected with the consultation.   The Polish Government entirely shares the councibs view that the Kovno Government, when accepting the counciPs recommendation of 28th October considered that, according to terms of the (? Riga) peace &quot;preliminaries, Poland and Lithuania were entitled to settle by mutual agreement between themselves the assignment of the territories in question.   This indeed is a consequence of Article 1 of the peace preliminaries whereby Soviet Russia renounces all rights and claims in respect of the territories situated to the west of the frontier fixed by the peace preliminaries.   As Poland and Lithuania have by their free consent submitted the settlement of this question to the League of Nations, and have accepted popular consultation under its auspices, although the Soviet Government does not recognize the league, there can be no grounds for the last named Government making reservations of any sort with regard to the counciPs decision of 28th October or as regards the carrying out of the consultation and the consecration of its results by the league.   With the exception of that Government there exist no other parties who have not accepted the league&apos;s decisions or whose rights need be reserved.It is only just that the council should withhold its sanction from any consultation which may have been carried out in conditions which failed to give adequate guarantees to all interested parties ; but that,makes it all the more indispensable that such sanction should be assured without restriction to the consultation prescribed by
the League of Nations, which is to decide on the allocation of the contested area, either to the Kovno-Lithuanian state or to Poland.-Telegraphing again on 20th January [No. 48] Sir Percy said that he had been informed by Prince Sapieha that steps had Deen taken to remove Colonel Bpbicki, 11.- A branovitch, and two of the other protagonists of the &quot; Central Lithuanian &quot; movement from Vilna. Their departure, Sir Percy went on to say, ought greatly to facilitate the task of the Polish Government in securing the withdrawal of General Zeligowski&apos;s troops and he trusted that it might be the prelude to the Polish Government getting the situation there properly under control. He regarded the measure as a proof of the Polish Governments sincerity in this matter.Upper Silesia. On 22nd January Sir Percy Loraine reported [No. 58] that the Polish Government had announced that if, after the plebiscite. Upper Silesia, became Polish no change would be made in the present regime for the exploitation of the coal mines ; and that the mines would not be placed under the coal office, in order that the Upper Silesian coal (? industry) might be assured promptly and normally developed in the same conditions as hitherto.RUSSIA.Deportation of Russians from the United Kingdom. On 15th January Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 10] the following message to Mr. Lonergan for transmission to M. Chicherin :  On 20th November last a list was handed to M. Krassin of certain Russian citizens whose deportation from the United Kingdom had been duly recommended by the competent judicial authorities, and since that date various additions have from time to time been made. His Majesty&apos;s Government requested that tiny might be iuformed whether you would give the necessary permission for the persons in question to enter Russia, as without some such guarantee it would be impossible to secure for them transit visas through any of the Baltic states. M. Krassin has repeatedly been reminded of the urgent need of a reply to this question, and although in the middle of December he promised that a reply would be forthcoming within a few days, no notification has yet been received by His Majesty&quot;s Government. The names and full particulars of each person have already been handed to M. Krassin, together with the details of the offence which has made them liable for deportation, and these have no doubt been communicated to you. In order that no further delay may take place in this matter, His Majesty-&apos;s Government propose to deport all the persons whose names have already been notified to M. Krassin in the first available ship proceeding to Constantinople, whence they will be sent to Odessa at the first opportunity, thus obviating the necessity for transport visas. As there has not yet come to hand any reply to the notifications which have been made to M. Krassin about these persons, His Majesty&apos;s Government think it right to warn you of their intentions and will in due course inform you of the date of departure, together with other details as customary.Soviet Representative in Persia. On 18th January Mr. Lonergan reported [No. 3] from Reval that Theodore Rothstein was proceeding to Persia forthwith, as he had been appointed by the Soviet Government its diplomatic representative in Persia.SPAIN.Strike in the Ministry of . Finance. On 17th January Mr. Wingfield telegraphed [No. 13] from Madrid that, in consequence of a royal decree, dated 30th December, authorizing the creation of 100 new officials ranking as heads of departments of the Ministry of Finance, all officials of that department had gone on strike. The Minister of Finance, who was said to have tendered his. resignation owing to the agitation before the strike, had announced his intention of remaining in office until it Avas settled.The royal decree was condemned as a blunder by all, though the action of the officials in striking was blamed, particularly as this was done before trying other means of obtaining redress.Mr. Wingfield added that he had heard on good authority, though certain organs of the press had categorically denied the rumour, that the real reason for the adoption of this apparently uncalled for measure, was the desire to find appointments for the officers who.had been expelled from the army by the juntas. -21   4 0
Telegraphing again [No. 14] on 21st January, Mr&quot;. Wing field reported that the Government had obtained a vote of confidence from the Senate on 19th January7, and that on 20th January the Chamber of Deputies had adopted by a large majority,, but with many abstainers, a motion assuring the Government of its support in dealing with the strike, reserving the right of enquiring into its origin later. The Minister of Finance later resigned in order to facilitate a solution.SYRIA.The Lebanon. The following paragraph is taken from a despatch sent from Beirut on 21st December 1920 by Mr. R. A. Fontana, the British consul: In the late summer of 1915 the Lebanon mountains were visited by a great swarm of locusts, which ravaged the whole district and consumed every green thing. In 1916 the people of the Lebanon, which was then occupied by a Turkish division, began to feel the pinch of hunger, and in 1917 and 1918 famine desolated the whole region. Supplies of grain were sent by the Turkish Government to be distributed for the relief of the people, but these supplies were so manipulated by mutessarifs, kaimakams and others, who in many7 cases sold the grain at exorbitant prices, that the relief afforded was entirely insufficient. Over one-third of the inhabitants of the Lebanon died of famine during those y7ears, and in 1918 hundreds of people died of starvation in the streets of Beirut and other towns of the littoral. After the British occupation a great number of Lebanese who possessed the means to travel emigrated to America,, so that not more than one-third of the original inhabitants of the Lebanon now remain in the country . I have visited various villages in the mountains which before the war were prosperous and full of life, but their present aspect is most desolate. The few inhabitants remaining live mostly upon money received from relatives in America, and there is very little sign of husbandry7 or activity of any7 kind. In every7 village there are a number of deserted and roofless houses, the owners of which, before perishing, demolished their roofing in order to sell the timber, with which it w7as constructed, to buy7 bread; Many other houses, although still intact, stand empty7 or deserted, and buildings commenced shortly before the war still remain in the condition in which they7 were left when work was abandoned. Labour is so scarce and expensive that the work of construction cannot be resumed. The French authorities prohibited, some months ago, emigration from the Lebanon, but would-be emigrants have no great difficulty7 in evading the regulation by7 bribery.The French in Syria. In his despatch of 21st December last, Mr. Fontana wrote as follows : There is marked and general dissatisfaction with French mandatory7 rule both at Beirut and in the Lebanon as a whole. Even the Maronite community, the largest of the various Christian sects, and considering themselves as Catholics to enjoy the special favour of the French, speak of tbe present regime with strong&quot; disfavour. Unanimous regret is expressed at the withdrawal of the British from Syria, and many7 people say7 that they were better off under the Turks than now. Various causes have combined to produce this public dissatisfaction. The one is that the French Government, after the enormous sacrifices and expenditure of the war, are unable to sink money in Syria as lavishly7 as the inhabitants expected. This the Syrians resent, and still more so the increase of taxation in the old Lebanon, where a merely nominal tax was before levied on real property. It is calculated that more than one-half of the s landed property in the Lebanon mountains belongs to the monasteries of different orders, which are numerous and hold the iinest positions. No account is taken of the fact that, in spite of this increase, taxation remains relatively very7 low. The French are accused .of exploiting the country to their own profit and the detriment of the Syrians. Another cause of complaint lies in the nomination of French conseillers &quot; to every7 department of the administration, whose approval is required before action can be taken. It is urged that the native officials have no power in their hands, and that the French are virtually7 colonizing the country. The blame for the corruption prevalent among officials is imputed to the French, as owing to the enormous rise in prices sums now expended in bribery have to be fat-larger than before the war. And the fact of certain blench officers and officials Toeing. venal is so magnified as to elicit sweeping condemnation of local French.
officialdom. A third pretext for dissatisfaction is the defective lighting of Beirut, Mind relative paralysis in public works in the town itself, the malcontents overlooking the fact that they themselves loudly deprecate the increase of taxation necessary to render such works possible. French officers, moreover, have for some reason rendered themselves - temporarily unpopular among ladies belonging to the higher native -society at Beirut, and the existence of a large lay school under French masters, which is largely attended by Jews, is looked upon askance by high native ecclesiastics. The French are accused of looking down upon the Syrians, and the words sale Syrienhe or sale Syrien, dropped by individual Frenchmen, are resented as a national insult.The French, on their side, are embarrassed by the great military expenditure -called for owing to the unsettled state of Syria and Cilicia, and by the comparatively modest military forces at their command. Military officers, nevertheless, hold posts in the administration which would be better occupied by French civil functionaries of experience, whose number is wholly inadequate to meet the requirements of the moment. At Aleppo French officers are at present holding nearly all the posts intended ultimately to be filled by French officials. The French functionaries, more-over, besides being relatively few, have not always been wisely selected. The secretary -of the acting High Commissioner told me that M. cle Caix, when in France last year, did his utmost to recruit competent officials, with or without colonial experience, for Syria, but the gaps left by the war and disinclination to accept service in the Near East rendered his efforts almost fruitless. The lack of higher education among the Syrians and the ignorance of any but Turkish methods of administration unfit them at present, in the opinion of the French, for administrative posts without foreign supervision ;. and thus the system of &quot; conseillers,&quot; against whose decision appeal -can only be made to the High Commissioner, has been evolved as a &quot; temporary measure&quot; to remain in force until the Syrians have acquired the art of self-govern-ment, Unfortunately; for the reason I have indicated, these &quot; conseillers &quot; do not -always possess the tact and ability requisite for their functions. The sensitive vanity of the educated native, and his proclivity to intrigue and peroration rather than to action, call for more indulgence and patience than the average French official is likely to possess.The sacrifices made by the French in blood and money for the pacification of -Syria, and the excellent carriage roads suitable for motor traffic constructed by them throughout the greater part of the Great Lebanon and elsewhere in Syria, :seems to elicit no word of appreciation from the Syrians themselves. Damascus is now accessible by motor in four hours from Beirut, and Aleppo in ten. hours. Hundreds of motor cars and lorries now exist where none existed before. But the Syrian in general, disinclined to sustained action other than commercial, and respecting above all things wealth in whatsoever way acquired, is naturally prone to -criticism of western methods dissimilar to his own, however beneficial they may ultimately prove ; and to impatience, under a foreign mandate, of an)?- but the shortest road leading to his own aggrandizement and affluence. It is therefore safe, perhaps, to discount a large percentage of Syrian dissatisfaction with the French mandate, as likely to have evinced itself even under other and far more favourable conditions.TURKEY. tAcceptance of Financial Control. Telegraphing from Constantinople on 17th January [No. 34], Sir Horace Rumbold reported that  T.1,200,000 would be paid forthwith to the Turkish Government, in consequence of its acceptance of the form of control proposed by the provisional financial commission. The  T.252,000 gold now under embargo would be collateral security.Nationalist Proclamation to the Arabs. On 17th January Sir Herbert Samuel telegraphed from Jerusalem [No. 19] that he had received the translation of a.. proclamation issued by Mustafa Kemal to &quot; my brethren the Assyrian Arabs in.. general,&quot; in which he said that his victorious armies had already occupied Smyrna, Baghclacl and Mosul, and would soon advance to southern Syria. He called for united action against the Allies, to whose false promises he alluded.Greeks and Turks. On 24th January Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 42] that his French and Italian colleagues had communicated to him a copy of a telegram from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to Angora, which had been published in the Anatolian
press, announcing that it had been transmitted to the allied Powers. The substance-was as follows : The Nationalist forces, on re-occupying the territory abandoned by the Greeks in their recent retreat, found nothingjout a mass of ruins and corpses of men, women and children, tbe women having- been violated before death. Unless the allied Powers put an immediate stop to these Greek atrocities and prevent their recurrence, it will be impossible to prevent the Moslem population from exercising reprisals on the Christian community. The allied Powers are begged, in the name of humanity, to do this, and the Angora Government promises to use every effort to prevent regrettable reprisals.Sir Horace added that his Italian colleague had learnt that there had been no-signs of reprisals at Adalia, but they might have started in the interior of Anatolia.
