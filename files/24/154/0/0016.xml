FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.ALBANIA. .   &apos;The Situation. Ou 3rd May Sir Alban Young reported from Belgrade [No. 118] that be bad learnt from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the Albanian Govern-ment at Tirana still existed, but that it bad yielded to the pressure of public feeling and agreed to send a deputation to Paris to invite Essad Pasha to return .and take over the Government. The newspapers of 1st May published a message from Scutari stating that the insurgents under Osman Bali had entered Tirana and upset the Government, and that the Albanian Assembly had agreed to take the above-mentioned course.ARMENIA.American Attitude in regard to a Mandate-On 29th April Sir Auckland geddes telegraphed [No. 307] from Washington that the reported offer of a mandate for Armenia to the United States had been very unfavourably received by Congress and the Press. Even Senator Hitchcock, the democratic leader, had expressed himself very strongly against acceptance. The opinion generally expressed was that this mandate involved greater political difficulties and fewer economic advantages than those taken by Great Britain, and that the offer should not even be considered unless accompanied hy the control of Constantinople and the Straits. But even if this control were included he (Sir A. Geddes) thought it highly improbable that America would accept.AUSTRIA.Emigration ^Schemes. Mr. Bridgeman reported [No. 218] on 23rd April as follows : Austrian officersof the former Imperial army, who are now in the greatest distress, owing to their nominal pension being wholly insufficient to support them and their families, have formed a society called &quot;New Home,&quot; of which the object is to organize colonization overseas. Some 700 members of the society have already, with Italian assistance, settled in Sao Paulo, Brazil; others are anxious to follow the first settlers as soon as possible.Major Wilhelm Thurner, who has been elected to represent this colonization society, has applied for permission to go to London accompanied by three other members of the society, Eugen Erbler, Koloman Erbler, and Frieclrich Thurner, for the purpose of discussing emigration schemes in general, and endeavouring to make special arrangements with shipping companies. Major Thurner is provided with a letter of introduction from the Austrian State Department.Mr. Bridgeman recommended that permission be granted to the four persons named to go to London.Sale of War Material. On 21th April Mr. Bridgeman telegraphed [No. 219] from Vienna that he had informed Dr. Renner that morning verbally that the attention of the Allied Governments had been drawn to the sale of war material by Austria, and that it was the wish of His Majesty&apos;s Government that this practice should be discontinued, as it appeared to constitute a violation of Articles 133 and 131 of the Peace Treatj7. Dr. Renner admitted that sales of war material had taken place, but only to the Polish Government and the Czecho-Sldvak Government, at the request of the French Government. He added that the Austrian Government had welcomed the sales, as they provided the means of paying for sugar and other foodstuffs so badly needed there. He said that he took note of the sales being regarded as a breach of the Treaty of Peace, but observed that as the Peace Treaty had not yet come into force, the point whether the sales of war material, which had already taken place, were really a violation of the Treaty, was questionable.Mr. Bridgeman&apos;s Italian colleague, who appeared to attach great importance to stopping the sale of war materials, was convinced (1) that the Austrians were selling as much as they could in order to obtain ready money ; (2) that the French were not .  averse to the sale of Austrian war material to CzechO-Slovakia and Poland, whom they regard as special Allies of France.
Mr. Bridgeman and his colleague came to the conclusion that if it he desired to stop the sale of war material, it would be well to specify very precisely to the Austrian Government which particular material is not to be sold, indicating its where-.abouts if possible, otherwise the Austrian Government will find an excuse for con-tinning to sell, by claiming that the material is covered neither by the Armistice Agreement nor by the Peace Treaty, the latter not yet being in force, and the manufacture of the material having been completed since the signature of the former.Transfer of Hungarian Communists to Russia. On 30th April, Mr. Bridgeman sent [No. 228] the following translation of an urgent communication which he had just received from the State Chancellor: I have just learned that the Peoples&apos; Commissary for Foreign Affairs, Soviet Russian Republic, has applied to the Entente Powers with a view to obtaining an assurance that they would place no obstacles in the wav of transfer to Russia of Hungarian Communists, who formerly belonged to the Soviet Government at Budapest, which the Moscow Government had considered as a kindred Government, and who are now interned or imprisoned at Vienna. Should this report prove true, I wish to state that, as far as the Austrian Government is concerned, the transfer to Russia of these Communists would be a real relief, as their internment, which from a practical point of view is undoubtedly necessary, is very difficult to conciliate with existing laws. In view of this situation, which for the Austrian Government involves serious objections at home, and serious responsibility abroad, I have the honour to call your attention to the fact that the transfer to Russia of the above-mentioned Hungarian Communists would free the Austrian Government from considerable practical and political difficulties, and that the latter Government would consequently be very grateful to the Great Powers if they would be so good as to allow the Communists in question to be transferred to Russia, should opportunity arise.In order to give an idea of the embarrassment which the present situation creates for the Austrian Government, I think it rny duty especially to point out that the internment in question is not warranted by law, as Austrian legislation makes no provision as regards an internment, the object of which is to assure the safety of the interned. On the other hand, the Communists would have as a consequence either to provoke acts of violence against themselves, or would render Hungarian attempts to kidnap them still more frequent, and would be apt to add still further to the heavy charge which the iDresence of the Communists has, for more than a year, laid upon the Austrian Government. It is for this reason that 1 should be grateful if you would impress on your Governmenf the advisability of permitting the Hungarian Communists to go where they themselves please, and where their presence is considered desirable. In recommending this solution, I venture to add that in my opinion it would in no wise augment, but &quot; would rather lessen the danger of Communism which it is the general interest of the whole of Europe to eliminate.BALTIC STATES.   .Finland and the Soviet Government. Telegraphing from Helsingfors on 24th April [No. 429], Lord Acton reported that the Soviet armistice delegates had produced an ultimatum to the Finnish delegates, agreeing in effect to a narrow neutral zone along the Russian side of Karelia, with the proviso that a broader neutral zone should be made to run parallel with it along the Finnish frontier. The Soviet delegates also demanded the inclusion of the islands in the free waterway through the Gulf of Finland, a demand which the Finnish delegates had declined to entertain. Lord Acton had been informed by the Prime Minister that the Chief of the General Staff had advised the . acceptance of this ultimatum so as to get the armistice signed, trusting that under the protection of the Great Powers modifications to over-stringent conditions-would be effected in the peace negotiations. The Prime Minister himself -appeared inclined to accept the terms, subject to the condition that the status quo be^ maintained in Karelia, where the Russian forces were weak. In his view the alternative was the passing to direct peace negotiations in conjunction with Poland, rather than a necessary resumption of hostilities.The Finnish Government, Lord Acton reported, had sent a Note to the Norwegian Government to the effect that the Pechenga controversy only concerned Finland and Russia, but that the position would not hinder an amicable settlement between Finland and Norway. An intimation to Norway that she was not concerned in the question had also been sent by the Peoples&apos; Commissary for Foreign Affairs..
The Armistice Negotiations.- As a sequel to the foregoing Lord Acton sent [No. 436] on 28th April the following account of the armistice negotiations which had been communicated to him by the Finnish Government, covering the period from 22nd April to 25th April: The Russian delegation had previously formulated proposals, and at the first meeting the Finnish delegation enquired whether the latter could be-so modified as to be acceptable to the Finnish Government. The President of the Russian delegation replied that he was unable to discuss the Finnish proposals before the receipt of a categorical reply relative to the question of free passage through the Gulf of Finland, the Chief of the Finnish delegation then proposed a compromise on the latter point, subject to acceptance by Russia of the Karelian and Pechenga demands. The Russian delegates declined to accept the Finnish compromise relative to the free&apos;waterway, and maintained an uncompromising attitude on the subject of Karelia and Pechenga. On 24th April, the Russian delegates broke off negotiations-on the pretext of the necessity to consult Moscow. The chief Russian delegate added that the interruption would be provisional only, although he was unable to give the date for resumption of the negotiations.On the following day both delegations returned to Moscow and Helsingfor-s-respectively.BULGARIA.Note in regard to Thrace. On 3rd May Mr. Craigie telegraphed from Sofia [No. 44] the following summary of a note received from the Bulgarian Government : Monsieur Ganef, the President of the Bulgarian Delegation, addressed to the San Remo Conference a note purporting to formulate the Bulgarian claims in regard to Thrace. This step was undertaken without previous consultation with the Bulgarian Government who declare the note to be null and void.In ceding the sovereignty of Western Thrace to the principal Powers, the Bulgarian Peace Delegation had (? already been) (one group imclecypherable) for believing that the territory would form an (? autonomous) State under the League of Nations or one of the Powers : but for this prospect they would not have agreed to the sacrifice. Moreover, the solemn promise of Bulgarian access to the ^Fgean Sea would be rendered absolutely illusoiw if Decleagatch and the railway leading to it,. wrere to be given to Greece ; Bulgaria would be entitled to claim that the treaty had been modified to her disadvantage. The Bulgarian Government therefore remain confident that the existing regime will, be rendered permanent, in accordance with the desire of the immense majority of the population.As regards Eastern Thrace the Bulgarian Government trusts it will be united to Western Thrace under the regime proposed. Failing this, the Bulgarian Government would agree to the proposal in the note from the President of the United States that Bulgaria should receive the Adrianople and Kirkilisse regions.THE CAUCASUS.The Situation. Telegraphing [No. 447] to Lord Curzon on 27th April, Admiral, de Robeck summarized the situation to the following effect: -To retain any part of the Batum province, would require a considerable reinforcement to enable Red, and probably Turkish, pressure to be met. All supplies would have to be delivered by sea- The position in Armenia would be little the better. Withdrawal from fire province would be politically a very serious matter and would mean the isolation of Armenia, and would, be followed by anarchy from which we should be expected to save, thousands of all nationalities. There was no alternative to withdrawal unless means were found to meet General Milne&apos;s requirements for holding a small area. To carry out a withdrawal, allied subjects in Baku and Tiflis would have to be called! in first, and the movement effected in time to let those quit the country who wished to do so, before pressure was applied.Attitude of Georgia. Commander Luke telegraphed [No. 524] from Tiflis on 30th April, confirming the report of M. Chicherin&apos;s conciliatory offer to Georgia. The latter has replied that Bolshevik violation of Georgian territory on the north-east dirontier, and the arrests of Georgian agents at Baku are hardly consistent with the offer, but pourparlers still go on. Nevertheless, Georgia is still preparing for resistance and is mobilizing six classes in Tiflis and elsewhere. The announcement that British assistance would be forthcoming would probably greatly improve the-spirit of Georgian resistance, which, however, depended in the end on our retention of Batum. -
CHINA.Chinese Eastern Railway.- Mr. Hodgson sent [No. 101] the following information from Vladivostock on 28th April : The Inter-Allied Railway Committee is informed from Harbin that the financial situation of the Chinese Eastern Railway is so critical that failing prompt support all movement on the line maybe suspended. The Czechs owe some -f 4,000,000 for their transport account, and the French some f 400,000, but the former appear indisposed to make any settlement, and intend writing off their debt against sums eventually payable to them by Russia, The Chinese High Commissioner states that China is paying no less than $600,000 silver a month to assist the running of the line. These payments will not, however, go through the Allied fund.On the same clay Mr. Hodgson transmitted [No. 105] the text of a telegram that had been sent to the Chinese, French, American and Czecho-Slovak Governments :- -The members of the Inter-Allied Railway Committee, having examined the report of Mr. Smith the American member of the Committee, recently returned from Trans-Baikalia (where on the invitation of General Janin he had been despatched by the Committee as its representative for the purpose of assisting to improve traffic conditions, more particularly as they affected the evacuation of the Czecho-Slovak troops), and having acquainted themselves with the reports on the action of the Japanese troops at Hailar and other places on the Chinese Eastern Railway as set forth in the protest recently forwarded to Peking by the Technical Board at Harbin, are of opinion that : (1) The Russian military authorities, particularly Colonel Medy, Chief of semi-military communications, have in the Trans-Baikalia system almost set aside the terms of the Inter-Allied Railway Agreement under which the technical operation of the railway should be in the hands of the Technical Board.(2) The Japanese military authorities have acquiesced in Colonel Medy&apos;s attitude ; have themselves usurped functions by right belonging to the Technical and Transportation Boards ; and have used them in such a way as to add to the confusion on the railway and actually to delay the progress of the Czecho-Slovaks.(3) &apos;The Japanese military authorities by placing detachments of troops at points along the Chinese Eastern Railway assigned by the Inter-Allied Agreement to Chinese guardianship and-allowing such detachments to intervene in matters affecting the railway-, have provoked conflicts resulting in Russians, Chinese and Czecho-Slovaks causing needless loss of life, and the movement of trains has been jeopardized.The Committee believe that representations to the Japanese Government on the subject of the foregoing might be efficacious in securing a proper observance of the Inter-Allied Agreement by the Japanese command on the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Ussuri Railway.Tibet [F.C.R., xv., p. 3].-In a telegram [No. 240] from Peking Mr. Alston reports the receipt of a message from Mr. King, stating that the Frontier Commissioner of Szechuen was clearly determined to force a collision with Tibetan troops, and that unless the Chinese authorities could restrain the Commissioner, hostilities were inevitable.Mr. Alston had replied that he had received the assurances of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the. Chinese troops on the frontier would not advance against the Tibetans, and that instructions had been despatched to the frontier authorities to remain strictly on the defensive. Mr. King was requested to explain this to the Chinese authorities, and to use every effort to restrain hostilities. If, in spite of this, the Chinese advanced, he was to try and induce the Tibetans to restrict themselves to defensive action.DENMARK.Trade with Russia.-Mv. Grant Watson reported. [No. 439] on 22nd April that M. Krassin had called, on the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and had raised the question of trade between Denmark and Russia. For this purpose he said it would be indispensable to have a Russian trade delegation in Denmark and a Danish delegation in Russia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that, the Danish Government would consider the matter, and he referred M. Krassin to the Chamber of 16-1 .B
Manufacturers and the Merchants&apos; Guild, who later applied to the Danish Government for permission to send-representatives to Russia to study commercial prospects.. The presence of a Russian delegate in Copenhagen had roused a certain interest in the Russian market, and the Danish Government were therefore most anxious to be kept informed of the policy of the Allies towards Russia.New Government. On 4th May ReuteFs agent at Copenhagen reported that a new Cabinet had been formed as follows : M. Neergaard - Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.M. Scavenius     - - - Minister for Foreign Affairs.M. Christensen - - - Minister for Public Worship.M. Berntsen      - - - Minister for Defence.M. Sigurd Berg        - - - Minister of the Interior.M. Jacob Appel - Minister for Education.M. Slebsager - Minister of Transport.M. Svenning Rytter - - Minister of Justice.M. Madsen Mygdal   - - - Minister of Agriculture.M. Tyge Rothe - - - Minister for Commerce.GERMANY.Headquarters of the Mixed Arbitral Court.  On 26th April Lord Kilmarnock telegraphed [No. 254] the reply of the German Government to the proposal to make London the headquarters of the Mixed Arbitral Court, giving the reasons for which it is impossible for them to agree unconditionally. The grounds are partly those of expense and partly the fact that other Powers would then demand the setting up of similar tribunals in different allied capitals. Germany has only a limited number of officials available, and is obliged to use the same persons as arbitrators for several countries. She therefore proposes Berne, The Hague, Copenhagen, Stockholm or Christiania as headquarters. The German Government would, however, agree to London if other &quot; English-speaking &quot; Powers would consent to its adoption for the headquarters of their tribunals. By English-speaking Powers it is apparently meant to designate Japan, Siam, Hayti, Liberia and the United States. The proposal is that French-speaking Powers should accept Paris. This wrould include South American States and Portugal.When handing the reply to Lord Rilmarnock the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained that there was no question of prestige on the part of the German Government, but simply one of material diQiculty. If an arrangement on the above lines could be come to, the German Government would willingly accept London.Note in regard to the propose I Meeting at Spa. Telegraphing from Berlin on 3rd May, Lord Kilmarnock transmitted [No. 271] the following literal translation of a note which the Chancellor had given the Italian Charge d&apos;Affaires : In reply to the letter that Your Excellency was good enough to address to me on 26th April, 1 have the honour to inform you that the German Government, accepting the invitation of the Allied Powers, will take part in the Conference which is to take place at Spa on 25th May.In the conviction that it will succeed in invalidating the reproaches of having failed in the execution of certain of the conditions of peace, the German Government refrains until the proposed meeting takes place from entering on the question raised.It is, however, obliged to point out that neither the law of nations nor the Treaty of Peace would give the Allied Governments the right to occupy fresh portions of German territory.The German Government will present to the Conference, the desired explanations and proposals, and on its part will do its best to ensure that a result satisfactory in all respects is arrived at.HUNGARY.The Jews. On 25th April Mr. Hohler telegraphed from Budapest [No. 249] saying that ever since he had been there he had constantly made representations on behalf of the Jews. Their situation was certainly better and the Government was unquestionably doing all in its power to protect them ; though it was unable to control the anti-Semite feeling of a section of the populace especially of the younger soldiers, the principal reason for this being the identification of the Jews as a whole
with Bolshevism. He had no reason to believe that there was any danger of a massacre of Jews at &quot;Debreezen ; his Polish colleague, however, had told him that some hundreds of his Jewish compatriots had been expelled under circumstances of undue hardship.   - ............. ....v .r&apos;   -,.MEXICO. -       vThe Situation. Telegraphing from Mexico on 3rd May [No. 105] Mr: Cummins reported the existence of considerable excitement. He said that paper money was refused by the merchants, and that preparations for the defence of the city were being-made by the Government. The railway to Vera Cruz had been cut; and, with the exception of the line to Laredo which was open to the border, traffic on the other lines was suspended.POLAND.Negotiations with the Soviet Government. -Telegraphing from Warsaw on 20th April [No 268] Sir Horace Rumbold reported that the Polish Government had issued a communique respecting the peace negotiations Avith the Soviet Government, to the following effect : It defends the choice of Boryssow as the place of negotiation, as both sides would have the advantage of their communications being each-under its own control.&apos;It justifies the refusal of the Bolshevik counter-demand for a general armistice on the ground of technical difficulties in enforcing the armistice over so extensive a front; the ill-effect on the negotiations of inevitable &quot;incidents&quot; in connexion with its observance ; the temptation to prolong the negotiations unduly, and the fact .of Poland undertaking to refrain from any aggressive operations, was simpler, quicker, and equally effective. ;. -. .  .The only reply of the Bolsheviks has been a Bolshevik concentration and offensive, followed by a request to the Allied Governments to intervene in the choice of a locality which the Bolsheviks themselves had left to Poland. The Bolshevik dissent as regards place is therefore a mere pretext for postponing negotiations.;   .Nevertheless, the Bolish Government still desires a just and speedy peace, and are ready to start negotiations as soon as the Soviets are convinced of the futility of further warfare.The Strike Wave. On 21st April, Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 270] that a fresh strike Avave had broken out in Poland, the demands of the strikers consisting mostly&apos;&apos; in an increase of wages, though they were generally accompanied by other demands of a radical character.The prices of foodstuffs and commodities were, he said, increasing, but they did hot justify the increases demanded by the workmen. It AAras therefore believed that these strikes Avere of a political rather than of an economic character, and that they.had been provoked by the Communist propaganda, which of late bad become more intense and which was inspired by the Bolsheviks. It Avas maintained in some quarters that the Bolsheviks, realising their military defeat, Avere doing all they7 could to provoke disorders in Poland.RUSSIA.Lord Curzon and M. Chicherin. On 24th April Lord Curzon sent the following telegram [No. 25] from San Remo for transmission to&apos; M. Chicherin : In raj telegram of 11th April I asked you to state the conditions upon which ynu &apos; would cease hostilities and come to terms Avith General Wrangebs forces in the Crimea, and on 17th April not having received your reply7, and hearing that the Soviet troops were still attacking, I warned you that, if hostilities continued, I should have no alternative but to order the British ships in the Black Sea to give protection to the Crimean forces. On 19th April I received a telegram from y&apos;ou complaining of the bombardment of the Bolshevik forces in the Black Sea by British A^essels. These forces are marching along the coast to attack a town occupied by a British garrison, namely, Batum, and their movement is an act of war which His Maj esty&apos;s forces are bound and will continue to resist, In the meantime arrived your telegram of 15th April, in which, AAdiile expressing sympathy with the earlier appeal from me, you endeavoured to attach to it the double condition of the release of the Soviet prisoners in Austria and the reception of M. Litvinoff in London as the representative of the Russian Government to discuss these and other matters. These proposals are 16-1 C
repeated by you in your telegram of 20th April. I am unable to recognize any connexion between the question of the Austrian prisoners, over whom I have no control, and the position in the Crimea ; nor can 1 consent, for reasons with which you are familiar, to negotiate with M. Litvinoff in London. I regret that, at a moment when we had hoped to be able to make arrangements for the development of economic relations between the two countries, the Soviet forces should be engaged in open hostilities with British forces, and I cannot conceal that such proceedings on your part will have a most unfortunate effect upon public opinion in Great Britain. I shall be prepared to desist from -hostilities when you have given similar orders to your troops, and have entered into friendly negotiations concerning the force in the Crimea. -To this M. Chicherin sent the following reply through Reval [No. 88] on 29th April:-Your radio dated 25th April has been carefully considered by the Russian Government. This Government deeply regrets that the British Government has refused to adopt the measures within its power in order to arrange the transfer to Russia of the members of the former Hungarian Soviet Government, and is firmly confident that the British Government will alter its decision in this matter, and will adopt the course suggested by us, the only one corresponding to the principles.of humanity referred to by the British Government, seeing that in fact the bringing over of Bela Kuii and his friends from Austria to Russia depends upon the British Government, At a moment when the British Government is appealing to the principles of humanity in its address to the Russian Government on the question of the remnants of General Denikin&apos;s army, the Russian Government considers it as perfectly normal to appeal to the same principles with reference to the interned Hungarian Communists ; and it cannot desist from finding it somewhat astonishing that the British Government refuses to apply to the Russian Government Allies the principles it desires to apply to its own Allies. - The Russian Government, nevertheless, is loath to impede the suggested agreement with the British Government, and yielding to the latter&apos;s desire, it declares its readiness to enter into an agreement involving that life will be guaranteed to the remnants of the Southern White Guards, who will surrender under the same conditions as suggested in my radio of .21st February with reference to the White Guards of the North, these conditions having been then approved by the British Government and having remained without effect for the sole reason that the other part was no more in existence. If further-conditions are to be suggested by the British Government, they can be best discussed in direct negotiations with our representative who is now in Copenhagen. If another method is preferred by the British Government to come to an agreement, the Russian Government is ready to consider the corresponding proposals in a most friendly spirit.Telegraphing again on 3rd May through Reval [No. 130] Lord Curzon said :  I am glad to receive your message of 29th April.It is not strictly accurate to speak of the conditions suggested in your radio of 21st February with reference to the Archangel forces as having been &quot; approved &quot; by His Majesty&apos;s Government. In acknowledging the receipt of that message I stated, in my telegram of 28th feburary to Reval for transmission to you by wireless, that I had received your message &quot; which it is now too late for me to communicate to the North Russian Government,&quot; thereby indicating that your conditions were, in my opinion., a matter of discussion and negotiation. In my first telegram on the subject of South Russia (of 11th April) I spoke of the &quot; termination of hostilities,&quot; of a &quot;general amnesty,&quot; and of &quot; conciliatory treatment,&quot; whereas your latest reply appears to demand unconditional surrender, subject only to an undertaking to abstain from capital punishment and to allow the more prominent leaders to leave the country. This is a very different-thing. If these matters are to be discussed between us, this can only be after a cessation of all hostilities both in the Crimea and on the borders of the Caucasian States where your forces are engaged in conflict either with British forces or with those who are the friends of Great Britain. On the Crimean front I suggest that you communicate direct with General Wrangel with a view to the initiation of definite negotiations ; and I shall be glad, if all parties agree, to despatch a British officer to take part in the deliberations.In reply to your enquiry as to further conditions, I have indicated that negotiations are doomed to failure, whether in Europe or in Asia, as long as the Soviet forces are engaged in open hostilities with those whom we are actually defending with our arms, or in whose political independence we are closely concerned.
The only method by which peace can be successfully re-established is by an assurance to desist from these attacks. If this be given and adhered to, the first of thenecessary conditions will have been fulfilled, and negotiations can be. pursued in a friendly-spirit. &apos; - . &quot;Purchase of Wool in Mongolia. The following wireless message, signed by M. Lebedeff, President of the Central Administration of Textile Enterprises, was despatched from Moscow on 27th April: 1We beg to inform you that in accordance with the decision arrived at on 23rd March, an agreement has been concluded between the Administration and the Commissariat for Foreign Trade for the purchase of cotton and wool in Mongolia.For this purpose a special expedition headed by Killian (?) will -be sent shortly.The agency will be opened in Semipalatinsk, owing to its favourable geographical position, and .... to the Mongolian frontier. The financing of purchases, as well as all administrative functions will be handed over, to the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Trade. Technical work will be carried out under the guidance of the Chief Textile Committee, by which Controllers with full powers will be appointed to the provinces. In order to pay for goods purchased in various places, and to defray -all expenses in connexion with transport and organization, the Chief Textile Com-mittee has opened a preliminary credit for the .People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Trade, amounting to 1^ million roubles for the purchase of wool, and five million roubles for the expenses in connection with organization.pJKRAINA.Relations with Poland. On 28th April Sir Horace Rumbold reported from Warsaw [No. 294] that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had published an official communique to the effect that the Polish Government, when it acknowledged the right of Ukraina to independence, also recognised the Government of General Petlura and of the Directorate.Under date of 27th April, Marshal Pilsudski published a proclamation to the inhabitants of Ukraina in which he stated that under orders from him the Polish Army had commenced an offensive which would lead it far into Ukraina. The inhabitants of territories, where occupied, were to know that the Polish troops would *hase therefrom the foreign invaders against whom the Okrainan nation had risen to defend itself, and would rernain there until the Ukrainan Government was in a position to administer the country and the Okrainan army to defend it from a new invasion. The Polish soldiers would then retire from the lands they had freed, which they were iioav entering In the company of Ukrainan troops under the command of General Petlura. The proclamation expressed confidence that the Ukrainan nation would make every exertion, in collaboration with the Poles, to recover its independence, and exhorted the inhabitants to assist the Polish troops, however great might be the sacrifices brought about by the Avar. Full protection \vas guaranteed by the Polish troops to all inhabitants of Ukraina without distinction of class, race, or status.On the same day he further reported [No. 295] the following summary of a proclamation issued by General Petlura to the Ukrainan nation :-For (? three) years Ukraina has been struggling Avith the Russian Bolsheviks to establish its independence, in Avhich struggle it has sustained terrible moral and economic losses. In the summer of 1919, Kieff was temporarily7 occupied by General Denikin, who also induced the East Galician army to desert and join him, which placed the army to the east of Dnieper in a hopeless position. Exhausted and enfeebled, the Ukrainan army had to retreat, but hope was not dead. He (Petlura) ordered Pavlenko to attack the Bolsheviks, while the second Ukrainan army found refuge in Poland. Ncaa7s having been uoav received of fighting&apos; between Ukrainans and BolsheAuks in the districts-of Ekaterinoslav and Cherson, Ukrainan troops from. Poland are endeaA7ouring to effect a junction with their countrymen there, as also with the Ukrainan army fighting in Podolia. For three years Ukraina has been fighting without any help from foreign Powers which consistently disregarded its claim to-existence. General Pilsudski and the Polish State have now recognized the right of the Ukrainans to form an independent State, and other Powers aauII be unable to contest-this right, which is founded on justice. The Polish Government has given practical help aud, under an agreement recently7 concluded, the Polish and Ukrainan forces will fight side &quot;by side against the Bolsheviks, the common enemy of both, until the latter haA7e been defeated and the Polish army thus enabled to return to its own country. The Ukrainan territory under the presidency7 of Mazeppa has begun to prepare the civil administration of the country , but as this Avork will only7 be successful if ah (? departments) co-operate, all public institutions are requested to
assist the Government, and above all the Polish and Ukrainau, armies. An army will have to be raised in order to free Ukrainan territory from the presence of the enemy to render possible the summoning of a Constituent Assembly to decide on the future of the country.. South Russia.The Cossacks and the Soviet Government.  Telegraphing from Constantinople on 20th April [No. 422], Admiral Webb reported that M. Neratov had handed him a letter signed by General Wrangel and M. Struve, the purport of which was as follows : The Atamans of the Don, Kuban, Terek and Astrachan Cossacks protest against the seizure of their territories by Soviet Russia and apply (group undecypherable) to the Allied Governments as intermediaries in the negotiations for the cessation of hostilities.The agreement with the Atamans was concluded on 15th April, by which the Cossack regions received recognition of complete autonomy in return for  their . acknowledgment of General Wrangel&apos;s supreme command over the Cossack armed , forces.   It was iprovided that the relations between the Atamans and foreign Govern-. nients should be conducted through the Commander-in-Chief.General Wrangel accordingly desired to associate himself with the above demarche of the Atamans, and requested that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be informed of this present communication.TURKEY.The Porte and the Peace Conference. On 21st April Admiral Webb reported [No. 424] that the Porte had addressed a note to the High Commissioner on 19th April, setting out statistics of the population of Thrace, Smyrna and the eastern provinces of Asia Minor.Statistics were quoted from Vital Cuinet&apos;s book on Turkey-in-Asia published in 1892, and from recent official statistics the date of which-was not given, except for Thrace, in which case the year 1914 was mentioned.Figures were given by vilayets. They showed a great preponderance of Moslems in the provinces of Urzerum, Sivas, Diabekir, Kharput and Smyrna ; a considerable preponderance in Bitlis, Van and Western Thrace ; and a distinct preponderance in eastern thrace or Adrianople ; the minority in all cases was mixed.The note expressed appreciation of the spirit of justice displayed by the Peace Conference when, according to information received by the Grand - Vizier, in the autumn of 1919 it decided to form in Thrace a small autonomous State (the fate of which the Conference tied up with that of Constantinople), and emphasized the fact that the number of Turks in this region was double that of the total of the mixed non-Moslem population.The note invoked the principle of nationalities, which the Supreme Council was taking as1 the basis of&apos; world reconstruction, and claimed the application of this principle in Asia Minor generally, and especially, in Smyrna, which belonged indissolubly to the Empire from the geographical, the political, the economical and the ethnological points of view ; and without the restitution of which to the Sultan, as the custodian of the Turkish national patrimony, peace and stability in the East could not be assured.The note made no distinction between Moslems of different races.In a semi-official covering letter the Grand Vizier asked that the note should be telegraphed to San Remo, and reiterated the appeal for a satisfactory solution of questions relative to the essentially Turkish province of Smyrna.Telegraphing again on 30th April [No. 519], he said that the Grand Vizier had told him that he could not himself go to Paris with the Turkish Peace Delegation owing to the situation in Constantinople. He therefore wished to draw attention to the gravity of the situation resulting from the attempt to impose a drastic peace, such as the published statements regarding the proceedings of the Conference led&apos;the public to expect.The Grand Vizier stated that since coming into power he had had a very near view of the domestic situation in Turkey. There was uneasiness everywhere. He-had just seen a deputation from Adrianople, who had declared that if a Greek invasion of Thrace were permitted- even the women and children would be armed to resist it. ...Jaffar Tayar had used similar language, and declared that he could count upon Bulgarian assistance.
