FOREIGN  COUNTRIES   REPORT.ARABIA.King Hussein s threatened Resignation. On 26th February the following message from tbe Prime Minister was telegraphed [No. 20] to the British agent at Jeddah for transmission to King Hussein : I have received with great regret your Majesty&apos;s telegram of the 9th instant. As your Majesty is aware, His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Emir Feisal on your behalf are engaged in important conversations with a view to the establishment on firm, foundations of their mutual relations. I have every hope of a successful result, but it is obviously most important that no event should occur in the Arab countries to prejudice the negotiations here. I therefore hope that your Majesty will think no more about resigning, and I ask you, remembering the sincere friendship and confidence which existed between us during the war and ^he importance of the issues now under discussion, to assist towards the realization of our common purpose by using your influence to keep tbe people calm during this period of negotiation. You may rest assured that His Majesty&apos;s Government are doing their best to arrive at a solution which will be acceptable to all.On 2nd March, Major Batten, at Jeddab, was informed [No. 22]-that it was not practicable at present to make payment of any part of the renewed subsidy; also that King Hussein had telegraphed to Emir Feisal that he had determined not to withdraw from public affairs, as the latter had so often expressed the hope that Arab aspirations would be realized.AUSTRIA.The Question of the Transfer of Gold. Mr. Lindley telegrajxhed [No. 59] as follows from &quot;Vienna on 1st March : I have received a note from the Austrian Government protesting against the demand for an immediate transfer of part of the gold reserve of the AustrO-Hungarian Bank to the liquidators, as being contrary to the terms of the, treaty of St. Germain.The note goes on to say tbat the Austrian Government are nevertheless willing to transfer 65,000,000 crowns to the liquidators, provided that the gold does not leave Austria until either a competent tribunal constituted under Article 51- of the bank statutes or a neutral arbitral court has decided tbe question of law. The Austrian Government consider that the gold ought not to be used until the controversial questions arising out of Article 206 of the treaty have been settled by a competent decision or by a compromise. The gold destined to meet the N.U.M debt will be sent to Paris to-day.The question of the surrender of tbe gold to the liquidators has caused a great outcry during the last few days in the press, and really seems to turn on tbe rights of the note-holders as against those of the Austrian and Hungarian Governments and the shareholders. Apart from the merits of the case, it appears perhaps premature to break into the assets of the bank at this early stage of the liquidation.Telegraphing [No. 61] again on 4th March Air. Linclley reported that the Federal. Government had asked the Austrian section to move the Reparations Commission to agree that the legal question as to the ownership of the gold reserve should be determined by a neutral arbitrator, and that the ultimate disposal of the reserve should be suspended until the fundamental questions of the liquidation had been settled. The Austrian Government would in tbat case deliver 65,000,000 gold crowns to the liquidators by 11.th March, though legally the demand should be addressed pro rota to Budajpest as well. The attitude of the National Assembly and tbe public made further concessions impossible.The Southern Frontier.-Oa 4th March Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 60] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had that day&quot;again reverted to the subject of the southern frontier.   He said that he hoped that His Majesty s Government could see their way to
^suggesting to both the Austrian and the Serb-Croat-Slovene Governments that diredt negotiations should be initiated. If- this were done the Austrian Government would -at once take the matter up at Belgrade.The frontier commission would shortly start work so that negotiations should begin soon if a settlement was to be arrived at.   The proposed frontier inflicted great, hardships locally, and he, Mr. Lindley, thought that the Austrian Government would be ready to make concessions to the Serb-Groat-Slovene State and compensate the-^ latter for any modification regarding Abstallbecken.CHILE.. Insecurity in the Northern Provinces [F.C.R., xxxvii, p. 4]. In reply to an inquiry from Lord Curzon, Mr. Vaughan telegraphed. [No. 351 from Santiago on 3rd March that the movement in the north of Chile was largely Bolshevik, and that possible developments were purely guesswork. He went on to say that as there was now a strong garrison and the Chilean Government had voted a large sum to relieve unemployment, and as acceleration of the programme of (? 20th September), which had been intended as a (? precautionary) measure, had been agreed to, he had informed the commander-in-chief that the immediate need for a battleship appeared to have passed, especially as she could not arrive before the elections.   ,.CHINA.General Situation.  On 4th March Sir Beilby Alston telegraphed [No. 107] from Peking as follows : -   rThe rivalry between the northern military factions and the popular contenrpt for useless soldiery have both been accentuated by the capture of Urga by Mongolians .and Russian free, lances.The banks enabled the central Government to tide over the Chinese new year settlement, but only on the condition that a policy of retrenchment should be adopted.-The counter move of the military governors is now awaited, as retrenchment would undermine their position.In the south there is an increasing tendency for the provinces to experiment with self-government. Szechuen is the latest example. The southern confederation has been further weakened by the dismissal of Tang Chi Yao from the military governorship of Yunnan.COSTA  RICA.Dispute with Panama. In telegrams sent on 27th February- and 2nd, 4th, 5th ;and 7th March [Nos. 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11], Mr. Bennett reported from San Jose that he had been informed by the. Minister for Foreign Affairs that the sending of a police force to Goto was in no sense a hostile action as that territory had been confirmed to Costa Rica by the White award, confirming the Anderson-Porras treaty of 1910. The police force in question, however-, was compelled to surrender by Panama troops ; whereupon the Costa Rican forces advanced on Almirante -this was declared to be merely a punitive expedition, it being intended to withdraw the troops so soon as those of Panama should have evacuated Costa Rican territory. The mediation of the United States being proposed, Costa Rica accepted it; and according to a telegram&apos;[No. 16] sent by Mr. Graham from Panama, on 7th March, the president of Panama declared that he was ready to submit to arbitration on the withdrawal of the Costa Rican forces, but- he declined to accept the White award as a basis of settlement.Telegraphing [No. 128] from Washington on 3rd March, Sir Auckland Geddes said that the treaty of 1903 imposed on the United States the obligation of protecting Panana against aggression; but the State department did not consider that the -occupation of a disputed region such as Goto came within its terms.GEORGIA.The Situation.-On 20th February Colonel Stokes reported [telegram unnumberedj. that after burning nearly all the mission records, he had retired from Tiflis to Batum.
with the members of his mission, except Messrs. Rooker and Court, and all but a few of the British colony. This had been done in consequence, of a.communication, from the Government regarding the bad conditions at the front. He, himself had left in order to make sure, of communication with the; Foreign Office ; Messrs. Rooker and Court liacl been left at Tiflis to keep him informed as to the progress of affairs.Telegraphing again on 25th February [No. 66],- he said that he had received information of the entry of the. Bolsheviks into Tiflis. The Georgian Government,, -with Messrs. Rooker and Court, had left the town.GREECE.Smyrna and, Thrace. The following telegram [No: 101] was sent by Lord 1 Granvilie on 28th February : The reported decision of the conference to appoint a committee to enquire into the population, &amp;c, of the Smyrna region and Thrace has fallen here as a bomb-shell. The Government had a long discussion on Saturday evening, and it is announced that the National Assembly will be asked to decide on the instructions to be sent to-M. Calogeropoulos. All the newspapers publish articles in varying degrees of indignation, declaring unanimously that Greece must absolutely refuse to accept this decision, that she must fight, and that eveiy Greek of whatever party is ready to-sacrifice his blood and his money in the national cause.A very imposing demonstration, in which, 1 am informed, men of all parties participated, yesterday voted for a resolution protesting against the proposal of tke-conference, declaring the united and unchangeable decision of aR Greeks to impose-the respect for national rights recognized by the treaty of Sevres, and calling on the-Powers in the name of justice to recognize definitely the cession to Greece of the territories of Thrace and Smyrna which have been won by Greek blood. The demonstration visited the three allied legations and the palace and cheered for the respective countries and for war. I have received innumerable, telegrams from all over the country to the same effect.Telegraphing [No. 104] again on the following day he said : The National Assembly yesterday voted a resolution declaring that it is impossible-to accept a revision of the treaty of Sevres, which gives the minimum satisfaction to national rights ; and that it instructs the Government and the delegation in London to inform the allied Governments that the Hellenic, nation is grateful for the interest they have always shown in favour of the rights of Hellenism and is convinced that they will not insist on a proposal which Greece cannot possibly accept,Representatives of all parties spoke very strongly in the sense of this resolution.The only exceptions to the unanimity of the press are the socialist organs, which-clamour for peace and demobilization; one violent but unrespected Government paper, which maintains the old (? Hellenic) objection to &quot;colonial policy&quot; ; and one-independent paper, which argues that it would be a tactical error to reftise.Anti-Venizelists. On 4th March Lord Granville telegraphed [No. 109] as follows : In tbe National Assembly&apos;- yesterday the Government (group undecypherable) -deputy demanded that all royalist Greeks who had been deported from Egypt during-&quot;the war &quot; at the instigation of the Venizelists -&quot; should be indemnified by the British -Government. He also demanded the immediate recaU of certain Greek representatives. - in Egypt who. he declared were Venizelist, and in particular demanded the immediate expulsion within 24 hours of all A^enizelists still in the country. The Acting Minister d&apos;or Foreign Affairs replied that he meant to purify the service, but must have time.The first deputy declared that 90 per cent, of the officials in the ministry and the-diplomatic service were Venizelists, and another deputy pointed out that if these were all expelled their places could not be filled.The demand for indemnities, for the Greeks expeRecl. from Egypt was couched in language which amounted to a hardly veiled attack on Great Britain.Message fromM. Venizelos. On 4th March Lord Granville reported [No. 110] that -the press had published a message from Baris from M. Venizelos to the Greek people saying that his decision to retire -from  politics was irrevocable.    However the political situation might develop, he would in no circumstances return to political life..
Even if the. King were to abdicate in favour of the&apos;Crown Prince, or lie liimself were to be recalled by a popular vote, be would not alter this decision.The Venizelist press hails the decision as an exemplary act of self-effacing patriotism and one more effort to be useful to the country at this critical moment, and hints broadly that both the King and M. Gounaris should follow his example. The Government press declare the message to be an obvious manoeuvre to bring about the abdication of the King and to avoid all responsibility of what the future mav produce. They state that the situation is not altered, as the Greek people have alreadv driven M. Venizelos away, and are more determined than ever to retain the King and never to allow M. Venizelos to return.HUNGARY.Proposed Comviercial Convention with Bohemia. Mr. Hohler reported [No. 39] from Budapest on 24th February that the Czech representative had informed him that the Hungarian Government had postponed negotiations for a commercial convention with his Government until they had concluded one with Poland. This has now been done, though it has not yet been ratified ; and the Hungarian Government have suggested commencing negotiations at Prague at the eud of this month.PANAMA.V -Dispute with Costa Rica. See under &quot; Qosta Pica.&quot;.    PERSIA.The Coup d&apos;Etat [F.C.R., xxxvii, p. 7].-On 25th February Mr. Norman reported [No. 125] the issue of a declaration by the Shah, prompted thereto by Seyyid Zia-ud-Din, practically ascribing the movement to himself, and announcing the appointment of Seyyid Zia-ud-Din as Prime Minister, in order to terminate unstable government.The general outlines of Seyyid&apos;s policy, as confided to Mr. Norman, included the denunciation of the Anglo-Persian agreement, to be accompanied by a declaration that no hostility to Great Britain was implied. He contemplated the formation of a small army of 5,000 men at Kasvin, and wished to take over the South Persia Rifles at their present strength, but on a reduced scale of expenditure, with fewer British officers. He also hoped for the retention of British troops at Kasvin, pending the raising of new forces to replace them. Finally, he advocated the adoption by Great Britain of an attitude in which she would give effective help to Persia, but at the same time remain in the background. This he felt sure would ultimately gain most of the advantages for Great Britain which an impracticable agreement had been expected to supply.In reply to the above Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 91] on 28th February to Mr. Norman that the uncertainty of the conditions prevailing at Teheran made it preferable not to make any new departure. It appeared quite unnecessary to denounce an agreement which had never been submitted to the Medjliss, and had in fact lapsed through the inaction of the Persian Government, a point which was not disguised by the statement that the denunciation would not imply any hostility to Great Britain.    The withdrawal of the British forces at Kasvin could not be delayed.In acknowledgment [no number] on 3rd March of Lord Curzon&apos;s telegram,. Mr. Norman admitted that it was too early to guarantee the stability of the new Government, but did not hesitate to affirm that its success would be dependent in a great measure on the amount of help aud encouragement afforded to it by His Majesty&apos;s Government. In advocating such sympathetic treatment, Mr. Norman said that Seyyid was the first Prime,&apos; Minister who had ever made a serious attempt to introduce reforms, and so put Persia in a position to help herself, and he trusted that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be antagonized by the methods-used by him in order to attain office. The British community- at Teheran had hailed the new 26-2 B
situation with the greatest satisfaction as likely to be most favourable to British interests. He begged, therefore, that the abrogation of the Anglo-Persian agreement might not be allowed to stand in the way of extending to the new Government the much needed help and encouragement of His Maj esty&apos;s Government.The formation of a new army was a point to which the Prime Minister attached great importance, and for this purpose he was determined to employ British officers if possible, and he asked that their services up to the number of 20 might be lent to his Government.   Mr. Norman earnestly supported this application.Mr. Norman stated that the general opinion in Teheran, shared by himself, was that this was Persia&apos;s last chance and that nothing wotdd save the country from Bolshevism if she lost it.The New Cabinet. Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 137] on 3rd March that the new Cabinet had been formed as follows : Seyyid Zia-ud-Din - - Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior.Mudir-ul-Mulk - - Foreign Affairs.Nayyir-ul-Mulk - - Public Instruction.Mirza Isa Khan - - Finance.Muaidab-ed-Dowleh - - Public Health and Charity.Mushir Muazzam - - Posts and Telegraphs.Masud Khan - - - War.Muwaqqamd - Public Works.Mansur-es-Sultaneh - - Justice (acting).Policy of the New Government. Mr. Norman reported [No. 132] on 28th February that the Prime Minister had issued a long declaration, of which the following were the chief pxfints : 1. The credit for the establishment of the Cabinet and reforming the Government was attributed to tbe Shah.2. The liberation of the country from the necessity of borrowing abroad. 8. The re-constitution of the Administration of Justice and Finance.I. The division among the peasants of domain and Government lands, and legislation for the readjustment of relations between landlords and peasants with a view to the improvement of the position of the latter.5. The establishment of schools for the people.G. Tbe encouragement of trade and industry by scientific methods, and improved means of transport and communication-7. The establishment of municipalities.8. The formation of an army, on which special stress was laid.9. The eventual abolition of capitulations as soon as courts could be established fit to protect the rights of foreigners. (Prime Minister had. explained privately that this measure, to which the consent of other Powers would, of course, have to be obtained, was necessary because the Persian Government could not afford to have numbers of Armenians, Azerbaijans, Afghans and especially Russians living in the country but independent of local jurisdiction).10. Tbe reconsideration of some concessions granted to foreigners.II. Freedom to seek help from any foreign bower.12. The denunciation of the Anglo-Persian agreement. This clause contained a warm acknowledgment of the help rendered by Great Britain to Persia in the past, an an expression of the conviction that the denunciation would remove all-misunder-stan clings between the two peoples.13. The establishment of friendly relations with Russia,Consequence of Political Arrests [F.C.R., xxxvii, p. 7]. Referring to his report [No. 121] of 21st February, Mr. Norman telegraphed on 26th February as follows :  I have made repeated representations to the new Prime Minister on behalf of Farman Farina, Nosrat-ecl-Dowleh and Salari Lashkar, on the strength of the fact that the first two hold British decorations, and of the guarantee given to the second by His Majesty&apos;s Government on 9th August 1919, and I have obtained the promise that their lives Avill be spared, and claims against thehi presented without delay, as soon as the Government has been formed, after which they will be allowed to leave the -country in safety.I have now received a letter from Farmau Farina&apos;s chief wife asserting that her husband and eldest son possess other guarantees of British protection for themselves and their families, and appealing to me to obtain their release and to communicate
her petition to Your Lordship. Iwas previously unaware of the existence of-any further guarantees and am investigating the matter.There is no doubt that the three prisoners in question owe large sums to the Government for arrears of taxes, and I shall be unable to prevent these being claimed from them even if I have any ground for making the attempt.. It is also certain that if after their release they are allowed to remain in Persia, their presence will --constitute a danger to the present Government, and, indeed, to any Government in which they have no share.   I therefore see no chance of saving them from exile.Proposed Move by the Shah [F.G.R., xxxv, p. 5]. -Referring to the Shah&apos;s previous -desire to leave Teheran and the delay of his departure in deference to the pressure brought upon him, Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 142] ou 5th March that he had been informed by tbe Prime Minister that the Shah had again expressed his wish to visit Europe at an early date on the grounds of ill-health. The Shah had begged that Mr. Norman would recommend his request for the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, While attributing the desire less to ill-health than to apprehension of the future after the departure of the British troops, Mr. Norman considered that in existing circumstances it wordd be advisable to acquiesce. He thought the Shah intended to return after the formation of the Persian army which was hoped for, which would make Teheran a safe residence for him.POLAND.Signing of Conventions. -Mr. Max Midler telegraphed [No. 102] from Warsaw on 24th February : The Under-Secret ary for Foreign Affairs had informed him that according to a telegram received from M. Domsky, the following conventions were to be signed at Riga that day : 1. The convention of December for the repatriation of prisoners and hostages. 2. The convention prolonging the period for denouncing the armistice from two to six weeks.-3. The convention for the delimitation of the frontier by a joint commission.Certain notes will also be exchanged ; one of them regulating the repatriation of the Bolsheviks interned in East Prussia.Under the first convention the Poles will send five delegates with. 30 officials to Moscow, and the Bolsheviks will have a similar number in Warsaw. The delegates will have diplomatic privileges and the officials consular. Each delegation will have the right to despatch couriers.There are said to be about 500,000 Poles to be repatriated under the convention, -and 120,000 Bolsheviks.PORTUGAL.New Ministry. On 3rd March Sir Lancelot Carnegie reported [No. 21] that a new Ministry had been formed by Dr. Bernadino Machado, ex-President of the Republic, which included leading representatives of all political parties except the Liberals and the Socialists.   The &quot;Minister for Foreign Affairs remained unchanged.On the following day The Times correspondent telegraphed the following list of :the new ministrv : Senhor Bernadino Machado     - - Prime   Minister,   Interior,    and(provisionally) Agriculture.Senhor Alvaro de Castro         - - War.Senhor Lopes Cardoso -         .- . -..

s...... RUSSIA. .Message forM. Chicherin. On 25th February tbe following message from Lord&quot; Ourzon was sent [No. 20] to Mr. Leslie at Reval for transmission to M. Cnicherin :  -In my last telegram of 6th January I expressed my reluctance to continue-controversial discussion by telegram, which is attended with no practical result.   His Majesty&apos;s Government are awaiting the return of M. Krassin to this country in order to hear from him a detailed explanation of the latest Russian proposals, which cannot be advantageously dealt with in any other way.TURKEY.Christians and Nationalists in Anatolia. Sir Horace Rumbold sent the following telegram [No. 151] from Constantinople on 3rd March :  Deportations of Christians &quot;by the nationalist authorities continue to be reported from Anatolia. At Samsoun, at the beginning of February, the Greek Bishop Zilon (? and a group) of Greek notables, including the local manager of the Ottoman&apos;Bank and the sub-manager of the Regie, were arrested by the nationalists and deported to-the interior. On 11th February about 200 villagers of Merdigueuz and Yaemprkdere near Ismid were imprisoned in a church, ill-treated, and sent, to lz(? ni)k on the way to Angora.
