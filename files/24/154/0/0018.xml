FOREIGN  COUNTRIES   REPORT.GENERAL.The following paragraph is taken from the Report of the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 19th May : The International Labour Conference. The second session of the International Labour Conference takes place at Genoa on the 15th June. The conference will be occupied solely with questions relating to the conditions of. labour of maritime seamen, including those engaged on inland&apos;waterways. Among the subjects to be discussed are the question of the application of the Convention of the International Labour Conference held at Washington on the. 8-hour day and the 48-hour week, the application of the Convention and recommendations with regard to unemployment insurance, the application of the Convention with regard to the employment of children of less than 14 years of age, and the examination of the possibility of establishing an international status for seamen to enable them to land at any foreign port without formality. The conference will also consider questions of manning and accommodation and also the extent to which articles of agreement are made with sailors and the extent to which the observance of these agreements is insured by State supervision, trade union action or other means. At this conference all the States belonging to the International Labour Organization and to the League of Nations will be represented. Finland will also be represented^ with, however, only consultative powers.AFGHANISTAN.Unrest caused by Paper Money. The Viceroy of India reported on 26th May that unrest was being caused in Afghanistan by the circulation of paper money. Some merchants were recently imprisoned for refusing notes in payment for grain which they were selling in Kabul.Letter from the Amir to the Shah. Telegraphing from Teheran on 28th May [No. 318], Sir Percy Cox said that their Amir had sent a letter to the Shah the gist of which was as follows : On account of the despotic and avaricious world-conquering Powers having always regarded Pan-Islamism with suspicious disfavour, intimate relations between Persia and Afghanistan had hitherto been impossible, but now the latter had achieved her independence and sought closer relations with her neighbour. He was sending Sudar Abdul Aziz as his envoy (if acceptable, as a permanent one) and hoped that Persia would send a high dignitary as her representative in Afghanistan. He made no allusion to any treaty question, but concluded with a prayer for solidarity between the Islamic States.Indian Immigrants. On 2&apos;7th May the Viceroy reported that official instructions regarding Indians who emigrated to Afghanistan on account of the Caliphate question had been issued by the Amir. Such of them as should accept Afghan nationality were to receive various concessions of land and revenue, and all were to have equal rights with Afghans.Kandahar. On the same date the Viceroy also reported that Khairo Jan had been summoned from Baldak to Kandahar by the Governor ; defensive preparations round Spin Baldak were in progress ; and the officials were still preparing people for the possibility of a Jehad.Recruiting. The Viceroy further reported on the same date that the present output of the Kabul arsenal was reported to be less than 50 per cent, of the maximum; new battalions, however, continued to be recruited, and some 3.000 recruits had already been enlisted.ALBANIA.Coritza. Telegraphing from Salonica [No. 11] on 26th May Mr. Monckmason reported that a French officer had brought him a protest against the occupation of
the Coritza territory by Greece, which had been signed by the President of the Council of Notables and others on behalf of the population of that territory. The signatories complained that no communication had been made to them of any decision of the Peace Conference, and stated their resolve to resist to the uttermost. They appealed for British support.Mr. Monckmason further stated that he had been informed by the officer referred to above that orders to withdraw had been given to the French troops at Coritza.Telegraphing from Athens On 28th May [No. 129], Lord Granville said that Greek troops were due to occupy Coritza that day. Two days later he reported [No. 130] that the Greek General had reached the frontier of the^Coritza district and was there awaiting further instructions. M. Venezelos had informed the head of the French Military Mission that the British Government had told his Government not to occupy Coritza before the settlement of the whole Albanian question.On the following day he telegraphed [No. 130] again on the same subject. He had been told by the Foreign Minister that the French had been pressing them to occupy Coritza ; that the Greek Minister in London had been told at first unofficially that there would be ho objection to their doing so, but subsequently, whether officially or unofficially did not appear, that it would be better to postpone the occupation until the Peace Conference had reached a final decision ; and that M. Venezelos had determined to act on the British advice and wait, The Albanians regarded the Italians as their only enemies, and, the Foreign Minister said, had asked for the help of Greece against them. The Greek Government, however, had replied that they would not impair their friendly relations with Italy, though otherwise they were most willing to afford any help in their power.ARABIA.^ King Hussein and Ibn Sand. On 29th May Lord Allenby telegraphed [No. 520] saying that Colonel Vickery had reported that King Hussein, in a letter which was obviously written in an angry mood, had agreed to meet Ibn Sand. He had also promised (1) that no obstacles should be put in the way of pilgrims from Nejd provided that they came unarmed and were in charge of a responsible person ; (2) that he woidd maintain the truce with Ibn Saud.Lord Allenby thought that the meeting should take place as soon as possible.ARGENTINA.Possible Restriction of the Exportation of Wheat. On 20th May it was reported from Buenos Ay res [No. 112] that as a result of the outcry against the rising cost of bread the Argentine Government, were considering the partial or total restriction of the wheat export. It was rumoured that.the measure might take the form of a surtax on the export of wheat, the proceeds of which would be applied as a subsidy to millers. The surplus available for export was estimated at 1,900,000 tons. The price of wheat had fallen, though no official statement had been made.BALTIC STATES.Attitude of the French. Telegraphing from Riga on 19th May [No. 193] Colonel Tallents said that an impression that French policy had undergone a sharp change had been confirmed by the Lettish Minister for Foreign Affairs. France had. recognized Latvia and Lithuania de facto and had suggested the possibility of a de jure recognition; she was also sending a High Commissioner to the Baltic Provinces. Should such a de jure recognition be coming from the Allies, the Foreign Minister asked that Great Britain should be the first to announce the fact ; a request which Colonel Tallents strongly supported.Lithuania and Poland.-. Colonel Ward reported from Kovno on 28th May [No. 63] that Colonel Reboul of the French Military Mission had asked that Lithuania should promise that no military operations which would be embarrassing to Poland should be undertaken at the present juncture. This, the Foreign Minister said, could not be done ; the Poles were on Lithuanian soil, and Lithuania could not bind herself not l.o,take by force of arms what was hers by right.
Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 65], &quot;Colonel&apos;Ward said that the-French Government had instructed Colonel Reboul to press the Lithuanian Govera-ment.for a definite promise of neutrality. The Foreign Ministers position was that Lithuania must co-operate either with the Bolsheviks or with the Poles, neutrality being in his opinion a wrong policy. The Foreign Minister asked for Lord Curzon&apos;s: views and promised to take no action until they had been made known to him and he had also received news from the peace delegation in Moscow. Roughly, Lithuania would demand that Poland should make a declaration as to her independence, with Vilna as her capital ; that there should be a friendly discussion of boundaries on an ethnographical basis; and that the Poles should retire to the second demarcation line.In his telegram of 28th May Colonel Ward said that the Russian Government had stated that should Lithuania make a treaty with Poland, her territorial demands south of Vilna would be rejected, and the question of Vilna itself reconsidered.Telegraphing from Warsaw on 25th May [No. 350], Sir Horace Rumbold had reported that he had been informed by the Polish Foreign Minister that he was anxious that as many Polish troops as possible should be withdrawn from the-Lithuanian frontier, but there were still suspicions of Lithuania in the minds of some of the authorities. Marshal Pilsudski, too, had expressed to General Carton de Wiart. his wish for improved relations with Lithuania ; but Sir Horace said that he did not know how far this desire was connected with the present Polish operations against the Bolsheviks.Aland Islands [F.C.R., xvii., p. 10]. Mr. Kidston telegraphed [No. 475] from Helsingfors on 22nd May to the following effect. He had been informed by the Prime Minister that the local Diet of the Aland Islands would quite possibly in the near future declare their incorporation with Sweden ; and that the validity of such a declaration could not be recognized by the Government of Finland. His view was that the Swedish propaganda and the attitude of the islanders were due in a large measure to a conviction that the Great Powers would intervene in favour of Sweden if the agitation were carried on long enough ; and he therefore earnestly begged that the Great Powers should issue a declaration of want of interest in the Aland question. The Foreign Minister had also spoken to him in the same sense.Eastern Karelia. On 23rd May Mr. Kidston reported [No. 477] that the Finnish Government had telegraphed to M. Chicherin sharply protesting, against the reoccn-pation of Eastern Karelia by the Bolsheviks and demanding that the military status quo should be immediately restored.Telegraphing again [No. 482] on 27th May, Mr. Kidston said that in reply M. Chicherin had expressed regret that, owing to a misunderstanding, Finland was taking measures against Russia. He denied that the military status quo had been changed and hoped that the Finnish Government would disregard dangerous rumours spread by ill-wishers with the object of preventing the conclusion of peace. The Soviet Government could not recognize that Finland had any right to meddle in the affairs of Eastern Karelia, but they would consult with the workmen of that region as to their national aspirations. Nevertheless, while reserving all rights, they did not preclude the discussion of this and other questions pending between the two countries in the peace negotiations which they hoped would shortly begin.BULGARIA.Protest aqainst Greek Advance. Telegraphing [No. 54] from Sofia on 29th May,. Sir H. Dering reported that he had received a circular note that day from the Bulgarian Government, stating that Greek units had entered Gumuljina and were about to occupy the remainder of Western Thrace which is under the French military authorities. This (? territory) being an integral part -of Bulgaria until the day of entry into orjeration of the treat)7 of Neuilly, the Bulgarian Government considered that the Greek advance therein was in flagrant violation of the universal principles of inter-State relations. They had already protested without avail against the violation of Bulgarians southern rights and of the treaty of Neuilly, when Greek troops entered the Xanthi district, and must now renew the protest to the civilized world with the utmost energy, invoking the positive sense (sic) of treaties and the sacred authority of right,     . ...
Government Appeal on behalf of Refugees.-On the same date Sir Herbert tele-graphed [No. 55] that the Bulgarian Government had requested him to report to His Majesty&apos;s Government the terrible privations and sufferings of Bulgarian fugitives from Thrace entering Bulgaria. Long convoys from six specified villages, and others of the Gumuljina district, travelled through mud and rain over mountains, when Greek bands attacked, killing several and robbing them of all baggage and live stock. . Thus the Bykovo villagers alone had 25,000 animals stolen. Those of Chokmanovo&quot; were forced to leave their animals in the Xanthi district in the hands of the Greek authorities. The Hvaragach district is infested by Greek bands, who have killed a priest, a mayor, and three children, besides robbing convoys. The villagers near&apos; Adrianople who had not left their homes are terrorized by Greek bands seeking to drive them out of Integpitli, Savihoi and elsewhere. Refugees who could use the Orient railway Complain of the attitude of the Greek officials of this line, who are keeping them in thousands at Fere and Dedeagatch with all their baggage and effects. The Bulgarian Government appeal to the humanity of His Majesty&apos;s Government to eliminate, intervene, and terminate the sufferings of these unfortunate refugees. &apos;CZECIIO-SLOVAKIA.New Cabinet. On 26th May Sir George Clerk reported [No. 92] that a new Cabinet has been formed as follows : Social Democrats. Prime Minister and Minister of National Defence, Tusparam. Social Welfare, Winter. Education, Habrmann. Justice, Meisner. food, Johannes.   Minister without portfolio (for Slovakia), Derer.National Socialists. Foreign Affairs (? Ben)es. Railways, Stribrnyt. Public Works, Vrbensky.Agrarians. Interior, Svehla. Health and Unification, Srobar. Posts and Tele-graphs, Stanek.   Commerce, Sonntag. -Agriculture, Prasek.Non-Party. Minister of Finance, Englis. Minister charged with Foreign Trade without portfolio, Hotowetz.Election of President. On 28th Maj-, Sir George Clerk telegraphed [No. 94] that Dr. Masaryk had been elected President on the previous day in the combined House of Deputies and Senate by 284 votes out of 411. Mr. Neagle, Rector of the German University in Prague, had received 61 votes ; Mr. Muna, a Communist on trial for high treason, 4 ; a Slovak Communist, 2.   There were 60 blanks.DENMARK.Labourers against Unlawful Strikes. The following wireless message was received on 22ncl May : -The Labourers&apos; Common Organization and also the Socialist members of the Copenhagen Town Council have now turned earnestly against the unlawful dockers&apos; strike. Although there is no conflict at all between the strikers and the Town Council, it has not been possible to get ships carrying coal to the municipality unloaded. As the strike thus means danger not only to the winter supply but also to the whole municipal administration (hospitals, schools, almshouses, public kitchens, &amp;c), a Gfaitdatur meeting of 1,400 representatives of the Copenhagen trade unions, by an overwhelming majority, declared that the strike has nothing to do with the labour movement but is an attack on the Copenhagen working population, from which the majority of the Town Council emanated. The meeting, therefore, declared that if work was not resumed by Saturday, work should be regarded as free and open and also exhorted the Town Councils to enter upon arrangements with organized labourers in order to get the ships unloaded. The meeting promised such workers moral support.Christian Borglancl, who a few days ago was arrested on a charge of having threatened to use violence against young commercial clerks working on ships, w-as yesterday sentenced to prison for one month.GERMANY.Reorganization of Police. Mr. Rehnie reported [No. 28] from Allenstein, East Prussia, on 27th May, that the Commission were contemplating a scheme whereby 17-1 B
&quot;the present force would be reorganized for the plebiscite period. Each local detach-ment force would be under the orders of district officers and the whole force would be under the control of a British officer to be called Inspector-General. Police not entitled to the plebiscite vote would be dismissed, thereby permitting&quot; the enrolment of a certain number of Poles. It was thought that the above scheme might meet Polish demands, and the Commission desired that it should be brought into effect when the date of taking the plebiscite was fixed and published.Hidden Arms. Lord Kilmarnock reported [No. 311] from Berlin on 29th May that he had been told confidentially by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the German Government had been given information of two separate stocks of hidden arms, each said to consist of a million rifles. Endeavours were being made to dispose of them abroad, and the Government had information that a large sum of money had been placed to the credit of a foreign Consul, who was the present owner in one case, to be delivered to him when the sale had been effected. The Government were taking steps to locate the weapons and to put themselves in position to proceed against the offenders.GREECE.Thrace. On 29th May Lord Granville reported from Athens [No. 129] that Greek troops had occupied the whole of Western Thrace. And on the same day Admiral cle Robeck telegraphed from Constantinople [No, 639] as follows : Major Hey wood, of General Bridges&apos; staff, who has now returned from a journey of investigation in Western Thrace, where he saw General Charpy, reports thus on the situation: French troops have entirely evacuated Western Thrace, being relieved by Greeks, who have three battalions at Dedeagatch, two at Gumuljina, and one at Karagatch. The latter delayed proceeding to (group undeeyperable) owing to a fear of being cut off. The total Greek force available is three divisions, but great difficulty is anticipated in supplying this number. Two of these divisions are of good quality, the third is bad, and being of doubtful loyalty, will be.employed on the lines of communication.The French civilian administration of Western Thrace (which has been remarkably successful) has withdrawn. The Greeks have no staff of civilian administrators to replace the French, and control has apparently been left to the local inhabitants.The Bulgarian population of Western Thrace has emigrated in mass into Bulgaria, taking with them all property, including cattle and waggons. The harvest, which promised to be exceptionally good this year, cannot be collected, as the Bulgarians possessed practically all the means of transport. The railway, which was worked by a Bulgarian personnel, has discontinued service, and the employees have gone to Bulgaria. Similarly the telegraph service and the civil administration ceased functioning at midnight 28th-29th May. There has been a skirmish between the Greek troops and a Turkish band of some 50 men in the Xanthi district, in which both sides suffered casualties.Major Hey wood states that in General Charpy&apos;s opinion the Greeks are in a position to deal. with the situation in Western Thrace (? if all the other) Bulgarians who form the fighting element of the population have withdrawn and the Turks have (? decided) not to offer resistance.In (? Eastern) Thrace, Jaffar Tayar can at the present time dispose of 12,000 men to resist the Greeks. It is understood that he will occupy a line on the frontier south of Adrianople, and will dispute entry into the country. He has received arms from Bulgaria, and a French officer saw a park containing a large number of machine and field guns. In his orders he emphasizes that fighting will be diverted solely against the Greeks and not against the Allies. There are no allied troops now in JUastern Thrace west of Hadem Keui, which is near Constantinople.Coritza. See under &quot;Albania.&quot;HUNGARY.Treatment of Communists. On 25th May Mr. Hohler reported from Budapest [No. 310] that he had learnt through the Labour Party Deputation that 19 Communists had been killed on 29th April at Szolnok. the pretext being that they were endeavouring to escape ; also that a body of men had recently visited the. offices
of the lawyers defending the Communists now about to be tried, and carried off all their papers. He, Mr. Hohler, had remonstrated with the Prime Minister in the strongest terms.The Government and the Peace Treaty. Mr. Hohler reported [No. 326] from Budapest on 31st May that an address had been sent to him and his colleagues, signed by &quot; The Hungarian Youth,&apos;&apos; enclosing a protest which they have addressed to the Prime Minister, stating that if the present Government sign peace they have no right to represent the country ; they have kept the country calm until now, but they will not tolerate any Government which would dare to accept the present terms.Mr. Hohler did not attach much importance to this, which was very likely a move of Friedrichs, who had used similar language in the Chamber. But he feared that there were indications of increasing ferment among the demobilized officer and ex-soldier class, which threatened to create a division between the military element, using this term in the widest sense, and the established Government. The move seemed to him to have started,concurrently with the last phase of the Peace Treaty, and with the knowledge that the Hungarian Government would sign it, and could not be regarded with surprise, but it was dangerous, as the Horthy Government was none too-strong, and undoubtedly&apos; Bolshevik and other elements were ready to profit by any opportunity to stir up trouble. It was possible thus to imagine a situation when the Extremists would be in conflict, and the. moderating element powerless, though disposed to side with the military side.ITALY.Policy in the Caucasus. Sir G. Buchanan was instructed [No. 221] on 22nd May to inform the Italian Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government were unable to explain the Italian failure to fulfil their undertaking, made through Signor Nitti, to send a battalion to Batum, and to express the confident hope that it would be despatched forthwith. It had been remarked that the Italian flag was reported to be still flying at Baku, whereas the local Soviet authorities had arrested all the British in that place. This suggested that there had been some divergence of policy, and the failure to send the promised battalion to Batum tended to confirm this suggestion. His Maj esty&apos;s Government wished to learn, if, since the discussions at San Remo, the Italian Government had adopted any change of policy.Policy in the East. Telegraphing [No. 638] from Constantinople on 29th May, Admiral de Robeck stated that the following report had been transmitted by the Italian telegraphic agency, dated Rome, 27th May : M. Nitti, President of the Council, in an interview with the Matin correspondent at Rome, stated that Italy&apos;s policy in the East is and always has been based on the idea of not irritating or disturbing Moslems. M. Nitti added that, in the East, Italy was not seeking to secure any private aims and was acting loyally in concert with her Allies.PERSIA.Exchange of Communications- between Persia and Russia.-A wireless message from Moscow, dated 22ncl May, announced an exchange of Notes between the Persian Government and the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs in the following-terms ; The People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs have received a Note from the Persian Government in Teheran. This satisfaction about the 1918 (four words missed) Treaties with Persia. The Persian Government are anxious to conclude an early agreement with Soviet Russia, With this purpose two missions are leaving Teheran, one for Baku, the other for Moscow. The Persian. Government guarantee the unhindered entry into Persian ports of all steamers under Russian and Azerbaijan flags and their unhindered return to Russian waters. The Persian Government asks for the renewal of postal and telegraphic communications as well as commercial relations. In conclusion, the Note expresses its satisfaction at the friendly attitude of the Red Army towards the Persian population.The People&apos;s Commissary for Foreign Affairs, M. Ghicherin, has replied by a Note addressed to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which he expresses the Soviet Governments satisfaction at the Persian Governments decision to send to
Moscow a mission for the establishment of permanent diplomatic relations. The Soviet Government are ready to renew immediately postal and telegraphic relations with Persia, The policy of the Soviet Government towards the Persian people remains the same as that enunciated in the Note sent by the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to the Persian Ambassador in Petrograd on 14th January 1918, and the supplementary Note of 26th June 1919, in which the Soviet Government put down 16 points in which the Soviet Government indicated how far it was ready to make compensation for the injustice which the Persian people had suffered from the Tsarist and: Kerensky Governments. Although the Persian Government had officially recognized the Soviet Government by. (? the intermediary) of the Persian Ambassador in Petrograd on 4th January (new style) 1918, the Persian Government did not think it necessary to protest against the unheard-of crime perpetrated on a territory friendly to Soviet Russia when the representative of Soviet Russia was, in the summer of 1919, captured and shot on Persian territory by Russian counter-revolutionists supported by the English. But now that the Persian Government have expressed their wish to enter into diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia, our Government would like to receive definite guarantee that the Russian representative at Teheran and our consular representatives in Persia will be guaranteed and defended against any possible violence on the part of foreign troops still to be found on Persian territory.POLAND.Austrian Prisoners in Ukraina. On 21st May Sir Horace Rumbold reported that a member of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had stated that there were under-stood to be about 12,000 Austrian (? prisoners) in Ukraina ; that the Polish Govern-ment were taking all possible measures to expedite their repatriation ; that eight empty trains were being sent from Austria ; and that the Polish Government would provide supplies up to the Czecho-Slovak frontier. It was denied that the Polish Government had requested the Austrian Government to send eight trainloads of food.Poland and Lithuania. See under &quot;-Baltic States.&quot;PORTUGAL.Request for a Loan re.fused.-Orx 20th May Sir Lancelot Carnegie was instructed to inform the Portuguese Government that His Majesty:s Government had definitely decided, with the cessation of war expenditure, to grant no further Government loans to foreign countries, with the exception of relief credits in war areas. They regretted that they could not ask Parliament to depart in the case of Portugal from their publicly announced policy.Goal.   On 25th May Sir Lancelot Carnegie reported [No. 59] that the Acting-Minister for Foreign Affairs had spoken to him very bitterly in regard to the way (? Portugal) was being treated in respect of&apos; coal from the United Kingdom. He had given him a statement showing that while Italy and Belgium had respectively obtained last month 30 and 50 per cent, and France nearly all of what they got in the same month in 1913, Portugal had received only 13 per cent. He pointed out that the authorities were doing everything possible to diminish the consumption of coal, but that, nevertheless, in a short time the situation would become desperate unless supplies arrived:Portuguese East Africa [F.C.R., xvii., p. 8]. On 17th May the High Commis-sioner of South Africa reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that a later report from Inyanga stated that no further trouble was anticipated, and that the natives intended paying the tax as required by the Portuguese authorities.RUSSIA.Bolshevik Attitude towards the Allies. On 19th May Colonel Tallents, tele-graphing [No. 197] from Riga, said that an appreciable change in the Bolshevik orientation had been reported by the Lettish delegates who had been to Moscow. Their opinion was that the Bolsheviks were convinced that the Allies did not desire
peace, that conviction being based on the tendency of the latter to support rather than stay the Polish offensive. Their aims, therefore, were to establish a. connexion with Germany and to foment trouble in the East, The Lettish Foreign Minister had told him that the announcement that Latvia would proceed seriously to make peace with Germany had produced a relaxation of their difficulties in Moscow.The Lithuanian President had, Colonel Tallents also said, told him that their delegation in Moscow were convinced that the Bolshevik representatives spoke with the voice of Berlin.The Bolshevik Forces. Telegraphing on 28th May, Colonel Ward reported from Kovuo [No. 63] that the military position of the Bolsheviks was good, the discipline good, and the higher command first rate, according to information received from the Lithuanian peace delegation in Moscow, who also said that the battalion leaders Avere the weakest part of the machine. A great feeling of war patriotism prevailed. Given the non-intervention of the Allies, everyone was confident that the Poles would be beaten. The Russian forces would amount to 600,000 men, as the Crimean army was to be sent there.M. Ghicherin and the Amnesty of the White Guards. On 22nd May Mr. Leslie forwarded [No. 106] from Reval a wireless message for Lord Curzon from M. Chicherin, to the effect that the Russian Government would consider in a most friendly spirit the proposal for the amnesty of the remnant of the White Guards, Avhich would be put forward by the British representative during the impending armistice negotiations.Siberia.Message from the Foreign Minister of the &quot; Far Eastern Republic.&quot; On 18th May Mr. Alston telegraphed [No. 263] from Pekin as follows : A lengthy telegram of a dozen sheets, dated Verknudinsk, 6th May, has been recei\red here, addressed to the British High Commissioner in Siberia, and at other Legations, signed by Krasnoschakow as Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Far-Eastern Republic, announcing that, Avith a view to meeting the only condition precedent to the withdrawal of the Japanese Expeditionary Force after the evacuation of the Czechs, a convention of representatives has proclaimed the Far Eastern Provinces, including Trans-Baikal, Liaotung, Primorskaia, Sakhalin, Kamchatka and &quot;right of way of Chinese Eastern Railway,&quot; an independent State under a republican form of government Avfth representatiA^es of all political parties and nationalities. The programme includes the continuation of the relentless fight against reaction, the establishment of law and order, the convocation of a constitutional convention, an amnesty to the remnants of Kolchak&apos;s and Semeno\?&quot;&apos;s forces, the abolition of capital punishment, and friendly relations with all countries. It is requested that this telegram may be forwarded to your respective Governments with the request for a reply.I am endeavouring to ascertain how far this moArement is genuine. My Japanese colleague has not receiA&apos;ed a telegram and has no information in regard to it or to the propesal for a buffer State Avith which Krasnoschakow is associated.General Blair, who is passing through on the Avay to Shanghai, informs me that Krasnoschakow AAras formerly connected with the BolsheAnk activities at Blagovest-chensk and is believed to be an emigrant (Austrian) Jew from America. Krasnos-chakow&apos;s alias is Tobelsohn, details concerning Avhom are known at the War Office.SERBIA.The Cabinet. Sir A. Young reported [No. 127] on 17th May that Mr. Vesnitch had formed a Cabinet of concentration in AArhich Messrs. Protitch, Davidovitch and PribitcheAdtch hold important rjosts. Mr. Trumbitch remains titular Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mr. Mnitchitch, Minister of Commerce, will be acting Minister for Foreign Affairs.J ago-Slav Dispositions. Sir A. Yroung telegraphed [No. 153] on 31st May that some sensation had been caused by the statement in the Chamber, made on Friday by the President of the Council, that orders had been given to the Jugo-Slav army to hold themselves in readiness. He had asked at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs what was precisely meant by this statement. It was explained so long as loyal Italian troops remained batweea the Jugo-Slavs and D&apos;Annunzio nothing, of course, would happen, but if the Italian troops retired, or otherwise gave way, the Jugo-Slavs Avould 17-1 C
ibid themselves in direct contact with D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s troops, and would take action accordingly.Sir Alban understood at the Ministry of. War that no new military dispositions had been taken. News had just been received by telephone, and not officially confirmed, that Arditi had come into conflict with the loyal Italian troops at Susak. The situation was strained.SWEDEN&quot;. .Russian Trade Delegation. On 19th May Mr. Barclay telegraphed [Nos. 154 and 155] from Stockholm saying that on 14th May the Foreign Minister had addressed a message to M. Krasnin which the latter had approved. The substance of the message had been confidentially communicated to him by the Foreign Minister and was as follows :  -(1) The right to send a Swedish trade delegation to Russia on the basis of full reciprocity.(2) No political propaganda to be carried on by any of the members of the delegation or its experts.(3) The respective delegations and experts to be neither, subject to any authority nor subordinate to any person or corporation other than those of their home country.(4) The number of delegates, including experts, was not to exceed 15,&apos; with a reciprocal right of refusal of persons not considered personce grata&apos;. As communications are indispensable, the delegates will have the right to make use of the post and telegraph ; to send and receive cypher and wireless (? messages) ; and to receive and send correspondence up to three kilograms a week by a messenger who shall not be liable to be searched, and shall be recognized as a diplomatic courier provided that be is persona grata.(5) Russian vessels belonging to the Centro Sojus shall not be subjected in Swedish ports to less favourable treatment than other foreign vessels.(6) The Centro Sojus delegation shall be in a position to receive a legal summons in Sweden and agreements made between them and Swedish subjects shall be subject to Swedish law.(7) The Centro Sojus delegation to be received in Sweden when the Centro Sojus have obtained permission for the Swedish Export Association to send a trade delega-tion to Russia, and as soon as the security in gold stipulated in agreements concluded between the Centro Sojus and the above-mentioned Swedish exporters has been deposited with the latter; and the Swedish Government declare that they do not. intend, in order to cover any of their claims, to confiscate either this gold or goods sent by the Centro Sojus, subject to the condition that Swedish State property in Russia Legation house, Consulates, and contents be restored when the Swedish Government asks to take possession of them.As the above conditions apply solely to a trade delegation sent by the Centro Sojus, it is obvious&apos; that &quot; my above declaration &quot; in no way affects or prejudices the relations of the Swedish Government with the Soviet Government or claims or rights in Russia of the Swedish State or Swedish subjects.The Foreign Minister said that he presumed that there would be no objection on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government as the agreement was based on the decision of the Supreme Council. Mr. Barclay pointed out that the Swedish Government was giving diplomatic privileges as regarded telegrams in cypher and immunity for messengers ; to which the Foreign Minister replied that his Government wanted immunity for its own messengers, and that in Sweden anyone might use a cypher.SYRIA AND CILICIA.General Situation. On 21st May [No. 502] Lord Allenby reported that many refugees from the French area east of Tyre had come to our territory for safety. A most serious account of the situation in Syria and Cilicia had been given him by the French liaison officer, who said that the French contemplated the evacuation of one and the other. Telegraphing again on 26th May [No. 513], he said that he had been informed that day by the same official that the gravity of the situation was increasing.On 25th May Mr. Wratislaw telegraphed [No. 53] from Beirut saying that General Nouri Said, passing through that place en route from Paris to Damascus, was reported to have given out that the independence of Syria was assured.
TURKEY.The Peace Terms.  On 27th May Admiral de Robeck reported [No. 627] that the Grand Vizier had called upon. him the day before for the first time since the presentation of the peace terms.He said that the whole country regarded the treaty as excessively severe. He -urged the expediency and the justice of mitigating the conditions which deprived Turkey of Smyrna, Thrace and the coastal region from the Dardanelles to the Black Sea. If this part of the treaty could be softened it would be possible to secure its acceptance by the country, but if the Constantinople Government signed the treaty as it stood, the Sultan and the Government would, be placed in the extraordinarily difficult position of seeking to impose on the Nationalists in Asia Minor and Thrace a treaty which everyone alike considered unjust.The Grand Vizier had not received the full text and said it would be materially impossible to produce a considered reply by 11th June. He asked for a maximum prolongation of one month. He was going to approach the French and Italian High Commissioners similarly and confirm in writing.The Grand Vizier had asked him whether he could transmit a telegram from the Sultan to the King, entreating His Majesty, in conjunction with the heads of the other Allied States, to mitigate the treaty. He felt that he could not refuse, but said that he must inform his French and Italian colleagues.On the following day he telegraphed again [No. 631] saying: The recpiest for an extension of time in which to-reply to the peace terms has now been received from the Sublime Porte in writing. The Allied High Commissioners at their meeting-to-day decided that the application for an extension of one month to 11th July was reasonable and should be recommended for acceptance. The High Commissioners further considered that the facilities for sending delegates and couriers between Paris and Constantinople requires immediate attention as the train routine is not functioning satisfactorily.Admiral de Robeck added that the control of the train service between Paris and Constantinople was in French hands.Letter from the Sultan to His Majesty the King. On 27th May Admiral de Robeck also telegraphed [No. 628] the text of the Sultan&apos;s letter to His Majesty the King referred to in his telegram No. 627. In this letter the Sultan said that the whole of Turkey had been plunged into the depths of grief by the peace terms. He was encouraged by his absolute confidence in the justice and equity of His Majesty and the English nation, as well as by the wealth of the historical ties between the two empires, to make a pressing appeal to His Majesty to bring about an alleviation of the severity of the clauses which were incompatible with a state of independence, and to save the Turkish-speaking^provinces, at least, from partition.   ,The Nationalist Movement. -In his telegram of 27th May [No. 627] Admiral de Roheck also said that before speaking of peace, the Grand Vizier had explained his situation in regard to the repression of the Nationalist movement in Anatolia. He complained of the difficulties placed in the way of the organization of a regular force for the purpose, which difficulties he attributed neither to the British nor to the Allied authorities. He formally asked me to obtain the permission of the Supreme Council for the equipment and utilization of a force not exceeding 10,000 men. He said that he was about to address a similar request to the French and Italian High Commissioners. He emphasized the fact that the force asked for was much less than the 50,000 men contemplated as -the limit of the Turkish armed forces after the peace, and declared that his recent visit to Ismid had satisfied him that with such a force he could suppress the rebel movement, within three weeks.Nationalist Attitude in regard to Great Britain. Telegraphing on 25th May [No. 621], Admiral de Robeck said that all reports concurred as to the strong anti-British sentiment prevailing in Anatolia and more especially in the Brussa area. Apparently similar feelings did not exist against the Italians or, in spite of the happenings in Cilicia, against the French. The idea is spreading among the Turks that the Italians and French were unwilling to deal harshly with them, and that the drastic peace terms were clue to British insistence ; further that only the British back the steps taken hy the Turkish Government to suppress the Nationalist movement, Admiral de Robeck added that he doubted whether, in the event of a forward
movement bringing tbe Nationalists into conflict with us, the French and Italian naval and military commanders would co-operate in active hostilities against them without direct and categorical orders from their Governments.UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.Constantinople and the Straits. On 18th May Sir Auckland Geddes telegraphed [No. 373] saying that the Secretary of State had spoken to him about the control of Constantinople and the Straits, asking whether the proposed arrangements were considered satisfactory by the Allies. Sir Auckland said that he had replied that he believed that the Allies thought that America&apos;s unwillingness to assume responsibility being known, these proposals were the best of a series of bad possibilities. The Secretary then asked whether he thought that, should America be disposed to assume responsibility for Constantinople, the question might be reopened by the Supreme Council. Sir Auckland said that he had also been asked whether it was desirable to retain a nominal Turkish sovereignty in Constantinople, and that the Secretary of State had volunteered the opinion that this would be harmless if the Sultan remained there as a religious personage.URUGUAY.German Minister appointed. On 21st May Sir Claude Mallet telegraphed [No. 30] that he had been informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Mr. Gotsch had been appointed German Minister to. Uruguay.
