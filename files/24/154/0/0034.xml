FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN., Jemal Pasha&apos;s Mission [F.C.R., xxxiii, p. 2]. -In a telegram dated 6th January the Viceroy stated that it had been reported that Jemal Pasha had been sending agents to the tribal territory on the North-West Frontier. It was also reported that the Afridis and the Mohmands had been called upon to send small deputations to Kabul. ;ARABIA.Sherifian Activity.- On 4th January Sir Herbert Samuel telegraphed [No. 473] from Jerusalem as follows : The latest reports from Amman indicate a recrudescence of sherifian activity. A Circassian, Mirza Bey, has been made Pasha and. has issued orders for the recruitment of Circassians for the sherifian army. Some have enlisted, but it is considered unlikely that there will be much response. Wood for the railway and grain are being sent in some quantity to Maan and (&apos;? rumour) states that large numbers of camels have been purchased. The notice mentioned in my telegram .406 [B.E.R., xxxii, p. 3] is stated from all districts to have had a good deterrent effect. Subhikhadra is reported to have proceeded to Maan. A proclamation, headed &quot; to our Syrian brethren,&quot; signed by the Emir Abdullah, and dated 6th December 1920, inciting to a rising against the French was given to a Haifa newspaper for printing as a leaflet, but the order -was not accepted.ARMENIA.Treaty with Turkish Nationalists.- On 31st December Colonel Stokes telegraphed [No. 586] from Tiflis this summary of a treaty signed by delegates sent by the Armenian Government and the Turkish Nationalists at Alexandropol on 2nd December, communicated to him by M. Khatissian : (1) The independence, of the Armenian Republic is recognized within the frontier running roughly from Dangtap 8 miles north-east of Lake Chaldir, Bashshuragel on the Arpachai midway between Alexandropol and Agin, thence along the Arpachai to the Araks, and along the latter to a point 3 miles south-west of Ararat railway * station, thence to that railway station, thence south-east to Martigallos, thence to Chaikend.(2) The fate of the province of Kars and the district of Surmalourem is to be decided by a plebiscite within three years, meanwhile the available Armenian-Turkish gendarmerie is to police them.(3) Armenia denounces the treaty of Sevres, recalls from Europe the various delegations which signed it, and undertakes not to receive at Erivan representatives of the Entente until a peace treaty is signed between Turkey and the Entente.(I) The Armenian army is limited to 1,500 (? 15,000) men, but her gendarmerie is unlimited (? owing to) the conditions caused by the recent war.(9) Civil prisoners are to be repatriated forthwith; prisoners of war after the Lrontier is delimited.(10) All treaties made by Armenia which are directed against Turkey are annulled.(II) All refugees, excepting those guilty of crimes against Moslems, will be allowed to return to their homes within one year.(12) Armenians in Turkey and Moslems in Armenia are to enjoy the same rights as all other citizens.(13) Diplomatic and consular relations and telegraphic and telephonic communi-cation between Armenia and Turkey to be established immediately.
(14) The provinces of Itour and Nakhitchevan (? are) granted&apos; local autonomy under Turkish protection. They will decide their own fate on the lines of self-determination.(1.5) This treaty to be ratified within one month.(16) Armenian territory to he evacuated by the Turks progressively as the Armenian army is reduced to the strength indicated, in this treaty.AUSTRIA.General Situation. -The following telegram was sent from Vienna [No. 7] by-Mr. Lindley on 7th January : The Federal Chancellor called on me yesterday in order to put forward once again the absolute necessity of assistance from the Powers if a catastrophe was to be avoided. The continued rise in the exchange was making life impossible in Vienna, and State employees were all clamouring for rises in wages in order to meet the rise in prices. The Government could not accede to all these demands, however justified they might be, and indeed were, but a refusal would bring about general anarchy unless it were accompanied by the prospect of better times. He left with me a memorandum showing that the deficit, originally estimated at 12^ milliards, now stands at about 35 milliards. The Chancellor also visited my American, French, and Italian colleagues.I discussed the situation later with my French and American colleagues, and the British representatives on the Reparations Commission. The French Minister was much concerned at the situation and (? the United States Minister? showed me5 a telegram from Washington saying that the American Government would take no part in the forthcoming conference of the succession States. I. said that I had never believed the conference would affect the situation fundamentally, and that the only chance of its doing so depended on Austria entering the conference with the promise of assistance from the Powers. Without such a promise she would have nothing to offer the succession States with which&quot; to induce them to make economic concessions. Nevertheless I thought it important that one representative at least of the Great Powers should take part both in the preliminary conference to be held to draw up the programme, and in the conferences.As regards the general situation, I do not think more can. be said than that the catastrophe, which appears to be inevitable unless assistance is forthcoming from the Powers, is n month nearer than when I despatched my above-mentioned telegram. I am inclined to think that the immediate cause of breakdown will be the complete loss of confidence in the crown, which now stands at 2,400 to the  . It is impossible to say when this will occur. On the other hand the crisis may be precipitated by extensive strikes preventing food from reaching Vienna.THE CAUCASUS.Georgian Agreements. Telegraphing from Constantinople on 2Sth December [No. 590] Colonel Stokes reported that the Georgian Minister for Foreign Affairs had announced the conclusion of the following agreements made with the approval of the Allied Governments concerned : (1) With the British Bank of Foreign Trade for a loan of 1,505,000L(2) With a French syndicate for the organization of the silk industry.(3) With the Italian Discount Bank and Mining Company at Ilva for the exploita-tion of the coal mines at Tkvarchel.The. announcement has had a reassuring effect on public opinion, which argues that such agreements would not have been concluded did the Allies not wish Georgia to retain her mines. The immediate result has been a rise of the rouble from 20,000 to 16,000 for  .The North. Caucasian Tribes and the Turkish Nationalists. -On 30th December Colonel Stokes reported [No. 594] that, with a view to establishing closer relations-with the Turkish Nationalists, the north Caucasian tribes were sending delegations to5 Angora, aud that those from (group undecypherable)hens and Kabardins had already left Tiflis for Trebizond.   He further reported that M. Sittin, the military attache of
the Bolshevik mission at Tiflis, was recruiting Russian officers to send to Soviet Russia, To frighten recruits, aii endeavour was being made to prove that the Entente desired the destruction of Russia. An appeal was made to their patriotism and a full pardon guaranteed. Mam7 starving officers were accepting service. One form of employment offered was service with the irregular cavalry detachments -to be sent against the British in Persia.CHINA.The Japanese at Mukden. On 1st January Sir Beilby Alston reported from Peking [No. 1] that, according to the latest information from His Maj esty&apos;s Consul-Gen eral at Mukden, no withdrawal of Japanese troops had yet taken place, though negotiations bad been proceeding for some time past both with the Government at Peking and with the inspecting general in Manchuria. There were some indications that the Japanese were intentionally dragging out these negotiations in order to-postpone the evacuation.General Seminoffs Troops. Sir Beilby Alston telegraphed as foUows on 5th January [No. 4] : Some 8,000 men of Seminoff&apos;s and Kapel troops with 5,000 women and children have passed, or are passing, over the Chinese Eastern Railway into Primorsk. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Harbin reports that the last trainload has left Harbin, and the evacuation into Primorsk should be complete by 5th January. The men were all disarmed by the Chinese, but allowed to travel through Chinese territory on payment for transportation, despite some opposition from the Bolshevik organizations at Harbin.General SeminofPs men are said to be collecting at Grodekovo under the asgis-of the Japanese, but the Kapel troops are believed to be disinclined for Japanese tutelage and anxious to retain their independence.GERMANY.   &apos;Trouble with Government Employees. Lord Kilmarnock telegraphed from Berlin On 5th January [No. 2] that he had heard from a reliable source that it was confidently believed in Government circles that the present trouble with Government employees would be settled without a strike. The Government were prepared to make considerable concessions which were expected to cost four milliard marks annually -It was believed this would tide over the present crisis, but unless the cost of living-fell trouble was sure to recur in a few months. Meanwhile negotiations were proceeding, and the railway/ workers committee had issued an appeal to its supporters to avoid any action calculated to disturb their course.Lorcl Kilmarnock added that the voting which had been taking place was not directed to the question of an immediate strike, but to the question as to whether a strike should take place if a satisfactory result were not achieved by negotiation.HUNGARY.Request for the Intervention of the Allied Governments. On 30th December Mr. Hohler telegraphed from Budapest [No. 613] as follows : -According to information received by the Hungarian Government, the Czecho-Slovak Government have again given orders to destroy one of the (? double) railway lines between Legenye-Alsomihalyi and Mezolaborcz. This is a very important line of communication, especially for petrol coming from Poland,   They request the intervention of the Allied Governments,Provisional Economic Agreement with Germany. Telegraphing on 5th January TNo. 2a] Mr. Hohler reported that a provisional economic agreement with Germany had been ratified on 30th December. It was for a period of three months, but continued in force unless denounced by either party. The preamble stated that it had been made to regulate trade between the two countries, inasmuch as the -convention of 1905 had been annulled by the dissolution of, the Austro-Hungarian
- ; -      -   5 empire. It provided for most-favoured-nation treatment. Both parties retained entire freedom as to the imposition of customs dues. Railway traffic was to be regulated on the international^? convention) of Berne of 1890.Levy on -Deposits.-The fallowing telegrams were sent by Mr. Hohler on 5th and 9th January [Nos. 5 and 10], respectively :  (1) By a decree published on 18th December, 20 per cent, was levied on all moneys deposited in any way whatever in this country-, with, however, the specific exception of deposits, bank balance, or cash reserves of foreign subjects or firms, A decree has now appeared, dated 31st December, which cancels this, except in the case of foreign subjects and firms permanently resident or domiciled in Hungary.(2) I have discussed the matter with the Minister of Finance, who has now sent me a note stating that the Hungarian Government will not impose any levy on foreign companies or deposits, and the present secpieSters will be raised as soon as the legislation dealing with the question is passed, probabby about 1st March.PERSIA.Bolshevik Intrigue.-Regarding Bolshevik advances towards the Persian Government, on 5th January Mr. Norman sent the foRowing report [No. 9] : A Bolshevik mission composed of Valibegoff, the Governor of Nakchivan, a Russian named Mikhail-Yahgvitch (sic), and a Turkish officer named Hikmat Effendi, with 12 followers, reached Tabriz 9th December. They announced that Erivan had been declared a Soviet-Republic on 6th December, and pi&apos;etended that their mission was purely commercial, but they discussed political questions with the Governor-General.In reply to questions the Governor-General informed them that Persia had at first been encouraged by the proclamations and declarations of policy issued by the Kerensky Government, and later by the Soviet Government, to believe in the goodwill of Russia as reconstituted, but. that the invasion of Gilan by Bolshevik Nationalists, which had inflicted more injury and hardship on the peasants and labourers than upon any other class, had alarmed and disgusted the whole of Persia. Valibegoff replied disclaiming responsibility, and explaining that this movement had been the work of enemies of the Soviet Government, and that its leaders had been recalled to Moscow, where they would probably be executed.The mission pretended that a Bolshevik force remained in Persia lest the British should advance and obtain command of the Gaspian, and the Governor-General replied that there was nothing to fear on that score, but that the British had reason to fear that their own withdrawal would be followed by a Bolshevik advance on Baghdad. Valibegoff promised to report the result of this conversation to Moscow, with a view to the removal of the cause of complaint.The mission&apos;s chief object appears to have been to obtain sanction to the ajjpoint-ment of a Bolshevik consul at Tabriz, and apparently of a consular agent at Maku and Ehoi. The Governor-General replied to this proposal that he was not competent to decide such a question, which must be referred to Teheran, but he explained at length that as the condition of Persia differed from that of Russia, and &quot;she was not ready to receive communist ideas, it would be preferable that any consul who might be appointed should be a man of moderate views.Valibegoff told him that the Soviet Government had abandoned the policy of attempting to enforce their system on other countries (groups omitted) subject of exchange of exports. They had brought with them rice, cotton and copper tools, and the Governor-General arranged for delivery to them, on their return to dulfa, of 50 kharvars of wheat and a similar quantity of barley. Circumstances compelled him to ignore the impudence of the mission in offering part of the-spoils of (groups omitted) expedition for barter in Persia. Mikhail-Yangvitch, the Russian, added that tiny feared the introduction of British submarines into the Caspian, and warned the Governor-General that an alliance between Persia and any other Power would be regarded by the Soviet Government as a hostile act, and the mission stigmatized the present Cabinet as pro-British.The mission left 13th December, leaving one member behind, probably to act as a propagandist.Retirement of British Troops. In reference to the question of the withdrawal of British troops from North-West Persia, Lord Curzon, in a telegram [No. 5] to Mr. 24-2 B
Norman, dated 3rd Januaiy, pointed to tlie necessity of considering the policy to be followed in view of the results which might ensue from such a withdrawal. While the negotiations known to be pending between the Persian antP Soviet Governments suggested some doubt whether a Bolshevik advance on &quot;Teheran would immediately follow the British retirement, it could hardly be expected that the Russians would forgo so attractive an opportunity. Military forces would not be available to resist such an advance. The Persian Government had deliberately rejected the chance of raising a Persian force under British officers, and as the period of grace for a meeting of the Medjliss to approve the Anglo-Persian agreement had been allowed to expire, no assistance from that source could be looked for. It only remained to consider British interests as far as the situation permitted, with a view of protecting them in the centre and in the south, and of preserving as much of the country as possible from Bolshevik aggression. Lord Curzon then suggested the following points for Mr. Norrnan&apos;s consideration :   (1) The gradual evacuation, by the Hamad an route, of all members of the British colony whose presence in North-West Persia was not essential; (2) the remaining of the Legation and other members of the colony in Teheran as long as possible ; (3) the withdrawal to Ispahan, if and when residence in Teheran was no longer expedient. Lord Curzon pointed out that much would depend on the decision arrived at by the Shab and the Persian Government as to whether they would feel strong enough to remain in Teheran, or would move to another city in the south. Mr. Norman&apos;s views on these&quot; points were invited.. Telegraphing [No. 8] on 5th January, Lord Curzon informed Mr. Norman that the Cabinet had decided that military evacuation would commence on or about 1st April, and pointed out that, while the evacuation of Europeans might still not be essential, consideration should be given to the southern as well as to the western route.In reply to Lord Curzon&apos;s telegram [No. 5], Mr. Norman reported [No. 16] on 6th January that the Prime Minister proposed to submit the Anglo-Persian agreement to the Medjliss which was expected to open very soon, and that he was not without hope of a successful issue. Mr. Norman himself continued to think that this was improbable.In further reply to Lord CurzoiPs telegrams [Nos. 5 and 8] Mr. Norman, on 8th January [No. 17], stated his views on the measures suggested for his consideration. With regard to the evacuation of Europeans and Americans whose presence was not essential he was strongly in favour of it. The officer commanding Norperforce agreed with him and was making the necessary arrangements. He concurred in the Legations remaining as long as they could do so in safety. But it was the general conviction of those whom be had consulted, Persians and Europeans alike, that the withdrawal of British troops would be followed immediately by a Bolshevik occupation, whether a Persian-Soviet agreement was signed or not. The large influx of Russian and other Bolsheviks that had already  taken place might be sufficient to create clanger even without further Bolshevik accessions. Consequently7 it was the general belief that it would be impossible to maintain an ordered Persian Government in Teheran or to establish one elsewhere. The Prime Minister, Mr. Norman stated, thought such a Government might be formed at Ispahan, and might rely on the help of gendarmerie for protection. Mr. Norman doubted the practicability of this plan as tbe gendarmerie were not to be trusted, and, except in so far as their interests in the oilfields were concerned, the Bakhtiari were decidedly7 unfriendly and unreliable. He advocated Shiraz as the most suitable seat for a non-Bolshevik Government, partly on account of its stragetical position and partly on account of the presence there of the South Persia Rifles.Proposed Move of the Government.  On 7th Januaiy Mr. Norman reported [No. 14] that the: Shah, who had taken fright at the intended evacuation ot non-essential jDersons, had sent for him, and had endeavoured to persuade him to agree to the Shah&apos;s departure at once, or else to his abdication. The Shah adduced arguments in support of his proposal, which showed that he was nervous about his own safety7 should the Bolsheviks come to Teheran, as they7 certainly7 would on the retirement of the British troops. If he went south ancLfelbinto tbe hands of the Bakhtiari, he -would fare no better ; he definitely7 declined therefore to go to Ispahan in any7 circum-stances should the Persian Government move there.Mr. Norman succeeded temporarily7 in allaying the ShalPs fears, and induced him to postpone a decision so as to give time for reflection, with the promise that he shoukb
be given a montli&apos;s -warning of the date on which the withdrawal of. the troops,woidd begin. - .Telegraphing [No. 20] on 9th January, Mr. Norman said that the Prime Minister had conveyed a message to him from the Shah, that the latter had decided to move the Government to Shiraz by way of Ispahan, and threatening flight to Mesopotamia if Mr. Norman did not consent to this arrangement, An assembly of notables was to be summoned for the .1.1th January to decide on the matter. The Prime Minister regarded the proposed transfer as the best way out of the present difficulty.-Mr. Norman returned a message calling the Shah&apos;s attention to his own promise, and declining- to be forced to a decision of such importance without having time to consult-,-Lord Curzon. Mr. Norman expressed his doubt whether this would have any restraining effect on the Shah.POLAND.Traffic between Poland and Germany. On 2nd January Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed [Nos. 5 and 6] the following- summary of a communique issued by the Polish Ministry for Foreign Affairs making known that the principles.&apos;of an understanding between the Polish and German Governments regarding traffic between Germany and East Prussia had been agreed upon.Traffic will be divided into two categories : (1) Special transit traffic. This will be effected in special trains guarded by customs officers. During the passage through Polish territory passengers will not be allowed to alight from their carriages; goods wagons will be sealed; there will be no customs formalities.(2) Ordinary transit- traffic. This will take place in ordinary trains, on waterways, or by road. The passports of passengers will be vised by Polish Consuls for a fixed period ; passengers will be subject- to a customs examination.Railway lines for transit traffic, fares and freights, and general regulations have been settled. Goods traffic will be arranged in accordance with the regulations of the Berne Convention. During the first five years Germany undertakes to lease to Poland a certain number of locomotives for this traffic.Negotiations for regulating the transport of troops are proceeding.By the Polish-Danzig convention Germany obtained the right of. transit traffic through the territory of the free city. In virtue of Article 6, Poland has become Dahzig&apos;s mandatory for the settlement of this question with Germany, but she has to consult the Danzig authorities first.As the delegates who signed the convention in Paris had no powers, and as the agreements regarding the railways had to be signed there, the Polish delegates requested the Danzig Senate to send delegates with full powers. This was refused; but it is hoped that delegates will arrive as the Poles have protested.The technical side of the question is settled, but there still exist considerable differences of a political character. It will be impossible to sign the agreement on 10th January as laid, down in the Treaty of Versailles.Poland will obtain by this agreement transit facilities through German territory between Poland and Danzig.Resignation of the Vice-President. On 5th January Sir Percy Loraine reported [No. .1.1] that the Chief of the State had officially accepted the resignation of the Socialist Vice-President of the Council, M Daszynski.RUMANIA.Rumania and Rvsskc-The following is a translation of a wireless message sent by M. Take Jonescu to M. Chicherin on 5th January in reply to the latter&apos;s message of 25th December [F.C.R., xxxiii, p. 5]: I take note with pleasure of your radio of 25th December, giving an assurance as to the concentration of Russian troops near our Dniester frontier. In my turn I repeat what I have several times already told you, that Rumania has no intention of departing from the obligations imposed on her by international law of absolute
neutrality towards Russia.   This implies persistence on our part in our-point of view as to Rumania not being at war with Russia, the two notes which you sent us on 2nd May 1920 not being considered as having created between Rumania and Russia a state of things from the international point of view other than that existing prior to-these two notes.   In our view the question at issue is not that of negotiating between Russia and Rumania a peace which has never ceased to exist, but to settle questions which might arise between the two countries in consequence of the events which have-taken place during the last few years.   I beg that you will let me know if you share this point of view.   If so, I shall propose to you that contact shall first be established with a view to ascertaining what questions in your opinion should form the subject of the pourparlers between the two countries.   In any case, whatever may be your reply, I attach importance to repeating that the attitude which the Rumanian Government have hitherto observed, and will continue to observe, towards the affairs of their-neighbours, is that of a state which does not mix itself up in their affairs, or cherish any hostile intention against them.RUSSIA.Communications between M. Chicherin and Lord Curzon. On 31st December M. Chicherin sent this wireless message : The Russian Government, waiting in vain for a reply to its notes of 9th November and 4th December, and reiterating its readiness to enter at any moment into formal negotiations by properly authorised persons on the political problems contained in the agreement arrived at by the exchange of notes of 30th June and 7th July, has now learned with great surprise from a wireless report that, in the course of a statement made by Sir Robert Home in the House of Commons on behalf of the-British Government, the  blame  for  the  delay in  reaching   a trade agreement was  thrown upon  the  Russian Government, which  moreover is  called  upon  to furnish  proofs   of its   good   faith by accepting  the  extended   and  amplified version of the political preamble  to the above-mentioned  provisional  agreement which has been suggested  by the  British  Government.    This  statement is so entirely at variance with the facts that the Russian Government feel bound to take notice of it and to enter a most emphatic protest against it.    It would  appear -  that in the opinion of the British Government any refusal by the Russian Govern-ment to accept without proper and adequate discussion any interpretation it may arbitrarily give  to  parts of  the   said  preamble,   or  to  accept  as  proper  and adequate   such  discussion  as  the  British  Government  may have a  preference-for, constitutes an act of obstruction and bad faith.   The Russian Government,, representing as it does tbe toiling millions of the Russian peasantry and working class, and strengthened by the unanimous vote of the 3,000 delegates to the eighth All-Russian Congress, of the Soviets which has just closed, begs to state that it represents an independent and sovereign nation, and is not bound either in law or in force to-accept the views of the British Government on matters under discussion between the two countries implicitly and without demur.   At the risk of repeating what it has already said in its previous notes, it must again point out that the sole responsibility for the long drawn out negotiations lies entirely with the British Government, which first found in the Polish-Russian conflict a pretext for not giving effect to the provisions of the June-July agreement and afterwards eliminated the political section of the Russian delegation.   In face of these facts, known to all the world, and-the long-record of conspiracies and acts of intervention in violation of all the laws of nations-on the part of. the Allied Governments, it is certainly not for the British but for the-Russian Government to exact proofs of good faith, which has again and again declared its readiness to let bygones be bygones, and to open a new chapter of peace and trade for the whole world.   While repudiating- the idea of accepting without properly conducted negotiations any modification or amplification of the June-July agreement,, or any new terms, the Soviet Government, even now, in spite of the changed situation, maintains its readiness to abide by the above agreement   with the  subsequent elaboration  of  the  political  clauses   by - special  conference   between   the  two Governments.On 6th January Lord Curzon sent the following reply through Mr. Leslie at Reval [No. 5] :-The Soviet Government in the latest of its numerous contentious notes, which are published to the world for an obvious reason, repeats the assertion that the sole-
responsibility for tbe long drawn ont negotiations lies with the British Government. This assertion is so completely at variance with the facts that it seems necessary for the last time to refute it.The first decision to open up trade with Russia was taken by the Supreme Council - on 16th January. Telegrams were immediately exchanged between the Russian Co-operatives in Europe apd their headquarters in Moscow, and there was every prospect of speedy success until, by the Centrosoyuz telegram from Moscow of 25th February, His Majesty&apos;s Government were informed that changes had just been made in the constitution of the Centrosoyuz, and that M. Litvinoff hack been appointed ;. as its chief representative abroad. The Soviet Government knew well that it would not be possible for the British Government, after their previous experiences of M. Litvinoffs activities, to receive that gentleman in this country. Nevertheless, His Majesty&apos;s Government sent a special delegation to Copenhagen in order to endeavour, to arrive at a modus vivendi with him. The result was the Supreme Couucifs second decision of 26th April. The brief delay which intervened between this decision and the arrival of M. Krassin in England was again solely due to the Soviet Government attempting to re-insist on the acceptance of M. Litvinoff. The negotiations which followed with M. Krassin resulted in His Majesty&apos;s Government^ note of 30th June outlining the conditions on which a trade agreement could be concluded, and the acceptance of these conditions by the Soviet Government on 7th July should have led to an early conclusion of the matter.Unfortunately the Polish episode intervened ; and - the attitude aud conduct of the Soviet Government, which have been repeatedly exposed, were such as to render the resumption of peaceful negotiations for the moment impossible. A few weeks later, as soon as the Soviet Government had agreed to an armistice with Poland, His Majesty&apos;s Government placed a man-of-war at the disposal of the Russian trade delegation for their return to England. Further, in their desire for amicable afrange-ments on an even wider field, His Majesty&apos;s Government not only accepted M. Kameneff, but also proposed that he should be vested with powers to discuss the preliminary arrangements for a peace conference. M. Kameneff, however, proved to be far more interested in the internal politics of Great Britain than in Russo-British relations. Moreover, at a critical moment he grossly deceived the British Prime Minister on the subject of the Soviet peace terms to Poland and this in spite of the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government had been using every endeavour to persuade Poland to accept reasonable conditions. M, kamenoffs behaviour resulted in his withdrawal from the scene, and in a further suspension of negotiations.The long delay which followed was due almost entirely to the Soviet Governments treatment of British subjects in the territories under its control or subject to its . influence. The facts were fully set forth in my telegram of 1st October and in the subsequent correspondence. As soon, however, as the exchange of prisoners was well under way, negotiations for the trade agreement were resumed with M. Krassin, and the fact that the-agreement still remains unsigned is due in the main to the persistent equivocation of the Soviet Government in regard to the conditions which it had itself accepted on 7th July.The question of the interpretation of the agreement of 30th June 7th July has been the subject of repeated discussions with M. Krassin, who is well aware of the reasons for which His Majesty&apos;s Government must insist upon inserting in the preamble of the proposed agreement a specific reference to the geographical areas to which the repeated pledges of the Soviet Government to desist Rom propaganda or hostile activities directed against British interests or the British Empire must in particular apply. A mere general assurance without any such specification will carry little value and can only lead to prolonged and possibly futile controversies with regard to every arena that is afterwards claimed as falling within its scope. These controversies should, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, be guarded against, in advance rather than referred to a political conference at a later stage an obvious excuse for protracted dispute and interminable delay. Should the Soviet Government intend to carry out its assurances with bond fides there cannot be the slightest-objection in the. interest of both parties to defining in broad terms the areas to which they are intended more specifically to refer. For their part His Majesty&apos;s Government have expressed their willingness to consider any analogous geographical definition, where a special interest can fairly be claimed by the Soviet Government of Russiajas&apos; the basis of a corresponding obligation entered into by Great Britain.In these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government entertain the hope that instead, of continuing a barren polemic, the Soviet authorities will empower M. Krassin to24--2 &apos;      c . &apos;   ------ :       &quot;        7        &apos;-   -
sign the trade agreement upon his return, and that in its execution may be found not merely a gauge of the sincerity of both parties, but the first step towards the reconstruction of the material prosperity of Eastern Europe.To this in turn M. Chicherin sent a lengthy reply on 10th January. He stated that his Government was compelled to abide by the assertion that the British Government was responsible for the delay; that M. Litvinoffs non-admittance could only be regarded as .a deliberate attempt to- obstruct the restoration of peaceful relations between the two peoples; and that the delay in M. Krassins departure for Copenhagen was due entirely to the acts of the British Government. The Soviet Government once more protested against the &quot;groundless &quot; accusations made against M, Kameneff; it believed that the British Government had been deceived by officials of the Tsarist Government ; and finally, it had no more sincere desire than the establishment of trade and peace with Great Britain.According to a message from Beval [No. 1], this reply was written by M. Litvinoff, acting under M. Chicherin&apos;s instructions.The Trade Agreement. Telegraphing from Reval on 10th January [No. 1], Mr. Lonergan said that he had been informed by a reliable Englishman who had just met M.

The sincere desire of the former for an alliance in the matter is shown by the fact that on 22nd November it asked the latter&apos;s opinion as to whether it should enter into friendly relations with Georgia. Further, it asked the lattePs opinion as to the peace proposals from Constantinople made with British consent. On neither point has Moscow replied. Angora has accordingly refrained from entering into any agreement in either case, but meanwhile it learns that Moscow is about to sign a treaty with England. In order to calm Turkish public opinion it will be glad to know the significance of this treaty.The American High Commissioner- at Constantinople is continually sencling ageuts to Turkish ports in order to reopen commercial relations. Angora has replied that it is willing to do this if America &quot; recognizes the Angora Government and the economic and political independence of Anatolia.&quot; Angora also desires to know what is the policy of Moscow in regard to Armenia. Angora wished only to annex provinces populated by Turks, and the treaty it made with Armenia is based on the principle of the independence of peoples. It now learns that, &quot; in view of the change in regime in Armenia (group omitted), which is probably temporary,&quot; Moscow wishes to revise the treaty and hand back to Armenia provinces inhabited by Turks. A prompt answer is requested.URUGUAY.German Enquiries in regard to a Loan.
