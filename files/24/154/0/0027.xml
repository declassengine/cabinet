FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Internal Affairs [F.C.R., xxvi, p. 2].-Telegraphing [No. 213] on 30th September,, the Viceroy reported that the intelligence from Kabul was that Tarsi had announced the decision to make peace with the British. This ; announcement was made at a durbar held by the Amir on 22nd September. The differences between^Tarsi and Nadir Khan were said to have been removed by the intervention of the Amir.ARABIA.King Hussein and Syria [F.O.R., xxiii, p. 2]. Sir Herbert Samuel reported [No. 268] from Jerusalem on 21st September that his advice had been asked by Rafanan Pasha of Kerak concerning an appeal addressed to him and to all the sheiks of Kerak, Adwan and Belka, signed by King Hussein. The purport of this appeal was that the time had come for them to show their ardour and zeal in connexion with their country and their religion. They were exhorted to unite and to assist their co-religionists in delivering the country from the infidels. They were informed that one of King Hussehfs sons was coming to them with money and food, and peace was invoked on them. The appeal was signed Hussein, son of Ali, King of Hejaz, 7th September 1920.Sir Herbert has not yet reported any evidence of a response to this appeal.King Hussein s Subsidy [F.O.R., xxiv, p. 2]. Telegraphing [No. 933] from Cairo on 23rd September, Mr. Scott announced that King Hussein had stated his willingness to instruct Lutfallah to sign the Peace Treaty if His Maj esty&apos;s Government would fulfil their engagements. He complained of the refusal to let him have aeroplanes, and the neglect of replies to his queries as to whether Great Britain stood by its undertakings with him. In view of the Prime MinisteFs refusal to meet Feisal, the only course open to him was to resign. King Hussein appeared to be insensible to the attempted moderating influence of the Emir Abdullah.In acknowledgment of the above Mr. Scott was informed by telegram [No. 835] from the Foreign Office on 28&apos;th September, that he was authorized to make an immediate payment of 10,000Z. to King Hussein, provided an undertaking was given that the money wordd be expended in the Hejaz only. Sanction was given for the payment of a further 10,000Z. on King Hussein undertaking to sign the Peace Treaty, the remaining 10,000Z. to be paid when he had actually done so.On 30th September Mr. Scott telegraphed [No. 966] that reports had been received of Abdu]lah&apos;s departure for Medina. Recruiting was proceeding in the Hejaz, and two camel corps parties had left Mecca on 23rd September, but their destination was not definitely known. Information from various sources indicated that King Hussein was in communication with Mustafa Kemal. Mr. Scott advocated addressing a warning to King Hussein against sending any assistance to the Syrians or interfering politically outside the Hejaz, and that by any such action he would certainly incur the displeasure of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the Allies.In view of the information contained in the preceding telegram, Mr. Scott referred [No. 967] to the Foreign Office on the same date, as to whether it would modify the instructions given in their telegram [No. 835]. He suggested that as the promise of the prompt payment of 30,000Z. on his signing the treaty had already failed to move King Hussein, it was unlikely that the conditions accompanying the payment as described in this telegram would be any more successful. Mr. Scott gave it as his opinion that the reception of Feisal by the Prime Minister might have a very good effect.The Imam and Idrisi.- Tbe Resident at Aden telegraphed on 30th September [No. 352 A.P.] that the Imam was collecting troops for the capture of Obal and Bajil, and that Idrisi had been driven back at three points. The capture of Bajil by^ the Imam would necessitate the withdrawal of Idrisi to Zaidiyih, leaving Hodeidak
exposed. It was reported that the merchants of the last-named place were intriguing with the Imam and Mahmud Nadhim, formerly Turkish Governor of Yemen; the latter was said to&apos; have announced that he had a commission to reconquer Tehama for Turkey, arid to have&apos; already taken some Turkish troops to Meriakha. ,ARGENTINA.Expropriation Bill [F.C.R., xxry,.p...21-Qn..2nd October Mr. Macleay telegraphed [No. 191] from Buenos Ayres as foRows&apos;:1- &apos;-The Seriate, having insisted on amendments in the Sugar Expropriation Bill which virtually annulled the measure, the only means open to the Government to- carry out their original bid unahiended over; the heads of the Senate was by securino- a two-thirds majority vote in the Chamber of Deputies. On 29th September &quot;the Chamber voted for the postponement sine die of the consideration of the measure. This step was taken evidently at the instigation of the Government, who had reason to believe that they would not secure the necessary two-thirds majority. Unless the President insists on the bill being proceeded with in extraordinary sessions, the effect of the Chamber&apos;s action is.to shelve the question iintilnext May. &apos;AUSTRIA.The Plebiscite Area [F.C.R., xxvi, pp. 3, 4, 5]. On 21st September Lord Derby transmitted [No. 1114] to the Foreign Office a copy of a telegram sent by him to Colonel Peck at Klagenfurt: The French have approached us unofficially on the subject of the presence of Italianlroops at Villach, They comment jdu the fact that the Austrian Government have never protested against, the presence of these troops in Austrian territory, and fear that there may be some arrangement between the Austrians and Italians for bringing them into the plebiscite zone at the last moment to suppress disturbances which may be engineered shortly before the date of the plebiscite. It may be in order to prepare the way for this that the Austrian Legation here have recently addressed two notes to the Conference of Ambassadors, urging- the necessity of sending- Allied troops to the plebiscite area to ensure order. As it is impossible, as they know, to send British or French troops, it will next be argued that the Italian troops at Villach are the only alternative.I should be glad of your views as to the above-mentioned contingency, and as to the possibility of a collision between the Italian and Jugo-Siav troops if the former entered the zone.It would make it easier for me to ask for the withdrawal of the Italian troops if I could base my request on a formal recommendation in this sense by the majority of the commission.Two days later Colonel Peck telegraphed [No. 26] the text of his reply to the above : Neither he nor his French colleague felt himseR in a position to bring forward the official recommendation suggested by Lord Derby. The attention of the commission had been called, on two occasions, to the presence of Italian troops at Villach ; and on each of them his French colleague had agreed with his own view, that it was not a matter of which they could take official cognizance, as the troops were not within the area controlled by them. It was further his own personal view that though the presence of these troops at Villach affected the policy of the Jugo-Slav authorities in Klagenfurt; it did not directly affect the voting of individuals at the plebiscite.He had no doubt that if the Italians entered the plebiscite zone alone the Jugo-Slav troops would return immediately, and an ultimate collision would be probable if not certain; in fact, he could not express too strongly his conviction that to send. Itahan troops into the area without British or French would be disastrous, and. that with them it would be difficult.On 23rd September Mr, Kennard reported [No. 430] from Rome that the Italian Government were prepared gradually to remove the Italian troops from the Villach-Stveif line when the Jugo-Slavs had not only evacuated their zone of occupation in the
plebiscite area, but also Assling. The evacuation could only be gradual to enable the Italian troops to be replaced by Austrians.A copy of this was transmitted to Colonel Peck, who on 27th September telegraphed saying that a gradual evacuation of Italian troops would be useless as the plebiscite-must take place before 11th October, and further that the evacuation of Assling could not be brought about without prolonged deliberation; in fact, .it was very unlikely that it would be agreed to by the Jugo-Slavs.BALTIC STATES.Lithuania and Poland. Telegraphing from Vilna on 28th and 29th September [Nos. 146 and 147], Mr. Harrison reported that the Lithuanian Government had accepted a Polish proposal for a conference at Suwalki; and at the same time had proposed an armistice, which the Poles had refused. On 2nd October Colonel Ward telegraphing from the same place, further reported [? No. 149] that he had been officiallv informed that the conference had begun on the previous day.[See &quot; Poland,&quot; p. 6].Lithuania and Russia. On 28th September Mr. Tallents transmitted [No. 380] from Riga the following translation of a note handed to the Lithuanian representative at that place by the president of the Russian delegation : On 20th September, at a meeting of the Council of Nations, it was decided to recommend to Poland to observe the neutrality of Lithuania- if Russia also observed it. Russia is ready to undertake to observe the neutrality of Lithuania if there is a full guarantee that Poland will also respect it in full measure. If such an agreement should prove impossible, Russia will then have to secure its safety by occupying such lines and places on Lithuanian territory as should prove necessary in a war against Poland, with the undertaking to clear them immediately the military strategical necessity ceased.The Aland Islands. On 21st September Mr. Eidston reported from Helsingfors [No. 607] the gist of a verbal communication which had been made to\ him, at the request of the President, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to the decision of the selected jurists on the Aland question and its acceptance by the council of the League of Nations.Finland had not been given an opportunity of refuting the arguments of her adversaries which had been presented after her own case, and consequently she regarded the whole procedure as unfair. The unanimous acceptance of the jurists&apos; decision by the council was a bitter disappointment, as the Finnish Government had hoped that at least they would have had the support of the British representative.Should a new commission be appointed for the purpose of finding a solution, as they understood would be the case, they feared- that it too might give a decision without allowing Finland to answer her opponents&apos; arguments. The Foreign Minister was of opinion that such a commission should examine the facts on tbe spot.He said that a rude shock had been given to faith in the League of Nations, which was necessarily identified to some extent with the Entente, and should the islands be attributed to Sweden the Government would be powerless to pursue their pro-Entente policy.BULGARIA.Appeal to the Entente Powers. Telegraphing [No. 130] on 2nd October from Sofia, Sir Herbert Dering sent the following summary of a circular note to the Entente Powers from the Bulgarian Government, dated 1st October : Having received a list of persons to be delivered to the Allies, under Articles 118 to 120 of the Treaty of Peace, the Government point out their loyal observance of all treaty obligations even before these came into force. Thereby they also hoped to win the sympathy of the Allies.Immediately after the signature of the armistice they had instituted commissions for judicial examination, irrespective of rank, of all those guilty of acts contrary to the rules of war. This commission, and also courts-martial dating from war time, have continued to prosecute offenders under the common law, and those accused of the abuse of authority as well as the category of criminals above mentioned.   Five
hundred and thirty-four sentences have already resulted, including several&quot;of death, all of which total have been carried out.They trust that the Allies will approve of this act of justice and reparation, and point out that it would be compromised if its further execution should be entrusted to former adversaries in the Balkans, whose hatred and passions are of longstanding. It would be difficult to expect a guarantee of equity for guilty persons if tried by foreign tribunals of neighbouring Powers.Having so fully demonstrated their good intentions in executing the treaty, the Bulgarian people and the Government confidently appeal for some indulgence as (group undeeypherable) shown to Germanj^. Such moderation would greatly help to mitigate the painful impression made on the Bulgarian people by the treaty stipula-tions. The delivery of the persons claimed would produce a disastrous effect here, at a moment when the Bulgarian people have new trials to face. It is feared that public excitement would be so great that the Government would find it impossible to carry out its duty in the end. It is anticipated that the efforts of the authorities to find and arrest persons implicated would be futile, because numerous citizens would endeavour to impede the search and delivery of Bulgarian subjects to foreign and hostile jurisdiction.In this moment of grave crisis and suffering it would be- hoped to- spare the Bulgarian people further trials.The Bulgarian Government do not base the appeal on principles of justice and international tradition- only, but above all because of the political interest which, though demanding the punishment of the offenders (group undecypherabie), respect legitimate susceptibility for fear of compromising the stability of the work already accomplished, awakening fresh hatred, and creating obstacles to the objects contem-plated by the Treaty of Peace.The Bulgarian Government trust that the Allied Powers will not refuse to exhibit the same indulgence as that to certain Central European Powers, and do not doubt that they wall in (group undecypherabie) equity not only reduce the number of the accused, but leave to the Bulgarian Government the task of continuing the prosecution and punishment of the guilty, which they are firmly decided to carry out with all desired severity and impartiality.THE CAUCASUS.British Prisoners at Baku. Telegraphing from Tifiis on 27th September [No. 412] Commander Luke reported that it had been stated by the Georgian Consul at Baku that Moscow had vetoed a permission for the release of British naval and military prisoners below the rank of officer which he had obtained from the Azerbaijan Soviet.CHINA.Presidential Mandate. Mr. Clive telegraphed [No. 414] on 24th September the following summary of the presidential mandate issued 24th September :  The Foreign Ministry reports that for the past few years Russia has been divided into warring parties, and no Government representative of the united will of the people has been formed, so it is temporardy impossible for China to resume formal relations. The Russian Minister and Consuls have long since lost the qualification to represent their country and to discharge their functions. This has been pointed out verbally to the Russian Minister, and an order should now be issued announcing that the present Russian Minister and Consuls will no longer be treated as such. While the order is issued in accordance with the above report, friendly relations with the Russian people shall continue as before, and the life and property of all peaceable residents will be protected, neutrality shall be maintained towards Russian internal strife and the attitude of the Allies followed. Suitable measures shall be devised by the Ministries and provincial authorities concerned for dealing with all matters pertaining to the Russian concessions, the Chinese Eastern Railway zone and Russian residents.GERMANY.Feeling in Wurternburg. Mr. Gosling telegraphed [No. 34] from Frankfort on 2nd October that, according to reports received, there was a considerable movement in Wurternburg in favour of independence and separation from Prussia.   It was stated that &quot;at least 60 per cent, of the population were sympathetic to this policy. 21-1 B
HUNGARY.New Minister for Foreign Affairs. Air. Athelstan Johnson reported on 25th September [No. 507] that Count Csaky had been appointed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.PERSIA.Resignation of Prince Farman Farma. In a telegram [No. 618] from Teheran, dated 22nd September, Mr. Norman reported that Prince Farman Farina had handed over the government of Ears on 16th September to the&apos;Deputy-Governor and had left Shiraz. This proceeding was equivalent to a permanent resignation. His rapacity and continued extortion of money had gained him intense unpopularity with the populace and matters were likely to come to a head. The Persian Government had recognized this, although they had no immediate intention of dismissing him. In the circumstances, however, it would be nseless to attempt to maintain him as Governor-General, and the Persian Government would now have to seek a suitable successor.The Shah on the Situation. Telegraphing [No. 657] from Teheran on 28th September, Mr. Norman reported a conversation he had had with the Sbah to discuss the situation. The Shah had deplored the delay in completing the elections and in summoning the Medjliss, but pointed out that the threat of invasion, which obliged the evacuation of the capital to be contemplated, had rendered it difficult to pay . serious attention to these questions. He hoped that an advance out of the 2,000,000L loan would enable Persia to tide over the period between the exhaustion of the last monthly subsidy and the acceptance by the Medjliss of the Anglo-Persian Agree-ment. He was sanguine that the agreement would be passed, because suspicion had been dispelled, and it was realized by all sensible people in Persia that the country . could only be saved from anarchy and dissolution by co-operation with Great Britain. This effect had been produced by the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in consenting to submit the agreement to the Medjliss, and in assisting Persia financially in the interim Avithout asking for any immediate return. It could not be doubted by any reasonable person that Great Britain was the disinterested friend of Persia.In reply to Mr. Norman&apos;s telegram, Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 494] acknowledging the satisfactory face value of tbe Shah&apos;s language. At the same time he emphasized the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government would form their judgment by deeds, not words. He insisted that the Medjliss must assemble and take action on the agreement in the course of this month, if the situation was to be saved. Mr. Norman was instructed to impress this fact on the Shah and his Ministers.POLAND.Poland and Lithuania. On 22nd September Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 856] the following substance of a communique issued by the Polish Ministry for Foreign Affairs regarding the breaking off of negotiations with Lithuania at Kalwarya : - In order to end peacefully the conflict between the Polish and Lithuanian armies, resulting from the invasion by Lithuanians of the Polish territory of Suwalki, the-Polish and Lithuanian Governments in agreement sent delegations to Kalwarya. The Polish preliminary conditions for negotiating were : (1) That the Lithuanian Government should respect the demarcation line of 18th July 1919, which is identical with the minimum frontier line in the Suwalki Government, established by the Supreme Council on 8th December 1919 ; and (2) That the Lithuanian Government should bind itself to preserve a strictneutrality in the Polish war with the Soviet Government. The acceptance of these conditions by the Lithuanian Government enabled the Polish delegation to proceed to Kalwarya.   The position taken up there by the Lithuanians was from the beginning in opposition to the obligations previously accepted by their Government.The Lithuanians refused the Polish demand for the withdrawal of the Lithuanian troops from Polish territory to the line of 8th December.   Nevertheless the Polish
delegation, as a proof of goodwill, did not break off negotiations in tbe hope that the-attitude of the Lithuanian delegation might change. After three days of negotiation the Lithuanian delegation declared that the Lithuanian troops&quot; would evacuate Polish territory when the Polish troops withdrew south of the present line to an equivalent distance.The practical results of the Lithuanian proposal, apart from the inadmissible limitation of Polish rights over Polish territory, would have been to hinder the action of the Polish army in the fight against the Bolsheviks, and the delegation cannot attribute any other intention. Moreover, since the Lithuanian delegation likewise -said that it considered the grant of a (word omitted) to Poland as unnecessary, the prolongation of negotiations became useless and the Polish delegation returned to Warsaw after presenting a statement to the effect that the Polish Government,&apos; being compelled to reserve strict freedom of its military action, would still be prepared to reach an understanding with the Lithuanian Government in order to regulate the regrettable conflicts and misunderstandings clue to the action of the Lithuanian army, and would welcome with great satisfaction a change of attitude on the part of the Lithuanian Government.Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 860], Sir Horace said that it had been clear for some time past that the Bolsheviks were determined to regain the initiative and therefore to heavily attack the second and fourth Polish armies in the north. If successful they would be able to conclude a victorious peace, having become masters of the situation. To break the weight of this attack, it would be absolutely necessary to hold the line of the Niemen with the fortress of Grodno. The Poles had no wish to involve Lithuania in their quarrel with Soviet Russia, but military necessity left them no reasonable choice in regard to the passing through a small portion of Lithuanian territory ; it being borne in mind that Poland was fighting for its existence, that she had a relentless enemy, that this enemy could, it was stated, pass freely across Lithuanian territory in virtue of a clause in its treaty with Lithuania, and that the Bolshevik right flank was in fact protected by the actual disposition of the Lithuanian troops.[Sec &quot; Baltic States,&quot; p. 4.]The Prime Minister on the Situation. On 25th September Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 869] the following summary of the more important passages in a speech made by the Prime Minister at the opening session of the Diet on 24th September :  Two months ago Poland&apos;s position was desperate. Only France had really understood the situation, the other western Powers having been deluded into thinking that Polancks policy Avas inspired by imperialist ambitions. Those Powers must have given up Poland for lost, otherwise they would never have advised her to accept terms tantamount to the loss of her independence. However, the imminent prospect of such a loss had created a miracle of unity in the people. Helped by the eminent co-opera-tion of General Weygand, the commanders of the army had put popular enthusiasm to a good use. The Government had felt confidence in the people and had remained at Warsaw.The Polish victory had not only freed Poland from her enemy, but had cleared the political atmosphere of Europe. The attitude of foreign Governments and of public opinion towards Poland had changed. The clanger to which she had been exposed was now better understood and the legend of her weakness dissipated. Even in the hour of uncertainty the United States had never ceased to tend wounded Polish soldiers. The Holy See had given moral support, and the Hungarian people had shown sjnnpathy. England, who steadily inclined towards peace, had convinced herself that, in combating Bolshevism, Poland was defending her own independence and that in defending her independence she was saving the peace of Europe,The Polish Government and people alike sincerely desired peace with Russia. Their attitude had a ready been made, clear, and it depended not on them but on Moscow whether peace would be secured in the near future or not. Unfortunately the removal of Poland&apos;s most pressing danger did not permit either the Government-or the public to relax their efforts, since, in spite of Polancks wishes, the struggle still continued and the forces which had conspired against her were still active: AR attempts to come to a peaceful understanding with Lithuania having failed, the Polish Government had to take the necessary steps to secure for its army freedom of action, against the Bolsheviks, but everything possible had been clone to avoid an armed conflict with Lithuania.
On 3rd October Sir Horace further reported [No. 888] that the Minister for Toreign Affairs had given a party of local journalists the following resume of the present situation :-The peace conditions, presented by the Russian delegates at Riga on 28th September, were in glaring contrast to their previous declaration, but the Polish Government still hoped that the Soviet Government, being desirous of concluding peace, would modify its attitude. The armistice line now proposed by the Bolsheviks was one, not between Poland and Russia, but between Poland on the one side and White Russia and Ukraina on the other, The result of which would be to leave the Russian forces encamped on territories only 70 kilometres east of the Curzon line. As regards the East Galieian question, Poland could only discuss it with her Allies.. There was every hope that peace would be concluded. The Polish claims were moderate and had not changed since the day when the Bolsheviks were at the gates of Warsaw. No difficulty would therefore be made on the side of the Polish Govern-ment, which had not concluded with General Wrangel or anyone else any treaty liable to impede the conclusion of peace with the Soviet Government. A few days ago, the speaker had told the British Minister that the Polish armies had no intention of occupying Vilna, and that Poland desired to come to an amicable understanding with Lithuania provided the latter did not break her neutrality. In that case the situation would be changed for Poland. The Polish Government, however, hoped that the-Polish-Lithuanian negotiations at Suwalki would be successful.RUSSIA.Message to ill. Chicherin regarding the Conditions for the Resumption of Trade.  On 1st October the following message was sent to M. Chicherin through Mr. Leslie at Reval [No. 260] :-In their note of 1st July His Majesty&apos;s Government laid down certain conditions on which they were prepared to resume trade relations between Great Britain and Russia. These conditions were accepted by the Soviet Government in M. Chicheriks telegram of 7th July, and it was on these conditions that Messrs. Kameneif and Krassin were admitted to this country and negotiations were resumed. At their-meeting wdth the Prime Minister on 4th August, they made it clear that they were fully aware of this.By these conditions the Soviet Government undertook, both for itself and on behalf of its delegates  -(a) to refrain from hostile actions and propaganda, direct or indirect, against the institutions of this country ; (6) to refrain from any attempt by military action or by propaganda to encourage the peoples of Asia in any form of action hostile to British interests or theBritish Empire ;(c) to permit all British subjects in Russia to return home immediately, Russian subjects in Great Britain or other parts of the British Empire who desire to return to Russia being&quot; similarly released.These conditions have been and are being flagrantly violated. M. Kameneff engaged, in almost open propaganda and attempted to subsidise a campaign in England against the British Constitution and British institutions, and for these reasons he could not have been permitted to re-enter this country.The message which the Prime Minister handed to M. Kameneff when he left London and in which the question was directly asked of the Soviet Government whether it did or did not intend to desist from propaganda, has received neither acknowledgment nor reply.The recent meeting at Moscow of the Third International, which was presided over by M. Lenin and attended by the members of the Soviet Government, openly proclaimed that the intention of the Communist party, and therefore of the Soviet Government, is to use every means to overthrow existing institutions throughout the world.In its wireless messages to the world the Soviet Government, through its individual members and through its Press, has never ceased to preach hostility to Great Britain and the British Empire. The Soviet Government recently convened a revolutionary conference of Asiatic peoples at Baku avowedly aimed at British interests.   Its actions in the&apos;Caucasus, in Persia, in Central Asia and in Afghanistan,..
openly directed against Great Britain, are well known to the British Government. Above all, in spite of long continued negotiations and of a sincere and steadfast desire on the part of the British Government to carry out the conditions with regard to the mutual repatriation of nationals, British subjects continue to languish in Russian gaols or are refused permission to leave the country.The persistent violation of these conditions can no longer be permitted. The negotiations for a trading agreement with M. Krassin to which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment looked forward as the first step, not merely towards the revival of material - prosperity in eastern Europe, but towards the restoration of peace, have reached a point at which it is necessary to decide definitely whether the conditions under which alone they have been authorised are being, and will continue to be, fulfilled, or whether the negotiations must be abandoned on the very threshold of success.- The. answer to this question rests with the Soviet Government. It is impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to carry the agreement to its final stages so long as the three conditions of their note of 1st July remain unfulfilled. The Soviet Government must carry out its own undertaking to desist from hostile propaganda and action in this country and in the East.Every British subject now detained in Russia, some of them in circumstances of inexcusable hardship and suffering, must be&apos; permitted to return to this country without further delay. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot acquiesce in the continued violation of a solemn undertaking involving grave injury to British subjects.The negotiations for a full exchange of prisoners, whether naval, military, or civilian, between Russia and Great Britain have now been proceeding with little or no intermission since November of last year. His Majesty&apos;s Government have throughout been ready to repatriate all Russians without distinction and without exception. It was M. Litvinoff who insisted on excluding from the exchange persons whom he declined to designate, but who were vaguely described as grave offenders, although the nature of their alleged offence has in no case been proved.Eor a time, under the arrangement concluded between M. Litvinoff and Mr. 0&apos;Grady, the work of repatriation proceeded, and by the end of June of this year 121 British prisoners of war and 727 British civilians had arrived in England, and all the Russian prisoners of war actually in this country as well as in Switzerland (for the area of operation had been extended) had been returned. Since that date a series of obstacles has been placed by the Soviet authorities in the way of complete repatriation. The majority of the members of the British military mission, to the number, it is believed, of 15, who were captured in Siberia as long ago as December and January, stiR remain in confinement in Russian territory. Adeqitate steps to make known to British subjects the fact that they were at liberty to leave Russia were not taken by the Soviet Government. No announcement on the subject was published locally in Russia, in spite of a positive statement by M. Litvinoff that the widest possible publicity had been given to the fact by all local Soviets. When M. Kameneff left London on 11th September there were still in Russia, apart from the Siberian military mission already mentioned, a considerable number of British civilians, enquiries regarding 81 of whom had been received by me, and a list of whom was handed to M. Kameneff.   I have since received further enquiries.A third and even more painful case is that of the British subjects, about 72 in number, who were seized and thrown into prison by the Soviet authorities at Baku, when the Bolshevik revolution took place in that town. They included the British consular representative at Baku. Our repeated&quot; endeavours to communicate with Baku direct proved fruitless. M. Litvinoff then offered to transmit a message to the Azerbaijan Government and to use the good offices of the Soviet Government of Moscow to obtain the release of these unfortunate and innocent persons, who were reported to us as receiving treatment of the most cruel description. A message was in fact sent, but the only response has been a proposal to exchange the British subjects for a number of Turks at Malta, who had been convicted of attempting to overthrow the Government of Turkey or of having committed, atrocities against the non-Moslem population of that country. We have ample evidence to show thatthe Baku revolution was brought about in consultation with your Government and mainly through the instrumentality of your troops. The continuance of your responsibility is demonstrated by a telegraphic message received as recently as 28th September from the Georgian Consul at Baku to the effect that, though he had obtained permission from the Azerbaijan Soviet a fortnight earlier for the release of the British naval and military prisoners below the rank of officer, this order had been vetoed at &apos; Moscow.21-1 . C
openly directed against Great Britain, are well -known to the British Government. Above all, in spite of long continued negotiations and of a sincere and steadfast desire on the part of the British Government to carry7 out the conditions with regard to the mutual repatriation of nationals, British subjects continue to languish in Russian gaols or are refused permission to leave the country.The persistent violation of these conditions can no longer be permitted. The negotiations for a trading agreement with M. Krassin to which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-meut looked forward as the first step, not merely towards the revival of material prosperity in eastern Europe, but towards the restoration of peace, have reached a point at which it is necessary to decide definitely whether the conditions under which alone they have been authorised are being, and will continue to be, fulfilled, or whether the negotiations must be abandoned on the very threshold of success.- The answer to this question rests with the Soviet Government. It is impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to carry the agreement to its final stages so long as the three conditions of their note of 1st July remain unfulfilled. The Soviet Government must carry out its own undertaking to desist from hostile propaganda and action in this country and in the East.Every British subject now detained in Russia, some of them in circumstances of inexcusable hardship and suffering, must be permitted to return to this country without further delay. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot acquiesce in the continued violation of a solemn undertaking involving grave injury to British subjects.The negotiations for a full exchange of prisoners, whether naval, military, or civilian, between Russia and Great Britain have now been proceeding with little or no intermission since November of last year. His Majesty&apos;s Government have throughout been ready to repatriate all Russians without distinction and without excexotion. It was M. Litvinoff who insisted on excluding from the exchange persons whom he declined to designate, but who were vaguely described as grave offenders, although the nature of their alleged offence has in no case been proved.For a time, under the arrangement concluded between M. Litvinoff and Mr. 0&apos;Grady, the work of repatriation proceeded, and by the end of June of this year 124 British prisoners of war and 727 British civilians had arrived in England, and all the Russian prisoners of war actually in this country as well as in Switzerland (for the area of operation had been extended) had been returned. Since that date a series of obstacles has been placed by the Soviet authorities in the way of complete repatriation. The majority of the members of the British military mission, to the number, it is believed, of 15, who were captured in Siberia as long ago as December and January, still remain in confinement in Russian territory. Adequate steps to make known to British subjects the fact that they were at liberty to leave Russia were not taken by the Soviet Government. No announcement on the subject was published locally in Russia, in spite of a positive statement by M. Litvinoff that the widest possible publicity had been given to the fact by all local Soviets. When M. Kameneff left London on 11th September there were still in Russia, apart from the Siberian military mission already mentioned, a considerable number of British civilians, enquiries regarding 81 of whom had been received by me, and a list of whom was handed to M. Kameneff.   I have since received further enquiries.A third and even more painful case is that of the British subjects, about 72 in number, who were seized and thrown into prison by the Soviet authorities at Baku, when the Bolshevik revolution took place in that town. They included the British constdar representative at Baku. Our repeated&quot; endeavours to communicate with Baku direct proved fruitless. M. Litvinoff then offered to transmit a message to the Azerbaijan Government and to use the good offices of the Soviet Government of Moscow to obtain the release of these unfortunate and innocent persons, who were reported to tis as receiving treatment of the most cruel description. A message was in fact sent, but the only- response has been a proposal to exchange the British subjects for a number of Turks at Malta, who had been convicted of attempting to overthrow the Government of Turkey or of having committed, atrocities against the non-Moslem population of that country. We have ample evidence to show that the Baku revolution was brought about in consultation with y7our Government and mainly through the instrumentality of your troops. The continuance of your responsibility is demonstrated by a telegraphic message received as recently as 28th September from the Georgian Consul at Baku to the effect that, though he had obtained permission from the Azerbaijan Soviet a fortnight earlier for the release of the British naval and military7 prisoners below the rank of officer, this order had been vetoed at Moscow.21-1 . C
Meanwhile there remain in British hands in different parts of the British Empire^ the great hulk having already been repatriated a very limited number of Russian subjects of whom, whether they have or have not been guiltv of offences against the law of the country, we desire to be rid. In this country there remain M. Babushkin and his companions, five in number, who have been detained here on their repatriation from India, solely as a means of inducing the Soviet Government to proceed to the fulfilment of their undertaking.His Majesty&apos;s Government have gone further than negotiate about individual groups or cases. On 6th September 1 telegraphed a proposal that we should agree upon a common date and places for the simultaneous delivery of all our respective nationals, wherever they might be detained. I have received no reply to this, message.This condition of affairs cannot&apos;be permitted to continue. . The negotiations for the mutual release of prisoners cannot any longer be suspended or retarded by-artificial and heartless delays. Still more is it impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to append their signature to a trade agreement with a Government that thus treats not only its own undertakings but the subjects of a country with which its representatives are at the time engaged in friendly negotiations.We have given an undertaking, to which we have scrupulously adhered, that we shall not assist in any hostile action against the Soviet Government, but unless by 10th October we have definite evidence that the conditions laid down as to the release of British prisoners are being complied with, we shah take whatever action we consider necessary to secure their release.To this, on 3rd October M. Chicherin replied that instructions re the prisoners were being sent to M. Krassin. The whole affair of the exchange of prisoners had, he said, been entrusted to M. Litvinoff, and he must terminate this affair, settling dates, places, technicalities. He would duly receive instructions concerning the act of exchange. As to the other questions referred to in Lord Curzon&apos;s wireless^ M. Krassin would receive instructions ; likewise concerning the Russian submarines and Mr. Davidson&apos;s case..   The following wireless messages to the agents of the Soviet Government sent on 3rd and 4th October have been intercepted :  (1) To M. Litvinoff :-As Earl Curzon&apos;s radio renders urgent the completion of the exchange of prisoners we are sending a special delegate to,Baku to speed up negotiations with the Azerbaijan Government. We are reminding the British Government that you have to complete the exchange.   Please wait for our detailed instructions re prisoners.(2) To M. Krassin :-(a) Earl Curzon&apos;s wireless of 2nd October refers to all questions interesting both governments......Full instructions concerning all questions will be sent to you.Litvinoff at Christiania was to complete the arrangements for prisoners exchange. Instructions for an agreement on this point as well as others sent to you, likewise the case of the submarines and DaVidson&apos;s case.(b) If in my cyphered wireless containing instructions for an answer to Earl Curzon&apos;s radio of 2nd October you find something not sufficiently dear, please send me immediately a. message for elucidation. In Earl Curzon&apos;s radio it is alleged that we (? have) vetoed the release of British prisoners in Baku. Please categorically assure the British Government that it has been misinformed and misled. Our Government has never vetoed the release of British prisoners in Baku. This allegation is untrue. We are negotiating now with the Azerbaijan Government regarding our proposals communicated to you in my cyphered message as to collective negotiations. As to British prisoners residing in Russia, we put no obstables to the exchange. Explana-tions concerning submarines and Davidson follow at the earliest possible (moment).Soviet Submarines. -On 26th September Lord Curzon sent [No. 256] the following, message to Mr. Leslie at Reval for transmission to M. Chicherin : His Majesty&apos;s Government bave learnt that a submarine A.G. 23 was launched at Nicolaiev early in June and is being completed. In view of the repeated declara-tions pubhely made by leading members of the Soviet Government that it considers itself in a state of war with this country, and in view of the impossibility in these circumstances of waiting to ascertain whether the intentions of a submarine controlled by the Soviet Government are actively hostile or not, there has been no alternative-
but to issue orders to His Majesty&apos;s ships in the Black Sea that this vessel is to bo attacked should she be encountered on the high seas. It is open to the Soviet Government to give orders&apos; which will render the execution of these instructions unnecessary.[For reply, see above.]On 2nd October Lord Curzon sent j No. 266] a further message on the subject of -submarines to Mr. Leslie for transmission to M. Ohicheriri :--His Majesty&apos;s Government have heard rumours to the effect that submarines of the Bolshevik fleet have put to sea in the Baltic.. The standpoint adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government as regards submarine activity in the Black Sea has alreadv been set out in their telegram of 26th September; and the views therein expressed must be held to apply equally to the Baltic:Should such submarines therefore be seen in the Baltic the orders given hold good ; they will be attacked at sight if encountered on the high seas.As already stated by His Majesty&apos;s Government it is open to the Soviet Government to give orders which would prevent such circumstances from arising.[For reply, see above.]SERBIA.Colonies for Russian Refugees [F.C.R., xxvi, p. 12]. Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 209] on 24th September to Sir Alban Young asking him to express the gratifica-tion of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the manner in which their tentative proposals had been received by the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government, and to state that in their opinion a satisfactory agreement could be arrived at on the following basis :  (1) His Majesty&apos;s Government will transfer to Serbia the 3,500 refugees now in Lenmos, as soon as the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government is prepared to receive them. As they are at present living in a tented camp, it is important that they should be moved by the middle of October ; imme-diately afterwards the 1,300 refugees in Cyprus will similarly be transferred, and then those in Egypt.(2) In order to satisfy the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons, we should be in a position to show that any sum allotted for the maintenance of Russian refugees in Serbia is based on a careful review of the experience already obtained by the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government in the past, and also that a British representative on the spot will take part in the administration of the funds. Please ask the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government accordingly to show and communicate to you any data necessary for this purpose..(3) His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot pledge themselves to provide for the refugees indefinitely. They are. ready to do so for six months, after which the whole situation could be reviewed in consultation with the Serb-Groat-Slovene Government.(4) His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to pay the expenses in whatever form (presumably dinars) is most convenient to the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government.(5) In asking that a British representative   be admitted to the Russo-Serb committee, you should make it clear that we do not desire to interfere actively in the work of that committee, the more so as we have received very favourable accounts of it. I should be glad if you would discuss the matter personally with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and arrive at an immediate settlement on the above lines.It may help you to know that we should not be averse to some advantage accruing to the Serbs on the basis that the per head cost of our refugees should be slightly in excess of those already in Serbia, especially if the Serbs are prepared to agree that at the end of six months our liability will be definitely liquidated.TURKEY.Collective Note.-On 4th October Admiral de Robeck sent the following telegram [No. 1076] :-The collective note of the High Commissioners, dated 29th September, and handed to the Grand Vizier on 1st October reminds the Porte that sales of
Government stocks, which continue to he advertised daily, are irregular from the-point of view ofthe Allies, and should he prohibited, but states that having regard to the stringent financial necessities of the Government,&apos; and the Grand Vizier&apos;s expression of readiness to submit to immediate control pending the institution of the Financial Commission, the High Commissioners are disposed to adopt the following decisions :-The Turkish Government would be atithorized to effect the sale on the best terms obtainable for materials which they own, and the fate of which at the present time can be contemplated without infringing the articles in the peace treaty relative to war material.The controkof revenue and expenditure of the State, and consequently that of the sale of materials in question, and of the employment of sums realized: thereby, would be exercised by three delegates of France, Great Britain, and Italy at the Public Debt, and by means at the disposal &quot;of the Debt^This control would begin to operate immediately, -i.e., on 1st October. The first task of the delegates would be to consider evidence of the sales of material which could be authorized without infringing the articles mentioned above. The Note concludes by expressing confidence that the Porte will agree to the proposal, and asks that urgent instructions,be given to the proper authorities.
