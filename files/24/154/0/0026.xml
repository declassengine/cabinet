FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Internal Affairs. Telegraphing [No. 210] on 9th September, the Viceroy reported that Mahmnd Tarsi, the chief Afghan delegate to the Mussoorie Conference,. was stated to be sick. In some quarters this was construed into his being out of favour with the Amir. From Kandahar, it was reported that considerable unrest had been occasioned by the severe punishment inflicted on 1,60 Sepoys arrested for looting-shops, three of them having died as the result of flogging.On 16th September the Viceroy telegraphed [No. 211] that certain Kabul mullahs, instigated by Tarsi, had warned the Amir against Nadir Khan, who, in consequence, had been rebuked and instructed to moderate his anti-British attitude.The Herat Border [F.C.R., xxii, p. 2]. Information has been received to the effect that the Jamshidis who had- been deported from Badghis, north of the Herat border, were being despatched in batches to Kabul.ALBANIA.Italian Attitude. On 7th September Mr. Kennard reported [telegram unnumbered] that he had handed a note to Count Manzoni in accordance with the. instructions he had received from the Foreign Office, and that Count Manzoni had promised a written reply as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not then considered what the attitude of the Italian Government should be in the event of other Powers insisting on an international commission. They wore of opinion that such a commission would only tend to complicate matters, and that the proper solution lay in the withdrawal of the Serbs from Albanian territory within the 1913 frontier and in the declaration by the Powers already suggested by them.Three days later he reported [telegram also unnumbered] the receipt of the Italian reply. It stated, that the Italian Government considered-the proposal of the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government unacceptable as being likely to prolong the present dangerous state of affairs in Albania and to complicate the situation. They proposed instead that the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government should be informed that the Powers considered that the frontiers assigned to Albania in 1913 should be respected by all pending- a different decision by the Peace Conference, and that an analogous communication should be made to the Tirana Government. This being done, the Italian Government would be disposed to adhere to the appointment of an international commission composed of representatives of the Allied and Associated Powers (with the right to associate with themselves&apos; one Serbian and one Albanian representative in a consultative capacity) and charged solely with the duties of ascertaining how conflicts have occurred locally, and of reporting to the Council of Ambassadors how their recurrence can be best avoided.On 18th September Mr. Kennard was instructed [No. 439] to reply to the Italian note in the following sense : Lord Curzon appreciated the fact, that the Italian Government were not in principle opposed to a commission, and was ready to accept the reservations made in their note with the exception of that which merely restated the proposal made on 28th August by the Italian Ambassador to the effect that the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government should at once be ordered by the Powers to withdraw their troops beyond the 1913 frontiers.To this proposal, as he had already stated, His Majesty s Government were not prepared to adhere. They had received from the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government an explicit assurance that they would recognize the 1913 frontiers so soon as these had been reaffirmed by the Conference. To ask them at this moment to retire from a line which, they asserted, was accorded to them hy General Franchet d&apos;Esperey would merely expose the Allied Powers to a profitless discussion as to the basis upon which other territory in the Adriatic was in Allied occupation.   Moreover, the Albanian
ACSTRfA.The Plebiscite Area. 011,12th September Mr. Bridgeman telegraphed from Vienna [No. 363] as follows : M. Oppenheimer, chief of a section of- the State Department, came to see me this morning on behalf of Dr. -Renner, absent in the country, to request that a small detachment of Allied troops should be sent immediately to the Klagenfurt Basin in order to guard the freedom of the vote which the Austrians allege is compromised by the unscrupulous proceedings of the Jugo-Slavs. The Austrian Minister in Paris had been instructed to communicate a similar request to the Council of Ambassadors, and the Austrian Minister in London would be directed to take the matter up with the Foreign Office. The Austrian Government specially desired that British troops should be sent, as French would be regarded, as favouring the Jugo-Slavs and Italian as favouring Austria. I promised to convey the request to your Lordship, but said that I did not expect that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be able to send even a small body of troops to Klagenfurt.I went on to say that, supposin^&apos; no lied troops could be sent, it would be necessary to consider other means of securing the freedom of the vote. Austria com-plained that the Jugo-Slavs were bribing and intimidating the population in the plebiscite area. The Jugo-Slavs complained that Austrian propaganda was managed by Pan-Germans assisted by German (? money), and were likewise suspicious of the presence of some 4,000 Italian troops at Yillach, close to the western boundary of the plebiscite, area.In view of the withdrawal of Jugo-Slav troops from Zone A, the Jugo-Slavs considered that the presence of these Italian troops could only influence the vote in a manner unfavourable to themselves.; It appeared even as if the Italian troops were remaining at Villach, if not at the request, at any rate with the consent of thequestion could not in tins way be isolated from that of the Adriatic, since it was intimately bound up with the Treaty of London, which gave the Jugo-Slavs a greater extent of Albanian territory than they then occupied. A request to the Serb-Croat--Slovene Government to withdraw from this line of demarcation would be likely to be met by the statement that the Italian forces were themselves in qccuoation of the whole territory accorded to them by the Treaty of London.While fully agreeing, therefore, that the present situation in Albania could be provisional only, and was extremely unsatisfactory, Lord Curzon thought that it rested with the Italian Government, by expediting the resumption and the settlement of the Pallanza negotiations, to enable the Conference to decide upon the frontiers of Albania and thus automatically to secure its evacuation by the Jugo-Slavs. At present he was unable to throw the responsibility for the delay which was occurring, or for the Albanian situation which was a corollary of that delay, upon the Jugo-Slavs, who had for long been anxious to secure a resumption of the Pallanza negotiations and a settlement of the whole question.Serbian Attitude. On 10th September Lord Curzon informed [No. 190] Sir Alban Young that in a note dated 26th August the Serb-Croat-Slovene representative in London had written : The Royal Government have always made it clear that it would submit to the decisions of the Peace Conference on the Albanian question, and would withdraw its troops from the line of demarcation as soon as a request to&apos;that effect, based on the decision taken, was addressed to it by the Conference.Telegraphing from Belgrade on 11th September [No. 266] Sir Alban Young said that when spoken to in regard to the renewal of official assurances that the integrity of Albania would be respected by the Serbian Government, the President of^ the Council had reminded him of the reservation he had already made [F.O.R., xxv, p. 3]. The Serbian Government would respect the Albania whose frontiers had been defined in 1913 ; and as those frontiers were incomplete they would recognize the decision of the Supreme Council in regard to the rest of the delimitation. He added that Albania was only one part of the Adriatic question, and he did not think it right that this bit should be singled out for special treatment.Regarding the Italian demand that the Serbs should withdraw to the 1913 line, Sir Alban Young telegraphed on 13th September [No. 267] that he did not for a moment believe that the Serbs would do so until that withdrawal formed part of the final solution of the whole question of the Adriatic.
Austrian Government. When M. Oppenheimer said that the presence of Italian troops on Austrian territory cost Austria a lot of-money7, I enquired whether Austria had asked the Italian Government to withdraw them. He did not give a verv clear answer, hut I gathered that no such request had yet been made to the Italian Government. I suggested to him, explaining that 1 spoke without instruction from your Lordship, that if it was not possible to meet the Austrian request for the despatch of British troops to the plebiscite area, the same result might be obtained by the withdrawal of the Italian troops from Villach, as it was certain that their presence in that region furnished the Jugo-Slavs with a pretext for declaring that the vote would not be impartial.On 17th September Colonel Peck reported [No. 21] from Klagenfurt:  The conditions at present prevailing in the plebiscite area approximate to the best possible under the conditions laid down in the treaty7, but are not satisfactorv.. In my opinion it is impossible to hold a free and fair plebiscite in an area which is under the administration of one of the two interested sides without the presence of unbiassed troops of another nation. Since the Italian troops are impossible, for political reasons and British are not available, the presence of French troops alone would help to keep in check the gendarmerie recruited on the spot.I think it most advisable that the Italian troops should be removed from Villach immediately, as their presence is a constant source of irritation, suspicion and fear to the Serb-Croat-Slovene authorities, and further provides an excuse on which they delay to take any action on many of the instructions of the Commission.This telegram from Colonel Peck was communicated to Mr. Bridgeman, who, on 18th September, sent the following telegram [No. 369] in reference to it: I informed Mr. Oppenheimer that Colonel Peck had succeeded in securing the withdrawal of the Jugo-Slav troops on 17th September. I further informed him that &quot;your Lordship could hold out no hope of British troops being sent to the plebiscite area, and that in view of this and of the fact that the use of Italian troops was impossible for political reasons, Colonel Peck thought that French troops were the only remaining alternative. Mr. Oppenheimer was disappointed to learn that there was no prospect of British troops being sent to Klagenfurt, and observed that Austria would prefer no troops at all to French, as he feared they7 would favour the Jugo-Slavs. I said in that case the Austrian proposal for the despatch of an Allied contingent to the plebiscite area would probably fall through, and it would be necessary to consider some other means for securing a free vote.Colonel Peck ^thought it most desirable that Italian troops should be removed from Villach immediately, as their presence was a source of irritation and suspicion to the Jugo-Slav authorities and provided an excuse for them to delay7 execution of the instructions of the Commission. As Mr. Oppemheinier had told me that the Austrian Government had every confidence in Colonel Peck&apos;s impartiality7, and greatly appre-ciatecl the skill with which he had hitherto conducted the business of the Commission, Austria might well be advised to act so far as possible on his recommendation by doing what they could to secure the withdrawal of the Italian troops. So far Colonel Peck had succeeded in obtaining the withdrawal of the Jugo-Slav troops, but the difficult question of the Jugo-Slav gendarmerie employed in the plebiscite area remained to be settled, and his hand would rapidly be strengthened if the Italian troops were withdrawn from Villach. I was careful to explain that this was only my oyra appreciation of the situation and that I had not received any7 instructions from your Lordship to make definite proposals.Mr. Oppenheimer said he would convey to Dr. Renner the information which I had given him, but he doubted whether it was desirable from the Austrian point of view that the Italian troops should be withdrawn from Villach. They had been sent there at a time when the region was threatened with invasion by7 the Jugo-Slavs, and when not only Austria but Italy was interested in preventing them occupying this region. Austria had no troops suitable to replace the Italian troops, so that if the latter were removed he feared that the Jugo-Slavs might again be tempted to invade the district.I replied that I had no information showing that the Jugo-Slavs harboured any such design, and the fact that they7 had withdrawn from the plebiscite area did not look as if they contemplated invasion of Austria.The Italian Charge d&apos;Affaires came to see me later in the morning to say that he understood Mr. Oppenheimer had made proposals to me on 12th September that an inter-Allied contingent should be sent to the plebiscite area. He asked my views on the question.   I informed him of the substance of my two conversations with
Mr. Oppenheimer, adding that, as the proposal to send an Allied contingent to the plebiscite area did not seem likely to be realized, it would probably be necessary to think of some other alternative, and that Colonel Peck recommended that the Italian troops should be removed from Villach. I gave the Italian Charge d&apos;Affaires Colonel Peck&apos;s reasons as stated in his telegram No. 21.The Italian Charge d&apos;Affaires said that the Italians were not anxious to remain longer than was necessary at Villach, but believed their presence there exercised a restraining influence on the Jugo-Slavs. If they were to withdraw, the Jugo-Slavs might adopt still more terrorist measures in the plebiscite area. I said I had not gathered this impression from Colonel Peck&apos;s reports, and it was clear from the memorandum communicated by Mr. Oppenheimer that the Jugo-Slavs were doing much that they ought not to do, notwithstanding the presence of Italians at Villach. Colonel Peck had urged the Jugo-Slavs to reorganize their gendarmerie, and it seemed that if they had not got the excuse of the presence of Italian troops it would be more difficult for them to evade fulfilling the instructions of the plebiscite area Commission as to recruiting the police force locally. The Italian Charge d&apos;Affaires said that this might be so, but in his opinion the best solution of the question would be the despatch of an inter-Allied contingent to the plebiscite area.River Frontiers-Ow 16th September Mr. Bridgeman reported [No. 366] that he had received a note from the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the following effect: The Austrian delegate on the International Commission for the Delimitation of the Austro-Jugo-SIav Frontier has enquired of the Conference of Ambassadors whether the powers conferred on it by the Conference on 22nd July 1920 authorize it to modify the river frontiers. The Austrian Government understand that the Ambassadors&apos; Conference will settle this question at one of its next sittings, and urges His Majesty&apos;s Government to suggest to the Conference of Ambassadors through the British representative that the Boundary Commission, in view of the close economic relations existing between the inhabitants of both banks of the River Mur, should be empowered to extend its functions between Spielfeld and Radkersburg, over a strip of territory about seven miles broad south of that river.The Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs wiR furnish a detailed statement on the economic situation in the Mur vallej^ in a few days, but has put forward the foregoing request in view of the believed imminent decision by the Ambassadors&apos; Conference.If, as has been suggested, the River Mur is laid down as the frontier, the fertile region to the south of the river, known as the Abstall basin, of which the natural outlet is towards the north, will be cut off from the body to which it naturally belongs from the geographical, cultural and economic points of view, and will be incorporated with Jugo-Slavia, into which it cannot debouch southwards owing to the mountain barrier of the Windisch Buchel.Dr. Renner on Union with Germany. On 15th September Mr. Bridgeman telegraphed [No. 361] that Dr. Renner, answering Pan-German critics at a political meeting at Innsbruck, had explained his attitude on the question of union with Germany. He claimed to have supported it from the first and throughout the peace negotiations, and threw the responsibility for its failure on the Christian Socialists. He was still for union as against a Danube Confederation, but his first duty was to see that Austria was fed. If he had visited Berlin he would have prejudiced Austria&apos;s chances of obtaining food through the Western Powers. He hinted that, his ideas had not been ill received in Rome, and declared that Austria would propose the removal of the veto on union at the League of Nations meeting in November. He spoke bitterly of the leading role played by French imperialism, observing that, so long as France with her imperialism played the first violin in politics, Austrians would certainly not be able to achieve very much.BALTIC STATES.Peace Treaties with Russia [F.C.R., xxv., p. 4]. On 13th September, Mr. Tallents reported from Riga [No. 337] that the Central Executive Committee at Moscow had ratified the Russian peace treaties with the Letts and the Lithuanians on 9th September. The treaties, however, did not take effect until after the final exchange of ratifications. 20-4 B
Lithuania and Poland. On IOth September Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed from Warsaw [No. 826] the substance of a telegram sent by Prince Sapieha to the Lithuanian Minister for Foreign Affairs on Oth September : -The Lithuanian Government has violated, and continues to violate its neutrality The passage of  Bolshevik troops across Lithuanian territory is confirmed:   the &apos; Lithuanian army has occupied Polish territory ; the Red army has passed freely from East Prussia to a new concentration area, only a small minority of refugees from tfie Bolshevik army having been disarmed and interned;  and direct joint action of the Lithuanian army with the Red army has been recently confirmed.The Polish Government is thus placed at a disadvantage and is compelled to fight-its enemy, without consideration of territory, where the latter is to be found.However, the Polish Government willingly accepts the proposal of the Lithuanian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the following conditions : -(1) The object of the negotiations will not be the establishment of a new demar-cation line, as the boundary of the former Suwalki Government was established by the Supreme Council on 8th September 1919, and this decision still constitutes the sole foundation of a just demarcation line between Poland and Lithuania,(2) Lithuania wih undertake to observe absolute neutrality in the war between Poland and the Soviet Government, It is understood that the Polish Government will regard it as a violation of that neutrality should the Red army take advantage of Lithuanian territory for the passage of its troops or use that territory as a base of operations.The Polish Government prefers Kalvaria as the place for negotiations.The Polish Government renews its protest against the violation of Polish territory, which is the more regrettable as it paralyzes the efforts of the Polish Government to make feelings of loyalty and friendship between the two nations the basis of Polish-Lithuanian relations.Telegraphing from Kovno on 11th September [No. 133], Colonel Ward reported that, at the request of the Lithuanian Government, the French Commissioner was that day telegraphing to the Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Lithuanian Government would send delegates to Kalvaria, and that hostilities would cease on 13th September in so far as the Lithuanians were concerned.On 18th September Colonel Ward telegraphed [No. 140] saying that the Polish delegation at Kalvaria had presented an ultimatum to the Lithuanians to the effect that their troops must retire to the line of 8th December and had given until 2 pun. en 18th September as the time limit for the answer. Failing this, hostilities would be renewed after 12 hours,A reply was sent by the Lithuanian Government before the expiration of the given time, stating that their troops would be withdrawn, but stipulating that the intervening country should be considered a temporarily neutral zone-Colonel Ward added that the decision to withdraw appeared to him wise and the stipulation regarding the neutral zone reasonable.Telegraphing again [No. 141] on the following day he said that the Polish delegates had refused to accept the Lithuanian proposal and had left Kalvaria on the evening of 18th September for Warsaw. They said that their troops would be peaceable until 6 a.m. on the following morning ; but if the Lithuanians had not then retired they reserved to themselves the right to take anj7 action, necessary. Orders had been sent to the Lithuanian command to refrain from ah provocation, but to be prepared against attack.THE CAE CAS OS.British Prisoners at Baku [F.C.R., xxxv, p. 6]. The following telegram [No, 399] was sent from Tiflis by Commander Luke on 17th September: Huseinov has sent me a copy of the telegram from him ;,to Chicherin for Litvinoff instructing the latter to reassure His Majesty&apos;s Government that the Azerbaijan Soviet will agree to the release of the British prisoners at Baku in exchange for the Turkish Nationalist prisoners arrested in Constantinople.After Huseinovs arrival here, I endeavoured to arrange a meeting with him in order that we should have better conditions *for the prisoners pending release.
He first sent a verbal message through Alshioma, which according to the latter was-intended to be offensive, to the effect that if I wanted to see him I could go to his office. I stipulated that I could only see him on neutral ground, namely, the Georgian Foreign Office. The meeting finally took place there by appointment this afternoon, after Huseinov had kept me waiting for an hour. I endeavoured to secure, firstly, permission for prisoners to send and receive mails; secondly, an hour&apos;s exercise in their yard ; thirdly, the immediate release of Hewelcke on the ground of ill-health ; fourthly, permission for Gray and his family and any English ladies to leave Azerbaijan. Huseinov agreed to the first, subject to censorship by the Baku Foreign Office (sic); agreed in principle to the second; refused the third, but said he would allow-Plewelcke to live as in his own house; and said he would consider the fourth on his return to Baku.I venture to utter a warning against the belief apparently entertained by the: English Press, to the effect that since their transfer from Bailov prison our prisoners enjoy comparative liberty.   According to information from the Georgian Mission at Baku, such is, I am told, not the case, their confinement continuing to be extremely rigorous.French Offer to Assyrians. On 7th September Commander Luke reported [No. 391] that he had been informed that three (Assyrians?) had arrived from Syria with a letter from General Gouraud offering to enlist 1,000 men and to transport them and a considerable number of families to the French zone in the neighbourhood of Lrfa. The Assyrians, while most anxious to leave the Caucasus quickly, did not wish to be split up in different parts of Mesopotamia, but desired to form a solid block, if possible, under British protection. They therefore asked advice as to the acceptance or otherwise of the French offer.CHINA.General Chen-Chiung-Min and the Government of Canton. On 18th September Mr. Clive telegraphed [No. 396] that, a serious attempt was being made by General Chen-Chiung-Min, acting with the approval of the Yunan authorities, to oust the present Military Government of Canton with whom the Northern Government v ere in negotiation for settling the differences between the North and the South. General Chen-Chiung-Min took Swatow three weeks ago and was now advancing on Canton. His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General reported that the Canton-Kowloon railway had been cut seriously at mile 26, presumably by pirates co-operating with Chen-Chiung-Min. The nervous feeling in Canton indicated that the Military Governor aud other officials were preparing to leave.The Consul-General had been in close touch with the Commodore at Hongkong, and all reasonable precautions had been taken for the protection of the foreign settlement.Relations with His Majesty &apos;s Government [F.C.R., xxv, p. 7]. On 13th September Lord Curzon instructed [No. 288] Mr. Clive to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, when they returned from their holidays, he would gladly communicate his message to the other members of the Cabinet. For his own part the receipt of so friendly a message gave him great pleasure, and he heartily reciprocated tbe desire of tbe Minister for Foreign Affairs that the most cordial relations might be maintained between their two countries.Position of the Russian Minister in Pekin. Mr. Clive telegraphed on 10th September [No. 391], reporting that the Russian Minister had informed him of the receipt of a warning from the Chinese Government that the Russian Legation and Consulate would shortly cease to be recognized. The Russian Minister represented no sort of Government and his authority was no longer recognized by many Russian officials. The Chinese Government could therefore no longer allow cypher telegrams to pass between him and Russian officials in China.CZECHO-SLO slovakia.New Cabinet. On 15th September Sir George Clerk telegraphed [No. 147], saying that on the previous day, at a meeting of the Czech Social Democrats, the Ministers of the latter party had been relieved, at their own request, from further participation in the Government.   It had also been resolved to put off  till 25th
December the party meeting previously fixed for 28tfi September. The Moderate wing no doubt hoped thereby to gain time in which to reorganize the campaign against the Extremists.&apos; Nothing definite was yet known as to the composition of the new Government,, which in the view of the leading newspapers would be bourgeois in character and would consist largely of non-party experts.Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 148] he further reported that the President of the Republic had accepted the resignation of the Government, and that a new Cabinet had been formed under the leadership of M. Cerny, who till recently had been political administrator in Moravia and belonged to no political party.The Ministers of Finance, Foreign Affairs, and [one other] remained unchanged and the remaining Ministers were leading departmental officials of no political stamp.The Cabinet was only intended to carry on the administration until the Social Democrats had settled their differences.According to The Times of 18th September an official telegram from Prague-received in London states that the new Ministry is composed as follows : M. Cerny - - Prime Minister and Minister for the Interior.Dr. Behes - - Foreign Affairs.Dr. English - - Finance.Dr. Susta - - Education.Dr. Popelka - - Justice.General Husak - - National Defence.Dr. Fatka - - Posts.Dr. Brdlik       . - - Agriculture.Dr. Gruber - - Social Welfare.Dr. Fajnor - - Unification.M. Prusa - - Supplies.Dr. Prochazka - - Public Hygiene.Dr. Hotovec - - Commerce.Dr. Burger - - Railways.M. Micura - - Slovakia.&quot;. FRANCE,The Proposal to abandon the Geneva Conference. On 18th September the following telegram was sent to Lord Derby by Lord Curzon : . Your Excellency is aware of the surprise with which His Majesty&apos;s Government have received the communication in which the French Government urge that the Geneva Conference should be abandoned, and that the Reparation Commission should instead summon the German delegation to Paris to discuss the German proposals with them.The arguments put forward by the French Government in favour of this proposal, which involves the reversal of the policy agreed upon at Spa, are as follows :-(1) That the delay which has occurred since Spa has raised the presumption thatthe project of a conference at Geneva has lapsed. (2) That the &quot;present disposition&quot; of the German Government to evade theirtreaty obligations renders impolitic a meeting &quot; to settle craestions arisingout of the treaty.&quot;(3) That the United States and Belgian Governments are opposed to the Geneva meeting.None of these contentions are sound. The answers to them are seriatim as follows : (1) This argument can hardly be taken seriously. Negotiations as to the Geneva Conference have been in continuous progress between the Allied Govern-ments since 27th July.(2) His Majesty&apos;s Government clo not know what instances the French Govern-ment have in mind of any tendency on the part of the German Government to seek opportunities to escape from the burdens imposed upon them by
the treaty. - Such facts as the passage of the disarmament law of 7th August and the law of 21st August providing for the abolition of military service, the steady.reduction of the German army and the delivery (despite the disturbances in Silesia) of more than the stipulated quantity of coal for August may be cited as evidence to the contrary. These facts are, of course, not conclusive, but they make it impossible to base, on the ground alleged by the French Government, the withdrawal of a concession to which the German Government and the German people are entitled to lock forward. In any case, it is a complete misrepresentation of the policy agreed at Spa to suggest that the Geneva meeting is intended to &quot; settle questions arising out of the treaty.&quot; The decision taken at Spa on 16th July was that the question of reparations was, in the first instance, to be considered by a special commission composed of two delegates from each delegation, who should meet at Geneva to explore the whole position and report to the Allied Governments. On 12th July the Prime Minister had already made it clear that what was required from this Commission was not a decision but a report, and M. Millerand had accepted the proposal on this understanding. (3) The Belgian Government have now approached us in the same sense as the French Government. We are in communication with them on the subject, and have good hopes of modifying their views. As regards the United States Government, it now appears that the interpretation given by the French Government to the statement recently made by the United States delegate on the Reparation Commission is based upon a misuncler-standing, and that the United States Government are in fact in full sympathy with the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government. See the Washington telegram, No. 638, repeated to your Excellency [post p. 14-.]Please make an immediate communication to the French Government, rebutting their arguments on the above lines.Your Excellency should, at the same time, make it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot agree to substitute any proposal which would involve the abandonment of the policy of discussing with the German delegates in&apos; a neutral country the problem of the fixation and liquidation of the total German liability. To summon the German delegates to Paris to discuss that problem with the Reparation Commission would, in the opinion of His MajestyV Government, be no adequate Substitute for the policy which has been formally agreed upon between the Allied Governments. The question whether the Allied Governments are definitely pledged to the German Government to carry out that policy is immaterial. The-&apos;fact remains that the German Government were able to return from Spa without serious&apos; impairment of their position in Parliament and in the country, largely because they were able to point to the forthcoming conference at Geneva as a hopeful step on the road towards the solution of the problems with which Germany is confronted. To withdraw that hope will be to intensify that state of unrest and discontent in Germany which, both from the political and the economic point of view, is a constant menace to the interests of the Allied Governments.We therefore trust that the French-Government will reconsider their decision to abandon a policy to which they are pledged in common with ourselves and the Belgian Government, and to agree to the examination of the German plans for reparation at Geneva immediately after the close of the Brussels Conference, which may be expected about 10th October. We do not wish to contest the view of the French Government that it is impossible, for practical reasons, that the Geneva meeting should take place while the Brussels Conference is sitting, but we are. anxious that the Geneva Conference should not be postponed beyond the middle of next month.On 20th September Lord Derby telegraphed [No. 1109] that he had been asked to postpone this matter till after the election of the new President.French Prisoners in Russia. On 11th September Lord Derby telegraphed, -saying [?No. 1085] that it was officially announced in the Press that the President of the Council had sent a wireless telegram to the Soviet Government as follows : I note your declaration to Mr. Nansen and your acceptance of the French Governments proposal to complete as soon as possible the exchange of all French prisoners in Russia with all Russian prisoners in France. The French naval authorities are in a position to assure the departure of the last convoys of Russians in France by 18th September and in Algeria by 20th September. All Frenchmen. 20-4 C
should, therefore, be conducted before the end of September either to the Finnish frontier; or,. as regards those resident in southern Russia,, to Odessa. If on 1st October a. single Frenchman is retained in Russia against his will, I shall be obliged to cause such measures as may be considered indispensable to be taken by the French fleet in southern.Russia.. GERMANY.Ambassador in Borne. Mr. Kennard telegraphed from Rome ou 11th September [No. 414] saying that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that the Italian Government had agreed to receive Senator (sic) Gossler as German Ambassador in Rome. They had previously refused to&apos; agree to the appointment of von Lucius and other diplomats of the old regime, but they understood that Gossler was more satisfactory from every point of view.The French Charge d&apos;Affaires maintained that Gossler belonged to the reactionary^ party at Hamburg, and was regarded with distrust by the French Government.HUNGARY.Ministry. Mr. Athelstan Johnson reported [No. 493] from Budapest on 15th September that the Prime Minister had resumed the direction of affairs that day. It was probable that Count Imre Csaky would take- up the portfolio of the Minister of Foreign Affairs which the Prime Minister was giving up.French Enterprise. In a telegram (No. 497] dated 16th September, Mr. Athelstan Johnson affirmed the fact that tbe French were actively pursuing commercial negotiations with Hungary, and hinted at the possible promises of political support. His Italian colleague, with whom he had discussed this matter, was convinced that, so iar, no definite political treaty had been signed. The Minister of War had also assured him that, whatever commercial negotiations between Hungary and France might be under consideration, no military question with regard to them had been submitted to him.JAPAN.Sahhalien. On 15th September Sir Charles Eliot reported [No. 351] from Tokio the issue of a proclamation by the Commander of the Japanese force in Sakhalieu on 24th August, by which the authority of Russian officials was annulled as from 3rd July, which was the date of the Japanese Government s declaration of the occupation. The effect of tbe proclamation is to annul any administrative action taken by Russian officials since that date in regard to the transfer or grant of mining, forest, or other rights.Ussuri Railway. The Ambassador telegraphed [No. 359] on 17th December, that he had been informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that a decision had been arrived at to withdraw Japanese troops from Habavovsk, and to leave the Ussuri railway to be guarded by Russians from that point to Nikolsk. It had been reported that there were now no Japanese troops west of Harbin.PERSIA.Negotiations with&apos; the Soviet Government.- Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 622] from Teheran on .10th September that he had been informed by the Prime Minister of the departure of the Persian Special Envoy to the Russian Soviet Government from Tiflis for Moscow7. The Soviet Government had expressed their willingness to open the telegraph lines through Askabad to Meshed for the purpose of conducting nego-tiations. The conditions&apos;attached were that only official messages might be sent, and those sent by the Persian Special Envoy would be liable to be censored. Mr. Norman had advised the rejection of the latter condition as entirely opposed to diplomatic usage.Afghan Intrigues. On 10th September Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 621] saying that he had communicated to the Prime Minister his knowledge of reports, according to which the Afghan representative and his brother were intriguing with local Bolsheviks with the object of effecting an alliance between Persia and the Soviet Government through the mediation of Afghanistan. The Prime Minister admitted that he had received similar reports. A special mission was about to proceed to . Kabul bearing a letter and gifts in reply to a friendly letter accompanied by presents which the Shah had recently received &apos; from the Amir. The opportunity would be taken of protesting against the breach of diplomatic privilege .of which the Afghan representative had been guilty.    At the same time, a request which the Afghan
representative was constantly making to the Persian Government, viz., for leave to have a consular officer at Meshed to look after the interests of the numerous Afghans there, appeared to them to be perfectly reasonable. At the invitation of the Prime Minister, &apos; Mr. Norman inquired the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this matter.POLAND.Mission from General Wrangel. On 10th September Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 827] from Warsaw as follows : General.Makarov has arrived here as General Wrangeks representative on a special mission. His Chief of Staff, Colonel Gofman, has explained to.the British Military Mission that the objects of the Mission are : (1) To secure Polish co-operation in a joint plan of action against the Bolsheviks,their common enemy. (2) To discuss and clear up the question of Generahs Petlura&apos;s position in orderto see whether it is possible to co-operate with him.Colonel Gofman explained that his Mission did not intend or desire to induce the Poles to break off their negotiations with the Bolsheviks, although at the moment when it had left South Russia tbe Polish position was serious and peace negotiations had not been opened. In view, however, of the possible failure of these negotiations the Mission wished to reach a clear understanding with the Poles.General Wrangel would have no dealings with General Petlura if he clung to his view of an independent Ukraina ; his utmost concessions would be to have a federal Russia, one of the federated states being Ukraina. He preferred Machno as the true representative of Ukraina, as Machno wished to remain in Russia and had the largest following.General Wrangel would cany on the war until the Bolsheviks or he were crushed, notwithstanding the fact that the success or failure of the Polish negotiations with the Bolsheviks would greatly affect his position.General Wrangeks view of the Poles&apos; relations with federated Russia was said to be that Poland would simply be a military ally. It would be necessary to decide the question of their future- political relations after the success of their joint action. As regards the Russian force which Savinkoff was raising in Poland, General Wrangel would, consent to its use on the Polish front under Polish command if the Poles so desired, seeing.that it had been armed, equipped and fed by them at a considerable cost.PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA.Strike at Lourenco Marques. Reutefs agent at Capetown reported, on 10th. September, that a Portuguese official message had been received Rom Lourenco Marques via Johannesburg, and dated 5 p.m. 9th September, which stated that, apart from the railways, on which the service is necessarily restricted, all public departments were working normally, and that there was then nothing in the situation which gave rise to the slightest misgivings as regarded the maintenance of law and order.RUSSIA.British Subjects in Russia [F.C.R., xxiii, p. 10]. Under date of 11th September the following Note was sent from the Foreign Office to M. Xameneff: -M. Kameneff is aware that there still remain in Russia nearly two hundred British subjects who are apparently prevented by the Soviet Government from leaving the country. Of these, 12 civilians are imprisoned at Moscow, together with the British officers and men who have recently arrived there from Siberia.There are further approximately 60 British prisoners in the hands, of the Azer-baijan Soviet Government, whose release is being persistently obstructed.M. kamenoffs earnest attention is invited to the urgent necessity of arriving at a final settlement with regard to the release of all those categories in exchange for all the Russians who have not yet been repatriated, and he is requested, on his arrival in Moscow^, to impress on M. Chicherin and the other members -of the Soviet Government that a final and full settlement of this issue is essential if discussions for a resumption of trade are to be successful.The two main points of contention still outstanding concern : (1) The &quot; grave offenders &quot; mentioned in the agreement concluded in Copen-hagen between Mr. OrGrady and M. Litvinoff.   The Soviet Government have suggested that the unfortunate British subjects who have under-20-4 D
gone imprisonment for many months in Russia may he in possession of military information of possible value to their enemies. But His Majesty s Government are of opinion that, considering how long a time has elapsed since their arrest, this argument can no longer be sustained.(2) The British subjects captured at Baku. With regard to this category the Soviet Government contend that they have no direct means of ensuring their release, because the Republic of Azerbaijan has been recognized by them as independent. But the circumstances in which the Soviet Government of Azerbaijan was established make it clear that the con-nexion between the Moscow Government and the Baku Government is very close, and that if the former were to apply pressure to the latter such pressure would be effective.A copy of a message recently despatched to His Majesty:s representative at Copenhagen for communication to M. Litvinoff is attached, and also a list of British subjects who are known to be still in Russia.It may be necessary to supplement this list in the near future, and in this event the additional names will be communicated to M. Krassin for transmission to Moscow.On 11th September the following message was telegraphed [No. 238] to Mr. Leslie at Reval for transmission to M. Chicherin : Information has been received by His Majesty&apos;s Government from various British &apos; subjects recently repatriated to this country, that in spite of M. Litvinoffs assurances to the contrary, the Soviet authorities in towns, other than Moscow and Petrograd, have taken no steps, by press notice or otherwise, to inform the British residents in out-lying districts that facilities were being offered for their repatriation, and that it was only by chance that they themselves had heard of the opportunity by reading old Moscow or Petrograd newspapers which accidentally came into their possession.In view of these statements His Maj esty&apos;s Government trust that the Soviet Government will instruct all local authorities to publish as widely as possible the fact that British subjects are free to leave Russia.A further message for M. Chicherin was telegraphed [No.- 253] on 19th September, through the same channel: His Majesty&apos;s Government have learnt with great satisfaction from their repre-sentative in Finland, that six British subjects reached Terijoki on the 13th instant, having been repatriated from Russia.His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that the arrival of these persons may be taken to indicate that the Soviet Government is taking active steps to release all the British subjects still remaining in Russia, whose return to the United Kingdom has so long been awaited, and they would be glad to receive at an early date an authoritative statement from the Soviet Government on this subject, in order that they may immediately take steps with a view to resuming the repatriation of Russians at present in British Dominions. His Majesty&apos;s Government Avould further be glad to learn whether the Soviet Government is prepared to accept, and is in a position to put into prompt execution, the proposal in their telegram of 6th September that a full and general exchange of all British and Russian subjects should be effected on a date to be determined by mutual agreement.Soviet Resources. On 17th September Mr. Ramsay sent the following telegram [No. 258] from Stockholm : In an interview with the Social Demohraten before leaving yesterday, M. Kameneff admitted that the Russians have exported diamonds and other jewels with the knowledge of the Soviet authorities, as they needed assets in foreign countries for various purposes. He also said that Russia possessed such large stocks of diamonds that the Crown jewels had not been yet resorted to.He said also, that no other Government is possible for the present in Russia, and that liberty in Russia is still out of the question.SERBIA.- - Colonies for Russian Refugees [F.C.R., xxiv, p. 9].--On 15th September Sir Alban Young telegraphed [Nos. 274, 275] as follows :- I have now received a reply, of which the following is a summary, from the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government in regard to the establishment of a new Russian colony of 9,000 persons in this kingdom : (1) The present Russian colony and the new one must be treated in the same manner.
(2) Both must be under the direction of the existing Serb-Russian Committee.(3) As,a subvention to the expenses of the maintenance of the now colony, His Majesty&apos;s Government will only have to provide actual cash : the gum could not be less than 60,0001. per month, paid in advance. Accounts of the expenses with vouchers will, of course, be furnished to His Majesty&apos;s Government.(4) In addition to the above, 120,000/, will be required for the first installation (sic).(5) The payment of the sum for the maintenance of the refugees will continue so long as they remain in the kingdom.Sir Alban added that the terms of the note were not quite clear; and then went on to say [No. 275] that the system proposed by the Serbian Government was, in his opinion, the only practical one : in fact, he did not think that the Government would agree to the organization of such a colony by foreigners responsible to a certain extent to their own Governments.   The possibilities of friction were evident.The existing Serb-Russian Committee was in effect a Serbian Committee with (? Serbian Ministers) and ex- (? Ministers) on the Board and three Russian advisers. It appeared to be doing its work weR, and the Russian Minister testified that the Russian refugees were contented with its administration.Colonel MacGregor, the Inspector of the British Committee of the Russian Red Cross, who had been investigating conditions there, concurred in the above views. He was proceeding to London and would report to the Foreign Office on arrival, lie was quite of opinion that the establishment of our Russian refugees in Serbia was the best solution of the problem.The Serbian Government at present contributed (? three) million dinars a month for the maintenance of Russian reRigees alreadv in Serbia, who numbered from (? 9,000) to 10,000.New Electoral Laio. On 16th September Sir Alban Young sent [No. 280] the following notes on the electoral law which had just been promulgated in the Official Gazette : Article 4 defined the electoral districts. In Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina the present administrative districts, with few exceptions, would each form one electoral district. In Croatia and Slavonia each county formed an electoral district. Similar bases, but slightly varying to suit local circumstances, were established for the electoral districts in Slovenia, Dalmatia and other new districts. Montenegro within its old frontiers formed one electoral district. The Banat was divided into two electoral districts, and the remaining ex-Hungarian regions into three districts. All the electors of one district formed one electorate and together elected the deputies for the Constituent Assembly. The system was scrutin. de liste with representation of minorities and secret ballot.Article 5 stated that for every 30.000 inhabitants one deputy would be elected.Article 7 provided for the establishment of a State Commission which would be composed of such high judicial functionaries as the president of the Court of Appeal in Belgrade, the president of the High Court at Cettinje, &amp;c. This Commission would decide on the number of deputies proper to each district on the basis of its population, and it would have a representative presiding over the elections in each district who would secure the execution of the law.The elections were fixed for 28th November and the Assembly was to meet at Belgrade on 12th December.[For Serbian attitude towards Albania, see &quot; Albania.&quot;]TURKEY.Financial Situation [F.G.R., xxv, p. 12]. Telegraphing on 10th September [Nos. 1003, 1004], Admiral de Robeek said that it looked as if at last the breaking point had been reached ; the monthly requirements were about  T. 1,300,000, but on 31st August the money in hand was only some  T. 500,000, and the Government was without means of paying the pensions.and salaries then due.The desperate plight of the Government was shown by the nature of the suggested expedients ; wherever they looked for money they were confronted either by the attitude of the Allies during the armistice or with obstacles arising out of the terms of the treaty. The gloomiest view of the situation was taken by the Grand Vizier, and the general opinion was that the breakdown of the machinery of government was really in sight.   It might be found in the near future that the only
alternative to this breakdown would he the Abies themselves advancing money or guaranteeing an advance by the banks.Some attention should also be paid to the political aspect of the situation; a financial crisis might make Damad Ferid.&apos;s position untenable. In some quarters this, was thought so desirable in itself as to justify the postponement of relief till Ferid had been driven from office. The French High Commissioner agreed with those who * thought - that he should be got rid of at once. He himself attached but little importance to Ferid&apos;s retention of office ; we were giving him no support, though there was a widespread belief that we were keeping him in office for our own purposes, and his disappearance would put an end to a false position. But he found it difficult to foresee any suitable combination of ministers, and for the time being he was. slow to fall in with the suggestion of his French colleague that they should join in positive action designed to compel Fericbs resignation.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Geneva Conference. Sir Auckland Geddes telegraphed [No. 638] as follows on 15th September : I have had to-day a prolonged conference with the Secretary of State and the Assistant Secretary of State, from which it is clear that the United States Government are in complete agreement with what they understand to be the aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government, namely : (1) the establishment of a specified capital sum to constitute Germany&apos;s entire financial obligation for reparation ; and (2) direct discussion at Geneva between the Allied Prime Ministers and the German delegates to obtain German co-operation in the execution of the treaty. The attitude of the American delegate on tbe Reparations Commission is explained as follows : Certain decisions of the Spa Conference appeared to the State Department to violate the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and to invade prerogatives that were specifically delegated to the Commission. Accordingly the American representative proposed to reserve the &quot; rights and interests of other Powers, signatories of the Treaty of Versailles, but not parties to the Spa agreement.&quot;A resolution in this sense was eventually presented by the British delegates, and was regarded by the American delegate as covering the points which he wished to safeguard. This was regarded as a (? purely) formal reservation, and as a hint that certain technical questions were best left within the province of the Reparation Commission ; but the Secretary of State claims that it could not reasonably be construed into a disapproval of the principle of direct negotiations with the Germans on questions of policy. This Mr. Colby will make quite clear to the American representative of the Reparation Commission and\ to the French Government. He -will also furnish me with a memorandum in tbe above sense.While fully supporting the idea of the Geneva Conference, the Secretary of State is inclined to think that difficulties of time and space may make it desirable to postpone the Geneva meeting., for a few days.Committee to investigate Charges of Atrocities in Ireland. On 16th September Sir Auckland Geddes reported [No. 643] that the Press contained the announcement that under the auspices of the American journal The National, a committee of 100 persons was being organized &quot;to sift the charges of atrocities made against one another by the British Government and Sinn Fein.&quot; The announcement continued :  &quot; The Committee feels some neutral action is necessary in order to preserve Anglo-Saxon friendship, and to prevent the spread of ill-will; with the possibility of such irritation driving the two countries into war.&quot;Amongst those who were announced as having accepted were Senator Walsh, Mr. Hearst, and other anti-British persons. The commission was apparently to designate a small committee to sit at Washington next month, and both sides were to be invited to give evidence.   De Valera and Mrs. McSwiney would apparently appear.
