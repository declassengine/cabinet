Q ^SECRET.FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.
FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.The Frontier Question.- On 22nd November [No. 1583 S., received 1st December] the Viceroy of India reported that the Amir had written to Sir Alfred Grant, suggesting that he and the Government of India should each appoint a commissioner to settle frontier questions ; and asking that meanwhile we should refrain from hostile action against the tribes. Sir Alfred Grant had been instructed to inform the Amir politely that if he wished to pursue the matter he should address the Viceroy direct. He must know, the Viceroy added, what reply to expect in view of the emphatic refusal at the Rawalpindi Conference to admit any Afghan interference in regard to our frontier tribes.ARABIA.King Hussein and Ibn Saud. On 1st December Lord Curzon informed [No. 1285] Lord Allenby that Colonel Wilson was leaving England as soon as possible with instructions to try to induce King Hussein to meet Ibn Saud in person. His MajestyV Government had decided that Ibn Saud should not be approached officially until King-Hussein had expressed his willingness to meet him.AUSTRIA.The State Chancellor on the Situation. Telegraphing from Vienna on 26th November [No. 23, received by bag 2nd December], Mr. Lindley gave the following-account of a long conversation he had had with the State Chancellor, Doctor Renner, on 25th November : He began by saying that he desired to warn, all the foreign Representatives in Arienna that it was quite impossible to keep the newly-formed State of Germ an-Austria together much longer if the existing uncertainty as to food and fuel for the morrow continued.His policy was to carry out the Peace Treaty loyally, but the desire to join Germany was growing every day, and the Tyrol and Upper Austria and Styria would simply break away unless the present intolerable uncertainty came to an end.He denied that there was any disunion in the Government, which, on the contrary, had never been more united or more determined to see things through.The Communist danger he did not fear, though he knew that considerable sums of money were still coming from Russia, being smuggled through the Polish and German lines. He admitted that many Bolsheviks had been elected to the Workmen&apos;s Councils. This was because the mass of the workmen were heartily sick of them and did not vote. He had always known that the Councils would soon discredit them-selves, and he hoped the time would come to suppress them entirely before long. He was very much afraid of pure anarchy. I should mention that the Chief of the Police takes a much less optimistic view of the Communist danger, w&apos;hich is increased by the presence here of numerous Hungarian Bolsheviks, and will become more serious on the arrival of the 200,000 prisoners of war who are due in A^ienna this winter, and who will find the housing and living conditions intolerable. At the same time I incline to the view that political communism is much less.of a danger than pure anarchy.Doctor Renner then spoke of the extradition of Bela Kim and other Hungarian communists at present interned in Austria. He said that these men were securely held and that he thought it would be a j)political mistake to rouse public feeling by handing them over in the present circumstances. He hoped that by next summer the situation might have improved and. there was always time to have these people hanged. At the same time he would agree to the extradition if the Great Powers desired it. I replied that I had received no communication ou the subject from your Lordship and could not therefore say more than that I would report what he had said. My own view is that Doctor Renner is right and that these men had better be hanged later should they be proved to be the murderers they are believed to be.
Doctor Renner then spoke of the relations with Czecho-slovakia and expressed, the intention of himself visiting Prague in order to come to some arrangement as to coal, &amp;c. - He thought that the Czechs would be pleased at the humiliation of Vienna entailed by this visit. The idea seems somewhat childish, but I am assured that the Czechs really feel as the State Chancellor believes and I did what I could to encourage the visit. . , .Since seeing Doctor Eenner I have talked with several well-informed men who were - formerly opposed to union with Germany. They are unanimous in declaring that unless the existing uncertainty as to the future is relieved very quickly, German-Austria will break up. . -   .    ---The Elagcnfiirt Area. On 17th November [No. 12, received 22nd November], Mr. Lindley reported that Brigadier-General. Sir Charles Delme Pa deli fie, British Representative in the plebiscite area of Klagenfurt (who had been in Vienna that week) had explained the situation there and shown him his reports to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.It was clear from those reports and from the Generahs experience that the S.H.S. Authorities in zone A of the area had been for some time and still were (1) xDreventing all refugees likely to vote against them from returning to their homes ;(2) deporting systematically those whom thej7 considered in favour of an Austrian solution ;(3) making the demarcation line between zones A. and B into a closed frontier and thereby starving the inhabitants of the latter zone, since these had no source of supplies now that they could not draw on zone A.In short it was not too much to say that the methods which had made Macedonia notorious for so many years weredoeing systematically practised in the highly eivilized district of Klagenfurt.He, Mr. Bindley, submitted that that state.of things brought discredit on the Allies. It could apparently only be stopped by the ratification of the Austrian Treaty and the evacuation of,area A by the S.H.S. forces. An impartial plebiscite commission would then deal with all the results of the occupation. . . . The delay [in ratifying the Treaty] was, he added, exercising a disastrous influence ou the whole situation and prevented recuperation beginning in any sphere of activity. ...Scarcity of Flour. On 12th November the Austrian Government telegraphed to the Chairman of the Committee on Organization of the Reparation Commission, transmitting a letter received by the Vienna sub-committee from Dr. Lowenfeld Russ, who said that the insufficiency of flour and bread was daily making itself increasingly felt, as, in consequence of the increasing difficulty of transport, the arrival of grain and flour from abroad had been insufficient.THE BALTIC,New Esthonian Ministry. On 19th November the Deputy Commissioner at Reval reported [No. 82] that a new Esthcnian Ministry had been constituted that day with. Mr. Tencofson as Premier ; Mr. Birk, Minister for Foreign Affairs ; and Mr. Ivukk, Minister of Finance. Messrs. Tencofson and Birk were both members of the National Party.   Mr. Kukk had held the same post in the previous Government.The British- Fleet.--On 1 st December the Deputy Commissioner at Reval reported [No. 93] that the Eslhonian Prime Minister had sent him a letter in which he said that the Esthonian Government was sensible of the fact that for more than a year the British Fleet had clone inestimable service to the Esthonian Republic in its fight against the unprovoked attack of the Soviet Government.Esthonia desired to express heartfelt thanks for (group omitted).In the event of the British ships being withdrawn from Esthonian waters, the Esthonian Government felt that the Soviet Fleet would be a serious menace to the safety of their Republic .... In the circumstances the Government felt justified in begging that His Majesty&apos;s Government would prolong the stay of the British men-of-war in her waters; the British seamen, he added, were always most welcome guests of the Esthonian population,
BELGIUM.The 1839 Treaties. On 19th November Sir Eyre Crowe reported [No. .1589] that Monsieur Laroche had that morning explained to him that the 1839 Treaties now in existence were being revised, but that Belgium would not agree to revision unless the guarantees contained in them were continued in some form or other by Great Britain and France.If no revision could now take place the 1?39 Treaties with their guarantees would remain, whereas Belgium would be satisfied with the abolition of those treaties and a guarantee for a limited period until other measures could be taken by the League of Nations. Great Britain and France were therefore not being asked to incur any fresh obligation.On 2nd December Lord Curzon informed [No. 1428] Sir Eyre Crowe that His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to join the French Government in giving an interim guarantee of not more than five j-ears to Belgium, pending a future guarantee by the League of Nations, provided that as long as the new Anglo-French guarantee lasted the Belgian Government would give a guarantee for the neutrality of Belgium. These were the reciprocal features of the Treaty of 1839, and His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment felt that they could not fairly be asked to renew the obligation without receiving the corresponding security.BRAZIL.Approval of the Peace Treaty. On 26th November the following telegram [No. 218] was sent from Rio de Janeiro by Sir Ralph Eaget:-The President has sanctioned a Decree of Congress approving the Treaty of Peace with Germany and authorizing the Executive, to undertake the resulting expenditure. The formal ratification of the Treaty is expected to take place at the beginning of December.BULGARIA.Signature of the Peace Treaty. On 27th November Sir Ejtb Crowe reported [No. 1620] that the following instruments had been signed that morning at the Town-Hall of Neuilly-sur-Seine :  (1) The Treaty of Peace with Bulgaria ; (2) a Protocol additional to the Treaty of Peace with Bulgaria ; (3) a Protocol concerning the&quot; signature of the Treaty of Peace with Bulgaria ; and (4) a Convention concerning, the freedom of emigration of minorities, signed by Greece and Bulgaria only.THE CAUCASUS.Agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia.-Oi\ 24th November Mr. Wardrop-reported [No. 156] that the following agreement had been signed at Tiflis by the Prime Ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan : 1. The two Governments bind themselves to terminate the collisions now happening, and not to have recourse to armed force.2. They agree to take &quot;effective measures to repair and open roads leading to-Zangezur for peaceful traffic.3. They bind themselves to settle all disputed questions, including the frontier-question, by peaceful agreements pending the decisions of the Conference contemplated in the following section.In case it should prove impossible to reach a peaceful agreement, both sides bind themselves to select some neutral person as arbitrator and to accept his decision as binding.4. They bind themselves to appoint immediately delegates in equal number for a Conference at Baku on 26th November, to be transferred on 4th December to Tiflis, where the sittings will continue, unless by mutual agreement it be found necessary to transfer them elsewhere.This Conference will discuss all questions causing conflict or friction between the two Governments and will have full power to settle them by agreement or arbitration.5. The present agreement will be valid from the date of signature and will acquire permanent force on ratification by both Parliaments ; and the Presidents
bind their Governments to support and fulfil all the provisions of the above agreement honestly.Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 158], Mr. Wardrop reported that on the previous evening a banquet had been held to celebrate the signature of the agreement, at which the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan had said that his mind was at rest now that he had heard from her Prime Minister that Armenia really desired independence. The strife and bloodshed between the two nations had been due not to the peoples, who had lived as good neighbours for a thousand years, but to the politicians. Other speakers said that a strong confederation with wide autonomy was the only means of preventing that isthmus becoming a new Balkan peninsula. Active measures were, Mr. Wardrop added, being taken today the foundations of such a confederation.On 1st December Lord Curzon authorized [No. 108] Mr. Wardrop to inform the Azerbaijan Government that their case would receive sympathetic and friendly treatment, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government were concerned.The offer of Arms arid Munitions to Azerbaijan. On 25th&apos; November Mr. Wardrop reported [No. 158] that he had been informed by the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan that an offer of arms and munitions of war had been made on behalf of the Italian Government by Colonel Gabba, the head of the Italian Mission.In regard to this. Sir George Buchanan reported [No. 721] on 28th November that on the previous day he had- reminded the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that he had denied that an offer of arms had been made hy Colonel Gabba. In reply he had stated that when the Azerbaijan Government had asked for arms they had given the Italian Government to understand that His Majesty&apos;s Government had already offered to supply them. The Italian Government would certainly not do so until the independence of Azerbaijan had been officially recognized.Azerbaijan has &apos;also applied to France for arms and ammunition. On 18th November Lord Derby reported [No. 1183] that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had stated that the authorities of Azerbaijan had requested the French Government to provide them with a certain number of rifles together with an appropriate number of cartridges in exchange for raw materials. But.before considering the desirability of complying with this request the French Government asked for an expression of the views of His Majesty .&apos;s Government on. this subject.CHINA.Petition from the Outer Mongolian Government. On 24th November [No. 592a, received 1st December] Sir John Jordan reported that a presidental mandate of 22nd November had quoted the substance of a petition received from the Outer Mongolian Government, the gist of which was as follows :--The declaration of the independence of Outer Mongolia was instigated by foreigners, but the Mongolian people have obtained no benefit from it. The treaty with Russia has become totally ineffective in affording protection to Outer Mongolia, which has been threatened on the east by the intrigues of BuriaPs bandits and on the west hy Russians of both the Red and the White Parties. The Mongolian Government have therefore decided to cancel their autonomy and desire to be treated on the same footing as under the Ching dynasty. They renounce all sovereignty in internal and diplomatic affairs in favour of the Chinese Government, but express the hope (&apos;? that) the people may be allowed to retain enough of their internal privileges to make them happy to live as one of the five races of the Republic of China.The Russo-Chinese Mongolian Treaty, the Russo-Mongolian commercial agree-ment (? s and) all other Russo-Mongolian Declarations concluded simultaneously with the autonomy.of Outer Mongolia are repudiated and become henceforth inoperative. The Chinese Government declares itself ready to enter into negotiations with a future recognized Russian Government in regard to the position of the Russian merchants in Mongolia.The situation created by this move cannot fail to react unfavourably on the Tibetan negotiations and will require to be very carefully watched in connexion with the whole of the Tibetan question.Resolutions of the  Chamber  of  Commerce   Conference.-Ou 27th November [No. 507, received 2nd December] Sir John Jordan telegraphed as follows: The 6-1 B
ndAssociated British Chambers of Commerce of China and Hong Kong begs me to telegraph the substance of eight resolutions unanimously agreed to at the recent &apos; Conference : (1) The re-affirmation of the commercial open door ; the abolition of the sphere of influence and the development of an efficient railway s37stem.(2) The restoration to China of the Tsingtao port railway and its branches.(3) The restoration to China of freedom of action in regard to the reconstruction of the Chefoo Railway.(4) The strengthening of the Commercial Diplomatic Service.(5) A radical revision of the payment of the Civil Service in China.(6) The education of the Chinese on British lines by the remission of the Boxer indemnity.(7) The control by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the pnoduction and export of morphia and habit-forming drugs.(8) The release of further ships for the Eastern passenger trade.Nos. (2) and (3) of above were not on the Agenda and were treated confi-dentially.Tn view of the thoroughly representative nature of the Conference I feel bound to give the recommendations my warm support.CZECHO-SLO slovakia.The Czech Troops in Siberia.  On loth November Mr. Lampson sent the following-telegram [No. 934] from Vladivostock : The Czech representatives, Pavlu and Girsa, have, by order of the Government, sent a telegram to the Allied representatives, of which the followino; is the gist: The position of the Czecho-Slovak army has become so intolerable that they are compelled to apply to the Allied Powers for advice as to how its safety and free return home, already decided on with the consent of the Allied Powers, can be secured.The Czechs have (? conscientiously) protected the section of the railway assigned to them, but their presence on the line and its protection has become impossible, as their array&apos;s action is contrary to its aspirations and opposed to the fundamental dictates of justice and humanity. The army, against its convictions, is compelled to support (? the state of) absolute arbitrariness and iniquity, which prevails along the line, and under the protection of its bayonets the local military authorities commit acts which (? appal) the whole civilized world. The burning of villages, murders of peaceful Russian inhabitants by the hundred, and shooting without trial of demo-cratically inclined persons on the mere suspicion of political disloyalty occur daily, and the Czechs stand responsible in the eyes of the world for not having used their forces to prevent such unjust acts.Their inactivity is directly clue to their non-interference in the internal affairs of Russia, and they become, despite themselves, accomplices in the crimes committed. The Czecho-Slovak nation was, is, and always will be powerless (group undecypher-able). Messrs. Pavlu and Girsa feel it incumbent upon them to do their utmost to lay before the world the tragic moral position in which their army finds itself . . . - . There seems to them no other solution than the immediate evacuation of the section of the line assigned to the Czechs&apos; charge, save to grant to the Czechs the right to prevent all acts of injustice and crime by whomsoever committed.Situation in Slovakia. Telegraphing from Prague [No. 232] on 1st December, Mr. Gosling reported that he had been informed by Commander Barton that the newly formed Slovak-Hungarian League was working for the independence of Slovakia, which later would join Hungary. The inhabitants were quite determined not to remain part of Czecho-Slovakia,FINLAND.Social Democratic Congress. On 28th November Lord Acton reported from Helsingfors [No. 696] that the Social-Democratic Party Congress would be opened on 8th December by Mr. Yaino Tanner, leader of the party.
Aaldnd Islands. On 27th November Lord Acton reported [No. 691] that the Self-Government Committee had begun its second reading of the Bill for the grant of autonomy to the Aaland Islands on 24th November, and that it was expected that the Bill would be submitted to the Council of State early in the following week.GERMANY.The Situation. A wireless message from Nauen dated 26th November gives the following account : Herr Noske, Minister of Defence, has expressed his views to representatives of the Press as to the prospects of&apos;the Bolshevik efforts. He observed that it was hot impossible that German Communists were still maintaining a certain connexion with the Russian Bolsheviks, even though definite proofs of this, especially as to Russian financial support, might not be available. Noske pointed out&apos; also that some visionaries still believed in a world revolution. This hope, however, was a vain one, for neither the English, nor the French, nor the Italians would carry o\it a revolution within measurable time. The point, as to whether the danger of a Com-muriist revolution in Germany was still serious, or whether it had been eliminated, depended on how satisfactory an economic development took place. In regard to this point everything depended on whether the internal economic difficulties were aggravated by the Entente, as such action would furnish the Communists with fresh material for agitation. The danger of a counter-revolution by the Right was declared by Noske not to be a practical one. He desired especially to point out that a large part of the troops were quite non-political in character and only desired order and tranquillity. The non-commissioned officers, too, had no sort of wish to bring back the old regime. Nor had he any cause to doubt that a large number of officers were exerting therhselves to maintain orderly conditions in the country. Here Herr Noske reverted to his contention that the attitude of the Entente towards Germany was of importance to the whole of Europe. Noske drew attention to the slow but noticeable recovery of Germany. The inclination to work would increase as better food was procurable and production would then also become larger.Workmen^ (Jounclls.-On the same date a further wireless message from Nauen states that the Berlin evening papers anticipate that the Government parties will come to an agreement at an early date with regard to the question of Workmen&apos;s Councils. The crisis is considered to be solved. The Democrats have made con-cessions with a view to a compromise, concessions accepted by the Majority. Socialists and Centre as a basis for an understanding. The hopes of the reactionaries that the Government bloc would be split up have come to nothing. The German Nationalists are desirous of obstructing the results of the understanding which, it is expected, will be arrived at by the Majority parties, but they will be unable to prevent the law for Workmen&apos;s Councils being disposed of before Christmas.GREECE.&quot;Royalist Plot. Telegraphing from Athens on 24th November [No. 465], Lord Granville reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him that a military royalist plot had been discovered a week before, and that the four leaders and some seven other officers and five or six non-commissioned officers had been arrested, and a considerable number of military and naval officers removed as a precautionary measure. Those arrested had made confessions, which all agreed, although there had been no possible communication between the prisoners, so that the Government hoped (? thej^ had) now full knowledge of the plot, and that (? it had) definitely failed. The intention was to murder M. Venizelos, the acting Minister of War, and two or three other Ministers or supsrior officers, and to seize certain barracks and strategic points, and thus to assume power and recaH King Constantino.So far as the Government knew, no politicians were involved in the plot, which, was purely military.HUNGARY.Recognition of the Provisioned Government.- Telegraphing to Astoria from Budapest on 25th November [telegram unnumbered], Sir George Clerk reported that
lie had that day recognized, on behalf of the Supreme Council, the Provisional Govern-ment of Hungary. He had imposed as conditions that the Provisional Government should guarantee to every Hungarian national full civil rights including those of freedom to express political opinions, free right of meeting, a free press, and a free, secret, impartial, and democratic election based on universal suffrage ; that it should hold elections without delay ; that it should maintain law and order in the country ; that it should commit no aggressive action; and that it should respect, the pro-visional frontiers of Hungary pending the final definition in the Peace Treaty.On 1st December Sir Eyre Crowe, reporting [No. 1639] the arrival of Sir George Clerk in Paris, said that it was difficult to over-estimate the importance of the establishment at Budapest of a national Government representing all parties; the Supreme Council had shown its appreciation of the situation by immediately deciding to issue invitations to the Hungarian Government to send delegates forthwith to Paris for the opening of negotiations.ITALY.Alarmist Telegrams from Reuters Agent. On 28th November Sir George Buchanan reported [No. 722] that the Italian Foreign Office had received a telegram from the Italian Ambassador in London complaining of the alarmist telegrams sent by ReuteFs agent in regard to the situation in Italy. These telegrams were not only entirely without warrant, but prejudicial to Italian interests, and the Government would consider the expedienc)&apos; of his being expelled. Sir George added that he had expressed his agreement with the opinion that the telegrams in question were grossly exaggerated.The Socialist Party. On 28th November Sir George Buchanan reported [no number] that a meeting of the direction of the official Socialist Party had just passed a resolution welcoming the election results as an act, of solidarity with the Russian Soviet Republic, and as the expressed opinion of the Italian proletariat in favour of the immediate recognition of that Republic ; also as a victoiy for the Party&apos;s Maximalist programme, and as constituting a commission to prosecute that programme.....MEXICO.Position of Consular Officers. Mr. Cummins, telegraj)hing [No. 413] on 25th November, reports the holding of a meeting of the representatives of nine countries at which the outrageous treatment by the Mexican authorities of the American Consular Officer at Puebla was discussed. It was decided that the repre-sentatives should telegraph to their respective Governments a message to the following effect: That grave public disturbances might be expected in the coining year arising out of the Presidents election and other factors. That in protecting their nationals, Consular Officers might be exposed to conditions of violence, and therefore it was essential to impress on the Mexican Government and people that Consular Officers must be treated with respect, That the Governments represented at the meeting be invited to consult together to find a means of conveying the impression that Consular Officers could not be ill-treated with impunity, without which the protection of their respective nationals could not be effected.Telegraphing [No. 416] again on 27th November, Mr. Cummins reported that the Mexican Government had expressed their regret that they could not release the United States Consul, for the principal reason that the matter was sub judice in the Puebla Courts.NORWAY.Representation in Parliament. On 30th November Sir M. Find lay telegraphed . [No. 1369] the following information : After preliminary negotiations between party leaders, concerning Ararious proposals for changing paragraph 57 of the Constitution, providing that country constituencies should elect two-thirds of the deputies to Parliament and towns one-third, and other paragraphs concerning the electoral system, debates have taken place during the last three days resulting yesterday in
the adoption hy 92 to 34 of a proportional representation for town and country constituencies, the smaller towns to he-formed into groups of boroughs. A proposal to adjourn the consideration of the proposed changes was defeated by 89 to 37, after warnings by the leader of the Parliamentary Socialists that delay would be dangerous, a vdew which was^ supported by the Prime Minister and other leading speakers.&apos; Eighty-four votes, i.c, two-thirds of the total members, are necessary to pass changes in the Constitution.PERU.Peace Treaty approved. Telegraphing from Lima on 18th November [No. 162], Mr. Manners reported that the Peace Treaty and the League of Nations had been approved by Congress.POLAND.Political Crisis. On 28th November Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 443] that all the Ministers had placed their resignations in the hands of the Prime Minister and that the sittings of the Diet had been adjourned to 5th December, when the Prime Minister was expected to communicate the composition of the new Cabinet to the House.Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 445] Sir Horace Rumbold reported that when the members of the Cabinet had been called upon by Mr. Paderewski to resign, several of them had pointed out that he should resign with them.RUMANIA.The Ultimatum. On 26th November Mr. Rattigan reported [No. 522] that he had had a conversation with Mr. Maniu which had lasted from 9.30 pan. till 2.30 a,m. Mr. Maniu had told him that as the ultimatum stood its acceptance was a practical impossibilitj^, to which he had replied that the Conference was determined to be played with no longer. Mr. Maniu then said that, with the best goodwill, it was impossible to accept the ultimatum within the term at present fixed, and he asked that a short extension of time should be granted to enable delegates to go to Paris to explain the Rumanian objections to the actual form of the clauses. In regard to evacuation he would propose that the Rumanian troops should provisionally retire, but only withdraw to the line now proposed when Hungary had accepted the peace terms. Mr. Rattigan then told him that though he could hold out no hope of the concessions being granted, he would use what small influence he had to secure a short extension of time.RUSSIA.Relations of Soviet Russia with other Governments. In reply to enquiries from the Foreign Office [No. 1396] as to the relations between Soviet Russia and other Governments, Sir Eyre Crowe telegraphed [No. 1603] on 23rd November that the substance of the replies received was as follows :  Sioeden. The Swedish Government has broken off all relations with Soviet Russia since the beginning of the present year. The Swedish Government has no legal right to enact a general prohibition on Swedish subjects entering into business relations with nationals of another State, but has taken the following measures, which are in practice effective : (a) There is a prohibition on shipping of over 200 tons leaving a. Swedish port for a foreign port without a licence.No licence is granted to ships bound for Soviet Russia. Having learnt the instructions issued to British and French ships in the Gulf of Finland, the Swedish Government will do all in its power to prevent the possibility of Swedish ships exposing themselves to these measures.6-1C
(b) So far as export prohibitions are still in force in Sweden, no licence is granted for Soviet Russia.(c) No passports are issued for Soviet Russia without special, authoriza-tioh from the Swedish Government.(d) The principal banks have undertaken not to facilitate banking transactions with Soviet Russia, Import and export of roubles is prohibited.(e) All correspondence, postal or telegraphic, is suspended.Denmark. The Danish Government has had no relations with Soviet Russia since (? November) 1918-    The situation in Denmark corresponds . to the desire expressed by the Allied and Associated Powers, and in particular the &apos; Danish Government has put in force the following measures : (a) Instructions have been given to the local Customs to inform the Central Customs Office of any application for clearance papers for Soviet Russia.   No such applications have in fact been received.(5) So far export prohibitions are (? still) in force in Denmark; no licences are issued for Soviet Russia.Where no export prohibitions exist measures under (a) apply, (c) No passports for Soviet Russia are issued without special reference to the Ministry of Justice.4(cZ) and (e) The same as for Sweden. Finland. The Finnish Government are pursuing the policy indicated in the Allied Note.   For humanitarian reasons (? passports) are issued for entry into Finland of non-Bolshevik refugees, this being considered one of the special cases indicated under paragraph (c) of the Allied Note.Holland. The Netherlands Government have no relations with Soviet Russia, and all commerce is suspended.Spain. The Spanish Government approve these proposals (? and have) taken the necessary measures.Sioitzerland. The measures indicated are conformable to those already in force in Switzerland.Norway. No reply has been received, but the Norwegian Foreign Office have informed the French Minister that the measures indicated have already been taken by Norwegian Government, which for a long time has severed relations with Soviet Russia.Central and South American Neutrals. No replies have yet been received.Siberia.The Situation. Mr. Lampson telegraphed [No. (? 9) 36] on 17th November [a message not received until 24th November] information received by him from Irkutsk that although the situation was bad, and arrests were continually taking place, no immediate disturbances were anticipated because so many different parties were concerned. All, Ixrwever, seemed to be unanimous on one point, and that was the downfall of Kolchak. At the same time there were indications of a growing tendency in favour of Senienoff.On 21st November Mr. Lampson telegraphed [No. 952] his appreciation of the situation to the following effect : The removal of the Government to Irkutsk was wuse, and it was now essential that this place should be the centre of all administration, while Kolchak and his military advisers devoted themselves exclusively to the conduct, of the war. Under such conditions Kolchak might remain at the head of affairs, but it was to be remarked that he himself, and not the Government as formerly, was now the subject of attack. The Army had fallen to pieces in retreat, and the men distrusted their officers, who in turn had no confidence in their chiefs. Mr. Lampson considered that there was an end to militant anti-Bolshevism in Siberia. A large group of officers had congregated round Semenoff, whom he would be unable to maintain, and his troops were mostly unreliable. The outcome of events would be largely governed by the fate of the Omsk armies.Turkestan.Afghan Influence. On 18th November the Viceroy transmitted [No. 1562 S-] information received by General Malleson from Merv that the Afghans were acting in
opposition to the Bolsheviks in many ways, and were generally supporting local people against Bolshevik enforcement of communist principles, thereby acquiring much popularity in the district.On 26th November the Viceroy transmitted [No. 15903] a telegram from General Malleson, dated 24th November, reporting that the Tashkent Government had sent the Bolshevik Commissary Ivanov to Merv with orders to counteract the growing-Afghan influence in the Merv district.&apos; although with the ostensible object of reorganizing local administration and of stopping the oppression of previous Bolshevik officials.SERBIA.Financial Conditions of the Treaty. Telegraphing from Belgrade on 29th November [No. 384], Sir Alban Young reported that an endeavour was to he made to procure a modification of the financial conditions of the Com-ention attached to the Treaty, and that in consequence of a hurried decision of the Council of Ministers the Crown Prince had left (? for Paris) accompanied by two of the Ministers.SPAIN.Labour Unrest.
