FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.ARABIA.The British Representative at Jeddah. On 4th December Lord Allenby reported [No. 1662] that he had decided that Colonel Vickery should continue to act as the representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government at Jeddah as he thought it would be nnwise to make a change in view of the altered circumstances in the Hejaz since the time when Colonel - Wilson went on leave. Lord Allenby added that he had been entirely satisfied with Colonel Vickery&apos;s handling of the situation, and the fact that Colonel Wilson&apos;s return in the altered circumstances might lead King Hussein to hope for a reversal of the present policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government had guided him in making his decision. There was no reflection on Colonel Wilson, whom he had recommended for recognition.[Colonel Cyril Wilson, C.M.G., D.S.O., was appointed to Jeddah in July 1916, and, till his recent leave, conducted the negotiations with Mecca,]ARMENIA.Agreement with, the Kurds. Telegraphing from Constantinople on 11th December [No. 2135], Admiral cle Robeck reported that he had been informed that an agreement between the Armenians and the Kurds had been signed in Paris. His informant was Shaykh Abdul Kadir, who entirely approved of it; and the news had been confirmed by the Armenian patriarch.AUSTRIA.General Situation. On 5th December Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 37] as follows : The situation here has been so critical since my arrival that my telegrams and despatches have necessarily been devoted to the need of tiding over the next few months or even days. I fear that this may have given the impression that temporary-relief would afford a permanent solution of the Austrian problem. I venture, there-fore, to submit that, unless the Allied Governments are prepared to give credits for such a sum as, say, 40,000,000Z. sterling, Austria can only become a self-supporting and stable country on two conditions :  (1) That the Allies publicly renounce the intention of extracting any reparationfrom Austria for a period, say 15 years. (2) That during that period she be allowed to pledge her resources to their full extent.The first condition would, it is true, be to some extent a confession of failure; but I have yet to meet the person who seriously expects to get any reparation from this country unless it is first nursed back to health. This process needs time and confidence but those best acquainted with the country are the most hopeful that it could be clone if a far-sighted and liberal policy were followed by the Allies. It is clear that the system of doles and makeshifts devised at the eleventh hour, not only demoralizes and exasperates the population, but is costly to the Allies without bringing them any nearer to their object.If the two conditions above-mentioned were fulfilled the Allies would still have to exercise stead\- and effective pressure on the Governments of the new States to induce them to follow a friendly commercial policy towards Austria. For hundreds of years trade has followed certain channels in Central and South-Eastern Europe, and lines of communication have been developed accordingly. These channels and lines have been suddenly blocked without any time being allowed for readjustment. The result is economic chaos and the starvation of certain districts quite close geographically to other districts having a superfluity of foodstuffs. The difficulties barring the passage either of persons or goods over the new frontiers have to be experienced to be realized.Vorarlberg. On 2nd December Mr. Linclley reported [No. 28] that the Provincial Assembly of Vorarlberg was about to consider the question of declaring provincial independence as a preliminary to voting for union with Switzerland.It was to be feared, he said, that, if this should be permitted by the Allies, the remaining provinces would in turn decide for union Avith Germany.
Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 32], Mr. Lintlley reported that the State Chancellor had called the serious attention, of the representatives of the five Great Powers to the encouragement given by the Swiss Government to the movement in Vorarlberg in favour of union with, Switzerland, and had said that his Government had done all that they could to discourage this movement, but in vain. Unless the Powers forbade the union without any further delay, Tyrol, Styria, and perhaps other Austrian provinces would certainly declare their independence of Vienna; the capital would then be completely isolated, and an outbreak of despair would be inevitable.Telegraphing again [No. 35] on 4th December he said that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, no doubt, were aware that, apart from political considerations, the retention of Vorarlberg was of great importance to Austria. The district was rich in cattle and other agricultural resources, and had an important textile industry with much water-power. .... The district was in fact for its size perhaps the most important in new Austria,Tyrol. On 8th December Mr. Lindley reported [No. 42] that he had learnt from a good source that the Italians, backed by the Germans, were carrying on a strong-agitation in Austrian Tyrol in favour of union with Italy. The provincial patriotism of Tyrol had always been strong, and this would seem to be the only means of provincial reunion. The Germans desired it in order to have a direct frontier with Italy.The Social Democratic Party at Innsbruck recently declared that union with Germany was the only solution of their difficulties, but it was doubtful whether they had much hold in the province generally.Telegraphing again three days later [No. 45] he reported that the following-resolution had been unanimously adopted at Innsbruck on 11th November in the Tyrol Provincial Assembly : The Provincial Assembly and the Government were required, in order to save the country from complete destruction, to begin negotiations at once -with the Government at Vienna in order that the latter might obtain from the Supreme Council in Paris that Tyrol and Germany should form one economic unit. The resolution was reported to have been telegraphed to Dr. Renner at Paris. The various speakers laid stress on the view that without speedy assistance from outside Austria must in a few months fall a prey to complete anarchy, and Tyrol must save herself in time.THE BALTIC.The Dorpat Negotiations. On 11th December Lord Acton, telegraphing from Helsingfors, reported [No. 733] as follows in regard to the negotiations at Dorpat &quot;between the Bolsheviks and Esthonia: On 4th December, the day when those negotiations began, the Bolsheviks declared that they were willing to accept an armistice, but two clays later they demanded the conclusion of peace. The Bolshevik attitude proved still more menacing on 8th December, when there was a resumption of the negotiations which had been temporarily broken off.According to a Helsin.;o-for s newspaper published on the 11th the Bolshevik peace terms were as follows : (1) The recognition of the Soviet Government by Esthonia ; (2) the withdrawal of both armies to their own territory ; (3) a full amnesty for all political prisoners ; (1) the resumption of diplomatic and commercial relations;. (5) the disbanding- of all foreign armies on Esthonian territory.To these terms, which had been published, secret clauses had been added by the Bolsheviks requiring the expulsion of all foreign warships from Esthonian waters, and the breaking off of relations with all States at war with Soviet Russia, and the placing of all Esthonian ports at the disposal of the Bolsheviks, Reval being at once declared a free harbour.At a Cabinet Council held at Reval on 9th December the Esthonian Government had decided to send Mr, Hanko, the Minister of AVar, to ask the advice of the Finnish Government and to beg its help. He had arrived on the 10th and had had long interviews with the Finnish Ministers, and on the evening of the 11th his communications had been considered by a Cabinet Council, at which the four chief generals were present. It had been decided that the reasons which had dictated Finnish policy in regard to intervention in Russia held good, but that the Finnish representatives in Washington, Paris, and London should bring the matter before the Allied and Associated Powers.
BELGIUM.The Neutrality Question: Oh 4th December Sir Eyre Crowe reported from Paris [No. 1651] that he had been assured by the Belgian delegates that if the Allies suggested that Belgium should return to a state of complete neutrality, even for five years, there would be an upheaval in the country. Such a suggestion would be regarded as an invitation by His Majesty&apos;s Government to Belgium to renew friendly relations with Germany.The Elections. In a despatch dated 3rd December [No. 444], Sir Francis Villiers gave the results of the elections with comments thereon as follows : The Senate will be composed of 59 Catholics, 35 Liberals, and 25 Socialists. It appears that six Liberals were elected among the Socialists, and it is not known to which party they will give their support. The committee appointed for the verifica-tion of elections will have to decide whether the Socialists who Avere elected without possessing the necessary property qualification will be allowed to take their seats. -In the Chamber of Deputies the parties are divided as follows : Catholics	- -	-	-    71Liberals	-	-	-    34Socialists	-	-	-         -  . 70Middle Class Party   -	-	--	-    : 1Christian Democrats	-	-	- .    2Daensistes -	-	-	2Combattants	-	--	-   -   -      2Front Party .		-	o ORenaissance Nationale		-	1			186The Catholics therefore lose 28 seats, the Liberals lose 12, and the Socialists gain 31.The Middle Class Party, AAdrich has not had conspicuous success at the elections, was formed to protect the bourgeois interests. The deputy elected will probably vote with the Catholics.Two members have been returned as Christian Democrats, and, as before, the Daensistes have secured a couple of seats. The latter party was founded many years ago by the Abbe Daens and has since maintained a precarious existence. The general principle of both these factions is that there is no real incompatibility between Catholicism and Socialism. Their votes are sometimes giA^e on one side and some-times on the other.In the case of the Combattants two members have been returned to aawocate extreme views in regard to pensions, compensation, &amp;c, for soldiers who served in the war.Front Party is another name for Activism, and it is somewhat remarkable that three members should have been returned to represent principles which are considered pro-German and are therefore much discredited.Although the Renaissance Nationale only gained one seat, the influence of this section is not unlikely to increase. The leading object is the abandonment of purely party politics and the concentration of interest upon national and international questions.The New Government, In a despatch [No. 445] dated 4th December, Sir Francis &quot;Villiers gaA-e a list of the iicav Cabinet as follows : -Prime Minister     - - - t n/i   ta i      -        ^  v \Minister of Finance      - - j Mr&quot; Delacr01x (Catholic).Minister of Justice - -   Mr. Vandervelcle (Socialist).Misister of Foreign Affairs -   Mr. Hymans (Liberal).&quot;^Minister of the Interior - -   Mr. Renkin (Catholic).&quot;&quot;Minister of Railways, &amp;c. - -   Mr. Pouilet (Catholic).Minister of War       .    - -   Mr. Masson (Liberal).Minister of the Colonies   - -   Mr. Franck (Liberal).Minister of Public Works - -   Mr. Anseele (Socialist).^Minister of Science and Arts        -   Mr. Destree (Socialist).Minister of Economic Affairs        -   Mr. Jaspar (Catholic).Minister of Industry, &amp;c. - -   Mr. Wauters (Socialist).Minister of Agriculture - -   Baron Ruzette (Catholic).[With the exception of those marked * the A-various members of the Government held the same offices in the last Cabinet.]
Sir Francis went on to say that the conditions upon which the Socialists continue to take part in the Government were made public at the special meeting of the Labour Party and are as follows : Democratic organization of national defence.Reduction of the period of military service to a minimum.Provision in the Constitution for universal manhood suffrage at 21 years of age.

The telegraphic correspondence arising from a speech made by Colonel Rowland-son to the Caucasian Mountaineers fully illustrates the difficulties amid which British officers are at present working in their endeavours to deal with political matters in territories of the former Russian Empire.In this particular instance Colonel Rowlandson was ordered to proceed to Ternir-khan-Shura with the concurrence of the Foreign Office, and with the object of securing peaceful relations between the Volunteer Army and the unruly inhabitants of Daghestan. This officer, who has had considerable experience of the tribesmen with whom he was dealing, apparently judged that the only way to impress his audience was to adopt a line of argument indicating the evil results that would overtake those who continued to foment disorder in General Denikin&apos;s rear.Violent exception was taken to this speech by the Governments of Azerbaijan and Georgia, who protested to Mr. Wardrop, the British political representative at Tiflis, who in turn took up the cudgels energetically on their behalf.While admitting that upon reading the text, of Colonel Rowlandson&apos;s speech in cold print it would appear that certain parts could have been better expressed, it seems desirable to point out that it is necessary to consider the character of the audience for whom it was intended.Colonel Rowlandson was addressing, not a body of polished diplomats, but the representatives of half-civilized tribesmen to whom a threat of force was the only argument which carried any weight. At any rate, the speech seems to have had the desired effect, and it has drawn no protest from the tribes affected, unless an effusion from the discredited Allied Uedjliss is to be taken seriously.Colonel Rowlandson^ reference to the Georgian and Azerbaijan nationals, who have been intriguing in Bolshevik interest in Daghestan, appears, however, to have touched the Governments of Georgia and Azerbaijan upon a tender spot. This is remarkable seeing that they disclaim any connexion with these intriguers, who, they say, are acting without their sanction and contrary to their wishes.Putting aside the specific case referred to above, it is felt, in general, that-it is not so much the British military representatives who are at fault, but the position in which they are placed by the absence of a settled and co-ordinated policy towards the territories and races of the former Russian Empire.The military representatives in these regions find themselves confronted almost daily with situations requiring instant decisions, and it would be indeed marvellous if they invariably succeeded in interpreting in every detail the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government and in avoiding- a chance word capable of being magnified into &quot;a diplomatic incident.For these reasons it is feared that unless British policy in the Caucasus and South Russia is co-ordinated, incidents of a similar nature must inevitably occur in the future, whether the offenders be military officers or diplomatic repre-sentatives.CHINA.China and Thibet. On 4th December Sir John Jordan reported [No. 612 ?] that he had di&amp;eussed the Thibet question with the Acting-Minister for Foreign Affairs. The latter had disavowed all intention of coercing the Thibetans, and had suggested that if Great Britain would make a clear statement of her policy, a settle-ment would be facilitated. When asked for an explanation he gave it as follows. The dispute between China and Thibet was, he said, an internal matter which China should settle in her own wajr, and she did not see why Great Britain should interfere. The Thibetans had no grievance against the Chinese, and they had been instigated by outsiders to fight, just as the Mongolians had been : that ttmy had received munitions from India Avas a matter of common knowledge.Sir John Jordan challenged the justice of these allegations, and said that personally he should be prepared to submit the whole matter to the League of Nations ; to which the Minister replied that he had no faith in the League of Nations -might was still right. If Great Britain Avoulcl stand aside China would be able to settle the business directly Avith the Thibetans. Sir John replied that by overawing the Thibetans, China might negotiate an agreement with them as she had done with the Mongolians, though she might find the task a very different one.The Minister then complained that Great Britain Avas keeping China and Thibet apart by closing the Indian route to Lassa ; and in conclusion suggested that an arrangement might be reached on the basis of a treaty, signed by China and Thibet as principals, appiwed and witnessed by Great Britain.
Sir Jolm added that his impression was that China had definitely decided to wait until the Thibetans grew weary of the situation, and then by assurances of autonomy and favourable treatment, to win them back to Chinese allegiance. China realized that she was deeply committed to us by her acceptance of the Simla treaty in principle, with the exception of the boundary clause, and knew that in going back on her written offers she had put herself in the wrong.FINLAND.League of Nations. On 7th December Lord Acton telegraphed [No. 723] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed him of&apos; the unanimous recpuest of the Cabinet that arrangements might be made for the admission of Finland as an accessory member of the League of Nations. : The Minister said that he knew the country was in favour of adherence to the League. Earlier in the year the Paris delegation had discouraged him from raising the question until after the meeting of the hrst Conference of the League, but as no immediate meeting of such a Conference appeared probable he wanted action to be taken forthwith to carry out the wishes of the executive. Lord Acton expressed his personal opinion that the adherence of Finland would strengthen her position with regard to the A aland Islands question, should the Paris Conference leave the task of its settlement to the League of Nations.north-Western Karelia. Lord Acton reported [No. 74b] on 13th December that according to information received from a member of the Finnish General Staff, the inhabitants of North-Western Karelia advocated union with Finland. The inference drawn was that the North Russian Government is distrusted by the Finns, who fear that should the former give consent to the cession they might subsequently withdraw it and that then England would not be prepared to support the Finnish claim. The desire of the Finns for North-Western Karelia was only the thin end of the wedge, the ice-free port of Murmansk being the true objective. &quot;&apos;Aaland Self-Government Bill. Lord Acton telegraphed [No. 741] on 12th December that the report of the Committee charged with preparing the Bill for the grant of autonomy to Aalancl had been published that day. The report was unanimous and no reservations had been made.In the preamble to the Bill the Committee stated that the isolated position of Aaland had undoubtedly been one cause of the separatist movement, and that special legislation was therefore considered to be necessary. The Committee held that this separatist movement would only disappear if the population of Aaland had binding-guarantees against any menace of its nationality from Finland in the future. These guarantees were now provided by giving the population power to order its own conditions within as wide limits as the unity of the State could allow. The Committee wished to give Aalancl a certain right to local legislation. If local laws were to be independent of ratification by the State, however, they would have to be limited to a very small number of matters. The Committee therefore proposed, in order to make the number as large as possible, that the local administration should be in the hands of the Provincial Assembly and the President of the Republic. The Committee finally thought it essential that Aalanders should be assured that their self-government would not be altered without their agreement.Following the above, Lord Acton telegraphed [No. 742] on the same date that in commenting on the Aaland Self-Government Bill the Swedish Press there stated that the general demands made in the declaration in the Swedish Parliamentary group had been satisfied in the Bill in all essentials and considered the proposals highly satisfactory.GERMANY.Situation in East Prussia. The following wireless message was despatched from Nauen on 12th December : Now that the Prussian Minister of the Interior has returned from East Prussia, it has become known that a very great anxiety is felt among the East Prussian population lest they should be suddenly attacked by Lithuanians, Letts and Bolsheviks, as East Prussia is almost- undefended and lies exposed to any hostile irruption. It is reported from Tilsit that the local Communists are making preparations for disturbances, in order to give the Lithuanians a pretext for entering the town, but the competent authorities at Berlin are not afraid of such schemes succeeding, as the frontier guards are sufficiently strong to deal with the 6-3 0
matter. It turns out that the excesses in Lithuania, attributed by the Lithuanians to German troops, are actually committed by Lithuanian bands, who scour the country, plundering on their way. The bad condition of the roads seems to have delayed the return of German soldiers from the Baltic States. Sudden attacks by Lettish bands on the returning Germans still continue to be reported.HUNGARY.The Socialist Members of the Government. On 15th December Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 50] from Vienna as follows :-I saw the Hungarian Minister this morning and told him that I was somewhat disquieted by rumours I had heard of the intention of the Socialists to leave the Hungarian Government. I pointed out the necessity of keeping the Government, as constituted during Sir G. Clerk&apos;s visit to Buda Pesth, together until the elections. The departure of the Socialists before Peace was signed would have a deplorable effect, and every reasonable concession should be made by the Government to induce them to remain.The Hungarian Minister said he entirely agreed with me and would report what I have said to his Government. He believed that the Prime Minister realized the importance of this question and was strong enough to induce the less moderate members of his Cabinet to make any concession necessary to retain the Socialists. His latest information was that the latter were Less inclined to leave than j:hey had been ten days ago.  .RUSSIA.Siberia.Austrian Prisoners of War. Telegraphing from Vladivostock on 3rd December [No. 977], Mr. Lampson reported that the state of the Austrian prisoners was pitiable, and that the Allied representatives had that day decided to appeal to their Govern-ments for aid pending repatriation. Relief was urgently required to save them from perishing from cold or starvation during the coming winter. According to the figures available there were in the Siberian territory still unoccupied by the Bolsheviks about 55,000 Austrians and 10,000 Germans; the latter were apparently rather better off, receiving relief from their Government through the Swedes.....The American and (? Japanese) representatives had taken the matter up actively, and were confident that if funds were forthcoming they could provide the necessary (? organization). The abject condition of the prisoners, Mr. Lampson said, was indisputable, and he would beg the favourable consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government of an application for funds.A similar appeal had been addressed to the American, Japanese, Italian, French and Chinese Governments, all of whom had shared the earlier expenses of the prisoners of war.Mr. Larnpson said that he had stated his doubts as to whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would feel able to respond in view of the vast sums already sunk in Russia, but if it were possible he much hoped that we might bear our share in this urarent humanitarian Work.NORWAY.Municipal Elections. In a telegram [No. 1372] dated 4th December, SirM. Findlay reported that the municipal elections on 2nd December had resulted in Christiania and the principal towns in the general success of the Conservatives over the Socialists, a result which indicated an even stronger re-action against the Bolsheviks than had. been expected.PANAMA.Presidential Election. Reporting [No. 93] on 10th December, Mr. Bennett stated that the Acting Consul at San Jose had telegraphed that Julio Acosta had been elected President by a large majority, although the official result has not yet been published.The Acting Consul further reported that his United States colleague had expressed his private opinion that diplomatic relations with Washington wordd shortly be renewed.
POLAND.New Ministry. On 14th December Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 480] that a new Ministry had been formed by Mr. Skulski, leader of the National Populist Association ; the Minister of the Interior in the late Cabinet continued in office in the same capacity : Mr. Patek had been asked to accept the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs ; and General Pilsudski would be appointed Minister of War.Mr. Paderewski, Sir Horace added, had refused to represent Poland at the Peace Conference, and General Rozwadowski would be appointed to that post.MANIA.New Ministry.- On 5th December Mr. Rattigan reported [Nos. 546 and 547] that a Ministry had been formed as follows :-for  Foreign- Mr. Vaida Vaivode.- General Avereseu.- Mr. Rascano.- Mr. Aurel Vlad.- Mr. V. Boutescu.- Mr. Popovici.- Mr. I. Pelivan.- Mr. O. Goga.- Mr. Ylad  for  the present, later Mr. Raducano.- Mr. Pop.- Mr. Halipa.- Messrs. B. Inculetz and Jean Cantacuzene.This Ministry, Mr. Rattigan said, should be strong as it included the leaders of all parties, save the Liberals, with the exception of Mr. Take Jonescu. The latteFs criticisms of Vaida have been so outspoken that he could scarcely be included in the Ministry. This is to be regretted, as though he, Mr. Rattigan, had no very high opinion of Take Jonescu as a statesman, yet he was an ardent Entente (two groups unclecypherable), and would have been very useful to us.Prime   Minister and   MinisterAffairs Minister of Interior   -Minister of WarMinister of Finance   - - -Minister of Agriculture -Minister of Public WorksMinister of JusticeMinister of Public InstructionMinister of Commerce (Peasants&apos; Party)Minister for Transylvania Minister for Bessarabia -Ministers without portfolioSPAIN.Neio Ministry.
