FOREIGN  COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Report that the Amir has been murdered. On 16th June the Viceroy of India, telegraphed [No. 745 S.] saying that the report of the murder of Amanulla should he regarded with reserve in spite of its apparent authority. Had there been a coup d&apos;etat at Kabul it was almost certain that direct news would have reached India by that time. Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 757 S.], he said that there was still no news of the assassination, but the Afghan delegates&apos;at Mussoorie had lately received news of a serious though abortive rising at Kabul in favour of Inayatulla,Raiding by Jamshidis. The Viceroy, telegraphed on 16th June [No. 748 S.] that information, dated 14th June, had been receivetl from Meshed to the effect that it was reported from Herat that the Amir was greatly annoyed at the continual Jamshidi raidings ; the raiders were patronized by the Russians.ALBANIA.The Situation. On 22nd Juue Sir George Buchanan reported from Rome [No. 263] that the Minister of War bad given the Military Attache the following information regarding the situation in Albania : The Albanian attacks were confined to the A&quot;alona zone and were delivered by Mohamedan bands acting independently of the Tirana Government, with which Italian relations are friendly, The Italians attribute the attack to Turkish propaganda and the desire of the Albanians to drive the Italians out of Albania before the Greeks and Serbians respectively attempt to occupy southern and northern Albania.No attacks have been made on Santi Quaranti, which It is proposed to evacuate as soon as the stores have been removed, on Durazzo, where there is a small garrison acting as escort to the Italian High Commissioner which will remain there, or on the Scutari zone, where the situation is normal. The Italian garrison at Antivari has been withdrawn.The Italians are satisfied that they can hold their own at Valona where 5,000 reinforcements have landed : they hold Bistrova and Canina. On the 19th, strong patrols reconnoitred to the river Suscitza and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. The Albanians number about 7,000 and hold the high ground south of Valona which is beyond the field of artillery range of the town.Telegraphing agaiu on 24th June [No. 268], Sir George said that he had had a conversation with the President of the Council, who had once more assured him that he had no desire for a mandate for Albania. The complete independence of Albania would please him ; but he thought that Serbia and Greece should abandon their claims in the north and the south, if Italy renounced her claim to a mandate.ARABIA.King Hussein and Ibn Saud [F.C.R., xviii., p. 3]. On 21st June [Nos. 555 and 556] Lord Curzon instructed Lord Allenby to communicate the following message to King Hussein if he saw no objection to so doing : His Majesty&apos;s Government have received with much gratification the intimation that your Majesty has consented to meet Ibn Saud at. Aden. They are happy to inform you that Ibn Saud has similarly expressed his readiness to meet your Majesty. He has, however, suggested as an alternative that he should himself come to Mecca with the Nejd pilgrimage, and discuss the various points at issue in your Maj esty&apos;s capital. His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious that you should be spared the fatigue of a voyage to Aden, and trust that you will agree to this proposal. They suggest that your Majesty should arrange for the Emir Abdullah to meet the Nejd pilgrimage at Taif and accompany Ibn Saud to Mecca, where they have little doubt that the two powerful friends of His Majesty&apos;s Government will come to a satisfactory agreement.
&quot;They propose, if yon see no objection, to arrange for a responsible Indian Moslem officer to accompany the Nejd pilgrims, and are confident that your Majesty will-adhere to tbe guarantee already given that the pilgrimage shall be re-opened and that you will restrain your people from any aggression. Ibn Saud for his part has given the required undertaking that the Nejd pilgrims will be placed in charge of a responsible official who will guarantee their good behaviour. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would also be grateful if your Majesty would permit them to assist you in arranging for the Nejd pilgrims to have every facility for purchasing supplies at Mecca for the return journey, as the quantities they are bringing are limited.Complaints against the Wahabis. Telegraphing on ISth and 20th June [Nos. 593 and 604], Lord Allenby reported that King Hussein had informed him that the Wahabis had (1) made a raid on the suburbs of Mecca ; (2) occupied two places on the Mecca-Medina road ; .and (3) attacked a village distant two hours from Taif, where they killed a sheriff and looted his property. He asked for 12 aeroplanes and the same number of motor cars.Quarantine Officials at Jeddah. On 20th June Lord Allenby reported [No. 603] that King Hussein had agreed to appoint a new Director-General of Quarantine, and that he assumed that His Majesty had agreed, by implication, to our control of the quarantine. Two days later he further reported [No. 612] that the new Director-General, Dr. Thabit, had reached Jeddah on 1 9th June, and had refused to work with the British quarantine officer, stating that he was acting under the direct orders of King Hussein. Lord Allenby added that he had explained to the King that we had done everything possible to come to a working arrangement, while keeping the essential aim in view. In a later telegram [No. 623] he said that he had telegraphed to the King mentioning Dr. Thabit&apos;s refusal to co-operate and hoping that an amicable arrangement would be reached. The King replied saying that his doctor was as good as the British medical officer.Proff erred Resignation of King Hussein. Telegraphing on 27th June [No. 623], Lord Allenby announced that, giving as his reasons the dispute in regard to the control of quarantine and our refusal to supply aeroplanes and armoured cars, King Hussein had once more tendered his resignation of the throne of the Hejaz and had asked that his successor should be appointed by 9th July. Lord Allenby had asked him to reconsider this decision, but the reply had been the reverse of conciliatory.The Hejaz Delegation and the Peace Treaty. On 23rd June Lord Curzon informed Lord Allenby [No. 561], General Bols at Jerusalem [No. 561], and Admiral Webb at -Constantinople [No. 570] that the Hejaz delegation had asked for the inclusion of the following clause in the Turkish Peace Treaty and requested their opinion thereon :  &quot; The Contracting Powers bind themselves on their side to respect and enforce respect of the &apos; Wakouf el Haramain,&apos; which are, or may be, founded in their territories for the benefit of the holy Cities of Islam, and to see that the revenues from these &apos; Wakoufs &apos;&apos; be handed over regularly to the Hejaz authorities to be devoted in conformity with, the wishes of the donors.&quot;ARGENTINA.Wheat Export Bill [F.C.R., xix., p. 2].  On 17th June Mr. Macleay telegraphed [No. 128] from Buenos Aires as follows : The lawyer whom I consulted has now confirmed in writing the opinion he expressed to me verbally.The text of the decree of 2nd June was published for the first time on 12th June in an unofficial Government paper simultaneously with the text of the second decree, dated 10th June, rescinding the first. Neither of these decrees has yet been published in the official gazette, although the text of the new law promulgated on 10th June has appeared in it.The question arises as to-whether British subjects, ships, and interests generally are bound by a decree which remained unpublished until after the date of its rescission, and of which it was not possible to obtain communication or a copy during its period of application.The Press cables of 15th June attribute to the Prime Minister, when replying to the parliamentary question, a statement that no vessel has been sent from Great Britain to Argentina for loading wheat since Sth April.
The Acting Wheat Commissioner and I are at a loss to understand this statement if it is accurately reported, as since 8th April over 23 vessels have been chartered by the Commission for loading cereals in Argentina.Telegraphing again on 21st June [No. 129] he said : -The present position is most unsatisfactory, and I beg immediate instructions.The law has had a contrary effect to that anticipated by the Argentine-Government, and the price of wheat has risen. Millers&apos; stocks being depleted, the Argentine Government are under the necessity of finding some 600,000 tons of wheat,, and, as they are reported to be threatened with serious disorders if they fail to cheapen the price of bread immediately, it is-to.be feared that they will at once commence to-expropriate wheat belonging to shippers and foreign Governments, starting on the stocks in port. In an attempt to reduce the present market price, this may also be accompanied by a prohibition of export.The Minister of Finance recently summoned a meeting of exporting firms, and gave them 48 hours in which to find a solution.In order to prevent, if possible, the Government from taking such hasty and inconsiderate, measures, the Italian Minister, the French Charge d&apos;Affaires, and I on 19th June suggested to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that our three Governments and the other Powers interested, being holders of practically all the stocks of wheat in the country, might assist the Argentine Government by ceding to them the 600,000 tons required on a pro raid basis at the ruling market price, as provided by law, and on a written guarantee that the balance of our purchases should be allowed to be shipped without hindrance, and licences to export only given to parties which have contributed to local requirements.The Minister for Foreign Affairs objected that at the present price the wheat would cost them $162,000,000, which was impossible. In order to reduce the price of bread, the Government could not pay more than $15. We then suggested that if wheat were to be ceded by us at a price less than the market value, the Argentine Government must make us some corresponding compensation by reduction of surtax.The Minister for Foreign Affairs agreed to submit this proposal to the Cabinet, and yesterday informed us that their counter-proposal was to purchase wheat from us for $17, to allow unrestricted exportation of all wheat remaining in the country, and to re-sell proportionately&apos; to His Maj esty&apos;s Government and other Governments at $17 the unused balance of the 600,000 tons which he estimated would be one-third of that quantity.   No reduction could be made in the surtax fixed by the new law.I said that I must refer this proposal to my Government.I pointed out that the average price of the wheat purchased by the  Royal , Commission and not yet shipped was $24, and that the new law provided for expropriating-priation at the current market price.The Minister for Foreign Affairs maintained that the present market price was inflated, and hinted that the Argentine Government would not accept it. His attitude led us to fear that they will use means to force the price down, if necessary, byprohibi-tion of export.The conclusion reached by the Acting Commissioner and myself is that, unless we voluntarily release our share of the 600,000 tons at $17, we shall be forced eventually to accept this price or even a lower one if the Government succeed, in depressing the market, and in addition we shall have to suffer a further period of prohibition.I questioned the right of the Argentine Government forcibly to expropriate wheat contracted to foreign Governments except under war conditions.The Minister for Foreign Affairs contended that they were fully justified in doing so, and I fear that the Argentine Government will avail themselves of the fact that practically the whole of our purchases are in the hands of exporters and not yet paid for.   I should be glad of your Lordship&apos;s ruling on this point.. On 25th June, wdth reference to his telegram of 21st June, he reported [No. 132] that the day before, at a meeting of the representatives of the Governments which had purchased Argentine wheat, it was decided that the Italian Minister and he himself should inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had pressed for a definite answer that evening, that inasmuch as the Argentine Government were not prepared to give Governments, who might be disposed voluntarily to surrender pro raid 600,000 tons of wheat at a price much less than the present market price or the average price of their purchases, any compensation (either in the way of reduction of the export surtax or in the form of special guarantees or privileges), with the
result that the Governments which made such an agreement would he in a worse position than a Government or a private purchaser who remained outside, it was not possible for us to make any ijroposals on behalf of our own or other interested Governments, so that we could only take our stand on the law of 10th June, and leave the&apos;Argentine Government to take such measures as they thought fit.We conveyed this message last night to the Minister for Foreign Affairs who said he could do nothing but submit it to his Government which had already lost valuable time and would now act at once. He again observed that the question of the manner of applying Article 3 of the new law, which provides for the expropriating-priation of wheat at the current market price, was one which rested with the Argentine Government, and hinted that our views and those of his Government as to what coustituted a real market price might be found to differ considerably.Our impression is that the Argentine Government, partly as a sop to the working-classes who are protesting against the continued export of wheat while the price of bread remains unchanged, and partly in the hope that it will lead to a fall in the price of wheat, intend to prohibit exportation.Experts consider that it is doubtful whether prohibition would have that effect, and as the Government would lose the benefits of the surtax it is not impossible that they may be obliged to come to us with new and more favourable proposals.On 25th June Lord Curzon instructed Mr. Macleay as follows [No. 67] :  1. You should approach the Argentine Government, recording in friendly but formal terms a protest against the levy of the wheat surtax on the shipment of purchases contracted prior to the surtax law. The effect of the law would be to impose a tax of over 2,250,000L on the wheat held by His Majesty&apos;s Government, audit might be pointed out that His Majesty&apos;s Government were recently able to give considerable assistance to the Argentine Government in connexion with the repayment of the Argentine debt in the United States, and they hope that in the circumstances the Argentine Government will feel able to exempt from the new duty wheat bought before 2nd June for shipment to the United Kingdom for the account of His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. For your information, if it proves impossible to secure exemption as above, you should endeavour to secure exemption for such shipments as would have been loaded before the passing of the Act on 10th June.3. In the meantime the Wheat Commission propose to pay the tax under protest, and the local Wheat Commission has been instructed to supply you at each shipment with a statement of the surtax paid and the date and the purchase price of the corre-sponding contract.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government share with that of the Argentine the liveliest concern at the high price wheat has reached in that country. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment point out, however, that this has immensely benefited Argentine production and industry at the expense of the foreign consumer. In order to reduce the cost of bread to the consumer in the United Kingdom, His Majesty&apos;s Government has resorted to subsidies which are wholly paid by the British taxpayer, and they cannot conceal the unfavourable impression that would be produced by an Argentine subsidy imposed on the foreign buyer either by a retrospective surtax on wheat, already purchased for export, or by expropriation at a price lower than that at which the foreign buyer has contracted to pay the Argentine seller.&quot;5. At the date of the embargo on the export of wheat, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment had outstanding purchases for shipment exceeding 500,000 tons, and 300,000 tons of shipping were already lying in Argentine waters for the purpose of lifting these purchases. 16. In order to assist the Argentine Government to retain in the country, and, if so desired, to acquire the wheat necessary for its home consumption, and to co-operate in lowering the market price of wheat in the Argentine, His Majesty&apos;s Government have suspended the shipment of the remaining 200.000 tons, and have, at very great cost and dislocation of ocean transport, diverted and withdrawn the tonnage already arranged for shipping that balance,7. His Majesty&apos;s Government will have pleasure in transferring to the Argentine Government, at cost price, their contracts for the above 200,000 tons, which is more than our proportion of the total quantity required by the Argentine Government,8. The representatives of the French and Italian Governments associated with the Wheat Commission have been informed of the contents of this message, and will communicate with their respective Governments.   Meantime you should communicate 17 5 B
them to your French and Italian colleagues, but you should not defer approaching the Argentine Government as above indicated until your colleagues have received instructions, as we desire a very prompt reply.AUSTRIA.The Boycott of Hungary. Telegraphing from Vienna [No. 274] on 19th June, Mr. Lindley said that the French Minister had called that afternoon to discuss the advisability of approaching the Austrian Government regarding the labour boycott, and they called together on the Marquis of Torretta who was leaving for Paris to-morrow. It was decided that it might do more harm than good to take any action during the ministerial crisis ; the State Chancellor was in no position to stop the boycott even if he wished to do it.The papers reported that the Hungarian Government had, as was to be expected, already- held up grain intended for Austria, in transit from Bulgaria and the S.H.S. State, and there could be little doubt that they would stop all Hungarian produce from entering Austria so long as the boycott lasted. He ventured to call Lord Curzoifs attention to the effects of the international committee at Amsterdam in Central European countries. Austrian workmen have instituted a boycott from which they would certainly be the chief sufferers. Nor was it a matter of indifference to His Majesty&apos;s Government, who were providing funds for feeding Vienna, that the nearest source of supply should be cut off owing to the labour organizations adopting Chinese methods.Anything he did or said in Vienna was sure to be misinterpreted as being done in support of the White Terror, but Lord Curzon might think it desirable to point out the deplorable general effect of such ill-considered action as the present.On 22nd June he reported [No. 277] that the boycott having been in force for two days, no telegraph, post or telephone communication was possible with Hungary.The non-social democrat employes of railways and other services were opposing the boycott, and one train had crossed the frontier the day before, The result had been a strike in the goods yard of the East Railway station. Passenger trains were still running, but the Society, in agreement with the Unions, threatened to stop them if there was any further opposition to the boycott. Measures had been taken to stop all goods traffic on the Danube for Hungary.The Government had adopted a passive attitude. The Hungarian reports stated that the boycott was only being carried on by Austria, and that traffic over Serbian, Czech and Roumanian frontiers was normal.As regards the Vienna Press, the Social-Democratic papers welcomed the boycott; the Christian Socialist organs denounced it in unmeasured terms; and such papers as the Neue Freie Press, while deploring its effects, hinted that &apos; the Hungarian Government had brought it upon themselves.And on the following day he further reported [No. 279] that as a result of the attitude of the non-Social-Demooratic employes, all railway7 traffic had been stopped at the Eastern station, except certain workmen s trains. There were, therefore, no direct passenger trains to Hungary7, and traffic with Brunn and Pressburg had also been stopped.It was reported that the Hungarian Government had stopped all traffic with Austria, and had ordered foodstuffs, in transit on the Danube, to be held up at Budapest.[See &apos;: Hungary.&quot;]The Government Crisis [F.C.R., xix., p. 4], Mr. Lindley7 telegraphed on 25th June [No. 282] as follows :-Three claj7s ago the Social-Democrats proposed that a neAv Government should be formed out of members chosen by the three main parties in the Assembly7 in accord-ance with their numerical strength. This proposal led to negotiations which seemed promising, but fell through yesterday because the parties were unable to agree as to the offices which were to be filled by their respective representatives. Last night all the Christian-Socialist Ministers of the late Government, which is still carrying on the affairs of State, resigned and their jfiaces were filled by the Social-Democrat Ministers taking over their offices in addition to the ones they already hold.The Government consists, therefore, of Social-Democrat Ministers and two officials who direct the Departments of Finance and Food. They have all resigned, and are only carrying on at the request of the President of the Assembly.
BALTIC STATES.The Dorpat Conference. Mr. Kidston reported from Helsingfors on 23rd June TNb. ? 518] that for some days past the Foreign Minister^ Press organ had hinted that if the Russians were granted economic or possibly territorial compensations they might give way on the Petchenga question ; according, however, to the official account of the proceedings, the Soviet delegates, who maintained that the retention of the old frontiers must be the basis of negotiations, had given a negative reply to the whole of Finland&apos;s territorial claims.Telegraphing again on 25th June [No. 515] he said that two days before, the Finnish armistice terms had been communicated to the Russians : The armistice,&apos; subject to a right to determine at two days&apos; notice, to be of indefinite duration ; the 1917. frontiers to be maintained ou the Gulf of Finland and in Ladoga; and Repola to be partly evacuated, otherwise the status quo on the frontier to be maintained.Aland Islands [F.C.R., xix., p. 5]. Mr. Barclay reported from Stockholm on 18th June [No. 186] that he had been asked to say that the Swedish Government had no objection to His Majesty&apos;s Government submitting the whole conflict to the League of Nations, but they regretted that they could not withdraw their appeal to the Peace Conference.And on 21st June Mr. Kidston reported from Helsingfors [No. 509] that he had explained the action of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Foreign Minister, who inquired whether it implied conviction of the justice of the Swedish claim. Mr. Kidston replied that His Majesty&apos;s Government had no preconceived ideas as to the merits of the conflicting claims.CHINA.Tibet [F.C.R. xvi., p. 5]. On 14th June Mr. Alston, telegraphing from Peking, transmitted [No. 290] the gist of a telegram sent by Mr. King. The latter said that Tibetan affairs would not take a back place as the frontier Commissioner had been ordered to act against Yunanv and was in consequence moving his troops from the frontier into Szechuan. This had been told him in confidence by the Commissioner himself.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.The Teschen Question [F.C.R., xix., p. 8]. On 19th June Sir George Clerk reported from Prague [No. 112] that the Minister for Foreign Afairs in making a statement regarding Teschen before the Committee on foreign affairs the day before had said that he had had informal discussions in Paris with Dr. Pilz and M. Patek, and that it had been agreed that the problem could only be settled in Prague and Warsaw and that the Foreign Ministers should meet again after obtaining final instructions from their respective Governments.He stated too that neither the Ambassadors&apos; Conference nor any of the allied Governments had tried to force Poland or Czecho-Slovakia&apos; into a decision unfavour-able to either State.Telegraphing from Paris on 18th June [No. 731] Sir George Grahame said that the United States Ambassador had notified the Conference of Ambassadors that the United States Government agreed to the proposal that the two Governments should be invited to settle the Teschen question by arbitration instead of by a plebiscite.[See Poland.]Resignation of M Prasek. On 23rd June Sir George Clerk telegraphed [No. 115] saying that M. Prasek, Agrarian Minister of Agriculture, had resigned and that he understood on good authority that the resignation would be accepted. The Govern-ment might thus be deprived of a large portion of the Agrarian vote and so have to reorganize the Cabinet.The Sokol Celebrations.- On 23rd June Lord Curzon instructed Sir George Clerk [No. 106] to convey the following message from him to the representatives of the City of London who, he said, should read it out at the Sokol celebrations : On the occasion of the Sokol celebrations at Prague I desire on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government to convey to the Government, and through them to the people, -of Czecho-Slovakia an expression of sincere congratulation and goodwill.
The British people have for long admired in the person of your honoured President the high efforts and ideals of the Czecho-Slovak nation, and we join with you to-day in welcoming the achievement of these ideals and the firm foundation of your future prosperity.DENMARK.   .Incorporation of Northern Schleswig. On 27th June Sir Charles Marling reported [No. - 610] that as the Danish Parliament held its last sitting, prior to the general election, on 26th June a hill was then passed for the incorporation of northern Schleswig in Denmark. The King, however, would not sign the bill until the treaty under which the Allies handed over the sovereignty to Denmark had come into force. In this manner it was hoped that the reunion would take place without further action on the part of the Danish Legislature.The&apos; International Clearing House, Limited.  On 19th June Sir Charles Marling reported from Copenhagen [No. 601] that the Danish Committee for the resumption of trade relations with Russia stated that gold having been received from that country and deposited in the Danish National Bank, the International Clearing House, Limited, had been established with a capital of 2,000,000 crowns subscribed in Denmark and Great Britain.GERMANY.New Cabinet. On 25th June Lord Kilmarnock reported [No. 371] that it had been officially announced that the Cabinet had been constructed as follows :  Chancellor        - -             -             - Herr Fehrenbach.Foreign Affairs -             -             - Herr Simons.Interior            - -            -            - Herr Koch.Finance - -             -             -.- Herr Wirth.Food               - -            -            - Herr Hermes.Posts     - -             -             -          - Herr Giesberts.Communications ... General Groener.Defence - -             -             -          - Herr Geszler.Economics        - -             -             - Herr Scholy.Treasury -             -             -          - Herr von Rainier.The following wireless messages were taken in from Nauen on 24th June : Bavaria and the German Reich. In the National Committee (Landesvorstand) of the German People&apos;s Party, the Chairman of the party, Held, stated.that expression was constantly being given to the feeling that Bavaria should be the point from which the, restoration of the Reich should start. He knew nothing of efforts to break Bavaria off from the Reich and he held the view that the demolition of the Reich would he a misfortune.ludendorff&apos;s Attitude&apos; towards Bolshevism. At the request of several Entente journalists, who, through intermediaries asked Ludendorff for a statement as to the military situation in Russia, the general replied, according to the Bavarian Stantszeitung, in a letter, from which it can be gathered that Ludendorff considers Bolshevism as a great European clanger, and is ready to take common action with the Entente against it. The tenor of this letter is in sharp contrast with the forged letter attributed to Ludendorff and published in the Paris Eclair as to a war of Red -armies against France.HUNGARY.The Proposed Boycott. On 18th June Mr. Johnson telegraphed from Budapest [No. 378] saying that he and his Italian and French colleagues had decided to call the attention of their respective Governments to the anxiety caused by the decree of the Labour Conference at Amsterdam that Hungary should be boycotted.Telegraphing again two days later [No. 383] he said that as a result of a Cabinet Council an official communique had been published in the Press stating that the Hungarian Government reserved to themselves the right to have recourse to reprisals-
against any States which might put the &quot; blockade &quot; into force. The official view was that the proposed boycott was an attempt of the Amsterdam labour extremists to establish a precedent, by taking advantage of the weakness of the Government of Vienna and of the so-called White Terror in Hungary, so that it might be possible at a later date to declare a similar boycott on any of the Great Powers.On 21st June he reported [No. 385] that the telegraph authorities had informed him that morning that they were unable to forward telegrams to Vienna, Belgrade or Bucharest, and that telegrams to London and Paris were sent only on condition that no responsibility should be accepted for safe delivery.Later in the clay, in company with his French colleague, he had called on the Secretary-General, who informed them that the Foreign Minister would give an order that all telegrams should be accepted, but no responsibility taken for their reaching their destination.Next clay he further reported [No. 386] that the Foreign Minister had informed him that the blockade of Hungary was complete on the Austrian frontier ; there were no through trains, but passengers were allowed to change trains at the frontier with portable luggage. The Hungarian Government had given orders to institute retaliatory measures.There was no blockade on the Serb-Croat-Slovene or Czecho-Slovak frontier, and the Rumanian frontier was normal.[See &quot; Austria.&quot;]ITALY.New Ministry. On 16th June Sii list of the new Cabinet as follows : President of Council and InteriorColoniesFinanceLiberated TerritoriesPublic WorksJustice     -Industry   -Posts and TelegraphsTreasuryAgricultureWar        - -  .Labour    -Foreign AffairsMarine    -EducationGeorge Buchanan telegraphed [No. 219] theSignor Giolitti.Signor Rossi.Signor Tedesco.Signor Raineri.Signor Peano.Signor Fera.Sigouri Alessio. -Signor Pascpualino Vassallo.Signor Meda.Signor Micheli.Signor BonomiSignor Labriola.Signore Sforza.Signor Sechi.Signor Croce.Mutiny at Aneona. On 27th June Sir George Buchanan reported [No. 271] that the day before at dawn the battalion of Bersaglieri at Ancona had mutinied on receiving instructions to embark for Albania. Previous to the outbreak 100 Anarchists succeeded in entering the barracks. The barracks were surrounded by police, on whom the mutineers opened fire with rifles and machine-guns. Simultaneously an anarchist rising occurred on the railway, accompanied by a general strike, proving-that the outbreak was pre-arranged. The people of the town appeared to have been in general sympathy with the mutineers. The mutiny was clue to the extreme unpopularity of the operations in Albania, to intense anarchist propaganda at Ancona, and possibly to the dissatisfaction of the Bersaglieri at the great reduction of their corps. The barracks were surrounded by loyal troops, who employed artillery, and in the afternoon the mutineers surrendered.Fiume. On 24th June Sir George Buchanan reported [No. 268] that the President of the Council had said in regard to Fiume that he hoped time would bring some satisfactory solution of the question, but he did not think it seemly for Italy to be constantly making offers to the Jugo-Slavs. He said, too, that he had no intention oi taking any action without the consent of the Allied Powers. As for L&apos;Annunzio, he was in no way responsible for his presence at Fiume, and he had no wish whatsoever to treat with him for the withdrawal of his troops and the substitution of an Italian force.17-5 C
MEXICO.The Provisional Presidents Policy. Mr. Cummins reported [No. 161] that in the course of a long conversation with the Provisional President, in regard to internal problems and international relations, the latter had stated that he should seek opportunities to show his goodwill towards British interests, adding that as a consider-able portion of the archives of the late Government had been lost, he should like the Foreign Ministry to be privately furnished with a list of the properties still withheld from British owners. Mr. Cummins said that the friendliness of the new Government might be accepted without question as genuine.MONTENEGRO.Evacuation by Italian Troops. On 22nd June Sir Alban Young reported [No. 185] that it was announced by the Press Bureau that the Italian troops had evacuated Bar (Antivari), Dulcigno and all the Montenegrin littoral, and that the evacuated territory had been immediately occupied by Serb-Croat-Slovene forces. The Italian troops have thus definitely quitted Montenegrin territory, where there are now no foreign troops.NORWAY.New Cabinet. On 16th June Sir Mansfeldt Findlay reported [No. 128] the resignation of the Government after defeat in Parliament, and on 19th June he telegraphed [No. 130] that a new Conservative Government had been formed as follows : Prime Minister and Minister of Justice-   Mr.    Otto    B.

A. Jahren (landowner, Smaalene).PERSIA.The Shah and his Prime Minister [F.C.R., xix., p. 12].  On 25th June, Mr. Norman reported [No. 422] that the Shah had accepted the resignation of Vossuk-ecl-Dowleh, and had sent for Mushir-ed-Dowleh that morning. In reference to this, Mr. Norman, telegraphing [No. 427] the following day, said it was the general opinion that the continuance in power of the late Cabinet constituted a grave danger, and that Mushir-ed-Dowleh was the best man available for the task of forming a new government.POLAND.Neio Cabinet. On 24th June Sir Horace Rumbold reported [No. 430] that a Cabinet had been formed by M. Ladislas Grabski who remained Minister of Finance. General Schllesniewski remained Minister of War, and there would be no changes at the Ministries of Food, Railways, Industry and Commerce; Prince Sapieha, the Polish Minister in London, had been offered the post of Minister for. Foreign Affairs, and it was believed that he would accept. M. Wojciechowski, Minister of Interior in the last two Cabinets, would not be in&apos;the new one. The new Government would be in the main Government experts, and would be supported by the Conservative and Moderate parties. The Peasant, the Socialist and the National Workmen&apos;s parties and the rest of the Left world be in opposition. Their tactics would depend on the policy of the new Government.
The Teschen Question. On 22nd June Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 426] that M. Patek had given him the following account of his negotiations with M. Benes -at Paris in regard to tbe Teschen question : He first proposed that aR the districts in the Teschen plebiscite area which contained 80 per cent. Czechs or Poles, as the case might be, should be recognised by the respective Governments as belonging to Czecho-Slovakia or Poland, the remaining districts being subject to arbitration or a plebiscite. M. Benes declined this proposal. At M. PatelCs request M. Benes then prepared a line of partition, but as this line assigned all the coal areas to the Czechs M. Patek would not agree to it. M. Benes then proposed arbitration after ascertaining by telephone from Prague that the President, the Prime Minister and one other influential Minister were agreeable to that course. But he informed M. Patek that he was not definitely authorized to make a formal proposal to submit the Teschen question to arbitration.It was finally agreed that after M. Benes had ascertained the views of the Czecho-Slovak Government- he should telegraph to M. Patek and propose a meeting between the two either at Oppeln, if it were decided to make a further attempt to settle the Teschen question by direct agreement between two parties,&apos;or else at Paris if the matter was to be referred to arbitration. Although M. Benes had promised to tele-graph M. Patek on 20th June, he had heard nothing further from him.[See &quot; Czecho-Slo slovakia.&apos;&apos;]Poland, and Danzig. A. wireless message from Nauen, dated 2Sth June, states the following : The Polish draft Treaty submitted to the Danzig Diet relates to the future political relations of Danzig Avith Poland. If the draft is accepted by Danzig, the toAvn will become in fact Polish. Poland, in accordance Avith the Peace Treaty, claims the exclusive right of representing Danzig abroad, but also insists on the control of the Courts of Justice and schools by Polish authorities, the right of carrying out a military occupation of Danzig and her harbour, as avell as the monopoly of building men-of-war and merchant Aressels. Poland even demands the right of sanctioning the establishment of commercial and emigration comnanies.PORTUGAL.New Government. On 27th June Sir Lancelot Carnegie reported [No. 67] that a neAv Ministry, composed of Extreme-Democrats, Socialists, and Independents, had been formed by Senhor A. M. de Silva, leader of the first-named party. There had, he said, been hopes that a moderate or even Conservative Government might haA^e been constituted and disappointment was general. It Avas improbable that the new-Ministry would last long as it would find little support in Parliament.RUMANIA.Germany and the Railways. Telegraphing from Bucharest on 14th June [No. 293] Mr. Rattigan reported that a poAverful section of the Government was evidently Avorkiug Avith the Bratianists (who had opened a violent anti-British campaign), and probably the Italian Minister, to giA^e a German orientation to Rumanian policy, and he Avas warning both the King and the Prime Minister of the dangers of such a policy. . The head of this section of the Government Avas M. Argetoyano, the Minister of the Interior. Mr. Rattigan added that he had learnt from a reliable source that an unconditional offer to reorganize the Rumanian, railways had been made by the Germans. xRUSSIA.Bolshevik Gold. Mr, Leslie reported from Reval on 17th June [unnumbered] that he had receiAred information that an agent of the French Government, acting in close touch Avith a French Consul, had given instructions for the purchase of large quantities of Bolshevik gold roubles, no maximum being specified. They offered 60 francs per 10 roubles and Avere prepared . to go higher. He had pressed his informant, a reliable man, as to this agent&apos;s connexion with the French GoA^ernment, -and had been told that it was patent.
Fifty million roubles have already been . shipped to Sweden in payment largely for paper and Swedish stocks of American leather and (group undecypherable) elsewhere. At present the Bolsheviks asked about 21 Swedish crowns for 10 roubles.General Wrangel and the Crimea. The following note appears in the Weekly-Appreciation of Matters of Naval Interest7 for 19th June [No. 79] :-The Commander-in-Chief, Mediteranean, reports that General Wrangel in his-recent operations has acquired territory from which he can feed the Crimean population. He considers that the retention of this area and the maintenance of the moral in the rear will be gravely affected by the withdrawal of naval support and of the Mission. Although it is understood that His Maj esty&apos;s Government decided on this withdrawal of support due to Wrangel taking the offensive, the Commander-in-Chief points out that Wrangehs action was necessary in order to forestall the Red offensive, which, it is confirmed, Avas to have taken place 48 hours later. Had Wrangel not attacked, the Crimea would have starved. In any case the former does not propose to advance beyond the Alexandrovsk-Melitopol line. Great quantities of grain are reported captured. General Wrangel, through the Military Mission, implores His Majesty&apos;s Government to be on its guard against the unt-rustworthiness of the Bolshevik negotiations. In any armistice negotiations he emphasised the following conditions : (1) His Majesty&apos;s Government to conduct the negotiations as he cannot meet the Soviet delegates.(2) The retention of territory at Melitopol in order to feed his people. (3) Effective guarantees against a Bolshevik attack. (4) Continued British support if the Bolsheviks break the armistice. (5) British Naval support.Siberia.People&apos;s Parliament. On 15th June Mr. Preston telegraphed from Vladivostock [No. 47] saying that two days before the elections had commenced for the temporary Priamur People&apos;s Parliament, which was to be opened at Vladivostock on 17th June. The Vlaclivostock town polls had returned 20 Left Socialists (with a predominance of Bolsheviks) out of a total of 25. The new parliament was to be a legislative body of the Far East, although the temporary Government had reserved the right to legislate in the event of an interruption of a session of Parliament and had already appointed an Executive which included three Bolshevik and two Socialist Ministers. The Socialist success was largely attributed to the apathetic attitude  if the bourgeoisie and the new financial reform.SERBIA.The Spa Conference. On 22nd June Sir Alban Young telegraphed [No. 183] that he had received the following urgent memorandum from the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government with a request from the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that he should communicate it to His Majesty&apos;s Government without delay : The Conference at which representatives of the Allied States and representatives of Germany will participate at Spa, as also the preliminary conversations, have attracted the serious attention of the Royal Government seeing that questions will be discussed which have a vital interest for the Serb-Croat-Slovene State, questions con-cerning the indemnities which Germany and other enemy countries have engaged themselves to pay. The Royal Government take a very great interest in this question because the economic future of the State is intimately connected with the damage suffered by Serbia, devastated and ruined by an enemy occupation of three years&apos; duration.The Royal Government desire to take part in the discussions in order to be afforded the possibility of defending direct those vital interests which are guaranteed to-this State in the first instance by the Treaty of Versailles.As the right is clearly accorded by the Treaty of Versailles to this State to take part in the discussion of these questions it appears impossible that such a discussion could have a valid result without its participation and- consent.Consequently the Ministry for Foreign Affairs begs His Majesty&apos;s Legation to draw the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the above facts in order that this
SYRIA.Emir Feisal and the Armistice with Mustapha Kemal. Cn 19th June Lord Allenby transmitted [No. 599] a message for Lord Curzon from the Emir Feisal, and on 23rd June [No. 616] the substance of twro letters from the Emir to himself. In these documents he showed himself to be greatly perturbed by the armistice between the French and the Turks under Mustapha Kemal, the news of which, he said, had come on his people like a thunderbolt and had greatly damaged his prestige. In consequence he had been obliged to banish a number of people who had shown them-selves sympathetic to the Turks, and to suppress several local newspapers. The armistice had made him suspicious of the 6077a fides of the French, and he wished to receive instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government as to his duty in regard to the French zone, to Mesopotamia, and to Syria in general before he went to Paris.TURKEY.Apology for the Atta.ck on British Troops at Ismid. On 24th June Admiral de Robeck reported [No. 738] that the Turkish Government had conveyed through the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in the absence of the Foreign Minister, a formal expression of regret for the attack on British troops at Ismid hy insurgents who were not under the control of the Government.Situation in Konia. Telegraphing on 25th June [No. 747], Admiral de Robeck said that he had received information to the effect that there was a very anti-Christian feeling in this place, and that the Greeks and Armenians were held responsible for the misfortunes of the Turks ; the streets were in conseq-uence placarded with posters advocating their massacre. The American Relief Committee in Constantinople had telegraphed to its staff in Konia authorizing them to withdraw, and Miss Cushman, -one of the relief workers, had replied that she had charge of 600 Armenian orphans, and meant to take her chance with them.Situation in cilicia. On 25th June Admiral cle Robeck reported [No. 747] that the news from Cilicia continued to be disquieting. An American missionary who had been at Adana so recently as 13th June described the situation as being very critical and said that a general Nationalist attack was expected at Adalia and other places. He said too that the French appeared to be goading on both Turks and Armenians, the relations between whom was becoming increasingly hostile, though it was said that the leaders on both sides were trying to restrain their followers. In the immediate neighbourhood of Aclana the field labourers were being kidnapped or killed, and in consequence, food prices were rising as the harvest was not being-got in.17-5 DState may also be invited to Spa, and to any preliminary conversations which may take place for this Conference between the representatives of the Allied Governments.In reply to the foregoing the following instructions were telegraphed [No. 130] from the Foreign Office to Sir Alban on 29th June&apos;:- You should, if a reply is required, say that His Majesty&apos;s Government do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by inviting the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government to participate in the Conference. -Should any question directly affecting them come up for discussion, it would of course be in the power of the Supreme Council to summon a Serb-Croat-Slovene representative to attend.SWEDEN.Visit of the British Fleet. In a despatch dated 14th June [No. 477], Mr. Barclay said that the visit of the British fleet, under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Roger Keyes, had been a great success. The King had on several occasions expressed, both to Sir Roger and himself, his high appreciation and his admiration for the vessels : when on board the flagship, His Majesty&apos;s flag as a British Admiral was flown. Mr. Barclay added that he had also learnt that the visit had had an excellent effect &quot;in banking and commercial circles.
UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.Mr. Chamberlains Letter to Mr. Rathbone. On 18th June Sir Auckland Geddes transmitted [No. 459] the following note from the United States Government: 1. The Secretary of the Treasury has received a letter addressed to the Assistant Secretary, Mr. Rathboue, hy the Chancellor of the Exchequer under date 21st May 1920, and has consulted with the President in regard to the same.2. It has been at all times the view of the United States Treasttry that questions regarding the indebtedness of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to the United States Government, and the funding of such indebtedness, had no relation either to questions arising concerning the war loans of the United States and of the United Kingdom to other Governments or to questions regarding the reparation payments of the Central Powers of Europe. These views, were expressed to representatives of the British Treasury constantly during the period when the United States Government was makingloans to the Government of the United Kingdom and since that time in Washington, in Paris, and in London. The views of the President on the subject were stated at length to the Prime Minister in a letter dated 5th May 1919. &quot;3. While at the outset of Mr. Rathbone s discussions with Mr. Blackett of the British Treasury during the latter part of the year 1919 and the beginning of 1920 in Paris and London, it was thought that the arrangements being discussed for the funding of the obligations of the United Kingdom held by the United States might form a basis of arrangements thereafter to be made with other debtor Governments by the United States and the British Treasuries respectively, later Mr. Blackett made it plain that tbe British Treasury proposed to make other and different arrangements as to the obligations it held of the Allied Governments and thereafter discussions in London between Mr. Blackett and Mr. Rathbone proceeded on that basis.4. While the Secretary of the Treasury has felt some surprise that Mr. Rathbone s negotiations in London, undertaken there at the suggestion of the British treasury, have been interrupted, he desires, to express his regret that if he does not himself feel able to continue the same, Congress has however delegated to the Secretary of the treasury the sole authority to deal with these matters, and the Secretary suggests that a representative of the Government of the United Kingdom who has the neces-sary authority to negotiate with him in fulfilment of the obligation of the Government of the United Kingdom to convert their demand obligations held by the United States Treasury into long term obligations shall proceed to Washington for the purpose.5. In his letter of 18th May 1920 to the Chancellor, Mr. Rathbone advised that he had theretofore explained to Mr. Rathbone (sic) the legal situation which made it necessary that the pajnnent of accrued interest on the demand obligations of the British Government held by the United States treasury should be asked, unless postponed in accordance with the terms of long time obligations in such a form as might be agreed upon, and which the Government of the United Kingdom would agree to deliver in exchange for such demand obligations upon the request of the Secretary of the Treasury. Accordingly, the Secretary of the treasury expresses his hopes that the interrupted negotiations for the funding of the demand obligations of the Government of the United Kingdom may be resumed at the earliest possible date.6. In Mr. Blackett&apos;s letter of 1st June 1920, to Mr. Rathbone, he suggested the immediate settlement of the various questions discussed in London with which the British treasury is competent to deal, thus leaving a clear field for further discussion of long term bonds. The Secretary of the treasury does not feel able to release the Government of the United Kingdom from its obligations of 16th April, the so-called subrogated securities, except in connexion with an agreement regarding longer term bonds ; otherwise he is prepared to meet the&apos;suggestion made by the British treasury, and to agree with it regarding the Pittman Act silver advances and dollar reimbursement questions, in accordance with the text of the memoranda on. these subjects which Mr. Rathbone handed to Mr. Blackett in London as a result of their discussions. If these matters are thus arranged, the Secretary of the treasury is on his part prepared, in order to comply with the wishes of the British Treasury, to enter into the following agreement regarding United States advances to the United Kingdom for Austrian relief: Of the demand obligations of the Government of the United Kingdom held by the United States Government, obligations aggregating 16,000,000 dollars duplicate amount, represent advances to the United Kingdom for its purchases of foodstuffs in the United States subsequently sold by the United Kingdom   to Austria,  all ih
pursuance of arrangements for the relief of Austria made by or on behalf of the Unitect States Government, the Government of the United Kingdom and other Governments. It is understood that the British Treasury will pay forthwith the principal of the said demand obligations held by the United States Government in the amount of 16,000,000 dollars, together with the interest accrued thereon at the rate of 5 per cent, to the date of payment, as to 8,000,000 dollars thereof from 15th April 1919, and as to the remaining 8,000,000 dollars from 15th May 1919 ; but such payments shall in no way release the Government of the United Kingdom from its undertaking to sell to Austria foodstuffs purchased in the United States to the value of 16,000,000 dollars as provided in the arrangements for the relief of Austria hereinbefore referred to.The Irish Question. Sir A. Geddes telegraphed [No. 481] on 25th June that he believed himself to be in a position to deny that Colonel House was in any way representative of President Wilson&apos;s views on the subject of the Irish settlement. There appeared to have been a complete rupture between Colonel House and the President, and it was clear, at all events, that the former was in no way entitled to speak for the democratic party. In the south, which is solidly democratic, the sentiment is pro-British and anti-Irish, and the best of the Southerners&apos; are not pleased .at the comparison between LincohPs declaration on the subject of maintaining the the Union and the present Irish situation, recently made by the Prime Minister.British Policy in regard to Russia. On 20th June Sir Auckland Geddes telegraphed [No. 465] as follows : I spoke to the Secretary of State and the Assistant Secretary of State, who again raised the general question of British policy with regard to Russia, The Secretary of State reiterated his belief that the Government of Lenin was nearing its fall, and said that the United States Government viewed, in the light of its present information, with some concern the present discussions proceeding in London between the Prime Minister and M. Krassin with a view to opening up trade with Russia. He said the policy of the United States Government not to permit trade with Russia was not an immutable policy ; that if they were convinced that the principles underlying the British policy were sound they would follow the same lines, but he was very fearful that the opening of trade (? this year) by the United States would mean supplying Russia with, locomotives, rolling-stock, and railway equipment, and, though not technically so, in effect weapons of war. He felt that the provision of such things to the Bolshevik Government might add seriously to the difficulties of the British Government in dealing with the spread of Bolshevik activities southward and eastward. He expressed a hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government would keep him fully informed as to the progress of the negotiations, and said that he felt that the United States Ambassador in London was not fully in touch with what was going on. He urged that the greatest frankness should be adopted, and that the discussions between His Maj esty&apos;s Government and the United States Government should be as full and as free as possible on this matter.I reiterated what I had said in a previous conversation as to the lines of British policy, and said that, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government as I understood.it, the greatest and most important reason for resuming trade with Russia was to make available grain, which existed or could be produced in Russia, to help meet the needs of Europe.I reminded the Secretary of State that the position of American food production was such that no Government would be justified in leaving closed from access any store of grain which might exist anywhere in the world if it were possible to open a way of access to that grain without infringement of any vital moral principle.In conclusion, the Secretary of State told me that he believed the opinion of practically all Americans was opposed to any traffic with the Soviet Government, and cited the decision of the American Federation of Labour in favour of this contention.
