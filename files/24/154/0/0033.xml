FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.The Amir -proposed as Caliph. On 11th December the Viceroy of India tele-graphed [1416 s.] information to the effect that at the Jumma Masjid, Kabul, on 19th November, an address had been delivered suggesting that the Amir, who was the only independent Musahnan ruler remaining, should, as the head of Islam, be recognized as Caliph by the Musalman world.In a telegram [No. 221 j dated 16th December the Viceroy said that according to reports from Kabul, although the Amir had repudiated the suggestion that he should adopt the title of Caliph, it was evident that he would like to do so, and he was permitting the Kabul mullahs to ascribe that title to him by way of testing public opinion.Jemal Pashas Mission [F.C.R., xxxii, p. 2].-In his telegram of 11th December the Viceroy reported that at a fully attended darbar held on 23rd November, at which Jemal Pasha was present, the Amir prohibited the issue of a pamphlet on the caliphate question, with the remark that he had no intention of taking part in intrigues against the British Government which would contribute to the downfall of Afghanistan.In his telegram of 16th December, the Viceroy stated that members of Jemal Pashas mission had been reported as having arrived in Kandahar en route for Herat. The reports up to 3rd December announced that Jemal himself had not left Kabul by that date.Internal Affairs.- Tbe A&quot;iceroy also recorded that an announcement had been made in Kandahar by Abdul Aziz, personal assistant to the Amir, that he had instructions to raise seven new battalions from the Durani tribes. According to the Viceroy&apos;s information, this was in consequence of the proposed reorganization of the army on a tribal basis, and not clue to any intention to increase it. It was reported that the Durani sardars were offering strong opposition to finding the recruits.ARABIA.Message from King Hussein. The following message to Lord Curzon v as. sent from Mecca by King Hussein on 22nd December : We will be obliged if your Excellency will hasten in making Ibn Saud return to his old boundaries as it was before the war, and since long during his fatheFs and uncle s and my granclfatheFs and uncle&apos;s. I trust that your Excellency may send us the financial subsidy, as the subsidy has nothing to do with international politics, which are established on the basis of our agreement with Great Britain.Emir VeisaVs Mission. On 20th December the British agent at Jeddah [No. 423] reported some of the contents of a telegram from King Hussein to the Emir Feisal containing instructions regarding bis-mission to London. Provided that complete independence was assured, beyond a shadow of doubt, and that the boundaries were not affected, Emir Feisal was authorized to open discussions with His Majesty&apos;s Government on the original agreements and, subject to the above conditions, to &apos; consider British interests and advantages.AUSTRIA.Appeal to the Reparation Commission. The following telegram [No. 443] was sent by Mr. Lindley from Vienna on 24th December :  The Federal Government and the Austro-Hungarian Bank are appealing to the Reparation Commission in Paris against a demand by the liquidators for the surrender of all assets, including foreign holdings and metal reserve, with a threat in the case of refusal to remove the officials.
T liave already pointed out the possible damage to British creditors if the claims of the liquidators to exclude the disposal of the assets are sustained, and I am con-vinced that the suspension of the hank at this stage would precipitate a grave financial and political crisis. I trust, therefore, that the British delegates will he instructed to see that no action is taken by the liquidators until the position of the hank has been considered hy the conference of interested parties, which I understand the commission is summoning.The liquidators uo doubt realise that the whole financial situation here is exceedingly critical, and. that it is of the first importance that the machinery of finance -should not be destroyed.   The continued existence of this machinery offers -the only means of averting a catastrophe.CHILE.New President and Cabinet. ReuteFs agent sent the following telegram from Santiago cle Chile on 23rd December: At a plenary sitting of Congress to-day the presidential mandate for the period 1920 to 1925 was formally entrusted to Senor Arturo Alessandri.The new Cabinet has been constituted as follows : Premier and Minister for the Interior Senor Pedro Aguirre.Foreign Affairs        - Sehor Jorge Matteo.Finance        - - 1 - - Sehor Daniel Martner.Justice        - - - - Senor Armando Jarainillo.Industry and Labour - - Senor Zenon Torrealba.War and Marine      - - - Senor Silva Cruz.CHINA.Relations with the Far-Eastern Republic. The following wireless message was despatched from Moscow on 17th December : The Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed M. Yurik, Ambassador of the Republic of the Far East, that China has decided to commence negotiations with the Republic with regard to the resumption of trade relations. Negotiations between the Republic of the Far East and Japan began in Vladivostock on 7 th December.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.Food Shortage. Telegraphing from Prague on 28th December [No. 190], Sir George Clark reported that he had that day been informed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs that the Government was sending the Minister of Commerce to Holland, Belgium, and London, to make an endeavour to obtain sufficient grain to supply the country till June, when the early Serbian harvest would become available. They were in fact threatened with a serious food shortage during the latter half of next March and the two following months. There had, he said, been no lack of foresight ; the shortage was clue to the fact that, on account of the collapse of the railway traffic and the condition of the river, the large Government stocks on the Danube and in Rumania could not be mewed. Sir George added that he ventured to submit that help by His Majesty&apos;s Government would be to the general interest, if it were in any way possible, as a food crisis in the spring would enable the Communists to recover from the severe defeat which had just been inflicted on them by the Government, He gathered that the Minister of Commerce, M. Hotowetz, would, offer a suggestion of timber, &amp;c, in exchange for grain.DENMARK.The Slesvig Treaty. On .15th December Lord Hardinge reported from Paris &quot;;[No. 1393] that the ratifications of the Slesvig treaty, signed on 5th July, had been deposited that clay by the British Empire, Italy, France, Japan, and Denmark, and that the usual proces-verbal of the ratification had also been signed whereby the treaty had been brought into force.-    23-5 - A 2t
GERMANY.Likelihood of Trouble. On 29th December Mr.  Robertson   telegraphed from Coblentz [No. 185] as follows :  , While not wishing to be alarmist, I think that I should warn your Lordship that information at my disposal here tends to show that there is a&quot; likelihood of serious trouble throughout Germany within the next few weeks. The railway officials are now voting for or against a strike. They are inadequately paid, but their demands would, I believe, add two and a half milliard marks to the railway-deficit. The German Government intend to stand firm, and a strike appears inevitable. It wdll probably be followed by va post and telegraph strike, and possibly be accompanied by a strike of the workmen on railways, who hope to-have the support of the officials for demands of their own later on.The extremists of both sides are likely to take advantage of the situation, and I have reason to believe that they have made all preparations.We have only 15 days&apos; coal supply on the railways here, and the situation may become precarious for the armies.GREECE.Resignation of the Ministry. On 27th December Lord Granville telegraphed [No. 356] that the Government had tendered its resignation. This was a formal measure, and King Constantine had asked them to retain office tiR the meeting of the Chamber. What the relative strength of the groups would then be was uncertain. M. Rhallys could not be said to have a party ; he became President of the Council as a moderate man under whom others could serve. He, Lord Granville, believed the claim of the Venizelists to be the strongest homogeneous party to be true, and that probably the Gounarists were the next strongest. The followers of Stratos closely followed the Gounarists in point of numbers. Whatever-Government might;be formed, Lord Granville thought that everything possible would be done, to secure the friendship of the Allies, and more particularly that of ourselves.HUNGARY.New Ministry. Mr. Hohler reported from Budapest [No. 597] on 17th December that Count Teleki had succeeded in forming a Ministry and that he and his Ministers had taken the oath before the Governor the night before. Count Teleki was provisionally Minister for Foreign Affairs; Dr. Hogedus, Minister of Finance ; Dr. Hegyeshalmy, Minister of Commerce ; M. Szabo, Minister of Agriculture&apos;; aud General Belicska, Minister of War. M. Rubinek and Dr. Haller were not in the Cabinet.ITALY.Ultimatum to D&apos;Annunzio: Sir George  Buchanan  telegraphed  from  Rome [No. 544] as follows on 21st December : The Italian Government have sent an ultimatum to D&apos;Annunzio, expiring at 6 p.m. to-day, through General calviglia in the following sense :-(1) To evacuate at once Arbe and Veglia and any other territory not assigned by the Treaty of Rapallo to the State of Fiume.(2) To allow free exit to Italian ships now in the port of Fiume and to give-up at once the vessels and armoured cars which have gone over to him since the declaration of blockade.(3) To disband and remove armed forces not consisting of citizens of Flume.Only discussion of the manner in which these conditions can be carried out will rje permitted.The official communique this evening adds that, if the reply is not satisfactory,. General calviglia will proclaim the effective blockade of Fiume, Veglia, Arbe and San Marco, which will differ from that proclaimed on 1st December in that no-exchange of commodities will be permitted and the blockaded area will be completely isolated.
JAPAN.Relations with the Vladivostock- Government. Telegraphing from Tokio on 16th December, Sir Charles Eliot reported [No. 469] that the Minister of Foreign Affairs did not regard the Vladivostock Government as wholly subject to that of Chita, and still hoped that Japan would be able to work with it. At the same time he expressed anxiety in regard to the position.See also under &quot;Siberia.&quot;POLAND.The Socialist Party. On 20th December Sir Percv Loraine telegraphed [No. 1131] as follows :-The Polish Socialist party, referring to its resolution of 25th October, point out that the grounds on which the Coalition Government was originally formed have disappeared, and that in order to have a clear programme and a single line of conduct, different conditions, political, social, and economic, are necessary, but cannot be attained with the present Cabinet, which still includes representatives of the economic and political reaction. The policy of a Government in which the traces of reactionary influence still iind expression cannot give the reepuisite support to the interests of the working classes or satisfy the present needs of the country. The Socialist members of the Government are therefore to be withdrawn. This involves the resignation of M. Daszynski, Vice President of the Council, and thereby the total secession of the Socialists from the Coalition Government. According to the press, the Socialist party made its continued participation in the Government conditional on the grant of three portfolios, including that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs ; this condition has presumably been rejected.RUMANIA.Rumania and Russia.-The following is the translation of a wireless message, as intercepted, from M. Chicherin to M. Take Jonescu, Foreign Minister at Bucharest, dated from Nikolaieff, 25th December : I regret that the difficulty of radio-telegraphic communication between us and Rumania has been the cause of the deplorable delay in our reply to your radios of 12th and 16th December, a delay which we regret all the more because the mis-understanding as to the presence of our troops in the Dniester region should, in the mutual interest of our two countries, be dissipated at once. I can assure you that the only reason for the stay of our troops in that locality is that the winter quarters, to which they have just, gone back, happen to be situated there. For climatic reasons, and for reasons of a technical kind, the winter quarters of part of our troops happen to be distributed in the south-west part of the Ukraine. The Rumanian Government can be sure that Russia and the Ukraine, the former s ally, do not cherish any aggressive aims in regard to Rumania, the proof of which can be furnished by the persistence with which during a whole year we have been proposing peace negotia-tions. It is in your power to remove all suspicion that there may be a danger of conflict between us, and to assure on a solid basis the mutual relations of Rumania with Russia and the Ukraine, by accepting our proposal for the convocation of a peace conference, a proposal which is still open and which it depends on you to give effect to. The Russian Government take note of your assurances and of your communica-tions as to the observance of your international duties in regard to the rebel refugees from the Crimea, and expect that your line of conduct shall strictly conform to those duties.RUSSIA.12. Trotsky on the General Situation. According to a wireless message sent from Moscow on 17th December M. Trotsky made the following report regarding the general state of affairs in Soviet Russia : For the first time since the workmen and peasants have been in power we have no military front to contend against. Having entered upon this peaceful regime, however, we must not think of complete disarmament, although at the moment no direct clanger is threatening us. The peaceful tendency of our policy, together with the reorganization of the army, bring to the fore the task of co-ordinating our economic administration. Our problem is to raise all branches of our industry, -agriculture and transport to the necessary level.   Our working strength, our technical
resources must be adequately distributed among the districts, beginning with peasant farmyards and ending with industrial centres. At the present time the Soviet of Labour and Defence will be converted into a permanent economic conference. Its tasks will be : to revive the most backward of our economic branches, to co-ordinate the work of administrative and economic organizations, to create a united economic front where the villages will work for the towns and the towns for the villages. If, in October, the workmen and peasants had not taken the power into their own bands, the country would have perished. The only country that has not been enslaved by victorious American and English imperialism is our Soviet Russia poor and exhausted though it be.Siberia.The Chita Government and the Vladivostock Assembly. Telegraphing from vladivostock-vladivostock [No. 139] on 17th December, Mr. Paton reported that the Vladivostock Assembly had decided on 5th December to recognize the Government at Chita as the central Government for the Far Eastern Republic until the convocation of the Constituent Assembly on 25th July, and to preserve the Vladivostock Assembly as an organ for local administration until that date.   The Chita Government had approved this.The Council of Ministers of the ATadivostock Government having resigned subse-quent to the recognition of the Chita Government, a new Council had been formed in which Communists predominated. There were rumours of a disagreement amongst the leading members of the Government at Chita.SERBIA.Resignation of M. Vesnic. Sir Alban Young reported from Belgrade [No. 394] on 16th December that, having accomplished his mission of carrying on the Govern-ment until the meeting of the Constituent Assembly, M. A^esnitek had resigned, and M. Pasitch had been charged to form a Ministry. Owing to ill-health, M. A7esnitch vras not likely to hold further office.On 30th December [No. 401], Sir Alban further reported that M. Pasitch had returned his mandate, as an agreement could not be reached in regard to the distribution of portfolios. He understood that he had been asked to renew his endeavours.Resignation of Dr. Breje. The following wireless message was sent from Belgrade on 17th December :   The Belgrade Council of Ministers has accepted the resignation of the Slovene President, Dr. Breje, and of three Government commis-saries belonging to the Popular party, and has entrusted the affairs of the presidency to the university professor, Dr. Leonidas Pitanitch. The vacant departments will be placed under the provisional direction of the most senior officials of the departments.Suspension of Traffic xoith Bulgaria. Sir Alban Young telegraphed from Belgrade [No. 392] as follows on 16th.
