FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Death of the Mullah. Telegraphing [No. ?] from Adis Abeba on 15th March, Mr. Russell reported that news had been received to the effect that the Mullah had died on Abyssinian territory.   His informant was the heir apparent.AUSTRIA.The Question of the Transfer of Gold [F.C.R:,- xxxviii, p. 2]. On 10th March Mr. Young reported [No. 69] from Vienna that the Federal Government had replied that they had no authority to deliver the gold, and that it was for the Austro-Hungarian Bank to decide whether.it could deliver without the consent of the Ottoman Debt administration. The bank had no objection to deliver (group omitted), but pointed out that the credit Anstalt, in the name of the Ottoman Debt administration, shared the custody of the-vaults and declined to have them opened without the consent of the said administration.Mr. Young added that he had seen the directors of the banks, who explained that legally they could not get a valid discharge, which the Austrian courts woidd recognize, from any party except the Ottoman Public Debt, and that they could not, in case of subsequent proceedings, plead Article 210 as a defence for the breach of what was a purely private contract. To safeguard themselves they required an instruction from the Ottoman Debt to deliver to a specified person, and they suggested that the Council of Ambassadors should take the necessary action to get it sent to them.CHINA.Ill-treatment of Russians.-On 17th March Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 106] as follows to Sir Beilby Alston in Pekin :-We have hitherto refrained from active intervention in a matter which we have regarded as primarily of Chinese concern. But we cannot regard with indifference a. continued state of affairs which is bound to re-act unfavourably upon the status of foreigners generally in China, The treatment of the Russians at Urga has evidently been disgraceful, and if you consider the moment opportune you should intimate to the Chinese Government that they would be well advised to act without further delay on the lines suggested in the Washington telegram No. 678 of 1920, and to prove their good faith by accepting forthwith the recommendations of the diplomatic body with regard to concessions at Tientsin and Hankow. They&apos;are on their trial,&quot; and&quot;their failure to make a proper use of their opportunities is being noted and is creating an unfavourable impression.COSTA  RICA. Dispute with Panama.---See under &quot; Panama,&quot;GEORGIA.General Situation. On 11th March Colonel Stokes reported [No. 86] that progress was being made with the Turkish military occupation of the province of Batum ; on the 15th [No. 91] that there had been an indefinite prolongation of the armistice between the Georgians and the Bolsheviks ; and on the 18th [telegram unnumbered] that the Soviet Government had been invited, by the Georgian, to occupy the province and town of Batum.In the first of these telegrams he also reported that the French commissioner had left on 11th March, and that before leaving be bad stated that as he understood that a state of war existed between the allies and Germany, he considered his -departure necessary. He was accompanied by the French diplomatic and military missions.Batum. -See p. 7 under &quot;Russia&quot; (Treaty with Turkey).
GERMANY,The Disarmament Bill. On 12th March Lord Kilmarnock reported [No. 99] thatTthe Council of State had adopted with unimportant alterations the Government bill forbidding self-defence organizations.   The minority which voted against acceptance-consisted of seven Bavarian votes.   The representative of the Bavarian Government-declared that the latter considered that the bill did not accord with the fact that the Entente had violated the treaty of peace. Neither the peace treaty nor the Spa arrangement obliged Germany to dissolve tbe self-defence organizations.    In themame of the Bavarian Government he protested in most emphatic terms against the bill.    The Minister of the Interior, who presided, said that the bill in no wav-exceeded the stipulations of the peace treaty, which the German people were bound to observe; an obligation from which they were not absolved by a breach of the treaty on the part of the Entente.   The Government were fulfilling a bitter duty in-order not to give tbe Entente an opportunity, which it was perhaps hoped would-arise, to proceed to further reprisals.Two days later Mr. Seeds telegraphed [No. 11] from Munich as follows :   The disarmament law passed by the Reichstag has aroused the greatest indigna-tion.   It had been taken for granted that the question was no longer one of urgency -owing to the collapse of the recent London negotiations.   Public opinion naturally resents (? Germans) having stood up to the Entente over our reparation demands, only to yield on the one point of the Paris decisions which vitally interests Bavaria. The fact that the law refers to the peace treaty, and not to the Paris decisions, does not help, as the attitude here has always been that the Einwohnerwehr is not a military organization, and does not therefore fall under the treaty.   The Government -and conservative circles are additionally indignant at the thought that the action of &quot;the German Government is due to a desire to propitiate the socialists.Feeling runs very strongly against Berlin, and any attempt by the latter to -enforce the law in the face of Bavaria&apos;s jnesent temper would have most serious consequences.Telegraphing [No. 12] again on the following day, Mr. Seeds reported that, speaking in the Bavarian Parliament that day, the Prime Minister had said that Avhatever might happen in the Reichstag, the Bavarian Government would maintain the opinion that the dissolution or disarmament of the Einwohnerwehr would be a mistake-in the present circumstances. He would therefore not co-operate as regards ^either dissolving or disarming the force at this moment, and he could not condemn those who refused to let themselves be deprived of their weapons.Deductions from. Payments for Exports. The following telegram [No. Ill] was sent from Berlin by Lord Kilmarnock on 20th March :- The Minister for Foreign Affairs, in an interview published to-day, mentions the suggestion that the German Government should work hand in hand with the allies by making good the amounts deducted from payment for exports, and states that this -course of action would enormously increase the inflation of paper money-, and would -amount to sanctioning the sanctions. Both economic and political grounds hindered -the German Government from taking this step.At a meeting :at the Ministry of Economic Affairs the- Prussian Minister of &quot;Commerce declared, in concert with representatives of Bavaria, Thuringia and ,. Hamburg, that there could be no question of the Government making compensation for any amounts retained by the allies so far as the future was concerned ; whether, however, firms should be assisted in any way in the case of current contracts was a -question for further consideration.The Silesian Plebiscite. -On 20th March Lord Kilmarnoc-k telegraphed [No. 113], -as follows : I received late last night a note from the Minister, for Foreign Affairs alleging Polish terror in Upper Silesia and calling on the allies to  send troops into the -country districts &quot;in-order to avoid falsification of the plebiscite.&quot;It is significant that the Minister for Foreign Affairs sent,the note to me at my private address by a secretary who was instructed to find me even if I was out.   This he did after midnight at a ball at the American Mission.    The French charge -d&apos;affaires Avas pursued in the  same manner about an hour  later.    This extreme -anxiety on the part of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to secure the delivery of notes
last night appears to give evidence of intention to allege that, in spite of warnings-^ conveyed to the allies, the latter did not take adequate measures to ensure a free-plebiscite,The French charge&apos;d&apos;affaires telephoned to Oppeln at 6 o&apos;clock last night and&apos; was informed that all was quiet..   GREECE.King Gonstantine s Appeal to the People. On 20th   March Lord   Granville telegraphed  [No.   128]  as  follows: A  message published   to-day,   from   King Constantine to his people, states that efforts to pacify the Near East by international. agreement are always met by a refusal to submit, of the organizations in Anatolia,, which try to prevent the execution of decisions based on justice and civilization,. on. the. sacrifices of Hellenism and on its undeniable national rights.   New attempts of this nature are foreshadowed by military movements and concentrations against the Greek front, and this imposes the reinforcement of Greek troops, in order to-protect the Christian populations, and to effect the final pacification of the Near East,., which is the object aimed at by Greece in common with her great allies.   &quot; Confident in the patriotism and valour of the Hellenes I call on my people to reinforce our-troops.&quot; &apos;A royal decree is published calling up classes .1913 B, 1914 and 1915.The Press on the Conference. -On 18th March Lord Granville telegraphed^ [No. 127] as follows : The proposals have not received altogether favourable comment in the press. It is pointed out that Turkey will always be a friend of Germany and an enemy of the-Entente and of Greece : hence everything which strengthens Turkey will strengthen-Germany in the future. The attitude of France in wishing to destroy part of the-treaty and coming to terms with Kemal is severely criticized. Disappointment is-expressed that Great Britain, whose interests are identical with those of Greece, should have consented to modify the treaty to please France.According to the press, Greece cannot accept proposals which would mean the-loss of Smyrna ;  and the withdrawal of the menace to Turkey in Article 36 will result in further massacres of unredeemed Greeks and Armenians.   Many papers urge-that Greece should promptly settle the matter with Kemal by force.M. Gounaris&apos;s organ, on the contrary, professes relief at the prospect of the end of&quot; the Asia Minor campaign, and seeks to blame&apos;; M. Venizelos for having entangled Greece in Asia Miiior. -HUNGARY.Negotiations with Czecho-Slovakia. On 15th March Mr. Hohler reported [No. 59] from Budapest that it had been officially announced that the Prime Minister and the-Minister for Foreign Affairs had met the Czecho-Slovak Minister and Dr. Hotovetz at the frontier town of Bruck.Telegraphing again [No. 62] on the following day he said that he had been informed that the negotiations were proceeding very favourably, that, much good - (? feeling) was shown mutually, and that arrangements were being made for consti-luting four cornmittees to settle financial, commercial, juridical and transport questions,, two to sit in Prague and two in Budapest. He added that the Bolisli Government had shown much nervousness when it heard that the two Governments were negotiating; together.ITALY.Proposed Meeting of Allied Food Commissioners.- The following telegram ;[No. 68] was sent from Rome by Sir George Buchanan oh 10th March : Signor Soleri, whom I saw this morning, is most anxious to have a meeting at Rome between the allied food commissioners, to discuss methods of avoiding collision in buying supplies, and ways of effecting the most speedy decontrol and the return to normal conditions.He has telegraphed to the Italian Ambassador, inviting Lord Crawford and Mr. McCurdy to Rome during the last week of March ; but on my telling him that this-date would not suit the former, he said he was so anxious that Lord Crawford should attend the conference that he would postpone the date of its meeting till the. weeL commencing 4th April.
PANAMA.Dispute with Costa Rica [F.C.R., xxxviii, p. 3]. Telegraphing [Nos. 1 7, 18, 19] from Panama on 8th, 10th and I4th March, Mr. Graham reported that the Almiraiite region had been evacuated by the Costa Rica troops, and the Golfito district by those of &quot;Panama, consecpi en t upon the latter country having accepted the mediation of the United States. The territorial status quo had been thus re-established pending-negotiations.The President had assured him that he dared not consent to the White award, against which the strongest possible feeling existed ; should he do so he would be in fear for his life-.According to press communications received from Washington, the State Department there had published a note stating that this refusal of Panama to accept the White award was regarded as unsatisfactory, but that the counter proposal of Panama for mediation by a commission of disinterested arbiters might be used by the United States as a basis for further negotiations.The press despatch to the effect that the secretary of the League of Nations had received an appeal from Panama for effecting a settlement had aroused considerable interest on the part of officials, many of whom expect that this appeal would necessitate for the first time a definition by the United States of their attitude towards the League of Nations in deciding disputes between nations on the American continent.A number of members of the United States Government considered that theLeague&apos;s action in using its good offices to settle disputes between such countries coidd not be interpreted as an infringement of the Monroe doctrine, inasmuch as numerous previous controversies had been arbitrated by European rulers.The Slate Department officials had declared that the possible involving of the League in these questions, as a result of Panama&apos;s appeal, would be met when the issue was raised.PERSIA.The Shall s Movements [F.C.R., xxxviii, p. 7]. In reply to Mr. Norman&apos;s telegram [No. 142] of 5th March, Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 103] on 8th March that the Shalds departure from Persia was a matter to be determined by himself and his advisers. Provided there was a Government who could conduct the affairs of the State without reference to him, there appeared to be no objection to his being away from the country. The difficulties in the way of the proposal were that His Majesty&apos;s Government were not prepared to provide any means of conveyance from Persia to Europe, and that the date of the withdrawal of British troops, as already settled, cannot be disturbed hy any arrangements as to the Shah&apos;s departure. Lord Curzon intimated that as the reasons for the- Shah&apos;s leaving Persia were based on purely personal considerations, he would scarcely be accorded a welcome in England.Future of South Persia Rifles. Referring to the decision to discontinue the South Persia Rifles as a British supported force, Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 162] on 15th March as follows : Arrangements for the disbandment of the South Persia Rifles have been considered, but so far no definite instructions have been received beyond the intimation that no funds will be forthcoming after 31st March. It is impossible to disband the force in a fortnight, and although the new Persian Government have expressed the desire io take it over, such questions as details of organization on a less costly scale ; conditions of service - of British officers ; payment for arms and equipment, &amp;c, will take&apos; some time to settle, and definite instructions are therefore urgently required.In reply to the foregoing, Lord Curzon sent the following telegram [No. 121] on 16th March : In view of the great importance of steadying the position in South Persia, and giving a chance to the efforts of the new Ministry in North Persia^ the Treasury have consented to find, a maximum sum of 225,000L to be&quot; expended upon the South Persia Rifles, with a view either to the ultimate disbandment of the force or to its incorporation in the Persian Army. 1 have tried to induce the Indian Government to take part in this expenditure, but in vain ; and it must be regarded as the final contribution on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the liquidation of the present situation. Please consider and advise as to best disposition of this sum and the period of time over which it should be spread. 26-4 B
Reorganization of the Forces [F.C.R., xxxviii, p. 6]. Referring to Mr. Normau&apos;s telegram of 3rd March, in which, he supported the Prime Ministers . application for the services of British officers in the formation of a new army, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs telegraphed [No. 117] on 14th March the views of the Army Council. The Council were not disposed to undertake any responsibility in the proposed reorganization either by lending the services of British officers or by transferring military stores. It was considered that to do so would open the way to further and unknown military commitments, for which neither troops nor funds would be forthcoming. The Council advocated the destruction of irremovable stores rather than leaving them to the Persians, with the possibility of passing into Bolshevik hands. In no case could the War Office accept responsibility for the safety of British -officers nor for extricating them from clanger. The Council-regarded the formation of a Persian force with British officers as likely to furnish the Bolsheviks with an excuse to refuse to carry out their promised evacuation of Persia on the ground that our own evacuation of the country was not genuine.The Secretary of State was in agreement with the views of the Army Council, and consequently informed Mr. Norman definitely, that J J is Majesty&apos;s Government-were not prepared to comply with the Persian Prime Minis! er&apos;s request.A further telegram [No. 156] on this subject was sent by Mr. Norman on 12th March. He recorded the Prime Minister s anxiety to start organizing a force at once to replace the British troops whose withdrawal was shortly to begin. The Prime Minister again begged for the loan of British officers, without whom the work could not be undertaken. He also pointed out that without the&quot; moral support of Great Britain it would be impossible for the new Persian Government to carry out their programme.In reply to the preceding telegram Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 123] on 17th March, saying that Avhile it was impossible for the War Office to detail compulsorily officers for sei vice in Persia, they were prepared to allow officers to volunteer under -certain conditions. These were (1) that they must be volunteers ; (2) that it must be understood that there could be no cprestion of extricating them from danger ; (3). that British Army funds must be free of all expense on their account during the period of their employment under the Persian Government,&apos;who would have to find pay, allowances, contribution towards pension, &amp;c. ; (4) that tire Army Council could not guarantee immediate re-employment of officers on expiration of their service under the Persian Government. Mr, Norman was instructed to explain the matter to the Persian Prime Minister and to point out the necessity of settling the rates of pay and considerations of service in a way that would be satisfactory to the officers employed.POLAND.Relations voith Rumania. Telegraphing [No. 124] from Poland on 8th March Mr. Max Mullex said that he had been informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he had not signed any agreement at Bucharest, and was unable to disguise his disappointment at returning without any concrete result to.show for his visit. The Minister had been much struck by the warmth of his reception in Rumania and the apparent popularity of Poland, which far exceeded that of Rumania amongst the Poles. He spoke of the excellent Rumanian army-, and felt quite satisfied that Poland and Rumania together could withstand any Bolshevik attack. He also made much of the inclusion in the commercial convention to be signed, of a clause guaranteeing to Poland the free use of the port of Braila.Trade Proposals by the Soviet Government. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has just informed the Commercial Secretary that M. Joffe has made the following proposal at Riga to M. Dabski, the head of the Polish Peace Delegation :  .The Soviet Government will, at regular intervals, hand to the Polish Government a sum of 18,00.0,000 roubles in gold, with which the latter, after deduction of 3,000,000 roubles commission, will purchase goods abroad for the Soviet Government in accordance with the latteFs instructions.Prince Sapieha, being opposed to the scheme, has instructed M. Dabski to give an evasive answer, and hopes that M. Joffe will not press the matter ; he thinks, however, that it. is a confirmation of the opinion, which he repeatedly expressed to Sir Percy Loraine, that Poland will play an important part in trade with Soviet Russia.   Prince
:Sapieha doubts whether Russia will be.in a position to export anything abroad except -corn and sugar, and thinks that the Soviet Government will agree to the exploitation by the Poles of the sugar factories in Soviet Russia.RUSSIA.Massage for M. Chicherin.  On 17th. March the-following message from Lord &quot;Ourzon was telegraphed [No.  26]   to   Mr. Leslie  at   Reval  for transmission to M. Ghieheriu :  His Majesty&apos;s Government have now issued orders to the officers commanding &quot;the British fleet afloat, cancelling the instructions with regard to hostile action to be &quot;taken towards submarines controlled by the Soviet Government, as communicated to you in my telegram of 26th September last.His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore trust that the Soviet Government on its part will see its way to the immediate issue of instructions to officers in command of submarines that such vessels will only approach British men-of-war in daylight, and -on the surface with their colours flying.   This is the accepted practice with British --submarines in the presence of foreign vessels.Treaty with Turkey. The following wireless messages were sent from Moscow -en 19th March by M. Chicherin :  (1) On 16th March in Moscow the treaty between Russia and Turkey was signed, -establishing friendly and fraternal relations between both countries. The treaty was signed on our side by the people&apos;s commissary for Foreign Affairs, M. Chicherin and M. Korkmasoff. a member of the Ail-Russian central executive committee. For Turkey the treaty was signed by the president of the delegation of the Great National Assembly of Turkey and the people&apos;s commissary for National Economy, Yusuf Kemal, the people&apos;s commissary for National Education, Riza Nur Beem, and the -Plenipotentiary-Extraordinary to Russia, Ali Fuad Pasha.(2) Batum will belong to Georgia, but with autonomy. Nakhitchevan will be under the protectorate of Azerbaijan. The Turkish debts to Russia are cancelled. Turkey&apos;s territory is fixed upon the basis of the Turkish National pact. The statute for the straits will be elaborated by a commission.The French and General Wrangel. Telegraphing [No. .186] from Constantinople -on 17th March, Sir Horace Rumbold reported that he had been informed by his French colleague that his Government could not undertake to continue the provisioning of Russian refugees ; and that, acting under instructions, he had written to General Wrangel calling upon him to break up his military formations with a view to either repatriation or emigration.SERBIA.Attitude towards Hungary. Mr. Hohler telegraphed [No. 60] from Budapest on 17th March that he had been told by the Serbian Minister that his Government was -desirous of establishing better relations with Hungary, without, of course, making -any endeavour to interfere with the frontier as defined by the treaty.   Mr. Holder -considered that this attitude could not be regarded as otherwise than satisfactory, and - -attributed it in part to the manifest interest taken in the negotiations which were proceeding between Hungary and Czecho-Slovakia.-    SPAIN.The New Ministry. Sir Esme Howard telegraphed [Nos. 62, 63] as follows from Madrid on 13th March : In view of the gravity of the situation created by the death of Senor Dato, the . King of Spain, after hearing the leaders of the various parties, first charged Senor Maura with the formation of a coalition Cabinet (one group omitted) Count Romahones . -and other liberals ; and the formation of such a Cabinet was actually announced in the papers yesterday.It appears, however, that later the conservative groups in the Chamber, which, -counted together, had a majority, considered that they were not sufficiently repre-sentecl in the Cabinet, and Senor Maura abandoned his plan. Senor Allende-Salazar wras then called upon, and has formed a Government which it is believed will have
&quot;the support of all the conservative parties. The appointment which has been most commented on is that of Seiior cle la Cierva, whose railway policy was diametrically opposed to that of the late Government.The following is the list of the new Government: Senor Allende-Salazar - President of Council.The Marquess de Lema - - - Foreign Affairs.Senor Pin as -          - - - - Justice.Senor Arguelles      - - - Finance.Count Bugallal        - Interior.Sen or de la Cierva  - - - - - Public Works.Viscount de Eza Marina Prida - - War.Senor Aparicio        - - - - Public Instruction.Count de Lizarraga - Labour.The Ministers for Foreign Affairs, War, the Interior and Finance were members of the last Cabinet,TURKEY. ,The Greek Regime in the Smyrna Vilayet.--The High Commissioner s Represen-tative in Smyrna telegraphed [No. 4] on 17th March as follows : The complaints of the Turkish Government that the Greeks have resorted to subterfuge and intimidation to obtain Moslem notables&apos; written declarations of their satisfaction at the existing regime appear well founded.Towards the end of February, demonstrations were organized in Smyrna and many places in the occupied zone with the object of impressing the conference with the unanimous desire of the population for the maintenance of Greek administration ; at the same time a general order seems to have been issued to Greek officials in the-interior to obtain Moslems&apos; declarations in the same sense. All sorts of means were used to this end.The Representative quoted numerous instances, which had been communicated to him, of the inhabitants of different towns and villages having been induced by trickery to sign a declaration of loyalty.   He then proceeded to say : In general it. appears that Moslems were asked to sign these mazbatas by officials having practically absolute power over them, and they did so for fear of the consequences of refusal.. They are certainly not spontaneous.UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.Foreign Policy. Sir Auckland Geddes reported [No. 141] on 14th March that the Secretary of State had recently intimated, when interviewed by press correspondents,, that the foreign policy of the new administration would be based, on the assertion of American rights in the same state as before the war. As the United States had not ratified the treaty of Versailles, it was held that these rights could not be affected by it. The new administration approved and endorsed the policy of its xDreclecessor-on all important points, particularly as regards cables and oil. Mr. Hughes was reported, however, to have disavowed the idea of forfeiting the &quot;fruits of victory.&apos;&apos; This disclaimer is looked upon by some people as a repudiation of Mr. Knox&apos;s resolution in favour of a separate peace with Germany.Declaration  by   the   President. -Telegraphing   [No.   152]  on   18th  March, Sir Auckland Geddes sent the following: Yesterday was the anniversary of the evacuation of Boston by British troops, and a parade to celebrate the occasion has been the means of calling forth a useful declaration of policy from president Harding. Local officers commanding the United States navy and army units in Boston refused permission for their men to take part in the parade on the grounds that the American. Association for recognition of the Irish Republic had been invited and intended to -appear in the parade.   An appeal against the decision of the local commanders was-made to. the Secretaries of the Navy and Army.   These upheld the decisions of their subordinates.   An appeal against the decisions of the Secretaries was made to the-Presi dent, who replied : &quot;The naval and military forces of the nation can have no part in any demonstration which can be construed as influencing the foreign relations of&quot; the Republic.&quot;
