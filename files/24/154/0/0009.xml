FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.General Alnlleson&apos;s Reports. Telegraphing on 12th and 19th January, the Viceroy of India transmitted reports from General Malleson to the following effect:-(1) It was said that a commercial treaty was being negotiated between Afghanistan and Bokhara; (2) it Avas reported that&apos; orders had been received by the Afghan troops in Merv to return to their own country ; (3) Abdul Baki, the Afghan Consul for Meshed and presumably Mahmud Tarsi&apos;s brother-in-law, had reached Herat.Emissaries from Constantinople. On 11th January the Viceroy reported that at the end of December two emissaries had reached Kabul. They Avere said to have come from Constantinople. They had a private interview with the Amir, in whose presence a pan-Islamic and anti-Christian proclamation, Avhich they had brought Avith them, was read out in the mosque by the Kabul mullah.Activities of Nadir Khan. -On 11th January the Viceroy Further reported the intention of Nadir Khan to Ausit Dakka Avhere he expected to be met by jirgas of our North-West Frontier tribes ; he Avas then at Jalalabad inspecting troops and inter-viewing jirgas of the Ningrahar tribes.ARABIA.King Hussein and Ibn saud. On 11th January Lord Allenby reported [No. 22] that he had had an interview with the King of Ilejaz, who had spoken at considerable length in regard to Syria and his claim to be recognized as leader of the Arabs, but he, Lord Allenby, had replied that he Avas unable to discuss either matter. King-Hussein said that the Ibn Saud question was a matter of A&apos;ery little importance ; but he had undertaken to endeaA^our to come to a friendly arrangement Avith him and Avas Avilling to meet him at Jeddah. &apos;AUSTRIA.Relations -with Czeeho-Slovahia. Mr. Lindley reported on loth January [No. 23] that the State Chancellor had returned from Prague and that he had had a short comversation with him. The Chancellor said that he had found some members of the Czech Government Avell disposed, but that concessions to Austria either in the matter of coal or in that of sugar would! not be popular, and the elections were at hand. He did not conceal his disappointment at the meagre economic results of his visit,Mr. Gosling, hoAvever, telegraphing from Prague [No. 9] on the following- clay, reported that he had been informed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs that a protocol had been signed by the Austrian State Chancellor and himself in regard not only to the export of sugar and coal to Vienna, but also as to co-operation against any possible reaction or Bolshevism.Bolshevism and Food. Telegraphing on 18th Januaiy [no number] Mr. Lindley reported that on the previous day there had been an official reception of the Diplomatic Corps by the State Chancellor Avho had spoken somewhat seriously of the delay in settling the matter of food supplies, and also of the Bolshevik clanger. These two questions, Mr. Lindley said, were closely allied, and he ventured to call the most serious attention of His Majesty&apos;s Gcwernment to the possibility of a BolsheArik Government in Vienna and the results thereof ; and there probably Avould be such a. Government if a sufficiency of flour Avas not-secured for the population.Mr. Lindley&apos;s telegram was repeated [No. 97] to Lord Derby in Paris on 22nd&apos; January, with a request that the latter Avould ascertain from the Reparation Commis-sion Avhat was the position as regarded the release of liquid assets to enable^ $100,000,000 to be. raised in neutral countries.Lord Derby, telegraphing [No. 103] on 27th January, reported as follows : The Reparation Commission considers that in view of the great progress recently made with the scheme for proA-iding large relief credit to Austria, the immediate difficulties
described by Mr. Lindley may soon be ended, and that therefore the present is not the moment to place a large amount of liquid assets at Austria&apos;s disposal for her to realize at forced prices, especially as such assets will form the main security for new advances to be made and furnish the best means of rehabilitating the country. Apart from art treasures sold in large quantities at a time, Austria has no assets on which she could raise f 100,000,000 at short notice without ruinous sacrifice. The Reparation Commission states it is, however, allowing the Austrians, in view of possible hitches in concluding credit arrangements, to&apos;continue negotiations for raising-money on the tobacco monopoly, i.e., the asset which could be turned to immediate account with the best hope of success. It is also [group omitted] but not certain that her foreign securities (except in so far as they are chargeable under economic clauses of the Treaty) may be released to her for disposal as she finds most profitable.THE BALTIC.Border Slate Conference. Telegraphing from Helsingfors on ICth January [No. 55], Lord Acton reported that at the opening meeting of the Border State Conference on the previous day the following Commissions were formed: (1) A Presidential Commission to deal with general questions. (2) A Political Commission to deal with general political questions concerning the participating States. (3) A Native Commission to deal with frontier questions. (4) A Commission to deal with defence and the military question.   (5) An Economic Commission.Telegraphing again on 26th January, he reported that in the public statement made by the Finnish Prime Minister on the close of the Conference, the results were summed up as follows : The Conference agreed that all differences of opinion on territorial questions between themselves, or between themselves and Russia, should be decided on the basis of the popular right of self-determination; this wras important to Finland with regard to East Carelia, the liberation of the population of that country from foreign sway being one of the main points of her foreign policy. The Conference hoped that the independence of Esthonia, Lettland and Lithuania would be internationally recognized de jure as soon as possible. The Conference had agreed on a common programme of defence against the Eastern danger. The Bolsheviks were then holding further Carelia and following an imperialist policy south of the Gulf of Finland.&apos; Relations with Soviet Russia were to be settled in agreement with the Entente, in so far as this could be done, having regard to the conditions vital to the life of the separate States. The latter were opposed to Bolshevism, which they believed would soon be replaced by a democratic system in Russia, whether the Bolshevik system fell or was overthrown by force of arms. The States hoped that the former might be the case and saw signs that it would be so. The vital interests of these States must not be sacrificed to Russia, but the Russian people must create their own political life, The Conference was agreed on the arrangement of economic and commercial conditions. The States represented have enormous possibilities of development by mutual exchange of goods, especially if Ukraina should join them.. Poland recognized the independence of Lithuania ; their differences only concerned the froutier, and a special Commission, to meet in Vilna, was proposed to clear up the differences, between these two States. The question of the neutralization of the Baltic was to be considered, and submitted to a later Conference. It was specially important for Finland and Esthonia that the Gulf of Finland should be neutralized; especially as the Bolsheviks were planning to build a fortress on Hogiancl, wdiich would command the whole Gulf ; it was, however, also important to the other States to avoid the necessity of maintaining an expensive fleet in those waters.The Libau Speech [F.C.R. viii, p. 3]. Telegraphing from Libau on 19th January [No. 11], Mr. Whyte reported that the Chief of the French Mission had withdrawn the remark-about Esthonia, excusing, himself on- the ground that at that time there were signs of a conflict between that country and the Letts.;     ... &apos;     &apos; THE CAUCASUS.Recognition of the Armenian Government. On:21st January the Foreign Office instructed  [No. 42] Mr. Wardrop to inform the Armenian Government that theA2
Supreme Council at Paris Pad decided that it should be recognized as a de facto Government,: on condition that such recognition should in no way prejudice; the . eventual settlement of frontiers.   It was, of course, understood that this decision was confined to the Armenian State now existing with its capital at Erivan, and did not affect Turkish Armenia.Help for the Caucasian States, On 21st January the Foreign Office informed [No. 41] Mr. Wardrop that the principle of sending help (in the shape of munitions, arms, and, if possible, food) to Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan had been accepted by the Supreme Council in Paris. Instructions to constdt as to the means of effecting this had been given to the General Staffs of Great Britain and France, by Avhom General Milne had been asked to send an officer from Batum to visit the States and report.Azerbaijan and Turkey. On 25th January Admiral Webb telegraphed from Constantinople [No. 76] that it was widely believed there that a good understanding, on more or less pan-Islamic lines, was being negotiated, if indeed it had not been already reached, between Azerbaijan and either the Turkish Government or Mustapha Kemal or both.Polish Mission. On 19th January Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed from Warsaw [No. 40], reporting that the Polish Ministry for Foreign Affairs had informed him that it was despatching a political and economic Mission to the Caucasus accredited to the Governments of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, in order to establish consular posts, to take the necessary measures to safeguard Polish property, and to organize the re-emigration of Polish nationals from or across the Caucasus. The Mission would start at the end of January and would probably remain six months in the Caucasus.CHINA.Mongolia. In reply to Lord Curzon&apos;s telegram of 12th January [EC.R. viii., p. 5], Sir John Jordan telegraphed [No. 29a], on 19th January, that the Russian Minister at&quot; Pekin had often suggested to him the possibility of making a jjrotcst against the Chinese action in Mongolia, but that he had not encouraged the idea. The Russian Minister recognized that the Allies had done all they could for Russia, and that the Mongolian question must wait until the Russian Government was re-established.Sir John Jordan pointed out that, taking advantage of the Chinese revolution in 1911, Russia had ousted Chinese influence in Mongolia, and China was only getting her own back again in taking advantage of the Russian breakdown. China, moreover, could excuse her action on the grounds of endeavouring to protect her own frontier, to resist the Bolshevik menace, and to counteract the activities of Seminoff with the Japanese. The apparent result of Allied intervention in Siberia had been to provide a footing there for Japan, and there was no reason for furnishing her with a similar opening in Mongolia by joining in a protest which would undoubtedly occasion great resentment in China.. China desired peace, and would continue to do so so long as she was treated fairly by the Allies. Japanese propaganda in London and Paris, and messages emanating from the Times and the Daily Mail were doing considerable mischief in exaggerating the fear of Bolshevism. The best way to protect China against Bolshevism would be to get rid of the militarists whose present position was solely due to financial aid from Japan.The Position at Macao. An incident having arisen between the Chinese and the Portuguese over Macao, a seaport town in Kwang Tung, Sir John Jordan telegraphed [No. 43] on 25th January that he had received from our representative at Canton the following account of the approximate position : The Chinese complain that Macao is buoying the harbour, reclaiming land, and placing a gun menacing-Chin esa territory.This being contrary to the agreement&apos; that the status quo be maintained pending, delimitation, and their remonstrances having- hitherto been treated with scant courtesy,, they sent troops and war vessels to emphasize their protests, but, they allege, without, aggressive -intentions. The Minister of the. Interior, VYu, promised yesterday to-refrain from further action until Lisbon had been communicated with. The Portuguese claim that they are entirely within their rights, and that the despatch of troops and vessels is unfriendly. , .:.    a
At the request &quot;of the Governor, the Portuguese&apos; Gonsul-General is addressing to-day a Note to the Local Government,&quot; asking that troops be retired- from the boundary in order to avoid accidental, collisions, and that arrangements be come to for tlie immediate appointment of a joint Delimitation Commission. I.: have told the Portuguese Consul-General that he should suggest to His&apos;Excellency a complete suspension of all works such as those to which exception is taken.Having received yesterday a telegram from, a British subject stating that rioting had occurred at Chien Shan, and that an attack on life and property was apprehended, I asked the naval authorities to despatch a British war vessel for purposes of observation, as Macao is a nest of characters of the worst description, and even the Portuguese might be unable to cope with a mob outbreak. I have every hope that neither Government will act precipitately.Sir John Jordan expressed the fear that it would be useless for the Government of Macao to ask for the appointment of a joint Delimitation Commission at present. In 11)09, such a Commission, after &quot;-spending many months in investigating the question, had failed to arrive at a settlement. He considered the chance of coming to an arrangement which would be acceptable to the Chinese was far less now than it was in those clays.FRANCE.The Neio Government. In a despatch [No. 136], dated 20th January, Lord Derby made the following comments on the personnel of the new French Government: It consists of fifteen Cabinet Ministers and ten Under Secretaries of State. Of its twenty-five members only two are Senators as compared with nineteen Deputies, while four are non-parliamentarians, namely, M. Marsal, Minister for Finance, M. Ricard, Minister, for Agriculture, M. Ogier, Minister for the liberated Districts, and M. Coupat, Under Secretary of State for Technical Education. Only three of its members held office in M. Clemenceau&apos;s Cabinet, namely, M. Le Troquer. Minister for Public Works and Transport, M. Jourclain, the Alsatian Deputy, who remains Minister for Labour, and M. Louis Desehamps, who becomes Under Secretary for Posts and Telegraphs.The most striking feature of the new Ministry is the number of those who have hitherto played no leading part in political life, but have specialized in their particular subjects, or have distinguished themselves in their own profession, such as M. Ricard, who six months ago was appointed Secretary-General of the National Federation of Agricultural Associations, and il. Coupat, who is Secretary-General of the Federation of Mechanics. Trade unionism is thus represented in the Government for the first time.Another notable appointment is that of the new Minister of Finance, who was a director of the Parisian Union Bank, served during the war on the staff of General Headquarters, and has recently distinguished himself by his articles in the Press on the reorganization of French finances.Among the specialists in their own subjects may also be mentioned M. Le Troquer, the new Minister of Public Works, who is by profession an engineer, and was a director of inland navigation, M. Emmanuel Brousse, a prolific writer for many years on financial economy, M. Flandrin and M. Borrel, who have taken a noticeable part in all the recent discussions on the subject of aviation, and the use of &quot; white -coal&quot; -respectively, and who now become Under-Secretaries for Aviation and. Hydraulic Power.M. Millerand has created a new Ministerial post, namely, that of Pensions, as well as the new .Under Secretaryships of Hydraulic Power, Posts and Telegraphs and. Technical Education.A further innovation is the appointment of an Under Secretary of State to the-President of the Council, which will enable M. Millerand to combine the duties of Minister for Foreign Affairs without losing touch with the general supervision of his Cabinet.GERMANY.The Foreign Minister and Chancellor on the Situation. Telegraphing from Berlin on 16th January [No. 2],,Lord Kilmarnock reported as follows : &quot;s* -- &apos; I presented my letter of credence to the Geruian:Minister: for Foreign Affairs this morning. . * :
He asked me to thank your Lordship, and declared that he would do his best to lielp towards the solution of the questions which would arise &apos; during, the&apos;difficult period which must precede the re-establishment of friendly relations between our countries after a great war which had had such disastrous consequences for the whole world. He assured me in the name of his Government that Germany was truly desirous of working for the maintenance of a lasting peace.I thanked him for this declaration, and said I was convinced that His Majesty&apos;s Government were also desirous that the peace should prove a lasting one.Telegraphing again on 19th-January [No. 10], he said:  I was received to-daj^ by the Chancellor, Herr Bauer. He said Germany intended to fulfil the terms of the Treaty to the full extent of what she was physically capable. She Avas not in a position to display any political activity abroad, and the questions AAdiich AA-ould arise Avere of an economic character. Her people Avere in need of food, clothing and raw materials, and they looked to the Entente PoAvers for assistance in procuring these, and thus enabling them to resume their industrial activity. They were at present in a state of abnormal excitement, which only a sufficiency of the necessities of life could allay. In the meantime a kind of dictatorship was necessary to prevent the spread of the Bolshevik spirit, AAdiich could not be allowed to bring ruin on the nation. The Chancellor, who spoke with energy and confidence, did not seem to he pessimistic in regard to.the future,, and appeared to consider that a definite conclusion of peace would bring about an amelioration in the situation.Proposed Discussion of the International Financial Situation. The following Avireless message Avas despatched from Norddeich on 21th January : The German Press of all parties points out that only a common discussion, with the participation of Germany and German-Austria as Avell as of the neutral countries, in regard to the international financial situation and fall in the exchange A^value of the currencies of most of the European Great Powers, can prevent a world catastrophe. Germany can only pay the sum required from her by the Entente if her former enemies recognize the principle that a debtor, to be solvent, must have vitality. EATen the situation of the victorious States, which have been gravely injured by the Avar, could not be improved &quot;by the destruction of Germany ; and this-view is spreading, not only among neutral States, but among Entente countries.GUATEMALA.The New Political Party. Telegraphing from Guatemala on 24th Januaiy [No. 7], Mr. Armstrong reported a continual and rapid increase in the popularity of the new party whose real object was daily becoming more apparent; that object, was the overthrow of the President. Important persons connected with the party were being arrested, and the political situation gave some cause for anxiety.HUNGARY.Food Supplies. On 21st Januaiy Mr. Holder telegraphed [No. 29] from Budapest reporting that the representative of the &quot;Supreme Economic Council had stated that for the last week no food supplies had been arriving from Rumania ; the population had been depending on them, but now supplies.might be expected from Serbia. He also said that the stocks were over than at any previous time, and that the town was -on half rations, a state of things which could not continue ; an outbreak might take place any day. .On 23rd January the Foreign Office instructed [No. 22] Mr. Hohler that he might make an unofficial intimation to Admiral Horthy that His Majesty&apos;s Government thought that an understanding with Serbia would be the best course for Hungary to adopt, as the Serbian Government AVere in the best position to furnish food supplies.But en the 26th -January a telegram [No. 31] was sent to Mr. Rattigan at Bucharest instructing him to make immediate enquiries in regard to the facts stated by Mr. Hohler, and to represent strongly to the Rumanian GoA^ernment the necessity for applying an immediate remedy, their attention being caUed to the increase in -general BolsheAusm which must result from a cessation of food supplies in any particular area in South-East Europe.
Rumanian Activities.- On 20th January Mr. Holder telegraphed [No. 30] as follows:  -Your Lordship is doubtless.aware that the inter-allied Commission recently sent from Budapest under the auspices of the Supreme Council was refused permission to cross the Theiss by the Rumanian authorities. The representative of the Supreme Economic Council was also refused permission to cross the Theiss.I continue to hear such incredible stories of Rumanian activities in the occupied territory, which receive disagreeable corroboration from above fact,- that I venture to suggest that it is desirable fur the credit, if not of the Entente, at least of His Majesty&apos;s Government, to send a mission to enquire into the facts and to collect reliable evidence. Perhaps this could best be done from Bucharest, but the presence of a person speaking Hungarian would be indispensable.- - The Executions. In the course of a despatch [No. 5], dated 12th January, Mr. Hohler wrote as follows : I then raised the question of the execution of Bolsheviks in Budapest, explaining that General Gorton had carried out the instructions, which, if T had been in Budapest, it would have been my duty to act upon. I added that even if, as the Hungarian Courts alleged and I was prepared to believe, only murderers and robbers had so far been tried and executed, still the fact that so many executions had been carried &quot;out was creating an unfortunate impression in the outside world, and the fact that the trials and executions were being spread over a long period tended to aggravate this effect. The Prime Minister said that he himself was a very humane man, that he hated the idea of killing anyone, but that (1) those who had been tried were riot political prisoners, but murderers ; (2) they had been tried according to Hungarian law by the official Hungarian judges; (3) that the only point in which the law was not strictly adhered to was that the prisoners had been granted permission to&quot; appeal against the death sentences ; (4) that if he were to interfere all the judges in the country would resign ; (5) if the murderers were not jmnished by law, lynchiugs would commence all over the country and many comparatively innocent people would be killed. If he were to pardon these criminals it would be interpreted as immunity for Bolsheviks, and would on the one hand encourage them, and [on the other] exasperate the respect-able mass of the people.ITALY.The Fiume Settlement. Sir George Buchanan sent the following telegram [No. 28] from Rome to Lord Curzon on 26th January : The President of the Council spoke to me to-claj&apos; with great satisfaction of the result of his visits to Paris and London, and expressed his warm appreciation of the very friendly reception accorded to him by vou and the Prime Minister, fie once more emphasized his desire of maintaining the closest possible understanding with His Majesty&apos;s Government.Though he would naturally have preferred to secure Italian sovereignty over Fiume, he was personally satisfied with the settlement that had been arrived at, and he believed it would be favourably received by the Chamber. It would, of course, be attacked by the partisans of D&apos;Annunzio and by the followers of Baron Sonnino. Should the Belgrade Government persist in rejecting it, he would have to insist on the strict application of the Treaty of London. He was, however, fully alive to the importance of cultivating friendly relations with the Jugo Slavs, and would therefore^ only wish to see it applied in the last resort.POLAND.The General Position. On 19th January Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed from Warsaw saying that he thought it right to submit his opinion on the present position of Poland, as affected by the. collapse of General Denikin&apos;s army : The military situation here has entirely changed since Mr. Mackinder passed through Warsaw. As far as can be foreseen, the Bolsheviks, when they think they have finished with General Denikin, will be free to attack Poland with the whole of their forces, since it would, appear that the..Rumanian army is in a strong defensive position. This is not the case with the Polish army. The prospects of a Bolshevik offensive in. the spring against Poland are no doubt being skilfully exploited by Bolshevik, and possibly German, propaganda in Poland itself.   But it is a contingency
with which to reckon. In-ray opinion it will anyhow not he possible for the Poles to continue for any appreciable length of time their present limited operations against the Bolsheviks. Although these operations are not costly in men, the expenditure involved is reacting unfavourably on the internal political situation, and the financial resources of the country, and adding to its economic difficulties. The Polish Government are therefore faced, as they have pointed out, with the alternative of making peace now, when they can do so on advantageous terms, or, as they say, endeavouring to prosecute the war to a successful conclusion with the help of the Allies.Unless I am mistaken, the Poles, through either of the above courses, hope to-achieve three main points : (1) A settlement of their eastern frontier combined with a solution of the Lithuanian and White Russian questions in a way which they would consider satisfactory to themselves ; (2) immediate economic and financial relief ; and (3) the means of effectually controlling and checking Bolshevik propaganda in Poland., ,On&apos;the other hand, if the Poles continue their present limited operations without any definite objective, and without Allied support, even supposing the Bolsheviks were to allow them to retain the initiative in military matters, they risk an eventual defeat supposing the Bolsheviks attack them with all their forces. They would then have to make peace on very unfavourable terms. The Prime Minister has said that if, on the return of M. Patekfrom Paris, further deliberations are necessary with regard to the terms of the definitive reply of the Polish Government to the Bolshevik peace offer, the Polish Government- would wish to concert the terms of that reply with the Allied representatives. Whilst it is right that the Poles should keep the Allied Governments informed, through the Allied representatives here, of their decision with regard to the Bolshevik peace offer, it seems to me that the Poles wish to throw too much responsibility on the Allies in this matter, which, I think, ought to be determined principally by Polancfs own interests. Having said this, however, I am convinced that the Prime Ministers intention is due to his confidence in one or two of the Allied Ministers here, and is not solely dictated by a desire to shift the responsibility for a decision on to the Allied Governments. In anticipation of the Polish Government applying to me for advice with regard to the terms of their reply to the Bolshevik peace offer, I should be grateful if your Lordship Avould telegraph whether you would approve my replying that this is a matter as to which the Poles should be principally guided by their own interests.Authoritative statements recently made in the Press that Poland is now the only barrier against Bolshevism have forced this country into the limelight, and the Polish Government will no doubt take advantage of that fact.The situation here is undoubtedly serious from every point of view. Prices are rising daily ; meat is no longer within reach of the poor, and economic- conditions generally are favourable for the spread of Bolshevism. Typhus is spreading through-out the country. The value of the mark is steadiPy depreciating, nothing is being; exported, and the Poles are now in a vicious circle from which there are only two avenues of escape, i.e., a settlement of one sort or another with the Bolsheviks, and,, eventually, the resumption of exports. But the Poles will only be able to begin exporting later on in the year when the economic situation should improve. If the plebiscites in the Teschen area and in Upper Silesia go in favour of the Poles their economic prospects will, of course, become much brighter.I do not think that in present circumstances the Polish army by itself can finally dispose of the Bolsheviks, although the Polish troops are infinitely sirperior to the Bolshevik troops. The Polish army might, in co-operation with the ^Rumanian army, bring the Bolsheviks to terms. The alternative is to remain on the defensive, dout in order to maintain a successful defensive the Poles will undoubtedly require -considerable support in the way of military equipment and railway material so as to improve their communications at the front. They would also need to transfer all their troops from the western to the eastern front, and would, in this connexion,, -undoubtedly ask the Allies to guarantee them against molestation by the Germans or Czechs. The Polish Government are well aware of the critical situation of the -country, and will not be slow to exploit this fact to the utmost in asking for Allied support.Looking at the problem from a general point of view, it seems clear that if the Polish barrier against Bolshevism goes, the barrier will be shifted much further west, and an opportunity will be given to latent Bolshevism in Czecho-Slovakia to join hands with Russian Bolshevism, thereby creating a very serious state of things for Central Europe and the Western Powers.
To sum up, whilst I would strongly deprecate a Polish offensive against the Bolsheviks, i f the Poles are to -stand alone. 1 am of opinion -that everything should be done to assist them 1 to withstand a Bolshevik offensive. The latter policy would necessarily, tend to make the Poles more amenable in regard to tbe-eventuaPsettlement of their eastern frbntierVarid of the Lithuanian and Whitelfrrssiah questions.&apos; We should have a hold over them and be able to check any imperialistic tendencies. -It would be of interest to this Legation to be kept informed of any developments as between Rumania and the Bolsheviks. -Relations with Lithuania. Telegraphing on 19th Januaiy [No. 12], Sir Horace Rumbold reported that the Polish Ministry, for Foreign Affairs had complained in an official Note that on 11th and 11th January respectively, Lithuanian detachments had attacked Polish posts at Owanty and Stokliszki ; that an aggressive activity, on the part of Lithuanian patrols had been reported from a number of other localities ; that the Supreme Command had received information of Lithuanian concentrations at Koszedary and Olita ; that a propaganda was being conducted among the Lithuanian troops, even by means of official proclamations, inciting them to war against Poland in order to take Vilna; that the foregoing facts clearly indicated aggressive Lithuanian intentions. .The Polish Government, Sir Horace went on to say, inferred that an agreement had been made between the Lithuanians and the Bolsheviks, but he did not believe that this inference was correct.The Note also stated that, as the Polish troops concentrated against the Bolsheviks could not risk the exposure of their communications and flank to a sudden attack, the Polish Government had taken steps to prevent any Lithuanian detachment from crossing the Dvina.Telegraphing again [No. 13] on the following day, Sir Horace said that owing to the recent Lithuanian attacks on Polish posts the tension between the two peoples had greatly increased. Those attacks, he said, might be attributed to Lithuanian indignation at being cut off, by the junction of the Poles with the Letts, from contact with Soviet Russia, with whom the Lithuanians were probably doing a remunerative trade. The Chief of the State had stated that his patience was nearby exhausted, and that if the Lithuanian aggression should continue he would attack them in force and take Kovno.RUMANIA.The Credit for Trade with Soviet Russia. On 21th January Mr. Rattigan reported from Bucharest [No. 48] that the announcement of the credit for trade with Soviet Russia had produced a very painful impression; it was regarded as a complete Allied surrender to the Bolsheviks, and this opinion was that of one and all. The statement that the policy towards the Bolsheviks remained the same evoked no confidence, the argument being that the re-establishment of trade &quot; relations necessarily involved the restoration of full relations.RUSSIA.Conditions -in Soviet Russia. Telegraphing from Warsaw on 16th January [No 27, received 21st January], Sir Horace Rumbolcl reported that Polish prisoners who had returned from Soviet Russia had furnished to the local Press the following description of the conditions in Moscow and other towns of northern and central Russia :: The inhabitants of these towns are described as slowfy-dying madmen, who can think of nothing but food. Factories, trams, and- electric power stations for lighting the towns are standing idle for lack of fuel, which is practically unobtainable even for heating private houses. With a certificate that a person is dangerously ill, six to ten small logs of wood may be obtained. Food cannot be properly cooked. Illnesses are -spreading and typhus is ravaging the towns.Potatoes cost 50 roubles a pound, potato parings 25 roubles a pound, and a p*ood of flour 16,000 roubles. Exchanges are frecpiently made, such as a piano for two pounds -of flour, a gold watch for two pounds of sugar. Ordinary trade is non-existent. -. -    -A new kind of terror, known as the Black Terror, has been instituted ; in some small town or village-a member of a fairly rich or intelligent family is arrested and 7-5 &apos; &quot; B &apos;   .
kept in prison until the inhabitants of his.town or village make a riot, when, he is immediately shot. One of these Polish prisoners himself saw six motor, lorries leaving a Soviet building in Moscow&apos; laden with the bodies of members of-the Cadet Party who had been shot.       ... .-. &apos; &apos;The Moscow Bolsheviks&apos;.continually organize ^searches during which the troops surround whole quarters of the town and the lives and property of the inhabitants are at the mercy of the Red Guards.&quot; ------The Copenhagen Negotiations. On 21st January Mr. Chicherin, Commissarv for Foreign Affairs, sent the&apos;following&apos;wireless message to Lord Gurzon :--On 19th September, in answer to your radio of 15th September, we pointed out that Denmark -would not be a place well fitted for the Conference between the delegates of our two countries, and. we tried to make it clear that we could not allow our representative to be placed in humiliating conditions of semi-arrest. We rejected especially every attempt of a semi-internment of our delegate in a special place of abode. In your radio of 15th October you insisted that the choice of.Denmark guaranteed to our - delegation freedom of movement, and promised that no special place of abode would be assigned to them. We accordingly withdrew our objections, being desirous of meeting in every possible way the wish of the British Government, Unfortunately the promises of the Danish Government have been grossly violated, and the guarantees given to us by the British Government have proved now to be without effect. The stipulation concerning our delegated freedom of abode has been transgressed by the Danish Government; from the beginning it has created intolerable conditions for his work, and many times already has our delegate, Mr. Litvinoff, insisted to Mr. 0&apos;Grady ripon the necessity of transferring the nego-tiations to another country. This transfer has now become inevitable, owing to the conduct of the Danish. Government, and the Soviet Government sees itself compelled to insist upon the immediate adoption of measures in this sense. The perpetual presence of a number of detectives at the hotel where Mr. Litvinoff resides has had the result that the hotel-keeper objects to his further presence, and at the same time the Danish authorities do not allow Mr. Litvinoff to choose himself his place of abode and to move freely, so that he virtually is in a state of semi-arrest. The Danish Government has not kept its promise, and the pledge given by the British Govern-ment remains without effect. Just now, when a satisfactory outcome of the pourparlers seems to be imminent, this happy result,.so desirable for both-countries, is rendered impossible until the Conference is transferred. We protest most strongly against our delegate being put in a state of semi-arrest, and we do not doubt that the British Government will readily meet our most lawful desire.Uncultivated Land in Soviet Russia. According to a wireless message despatched from Moscow on 20th January, the Soviet of People&apos;s Commissaries, with a view to enlarging the area of arable land, has decided that all land fit for sowing grain and which at present is not being cultivated by private individuals or farms shall be placed at the disposal of the State for the purpose of cultivation. Fields which cannot be cultivated this year will temporarily be included in the land belonging to the State. All the harvest will be placed at the disposal of the People&apos;s Commissariat for Food Supply.Soviet Russians Readiness for Peace. The following wireless message was sent from Smolensk on 2nd January. In connexion with the peace proposals made by Soviet Russia to Poland, the Russian papers published in Poland state that the Soviet Government, by its continual assertions of complete readiness to conclude peace, is having a great moral effect among the Left political groups in those countries, the Governments of which refuse to recognize Soviet Russia and are openly hostile to it.North-West.GeneralJudenich. [F.C.R. viii., p. 3.] On 21th January the British Comrnissioner at Reval reported [No. 2] that General Judenich had issued an order of the day on. 22nd January ordering the disbandment of the Russian North-West army.The Admiralty Weekly Appreciation&quot; for the Aveek ending 17th January [No. 57] had already noted that General Judenich was making arrangements for the chartering of sufficient tonnage to transport the remnant of his army from Esthonia.
SYRIA.Complaints against the French. On 25th January Admiral Webb reported front Constantinople [No. 75] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had spoken to him of the state of affairs in the regions which we had recently evacuated in Syria, Streams of complaints of brutal conduct on the part of the French were, he said, reaching the Government, He cited an alleged proclamation containing a warning that for any French soldier who was killed two of the inhabitants, taken indiscriminately, would be shot, and that the same penalty would be instantly incurred by anyone found with arms in his possession. He also spoke with great bitterness of Armenians gettino-hold of French uniforms.TURKESTAN.Bolsheviks and Turcomans. On 14th January the Viceroy of India transmitted a message from General Malleson, sent two clays earlier, reporting that there were indications that the Bolsheviks were seeking to conciliate the Turcomans, and that they had given them satisfactory assurances on the land question with a view to jDersuading them to renew cultivation. An effort to obtain recognition by lenient methods had taken the place of aggression and frightfulness.TURKEY.Khalll Pasha and Nuri Pasha. Telegraphing from Tiflis on 25th January [No. 49], Mr. Gruncly transmitted a message from Mr. Wardrop sent on the previous day from Baku. Mr. Wardrop said that Nuri Pasha and. Khalil Pasha were then at the&quot; latter place, and that he had received a message from Khalil through the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan. He declared that he had only worked with the Bolsheviks in desperation ; he was not himself one of them, and was ready to do anything we wished if he only had an assurance from His Majesty&apos;s Government that they would not permit the Turkish parts of Turkey to be distributed amongst foreign Powers.UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.Tlie proposed Credit to Europe. On 25th January Mr. Lindsay telegraphed [No. 57] from Washington saying that the measure which Congress was asked to pass was an authorization for the Grain Corporation to spend -f 150,000,000 in the purchase of wheat and [? other supplies] to be sold for relief purposes in Europe and the contiguous countries for cash or credit.On the preceding day the Foreign Office had telegraphed [No. 85] as follows to Mr. Lindsay, whose No. 57 was a reply to an earlier telegram : We learn that strong opposition is developing in Congress against the 8150,000,000 credit to Europe. All the British authorities concerned are busily engaged in London and Paris with a view to solving the physical difficulties presented by the shipping problem in connexion with credits which must be large, as well as devising methods to supply other essential requirements for which Congress has apparently not been asked to provide credits. His Majesty&apos;s Government are in fact leaving no stone unturned in the preliminary work of assuring co-operation between British effort and Congressional appropriation if approved.Mr. Lindsay in reply to this reported [No. 61] that the opposition to the proposed credit had come from an unofficial organization, the Republican Relieving Committee, by Avhich the policy of the Republican majority was directed. He&apos; had been told by a member of that Committee that a compromise would be reached and that not less than -$50,000,000 would be voted immediately. The Administration insists that something should be given without delay, and has but little doubt that supplementary grants will be made if the full requirements cannot be obtained at once ; it is not much alarmed by the new developments.
