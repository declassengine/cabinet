FOREIGN  COUNTRIES  REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.Internal Affairs.-OvL 7th October the Viceroy of India reported the receipt of advices that all was quiet in Kabul up to 21st September- A Government notice had been published in the Afghan Press inviting Indian companies to apply through the Afghan envoy at Simla for the following : (a) A contract for repairing the road from Dacca to Kabul; (b) a monopoly of the supply of motor and horse carriage transport for passengers on the same route ; (c) a monopoly of the fruit trade ; (d) the conditions under which sugar factories could be established in Afghanistan.Troops, consisting of two battalions of infantry and a regiment of cavalry, were reported to have left Mazar-i-Sherif for the Oxus, the Bokhara frontier.Jemal Pasha, with a mission including 20 Turkish officers, had arrived at Herat 17th September. Following orders from Kabul, they were being accorded courteous treatment, but the Herat authorities did not seem to welcome their advent.ALBANIA.Italian Attitude [F.C.R., xxvi, p. 2]. On 7th October Mr. Kennard transmitted [No. 452] the following summary of a note which he had received from the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs :  They state that it is impossible to consider on the same basis two situations, one founded on the armistice agreement and the other on a line which, even if it existed, could only be considered as a provisional military decision ; in fact a line of operations, as it was called by the Serbian Government on the first occasion on which its existence was maintained by the latter in official correspondence with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.The Italian Government further consider it an error to give a permanent character to a situation which cannot be considered as definite. The result of such procedure is generally to create difficulties instead of facilitating their solution.Finally, the Italian Government can in no way share the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding the Treaty of London and Albania ; if it were a question of referring to that treaty, it would be evident that in Albania the Serbian Government has occupied territory before the settlement of the question, while the Italian Government have evacuated it.The Italian Government, in the interests of peace in the Balkans and of the general pacification of the world, had made their proposals considering that the best way to remove any danger of conflict was to make it clear to the two nations and the Governments interested that the Powers, while awaiting the decision of the Conference, are of opinion that existing treaties must be respected and that a state of peace must be henceforward substituted for the methods of war. They consider that by these means it is easier to avoid the continuation of an undesirable and dangerous situation.On 1.8th October Mr. Kennard reported [No. 464] that the Italian Government, in view of the explicit assurances given by the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government, accepted the proposal for a district commission, but maintained their reservations regarding the general Albanian question.ARABIA.King Hussetn&apos;s Subsidy. Replying to Mr. Scotfs telegrams of 30th September [F.C.R., xxvii, p. 2], Lord Curzon instructed him, pending further instructions, to suspend payment of the subsidy or any part thereof.King Hussein and Idrisi. On 14th October [No. 356 A.P.] the Resident at Aden telegraphed that Captain Fazluddin had reported the receipt by Idrisi of a letter from King Hussein and Sherif Abdulla asking for an alliance.
From the personal point of view Iclrisi completely niistrusted King Hussein and his sons, who, he thought, would prove a veritable scourge if they secured their ends. But he was willing to make a complete sacrifice of &quot; possessions and lives &quot; to secure protection and peace for the sacred cities ; and, with that object, desired to come to an understanding with the King, though he was of opinion that it could only be secured by^the removal of the latter. Before answering the King&apos;s letter he wanted to know the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to an alliance between them, and further whether, in the event of a desire being expressed for such an alliance, they would arbitrate between himself and the King and guarantee the faithful observance of the resulting agreement. He further wished to know whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would like him to mediate between Ibn Saud and King Hussein ; and, if so, whether they would take part in the negotiations and guarantee the result. He also wished to know whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would like him to help Ibn Saud against Mecca in the event of a failure to achieve or carry out such settlement.AUSTRIA.The Plebiscite. On 13th October, Colonel Peck reported [No. 38] from Klagenfurt to the Conference of Ambassadors&apos; that the result of the plebiscite in zone A ;was as follows : 22,025 votes for Austria and 15,278 for Jugo-Slavia, and that the majority therefore for Austria was 6,747 votes.On 15th October Mr. Bridegman telegraphed [No. 389] from Vienna that he had received a note from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informing him that Jugo-Slav troops were entering zone A with the evident intention of contesting the results of the . plebiscite. One battalion of the 45th infantry regiment had occupied Rosegg, another had been sent to Ferlach, and three battalions with artillery were moving on Bleiburg.The Austrian Government, being resolved both to maintain its rights and to observe its obligations under the Peace Treaty, was bound to protest warmly against the action of the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government. In view of the enthusiasm in the area, acts of violence were to be feared, and in the interests of peace and order the Govern-ment must insist that the troops be withdrawn and the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government required to respect the plebiscite and the decisions of the Allied Powers.Next day Sir Alban Young in turn reported [No. 315] from Belgrade that he had learnt from the Secretary-General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that orders had been sent to the authorities in zone A to hand over the administration to the Plebiscite Commission on tbe understanding that the safety of pro-Jugo-Slavs was assured. The Jugo-Slav troops would be placed at the disposal of the Commission or withdrawn when so desired by the latter. He added confidentiaUy that the troops re-occupied the zone without the consent of the Central Government. Another Minister, however, had told one of his colleagues confidentially that the Government had to make a &quot;gesture &quot; in order to quiet the Slovenes.On the same day, 16th October, Lord Derby telegraphed to Colonel Peck [No. 1210] that the Allied representatives at Belgrade had been instructed by the Ambassadors&apos; Conference to inform the Jugo-Slav Government that their conduct was regarded as being in direct -contradiction to the treaty of St, Germain, and to request them to take immediate measures for the withdrawal of their troops.On 18th October Sir Alban Young reported [No. 318] that he had informed Lord Derby that, accompanied by the French Charge d&apos;Affaires, he had that morning made the representations indicated in his telegram of 16th October, and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had replied as follows : On 15th October the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government gave orders to competent - authorities (1) To declare to the Plebiscite Commission that (? the entry of) royalist troops into the plebiscite zone has no other (? object) than to afford aid and protection to our population and to (? our) authorities against possible acts of vengeance on the part of the opposite party. They will (? withdraw from) the plebiscite zone, together with our administration, in measure as the Plebiscite Commission itself finds the security of our population and of our authorities (? assured).
(2) To conform with the request of the Plebiscite Commission regarding the transfer of (? forces) of the administration of the plebiscite zone ; to undertake to this end the necessary measures in agreement with the Commission ; to protest against all the abuses committed to our prejudice in the plebiscite zone, (? seeing that) the unfavourable result of the poll to the Serb-Croat-Slovene Kingdom can only be attributed to these abuses.According to yesterday&apos;s reports the above-mentioned orders were being put into-execution.This answer, Sir Alban Young added, had been already prepared and much of it had appeared in the Press. The Minister for Foreign Affairs drew special attention to the date of 15th October, on which the orders had been given.BALTIC STATES.Aland Islands [F.C.R., xxvii, p. 4]. -On lith October Mr. Ramsay telegraphed from Stockholm [No. 278] that a private telegram to the Dagens Nyheter reported that, at meetings held on the previous day at 26 different places in the Aland Islands, the Aland Diet was charged to forward the following resolution to the council of the League of Nations : The people of Aland, gathered together at meetings of all the communes of the islands, have received with confidence the opinion of the commission of jurists approved by the Council of the League of Nations that the Aland question is of an international (? character), and that the Alanders should be granted the right of self-determination. The people of Aland hereby again give expression to their unanimous desire to decide their future dependence by a general plebiscite. They also feel convinced that, as it is inconceivable to continue to live under Finland, whose policy of coercion has stirred the feelings of all Alanders, the plebiscite in question will take place without delay, and that the Aland Islands question will be thereby solved in accordance with the demands of right and justice.Telegraphing from Helsingfors on 15th October, Mr. Kidston reported FNo. 636] that the refusal of the Alanders to prepare electoral rolls and to co-operate in the execution of the autonomous law had caused uncertainty as to whether the provincial assembly could meet on 1st December, the date fixed by law. The Finnish Govern-in en t had therefore introduced a Bill empowering the President to summon the Aland Islands legislature and executive at a date to be fixed by him once the elections had been held.BULGARIA.The Prime Ministers Visit to Western Europe. On 7th October Sir Herbert Dering telegraphed from Belgrade [No. 133] as follows : The Bulgarian Prime Minister, prior to his departure, granted an interview to many journalists, and explained the nature of his journey, which was to reopen normal foreign relations for Bulgaria. The details of his visits to London and Paris were fixed, and he hopes to arrange for a journey to Belgium, Czecho-Slovakia, Poland, Rumania and Jugo-Slavia. He emphasized the necessity for personal relations with foreign countries. At my suggestion the Prime Minister stated that one of his principal objects was to attract foreign capital to Bulgaria to develop production and the exploitation of its mineral wealth.Whilst the capital tax had created some alarm abroad, be would try to convince foreigners that the Bulgarian Government could guarantee the safety of capital. The law was designed to tax capital used for speculation and not that used for production. He added: &quot; We shall pass laws guaranteeing productive capital belonging to foreigners.&quot;CHINA.Abrogation of Russian Considar Rights [F.C.R., xxvi, p. 7]. Sir Auckland Geddes reported [No. 678] from Washington on 5th October that he had been informed by the Assistant-Secretary  of State that the United States Minister at
Peking had been instructed to discuss with his colleagues by what action the extra-territorial rights of Russian subjects in China should be protected. The Assistant-Secretary had told the Chinese Charge d&apos;Affaires that the United States Government regarded the action of the Chinese Government in striking at the political rights of Russians in China as suggesting not only that they were acting as the tool of the Bolshevik leaders in Moscow, but that they were aiming at the whole structure of foreign extra-territorial rights in China. He had added that it was iu consequence incumbent on China to establish a Government and courts of justice of such a character as eventually to inspire all foreigners resident in China with complete confidence in their administration.Telegraphing [No. 134] from Peking on 15th October, Mr. Clive reported that the Corps Diplomatique had considered it advisable to address a note to the Chinese Govern-ment to enquire whether they would confirm in writing the assurances made verbally to foreign representatives that the measures taken by them under their mandate were to be considered as a temporary arrangement pending future settlement with a recognized Russian Government, and not as a permanent derogation to Russian rights under their treaties. The note also suggested that in view of the effect of the mandate on the interests of other Treaty Powers the Chinese Government might be able to discuss with the Corps Diplomatique the means of tiding over the practical difficulties which would otherwise arise.Tibet. On 14th October Mr. Clive at Peking was informed [No. 323] by the Foreign Office that the India Office had telegraphed to the Indian Government to the following effect : At the. end of July, an inter-departmental Conference, which had been attended by Sir John Jordan, had considered the question of Tibetan policy. The recommendation of the Conference, as the only practicable course, was to obtain, if possible, an assurance in writing from the Chinese Government that China would not attack Tibet; such assurance to be formally communicated to the Tibetans. The belief was entertained that Mr. Alston, on his return to Peking, would be able to obtain such an assurance. The proposal to send a British officer to Lhasa had been dropped, in view of the Indian Governments opinion on the point of promising arms, but as some modification had been introduced by Colonel Bells expressed willingness to proceed in charge of the Gyantse-Lhasa Survey,- without any decision having been taken on the arms question, the Indian Government was authorized, subject to seasonal conditions being favourable, to despatch this officer at once. His general instructions would be to deal sympathetically with the Tibetan request for assistance, but he would have no authority to promise arms or ammunition. His mission would be subject to the Charge d&apos;Affaires at Peking raising no objection. H Mr. Clive concurred, he was requested to communicate his reply to the Indian Government.GREECE.M, Venizelos&apos;&apos; Administration.- On 6th October Mr. Russell reported from Athens [No. 246] that he had received a letter, signed by 10 members of the executive committee of the opposition, containing a reasoned indictment of M. Venizelos&apos; administration. They stated that he had been placed in office by M. Jonnart, the High Commissioner of the Powers, in 1917, and since then had governed in defiance of the constitution and of the assurances of the High Commissioner, who had promised an amnesty and not reprisals. They now demanded a freely-elected constituent assembly. They made no request for intervention, but begged to transmit their letter to His Majesty&apos;s Government.A similar letter, Mr. Russell added, had been addressed to the French Legation, and copies left at the United States and Italian Legations.Russian Refugees in Serbia [F.C.R., xxvii, p. 11]. On 7th October Mr. Russell was informed [No. 181] that the necessary arrangements might be made, in conjunction with the High Commissioner at Constantinople, for transporting the Russian refugees from Salonika to Serbia, as the terms of the Serbian Government had been agreed to.MEXICO.,FelixDiaz.-Mr. Cummins reported from Mexico on 9th October [No. 220] that Felix Diaz had. been- captured and was being exiled from the country. The republic was- now completely pacified.21-3 B
PERSIA.Financial Aid by Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In reply to the telegram [No. 490] of 30th September, in which the Foreign Office transmitted a message expressing the willingness of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to make an immediate advance to the Persian Government of 350,000L, current royalties for 1919-20, Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 678] on 10th October that the Persian Government accepted the offer with pleasure. The constant demands of the Commander of the Cossack Division for more money had occasioned considerable financial embarrassment, and the offer had come.just in time to relieve the situation. Should the present rate of military expenditure continue to be necessary, the needs of the administration would be met for about two months. In the hoped-for removal of the danger of invasion it would last longer.POLAND.Vilna and Marshal Pilsudski.-0a 11th October Sir Percy Loraine telegraphed [No. 921] from Warsaw as follows : I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs this evening what information he had as regards the actual situation at Vilua. He thereupon translated to me the substance of a telegram which he had received from General Zehgowski and other members of a Regency Commission formed there, of which the following are the main points : (1) The Commission has assumed control of &quot;middle Lithuania&quot;; this State consisting of the territory between the Foch line and the eastern frontier of Lithuania as fixed by the Lithuanian-Bolshevik treaty.(2) Its object is to safeguard the right of the self-determination of this region.(3) It is suggested that the Polish troops which are still on the middle Lithuanian territory should be removed from it.(4) It is requested that all natives of middle Lithuania serving in the Polish army should be released therefrom and allowed to return.(5) They undertake to guard the western frontier against the &quot; Kovno Govern-ment&quot; and hope that the Polish troops, remembering their brotherhood in arms, will ward off any aggression from the eastern frontier.(6) They are willing to discuss the matter with the Polish Government.The Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out that the tone of the message was that of one constituted Government communicating on equal terms with another, that there was no question or even suggestion of union with Poland, that the signatories were practically all natives of Vilna, and that most of them were known to be federalists as regards Lithuania and Poland. His Excellency told me that the League of Nations Commission had been in Vilna since Saturday evening, and that it was endeavouring to secure an agreement between this Regency Commission and the &quot; Kovno Government.&quot; In his opinion this inight offer a way out of an otherwise impossible situation, and might indeed, if successful, provide a workable basis for solving the whole Polish-Lithuanian difficulty.He said he thought it might be advisable to send delegates to discuss matters with these people, if only to act as a restraining influence and- prevent them from doing something irretrievably foolish. I begged him to reflect again before doing so, for I feared that such a step would be regarded as plain evidence that the Polish Government had connived at the whole performance. He concurred, in the force of this argument and said that he would wait.He informed me that MM. Witos and Daszynski Avould be back to-morrow morning and that a Cabinet Council would then approve a declaration, which he was drafting, whereby the Polish Government would dissociate itself entirely from this action and state that it (? kept; absolutely by its demarcation line with Lithuania.On the following clay Lord Derby reported from Paris [No. 1193] that the Polish Minister had officially informed M. Berthelot that his Government assured the French that everything in their power would be done to bring the troops to reason.   They &quot; deeply regretted General Zeligowskfs action, and entirely disavowed it.In a telegram [No. 928] dated 13th October, Sir Percy Loraine stated that he and the French Minister had together presented a note to Marshal Pilsudski, who in his reply remarked that the Allies had made no notification of their intention to annex Vilna to Lithuania during the 15 months that the Poles had occupied that town ; and
then went on to say that if he had followed the rules of war Vilna would have been occupied during the recent military operations. Not. wishing to do this, he sought a means of avoiding the difficulty thereby created, and Only succeeded by inflicting considerable additional fatigue on his soldiers, thousands of whom came from the neighbourhood of Vilna. When these enlisted he promised them&apos; that they would have complete liberty, after the conclusion of peace, to decide the fate of their country. Some of those to whom this promise was given had died in the defence of Poland and their own country. Must he tell the rest that they had no country, that they were outlaws, that Poland had deceived them and driven them out ? The Allies having decided that Vilna was the capital of Lithuania, this would be the exact truth ; but it would be a very bitter thing for him to have to say it.A Government could not be dishonoured by a disavowal, and it was open to the Government to abandon these unfortunate people to their fate. Were he to do so he should regard himself as personally dishonoured. Vilna was his native place, and he should go there abandoning his position as chief of the State and Commander-in-Chief. As a plain citizen among his soldiers and his fellow countrymen, he would give his life, if necessary, to fulfil the personal promise he had made.Sir Percy said that the speech was evidently unprepared, and that it was impossible to question the speakePs sincerity.On 16th October Lord Derby telegraphed [No. 1208] a summary of a note received from the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, in Avhich the latter gave the substance of a telegram he was sending to the French Minister at Warsaw.The French Government shared the - wish of the British that their two Ministers should continue to act together, and the French Minister would be instructed to act in concert with his British colleague ; and it was thought best that the two Ministers should be left free to form their own judgment.The present situation was as follows : The occupation of Vilna and General Zeligowskbs insubordination had been disavowed by Poland and her Ministers abroad ; but Marshal Pilsudski was unwilling to join in the disavowal and had resigned.In regard to the main question, the view of the French and British Governments was that its solution should be left to the League of Nations, which had been invoked by both Poland and Lithuania.As to Marshal Pilsudski, he was free to act as he liked, and the two representa-tives in Warsaw should abstain from any interference. There wras no reason for thinking that he would be long out of office, as he was the only statesman fit for the presidency7 ; he would resume power when the question had been settled by the League of Nations.RUMANIA.The Bessarabia Treaty. Lord Derby sent the following telegram [No. 1200] from Paris on 14th October : The Conference of Ambassadors has received a reply from the Rumanian Minister stating that his Government are prepared to sign the Bessarabia Treaty provided that the following two modifications are made : (1) Para, 1 of Article 7 regarding the Kilia arm of the Danube to be omitted, and the question to be referred by general agreement to the Conference on the Status of the Danube.(2) The addition of the words &quot; non prevus&quot; after the word &quot;details&quot; in Article 9.As regards amendment No. 1, the Rumanian note makes no mention of embodying the stipulation regarding the Kilia mouth in a letter to be addressed to the signatory Powers on the signature of the treaty.Having called the attention of the Rumanian Legation to this omission, they have to-day furnished me with a draft letter to the following effect: &quot; When the question was discussed in London in May 1920, the Danube Conference had not yet been convoked. According to the understanding then arrived at, it was laid down that the question of the Kilia mouth should be settled by the Danube Conference. The Rumanian Government still adhere to this point of view and consider that the Conference of the Danube, which is at present sitting in Paris, is competent to deal with this question of the Kilia mouth.&quot; 21-3 C
You will observe that this draft varies considerably from that enclosed in your despatch No. 1815. I shall be glad to learn whether you consider it equally acceptable. General Mance points out that, failing the agreement regarding the Kilia mouth at the Danube Conference which Rumanians could block, the status quo would, according to the new Rumanian draft, be maintained ; i.e., the Rumanian Government would evade the obligation which they contracted as the result of the discussions in May, which virtually assured the placing of the Kilia mouth under the Danube Commission.Amendment No. 2 appears to modify considerably the sense of Article 9, but the Rumanian Minister assures me that it has been discussed in London and accepted in principle.   I shall be glad to know whether this is the case.I reminded the Rumanian Minister that his Government had undertaken to embody in an exchange of notes the assurances given respecting the protection of French and British interests in Bessarabia. He tells me that such an exchange of notes has already been effected with the French Government and that the -omission in the case of His Majesty&apos;s Government was due to an oversight. He has now communicated to me the following draft : -&quot; The Rumanian Government undertakes to pay direct to the British Government, on behaR of the British landowners in Bessarabia whose property has been expropriated in virtue of the Rumanian expropriation law, compensation which shall represent the real value of the expropriated property.&quot;The amount of this compensation shall be fixed by common agreement by the two Governments in an equitable manner and without taking into account the rules laid down by the Rumanian expropriation law.&quot;I shall be glad to learn whether its text is acceptable to His Majesty^s Government.M. Take Jonesku left to-day for London and wiU, therefore, be in a position to discuss these points if required.The Rumanian Legation have notified&apos; the Conference of Ambassadors that they are prepared to sign the Central European Frontiers Treaty and the New States Treaty at the same time as the Bessarabia Treaty.RUSSIA.Exchange of Prisoners [F.C.R. xxvii, p. 9].-On ;14th October Lord Curzon telegraphed to Mr. Kidston at Helsingfors [No. 229] as follows : The Soviet Government has now replied to our proposal for the exchange of the remaining British prisoners, which it wishes to do on the Finnish frontier. The reply states that &quot;the Russian Government is in a position to deliver the English prisoners very soon. It will communicate direct with the British Minister (at Helsingfors), who must be represented on the Finnish frontier by a person empowered to give a receipt for the British subjects delivered. With reference to the Russian prisoners in England, the Russian Government expects the delivery of Mr. Babushkin&apos;s party to meet the first consignment of British prisoners on the Finnish frontier.&quot;Please approach the Finnish Government immediately and enquire whether it will agree to the arrangements proposed, and will permit transit through Finland of the Babushkin party. The names of the party and the date of their arrival in Finland will be telegraphed as soon as possible. The first party will not exceed twenty.UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.The Goal Strike in Great Britain. On 16th October Sir Auckland Geddes was informed [No. 799] that the outbreak of the coal strike had entailed the following provisional measures, which were essential to prevent irreparable injury to the social and economic life of this country : (I) Since there is no reserve of bunker coal at British ports, and no prospect^ of our being able to replenish current stocks, it will be impossible to provide bunker coal in the United Kingdom for any vessels other than those performing services essential to the national interest, (2) At Gibraltar, Malta, Egypt, Sierra-Leone&apos; and the Atlantic Islands it will probably be necessary to impose restrictions on the supply of British bunker &quot;coal to all vessels, in view of the great importance of conserving stocks at these depots.
Sir Auckland was instructed to inform the United States Government of these-proposed measures, emphasizing the extreme gravity of the crisis with which we were -confronted, and explaining that every effort consistent with the national safety would he made to minimize the delay and inconvenience to United States shipping. It was hoped that these steps, imposed by necessity, would not cause the United States Government to withhold bunkers to British vessels in the United States ports, and that he would be able to enlist the good offices of the United States Government in facilitating the shipment of coal to bunker depots abroad, thereby minimizing the-restrictions referred to above.Two days later Sir Auckland Geddes telegraphed as follows [No. 712]:  In reply to my communication the Assistant-Secretary of State, in the absence of the Secretary of State, informed me that the United States Government would do everything they could to assist. He expressed the hope, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government would likewise do what they could to give special facilities for bunkers in case of any individual ship which the United States Government might bring to our notice. I replied that he might rest assured that His Majesty&apos;s Government woiild do everything it could to (? minimize) the disturbance caused to ship niove-ments by the coal strike consistently with the performance of its first duty to bring the country through its difficulties; and that if he would bring to my notice any case that arose in which he felt that an unreasonable course was being followed, I should be pleased to examine it with him, and to take any action that seemed possible or useful in the circumstances.
