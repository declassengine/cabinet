FOREIGN   COUNTRIES   REPORT.ARABIA.King Hussein and Khalid. On 2nd February the British agent at Jeddah reported [No. 13] that it was stated that King Hussein had offered to confirm Khalid as Emir of Khurma if he would repudiate Ibn Saud. This was a result of the termination of hostilities, which apparently was due to the failure of lbn Saud to send the expected support, combined with dissension amongst the followers of Khalid.Hodeidah. On 7th February the Resident, at Aden telegraphed [No. 11] that Hodeidah had been occupied by Idrisi, and that his representative, Syed Mustafa, had taken over the charge of the internal administration from the local committees to whom Fazludclin had handed it over.   So far no disturbances had been reported.ARMENIA.Relief Works. On 5th February Colonel Stokes telegraphed [No. 32] from Tiflis as follows : An Armenian named Deroyan, formerly working for the Near East Relief, and well thought of by them, who is continuing relief work under Bolshevik auspices, has come to Tiflis to beg us and the Americans to continue relief. He states that there are in concentration eamrjs 30,000 refugees at Alexandropol, and 20,000 at Karaklis, besides many thousands scattered about, that the whole country is impoverished, and by 1st March 100,000 people at Alexandropol will be starving unless relief arrives.In the half of Armenia held by the Turks American relief continues. Stocks may last another two months, after which the Americans, I understand, will cease work unless the Turks enable them to purchase supplies at Erzerum. The Turks are showing signs of intentional curtailment of relief work and are making increasing-demands on relief supplies for their troops.In the Bolshevik half of Armenia, the Armenian Bolsheviks in power have so far displayed moderation, have committed no excesses, and have permitted relief work to continue at Erivan and Karaklis, even allotting 50,000,000 roubles for relief at Erivan. They have officially written to the American Near East Relief, begging them to continue the work and thereby promising protection. They offer the same to Harcourt. I regard the guarantees offered as reliable, but the danger lies in the possibility of the present moderate men at Erivan being replaced by extremists.After discussion with Deroyan, Harcourt, and Ehaatissian, I recommend relief in form of foodstuffs and clothing be sent, and that to ensure its proper distribution I be authorized to. form a committee with Doctor Ussher, who is working at Erivan independently of the Near East Relief, as president. As a member Khaatissian will be useful here, and others can be found to work in Armenia. Harcourt will not be fit to work for another month, when it will be easier to judge the desirability of his going to Armenia. As the object is to save lives, and in order to obtain the best results, I further suggest that the four British organizations for Armenian, relief co-ordinate their efforts.Food cannot be bought in Georgia for export, and the transport to Armenia of supplies landed at Batum will not be feasible unless oil fuel for trains is also provided, as Georgia is running a greatly reduced train service on coal.Note comnplaining of Turkish Troops. On 7th February Colonel Stokes reported. [No. 36] that a note, dated 18th January, from the Armenian Government to Angora -complained of the complete devastation by Turkish troops of the district of Alexan-dropol and the province of Ears accompanied by murder, rape, and deportation. The note asked Angora to put an end to all this hy withdrawing the troops from the region named.Angora replied refusing to withdraw, and stating that a similar declaration would be made at Moscow by the Turkish delegation.
Zanrevzur -Telegraphing from Tiflis on 27th January [No. 26], Colonel Stokes reported that Zanrevzur was said to have declared itself an independent state, under the G-government formed by the late Armenian Minister of War, Terminassian. also known as Reuben Pasha.Bolshevik Commissars replaced. In Iris telegram [No. 26] of 27th January, i-Colonel Stokes also reported that Russians or terrorist Armenians were graduaRv replacing such Bolshevik commissars as had hitherto displayed moderation. He added that officers of the Armenian army, commissioned and non-commissioned,&apos;were -being deported to Russia, where they served in the ranks.THE CAUCASUS.Georgia and the Bolsheviks [F.C.R., xxxv, p. 3]. With reference to his telegram of 20th January, Colonel Stokes reported [No. 24] on 27th January that the following were the chief points in the reply of the Georgian Government to the Bolshevik note : (1) The release of non-Georgian agitators on the understanding that they left Georgia forthwith. (2) A refusal to recognize the existence of the communist party, who were bent on the destruction of Georgian independence. (3) A refusal to entertain the demand for the dismissal of the Georgian commissioner at Batum. (4) A refusal to pay compensation for the steamship Principe which had escaped from Poti. (5) Permission for trains with supplies to save Armenia from starving, to run from Azerbaijan, but no Georgian oil trains to be allowed to run, so long as they -are not returned. (6) The Bolshevik mission to be treated on the same lines as other missions, provided it behaves like the others in conformity with international usage. (7) The cpiestion of the Bolshevik representative taking part in the Georgian-Armenian frontier settlement on the same standing as the representatives of those two -countries, to depend on the reply from Moscow as to whether Armenia is considered an independent state, or as part of the Russian republic. In the former case Russia is not affected ; but in the latter case Georgia will accept the suggestion.CHINA.General Situation. On 2nd February Sir Beilbj&apos; Alston telegraphed [No. 57] from Peking in regard to the general political situation in China, He said that efforts to promote reunion continued on the part of the central Government, but its bank-ruptcy and powerlessness rendered its efforts all but hopeless. The rivalry between Chang-Tso-Lin at Mirkden and the other military leaders, including the Premier, -continued to dominate the situation in the north. In the south the only provinces which definitely adhered to the Southern Federation were Yunan and Canton. Sun-Yat-Sen&apos;s scheme for proclaiming a southern federal republic, with himself as president, was prevented by the opposition of the Canton provinces under General Ohen-Chiung-Min [F.C.R., xxvi, p. 7]. The other southern provinces were awaiting events.-Revived rumours of a monarchical restoration had resulted from the desperate -situation.*   ESTHONIA.New Cabinet. On 26th January Mr. Louergan reported [No. 6] from Reval the following appointments in the new Esthonian Cabinet: M. Konstantin Pats - - -   Prime Minister.M. A. Piip        - Minister for Foreign Affairs.M. Johann Kukk -. - -   Minister for Trade and Industry.M. Major-General Soots - - -   Minister for War.M. Heinrich Bouer - Minister for Education.M. Karl Einbnnd - Minister of (word omitted).M. Berrihard Rostfeld - Minister of Agriculture.M. Jaak Reichmann - Minister of Justice.M. Gustav Westel - -   Minister of Finance.
FRANCE.Relations with Poland.- Lord Hardinge reported [No. 79] on 5th February that tbe President of the Council had expressed a desire that His M.ajesty&apos;s Government should know all that had passed between him and Marshal Pilsudski. They had discussed the measures to be taken in the event of an attack on Poland by the Bolsheviks, but nothing new had been settled. The French would hand over to the Poles certain military material now in Poland, and they would maintain their military :mission. France&apos;s attitude was purely defensive in support&apos; of its friend Poland.. They had also discussed some commercial cases affecting French interests in Poland,, and the possibility of a commercial agreement on the lines of most-favoured-nation: treatment. Beyond this he had recommended the Marshal to come to terms with Lithuania in regard to Vilna, and to cultivate better relations with Czecho-Slovakia.GREECE.Invitation to a Conference. On 26th January Lord Hardinge informed [repeated&apos; to F.O., No. 60] Lord Granville that the following telegram was being addressed to-his French colleague by M. Briand, as president, of the conference in Paris ; and that he should at once concert with his French and Italian colleagues in executing the instructions therein contained : As president of the conference in Paris, I request you will inform your British and Italian colleagues of the following decisions which have to-day been adopted hy the Supreme Council, and that you will concert with them in bringing these decisions to the notice of the Government to which you are accredited, inviting the latter to-furnish an immediate reply in order that the conference may be in possession of their-answers before breaking up at the end of the week : (1) A conference of allied representatives as well as those of the Turkish and Greek Governments has been summoned to meet in London on 21st February to discuss a settlement of eastern questions.(2) The basis of such a conference shall be the treaty of Sevres already signed by the Powers and by Turkey, subject to such modifications as may have been necessitated by the passage of events.(3) The invitation to the Turkish Government shall propose as a condition that Mustapha Kemal or a qualified representative of the Government at Angora should be included in the ^Turkish delegation.(1) That the Greek Government be similarly invited to attend.On the following day Lord Granville reported [No. 37] that the President of the-Council bad asked him to telegraph that the Greek Government accepted the invitation to the London conference and would be represented by himself ; and to add that he had expressed unofficially and not as a (group undecipherable) his surprise at the invitation being extended to Kemal. The British Prime Minister had stated publicly that it was not possible to negotiate with Kemal, who was a rebel ; and the Greek Government were convinced, especially after the news just received of (group: undecipherable) Etem Bey and the desertion of some 2,000 Turks into tbe Greek lines, that Kemal was a mere bogey.27?e Prime Minister and others on the Constituent Assembly.  On 3rd February Lord Granville telegraphed [No. 52] as follows : The President of the Council made his promised speech to Parliament yesterday explaining why the Chamber had been declared&apos; a Constituent Assembly. He put forward the same arguments as he had used to me; but mentioned, besides the-question of the irremovability7 of judges, the revival of the Chamber of May 1916 as one of M. Venizelos&apos; revolutionary acts, ratification of which must be refused by the new Chamber ; he also said that certain modifications of the constitution were necessary in order to conform with the provisions of the treaty of Sevres regarding the protection of minorities, and announced that the treaty would be presented to the Chamber to-day. He concluded with the words &quot; under the aegis of her great allies, and thanks to the glorious efforts of the Hellenic army, Greece will see her struggle for civilization, of which she has been for all time the herald, crowned wrih success.&quot;M. Stratos then spoke in exactly the same sense, but mentioned the provisions of the other treaties concluded at Paris, besides the treaty7 of Sevres, which required alterations in the constitution.   He argued that a &quot; Constituent Assembly &quot; was in.
the programme of all the anti-Venizelos candidates and that (? the electors) gave a clear mandate for it.General Danglis, leader of the Venizelists, insisted that the Chamber was revisionist and not constituent; he declared that the Liberal party offered all their support to the Government to help in its efforts to safeguard the advantages gained by the treaty of Sevres.If the Government persist, in making the present Chamber declare a revival of the Chamber of May 1916 illegal, they will get into a hopeless mess, as such a declaration will presumably invalidate all that Chamber&apos;s acts, including the ratifi-cation of the treaty of Neuilly. When I pointed out this to the President of the Council on 18th January he declared that, according to certain precedents, no act of international interest would be affected.Telegraphing again on 8th February, Lord Granville reported [No. 68] that on the previous day the Chamber had voted itself by acclamation the &quot; Third Constituent Assembly of Hellenes at Athens.&quot;Neib Cabinet. On 7th February Lord Granville telegraphed [No. 63] the following list of the new Cabinet: M. Calogeropoulos - - President of Council and Foreign Minister.M. Tsaldaris - - Interior and Communications.M. Theotokis - - Justice.M. Gounaris - - War.M. Rhallys (younger) - Marine.M. Protopapakis - - Finance and Supplies.M, Zaimis   - - - Public Instruction and Public Assistance.M. Baitadjis - - Agriculture.M. Mavromichalis - - National Economy.&apos;    LIBERIA.Negotiations xcith the United States.-0n. 1st. February the Consul at Monrovia reported [No. 1] that the President of the Republic, accompanied by the two Liberian commissioners and a secretary, had left Monrovia on 28th January by a Spanish steamship for the United States to complete negotiations with the United States Government for financial assistance to Liberia.PERSIA.Retirement of British Troops [F.C.R., xxxv, p. 5]. Telegraphing [No. 66] on 27th January, Mr. Norman referred to his telegram [No. 17] of Sth January [F.C.R., xxxiv, p. 6] with a desire to modify the impression likely to be given by his remarks on the Bakhtiaris, in which he was regarding their attitude during the war, when, only two bad remained faithful to us, ah the rest having sided with the enemy. Tentative proposals for co-operation with us, should the Persian Government go down before the Bolsheviks, had now been put forward by the Khans. The proposals implied the transfer to the Bakhtiaris of so much of Persia as might be saved from the Bolsheviks. The Khans were not yet prepared to accept the responsibility for Teheran, but declared that with financial support from us they could arrange to hold Ispahan and South Persia on our behalf. Mr. Norman did not approve of these proposals, as they would mean exposing a great part of Persia to oppression and exactions which in the end would incline the people to welcome the Bolsheviks. The plan would also put a stop to any attempts to reform Persian administration. Such a measure, therefore, in Mr. Norman&apos;s opinion, should only be entertained as a last resort if the British were actually driven out of Teheran.POLAND.Relations with France. See above under &quot;France.&quot;RUMANIA.Rumania and Russia [F.C.R., xxxiv, p. 7]. The following is a translation of ah intercepted wireless message from M. Chicherin to M. Take Jonescu, dated from Moscow, 7th February : The Russian Government who, since the beginning of the pourparlers respecting the conclusion of a treaty of peace between Russia and Rumania, that is, during more
than a year, have given proof of the most conciliatory spirit and of an unshakeable determination to put au end to all differences between our two countries and to arrive at a solid and durable agreement with Rumania, have decided to meet the wishes of the Rumanian Government and to accept the proposal contained in your radio of 31st January, received by us on 4th February. Though the Russian Government rather regretted the fresh delay caused by the convocation of a preparatory consulta-tion to precede the regular conference between our two Governments, &quot;they have decided to yield to your wish and to agree to your proposal that we should indicate a town to which a delegate of each side should proceed, in order to discuss together the programme of the Conference ultimately to be held. The Russian Government have appointed as delegate with this object Maxim Maximovitch Litvinoff, member of the college of the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, and likewise plenipotentiary representative of the Russian Republic at Reval, who has been furnished during his stay at Moscow with all the instructions necessary for bringing to a satisfactory conclusion the consultation with the Rumanian delegate. The Russian Government therefore suggest that Reval should be chosen as the seat of the negotiations during this preparatory consultation, seeing that it would be inconvenient for the Russian representative in present circumstances to leave Reval, while to the Rumanian representative it is a matter of indifference what town on the Baltic littoral he proceeds to. Our representative is already on his Avay to Reval and we should consider it highly desirable in the interests of both parties that there should be no delay in starting the proposed consultation.RUSSIA.Message from M. Chiehei-in. On 5th February the following message was sent from Moscow by M. Chicherin : The Russian Government has duly acquainted itself with the draft of the trade agreement and the various proposals and suggestions connected therewith which were transmitted by the British Government through M. Krassin.   We are glad to ascertain that as regards the clauses of the trade agreement itself there exist no such profound divergencies between the two Governments which would not admit of adjustment through further discussion between M. Krassin and the competent British department. The xorincipal obstacle to the signature of the agreement is, however, the preamble which the British Government desires to amplify and to enlarge Avithout proper negotiations beyond the limits of the basis that Avas 111x11113113- agreed to by the exchange of notes of 30th June and 7th July.    Regarding this question, the Russian Government is of the same, opinion as the British Government as to the fact that this basis expresses the principles of mutual obligation in the most general and vague form, leaving ample room for misinterpretations, misunderstandings and possible mutual complaints and frictions.   Seeing that the Russian Government desires to attain as clear a definition as possible of these objections and to remove all ambiguity from the relations to be established between both countries, with the purpose of creating a real solid basis for their friendly relations and of elaborating the conditions for bringing about peace in the Fast, so desirable to both parties as well as to the rest of the world, these considerations have impelled the Russian Government to insist upon political negotiations without which the agreement will hardly produce the desired results,   A glaring example of the misunderstandings, false conclusions and unjust complaints resulting from unclear definitions of the June-July agreement as well as from misrepresentation and false statement of the real facts can be found in the notes of the British Government of 2nd and 9th October and must be reminded of in the following brief recapitulation.   It was untrue that the Russian Government was sending troops to Persia.   As a matter of fact, as soon as the remnant of the White Guard forces in Enzeli had been done with, the Russian military and naval forces evacuated Persian territory and since then did not enter the same.   The fact of tbe liquidation of the White Guard forces in Enzeli was a necessary act of self-defence of the Russian Republic and can in no case be considered as directed against British interests.The assertion that Bolshevik troops were despatched to Asia Minor was further completely untrue, and can only serve as an example of the British Governments misinformation as to the real happenings in the Near East. The Russian Government was not, and * is not, engaged in any military conspiracy against British interests in Asia Minor; it has not threatened, and does no^thi-eaten, the invasion of Khorasaiid,
arid lias not created in Tashkent any organization intended for attacks upon British territory or interests. we must also emphatically protest against the assertion that the Russian Government has brought about the revolution in Bokhara, ami that this revolution pursued the aim of an attack against British territory and interests seeing that as a matter of fact the liberation of the working masses of Bokhara was their own work, and that these working masses in liberating themselves had and have no aggressive designs against any other people or country.It is also untrue that the Russian Government attempted to conclude a treaty with Afghanistan with the aim of inciting a tribal rising on the Indian frontier.As to the attempts of identifying the Third International with the Russian Government they have not more value than an attempt would have of identifying the Belgian Government with the Second International, which had its seat in Brussels, or the British Government with the international organizations having their centre in London, or with.the same Third International to which a British communist party is affiliated on a par with the Russian communist party.The Russian Government strictly adheres to the conviction that analogous misunderstandings and misinterpretations will be inevitable so long as both Governments will uot come together for an exhaustive discussion, and will not clearly and without ambiguity7 deline their mutual obligations and the limits of the reciprocal interests which both parties must refrain from violating.Although the British Government, contrary to our opinion, considered the mutual obligations of the June-July agreement as being already in force at the time of the above notes, it did not regard itself as violating this agreement when undertaking in the East as well as in the West hostile actions against the Russian republic in every possible direction. In the same countries in which your notes of 2nd and 9th October falsely attributed to the Russian Government hostile actions against Britain, it was in reality the British Government which conducted and is still conducting a policy of implacable hostility- against Russia. In Persia, British military forces rendered help and assistance to the Russian White Guard remnants which threatened the security7 of the Russian republic as well as of her ally the Azerbaijan republic ; and up to the present date British influence in Persia is directed towards preventing the conclusion between Russia and Persia of a peace treaty7 advantageous to both countries and containing nothing that would bring prejudice to any other country or which would involve any7 menace to them.In the Caucasus and Asia Minor the Entente Governments incessantly7 try7 to bring about actions threatening the security of Russia and Azerbaijan. British and other Entente agents are constantly7 attempting to incite rebellions in the frontier regions of the Soviet republics. The incessantly defiant and provocative attitude of the Georgian Government towards Russia would be impossible were it not backed by Entente diplomacy7. On the Black Sea, British as well as French vessels are attacking Russian ships or such of other nationalities which bring goods to Russian harbours, and tbe British destroyers such as the Invincible are lurking in neighbouring waters in order to conduct hostile actions against Russian trade and Russian shores.During the period when the working masses of Armenia had not yet thrown off the yoke of militarism and capitalism, the counter-revolutionary Dashnak Government that existed at that time, systematically opposed all the lawful demands of the Russian Government, and its action was rendered possible only by the approval of the Entente Governments.As to the Turkish National Government, no day7 passes without statements of the British press to the effect that Great Britain seeks to prevent the establishment of friendly relations between Turkey and Russia, and to drive the Turkish nationalist movement upon the.path of hostility against the Soviet republics, although without effect. Whereas the revolutionary movement of the toiling masses of Bokhara is remote from any aggressive intentions against Britain or any other country, we have documentary evidence, proving that the previous despotic Government of the Amir of Bokhara relied upon tbe support of British agents when preparing attacks upon Russian territory.The efforts of the British representatives are also known to us, which are aimed at inciting Afghanistan against Russia, although the Afghan Government, cognizant of its true interests, deliberately refuses to enter the path of hostility against the Russian republic.In all the western countries which are in some touch wdth Russia, Great Britain has invariably pursued the same policy of hostility against our republic.   The Polish 25-2 C
hostilities against Russia and Ukraine and the armed insurrectioii of the ex-General von iVrangel would have&apos; been impossible without the active help of the Entente Governments, the leading operations of Wrangebs troops would not have taken place without the help of the British fleet and without British coal, and the enormous quantity of British equipment and ammunition that was in possession of Wrangel shows how far the British Government was implicated in fomenting this counter-revolutionary insurrection against the Russian Government. Diplomatic action of the British and other Entente Governments opened the way to the transport of arms, and ammunition to Poland, a great part of which was of British origin ; and, for example, in the harbour of Dantzig it was British influence which in spite of the-opposition of the local workers compelled the ammunition to be unloaded and. transported.In the South of Bessarabia (sic) was incorporated to Russia by the British and&apos;, and the other Entente Governments without the knowledge of Russia and Ukraine.. Up to the present day the Entente press gives daily proofs of the continued hostile-activity of the British and other Enteute diplomacy7 aimed at inciting new foes and new hostile actions against the Soviet republics, thus undermining at the very root the possibilities of trade with tbe latter. So profound and strong is nevertheless the Russian Republics desire for peace and trade that, in spite of these facts, it remains by its decision of concluding with Great Britain the intended trade agreement, but it considers as necessary, at any rate, the introduction of the following amendment in the preamble. Seeing that the British Government has already declared its consent to the enumeration in the preamble of those countries in which the British Govern-ment engages itself not to undertake any hostile action against the Russian Interests, we demand that after the words &quot; especially iu Asia Minor, Persia, Afghanistan and India &quot; the following words should be inserted : -&quot; On the other part the Government of the United Kingdom wiU desist and refrain from undertaking or assisting any hostile action or propaganda in any form against the interests or the security of Soviet Russia in the above mentioned countries, as well as in the countries which formed a part of the former Russian Empire and which have now become independent states on the ground of the right of the peoples to self-determination, and will also refrain and desist from encouraging or supporting in any way hostile actions against Soviet Russia on the part of Japan, Germany, Poland, Rumania, Hungary, Czecho-Slovakia, Bulgaria, Greece, Jugo-Slavia, and will not interfere in Soviet Russia&apos;s relations with other countries or hamper these relations. The contracting parties reciprocally engage themselves to .respect the independence and integrity of Persia, Afghanistan and of the territory of the Turkish National Assembly.&quot;The recent judgement in the Sagor case makes it moreover clear to tbe Russian Government that the confirmation of this decision by a higher Court, or similar judgements with reference to Russian gold or goods, would render the trade agreement unworkable and would be therefore a lawful ground for its immediate automatic annulment, and that this point must be duly stipulated in the treaty.The Russian Government must also point out that in the new draft handed to M. Krassin, a stipulation has been inserted referring to the general debts of tbe previous Russian Governments, which was absent in the earlier drafts and which must be removed at all events. After reception of the British Governments favour-able answer as to the adoption of the above three amendments the definitive negotiations of M. Krassin with the British Government will be continued regarding the adjustment of some minor divergencies of a purely commercial character and regarding the signature of the agreement.TURKEY.Invitation to a Conference. On 26t.h January Lord Hardinge telegraphed [repeated to Foreign Office, No. GO] to Sir Horace Rumbold in the same terms as to-Lord Granville.   [See above under &quot; Greece.&quot;]On 7th February Sir Horace reported [No. S4] as follows : -The Minister for Foreign Affairs called last night to say that the Government-delegation to the London conference would start on 12th February7. The delegation would probably be headed by the Grand Vizier, and would include Osman Nizami and Reshid Pashas, respectively Turkish representatives at Rome and London. It was, however, possible that the Sultan might not be willing to let the Grand Vizier go
away at this juncture. The delegation would also include at least one secretary with -a perfect knowledge of English.The Minister for Foreign Affairs added that if Mustapha Ivernal persisted in. sending a delegation independently of the Government delegation, as to which point the Turkish Government are still awaiting a categorical pronouncement from Angora, he supposed that the two delegations would have to come to some understanding in London.I reminded the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the exact terms of paragraph 3 of the decision of the Supreme Council, and said that I had thought it well to refer the point to your Lordship in view of the attitude of the Angora Government,The attitude of the Angora Government referred to in the above telegram was shown in the following message addressed by Achmed Muktar Bey, styling himself Minister of National Defence, to the British, French, and Italian Foreign Ministers, which was transmitted by Sir Horace Rumbold [No. 71] on 1st February.Achmed Bey hastens to communicate to the said ministers the text of a telegram sent by the President of the National Assembly to Tewhk Pasha in reply to an invitation to take part in a conference in London on 21st February, which was transmitted by the Grand Vizier to the Angora Government: The National Assembly (? at) Angora, which is based on the will of tbe people, is the sole independent and legal authority having a right to discuss (group undecipherable) of Turkey. That Assembly alone can engage in discussions with foreign Powers in the name of the nation. The political group established at Constantinople has no legal political situation and has no right to call itself a Govern-ment, for such a claim is entireR contrary to the rights of sovereignty of the people. It follows all the more that this group cannot discuss the interests of tbe country with foreign Powers.You have a patriotic duty regulating your personal conduct by recognizing and proclaiming that the only legitimate authority having a right to speak in the name of the nation is the Government of the Grand National Assembly. The Powers are convinced that Angora is the seat of the only legitimate Government; they are slow to recognize this in fact, because they consider the existence of the interior group at Constantinople more useful for their interests.The Angora Government has declared on several occasions that its most lively desire is the re-establishment of peace and of tranquillity, but on condition that the rights of peoples are recognized. With these objects in view it declares its readiness to enter into peace pourparlers. If the Powers really intend to settle the eastern question according to the principles of justice and of right they should address themselves direct to the Grand National Assembly. An invitation in this sense will have the best reception from us.On 6th February Sir Horace transmitted [No. 82] a second message from the Angora Government, signed by Bekirsami, Peoples&apos; Commissary for Foreign Affairs in the Government of the Great National Assembly of Turkey: The delegation which will represent the Government of the Great National Assembly of Turkey at the conference to be held in London on 21st February will leave Angora at the latest on 7th February, and will proceed to Europe via Adalia and Brindisi.Owing to the length and difficulty of the journey, we fear lest the arrival of our delegation at its destination may be somewhat delayed. In that case we would be grateful if the Great Powers would be willing to postpone for a few days the proposed conference in order to enable our delegation to participate therein.
