FOREIGN  COUNTRIES   REPORT.THE BALTIC STATES.Attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to these States. Telegraphing on 25th September to the British representatives at Reval, Riga and Kovno, Lord Curzon informed them that the question of the Balkan states had been reconsidered in its broadest aspect. The autonomous existence of those states had already been recognized, but, the question of the de jure recognition of their independence could only be settled by the peace conference or the league of nations. In any such decision, however, the British Government might be relied upon to exert such influence as it might possess to secure the satisfaction of the legitimate aspirations of Esthonia, Latvia and Lithuania so far as should be consistent with a final and peaceful settlement in North East Europe.The British Government had been ashed if it could continue to supply military material and stores to these states. The reduction of the available stocks of material cou sequent upon the termination of the war and the shortage of shipping unfortunately rendered it impossible to continue these contributions : but this decision had been arrived at without prejudice to any action that might be taken by any other of the allied powers or by the powers acting in Paris as a whole. In the event, however, of the national liberties of these states being imperilled by Bolshevik invasion, the British government might be prepared to reconsider its decision in regard to the supply of war material.Similarly as regards the provision of credit it was impossible for the British Government to assume at this stage a financial responsibility which they have hitherto been unable to accept.The British Government consequently felt that it was not entitled to exercise any pressure on the free initiative of the Baltic states, whose governments must be at liberty to decide upon such action as might be most conducive to the preservation of their own national existence, It was for them- to determine with unfettered judgment whether they should make any arrangement, and if so, of what nature, with the Soviet authorities, and if, as seems to be in contemplation, they decided to act in unison, the effective control of the situation should be within their power.The Baltic Socialist Conference. On 25th September Sir Coleridge Kennard telegraphed [No. 489] the following text of the resolution passed by the Baltic Socialist Conference at Riga : Taking into consideration (1) That the war between Soviet Russia and. Esthonia, Latvia and Litliuania is a war of defence to which Soviet Russia has forced these states ;(2) That the world war, the Einnish civil war, and the war of Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania against the Soviet has considerably weakened these states ;(3) That the peoples of the Baltic, and especially the workers, oppose any military intervention in Russian affairs, as such intervention serves the objects of imperialism, arousing reaction, &amp;c. ;(I) That with the knowledge and approval of the German Government, the German and Ivolchak&apos;s Russian imperialistic and military circles desire to set up a reactionary Russo-G-erman alliance in the territory of Lithuania and Courland, which alliance would threaten both the inde-pendence of the Baltic states and the peace of the world ;(5) That the most important forces against that aUiance are the arms of the democracy of the democratic Russia which is coming to birth ;this conference of representatives, of the Social Democratic parties of Finland, Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, demands that the governments of those countries approve the peace proposals of the Soviet and agree to a peace which will guarantee the independence, security, and peaceful development of these countries.Telegraphing again [No. 496] on the following day  Sir  Coleridge Ivennard reported that the Finnish Social Democratic party had sent out a proclamation that &apos;
followed the same lines as the Riga resolution, in that, the party council had called upon the workers to make, peace demonstrations throughout the country, at which the following resolution should be passed : &quot; Considering the military expeditions planned by the imperialistic bourgeoisie against Soviet Russia Finnish Labour demands : &quot; (1) that the military operations against Russia be stopped ;&quot; (2) that Finland make immediate use of the peace proposal of the Soviet, andenter into peace negotiations ; &quot; (3) that the Finnish diet be summoned to decide conditions of peace.&quot;The. Dorpat Conference.-Telegraphing from Reval on 2nd October, Col. Tallents reported [No. 273] that the Baltic conference began at Dorpat on 29th September and ended on 1st October. Representatives of the three Baltic states and of Finland were present. A programme had been agreed upon which required-ratification within six days, and it was confidently expected that none of the four states would refuse it.It was agreed that Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should inform the Bolshevik Government that they were willing to enter upon preliminary peace pourparlers ; but the date of the first pourparler would not be fixed till the Finnish diet had given its decision, which it was agreed should be done by 23rd October.It was further agreed that self-determination, and as a consequence thereof the sovereign independence of Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania must be recognised by the Bolsheviks: the same right of self-determination must.be conceded to the Finns of the Archangel and Olonetz governments, and as far as possible to the Esthonian and Finnish inhabitants of Ingermanlancl. The Bolsheviks must further agree (1) not to make or encourage Bolshevik propaganda in any of the four states, and (2) to the fixing of a neutral zone whose administration should be organised by the Entente powers who were also to be asked to control, either directly or through the league of nations, the execution of any treaty that might be made.The four states also agreed that no one of them should consider a separate peace if, before the opening of negotiations, a military convention had been made between them.Latvia.Tension between Letts and Russo-German Forces. Telegraphing on 7th October [No. 15S] Mr. Tallents reported that the chance of avoiding an early outbreak between the Letts and the Russo-German forces appeared to be small as tension between them was on the increase.Lithuania.Resignation of Cabinet. According to a wireless message sent out from Nauen on 6th October the Lithuanian cabinet has resigned, and the President has entrusted the formation of a new one to Mr. Gaivanauski, the Lithuanian peace delegate.Lithuania and Poland. On 28th September Col. Tallents reported [No. 148] that Col. Ward had been informed by the Lithuanian Government that a document had come into its possession which afforded definite proof of the participation of Poland in an organization which had for its object the securing of an appearance o  spontaneous welcome for the design of annexing Lithuania to Poland. It was willing to send the document in question to either Paris or London.BRAZIL.Interned German Crews.-On. 7th October Sir Ralph Paget telegraphed [No. 1941 as follows :-&quot; I am informed by the Brazilian Government that all German crews interned in Brazil will be released on loth October, and allowed to proceed to any destination.&quot;The Brazilian Government will encourage any, who so desire, to settle on Brazilian farms.&quot;
ATHE CAUCASUS.Azerbaijan.Conversation with the Prime Minister. -Telegraphing from Tiflis on 2nd October [No. 49], Mr. Wardrop reported that he had had a conversation with the prime minister, Mr. Ussubbekow, of which he sent the following notes :  1. The whole of Trans-Caucasia looked to Great Britain for moral and material assistance in the creation of an independent life, and would do all she could to merit the confidence of His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. The rule of the Bolsheviks and that of the Denikinists were equally repugnant to the country, and there was not much to choose between the administrations ; they were about equally bad.3. Azerbaijan wanted to live and develop her people and resources : she only wanted-peace. As a proof of the liberal principles of his government, Mr. Ussebbekow had told him that he had both Russians and Armenians in his cabinet, and Russian and Georgian officers in the army : anyone who would serve the. country faithfully was welcomed, there was no fanaticism and the Moslem religion had ceased to be a factor in politics.4. Mr. Ussubbekow was willing to submit all questions relating to Armenia to arbitration. He said that quite recently 60 Moslem villages had been destroyed by Armenians.Georgia.Protest against General Denihins Measures. On 4th October Mr. Wardrop reported [No. 54] that he had received a protest from the minister for foreign affairs against the violent measures of General Denikin in Daghestan. The prime minister had begged him. to intervene.Daghestan.Reasons for the present Situation. On 5th October Mr, Wardrop reported [No. 61] that he had received a deputation of four natives of Daghestan, one of whom had recently been at the peace conference in Paris. They asserted, and Mr. Wardrop saw no reason for doubting the assertion, that the chief factor in provoking the present universal rising was the attempt made hy General Denikin&apos;s subordinates to force the iDopulation into the volunteer army. A contributory factor, they said, was the colonization of their countrymen under the old regime by the Cossacks, who had not behaved in a way likely to conciliate the natfve population.CHINA.Japanese reservations in regard to the proposed Consortium. -On 27th September Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 419] to Mr. Alston informing him that the Japanese Ambassador had communicated to him the information which he had promised to procure from Tokio as to the geographical interpretation placed by his Government upon the terms Southern Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia.His Excellency stated that as regards Southern Manchuria its northern boundary, as interpreted by the Japanese, might be drawn from the point at which the railway line from Changchung crossed the Lesser Sungari river. From this point the boundary stretched in an easterly and westerly direction on a line parallel to the main Siberian railway. This was the northern border of Southern Manchuria as understood by them. As regards Eastern Inner Mongolia, it was very difficult to determine the point at which Mongolia merged into Manchuria, and difficulties had occurred with the Chinese in regard to concessions claimed by them to be in Mongolia, while the Japanese alleged that they were in Manchuria. There was the same difficulty in drawing a precise geographical line as a division between Inner Mongolia and Eastern Inner Mongolia. However, the nearest definition which the Japanese Government could give me was the following : Mongolia, the Ambassador said, was divided into a number of groups or leagues and Eastern Inner Mongolia as interpreted by the Japanese comprised the greater portion of the four leagues that were nearest to Manchuria. These four leagues- were allied among themselves and constituted a quasi-independent district of their own. Their names were : Cherim-ment, Chosote-ment, Chouta-ment, and Sirimgol-ment.
oIn regard to this, Sir John Jordan telegraphed on 4th October [No. 532], Lord Ourzon&apos;s telegram having been repeated to him from Tokio.He said that it would have been simpler if the Japanese Ambassador had merely stated that Japan&apos;s claim included the areas assigned to her under the secret treaties with Russia with the addition of the western portion of the Selingol League territory. The territory of these leagues, Sir John said, had for the last five years been treated, for administrative purposes, as part ox China.He added that it would be remembered that when Japan extorted the treaty of 1915 from China she made a determined effort to get her claims in Southern Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia recognised, and succeeded &apos;to the extent of securing railway rights and some other things. The secret treaties, so far as he knew, had never been published or disclosed to China.The Interruption of the Tibetan Negotiations. On 27th September, Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 421] to Mr. Alston informing him that the Japanese ambassador (who, he said, evidently felt keenly on the subject) had spoken to him in regard to the charge made against the Japanese minister in Peking of having intervened to stop the negotiations proceeding between the British and the Chinese Governments about the boundaries of Tibet. The ambassador said that the Japanese minister in Peking had absolutely denied the charge; but other persons had been implicated. The ambassador assured him that his government would never have intervened in a question po entirely outside its province ; it was guiltless and. was pursuing its investigations in order to probe the case to the bottom.Conference of British Chambers of Commerce. On 26i.li September Sir John Jordan reported [No. 523] that at the beginning of November there would be a meeting at Shanghai of representatives of all the British Chambers of Commerce in China for the purpose of discussing among other things the bearing of currency, reform tariffs, and inland taxation on British commercial interests ; Anglo-Chinese co-operation; study of the Chinese language; and extraterritoriality. Sir John Jordan said that he had been pressed to attend the conference and was anxious to accept the invitation if Lord Curzon should see no objection to his doing so.CZ ECHO-SLOVAKIA.Commercial Relations with Germany. According to a wireless message despatched from Nauen on 6th October a delegation from the Czecbo-Slovak government is on. the way to Berlin in order to prepare for the resumption of commercial relations with Germany.FINLAND.General Situation.  On 27th September Sir Coleridge Kennard reported [No. 501] that he had been informed by the minister for foreign affairs that on &quot;the previous clay there had been a meeting between the Government and the representatives of the party groups which had considerably cleared the situation. The minister thought that the Government would be able to couut henceforth on the fuller support of the Socialists ; who, too, he thought, would not now actively oppose the maintenance of the status quo with Soviet Russia.The Dorpat Conference. Telegraphing on 2nd October Colonel Tallents reported [No. 273j that the allies would be asked whether they approved the Finns supporting the Baltic states.On 3rd October Sir Coleridge Kennard reported [No. 514] that the diet had been summoned for 18th October to consider the attitude of Finland, and that the minister for foreign affairs begged that before that date he might be informed whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would prefer Finland to act independently of the border states, maintaining the status quo with Soviet Russia, or to join forces with them.The Aland Islands.- On 1st October Sir Coleridge Kennard reported [No. 507] that he had been asked by the Finnish Government to convey an official&apos;protest against the settlement of, the Aland Islands question on the lines foreshadowed in M. Clemenceau&apos;s speech ; and that he had informed them that he felt sure that the Finnish representatives in London and Paris would be kept fully informed if any proposals for dealing with this question were really in contemplation. -so 2-2 B
On the following day he telegraphed [No. 511] the following summary of an aide-memoirs received from the Acting-Minister for Foreign Affairs :  The Swedish Government and Swedish opinion claim that the Aland Islands question should be settled by an international decision, alleging that the Finnish Government is unwilling to make any concession.This allegation is not in accordance with fact.On 11th December ] 918, the former Finnish Government received a note from the Swedish Government on the subject. When handing this note to the Finnish Government the Swedish Minister at Helsingfors emphasised that no urgent answer was expected. Availing itself of the delay desired by itself the Swedish Government subsequently applied to the allied Powers requesting their intervention and stating that the Finnish Government had left its note unanswered.There is ample proof, however, that the readiness of the Finnish Government to discuss the question was known to the Swedish Government. In a note handed to the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs on 6th June last, the Finnish Govern-ment, after dwelling on the reforms projected for the government of national minorities in Finland, expressed its readiness to negotiate with the Swedish Government.On 15th August (sic) the President of the Finnish republic confirmed the terms of a note that was handed to the Swedish Government by the Finnish Minister at Stockholm on 19th August. In this&apos; note the Finnish Government expressed its readiness to grant extremely large concessions to the Swedish point of view. By express desire of the Swedish Government this note was kept secret. In this note the Finnish Government expressed its readiness, provided the sovereignty of Finland was respected, to discuss measures that would conduce to a settlement satisfactory to both sides.Believing that the Swedish Government would act correctly the Finnish Govern-ment (in accordance with the desire of the Swedish Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Eden) kept the note secret. The Swedish Government, however, made (? further) representations to the Allies alleging that Finland refused to deal with the question.The aide-memoire then summarises the enactments in the Finnish Constitution of 17th July 1919, providing for local self-government for the administrative districts, and. for concessions to Swedish minority.   It continues :  In July last the. Finnish Government appointed a committee to examine the measures necessary to put these enactments of the constitution into effect. This committee lias proposed that larger districts for self-government, comprising several parishes, be created ; * the administration of these districts to be vested in an elected body of representatives. The Government would nominate a commissioner for a district on the proposal of this representative body. These districts would be as far as possible purely Swedish or purely Finnish. As regards the Aland Islands, the committee has recommended that the elected representatives should be allowed to choose and nominate their own commissioner. The Finnish Government would not send any prefect to the Aland Islands whose autonomy, therefore, would &quot;be complete-In another telegram [No. 512], sent on the same day, Sir Coleridge reported that when lie handed him this aide-memoire the Acting-Minister remarked that, rather than cede the islands, Finland would fight Sweden ; and that this feeling was reflected in the Press.FRANCE.Proposal for the Modification of the Treaty of Versailles. On 27th and 28th September, Sir George Grahame reported [Nos. 1010 and 1016] that M. Andre Lefevre, who had taken a leading part in depreciating the results obtained for France by the peace treaty, had laid before the Chamber a resolution inviting the Government to begin negotiations with the co-signatories of Versailles treaty for the modification of the treaty, to render effective the disarmament of Germany and her allies by the interdiction to manufacture certain war material, and the adoption of other measures considered necessary.The peace commission of the Chamber, however, had decided to substitute the following text for that proposed b3^ M Lefevre : &quot; The Chamber invites the Government to enter into negotiations with the allied and associated Powers with a view to rendering the disarmament of Germany and of
her allies effective by the prohibition of certain, war manufactures, and by all measures which ma)- be considered necessary.&quot;The Commission had thus accepted M. C]emenceau&apos;s stipulation that the motion should only concern the allies, and had, moreover, decided not to put the motion forward until after the ratification of the treaty.It was understood that M. Lefevre did not agree to the above modification, and still proposed to request the immediate discussion of his own motion in the Chamber on the 3.0th instant.. GERMANY.Order for the Evacuation of the German Forces in the Baltic States.  On 27th September Astoria reported [No. 1385] the following text of the ultimatum approved by the council of five which would, be &apos; despatched that day through Marshal Foch :--Aux tonnes d.e 1&apos;article XII de 1 armistice du II novembre 1918, lVVllemasnie a sousorit 1&apos;engagement suivant:&quot; Toutes les troupes allemandes qui se trouvent actuellement dans les territoires qui faisaient partie, avant la guerre, cle rAutriche-Hongrie, de la Roumanie, de la Turquie. doivent rentier immecliatement clans les frontieres de 1&apos;Allemagne, telles qu&apos;elles etaient au ler aout .1911.&quot; Toutes les troupes allemancles qui se trouvent actuellement les territoires qui faisaient partie, avant la guerre, de la Russie, devront egalement rentrer dans les frontieres de TAllemagne definies comme ci-dessus, des que les Allies jugeront le moment venu, compte tenu de la situation de ces territoires.&quot;A la date du 27 aout, le Marechal de France, commandant en chef les armees alliees et associees, a fait connaitre que la moment etait venu pour 1&apos;AUemagne d&apos; evacuer lesclits territoires et a mis le Gouvernement allemand en clemeure d&apos;y proeeder imniediatement.Par sa note du 3 septembre, le G-ouvernement allemand cherche a se soustraire a 1 &quot;engagement ci-dessus raprjorte, en alleguant des i3retextes cpie les Puissances alliees et associees ne sauraient aclmettre.Les Gouvernements allies et associes se refusent notaminent a aclmettre que le Gouvernement allemand puisse, pour decliner la responsibility qui lui iucombe, se retrancher derriere 1&apos;impuissance ou il pretend se trouver cTimposer l&apos;obeissance a ses troupes cles regions baltiques.Us invitent, en consequence, le Gouvernement allemand a proceder, sans aucun clelai, a 1&apos;evacuation cle toutes troupes allemandes, Etats-Majors et services compris dans les provinces baltiques. Le Gouvernement allemand clevra prendre egalement sans delai, les mesures necessaires pour faire rentrer, dans les limites prevues, tons militaires allemands, qui apres demobilisation, ont pris du service clans les corps russes organises dans lesdit.es provinces baltiques, s&apos;abstenir de toute autorisation et imposer rigoureusement rinterdiction d&apos;y prendre du service.L&apos;evacuation clevra etre entreprise immediatement et poursuivie sans inter-ruption.Les Gouvernements Allies et Associes font connaitre que jusqu&apos; a ce qulls aient constate que leur demands recoit entiere satisfaction ils ne prendront en consideration aucune ties demaucles actuellement soumises par le Gouvernement allemand, concernant le ravitaillement de 1&apos;Allemagne en vivres et en matieres premieres. Ils ont, en consequence, donne. 1&apos;iustruction de ne proceder a 1&apos;examen d&apos;aucune de ces demandes.En outre,, ies Gouvernements allies et associes refuseront toutes facilites finan-cieres, dont actuellement le Gouvernement allemaud profiterait ou qu&apos;il rechercherait aupres des Gouvernements allies et associes ou de leurs ressertissants.Si le Gouvernement allemand continue a ne pas remplir ses engagements, les Puissances Alliees et Associees prendront toutes autres mesures qu&apos;elles jugeront necessaires pour assurer 1&apos;execution desdites clauses cle 1&apos;armistice.In regard to this ultimatum the following wireless messages were sent from Nauen, the first on 30th September and the second on 1st October :  (1) In connection with the Entente note to Germany on the evacuation of the Baltic Provinces, the German Press declares that the Entente are fully aware of the efforts of the German Government to secure the withdrawal of the German troops
sdrom the Baltic Provinces.   Besides preventing the delivery of munitions, food and pay to the troops, the German Government have also prevented any further increase-of volunteers.   Furthermore, the German Minister for Defence, Noske, declared in his recent speech that he would have every man fired upon who should attempt to-reach the Baltic  Provinces.   Finally, the German Government decided to recall General von der Goltz, as he no longer had the troops sufficiently in hand to secure obedience to his orders.   The German Press doubts whether the German Government. is entitled to order the withdrawal of those Germans who, as individuals, have entered the Russian Army.   Such individuals are no longer bound by the operation of German military law.   The German Press hopes that the Entente, realising that the German Government are making efforts to cany out the Peace Treaty, will refrain from resorting to the threatened measures of compulsion, which would spell the ruin of Germany.(2) In discussing the Entente note in the Chief Committee of the National. Assembly, the German Minister for Defence declared that the German Government were making every effort to fulfil their obligations. The Courland frontier was closed to all troops. Count von der Goltz had been recalled. The German troops in Courland numbered no more than 20,000 men. Everything imaginable was being done to withdraw the rest of the troops. The chief difficulty was how to lay hold of some 3,000 men who had entered the Russian Army.Germany and the War. According to a wireless message sent out from Nauen on 2nd October, the programme of the committee of the National Assembly for investigating the origin of the war includes the following points : (1) To elucidate the events which led to the war after the Serajevo incident. This elucidation does not aim at fixing the guilt for the war but seeks to establish the external events which directly led to the outbreak of hostilities.(2) To investigate all the possibilities which existed for peace discussions and the reasons why such opportunities were not utilised by Germany. The following cases of such opportunities may be cited : The alleged peace feeler of Sir Edward [Viscount] Grey in 191.5, Mr. Wilson&apos;s offer of mediation in 1916, Helfferich&apos;s assertion of a chance of peace negotiations in the early part of 1917, the papal offer of mediation, the possibilitj&apos; of separate peace with Russia under the Tsar and M. Kerensky, SulzeFs mission, the peace pourparlers of Count Toning, the treatment of the lvaisers peace offer of 1916, the Reichstag resolution of 1917, and other proposals..(3) The employment of methods of warfare prohibited by international law. In this connection will be investigated the accusations brought against the enemy.*-(!) To investigate the economic war measures undertaken by all the belligerent countries in violation of international law.GREECE.Campaign against M. Venezelos. On 29th September Lord Granville reported [No. 422] that he had received a telegram from Constantinople asking whether he-could confirm information received from Smyrna, from which it appeared that large numbers of officers and men were involved in a movement in the Greek army against M. Venezelos.GUATEMALA.Ratification of the Peace Treaty. On 4th October Mr. Armstrong reported [No. 100] that two days previously the Government had ratified the treaty of peace,, which had been unanimously approved in the National Assembly.HOLLAND.Relations with Belgium. On 7th October Mr. Robertson reported [No. 1464] that -in the course of a conversation with the minister for foreign affairs, when he reminded him of a recent statement that it was not too late for the Belgian Government to-
approach, the Netherlands Government direct, the minister replied that the attitude of the Belgian delegates at Paris must first change and the negotiations there be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. When once the Paris negotiations were concluded, if the Belgians showed a more friendly spirit he would be quite willing to take up economic conversations at The Hague. He fully realized the necessity for re-establishing neighbourly relations with Belgium but the latter must do something to restore the confidence of Holland.ITALY:Flume. Situation, Proceedings in the Italian Chamber on 28th September centred round the question of an Italian- annexation of Fiume. Sir R. Rodcl reports that evening [No. 623] that Signor Tittoni in explaining the international situation for Italy resulting from the Paris negotiations, laid stress on the necessity for maintaining friendship with the United States of America. He stated that if France and Great Britain had recognised the Italian character of.Fiume, their attitude was conditional on the acceptance by the President of the United States of America of the formula recently drawn up. The President was still opposed to the annexation of Fiume which must remain a free city. Signor Tittoni held that Italy could not proceed to annex Fiume without the authority of the Conference. An annexation without the assent of the Conference would place them outside the concert of nations and might compromise what had already been gained elsewhere. He insisted that Italy must remain in close union with her Allies.The following day Sir R. Rodd reports [No. 624] that after a stormy sitting, at a late hour the Government secured a majority of 60 in a division of 356 members on an order of the day to the following effect : &quot; The Chamber solemnly re-affirms Italian (? annexation) of Fiume and confiding in the action of the Government passes to the order of the day.&quot;On 6th October [No. 637] Sir P. Rodcl reports that the Italian Government are undoubtedly doing their best to remedy a difficult situation.Parliamentary Situation. Telegraphing on 30th September Sir R. Rodd reports as follows [No. 6^7] : &quot; The Government decision in the present; critical situation has been to imme-cliately dissolve the Chamber, and a Royal Decree published this morning fixes the elections for 16th November and the convocation of Parliament for 1st December.&quot; The report addressed by the Government to the King points out that the profound internal dissensions (? make) it impossible for the present Chamber any longer to carry on its duties efficiently and only the sagacity of the new Parliament can settle controversies ailecting the national life which must now be referred (? to) the electorate.&quot; The mandate of the present Parliament in any case expires on 26th October, &quot;and it does not appear possible to count on securing the approval of the Peace Treaties before that date. But precedent and tradition in Italy establish that important Treaties may be approved by Royal Decree to be subsequently converted into law. If necessary therefore the Sovereign will be invited to give effect to the Peace Treaties.&quot;Serbian Troops in Montenegro. Sir R. Rodd telegraphs on 6th October, that the Italian Delegation in Paris has been instructed to contradict as entirely false a message dated from P-asee published in the Press to the effect that the Serbian Government had communicated to the Allied Legations, excepting that of Italy, a Memorandum alleging that Italy was preparing an attack on Serbian troops in Monte-negro. The Chiefs of the Naval and Military Staffs had given their assurance that nothing was being organised without their knowledge, and that the allegations were completely untrue.PERSIA.Anglo-Persian AgreemenL-Siv P.  Cox telegraphs  from  Teheran  [No. 665, 30th September], that in that place and in the Provinces the Agreement may be regarded as accepted by public opinion, and that Lord Curzon&apos;s speech of which a translation had been published had given unbounded satisfaction.   The only cause 2-2 C
for anxiety lay in the opposition which might come from several Russian elements. Among these are Starosselsky aud the Cossack Division, the Russian Legation, and the Bolsheviks. A report by the first-named to the Prime Minister, communicated by Sir P. Cox [No. 666, 30th September], paints a gloomy outlook based on Bolshevik menace. In commenting on this [No. 668, 1st October]. Sir P. Cox is of opinion that the Russian elements are relics of the old regime and live in hopes that Russia will come into her own again in Persia. The agreement with Persia is wholly opposed to their conception of Russian interests, and the hostility to the agreement, ascribed to Lenin and the Azerbijan Government, is really the expression of the views of. Starosselsky and his fellow workers. However, the Prime Minister has been greatly disturbed by this report and asks His Majesty&apos;s Government to recognise that it is in our joint interests to take speedy measures to make the position safe, both as regards the Bolshevik menace in the Northern Provinces, and in regard to the Cossack Division whose kwalty can now be no longer relied upon. Sir P. Cox considers the outlook is undoubtedly disquieting and supports proposals for certain movements of troops.POLAND.General von der Goltz marching on Dwinsk. On &apos;7th October Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed from Warsaw [No. 301] as follows : &quot;A member of the Polish Foreign Office, who may be considered quite reliable, informed one of my staff yesterday that the Polish military authorities had ascertained by means of their aeroplanes and General Intelligence Service that General von der Goltz&apos; army was marching rapidly on Dwinsk in two columns.&quot;     7RUMANIA.New Ministry. On 27th September Mr. Rattigan reported [No. 419] that a Ministry had been formed by General Vaitoiauu, who was minister of Avar in the late cabinet. The greater number of the new ministers were generals on the active list.This came as a great surprise as the King had asked Mr. Maniu if he would form a government, and the latter had accepted subject to the support of Messrs. Take Jonescu and Averesco, which was promised.The appointment of General Va;toianu was attributed to the influence of Mr. Bratiano ; and, Mr. Rattigan added, the opposition leaders were furious and talked openly of revolution.RUSSIA.The Soviet Government.Mr. Chicherin and Peace. A message from Donlevine, Moscow, addressed to the Chicago Daily News, intercepted on 29th September, gives an account of an interview with Mr. Chicherin. The Russian Commissary for Foreign Affairs stated that Soviet Russia was willing to conclude peace on the following conditions : (1) Cessation of military operations on the territory of the former Russian Empire.(2) The raising of the allied blockade.(3) Assumption by Soviet Russia of the imperial debts.(4) Mutual amnesties and simultaneous demobilization of all (? states within) the limits of the former Russian Empire.On being asked what guarantees the Soviet Government would give (? not to interfere in) the internal affairs of other countries by means of propaganda, Mr. Chicherin replied : &quot; The peace treaty imposes mutual responsibilities. If for instance we concluded peace with America, we should be willing to guarantee not to carry on propaganda in the United States. Our policy is, as soon as peace&quot; is concluded, to establish economic relations with all countries, and such relations Avith the United States would be especially valuable. We are willing to grant concessions to foreign capital on very liberal terms, but the Allies ignore these offers, preferring to hope for our downfall.&quot;
The Aland Islands. The following is a summary of a note addressed to the governments of France, Great Britain, Italy, the United States, Japan, Sweden,, and Finland, and sent out from Moscow hy wireless on 3rd October : The Russian Soviet Government has learnt from the press service of the Entente wireless stations that the representatives of the five chief allied and associated Powers at Paris are about to decide the question of assigning the Aland Islands to Sweden or Finland. As there exists no treaty between Russia and Finland which fixes the frontiers of the latter country, the Aland Islands cannot be assigned to Finland except by such a treaty. Still less can these islands be handed over to Sweden without the participation of Russia. Further, since the geographical position of the Aland Islands at the entrance of the Gulf of Finland makes their fate closely connected with the needs and interests of the peoples inhabiting Russia, the Russian Soviet Government declares that the Governments of the five great Powers, by making an arbitrary decision as to the fate of the Aland Islands are tisurping an authority which does not belong to them and are disposing of this territory without the knowledge and without consulting the wishes of the peoples whom this question concerns and of the working masses whom this decision affects. The Russian Soviet Government will not recognise any agreement relative to the Aland Islands concluded without their participation, and protests emphatically against the arbitrary action of the Governments aforesaid, and declares that it will regard any decision of this kind as.null and void.The Omsk Government.American Supplies.  On 27th September Mr. 0&apos;Reilly reported [No. 798] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had been notified by General Graves that the latter was advising his government that no further suj)plies should be despatched to Siberia till such time as energetic-measures should be taken by Admiral liolchak to remove Ivalmikoff and Semenoff. There were 14,000 rifles in Vladivostock which were bought in America for gold and were now urgently required at the front, but General Graves had placed an embargo on them.Anti-Government Movement. On 1st October Mr. 0&apos;Reilly reported [No. S08a] an interview between Mr. Preston, late consul at Ekaterinburg, and some persons engaged in the anti-government movement in Vlaclivostock. These persons assured him that there was no possibility of agreement with Admiral Kolchak, who was regarded as having helped Bolshevism in Siberia by the arbitrary methods of his government. They assured him that the army was prepared for their coup cVetat, and that if it failed nothing could prevent the spread of Bolshevism.Turkestan.Conditions in Merv. The Viceroy reported on 5th October [No. 13551] that information had been received from Colonel Malleson to the effect that the population of Merv was starving and that there was a rigorous enforcement of conscription of persons of all ages, who were immediately sent east where great disturbances were reported.SERBIA.A Neiv Ministry. Mr. Athelston Johnson reported on 6th October [No. 336] that Mr. Trifkovitch had succeeded in forming a Ministry. Mr. Trnmbitch and General Hadjitch retained their portfolios of Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of War. Mr. Protitch became Minister of the Interior, and Doctor Koroschetz Minister of Commuications. No members of the Democratic Club had joined the Ministry.Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 338] Mr. Johnson reported that Mr. Trifkovitch had submitted the names of the Ministry he had formed to the Prince Regent, who declined to accept the proposed Government as it was not representative, and its majority could not conceivably attain double figures in the Chamber.His Royal Highness has now sent for M. Pavlovitch, the President of the Chamber, and requested him to form a coalition Government.It is hard to see how he can succeed unless the two powerful personalities of M. Protitch and M. Pribitchevitch mutually agree to stand clown. 2-2 D
SWEDEN.Labour Congress at Washington.-On 27th September Sir Esme Howard telegraphed [No. 1364] that according to press reports the following were leaving Sweden to take part in the labour congress at Washington : Lindquist, von Sydow, Sjoborg, and von Koch. They would be accompanied by the following experts :   Huss, Edstrom, Johansson and Hasselgren.He added that, according to the press, Lindquist would not take part in the proceedings unless Germany were represented.TURKEY.New Ministry. On 3rd October Admiral de Robeck reported [Nos. 1907 and 190S] that the grand vizier had resigned on 1st October ostensibly on grounds of health, and that a new ministry had been formed as follows : Grand Vizier - -        Ali Riza Pasha.Shaykh-ul-Islam     - -        Ibrahim Haidari Zade.War - - -        Kyutchuk Jemal Pasha.Marine - -        Salis Pasha.Foreign Affairs - -        Rashid Pasha.Interior - -        Damad Sherif Pasha.Public Instruction - -        Said Bey.Public Works        - -        Abouk Pasha.Justice       - - -        Mustafa Effendi.Council of State     - -        Abdurrahman Shereef Bey.Mines and Forests - -        Hadi Pasha.Finance - -        Tewfik Bey.Commenting on the personnel of the new cabinet, Admiral de Robeck savs :   &quot; The new cabinet is composed of men who are respectable but who have been in the main nationalist and in some cases also sympathisers with the C.U.P.&quot; The new Grand Vizier has not been conspicuous in political life for some years past &quot;though he was Minister of Marine for some time subsequent to the armistice. He is known as an honest and fairly distinguished soldier rather than as a politician.&quot; The Shaykh-ul-Islam is part. Kurd, part Arab, and has Pan-Islamic leanings with a special eye to Mesopotamia. s&quot;The Minister for Foreign Affairs held office under Tewfik Pasha after the armistice. He has C.U.P. associations, and may be expected to give a free hand to the strong Nationalist group in his ministry.&quot; The most significant new elements are the Minister of War and the President of the Council of State. The former was up to his neck in the nationalist movement at Konia in the early days of the Mustapha Kemal movement. He was recalled, and I made a point of insisting that he should not be allowed to return. The new President of the Council of State is a stalwart of the old guard, identified with the C.U.P., and subsequent attempts to rally the national efforts.&quot;The most significant retention is Abouk Pasha, who is a Circassian. He was-supposecl to be the member of the late Cabinet most in sympathy with the Mustapha Kemai movement.An imperial rescript to the new Grand Vizier enjoins measures to end the dissension prevailing in the country and the earliest possible convocation of Parliament: otherwise it is colourless. The Sultan was most reluctant to let Ferid go, but has made the best of a bad job and seems to have accepted the Ali Riza. ministry as a Cabinet of transition, but. it is too soon to judge of this.&quot;Adrianople. Admiral Webb reported on 7th October [No. 1929] that he had been informed by his French colleague that the Vali of Adrianople had been evicted, by the Nationalists who had taken over the government of that place.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Anqlo-TPrench Agreement. On 28th September Lord Grey reported [No. 1392J that he had been informed at the embassy that the feeling in the State Department in regard to the Anglo-Persian agreement was very strong: it was regarded as a virtual annexation of Persia, and they thought that the move had been kept dark, intentionally.   The subject had not attracted much attention in the press.
LATER INFORMATION.AFGHANISTAN.Afghan Propaganda. The Viceroy of India reports [No. 13379] that he has been informed by General Malleson that most misleading versions of the peace treaty have been published everywhere by the Afghan officials. It is generally accepted that the Government of India sued for peace when the victorious Afghan army had penetrated far into India; and that it was granted a six months&apos; armistice on condition that the subsidy should be doubled, large territorial concessions with gifts of money and arms granted, the complete independence of Afghanistan from all control and its suzerainty over frontier tribes recognized, in addition to the freeing of Indian Makonrmedans from alleged British oppression. There were persistent reports of Afghan propaganda in Eastern Persia and in Russian territory, and the result of this agitation has been the strengthening of local opinion in regard to the probable temporary character of the peace.PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.The following reports have been received : Peace with Germany. W.C.P. 1315V A Note from the German Delegation, in reply to the Allied Note, dated 11th September, agreeing to accept the interpretation of Article SO of the Treaty of Peace demanded by the Allied and Associated Powers, and declaring paragraph 2 of Article 61 as invalid.YV.O.P. 1319.
