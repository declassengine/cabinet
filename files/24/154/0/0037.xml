FOREIGN  COUNTRIES   REPORT.ARABIA.Hejaz.Rumour of proposed Attack on Hejaz. Telegraphing [No. 22] from Jeddah on 15th February, in reply to an enquiry from the Foreign Office, Major Batten said that King Hussein and Emir Ali had both impressed upon him that it was reported from a reliable source that the Wahabites were planning an attack on a large scale at the beginning of the pilgrimage. They pressed for an arbitration being arranged with Ibn Saud before the pilgrimage. Major Batten said that he had no precise information beyond the statements of the King and his son, and the report that Khalid had proceeded to Riadh.Aden.Sheikh Nasir appeals for Protection. On 9th February the Resident at Aden telegraphed [No. 12] as follows: Sheikh Nasir of Sheikh Said has appealed for protection against the aggressions of the kaimakan of Moza, who acting on behalf of the Imam has occupied two places belonging to him. He asks for ammunition to resist the kaimakan.Sheikh Said is outside this protectorate and we are under no obligations to protect Sheikh Nasir. We, however, claim all land, including Sheikh Said, which was included in the Anglo-Turkish convention of 1913, and which the Turks undertook not to alienate to a third power. I am of opinion that we should refuse to interfere at present, but take up the question of guarantees regarding Sheikh Said with the Imam when an opportunity offers. Unless you have any special orders I propose to refuse to assist.ARMENIA.Boghos Nubar Pasha appointed Plenipotentiary.-Telegraphing [No. 89] from Constantinople on 9th February, Sir Horace Rumbold reported that he had received a letter from the heads of the three Armenian relief communities requesting him to inform Lord Curzon that, at a plenary sitting held on 4th February, the national councils, as the sole representatives of all Armenia of the former Ottoman Empire, decided to nominate Boghos Nubar Pasha as their plenipotentiary, for the purpose of pleading the Armenian cause with the allied Governments, and especially of defending their national interests at the forthcoming conference in London, together with such other persons as he might himself select.Sir Horace added that he had replied that he was transmitting their request to His Majesty&apos;s Government, at the same time reminding them that the invitations to attend the conference, issued in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Council, were addressed only to the Greek and Turkish Governments, and, through tbe latter, to the nationalists at Angora,Relief Works [F.C.R., xxxvi, p. 2]. On 10th February Colonel Stokes was authorized to form a committee as suggested in his telegram of 5th February, and to do anything within his power to assist relief.Armenian Conference in Rome. Colonel Stokes telegraphed [No. -10] on 11th February that M. Khatissian would leave Tiflis two days later for Rome, to attend a conference of Armenian representatives in Europe, as representative of the former Armenian Government. His idea was that Rome had been chosen as the place of meeting because the Italian Government was believed to be the allied Government in closest touch with the Turkish nationalists, and it was hoped to secure the best terms for Armenia through the Italian Government. M. Khatissian thought it probable that Bolshevik Russia would unofficially be kept in touch through them with any negotiations which might be taking place.Georgia and Armenia. See under &quot; Georgia.&quot;
AUSTRIA.Demand by the Italian Minister for transfer of Objects of Art. On loth February Mr. Lindley sent the following telegram [No. 43] : The British representative on the Vienna section of the Reparations Commission, having learnt that the Italian Minister had demanded that the objects of art mentioned in the Italian-Austrian agreement of 4th May should be handed over to the Italian legation to-day, raised the question yesterday in a special meeting of the commission called by the American delegate and himself.The commission decided by a majority that it should address a letter to the Austrian Government, forbidding the transfer, as being contrary to the decision of 22nd November of the Reparations Commission in Paris.The Italian representative, who was the only delegate to vote against the proposed letter, claimed an appeal to Paris, which he had technically the right to do, and which automatically prevents any action of the commission pending the result of the appeal. The British, French and American delegates then decided to write a joint letter to the Austrian Government as representing the principal creditor countries Tinder &quot;advances to Austria.&quot;The Italian charge d affaires called on me yesterday evening, and asked me to stop the British delegate sending in the letter, lie declared that it was inadmissible for an individual member of the commission to address the Austrian Government, and maintained that Italy had a perfect right to demand the objects under a treaty which Austria, had freely signed. If the British delegate did not sign the letter, the other two would not insist, as they had been only led into it by him.1 replied that I had no authority over the British delegate. I quite saw the. inconvenience of individual members addressing the Austrian Government, but it seemed to me that they had been forced to do so by the action of the Italian delegate. I understood that the validity of the agreement of 1th May was sub judice at Paris, and I could not understand the action of the Italian legation in the circum-stances. Nor could I agree with the view that any treaty between Austria and another Power automatically withdrew the subject of the treaty from the scope, of the Vienna, section. If that view prevailed, any one Power could force Austria to part with all her assets, and the work of the Reparations Commission would, become impossible. I did not accept the statement that the French and American delegates had been led on by the British delegate, and would let the matter drop if he did. The)&apos; were all three entirely at one. The British delegate had merely done his duty, and I could not intervene in any way.The French Minister is exceedingly angry with the Italian, and declares that the agreement of 4th May was a direct violation of article 195 of the treaty of Saint-Germain. It is notorious that the agreement was only signed by the Austrians under the threat that supplies would be stopped via Trieste.The whole incident is a good example of Italian methods in this country ; and demonstrates the necessity for the existence of some inter-allied body to prevent Austria being completely pillaged to the detriment of the co-operation of the Powers.Telegraphing [No. 46j again on 16th February, Mr. Pindley expressed the opinion that it was advisable that steps shordd be at once taken in Paris if it were wished to uphold the principle that the Austrian Government might not cede property without the previous sanction of the Vienna section. He had learnt that, in spite of the joint letter of the American, British and French delegates, the Italian charge d&apos;affaires was bringing the strongest pressure to bear on the Austrian Govern-ment to hand over the objects in question to the Italian embassy. And this pressure -could not be withstood by the Austrian Government unless either the section as a whole or the allied representatives forbade the transaction.Austro-Russian Trade. On 17th February Mr. Lindley reported [No. 48] that the Minister.-for Foreign Affairs had informed him that on the previous day he had seen the &quot;Russian Soviet representative just back from Moscow. The latter had stated that all parties were unanimously against further war and in favour of every effort being made to re-establish the economic situation in Russia. AVith this object commercial missions would be sent out and M. Krassin would return to London. To which he had replied that the Austrian Government would be only too glad to see the resumption of Austro-Russian trade, but were determined to allow no Bolshevik propaganda under the cloak of trade. The Soviet representative had then given the most binding assurances in this respect.
AUSTRIA.Demand by the Italian Minister for transfer of Objects of-Art. On loth. February Mr. Lindley sent the following telegram [No. 43] : The British representative on the Vienna section of the Reparations Commission, having learnt that the Italian Minister had demanded that the objects of art mentioned in the Italian-Austrian agreement of 4th May should be handed over to the Italian legation to-clay, raised the question yesterday in a special meeting of tbe commission -called by the American delegate and himself.The commission decided by a majority that it should address a letter to the Austrian Government, forbichding the transfer, as being contrary to the decision of .22nd November of the Reparations Commission in Paris.The Italian representative, who was the only delegate to vote against the proposed letter, claimed an.appeal to Paris, which be had technically the right to do, and which automatically prevents any action of tbe commission pending the result of the appeal. The British, French and American delegates then decided to write a joint letter to the Austrian Government as representing the principal creditor countries under &quot; advances to Austria.&quot;The Italian charge cbaffaires called on me yesterday evening, and asked me to stop the British delegate sending in the letter.

If the British delegate did not sign the letter, the other two would not insist, as they had been only led into it by him.1 replied that I had no authority over the British delegate. I quite saw the. inconvenience of individual members addressing the Austrian Government, but it seemed to me that, they had been forced to do so by the action of the Italian delegate. I understood that the validity of the agreement of 4th May was sub judice at Paiis, and 1 could not understand the action of the Italian legation in the circum-stances. Nor could I agree with the view that any treaty between Austria and another Power automatically withdrew the subject of the treaty from the-scope, of the Vienna section. If that view prevailed, any one Power could force Austria to part with ; all her assets, and the work of the Reparations Commission would become Impossible. I did not accept the statement that the French and American delegates had been led on by the British delegate, and would let the matter drop if he did. They were all three entirely at one. The British delegate had merely clone his duty, and I could not intervene in any7 way.The French Minister is exceedingly angry with the Italian, and declares that the agreement of 4th May was a direct violation of article 195 of the treaty of Saint-Germain. It is notorious that the agreement was only signed by the Austrians under the threat that supplies would be stopped via Trieste.The whole incident is a good example of Italian methods in this country ; and -demonstrates the necessity for the existence of some inter-allied body to prevent Austria being completely pillaged to the detriment of the co-operation of the Powers.Telegraphing [No. 46] again on 16th February, Mr. Lindley expressed the opinion that it was advisable that steps should be at once taken in Paris if it were wished to uphold the principle that the Austrian Government might not cede property without the previous sanction of the Vienna section.&apos; He had learnt that, in spite of the joint letter of the American, British and French delegates, the Italian charge cbaffaires was bringing the strongest pressure to bear on the Austrian Govern-ment to hand over the objects hi question to the Italian embassy. And this pressure -could not be withstood by the Austrian Government unless either the section as a whole or the allied representatives forbade the transaction.Austro-Russian Trade.

With this object commercial missions would be sent out and M. Krassin would return to London. To which he had replied that the Austrian Government would be only too glad to see the resumption of Austro-Russian trade, but were determined to allow no Bolshevik propaganda under the cloak of trade. The Soviet representative had then given the most binding assurances in this respect.-
The Minister for Foreign A if airs liad added that he had gathered the impression that the Soviet Government was in no position to continue war and really meant to abstain from it. -BULGARIA.King and Premier to visit America. Sir Arthur Peel reported [No. 28] from Sofia on 21st February that the provisional Congress had adopted a resolution authorizing the Premier to visit America accompanied by King Boris.He added that the Echo de Bidgaria had published an interview between the King and the correspondent of an American newspaper at present in Sofia, in the course of which both his Majesty and the Premier had expressed the hope that a visit to America would take place in the autumn.CHILE.Insecurity in the Northern Provinces. On 16th February Mr. Vaughan telegraphed [No. 21] from Santiago as follows : In view of reports from the consul at Antofagasta as to the insecurity of life and property in the northern provinces owing to tbe latent unrest which is at present being-aggravated by the closing down of works, although the position is for the moment calm, I have again made strong representations to the Chilean Government,They assured me that they realized the position, and that troops were gradually-being drafted there.The consul suggests that, in view of the continuation of labour troubles from Callao southwards, at least one of his Majesty&apos;s ships should always be kept on the coast for such emergencies.In my opinion, if such a measure were adopted the vessel ought to be permanently-posted north of Valparaiso.Recognition of the Bolivian Administration. On 10th February Mr. Vaughan reported [No. 13] that the Chilean Government had recognized the Bolivian, administration.FINLAND.Resignation of two Ministers. The following telegram [No. 26] was sent by-Mr. Kidston from Helsingfors on 18th February : Tbe Minister of Commerce has just called to say that he and the Minister of&quot; Justice have resigned owing to disagreement with the Government policy of intro-ducing an amnesty bill. The President has asked the Minister of Commerce to remain in office until his return from the British fair, but his Excellency wished to know whether I thought in the circumstances he should go to the fair at all. I ventured to say that I thought he had better stick to his original plan and go, which he is most anxious to do. I think it quite possible that he may remain in office, after all, and in any case his successor is likely to be of similar views as far as foreign trade is-concernecl and to be influenced by anything which he may tell him as the result of his visit to England. I could not now find any other delegate equaPy familiar with trade questions from the official point of view.He gladly accepts the invitation to Glasgow, but doubts his ability to stay for-Manchester.   M. Wasenius accepts for both places.GEORGIA.De jure Recognition.-On 11th February Colonel Stokes was authorized [No. 24] to inform the Georgian Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government granted them de jure recognition.Georgia and Armenia. The following wireless message was sent to the Georgian Government by M. Chicherin on 18th February : As early as November last the Georgian Government occupied with their troops not only the neutral zone between Georgia and Armenia, but also the northern part of&quot;
the territory7 which undoubtedly belonged to Armenia. Regardless of the protest of the Armenian Soviet Government of 26th November, the Georgian troops continued to occupy this locality, subjecting the population to great oppression. Not satisfied with this, the Georgian Government mined Armenian bridges, carried on propaganda among the population for union with Georgia, and even made the inhabitants sign written statements that they would express themselves in favour of the annexation of this territory by Georgia. On 11th February the inhabitants in the village of Ohagally, within the boundaries of Armenia,&apos; and several neighbouring villages revolted against the Georgian occupation. During the following few days the rising not only spread throughout the neutral zone, but apparently (?; affected the Moslem population of tbe Borchalinsk district. In accordance with the statement of the Georgian Government, Armenian and Azerbaijan regular forces are taking part in the lighting. We have been informed that the Georgian Government arrested the Armenian and Azerbaijan missions in Tiflis. Comrade Scheinman, Russian Plenipotentiaire-teutiary representative in Tiflis, expressed his readiness to accompany personally the representative of the Georgian Government to try and settle the conflict with the insurgents. The Georgian Government, however, refused this offer. Notwithstanding this, the Russian Government did not give up hope of achieving a peaceful solution of the problem by negotiations with all parties concerned. With this object in view, it offers its services both to the Georgian and Armenian Governments. Upon receipt of consent from the interested parties it is prepared to send its representative to Tiflis, vested with full powers to conduct negotiations with all contending parties in the name of the Russian Government. We desire to know whether the Georgian Government would agree to our sending as plenipotentiary representative Yenukidze, member of the presiding body of the AU-Russian executive committee.GERMANY.The Paris Decision.-Qn 19th February Lord D&apos;Abernon telegraphed [No. 63] the gist of a speech made, the day before, by tbe Minister for Foreign Affairs at Darmstadt: He stated that, if the London conference did not lead to any result, sanctions could not be immediately applied, for under the terms of the peace treaty the question must next be dealt with by the Reparation Commission. It was only if Germany found herself compelled to refuse the payment imposed upon her by the Reparation Commission that sanctions could be.applied in accordance with the peace treaty. The refusal of the German Government to accept the Paris decision was based on the support afforded by the satisfactorily7 united attitude of the German people. The situation now depended upon whether the German people effectively7 supported this refusal and maintained, their attitude in face of the perils which menaced them. In Hesse, as throughout his South German tour, he had had the satisfaction of observing the firmness and determination of the popular attitude. This fact would greatly support him in his journey to London.Prussian Landtag Elections. Telegraphing [No. 65] from Berlin on 21st February with regard to the Prussian Landtag elections which had taken place the clay7 before, Lord D&apos;Abernon reported on the results as follows :  Tbe general anticipation regarding the elections was a large move to the Right, This has not occurred. The considerable gains made by7 the German National party have been achieved almost entirely7 at the cost of the German Peoples&apos; party, who are nearly as conservative and military as the German Nationals, although less openly7 dynastic. While voters on the Right have moved towards their extreme wing, voters of the Left have rallied towards the Centre. The majority of tbe Socialists,, who are very moderate, have gained largely7 at the expense of more advanced Socialists. Abstentions on the extreme Left were more numerous. The poll was fairly large, about 70 per cent, of the electorate. The whole election appears to have . passed off with extreme quiet.Telegraphing [No. 67] again on the following day7 Lord D&apos;Abernon further reported that the provisional total results of the elections had been published ; German Nationals 73, German Peoples&apos; party  56, Centre S3, Guelphs 6, Democrats 25, Majority7 Socialists 111, Independent Socialists 28, Communists 30. 25-4 B
-JAPAN.The Political Situation. Sir Charles Eliot sent the following telegram [No. 69] from Tokio on 14th February : Last week the Government dealt successfully wirli the educational troubles and passed its budget by a majority of more than a hundred. A motion that Japan should initiate disarmament, and limit her naval construction in agreement wdth Great Britain was rejected by an overwhelming majority. Too much stress should not be laid on this as a sign of. warlike feeling, for the motion had not a fair chance, being introduced by an independent member who had been recently expelled from the Opposition. The naval attache reports that the naval staff are giving their serious attention to the limitation of armaments, and that measures to that end, if accompanied by satisfactory safeguards, would be welcomed by the officers generally.PERSIA.     *The Political Situation. On 16th February Mr. Norman sent [No. 107] the following appreciation of the situation by Nosret-ed-Dowleh, whose inclusion in the Cabinet Mr. Norman has previously advocated [F.C.R., xxxv, p. 5] : Nosret-ed-Dowleh does not think the situation, as yet, quito desrjerate. He notices a lack of organization and leadership amongst the politicians and the deputies favourable to us. I have also noticed it, but have been unable to do much to remedy it, because nobody but a Persian could accomplish this, and there has hitherto been none on whom I could depend. He thinks that two or three weeks of well-directed activity may suffice to cure this fault and unite these people on the question of an agreement with. Great Britain. He also observes amongst the public a feeling of lassitude produced by the prolongation of the present crisis, which, in his opinion, will soon dispose them to desire a strong Government capable of opening the Medjliss.While he does not believe that such a weak Government as is likely to come into power now, Avill be able to do this, he prefers that the situation so produced should be prolonged until he has had time to complete his work amongst the deputies. He would therefore welcome a stop-gap Cabinet. He said that before the beginning of operations he must of course know what changes His Majesty&apos;s Government would admit in the Anglo-Persian agreement, or on what basis they would be willing to negotiate a new one, since it was obvious for many reasons that the existing one could never pass in its present form.   The chief reasons were : (1) The weakening of British influence in consequence of the evacuation of Enzeli and Resht and the announcement of the approaching withdrawal from Easvin.(2) The apparent advantages to Persia of the Russo-Persian Treaty of which the terms are known.(3) The recent repudiation of the agreement by most of the deputies, hitherto favourable to it, clue to fear for their personal safety and to a desire to rebut the accusation of having been bribed by Great Britain to support it.Nosret-ed-Dowleh therefore thinks that to avoid injury to the prestige of His Majesty^s Government, which would result from the rejection of the agreement by the Medjliss, it would be wise to annul it, and make use of this very annulment to obtain more or less the same results in another form. He thinks that, if after coming into power he were in a position to announce to the public that, as a consequence of negotiations with His Majesty&apos;s Government and of changed circumstances, the-agreement had been denounced, he would at once gain prestige and strength sufficient to impose his programme on public opinion and on the Medjliss which he would open immediately afterwards. Thus, on the one hand, British prestige, and^ on the other hand British interests would be saved, for his programme could not but be favourable to the latter.If the entire direction of affairs is left to him he guarantees success, but he thinks that if denunciation of agreement becomes known prematurely, or if it is denounced-by a weak or hostile Government, the result so far from being advantageous to British interests will be fatal to them.I explained to him Your Lordship&apos;s attitude regarding- agreement in so far as 1 understand it, but he nevertheless begs me to ask you the above questions.
He also proposes to begin a campaign against the Russo-Persian Treaty, in which he sees many&apos; weak points.I ought to mention in this connexion that General Officer Commanding Norpoi-force insists that the Bolshevik Minister, who will be accompanied by a numerous staff of propagandists and doubtless well supplied with money for purposes of (group undecypherable), should not be allowed to reach Teheran until after departure of British troops so as to avoid the danger of a hostile movement in their rear.Apart from the entire and loyal support of this Legation, Nosret does not intend to ask for any help from His Majesty s Government until his work can show results sufficient to justify a request for them, but he appears, while in London, to have gained the impression that if something tangible is accomplished before April it may be possible to retain British troops for a few months longer, perhaps part at the expense of Persian Government, who would (? group omitted) necessary sum from (? British) source, of course on adequate security.I told him that I saw no reason to suppose that there was any longer a chance of this. While 1 shall give him what little help I still can, I think that he greatly underrates the difficulties in his way.On 17th February Mr. Norman announced [No. 113] that Sipahdar had succeeded in forming a Cabinet. With the exceptions that Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh took the vacant post of Minister of Foreign Affairs, and that Vahidul Mulk retired, the new Government consists of the same Ministers as the last.The Times of 21st February published the following list as received from their correspondent : The Sipahdar Azam  - - Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior.Mohtasheni-es-Sultaneh - Foreign Affairs.Nasr-ul-Mulk - Public Works.Amin-ul-Mulk           - - Education.Amir Nizam -         - - War.Salar Lashkar           - - Justice.Mirza Isa Khan        - . - Finance (acting).Mushar-ul-Mulk        - - Without portfolio.Revolutionary Movement in Teheran. Telegraphing [No. 121] on 21st February, Mr. Norman sent the following report : The Kasvin and Hamadan detachments of the Cossack Brigade, numbering from 2,500 . to 3,000 men, with 8 field, guns and 18 machine guns under command of Colonel Riza Khan, marched from Kasvin on Teheran, and entered the town 21st February, shortly after midnight.While they were still encamped without the town representatives of the Shah and the Cabinet, accompanied by two members of my staff, went out to ascertain their intentions and to dissuade them from entering the town. In the latter attempt they Avere- unsuccessful.Riza Khan said that Cossacks Avho had had experience of Bolsheviks, and knew Avhat they Avere, AAere tired of seeing one inefficient Government succeed another at Teheran, where apparently&apos; nobody Avas making any preparations to oppose the Bolshevik advance which avouici folloAA7 the AvithdraAval of British troops. They were therefore coming to Teheran to establish a strong Government Avhich avouici see to this matter. They professed loyalty- and devotion to the Shah, but were determined to set aside the evil counsellors by&apos; whom he had been surrounded. They also-professed goodwill to us, and said that no foreigners had anything to fear.There Avas no force with which to oppose their entry7 into the town and they encountered practically no resistance, but OAving to an accident or a misunderstanding shots Avere fired from a police post and Cossacks returned the fire killing seAen men. they are now established in the town and have taken charge of all Government establishments. The Government has ceased to exist and Sipahdar took refuge at the Legation early this morning but was induced to leave, and I have obtained the assurance that he will not be molested.The revolutionaries wiR probably choose Seyyid Zia Ud Din as Prime Minister. They say that in spite of the emptiness of the Treasury they can form an efficient force without foreign j)ecuniary aid, as there is plenty of money in the country and they know Avhere to look for it. In pursuance of this policy7 they7 have arrested some of the rich men of the town, including, I regret to say7, Farman Farma and his son 25-4 C
Prince Firuz, on whose behalf I am exerting my good offices. Other arrests made, which are those of intriguers mostly anti-British, are cause rather for satisfaction than regret.I saw the Shah this morning and advised him to enter into relations with the leaders of the movement and to acquiesce in their demands which is his only possible course. I was able to reassure him regarding his personal safety, and though frightened he did not talk of flight.Soviet Government&apos;? Proposals. Mr. Norman reported [No. 92] from Teheran on 10th February that he had received from Sipahdar a copy of a telegram from Mushavir-ul-Mamalek, in which the latter announced the receipt of an official note from the Russian Soviet Government. In this note it was stated that Russia and Azerbaijan were ready to evacuate Persia as soon as possible, but it was complained that, as between two parties, the withdrawal of troops depended on that of troops of the other party (presumably Great Britain). In the meantime it was proposed to form a commission to arrange the matter at once, and the Soviet Government asked the consent of the Persian Government to this proposal in order that they might send their representative forthwith.Mr. Norman considered that this request was an indication that the Soviet Government intended to observe their engagements towards the Persian Government, and he trusted that His Majesty&apos;s Government would comply with the request to appoint a representative, on the proposed commission. This request might be expected to issue either direct from the Soviet Government or through the Persian Government as soon as one was formed.On the other hand, reports of the presence in Gilan of 7,000 Russian troops [F.G.R., xxxiv, p. 5] with guns and transport suggested the determination to advance as soon as our opposition should be removed.In the telegram referred to above it.wras stated that the departure of the Soviet mission, consisting of 40 pjersons, had been postponed, but that it would eventually travel by Enzeli, passing through Kasvin, and a request had been made for a safe conduct through the latter place should it still be occupied by British troops. All the amendments to the Persian-Soviet agreement proposed by the Persian Government had been accepted by the Soviet Government. Following the signature of this agreement, it was proposed to conclude treaties with Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.On 12th February Mr. Norman reported [No. 101] a further telegram from the same source as that given above, elated 7th February, in which it was stated that a Bolshevik Mission consisting of 50 persons had left Moscow for Persia. This telegram again supported the Soviet Governments proposal for a joint Anglo-Russian commission to arrange for the simultaneous withdrawal of British and Bolshevik troops.Referring to the above, Mr. Norman telegraphed [No. 114] on 18th February that the Prime Minister considered the proposed joint commission to be a matter of great importance and was anxious that it should be early assembled, with which object he begged for the nomination of a British representative as soon as possible. It was intended that the Persian Government should be in charge of all arrangements, and would themselves be represented on the commission. Mr. Norman recommended acceptance of the proposal.In a later telegram [No. 118], dated 20th February, Mr. Norman reported that the Prime Minister had informed him of the receipt, through the Persian Minister in London, of a telegram from Mushavir-ul-Mamalak which embodied an official proposal from the Soviet Government for the immediate assembly of a mixed military commission either at Kasvin or Teheran.Mr. Norman called attention to the fact that the Soviet Government made the proposal on behalf of that of Azerbaijan, and that according to it the former would not be represented on the commission, which would consist of representatives of Great Britain, Azerbaijan and Persia, with a Persian as president.In reply to the foregoing, a telegram [No. 88]. was despatched from the Foreign Office to Mr. Norman on 22nd February, saying that it was out of the question that a British representative should take part in such a commission as was proposed, on which the Soviet Government would not be represented, doubtless on the irLea that it
-was not they who had invaded Persia. His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided on the withdrawal of British troops from North Persia as a question per se, and the Persian Government had long ago been informed of the decision. It could not be treated as forming part of an arrangement calling for reciprocal action from other parties.SWEDEN.The Government.-Telegraphing [No. 39] from Stockholm on 18th February, Mr. Barclay reported that the leaders of all parties had declined to form a Cabinet. The King, he said, had been in consultation with Herr von Sydow, Governor of Gottenburg and Swedish representative on the Schleswig Commission, and had, * he understood, requested him to endeavour to form a ministry. In that event, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs would continue in office.TURKEY.Financial Crisis. On 11th February Sir Horace Rumbold telegraphed [No. 102] regarding the state of insolvency in which the Turkish Government once more found itself. The real crisis, he said, would arise at the beginning of next month when the deficit in respect of salaries and other urgent services would be  T. 6,000,000, or thereabouts, whilst the receipts from customs during February would barely reach one twentieth of that sum.Large amounts were, however, due in respect of arrears of taxation. In the case of property tax alone the arrears were upwards of  T. 2,000,000, mainly due to the refusal to pay by allied subjects, who had now been warned that if they refused to pay taxes legally due they would be liable to the penalties provided by law, and would receive no help from their diplomatic and consular representatives.The provisional financial commission had suggested that the customs revenue -could be increased either by reverting to the 11 per cent, ad valorem duty, or by-increasing specific duties in proportion. Either course, however, would be but a temporary palliative, affording but a passing relief, and moreover would not take effect for several weeks. It might be necessary, therefore, even before the definite financial -commission was constituted, for the allies to find funds to enable the Turkish Government to carry on.
