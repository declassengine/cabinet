FOREIGN  COUNTRIES   REPORT.AFGHANISTAN.    -Internal Affairs [F.C.R., xxix, p. 2]. On 4th. November the Viceroy reported JNo. 218] that in view of the Afghan fear of a Bolshevik invasion, and their steps to strengthen the northern frontier,- there was a continuance of recruiting activity throughout Afghanistan and of the collection of transport at Kabul. A telephone line had been established between Kabul and Kandahar.Herat. -The Assistant Foreign Minister, Abdul Hadi, was reported to have arrived at Herat on 19th October with his mission from Kabul.Telegraphing [No. 219] on 10th November, the Viceroy said that the distribution of quantities of revolutionary literature among the Afghans by the Bolshevik Council in Herat had been reported. A party of Turks, apparently men of some importance,, accompanied by six Russians, had. arrived in Herat on their way to Kabul.ARABIA.King Hussein and the Iklncan [F.C.R., xxix, p. 2]. On 4th November Mr. Scott reported [No. 1051] the receipt of. a telegram from. King Hussein asking that lbn Saud should take over the Hejaz. The reason given for this request was that Taif was being threatened by the Ikbwan, which must result in bloodshed, in which he did not wish to be implicated.Emir Abdulla [F.C.R., xxix,.p. 2].-Lord Allenby telegraphed on 13th November [No. 1088] that it had been officially announced at Mecca that the Emir Abdulla was visiting Ma&apos;an for purposes of inspection.   The visit had been reported from Jeddah.-    .:- ARGENTINA.Mr. Harding&apos;s Attitude in regard to the League of Nations. Mr. Macleay telegraphed from Buenos Ayres as follows on 10th November [No. 201] :- Considerable interest appears, to have been aroused in America hy a leading article of the Argentine newspaper La Naeion of 7th November, which, while discussing his probable attitude towards the international question, suggested that if Mr. Harding were definitely to abandon the League of Nations, Latin American countries would be placed in the dilemma of having to choose whether they would separate themselves from the League of Nations or abandon the Monroe doctrine ; and expressed the opinion that in such a contingency they would probably choose the latter alternative. - -In a recent interview with a correspondent of La Naeion, Mr. Harding is reported to have said that the Monroe doctrine was not a pact or an international treaty, but a declaration of policy whereby the United States had pledged themselves to protect the Latin American countries from abuse or attack by European Powers. The La Nacion observes that this is precisely the interpretation of the Monroe doctrine which evokes the greatest opposition in the majority of (group undecypher-able) in all Latin American peoples, and that it is contrary to President Wilson&apos;s interpretation, according- to which the doctrine establishes perfect equality among all the nations of America; an equality which, the newspa]Der remarks, cannot exist when there is any question of unsolicited protection which is merely the outcome of a unilateral resolution on the part of the Power which claims to exercise it against dangers in which no one believes.The article is symptomatic of the unpopularity of the United States policy7 and business methods in this country, which is suffering from the marked rise of the dollar exchange. The idea appears to be prevalent that the rise has been artificially engineered by American banks to force the Argentine Republic to release her gold reserves, and Argentine importers have refused to accept an immense quantity of American goods on the plea of late delivery. . ...
ARMENIA.Armistice with Turkey. On 9th November Colonel Stokes reported [No. 487] tbat: the Armenian Government, in an official communique published on 7th November, had announced the signature of an armistice with the Turks under the following conditions : .(1) The Armenian troops to withdraw from the west bank of the Arpachai.(2) During the continuance of the peace negotiations, the Turks to occupy the fortress and railway station of Alexandropol and the environs to a radius of 10 kilometres.(3) The Turks to guarantee the maintenance of order and the individual safety of-the inhabitants of Alexandropol.Proposed Military Alliance with Georgia. On 7th November Colonel Stokes asked [No. 455] to be informed as to the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to a military alliance between Armenia and Georgia. Such an alliance had been suggested by the Armenian delegation, who, however, refused to put their proposals into writing ; Colonel Stokes thought the request. reasonable. He added that he understood the reason for delay was that the Georgians had hopes, under an agreement now being negotiated, of. getting oil from Azerbaijan, but were uncertain as to whether the Allies would support them. Hesitation to commit herself, without such an assurance, appeared to him to be reasonable. The Armenians appeared to be convinced that a militaiy alliance would not be signed by Georgia, as she had been assured from Moscow that the Turks would not enter her territory.BULGARIA.Frontier Question. On 6th November Lord Derby transmitted [No. 1301] the text of a telegram which had been sent to Sofia that day: The Jugo-Slav Legation have notified the Conference of Ambassadors of their intention to occupy the territories assigned to Jugo-Slavia by the Treaty of Neuilly, and the Bulgarian delegate having protested to the Conference of Ambassadors against this proposed action, the Conference of Ambassadors decided to-day that the Allied representatives at Belgrade and Sofia should make joint representations to the two Governments concerned, to the effect that this occupation cannot take place without the consent of the Boundary Commission. The text of the communication to be made is as-follows : The Conference of Ambassadors, charged with the duty of executing the Treaty of Neuilly, laid down on thee30th October that the Delimitation Corn-mission appointed under the treaty can authorize the occupation by the interested Pow-ers of the territories which are attributed to them as and when the Commission completes the work of delimination. In the meanwhile, the Conference of Ambassadors wishes to make it clear that no occupation can take place without the written authorization of the Delimitation Commission, to whom it appertains to decide if the conditions required to justify this occupation have in fact been fulfilled.I request that you will co-operate with your Allied colleagues in making this joint representation as desired by the Conference. .On 5th November Sir Arthur Peel reported from Sofia [No. 157] that the Acting-Minister for Foreign Affairs had that day given him an assurance that, with a view to preventing any frontier incident, orders had been given to the officer commanding the frontier troops (? not omitted) to come into contact with the Serbian officer commanding, and that the Bulgarian troops had been withdrawn from the frontier. At his request the Acting-Minister for Foreign Affairs promised to convej&apos;-&quot;this assurance in writing to the representatives of the Great Powers.He wished him, Sir A. Peel, particularly to inform his Government that he hoped this proof of the loyal conduct of Bulgaria, in this matter as in the evacuation of Thrace, would produce a favourable impression on the Powers.On the following day he telegraphed [No. 159] that he had heard thakthe Serb-Croat-Slovene troops had occupied the frontier territory at 8.20 that morning up to -the line on the treatj7 map.   The Bulgarian troops had been withdrawn. . .-.-T
In the case of the Tsaribrod area the Bulgarians had withdrawn up to the lines which had been recommended by the Frontier Commission, i.e., to within a short distance, from the map line. The Serb-Croat-Slovene authorities insisted on a complete withdrawal to the map line, notwithstanding that a&apos;decision on this matter was still pending. Colonel Giles thought that a similar procedure was (? probable) in the Klissura area and elsewhere where the decision had been referred to the Conference of Ambassadors, though reports had not yet been received.No incident had been reported.The decision of the Conference of Ambassadors, that the occupation should proceed (? as) the delimitation was completed, was received last night by the French Legation and communicated to the Serb-Croat-Slovene delegate on the Commission,, who stated that it was too late (? to do anything), though he manifestly could have personally entered into communication&quot; with the Serbian authorities at Tsaribrod. had he desired to do so.THE CAUCASUS.Georgia and the Bolsheviks. On 12th November the Foreign Office inquired. [No. 351] of Colonel Stokes as to whether he had any confirmation of a report from -Constantinople to the effect that the Bolsheviks had issued an ultimatum to Georgia calling on her to cease negotiations with France for the export of oil and to cease trading with that country and England in Batum ; also to leave the communists unmolested, and to have no further dealings with General Wrangel-.On 12th November Colonel Stokes reported [No. 489] that a Russian officer, who-left Erzerum on 12th October, had informed the French Military Mission at Tiflis that on that date there were at Erzerum. One British colonel and six British soldiers,, prisoners in the bands of the Kemalists, but he could give no names.CHINA.Urga attacked by an Armed Force. Mr. Clive telegraphed as follows [No. 474J from Peking on 10th November : - hi the last week of October Urga [Mongolia] was suddenly&apos;- attacked by an organized force reported to number (? 2,000) men supported by seven machine guns ancb six field guns. There is no certain information as to the identification of this band,, but it is generally- believed to consist of Russians or Buriats detached from General Seminoff s forces, with perhaps some Mongolian malcontents.No definite information has been received since 30th October. From reports received up to that date, the Chinese appear to have succeeded in holding Urga. The-telegraph line south of Urga has been cut, and wireless is out of action either through the absence of the staff or because destroyed. The (? British) Marconi engineei-Dockray in charge of the station had left Urga before the troubles commenced, but is-now (? endeavouring) to return there with Chinese from Kalgan. The Chinese have commandeered all motor cars and horses in Urga. There are some Americans in the-town, who have reported that Chinese soldiers are looting and searching all Russian, houses and terrifying the Russian population, which is in fear of massacre.The only British subject known to be in Urga is a Mr. Miles.The Americans have, with the help of their Legation, organized an armed rescue party to attempt to reach Urga in motor cars. This party is now (? at) Kalgan, but it is doubtful whether they will be able to proceed as the Chinese have raised difficulties about passports.The Chinese are said to be sending reinforcements from the Kalgan area and from Manchuria. They wished to send some Vickers aeroplanes from Mukden, but I. have refused to agree.Soviet Russia and &apos;China. The following is the translation of a message by &quot;wireless from Moscow as intercepted, dated 14th November :-M. Chicherin, People&apos;s Commissary for Foreign Affairs, has despatched a note to-the Chinese Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the effect that, after the defeat suffered by Seminoffs robber bands, some of the defeated and scattered White Guard detach-ments, directing their way to Manchuria, there joined local elements hostile to the-
Chinese Republic.. The Chinese troops operating in the south are not sufficiently strong to.destroy the White Guard bands, and have therefore requested our military command to assist them in the struggle against these hands. The Soviet. Goyern-ment consider that the speedy destruction of these hands is in the interests of both countries, and is prepared to co-operate with the Chinese troops. The Soviet Govern-ment affirm that the Soviet troops advancing into Mongolia are acting as the friends of China, and, after achieving their object, will immediately leave Chinese territory.DANTZIG.Signature of the Act by the Dantzig Delegation.  On 9th November Lord Derby telegraphed [No. 1315] as follows : The Act establishing the free city of Dantzig, which has already been signed by the four principal Allied Powers, was signed this afternoon by the Dantzig delegation. It will come into force on 15th November. The Dantzig delegation have also signed the Polish-Dantzig treaty and the protocol attached thereto,.   The Poles have not yet signed. - : &quot;On 1th November Sir Horace Rumbold reported from Warsaw [No. 1002] that lie had been informed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had been authorized to instruct&apos; M. Paderewski to sign the convention with Dantzig on certain conditions: &quot;These were three : one that effective control of the waterways should be given to Poland, a second that she should have a mandate to protect the frontiers of the Dantzig territory, the third that she should be given certain property which formerly belonged to the German Government in Dantzig.GERMANY. . &apos;  &apos;Attitude of Bavaria. The following is the translation of a wireless message as intercepted, dated Nauen, 15th November : Bavarian and Prussian journals point out the special impressiveness of the speech of the Democratic leader Dirr in the Munich Diet on the Bavarian attitude towards the Reich. Dirr said that a Bavarian was-as undesirable as a-Prussian hegemony, for anew main line (viz., splitting up of North1 and South Germany) would lead, not only to the ruin of the Reich, but also to that of Bavaria. The Palatinate, Franconia and Swabia wo;.ld never want to belong to a Bavaria separated from the Empire. It was, in the first place, incumbent On-the Bavarian Government, in view of their increased responsibility for Bavaria&apos;s futureV&apos; not to take any action in foreign affairs without keeping in closest touch with the Government of the Reich.GREECE.Defeat of M. Venizelos. On 15th November Lord Granville telegraphed [No. 281] as follows :-M. Venizelos is hopelessly beaten. &apos;He has handed his resignation to the Regent, who is summoning M. Rhallys; to-morrow morning. M. Venizelos expects M. Rhallys to form a Government in time&apos; for him to hand over on Wednesday. M. Venizelos expresses confidence that he can maintain order so long, as he is President of the Council.Gossip declares that the Venizelists will loyally accept the verdict and that there is no danger of the intervention of either the army or navy. On the other hanck some people think that a Venizelist military coup will be attempted.Proposed Increase of Note Issue. On 4th November Mr. Russell was instructed [No. 200] as follows :- .The Greek Minister is being informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government feel considerable difficulty in assenting once again to an increase in Greek paper currency on a purely inflationist basis. , -The resolutions of the recent International Conference at Brussels, in which the Greek representatives concurred, emphasize the importance of reducing inflation: 111 view of this and the discount at which the drachma stands in relation not only to the dollar but also to sterling, it is most desirable that before proceeding further with 22-3 B .   -N      &apos;     G-
Gtbe proposed measure tbe Greek Government should endeavour to find other means of providing the relatively small sum in question, e.g., by taxation or by the reduction, of the existing expenditure.   ;We. are inviting tbe French and Italian Governments to co-operate dn urging these views at Athens.. In reply to this Lord Granville telegraphed as follows [No. 275] on&apos; 12th November :  The Minister of Finance, who is also acting as Minister for Foreign Affairs, sent M. Lekatsas to explain to me the position of the Greek Government and to urge His Maj esty&apos;s Government to withdraw their opposition to a new issue of notes for 100,00(0,000 drach. He banded to me the memorandum which had been sent and approved by M. Venizelos. While fully concurring in principles (word undecypher-able): at Brussels, the Greek Government declare their financial policy and position compare favourably with those of most other countries ; they inform me confix (Iwtiallii that they have prepared a Bill for submission to the new Chamber for large increases in taxation, and they point out that the 300,000,000 issued in July are until now their, only uncovered, issue. The 400,000,000 now asked for are indispensable for the maintenance of their troops in Asia Minor.The French delegate on the Inter-Allied Financial Commission, who is an expert, confirms the general accuracy of the statements in the memorandum and especially of the last sentence., We agree that assent should be given in the circumstances (? to the) issue (? hut that the) opportunity should be taken to warn the Greek Government seriously with regard to the future. Though the matter is urgent it would behest that the three Governments should be in concert and reply to the Greek Government in similar terms. My French colleague and my Italian colleague are telegraphing in same sense.HUNGARY.Resignation of the Cabinet. On 16ih November Mr. Athelstan Johnson sent the following report. [No. 561] : -The) Prime Minister and the Cabinet tendered their resignation to the Governor yesterday. His Highness refused to accept their resignation on the ground that until order had been fully established a ministerial crisis would cause developmehts that might be dangerous to the State.The. Prune Minister has informed the National Assembly of his decision to retain office for the time being, and will adjourn, the Chamber on the 17th November for a week. -----ITALY.Agreement with Serbia. On 11th November Sir George Buchanan telegraphed [No. 491] that the Press had announced that a preliminary agreement had been reached between the Italian and Jugo-Slav delegates at Santa Margherita on the following lines : The whole of the eastern frontier of Venezia Giulia, as demanded by Italy, that is to say the frontier based on the mountain ridge Alonte Nevoso, according to the line: proposed by the Italian delegation, will be recognized ; this line shows only two slight rectifications in favour of the Jngo-Siavs, one to the north and one to the south of Monte Nevoso. To the north a part of the hollow of Longatico Loitsch is granted to Jugo-Slavia, but all the region of Idria remains in possession of the Italians. To the south of Monte Nevoso the Italian delegates had asked for the whole of the region of Oastua ; of this region a portion is now given to Jugo-Slavia and a less inhabited portion has been incorporated in the independent state of Fiume; Volosca and Aliba^ia remain to Italy,, and. also the entire possession of the railway Fiume-San Pietro, and territorial contiguity with Fiume is assured. Fiume is recognized by. Italy and Jugoslavia as a free,independent State without any control; its boundaries ame to.- be exactly those of. the corpus separatum The mixed Commission of Italians,and. Jugp-Slavs will define the technical problems relative to the trade of the1 city.   As regards the commercial requirements of Jugo-Slavia, Italy and Jugo-
Slavia will make no opposition if, for reasons of economical convenience, Sussak and its port wish, to be united in a &quot; consorzid &quot; with Fiume. The island of Cherso remains under Italian sovereignty in Dalmatia. Zara with its territory is to be annexed to Italy, who will thus-haye complete sovereignty there. There only remains to-be decided the boundaries of- the territory, which will probably be those of the administrative limits. The island of Ugliano&quot; will be considered as an integral part of Zara. The islands of Lussin,&quot; I.hue, and Asinello, and the small islands depending on them, pass under Italian sovereignty, and in Dalmatia the island of Lagosta. The Dalmatians who are left outside the boundaries of Italy will be given Italian citizen-ship whenever they demand it;. they will, however, be recognized by Jugo-Slavia to possess all the rights granted to d Ugo-Slavia citizens.&apos; To maintain the close intel-lectual and cultural intercourse between Italy and Jugo-Slavia the full validity of titles and diplomas granted in one country will be recognized by the other ; further, the Italian Government contemplate the grant to Jugo-Slav citizens of 20 scholarships in the University of Padua, wdth the reserve that recipients should be chosen amongst the students of Dalmatian cities which have passed to Jngo-Slavia; apart from the, political agreement, an economic agreement will be prepared between the two countries,, and with this object negotiations will be opened as soon as possible. On receipt of this news Signor Giolitti and General Badoglio left Rome last night for Santa Margherita,Telegraphing again on 13th November [No. 494] Sir George said that it was reported in the Press that the agreement of Rappalo had been signed that day. The outstanding points had been settled as follows : Italy was to have sovereignty over the whole commune of Zara within a radius (? eight) miles of the town ; whilst the islands of the Zara channel were assigned to Jugo-Slavia. Italy was to have Lagosta and the smaller islands.It was further announced officially (? that) the United States Government had stated they would approve any direct agreement reached by the two Governments.On 16th November Lord Curzon despatched the following message to our representatives at Rome and Belgrade, for conveyance to the respective Governments : -His Majesty&apos;s Government are glad to learn that the delegates of the Italian and Serb-Croat-Slovene Governments have, as the result of the separate negotiations which they have recently conducted at Rapallo arrived at an agreement which they declare to be acceptable to both countries.While His Majesty&apos;s Government have not yet been put in possession of the text of the agreement, they welcome the opportunity of declaring their satisfaction at the prospect of cordial relations between two friendly and Allied States, and their hope that on the basis of a settlement which both parties have chosen for themselves the foundations of a lasting and undisturbed, peace may be laid.D&apos;Annunzio. On 14th November Sir George Buchanan reported [No. 497] that the Minister of Marine had admitted in the Chamber that D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s troops had occupied the islands of Veglia and Arbe, but that the other reports, of designs on Albania, were (? thus far) fanciful.The Press reports were conflicting, but it was announced that D&apos;Annunzio had occupied Castua and Sussak.The King, whom he had seen this morning, in answer to a question had stated that he knew no more than he did of what D&apos;Annunzio was doing.MEXICO. .Recognition of Senor Obregon.- Lord Curzon informed Mr. Cummins on 9th November [No. l07] that it wras proposed, to recognize Senor Obregon after his installation as President.Colliers&apos;. Strike. Ou 5th November Mr. Cummins reported [No. 231] that the colliers in Mexico had been on strike for some weeks.The owners having refused to cede, the Government had assumed charge of the mines and the men had returned to work with increased wages.. One mine was a British enterprise, and the President had expressed the hope that he (Mr. Cummins) would not misinterpret this action which he had taken reluctantly to avoid paralyzation of the railways, smelters, &amp;c.22-3 C
----- &quot; - ;sPERSIA. -&apos; G -\ -New Cabinet. On Pith November.:Mr. Normanrreported [No. 745] that Sipahdar Azam bad presented t!ie following Cabinet to the Shah : Sipahdar Azam, President of Council and Minister of the Interior. Aminal Mulk, Minister of Finance,. -Mirza Sulaiman Khan, Minister of Justice. Amir Nizam, Minister of War.Salar Lashkar, ^Minister of Public Works, Trade and Agriculture.Sardar Motamed, Minister of Posts and Telegraphs.Vahid ul Mulk, Minister of Education.Fahim ud Dowleh, Acting-Minister of Foreign Affairs.Adib es Saltane, Assistant to the President of the Council.Adib id Mulk, Vice-Minister of the Interior.POLAND. . ^   -Poland and Lithuania. On 12th November Sir Percy Loraine reported [No. 1014T that the President of the League of Nations Commission had kindly communicated to-him the text of the note which he had communicated to the Lithuanian and Polish Governments on 10th November.   The following was a translation : The Commission of Control of. the League of Nations, taking its stand on the resolution of the Council of the League of 27th October, according to which the dele-gates of the two Governments gave to the Council on behalf of their respective Governments the formal assurance that these would abstain from all acts of mutual hostility and would do all in their power to maintain peace; and taking also into consideration the desire expressed alike by the Lithuanian representative attached to the Commission and by the Polish Government to cause the earliest possible cessation of bloodshed, has the honour to request the Lithuanian Government: (1) To enjoin on its troops a strictly defensive attitude on the whole front on which Lithuanian troops are in contact with those of General Zeligowski. - (2) The. immediate suspension of the despatch of any aircraft eastwards of the territory occupied by its troops, whether for distribution of proclamations, to make reconnaissances, to undertake bombardments, or for anv other purpose.The Commission likewise has the honour to request the Polish Government to undertake intervention, so far as its means permit, with General Zeligowski:  (1) So that the latter&apos;s troops may be ordered to maintain a strictly defensive- attitude on all fronts where they are in contact with Lithuanian troops. (2) For the immediate suspension of the despatch of aircraft west of the territory occupied by his troops for proclamations, reconnaissances, bombardments or any other purpose. The Commission will leave immediately for the front in order to itself take stock of the situation on the spot and of the future measures to be taken.General Zeligowski. On 9th November Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 480] to Sir Percy Loraine as follows : General Zeligowski&apos;s proceedings as reported to us are rapidly becoming intolerable, and not only are the)&apos; grossly unjustified and inhuman, but, if they continue, will end by letting loose forces of disorder which may easily lead to a critical situation in eastern Europe. It is impossible to believe that the Polish Government, or at any rate Mai-skal Pilsudski, are entirely powerless to deal with their reckless compatriot, all the more as they appear to have come to some unofficial understanding with him whereby food, clothing, and other necessities are being supplied to him in return for the right to run trains through Vilna. There is the further suspicion, which has not been dispelled, that the aeroplanes were supplied to General Zeligowski with the connivance of the Polish Government, as there were apparently none at Vilna at the time of its seizure and as General Zeligowski brought none with him.You should at once see the Minister for Foreign Affairs and inform him that His majesty&apos;s government take a most grave view of the situation and impress on him.
that the prestige of Poland is being fatally damaged abroad by Genez-al ZeligowskFs -actions. You should further point out that if it transpires that assistance is still being given directly or indirectly to him by Polish authorities, either military or civil, the Polish Government will have to bear the full&apos;responsibility for the consequences, which may be very serious.On 11th November Sir Percy Loraine reported [No. 1010] that he had handed the-Minister for Foreign Affairs a memorandum in the sense of the above instructions..&apos; After some lively conversation Prince Sapieha had stated the situation thus : If the-Lithuanians, who were now attacking, should beat General Zeligowski, he would -altogether lose control; and if Vilna were taken, perhaps even before that, nothing-would prevent the Polish army from rushing to General Zeligowski s rescue.   The general would accept an armistice the instant it was offered; he had already asked for one four times in vain.   He had also applied in vain to Warsaw for help:   The League of Nations had been begged to intervene, and its representative in Warsaw had been implored to go to the spot without delay ; but for some reason or another that had been found impossible.    Unless something should be done very soon to stop-Lithuania, the situation would slip out of his, Prince Sapieha&apos;s, control.   He had; already sent a message to General Zeligowski urging moderation.; RUSSIA.   .Soviet Submarines [F.G.R., xxix, p. 10]. The following message was received -&apos; from M. Chicherin on 14th November : -Answering your message of 3rd November, which contained a reply to the.note . of the bead of our trade delegation, M. Krassin, dated 19th October, you pass completely under silence the fact that M. Krassin categorically declared that the Russian Government does not consider itself as being at war with Great Britain at the present time, but you refer instead to some unknown declaration of a Soviet Minister whom yon refrain even from naming. This person is presumed to have declared that he hoped that our submarines in the Black Sea would sink an Entente vessel. In view of the absence of any precise indications of the person, place, and time referred to, we are unable to verify how far the information on which your -allegation is based is correct. Seeing that the British Government did not ask us for any explanation concerning this alleged speech of a Soviet Minister, we cannot refrain from expressing our astonishment that the British Government puts forth this allegation as a ground for naval action against Russian submarines. -The second ground put forth in your message is the alleged reference in M. Krassin&apos;s note to the possibility for a Soviet submarine commander who would desire to torpedo a British ship on the excuse of mistaken identity. As a matter of : fact, M. Krassin&apos;s note spoke of the possibility for a.warship of not recognizing the nationality of a submarine, but did not contain the least reference to the possibility of a mistaken identity of a British warship. The principal argument by which your message seeks to justify hostile action against our submarines is the declaration that ; they are engaged in acts of open hostility against British interests in the Black Sea. The Russian Government is at a loss to understand what British interests are referred to, seeing that no British possessions or protectorates are situated on the shores of the Black Sea, and at any rate the British Government never notified us that any of these regions had ever become a British possession. In reality the only forces against which the Soviet army and navy are engaged on the Black Sea are the forces of General Wrangel, whom the British Government declared not to support any more-after bis offensive against Soviet Russia.In view of your message of 3rd November the Russian Government is compelled1 to ask the British Government whether General Wrangebs interests are to be-henceforth considered as being British interests. In case of a negative answer, the-&apos; Russian Government must consider your declaration concerning our submarines as-being based upon a misunderstanding, and confidently expects that the British Government will cancel the order referred to in your message.Refugees from South Russia. On 11th November Admiral de Robeck reported [No. 1195 J that British, French, and American subjects, as well as Russian children, from the British hospital were being evacuated from the Crimea, as General Wrangel had but little hope of holding his last line of defence.
Two days later he further reported [No. 1205] that M. Krivoschein had begged him to make one last appeal to His Majesty&apos;s Government to save from 12,000 to 15,000 civilians, men, women, and children, from the horrors which would follow the -entry of the Bolshevik troops. He urged strongly that ordinary humanity demanded that succour should not be refused.Admiral de Robeck said that it was practically impossible to allow any more refugees to land in Constantinople. It might be just possible to render the camp at Lemnos habitable, but it was unsuitable for the winter.On 13th November Lord Curzon informed Admiral de Robeck [No. 1085] that no further responsibility in regard to refugees who were not of British nationality could be assumed by His Majestv&apos;s Government, nor could they assist them to escape. He was instructing the British Ambassador in Paris that refugees should not land in &quot;Constantinople, and that the French Government must take the sole responsibility, as it had recognized the South Russian Government. Admiral cle Robeck should let it be generally known that His Majesty&apos;s Government had offered to mediate between General Wrangel and the Soviet Government in order to bring about an arrangement, which would make it unnecessary for any further flying from South Russia, and that General Wrangel bad rejected their offer.On 15th November Admiral de Robeck yet further reported [No. 1208] that the French High Commissioner had begged him to make over our Lemnos installation for the reception of refugees, many thousands of whom were arriving in French and.
