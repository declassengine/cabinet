FOREIGN  COUNTRIES   REPORT.ARABIA.King Hussein and the Peace Conference. On 7 th April Lord Allenby reported [No. 535] the receipt of a telegram from the King of Hejaz, in which the latter stated that his relations were solely with Great Britain ; with the Peace Conference he had none. Great Britain, he said, when inducing him to revolt, had accepted the independence of the Arab country, and trusting in her honour and relying on her reputation for keeping her word, he had risked all; he was not conscious of Great Britain regarding him as guilty of any crime.Lord Allenby proposed to reply saying that the British Government had every intention of upholding the promises it had made during the early negotiations, but was unable to accept King Hussein&apos;s statement that all his conditions had been accepted^ and that the declaration of the Damascus Congress was in accordance with the promises made him.Emir Abdtdla. In the same telegram King Hussein asked for a reply as to Emir Abdulla&apos;s visit to Cairo, and Lord Allenby proposed to say that he should like him to come at once. He added that lie regarded this visit as essential to the avoidance of serious trouble with the King.AUSTRIA.Central European Relief and Reconstruction. On 14th April Lord Curzon telegraphed to the British Ambassadors at Paris [No. 455], Rome [No. 144], Brussels [No. .68], and Tokyo [No. 119], as follows :-In connexion with thetauthorization recently given by the United States Congress for the suiDply of American flour, valued at 53 million dollars, on credit to European and contiguous countries, His Majesty&apos;s Government have undertaken to provide British credits up to 50 per cent, of the credits provided by the United States of America within a limit of 10,000,000Z., the intention being in the first instance to supply freight for American cereals. The British credit is intended primarily for Austria, but might be used for. Poland and Hungary, and possibly for other countries, in so far as a surplus may remain after providing for Austria.The   Governments   o&apos;f  Holland,   Denmark, Norway and Sweden  have been * approached by His Majesty&apos;s Government and have agreed in jmnciple to participate. The Swiss Government had previously agreed to do so.As at present arranged, it is proposed to hold a meeting at Paris on the 21st instant, at which it is hoped that the above-mentioned Governments will declare the exact extent of their participation. The main object of the meeting is to discuss methods of administration. The general plan, to which the above-mentioned Governments seem ready to adhere, is to set up an executive body at Paris, on which neutral Governments would be represented, to arrange for distribution between the receiving countries of .the various commodities and services offered on credit, and to be responsible for the practical work of consigning, delivering and accounting.Please ask the Government to which you are accredited whether they propose to take part in the scheme ; and, if so, to what extent. They should be informed of the proposed meeting on the 21st instant, at which Sir J. Bradbury, British Delegate on the Reparation Commission, and Sir W. Goode, chief British Delegate on the Austrian Section of the Reparation Commission, will act as British representatives, and they should be asked to nominate a representative to attend in the event of their deciding to participate.You should explain (1) that in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government it is essential that raw materials should be supplied on credit, in addition to the supply of food, in order that the countries may become self-supporting at the earliest possible moment; and (2) that the function of the conference will be limited to dealing with supplies in kind provided out of the Government credits and arranging for their transportation. There is no intention of trenching on the general questions of international credit of the kind which will be discussed at the forthcoming financial conference under the auspices of the League of Nations.
BALTIC STATES.Lithuania and the Soviet Government [F.C.R., xiv., p. 2].- On 6th April Mr. WarcL. telegraphing [No. 49] from Kovno, reported that the Lithuanian Government had received an answer from the Soviet Government on 3rd April to their telegram offering peace sent on 31st March. The Soviet Government accepted the proposal to commence negotiations, and suggested Moscow on loth April as the place and date. The recognition of Lithuanian independence would form one of the conditions, and the question of the assignment of this or that town would also be left to the Conference.The Soviet Government agreed with-the ethnographical principle.Mr. Ward went on to say that the Lithuanian Government considered the reference to the assigning of towns as either a misunderstanding of their claim for/ the provinces or a trick, and therefore sent the following reply: The Soviet Government must state unequivocally if the towns of Vilna and Grodno are recognized as Lithuanian. Further, that independence is an inalienable right of the people and cannot be considered as a matter for discussion.Telegraphiug again on 1.2th April [No. 50] he said that on the previous day a telegram had been received from the Soviet Government, stating that the independence of Lithuania w-as already recognized by Russia, and. need not be discussed at the Conference; but, nevertheless, it was necessary to render juridical the acceptance of independence in a practical form by the formal relinquishment of sovereign rights over a country  previously Russian. The Soviet Government declared that from henceforth it would recognize the independence of Lithuania, and promised that a juridical (? undertaking) should be given in the treaty about to be concluded. With regard to boundaries and the attribution of certain towns, the Soviet Government accepted the ethnographical principle as a basis; if the Lithuanian Government could bring the necessary data proving their claims, it could be sure that the Soviet Government would accept. If Moscow did not suit, the Soviet Government was ready to consider any proposal in this respect.Finland and the Soviet Government. In a telegram sent from Helsingfors on 12th April [No. 395] Lord Acton said that the Prime Minister had informed him that formal application Was being made to Poland for the selection of Danzig as a suitable place for peace negotiations between Finland and Poland ou the one hand, and Russia on the other. It was possible that Russia would repeat the demand made in 1918 for the cession of territory in the neighbourhood of Viborg. The two Karelian townships named previously had already been evacuated by the Soviet troops ; but nine remaining townships, which had proclaimed their independence from Russia, were still in Russian occupation, though inclined, according to the Prime Minister, to union with Finland.The Aland Islands. On 14th April Lord Acton reported [No. 403] that he had been informed by the Finnish Prime Minister that, according to information received from the Minister of the Interior, there was no truth in the report that a delegation from the Aland Islands was about to proceed to Paris. The Bill granting their autonomy would be taken in the first &quot;-reading at the session of the Diet on the following day.CHINA.Tibet [F.C.R., xiv., p. 3j. Mr. Lainpson telegraphed [No. 211] from Peking on 11th April stating that he had received a telegram from Mr. King, British Consul at Chefoo, that there were no signs of any contemplated attack on the Tibetans by the Yunnanese. There were reports,- however, that the Frontier Commissioner of the Province of Szeehuen, being desperately in want of funds, might force a quarrel with the Tibetans, so as&apos; to bring his needs more direct.lv to notice.GERMANY.The Ruhr District. On loth April Lord Curzon telegraphed [No. 119] to Lord Kihnarnock in Berlin that the German Charge d&quot;Affaires had stated that evening that, according to his latest, reports from Berlin, the situation in the Ruhr district was then fairly7 well in hand, and the German Government hoped to be able very shortly to withdraw the troops which they- had recently7 had to send into the neutral zone.   The principal difficulty they had to deal with was the state of public feeling
which had been aroused by the French occupation, which had at one time threatened the position of the Government, lie asked whether there was any hope of the French troops being withdrawn. The reply had been that it was for the German Government to bring about a speedy solution. As soon as the troops which they had sent into th * neutral zone in excess of the numbers authorized by the Note of 8th August 1919 had been withdrawn, the French would be found ready to evacuate the five towns.. Herr Sthamer had expressed his great satisfaction at this intimation, but fell-anxiety as to the continued presence in the zone of the 17,500 men authorized in the August agreement. This agreement had expired on 10th April, and tli^ request of the German Government to have the arrangement prolonged to 10th July next had so far remained without answer.It was explained that this request would be considered at the forthcomino-conference of the heads of the Allied Governments at San Remo, and that he could assure his Government that, pending such consideration, no objection would be made to the continued presence of the 17,500 German trooi^s in the zone.The Political Situation. The following instructions were telegraphed [No. 121] to Lord Kilmarnock on 14th April. You are authorized, in concert with your Allie?J to let it be known in such form as you may judge best, that the Allied Governments can certainly not tolerate the setting up of any Government that is not prepared loyally to cany out the Treaty of Peace, and that any recrudescence of disturbances or revolutionary movement can only have the effect of retarding, and even of renderino-impossible, any measures for assisting German economic revival and food supply, such as the Allied Governments have promised to consider.Bolshevik Cons-piracy.  Our representative at Munich, Mr. Smallbones, reported [No. 16] on 18th April that the Prime Minister had informed him that the Bavarian authorities had discovered a widespread conspiracy aiming at Bolshevik rule with the help of-Red Guards. The rising was to take place after the disarmament of the Einwolmerwehr. Complete details appeared to be available and would be published. The clanger of such a rising appeared to him to be real. \Yhile the reactionaries and the present Government were amenable to economic pressure, the Bolsheviks would not be, as there was abundance of supplies, available at the expense of the rest of the community. They would be sustained by the hope of the spread of their ideas into AYestern Europe, and of active support from Russia,Dissolution of the Einwohnerwehr. Lord Kilmarnock telegraphed [No. 242] the following information from Berlin, dated 19th April: The German Government has addressed a Note to the President of the Military Control Commission on the question of the Einwohnerwehr.- After describing at length the circumstances which led to the formation of this body, and denying that it has any military character which would enable it to be used against foreign countries, the Note states that, in view of pressure from the Allies, the German Government has decided to dissolve the Einwohnerwehr in its present form, but protests that the provisions of the Treaty of Peace render it impossible to assure maintenance of order. It points to the great clanger of a one-sided disarmament of . the population. It indicates that measures w-ould be taken to create a new reliable organization of a local character, and promises a further communication on the subject,&quot; HUNGARY.Jewish Complaint of Anli-Semitism. Telegraphing from Budapest on 9th April, [No. 227], Mr. Hohler reported that several prominent Jews had complained to him of the growth of anti-Semitism, and expressed serious alarm. They stated that they had already addressed themselves to Admiral Horthy.ancl the Prime Minister, in both of whom they had eveiy confidence, and by whom they had been very well received, but they feared they were not strong enough to impose order. He (Mr. Hohler) was doing everything possible to prevent an outbreak.Mr. Piohler added that he understood that this feeling against the Jews was mainly attributable to the continued rise in prices, which it had been hoped the stamping of notes would have tended to diminish. He had repeatedly reported his belief that the continuation of the blockade must eventually lead to serious eonse-quences, and he was realty at a loss to understand how townspeople managed to live to-day.
The Ruthenian Question.--On 7th April Mr. Hohler telegraphed [No. 2z0] from Budapest as follows : -I was visited to-day by a deputation of Ruthenes. They stated that their economic position was hopeless, and that the people were actually starving as well as suffering greatly from typhus ; that one of their Bishops had been driven from Eperjes, and another at Ungvar was threatened with like treatment; that they cannot come down according to immemorial custom into the Hungarian plains to work and sell their timber; and, finally, that in consequence of these conditions a very deep movement is taking place amongst the people Avhich they, as leaders, are unable to check, although they have done their utmost to point out the need for patience and delay. They put forward a claim to make their wishes known- by means of a plebiscite, and they beg that a commission should be sent to study7 the situation and report to the Peace Conference, There cannot be any doubts about their earnestness and sincerity.I pointed out, of course, that the aim of the Peace Conference had been to free them from Hungarian oppression, but they denied, rather bluntly7, that there had been anv, and said that the Baithenes who put forward this proposal at the Pitsburg Conference came from Galicia, and had no right whatever to speak for them.With reference to the foregoing, Sir George Clerk sent a telegram [No. 65] on 13th April concerning the Czecho-Slovak attitude towards the question, in which he said : -I discussed the Ruthene problem with the Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day7. Pie said the Czecho-Slovak Government were fully7 alive to the seriousness of the situation, and were doing all they7 could to remedy it. The question was complicated by political rivalries, as in Slovakia, but food was the vital consideration, and with its solution a great deal of political agitation would automatically7 disappear. Unfortunately7 the whole of Czecho-Slovakia was affected by the food problem, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs anticipated two or three very difficult weeks. At the end of that pjeriod, 5,000 waggons of American flour were clue, and the Government had decided to send large quantities of this supply to the Ruthenes. The Government was also asking the Rumanian Government to provide maize for the Ruthenes, while it had been decided to buy privately7 from Slovak peasants, at practically7 their own price, in order to get sirpplies of food which had hitherto remained obstinately7 concealed.   Dr. Alice Masaryk was to superintend the general relief of the Ruthenes.I have also seen Mr. Finlay Smith, who returned from Ruthenia this morning, where he has been distributing Red Cross clothing. He says the Czechs are doing their best, but their organization is faulty7. Local Jews manage to get food bought from Rumanians, but the authorities cannot get it for the peasants. The latter can get no work or money, as agricultural labourers are cut off from the Hungarian plains, and wood-cutters are idle because wood is not now floated down the rivers to the Theiss, while transport by7 rail is too costly7.ITALY.Coal. Sir George Buchanan telegraphed [No. 123] as follows from Rome on 11th April :-The Commercial Attache has just returned from a long interview with the two Ministers of Finance and the Treasury together.The Minister of the Treasury7 say7s that his departure for San Remo is uncertain, contrary7 to the announcement in the newspapers, but that in any case Signor Nitti intends to speak to the Brime Minister on the necessity7 for giving Italy7 more coal, and helping her to steady the exchange. I would most strongly urge that time be given to consider these two questions; and that every7 effort be made to afford help if possi ble-.. With regard to the coal question, Italy7 has for some months past been getting considerably less than half of the absolute minimum, which it seems agreed on all sides is necessary to keep her people in work, namely7, 500,000 tons a month. I consider that the question should be treated as one of high politics, which, if deferred, may7 represent a most sinister factor, endangering Italy&apos;s internal peace and fraught with unknown consequences for other nations. I would therefore go so far as to suggest respectfully that the possibility7 of recommending rationing should be considered, in order to facilitate the fulfilment of Italy7&apos;s requirements by7 deducting small quantities from other nations.15-3 B
JAPAN.The Japanese in Siberia. On the 6tli April Sir Charles Eliot reported from Tokio [telegram unnumbered] that on the previous day the War Minister had issued a statement supplementing the Governments declaration of its policy in Siberia to the effect that the Russians in Eastern Siberia were supplying arms to the Koreans ; that Japanese property in Siberia was suffering damage ; and that the Japanese lines of communication were menaced by the Russians. So long as such conditions prevailed, Japan could not evacuate, though she had no designs on Russia.This was in consequence of the announcement mentioned in the Press that on the 2nd April the Japanese &quot;Command er-in-Chief had presented an ultimatum to the Provisional Government demanding : (1) That there should be no interference with the transport, communications, &amp;c,of the Japanese troops. (2) The observance of  agreements hitherto concluded between the JapaneseGovernment and the Russian (? officials. (3) That there should be no restraint of persons assisting the Japanese forces. (4) The suppression of the secret anti-Japanese societies. (5) The suppression of anti-Japanese acts and statements.(6) That there should be no interference with the Japanese forces protecting the Japanese Ambassador (sic) in Korea.An official announcement had been issued that evening stating that (? Russian) attacks on the Japanese patrols at Vladivostock were in progress and that the Japanese Commander-in-Chief, regarding this as a pre-arranged hostile action, had from the morning of 5th April occupied strategic points in and near Vladivostock.In regard to this action of the Commander-in-Chief, Mr. Hodgson telegraphed from A^Iadivostock on 8th April [No. 59], saying that the Japanese maintained that they had no intention of interfering in the administration of the country, their action being intended solely for the protection of their troops. They had, Mr. Hodgson said, reinstated the the Zemstvo Government, and stated that. they considered themselves bound to secure it from aggression from whatever source threatened for the reason that they had deprived it of its military forces.Telegraphing again on 15th April [No. 137] Sir Charles Eliot said that the Minister of War had definitely assured the Military Attache that there was no ulterior motive for the action taken by the Japanese in Siberia ; the disarmament of the Russians being considered necessary as a (? military) precaution in view of the recent experience at (? Nicolaievsk). His Excellency further stated that Japan had absolutely no intention whatever of permanently occupying Siberian territory, and that the Japanese troops would be withdrawn as soon as a recognized Russian Government had been established, peace and order restored, and all menace to Korea and Manchuria removed.*   PERSIA.report of the Military Commission. Telegraphing from Teheran on 9th April [No. 190], Sir Percy Cox said that the Military Commission had completed their report and that, thanks to the tactful handling and conciliatory spirit shown by both sides, it had been signed by all the British and the Persian members. It consisted of seven chapters, the first five dealing with an examination of existing conditions, chapter six with the details of the proposed organization, and chapter seven with the action to be taken to give effect to the scheme. Briefly the recommendations were as follows : (1) The existing military forces such as South Persia Rifles, Cossack Division, Gendarmerie, &amp;c, to be formed into one uniform army under the Ministry of War. The Commission do not recommend the Persian Government taking over the Khorasan and Seistan Levy Corps as they stand with their present organization.(2) The organization of headquarters at Teheran under a British Organ izer-in-Chief with two branches, military and finance ; the former branch being-organized generally on British lines, the latter to deal with pay, audit, and purchase.
(3) Persia to be divided into seven military areas.(4) The total forces to be raised eventually to amount to approximately 70,000 men of all arms. Detailed establishments of all units are included in the report.(5) Military schools for the education of Persian officers to be established.(6) Medical and veterinary services with schools of instruction to-be formed.(7) The formation of an air service in close touch with any civil aviation whichmay be undertaken ; the establishment of six flights modified to suit localconditions.As the cost of the whole scheme is more than Persia can afford at present, the Commission recommend that reorganization be undertaken gradually, the following being the first steps to be undertaken : -(a) Reorganization of the War Office on a reduced scale.(6) Establishment of a cadet school.(c) Organization of five areas with fewer troops than proposed for the finaL scheme ; the remaining areas to have a small staff to enable the War Office to control them and to endeavour to reduce expenditure.(cT) Commencement of an air force.As regards requirements in British officers and non-commissioned officers, the Commission recommend that regimental units be divided into three categories, viz.  (1) Those existing units to which no British officers or non-commissioned .officers will be attached. These to be inspected by officers attached for the purpose to the staff of the General Officer Commanding the area,(2) Newly raised units to have three British officers and four non-commissioned officers attached.(3) One battalion, one cavalry regiment, and one battery -per area to form model units and act as a school for the further training of officers and non-commissioned officers. The infantry regiments to have seven British officers and 14 non-commissioned officers, and each other arm in proportion.As regards staffs, the War Office and Areas Commission recommend that British and Persian officers be mixed. A British officer to be Organizer-in-Chief, and each area to be commanded by a British officer. Officers will also be required for the cadet school, medical, and other auxiliary services. British officers to be lent to the Persian Government for four-year periods of service, and the non-commissioned officers&apos; period of service to be two years, exclusive of journeys to and fro and the period of leave at the conclusion. The air force personnel to be borrowed from His Majesty&apos;s Government and to be withdrawn gradually as Persians are trained. The Commission are unable to give the initial cost of the scheme owing to lack of information as to prices of munitions, stores, &amp;c., landed in Persia. The recurring annual cost of the reduced scheme would be approximately 15,000,000 tomans and of the complete scheme 25,000,000 tomans. The present annual cost of existing formations in Persia, exclusive of the police, is between 11,000,000 and 12,000,000 tomans.General Malleson s Successor. The Viceroy of India telegraphed on 10th April [No. 4537] informing the Secretary of State that Brigadier-General Leslie had been appointed Inspector-General of Communications in East Persia, in place of General Malleson, who had returned to India.Afghan Approaches. The Viceroy7 of India, telegraphing [437 S.] on the 14th April, in reference to the mission of an Afghan envoy to Teheran, says that the Indian Government has scanty-information regarding the envoy7&apos;s instructions. Little doubt is entertained but that the main burden of his message will be the AmiPs policy7 of effecting a reconciliation between the Sunnis and the Shiahs. It is thought- probable that he will try to sow the seeds of dissension between the Persians and ourselves, and to preach the advantages of an alliance with the Bolsheviks as saviours of the east from western imperialism and capitalism. At the same time a pro-Turk and pan-Islam policy7 may7 be expected to be favoured rather than a pro-Bolshevik. So long as no unfriendliness to ourselves is involved, the Viceroy7 points out that we can take no exception to efforts for increased friendliness between Persia and Afghanistan.15-3 C
POLAND.Armistice Negotiations. Sir Horace Rumbold reported on 6th April [No. 228] that the-Minister for Foreign Affairs had received a reply from M. Chicherin to the following effect: (1) He reiterated the demand for an armistice during the negotiations ; threw the responsibility for the prolongation of hostilities and further bloodshed on Poland, for having rejected the proposed armistice ; and suspected Poland of concealed strategical intentions.(2) He expressed his inability to understand the reasons of the Polish Govern-ment&apos;s insistence on Boryssow as the place of negotiations, with a merely local truce, and the refusal of a neutral country like Esthonia ; he proposed Petrograd or Moscow, or,-failing them, Warsaw.(3) He required the&apos;Polish Government to guarantee to the Russian delegation personal security and freedom of communications, correspondence, couriers, &amp;c.(4) He requested an immediate reply.The Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed Sir P. Loraine that morning that he objected to the tone of the Bolshevik telegram and that his reply would be some-what stiff in substance; he read out the draft reply to be sent to the above four points : (1). The Polish Government undertakes to abstain completely from all offensive action during the negotiations and leaves the Soviet Government to do what - it likes in that respect; but the Polish armies will of course defend them-selves if attacked.(2) As the Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs was asked in the original Soviet telegram to name a place for the negotiations, he maintains his choice of Boryssow, and explains as his reason for choosing it, that it possesses all necessary facilities as regards communications. (3) He promises all measures for free communications, &amp;c, in accordance with international usage and courtesy, and points out that it has not been the habit of Poland to detain foreign plenipotentiaries. (4) He expresses his regret that negotiations cannot now begin on 10th April,but undertakes to do everything possible to accelerate their inception. Telegraphing again on 12th April [No. 241], he said that the Soviet Government had categorically rejected Boryssow as the place for negotiations, and had repeated a wireless message despatched to the Allied Governments asking jkhern to intervene with the Polish Government with a view to inducing it to alter its decision and to agree to another place.In a further telegram [No. 212] sent on 13th April, Sir Horace reported that the Poles thought that the Bolsheviks were playing for time, and were not seriously contemplating peace negotiations at the present moment; so that if they gave way in regard to the meeting place, other objections would be raised.RUSSIA.Message from Lord Curzon to M. Chicherin and Reply. On 11th April the following messagewvas sent [No. 199] to the British Consul at Reval for transmission to M. Chicherin : Having realized for some time that the military struggle in South Russia could not be indefinitely prolonged, and being convinced that its. continuance could only be attended by further loss of life, and by a serious set-back to the recovered tranquillity and prosperity of Russia, I have exerted my utmost influence with General &quot;Denikin to induce him to abandon the contest, and have ptromised him that if he did, I would use my best efforts to make peace between his forces and yours, and to secure the safety of the rank- and file of his followers, and the population of the Crimea in general.General Denikin finally decided to act upon this advice, and has left Russia, resigning his command to General Wrangel, who has stated his willingness to accept the mediation which I offered.
I therefore communicate with, you at once to request you, in the interests both of Russia and of humanity, to issue orders for the termination of hostilities, and to grant a general amnesty upon the disbandment of the Volunteer Army.^ If the latter are not assured of conciliatory treatment, they are,T understand, while no longer capable of any serious offensive northwards, prepared, nevertheless, and still able to maintain themselves in being, and to offer a stubborn resistance for some months to come in the Crimea. This is an alternative which can be of no possible advantage to either party.      ^ ^     -If, on the other hand, you are willing to consider equitable terms, I shall be glad to know the conditions on which and the means by which you would propose that they should be taken in hand, and I wdll use my best efforts for their acceptance.This country takes a special interest in the fate of Denikm&apos;s army ; that army represented the Russian elements that stood by us in the Great War, in which Russia originally participated as an ally, and we have been in honour bound to stand by them to the end. Now that they have failed, we must equally use our best endeavours to save them from destruction as well as disaster.From the point of view of Russia, the reasons for a pacific and honourable settlement at this juncture are not less strong. We are expecting the arrival here in a few days&apos; time of your delegates to discuss the ways and means by which trade between our-two countries may be resumed. Such intercourse is vital for the economic recovery of Russia ; as long, however, as civil Avar is proceeding in Russia, it cannot be undertaken with any reasonable prospect of success.It may further be pointed out that if the commencement of these negotiations were to synchronize Avith military carnage in South Russia, or with the execution of severe reprisals upon prisoners of war, or upon those who have played a prominent part in the struggle, the negotiations could not be prosecuted in face of a public opinion that would result from any such proceedings, and they would accordingly be doomed to failure from the start.I shall be glad if you Avill favour me with an early reply to these proposals.To this M. Chicherin replied on 15th April through Mr. Porter at ReA-al [No. 75], saying :  The Russian Government welcomes Avith pleasure the fact that the British Government has addressed itself to it for the solution of a question which, once successfully solved, Avill bring us much nearer to the removal of the hindrances for a complete good understanding between Russia and Great Britain. As for the support which, according to the British Government^ own statement, ifc-gave to the adver-saries of the Russian Government, we aviII not at the present juncture enter into a discussion as to whether the motives given by the British GoA*ernment for this support could still hold good; seeing that your communication clearly shoAArs that, after these Russian elements have been saved from reprisals, you Avill consider your liabilities towards them at an end, and a fresh page Avill open in the Anglo-Russian relations. The whole complex of questions affecting these relations having been in a general way connected in your communication with the specialism at stake, we on our part state that all the multiple questions Avbich have to be examined between the two GoArernments cannot be disconnected, and have to be approached on the basis of your communication. The Russian Government is of the same opinion as the British Government as to the recognition of the fact that the economic, recovery of Russia is useful for other countries also, and that it would be hindered by the continuance of hostilities, the latter being conducted at present on a larger scale by the Polish GoA-ernmeiit than by the remnants of Denikin&apos;s forces, and the cessation of these hostilities being vital, as the British GoA-ernment rightly states, to the economic recovery of Russia. Fully sympathizing with the appeal to humanity made by the British GoA^ernment in the present case. are refer to that of the ex-members of the Hun garian Soviet Government now detained in Austria,.and feel bound to demand their free journey to Russia, for which we hope the British GoArer.nment will exert its influence. The Russian Government is of opinion that the solution of those and other questions facing the two Governments can be bes&apos;t obtained by direct negotia-tions between our representative, Litvinoff, in London Avith the British Government, and it confidently expects that none but favourable results aauII emanate therefrom to the reciprocal advantage of Russia and Great Britain.On 21st April.the Foreign Office reported to Lord Curzon at San Remo [No. 26] that M. Chicherin had telegraphed through ReA^al stating that Soviet troops had been
shelled by British ships irj the Black Sea, aud that this had been confirmed by the Admiralty.In consecpience of this episode M. Chicherin sent the following Marconi wireless telegram to Lord Curzon on 20th April: The Russian Government cannot conceal its astonishment, in view of the fact that the British Government has found it possible to base a diplomatic step of great importance upon what, with reference to private individuals, would be perhaps described as inadecptate ascertaining of facts. Our answer to Earl Curzon&apos;s telegram, dated 11th April and received 12th April, was mainly issued on 14th April - and received by the British Consul-General in Reval on 15th April, whereas the Carnarvon wireless station four clays long refused just at (^That time to answer the calls of the Moscow1 station, and the latter did like-(^wise not succeed to send our message to Carnarvon through Paris. The pauses, therefore, owing to which this answer had not reached the British Foreign /Office on the 18th, are outside our sphere of influence. It is the more to be deplored that the British Government has deemed it opportune to proceed at once with foregoing military threats hardly appropriated for attaining the appeasing results originally aimed at and to adopt an aggressive attitude endangering even the establishment of trade relations between western and eastern Europe which will be of such value to both parts. Whilst not submitting to threats, Soviet Russia does not swerve from its persistently pacific policy, and we maintain even now our conciliatory proposals laid clown in our message of .14th April. The Russian Government holds the view that all the questions involved can only be successfully solved by the direct negotiation suggested in its above-mentioned despatch, and entertains the hope that early initiation of these negotiations will in time dispel all the unfavourable circum-stances still hindering the establishment of peaceful relations between Great Britain and Russia or even sometimes aggravating these relations.SYRIA.Syria a Nation.
