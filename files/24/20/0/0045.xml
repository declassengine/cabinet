      As a result of the conference held at the Ministry of Labour on the 24th May and subsequent correspondence with Sir George Askwith,  the delimitation of the several spheres of activity of the Ministry of Labour and my Department were outlined  in  a draft which was to the following effect, viz:-     That I  should, when approached by both parties  to a dispute,  act as conciliator  and endeavour to  settle it by  the  exercise  of  influence and friendly advice.  Should I be unable  to  do this, or should I in the first instance consider  the matter more suitable for the Ministry ofLabour, I should refer^to that Department for such action as might be considered necessary.  Further, in the case of arbitration under a neutral chairman appointed by theChief Industrial Commissioner, I should be kept closelyin touch with the matter,  and the. agreement or decisionshould be subject to ratification.by me.     Ifihen howsver the outlines of this proposal werecommunicated by me to my Advisory Board, they evoked un-animous opposition,  and, I regret to say, a certain  measureof hostility to the  idea of the Ministry of Labour inter-vening in disputes in the coal-mining industry.  Prom thevery first meeting of my Advisory Board on the 7th Marchboth sides, that is, both masters and men, have
urged the view that I should accept and retain jurisdictionin the case of all labour disputes in the coal-miningindustry, and endeavour to settle them either by friendlyadvice or formal arbitration,   This view I have throughoutresisted, believing it to be the wish of the Governmentthat the Ministry of Labour (comprising the ChiefIndustrial Commissioners Department) should assume atleast the larger part of these functions.  The feelingof ay Advisory Board however has been so frequently andso emphatically expressed that I do not consider itpossible any longer to act in contradiction to it.     The Board consists cf a very representative selectionof men,-(1)   Representing-Coal laasters:     Mr. Adam Mmmo,  resident: of the Mining Association          of Great Britain.     Sir Thomas Ratcliffe-Ellis, Secretary of the same          Association,     Mr. Arthur P; Pease, Chairman of Pease and Partners          Limited.,     Mr, Hugh Bramwell  Managing Director of the Great           wes tern Collie ry Company,     Mr. F.J. Jones, Chairman of the Rothervale Collieries           Limited,     Sir Francis Brain. Colliery Owner,  Drybrook,           Gloucestershire,     Mr. 0.1. Rhodes, Mining.Engineer of Rotherham, and           Director of a nuuber of Collieries in lorkshire           and elsewhere.                                -and  (2).      Repr es en t ing  the miners:     Mr, Robert Smillie  President of the Miners1           Federation of Great Britain, and
The Right Honourable Thomas Ashton,  ?.Ct?  Secretary of     the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain,Mr.Stephen Walsh M.P., Parliamentary  Secretary  to the     National Service Department,Mr*V*rnon HartMr.Herbert Sidth, i^wMr * James Robson, Secretary W the Durham Minersf Pederat ion,Mr., W. Straker, Secretary of the Nortlaimberland Miners1     Federation.     In view of the  unanimous opposition expressed by thisbody of men to the suggested Agreement with the Iftnistry ofLabour outlined above, I felt compelled to reopen the matterand accordingly on the Z6thyinstant  in company with Sir BichardRedmayne, I mat Mr.John Hodge and Sir George Askwith, and thisminute is the result of that interview.     The view expressed after long discussion  by the Boardwhen I reported to them the proposals referred to above may besummarised as follows:-(l)       In the first instance, assuming local machinery to                 *                               should     be exhausted, it was desirable  that both  sides/ask me  to     endeavour to settle the dispute by acting as a concili-     ator consulting vjhen necessary  my Advisory Board.(2)       If I failed to settle the  dispute, then I and my     Board would suggest to both parties that  they should go     to arbitration, (uhen I would appoint the arbitrator)  in     which event any party who refused to comply with this     suggestion would place himself  in a very  invidious position.     I must say that, having regard  to the attitude of myAdvisory  Board, in my opinion the  solution summarised in  theabove, two paragraphs is the one most likely to make forindustrial peace. My Department has no wish to increase itsfunctions in the matter of disputes, indeed if it could avoiddoing so it would be relieved of a large amount of work andavoid responsibility in the event  of stoppages; but in the  cir-cumstances I feel it my duty to press for this solution. Itmay be objected that disputes are  better settled by some person
 or department  who  is  quite  detached  from the parties; to  the dispute,  hut I would, point  out  that  I  am not in a position of an employer of the workmen  engaged in  this industry,  hut am- rather in the  posit ion of;a super-employer who  employs hoth the masters and the men,  Applications for advances  or re- duct ions  in wages  are not mads  to me hut &quot;by the one  party to the other/and they are granted only subject to my consent, I have discussed with my  Advisory Board the erclusion from the arrangement above suggested of disputes affecting coke- workers,  hut it appears that the question  of  their wages is inextricably mixed up with  those of  the miners  and in many cases comes before the same Conciliation Board. There are however,  I believe, one or  two  coke-oven companies having no: connection wi th. collieries,  and these  may  well  be excluded from the  scope of  the arrangement now  under discussion.      Apart however from that, I see  no alternative but to acquiesce in the emphatic opinion of my Advisory Board, that. the whole control  of  labour disputes,  whether it consists in the giving of  friendly advice or in  inducing the parties to go to arbitration  and to  abide  by the  resulting award, should remain in the  hands of my department.  &apos;     The  present situation of dual  control,  as I think  Mr,John Hodge  and  Sir George Askwith will agree,  is not satisfactory.  At  present it can easily  happen  that one week I am dealing with a&apos; dispute the next  week  Sir  G-eorge  Askwith is  appointing  an arbitrator, and a little later the affair is back  in my hands because one of the parties refuses to  abide by  the award and the Ministry of Labour has  no power to compel them  to do so. Neither have I any legal power  but my  Advisory Board assure  me that the disputants  look to me as the supreme  authority who should influence them in  the matter and are more  1 i kely to list en to my counsels of peace  than to those of  another Department.                                     GUI CALTIffiOP,   ..-                          . (4) .  :  .  -    &apos;         12/6/17 ...
