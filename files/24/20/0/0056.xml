T/EEta   REPORT   ON    GERMANY,..**i** H*i*i*MMtMWIMM*           ************ MPJ   July 10th  to  Jujg 17th. 191*.              It  is of  course  impossible at  the  present moment   to explain all  ihathae happened in BerlAn during the last   ten days;  it is quite obvious  from the German papers that we   have received,  that it is not clearly understood,  even in   Berlin.1.             The chief reasons for the obscurity are:   (l)   Important debates have taken  place in what  is called the   Main Committee  of the Reichstag;  this committee  is apparently   practically the whole Reichstag sitting in secret  session.   It is characteristic  of German  polltics that the confidence in   the  discretion  of the members has been frequently  abused  end   that many  reports of  what happened  appeared in the preBB, but   coming as  they  do from partisan sources, they  are  necessarily   very incomplete and partial.   (2)   We know nothing of one of the prime  factors  in  the  situa-   tion, via: the  action and attitude  of  the  litoperor.    We have   not the slightest indication whether ha has imposed his personal   will or whether he has been rather  dragged hither  and thither   by different influences.   (3)   We do not know  the result of  the conferences which took   place about a fortnight ago with Kindenburg and ludendorff and   the German jUmperor in Austria;   it  is, to  say  the  least, prob-   ahle, that the Austrian Government pressed that nothing should   he done which would impede a speedy peace;   if so, it would   appear as  though they had found a strong obstacle to  the policy   they desired to pursue in the German General Staff, and it%  would be natural, although it is an unproven conclusion, from^EPARMCBKT Qg IHJPOBMTIOff        IH2ELLICENC  BUREAU.AGW/012.
 this, that they tried to attain their objeots by stimulating the opposition which has arisen from the Reichstag.            There was a double element in the crisis;  two different points were involved:- (a) the demand for internal reform, viz; the reform of the Prussian franchise and the establishment of Parliamentary Government of the Empire, and (b) the aadessity for a speedy peace, and, arising from this, the aocegtanoe, in some form or another, of the idea of peacewithout annexations.   The complications which have arisen areto a laj^e^extent^du^                            these twomotives.                                           ,&apos;W-;- -\y            The machinery by which the crisis had been broughtabout is the cooperation of the four great parties, which oon-stitute the whole of the Reichstag, with the exception of thetwo extreme parties - the Conservatives and the Minority 80-cialists;  these parties are the Centre, which numbers 91, theRadicals 45,  the National liberals 45,  and the fc&amp;jority Social-ists 89,  out of a total of 397.            It will be remembered that at the last meeting ofthe Reichstag in May, a Bloc had been formed of the first threeof these parties, which supported the Chancellor in his refusalto state his terms of peace or to take a definite position asbetween the Annexaticnists and the Non-AnnexationistB.   Thisgave him the requisite support as against the annexationiste ofthe Right ani the Socialists.   What has now happened is thatthese parties have withdrawn their support from the Chancellor,have united with the Socialist Majority,  and have formed astill larger Bloc, which was no  longer content simply tosupport him and the Government,  but determined to take mattersinto their own hands and to enforce their will upon the Govern-ment.   It comes to this,  that a majority so large  that it mightclaim to represent  the  great  mass of the German people,
*%ut forward the demand that they should direct the policy of the Empire in the most vital matters and that the Government ;i should follow their advice.             (The very faot that this situation arose made the Chancellorfs position an impossible one.   He had failed in that which has always been regarded as the chief function of the Chancellor,  the management of the Reichstag, and the Em- peror found himself confronted with the situation that he must either let the management of affairs drop from his hands-, and thereby in fact become a Constitutional Sovereign, subject to the will of the parliamentary majority, or he must get rid of the Chancellor and find someone who would repair his failure *             The most remarkable thing is the complete collapse of the personal position of the Chancellor.    He seems to have had no one to  stand up for him.   He has of course long lost tbe confidence of the Right;   now we find that he was subjected to the strongest criticism from the left.    The failure is a personal one;  we can scarcely say that it is an attack upon his policy,  for  the basis of all the criticism is that he had no policy;   but  the very fact that he had no policy seems to have led to  his  fall - as no  one could put any trust in him. From every side  there arose the complaint  that the nation could not (to on  with the war  unless it had someone on whom it could depend for c-  bold positive action-   This  complaint is most strongly  voiced in the Liberal papers. ;     ^ !             If we analyse what had happened,  we  find that on Friday,  July 6,  Erzberger,  urged,  it is said,  by the Austrians, began the attack in the  speech which was described in the  last report.    The  Chancellorfs answer on Saturday  was cle&amp;rly a failure.   The one  thing we learn clearly  about  it was  that he refused  to accept the  idea of peace  without annexations;  we may,  I think,  take  it that he  refused to make  the  definite declaration  which the Frankfurter  lias  been asking for, that it
 was  not the intention to annex Belgium.   The result was a complete collapse.   Sunday was occupied with prolonged meetingB between the representatives of the four great parties; they seem to have formed themselves into a kind of Committee, which was the instrument through which they attempted to force their will upon the Government.   This is, I think, a quite unprecedented situation in the German Empire.            Another meeting of the Committee was held oniM&amp;h&amp;ay;  the Chancellor made another- speech, which seems tohave been equally ineffective.   What is most remarkable is that we find the leaders of the allied parties refusing therequest of the Government that they should vote the requiredcredits and discuss the political situation afterwards.    Oneis almost reminded oi the classical struggle for parliamentarygovernment in ilngland when we find the Gormen Reichstag insist-ing that discussion of the political situation should come firstand the voting of supplies postponed. RUSSIAN REFORM:            For the&quot;moment, the Government turned the discussionon to the reform of the Prussian Constitution.    During  Mondayand Tuesday,  everyone was waiting for  the  decision on thispoint.    The  Emperor,  quite according  to Prussian custom,  sum-moned the Crown Prince,  for the old tradition survives that  inany important alteration of the Prussian Constitution, the heirto the  throne must be consulted;   these  matters  are  looked onas though they were matters affecting  the  integrity  of an  en-tailed  estate.    The decision as  to this was  published on  V/ednes-day,    On that day a decree was issued by  the Emperor  by whichhis Easter message was  expanded;   in that  he  had already agreedto direct and secret suffrage,  he  now  added equal  suffrage;  thisremoved the criticism that the  Reform  already promised would haveleft room for serious inequalities in  voting.    He also  deter-
     mined that the reform should be  introduced in time to  become  y effective before  the  next elections  (elections are due next     spring,  but of course this does  not  really mean much,  for, no    a&amp;oubt, if the  war continues,  the present  Chamber will  be pro-  -;;: longed).10.             With the proclamation  of the  decree concerning Prus-     sian Reform, it seemed for the moment as  though the crisis     would resolve  itself,  that the more  Conservative Prussian     lillitlsters would resign, as would probably Zimmermann and     Eelfferloh, but that  the  Chancellor  would remain.    It was     under the influenoe of this view that the last report  was     written,  with  its  incorrect anticipation  that Bethmann-Hollweg     would probably remain.    Instead of  being settled,  however,     the  orisis broke out again with  increased violence.    The Em-    peror^s decree  had in  fact, while settling  the Prussian ques-     iion, left the  two others,  which are at any rate for the    moment of infinitely greater importance,  undetermined.  These    are  (a) the demand for parliamentary government in  the Empire,    and  (b) the proposal by the Bloc Parties  to pass a  resolution    as to war aims.11.          [ On both these,  the Bloc came into definite opposition    with the  Government, and  it was apparent  that  the Chancellor     completely failed  to be able to control the situation or to    bring sufficient influence  to bear upon the Reichstag.    It    was  his failure in this which made his resignation inevitable.12. PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT IN THE SMPIRE:              Prussian Reform is only a part of what we may call    the Democratic programme.    The other and more important part    is that of establishing parliamentary Government in the    Empire, and in fact* Prussian Reform is  valued only in so far    as it removes what has hitherto been one of the chief obsta-    eles  to this;  so  long as  the present.Prussian Franchise remains,    there is no means  by which the Liberal Parties can  control the                                   -                      Prussian
 Government, and the Prussio.il Government has practically com- plete control in the Bundesrat;  it therefore controls also both the administration and the legislation of the Empire, and the Reichstag is, as experience has shown, practically helpless.            The most remarkable point in the development of the last weeks has been the decision and energy with which the Frankfurter Zeitung and the Berliner Tageblatt, the two chief Liberal papers, have come forward With the demand for the imme- diate introduction of Parliamentary Government.   In regard to the Frankfurter Zeitunft&apos;. this is probably their answer to the action of the military in&quot; putting them under a special ban and refusing them permission to discuss political matters.   Thisnew attitude has brought them at once into close cooperationwith the Majority Socialists and they have for the time securedalso the adhesion of the Centre and the National-Liberals.   Weget then this Bloc.,  which represents practically almost thewhole of the Reichstag, and this has found expression in constantmeetings of representatives of the allied parties.;  these meet-ings have obviously become a very important new factor in thepolitical situation.            It will be remembered that the Frankfurter, in anarticle on Friday,  said that Parliamentary Government must notbe merely decided upon, it must be established by an act.    Thisseems to have been the watchword.    The Vossische fa Liberalpaper,  which at the  same time takes a much more  conservativeline on peace terms)  says on Sunday:    &quot;The anxiety has  not been weakened.  It has rather been  strengthened.   For  the attitude  of  the Chancellor  in the  Committee shows clearly that he  is  far removed from taking  the only road which at this critical moment  can lead to a  solution.   So much the more must the Reichstag be deter-  mined to undertake  the responsibility for that which  has  now  been done.  The Reichstag is now placed before a  task which  previously no  German Reich stag has  had&quot;*to solve.&quot;     -  J    &quot;The position of  the Reichstag &quot;determines GermanyrB future.  It has in its  hands to  change the system which  cannot continue  any longer,  because there  is  dissatisfaction with  it both on  the Right end  on the Left.    In  Germany,  as anywhere else,
   Government can &quot;be carried on with the parties of the Right   or the parties of the heft.    It is absurd to attempt to   govern against both the feight and the Left.   This,  there-   fore ,  is the absurd position in which the German Imperial   Government is permanently situated.&quot; The writer,  George Bernhard, then continued to  point out that the difficulties in Germany arise from the  weakness of the Government;   this produces the unreal distinction between annexationists and anti-anherationistsj   it comes to this, that he  wants the Reichstag to get the control  into its own hands in order to proclaim the essential unity  of Germany and to insist that the policy of the  country should be carried on with more ability.    In the next  number,  Monday,  the same note is continued,  with a  toudh of  triumph:   &quot;If the Reichstag does not give  way at  the  last  moment,  the   initiative  has  been transferred from the  Chancellor,  who,   according to  the  letter  oi the  Cons titution,  is  charged   with it to  the  Reichstag. \ People will welcome  or regret   this aocording  to their  position towards  the  demands  for the   Parliamentary form  of Government.   fforysince yesterday,   without any new progress beins  drafted^by the Constitutional   uommittee, the German]Parliament is determining  the course   of ftrman policy.  gill yesterday. Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg   still had it in his power to  keep for the Emperor the initia-   tive in its full scope, if he had offered his resignation.  Apparently he did not properly estimate the tone of the  Reichstag, he believed that he had to do once more with one   of the storms in a tea-oup, of which we have had so many.  Anyhow he depended on disturbing the unity of the parties  and thereby strengthening his own position, by a speech in   the full House.&quot;           Whether or not this  view of what happened is acorrect one,  the fact that it is so ostentatiously put forwardwould of itself be Sufficient to frighten the Emperor,  theArmy and the Government - using the latter word in its widestsense of the administrative authorities.   They are heredefinitely told that .the deoision has been taken from theChancellor, from the Emperor himself, and transferred to theReichstag.   Parliamentary fcOTernment has  n fact begun.That there was a great detel of  truth in it is obvious fromthe varied accounts we get ef the continued sittings of theinformal inter-party Committee;  they sat most of Sunday,  sent
^d^rtst-lons&quot; to ^e^Clak^                    -iwclid^ions - to- beput before tbe-Reiciifstag, and were in all ways acting as if  they were going to take upon1 their own hands the  full res-ponsibility for determining the- future course of affairs.PEeoim^OH AS TO UAB AIMS:         .  The ohicf subjset of tha^diJBousBionB&apos;of this  JointParty- Committee, has. been, war,polJLcy;  the ob j ect apparentlyhas been that if these four parties, which comprise over 300members, could agree on and pass a resolution, this, repre-senting as it would the whole of the German nation, with theexception of the Conservatives, and perhaps of the MinoritySocialists, v/ould have the very greatest weight and wouldreally compel the Government to accept it.   It is quiteclear that the point of any such resolution would be directedagainst the Pan-Germans;  we have evidence from all sidesthat their action and that the excessive demands of theArnexatlordsts  have causedprofomit irritation    It is nowgenei-al3y:--xecog ise&amp; that the latter do eno^mious harm&apos;to theGerman  canse,  and the combined parties wish to put, what theyconsider the German case,  in a moderate form;   this wouldserve two objects.    Firstly, it would do away with what theyallegs  is a misconception of President Wilson and other alliedstatesmen, that there is a difference between the\ German Gov-emmeut and the German nation;   they would aim at making itclear that the nation was whole-heairtsd in favour of prosecut-Ing the war so far as it was for the defence of German terri-tory and essential; Gorman economic interests;   it would there-fore be an answer to the demand of Prance that Alsace Lorraineshould be restored,  to the: peace terms of the Allies  thatAustria should be destroyed,  to the Paris resolutions whiehimplied the permanent economic isolation of Germany,  and theBritishi demands that Germany should be deprived of all her

Germany took up arms in order to defend     liberty, independence, and territorial integrity.f0IThe     Reichstag stands for peace and understanding and fcfee the     lasting conciliation of nations.    Annexations, political,     economic, and financial  oppressions are contradictory to     such peace.    The Reichstag rejects all plans which aim at     economic separation and the  instigation of hostility amongst     nations after the war.   The freedom of the seas must be     guaranteed.    Only an economic peace will prepare the soil     for friendly relations between nations.    The Reichstag will     energetically foster the creation of the organisations of     international law.    As  long,  however,  as hostile G-overa-     ments do not accept such a peace, as long as they threaten     conquest and violence against  Germany and her Allies,  the     German nation to a man will  be united and will stand un-     shaken fighting until right  of existence end evolution are     secured for  it end its Allies.   The German nation in its     unity is invulnerable    The Reichstag knows that it agrees     in  this respect with the men who,  in a heroic struggle, are     protecting this country.   The lasting gratitude of the     whole of the nation is assured to them.&quot;              There is difficulty in getting  the adhesion of the   national Liberals,    The Party Ab much divided;  the Leader,  - Bassexmann, is ill,  and the Ri.?ht &quot;tfiag of  the Party,  which   represents the great  industrial  firms,  is  apparently rslus-       &apos;                                  /to   tant to agree  to anything  which  impliesAannexations;   but it   is suggested that they are  strongly influenced by the desire   to annex the Briey and Longwy  Mining Districts in H.ii.France.   Even without their adhesion, the Bloc would have  a majority   in the Reiohstag,  but the majority  would not  be so large  es   to earry the overwhelming moral  influence  which is desirable.              We  have  no clear statement as to-- tfce^ poo^ltioa which   Bethmann-Hollweg teak; up towards this question;   it is  clear,   however,  t])at  it aroused opposition among  the Military.  -iti&amp;cenburg zM. Ludendorff,  who had  left Berlin on Monday, were  -again&quot; summoned;   this is attributed- to  the influence  of  the
 Crown Prince.   On Friday they received the leaders of the parties.   Here we may note a point of form;   the Main Com- mittee of the Bcichstaf; had expressed the wish that Hindenburg and ludendorff should attend at the Committee;  instead of that the leaders of the parties went to see them, presumably at the building of the General Staff;  i.e. they did not descend to go down to tho Reichstag, but summoned the leaders of the Reichstag to them.   v/e do  not know tho result of the interview, except so much as we may gather irom the fact that the proposals for bringing in the  resolution have been con- tinued since, then;   we may therefore conclude that it failed to bring ebcut an agreement.    The Reichstag Majority remained therefore in definite opposition to the military,    These interviews took piece on Friday;   the Chancellor resigned on&apos;: Saturday.: ::&quot;.            It is clear,  therefore, that the reason for his resignation was that he failed in  that which is regarded by the Emperor as the  chief duty of a Chancellor, viz:  the management of the Reiohstag.            Uo information is available about the new Chan- cellor,  except that which appears  in the press;   it is in- terestin^ to notice,  however,  that the prospect of his being appointed was first mentioned in a Berlin telegram to the . KheiniscTi Wcstfalische Zeitunff,  on Tuesday,  July 10;   the. following words appear:      -                     ,       \-     &quot;In view of his extraordinary  oratorical power and his   temperament,  he is considered as suitable  for  solving the   internal difficulties&quot;. The important point,  so  far as our knowledge at  present 30es, is that when he was appointed in M&amp;roh head  of the Prussian Jtood Administration,  he  delivered  a speech which made a great sensation at the time,  and he  set  to.work with great  energy, and in particular showed great determination not to spare  the Agrariaja.    In view of the  grave dissatisfaction among the
 working men,  this is a mrtter ef the first importance.  Presum- ably hiB  task will he to carry out the internal administration with special  reference to all questions of food, War supplies, etc, so  as to hack up the military.   It appears, therefore, as  if,for the moment, the optimistic view of the war has gained the upper hand;  it is still believed that Germany has suffi- clent reserves to continue the war, and that she will be more able to &quot;hold outu then the Allies,   i&apos;or this reading of the situation, they will depend upon the belief, which is strongly held in Germany, that France is at the end of her resouroes, that there is great dissatisfaction in Italy, and that the English nation will be so severely crippled by the continued effect of the submarines, that the time will soon come when they will not be able to import sufficient food and sufficient materials for the supply of war material to the front.   It is probably believed in Germany that the British working-classes will not stand the kind of hardships to which the Germans have beoome accustomed;   the fighting strength of the army will therefore be diminished and the time will soon come when peace negotiations oan be begun under oircumstances very favourable to the Central Powers,    If this view is right, Michaelis1motto will be Durohhalten.*  However,  that we shall see When hemakes his promised speech tomorrow.    He will have to calm the apprehensions to which Erzberger gave voice,  and he will have also to meet the Austrian desire for a speedy peaoe.           It may be allowed to add a word of warning.    Itmust not be assumed that even if the Reichstag were to  get  theupper hand,  and if the  government accepted their resolution:, that this  would necessarily mean any slackening in the  proseeu-tion of the  war,  . Ihe  chief object  of many of those  who  havebeen working for liberalising the Government  is in fact toenlist the full force of the patriotism  of the  nation by  remov- ing the causes of internal  dissension.    Germany would  probably

In order officially to correct  this impression, the German people now desire to issue,  through the Beicbstag, elected on the freest and most demo-  dratio franchise oi the world, an unambiguous declaration  of will regarding their war aims.    Germany^ enemies must - &amp;e made to realise clearly that they are waging war with  the entire German people, which is resolved to  continue  fighting for freedom and independence to the last  drop  of           She success of the constitutional  movement wouldtherefore not necessarily weaken Germany in! tbe conduct ofthe war;  what it would do would be to produce a  state ofmind favourable to an agreed peace on  &quot;moderate&quot;  terms.Whether such an agreed peaoe would be welcome, would psreeum-ably, to a large extent, depend on the question whether thepopularisation of the Government was permanent, and whethermilitarism fin the sense of the policy of the State beingdirected,  even in time of peace,  by the military)  wasfinally overthrown.
