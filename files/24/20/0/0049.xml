Foreign Trade Department.CONFIDENTIAL.[132255/F.T.D.]  it^0 fl4fp MEMORANDUM  ON TRADE WAR.                                   SYNOPSIS.    THE potential power of the weapon with which the economic  strength  of theAllies endows them is generally admitted, but the practical problem of converting asfully as  possible this potential power into actual measures, calculated to hasten peace,requires close and continuous attention with a view to concrete action.    By  means of the Statutory List very effective action of one particular kind, namely,destroying German trade and leaving open channels for the recuperation of the Allies,is being  taken, but an endeavour is made in this memorandum to show :     1. That  the  policy underlying  the  Statutory  List is capable of very considerabledevelopment,  if the full  significance of these  novel trade war measures is sufficientlyrecognised.    This development might take the form of-      (a.) Vigorous prosecution of our Statutory List policy by           (1.) Provision of better facilities to enable non-enemy (preferably British)                 firms to replace the trade of firms  which have been  put on  the                 Statutory List;          (2.) A declaration from the United States Government  of their intention to                 adopt a similar policy.      (6.) Early  establishment  of the British Trade Corporation and a British Metal             Bank.      (c.) Creation of a  committee (acting on a similar principle to that guiding the             Restriction of Enemy Supplies Committee) to be supplied  with funds to             embark upon schemes on a  not necessarily commercial basis to (l) wreck             German, trade  prospects after the war and (2) to secure control of raw             material now used most largely in Germany.    2. That measures should be taken now to exploit the alarm already manifested byGermany at the idea of post helium trade war and the retardation of their  commercialrecovery by the  creation of a weapon to permit of such a war being waged moreeffectively if  so desired.   There may be differences of opinion as to the expediency ofusing such a weapon when forged, but there should be as little disagreement as regardsthe desirability of its  creation as  there would be in  regard  to the  desirability ofmaintaining an army and a navy.

                      &apos; -;.      &apos;MEMORANDUM.     Sir W. Townley has recently forwarded a large number of reports on the German. press and on German opinion as gathered from other sources, from which it&quot; appears that very serious attention is being given to the difficulties and dangers in the way of German commercial  recovery after the war.   A summary of our information will he found in the first appendix to this memorandum.     It is clear from the reports  that, at present at least, the primary ground of alarm is trade war after the cessation  of hostilities.   This possibility and its use as a means of pressure designed to shorten the  war and to secure adequate peace terms raises a variety of complicated and difficult questions.   Its discussion is postponed to a later stage  in this memorandum, since,  whatever  conclusion  may  be reached  on  the exploitation of that particular alarm, we have other means of economic pressure which are  also calculated  to be  effective, and which present fewer difficulties.   The-German alarm is based on realisation of the difficulties, of commercial recuperation;  and the emphasis on post-war measures  is due simply to  the fact that therein lies the most obvious as weli as the greatest  danger.  Alarm would be equally aroused by  action during the war, provided this was clearly of such a character as to damage the prospects of post-war recuperation.*  Given the present state of anxiety,  German acceptance of possible terms might well  be brought substantially nearer by measures which had this nature.   What is required is  real  damage to the prospects of recuperation, damage by measures: which  were obviously  bound  up; with the duration of hostilities,  and damage which was of a progressive  character, so that every additional month of war meant an increase in the harm done.       &apos;                .     Such a result would appear  possible in at least three directions.     1.  It is, of course, one object, and the most important object, of the Statutory List. Among the grounds for  alarm quoted in the reports which  have  led to the preparation of this  memorandum there is  a statement that,  in British  colonies  and  elsewhere, German overseas connections have been destroyed  by the interruption of the trade of German overseas houses and through the replacement of these by new channels of trade which  are likely  to he permanent.  The Statutory List, and the  constructive  policy carried on in connection with it, seek to attain the same ends.;     So far as destruction, at least, is  concerned, our efforts have  already been almost entirely successful in China and the East, and we have long had  evidence  of German realisation of the harm  done/The trouble is, indeed, that so far as the  destructive work  is concerned,  it  is  done  in the  East, and  the prolongation of the war does not  add to it.  Even there, further  progressive damage might be done by the  better establishment  of new channels  of trade  through  the extension of the operations of British/Allied, or neutral houses.   This question of constructive work will.be dealt with a little later, but it should be pointed out that the German opinion already quoted, rightly emphasises the  paramount importance of this aspect.  What is fatal is not the interruption, but the interruption and replacement, of a firrns activities.     In  the other great market  of South America  our success has  been less in view of the  much greater extent to which the  United States presented an alternative  source of supply.  In Central  America, for  the same  reason, it  has been possible  to do very little.  Given the co-operation of the United States, which appears possible but which is still in doubt, very much could certainly be achieved; and we have  evidence of the importance Germany now attaches to keeping her hold on these markets.     As has been said, the  replacement  of interrupted channels of trade is all important. We shall have to be content, in view of British conditions,  to see a large part of this replacement clone by American  and local houses.   Whatever our regrets, the main end will be furthered, and their gain would be primarily at  German expense rather than at our  own.   Much more might, however, be  done by our own people,  given official recognition of the direct. belligerent importance  of such  work.  The release, when absolutely necessary, from ^military  service  of what would constitute a  very limited number of men, who were trained travellers and foreign  agents, and the  more liberal extension of financial assistance, even if only  by permission  for  public issues,  would make an altogether  disproportionate difference.                      V v : V     Such a policy vigorously pursued and skilfully advertised would be likely to have an increased effect even without United States co-operation.   Given this co-operation, and its definite avowal,  as a deliberate policy, the  effect would quite certainly be very considerable.   The avowal by the United States of trade war, as a part of hostilities, would go further to achieve the end in view than any other single measure.                                  * See note, p. 10.                                .
      2. The second general method, for.securing the necessary result lies in a somewhat different: direction.  It would  be.  a.  very substantial  factor if such  schemes as the. British Trade Corporation and  a British  Metal  Bank could be brought into  effective operation.-  Quite  apart  from the full. development  of suclr schemes in due course, present opportunities exist (in view of the possibilities of the Statutory List and in view of general war conditions) for capturing trade or sources of supply.  German commercial circles would have real ground for alarm if they found that concerns which were likely to be most serious  competitors were, already in operation and in a position to make the most of those advantages which are bound to exist during the continuance of the war.      3. The third possibility of action  is  of a more drastic character.  Any such concerns as have just been mentioned must be governed in their operation by the consideration of profits.   It appears well worth considering whether, as a definite part of hostilities, a board of financial  and commercial experts ought not to be created, and supplied with funds on  a  considerable  scale, to be used primarily from the point of view of damaging German prospects.  The  extent of  Allied  control and our greater  freedom of com- munication leaves relatively little room for retaliation, and far better means of counter- acting any such attempt.     It is  obviously  out of the question for anyone but an expert to attempt to discuss possibilities  along  such a line  of action.   It is hard, however, to resist the conclusion that the  right men might steadily  do damage of great  importance at a total cost amounting to less  than that of a weeks war.  Certain possibilities are obvious even in. the  light  of the existing experience.   Cases arise where competition might be started which would certainly imply danger and loss to German interests, but where the ultimate outcome  is too uncertain, and financial difficulties  too great, to make action possible on any other basis.   The buying up of supplies, or sources, of raw material would touch a question as to which German opinion is, as has been stated, already concerned. For  example, the purchase  of the output of  monazite sand from Brazil for the next four  to five  years  would give us complete hold upon the production of thorium nitrate, and  a most  powerful lever  to attack the gas mantle industry and transfer it to this country.   The only other source of this sand is in British India and thus under control.     One point, however, deserves emphasis.   The  Germans are already attempting to sow  distrust of ourselves among our Allies, in respect of trade war;  and to detach these, at least in  respect of after the war. measures.  It is vitally important that, in any present measures, we should be equally considerate of the interests of our Allies and of our own people.  For  that  reason, as well as on other grounds, it would be most desirable, that any  measures  should be  taken jointly  and  in very close co-operation.  For much the same reason it is important that in working through, and benefiting, firms or companies, as little distinction as possible should be made between our own firms and those of our Allies.  Such distinction, as will be inevitable, should  be clearly based on using those best suited to damage German  interest.   This policy  may mean  some loss of British advantage  but, if in truth no British interest is so vital as a satisfactory peace, the price will  be well  paid.  In  this  connection  loyalty to France and America is,  for different reasons, equally important.     Becent discussions between the Foreign Trade Department and M. Kammerer, the head of the  Black  Listing Department at  the French  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have made clear that we  can  rely absolutely on French support for co-operation in  a policy of vigorous^ trade war.  Further, while the French Government will, of course, expect a loyal attitude to French interests,  they fully appreciate  the necessity in which we are placed  of having regard so far as is  possible to our export trade, alike in our own and  allied  interests. : The position in respect of the  United  States of America is, of course, a different matter.  Their  full  co-operation is  essential if much more  is to be done by the Statutory List.   It  is scarcely less essential if any wrecking scheme is to be adopted/unless  we are prepared to accept very serious risks of friction and bad feeling.  Their  avowal  of a policy of  vigorous  trade  war, as  an integral  part of hostilities,  would, as has been said, go far by itself to produce the desired eliect. .   American co-operation is. not yet  secured;  legislation is, however, in course whichgives most of the powers which are  essential for co-operation in  our Statutory Listpolicy.  The problem is  to convince the administration  of the desirability of a vigoroususe of those powers, and as to the  general necessity for a vigorous trade war as part0^fl1(utl^tieS&apos;  ^ Present there is a tendency to suspect that  our policy is directed toselfish ends, and there  appears  also to  be a feeling that the interests of  the  UnitedStates require the rapid commercial recuperation of Germany after the war. f. t    -v ^r&amp;uments which may be used for a vigorous trade war, as an integral partof hostdities, are, as has been indicated, of very great strength.  Given any need for
 German fear as to commercial recuperation, still  more given  the existence of. such a fearj a powerful means of pressure exists in the infliction of economic  damage carried out by measures which are bound up with hostilities and which are progressive in their effect.   The possession of  such a  weapon- depends  directly on sea  power  and . on commercial power.   If it is not employed the Allies&apos; sea power is not fully used.  If it is not employed, great  commercial nations not only elect  to  fight with an arm tied behind their back, but  exclude from the forces which count  in war, one which alone does not  involve  special military preparation.   It may  be  added that if to any substantial extent the ends of war can be furthered  by attacking  property rather than life  there is the strongest ethical  argument  for defending or advocating the necessary measures.   The  only problem  is whether in fact a substantial  effect  can be produced. All  our evidence points both to the possibility of  producing such an effect and to the present sensitiveness of German opinion in this direction.     Such  and similar arguments have been  pressed on the United States Government in regard  to co-operation in our Statutory List  policy.  The  State Department are, however, very naturally disinclined  to  move from  their past dislike of  that policy, the less so since they still show signs of regarding the matter from a somewhat narrow legal standpoint.  The best hope of securing co-operation in this and other  directions in such a policy  as has been indicated, would appear now to lie in pressing the matter with the States in  the highest possible quarters, as a broad and  most important question of policy, and as an immediate and real contribution to our common aims which it is within their immediate power to make.  We are in a position to meet  special objections and to press special considerations.   On the one hand, our experience shows that, given care, their export trade should not  suffer any substantial loss, and should gain eventually. On the other hand, German  penetration in  South  America  is of such a character that the  States cannot  be blind to its  political effect, or indifferent to the gain from  its progressive elimination.     So far the discussion has been confined  to trade war during  hostilities, and as an integral  part of hostilities.   Such a policy is obviously open to far fewer objections than is the prospect  of trade war after hostilities have ceased.  But, as-  has  been said, although other grounds for alarm could well  be enforced, it is on post  bellum opposition that German alarm has at present concentrated.     Nor is this surprising.   If Germany is unable to  secure  &quot;most-favoured-nation&quot; treatment, this would be sufficiently serious for  German  prospects were it confined to the  British  Empire.   It would represent an  almost impossible  obstacle  to  German recovery were Germany  faced  by a  combination  of Great Britain, the  United States, France, and  the various  lesser Powers which would probably be drawn  inevitably into such a group.  As a result, in  the  degree in which trade  war after hostilities is a real possibility  when peace negotiations are begun, in that degree the Allies possess a most important counter for the purposes of negotiation.     This memorandum is concerned with trade war as a means of pressure on Germany with a view to hastening an acceptable  peace.  The possibility of trade war after the war  affects, in the  first instance, the course of peace negotiations, when once begun, rather than  the  point at which  they can be begun with  any prospect  of securing an acceptable  peace.  On the other hand, these two  things are obviousl)&apos;  not independent. The  Allies are pledged  to  secure certain acts of restitution  and  reparation.  This country at  least  could hardly view with equanimit)&apos; the return  to  Germany of her colonial possessions.  The point at which Germany might be prepared to make necessary concessions  is most substantially affected in the measure in which she may have to barter territoiial  or other concessions to avoid a subsequent trade war.     What has been said depends of course on  the assumption that, given a reasonably adequate peace,  &quot; most favoured-nation&quot; treatment could be  substantially conceded. Apart from  the  need for safeguarding  certain  essential industries and supplies ofmaterial--a need which in itself would be best  met by requiring British control ratherthan by excluding our.pres3nt enemies there is, however, a very strong case for being prepared to abandon trade war when peace is signed.     There  are, in the  first instance, such general  considerations as. the very doubtfulcharacter of  the effect  on  our own prosperity, and the danger of  forcing German commercial interests to coalesce with the military caste in  desiring a further  war toset right the balance.   There are also further considerations of immediate importance.     Territorial concessions may be vitally important for our purposes, not merely forthe value or necessity of this or that particular concession,  but in regard to their moralconsequences.  We have set ourselves to achieve the destruction of German militarism.In order  to achieve  it we  have, in all  probability,  to force German opinion to admit
 that its past militarist policy has in fact failed.  We have to secure, in short, a peace which the German Government cannot explain to its people  save by an admission that its policy was a false one; and it has to be remembered that the popular standard of failure or success will  be the existence or absence  of territorial  concessions.  It can hardly be maintained that, apart from  the war, there was any danger of an economic attack on Germany.   In consequence, success in again securing pre-war conditions  in respect of commerce will have far less value for  the military caste  than success  in maintaining territorial boundaries.  The sheer necessity of commercial recovery may drive the German Government to make territorial concessions, but any such step constitutes an obvious admission of the failure of militarist policy.     As a result there is much to be said  for bartering &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; treat- ment for territory.  Further, if we do the maximum damage to German trade during hostilities,  and as. part of  hostilities,  but as little harm as possible  by post-war legislation we not only avoid the danger, already indicated, of driving the commercial opinion to look to a future war, but we  supply an added inducement for such opinion to set itself against a militarist policy.   It  has to  be remembered that human nature being what it is, and although the general  damage  done to trade by war is enormous, special weight is given to such damage as is incident on one&apos;s own  side but not  on the other.  If hostilities are liable to  include an effective trade war, we reduce the danger that commercial interests may  again favour war  as a means to expansion;  on  the other hand, trade war during peace must serve to encourage the recurrence of war.     Finally, if we are  to possess, from  the real  possibility of a subsequent trade war, the maximum of bargaining  power,  it is  of  the  greatest  importance to secure  the consent of the United States to such a possibility.    We  have every reason to be aware of the alarm and distaste at  present felt in the United States and by the United States Government at such  a  contingency, and we can only hope to secure United States co-operation in this  connection  if  it is made clear that such a trade war  is  only contemplated, as a necessary evil, in the event of inadequate peace terms which would leave Germany certain  to remain aggressive, and which would therefore leave it  all important to  check  her economic  recovery; and,  further,  that it  would be  freely bargained away to secure terms which were calculated to discredit the present military party or to limit at least, and more  directly, the opportunities  at their disposal.  We have.to make clear, first, that a trade war after hostilities  is only intended in certain contingencies ;  but, secondly, that these contingencies will be more certainly and morerapidly avoided if Germany  has  to allow for  the  possibility of such opposition.  The-&apos; weapon has to be forged in advance, if we wish to see the least question  arise of the desirability of using it. -..&quot;,--&apos;.&apos; What  has been said appears  to   point  to the desirability of  developing andmodifying the policy embodied in the resolutions of the Paris  Conference.  We haveto secure, if possible, that a post helium trade war  becomes  an  even greater danger to Germany in view of the adhesion of the United -Vaites.  On the other  hand, it has to become clearer that this danger is contingent.  Tb.3- better this is understood in Germany, the easier is our problem.  There is already evidence that the  Chancellor is endeavouringto educate opinion to the fact that &quot; conquests &quot; may have  to be sacrificed to  avoid a trade war, and we stand to gain by letting it be known that at a price such a war is avoidable. .   It is probable that  some time will have to elapse before opinion has  been sufficiently educated in different directions, in the United States on  the  one hand, and  in  France and  Great Britain on the other, to make possible the enunciation by agreement of anv such policy.   If this becomes possible  nothing would so well  serve  the purpose ofaffecting German opinion as a further conference.  In the meantime,  and as a step  inthe necessary education, there is the simpler but  no less important task of securingagreement to a vigorous trade war as part of hostilities.       .
APPENDIX I.GERMAN OPINION OF  TRADE WAR.                          (A.) Tariff War after the War. -     THE &quot; Leipziger Volkszeitung &quot;of the  1st May; admits that if a British Imperial Tariff Union were to be arranged, matters would be very serious for Germany.   . . The &quot; Bheinisch Westphalische Zeitung &quot;of the 10th May says :-          &quot;Unless we succeed in.extorting from England  absolutely  unrestricted  rnost-     favoured-nation treatment for Gorman goods in Motherland as well as in Dominions     and colonies, we shall see our hands forcibly tied in other  directions by those who -    take their political commercial  cue from  her,  so  that  our foreign  trade will    - inevitably lag behind that of those Powers who  are  even now  preparing, by     drawing closer the bonds that unite them, to conquer us in the coming trade war.     Germany  now  realises that if England succeeds  in  establishing  an  Imperial     Customs Union against her, the  situation will be a very serious one for the future     of German trade, for such a combination must of a  necessity draw into its orbit a :    number of smaller States, and thus an  enormous weight will be set in motion in     the interests of the British Empire.&quot;                                       . .-.; ;  ..; Sir Walter Townley writes: Other German papers connected  with trade interests have published articles which  show that  Germany is becoming more and more appre- hensive of effects on her after-war trade of a British Tariff Union  which she foresees will become, by inclusion of America, an Anglo-Saxon  combine against herself.   She has already started a  press  campaign designed to  open  the eyes of England&apos;s present continental Allies to the fact that  her interests differing so essentially from theirs, it is inevitable that she will chuck them  as soon  as  it  suits her political convenience to do so,                                                                    -     The  &quot; Kreuz Zeitung:&quot; of the  29th May, in  its  leading article on  after-war problems, says:- :V\o:;-          &quot; More and more it  becomes evident that being unable to beat Germany by     force of arms, England will endeavour subsequently to  destroy her by trade war.     That the markets of the world should be reopened to us is an absolute necessity of     our. economic existence,  and  t^&apos;exclusion  of  German trade  or its differential   &quot;treatment must be made  impossible.&quot;     The &quot; Hamburger Naehrichten &quot; points to the economic importance of Brazil :-          &quot; Her entrance into the war from a military point of view is of no interest one   .  way  or the other.  The length of the war will not be affected by her  entry into it.     But from  another point of view the  fact of her taking  a hand is not  without     significance.  For whether it is a  question  of  Guatemala, Liberia., Honduras, or     Brazil, each case accentuates that  commercial  isolation into which Germany; is    / being gradually pushed and  which it is the principal object  of her enemies  to     achieve...  A direct reply  to this menace she does  not  command.   Her  only real     hope is in ultimate victory.  Only if Germany wins will she be in a position at the     close of the war to pick up  again her oversea commercial connections and resume    ; her oversea trade.&quot;     The  writer of an  article in  the &quot; Illustrirte Zeitung &quot;of  the  1st May,  on  &quot;The Outlook for the Future of Our World Trade,&quot; says :-          &quot; Great  anxiety is felt as to the resumption of  trade  relationships with our     present enemies.  It is. known that from the 14th to the 16th  July,  1916, our     enemies met in Paris to consult as to the best means of carrying on the trade, war     against Germany after the  conclusion of peace.   They wish to  prevent us getting     any raw materials, to deny us the  position  of the &apos; most-favoured-nation,5 to shut     up German merchants in their own  countries, but  to  enter themselves  into
     reciprocal trading connections to a large extent .  ....  We must  not forget     that their enmity against us will not L suddenly come  to  an end because peace is     declared,  and that this enmity can  show,  itself  by doing its best under all     circumstances to cramp our trade.&quot;.     The &quot;Lokal-Anzeiger&quot; of the 8th May makes one of the first public calls to the people to remember that Germany will meet with great  difficulties  in her future efforts to persuade Anglo-Saxon  and Allied countries to  restore to her  the trade facilities she enjoyed before the war.     The &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; argues that the terms of the future peace  must be so framed that no ill-feeling will remain  between the  Central European Powers,  Russia, and Japan, because these nations will  have to stand together  in  the trade war  of the future, in  opposition to Great Britain and her confederates.  The weakened world- trade of Great Britain will be unable to stand alone against the rivalry of an unrestricted German commerce.   Fox this reason, England realises that  German commerce must be lamed.  It is this laming that Germany has  got to prevent, and  in order to do this she must secure a complete understanding and union of interests  between  the German States and  the two Eastern Powers, Russia and Japan.                           .    . The &quot; Tagliche Rundschau&quot; of the 23rd May says:-         &quot;We shall have to consider what points of trade  agreement we can arrive at     with our present enemies.  In the matter of most-favoured-nation  agreement, for     instance,  we shall  have to  admit the  claims  of some of them.   The more  one     considers  this question of the resumption  of our home and  foreign trade after the   &apos;  war, the more one realises  that apparently  insoluable problems  will have to be     solved in order to restore pre-war  prosperity to German  trade.    But in that     direction we  need not worry over.the efforts of our enemies under John  BulFs     leadership to exclude us after the war from the world&apos;s trade.  Such threats carry     no fear to the hearts of German  industrials  and wholesale traders,  for they know     well that  the results in  the world markets  are not affected by  tall talk, but by     the suitability and cheapness of articles produced.  Therefore  the future will  remain     ours as was the past.&quot;                (B.) The Destruction of Overseas Trade Connections.     A representative of the &quot;Frankfurter  Zeitung&quot; said,  in  an interview at TheHague last month, that-        &quot; German trade threads with  such important commercial centres as Singapore,     Hong Kong, Sidney,  and  Yokohama have  not  only  been  broken  but smashed     beyond repair, because the place of the defunct German has  already been occupied     by keen trade rivals, who will  not again yield the position won without a mighty     struggle.   What has occurred at the  places  mentioned  is likely  to be carried     further north now that China has also entered  the war on the side  of Germany&apos;s     commercial competitors.&quot;     The^&quot; Lokal-Anzeiger&quot; of  the  8th May, commenting on  the  breaking  off ofdiplomatic relations with Brazil, &amp;c, says :         &quot;One hopes  that  few more such  events are in store, for otherwise even     favourable peace terms would be powerless to effect restoration of German  World     Trade now being destroyed. . In fact, as it is,  its reconstruction will offer almost     insuperable difficulties, even to the ablest of German merchants.  Passive  resistance     which  German  commerce  will meet from  present  enemies  abroad implies  an     obstacle  which  can  hardly be overestimated  when  considering restoration  of     status quo ante of German oversea trade.&quot;    The &quot; Kreuz-Zeitung &quot; of the 29th May says, in its leading article-        &quot;For our political economy it  is essential that access to the world&apos;s markets   ;  shall be re-established.&quot; , . -The  writer of an article in the  &quot; Illustrirte Zeitung&quot; of the 1st  May on TheOutlook for the future of our World Trade, says :- -   &apos;    &quot; Our whole-trade has suffered heavily and will hardly recover for years. .  . .     lne English..... have managed to carry out what they were wishing for, namely,
  .. : to retain the magnificent, trade possibilities  of the &quot;British possessions entirely for 1    British subjects, and to shut in our faces t^                          open:  ...     The longer the war lasts the more serious will be the harm which the circumstances- *  .  will  do us  even after the war  is over.  .  ...  Why are we experiencing such  &quot;difficulty in crushing our opponents, and that in spite of  brilliant leadership  and     unsurpassed exertions ?  Because  all the means of help derived from a world-wide     trade are open to them, while to us, owing to the English Blockade, these means .    of help are more or less closed to us.&quot;        -             (C.) Withholding from Germany of necessary raw materials.     The  &quot; Bayerische Staatszeitung&quot;. publishes  from a &quot; special source&quot; the termswhich.Germany will require for the conclusion of peace.   These terms are-         &quot;1. Germany will not exact indemnity because her war loans are. not excessive     in relation to her national property.         &quot;2. Germany will make agreement with her enemies for delivery either free or  .   at a very low price of raw materials.       .  &quot; 3. Germany will demand that  trade  be renewed with her, and that she be     permitted  to develop at full power in regions open to her before the war.         &quot; 4. German ships and colonies will have to  be restored.&quot; &apos;    Several leaders in the chief papers of  the 23rd May are concerned with after-wartrade questions which are beginning to worry Germany  seriously as she realises moreand more that we can starve her economically as  well as physically by preventing herobtaining  raw materials at all, or only at such a price as shall be prohibitive. ycu  Some writers argue that  Germany must demand a  war indemnity in the shape ofraw  materials,   with  advantageous commercial  conditions for  German trade.  Theimportance of these raw materials is represented as being of the utmost  importance toGerman trade and as being far more necessary than actual money.     The &quot; Kreuz-Zeitung &quot; of the 29th May says in its leading article    .         &quot; Already England and her Allies have obtained control of the greater part of     those raw materials which, are essential to our home and foreign production, and this     constitutes a certain danger  to us.   Without admitting the possibility of success of     England&apos;s scheme to cut us  off entirely from supplies of foreign raw  materials, we     must secure.our  commercial  independence by obtaining  complete possession and     control of such  countries as may supply our needs in  that direction.&quot;     The writer of an article in the &quot;Illustrirte Zeitung&quot;  of the 1st May says :          &quot; We  need world-trade in ordor to provide ourselves  with cotton, wool, food-     stuffs, luxuries, copper,  and many other important  raw  materials; we need the     worlds markets for the sale of our industrial products-yes, we must in the future     dump relatively more industrial products in  the world&apos;s markets in order  to bring   /our trade  relationships as quickly&apos; as possible into the condition they occupied     before the war.&quot;            .          &apos;  -&apos;.&apos;-     The &quot;Deutsche Tageszeitung &quot; of the  23rd May says  :         &quot;The  importance of this  question  of raw materials  is only just beginning     to  come home  to Germans,  but   any   sort  of  unanimity in  the  political     view  of this all-important  subject  is  far from  from  prevailing.    We  consider     it would be madness to go on in the apparently general belief that immediately     after  the war  all  industries-nay,  almost  any firm  which so  choses-will  be     able at   once to  take  up the thread  of  activity  just  where it  was dropped     when war  broke out.   We fear  that in this matter  Germany  will be  entirely     in the hands of the enemy, for  she  will be unable  to command the necessary     raw materials which she will need to  get quickly  and in  enormous quantities.     And.  whatever  she  did receive she  would have to pay  for through the nose.     It is for  this reason that the action of her enemies assumes so much importance,.     who are endeavouring to force oversea neutrals to  break with her, thinking     thus  to  starve  industrial Germany  by depriving   her of raw  materials  even     whilst discussing terms&apos; of peace  with her  at the  conference .table.   This is  a
        important  matter (&apos; ein sehr beachtenswerter PunktJ&apos;).  Germany&apos;s enemies   are prepared to follow their direct by aii indirect starvation war.   This intention   to isolate Germany industrially is evident iiot only in the Paris Conferences, but in-the gradual attraction of neutral countries into the war, and in the fusion of their   interests with those of her  enemies/Germans are faced with a deliberate plan to   destroy the Empire by means of slow industrial starvation.-  Great Britain and the   United States of America are the leading powers in this conspiracy.   The question   Of the supply of Germany with raw materials remains a question of her capacity to   ensure the  delivery of those raw  materials.   Therefore only a really victorious   conclusion to  the war can solve it satisfactorily a victory which would enable   Germany to  enforce that delivery as a necessary condition of and before we   consented even to the opening of a Peace Conference.&quot;;APPENDIX II.                  HAMBURG,  FRANKFURT, AND THE TRADE WAR.    THE United States consul-general in London, who has a  long  experience  ofGerman commerce, says that the heart and brains of German commercial expansion arecentered in Hamburg ; German manufacturers are worse merchants of their goods thanour own.   Consequently  the  attitude of  Hamburg  towards  a trade  war duringhostilities and a post helium policy is of importance.    For a long time it has been apparent that  there is a marked cleavage of opinion inGermany upon commercial policy, both in  regard to  distant  as well  as immediateobjectives.  These differences  came  to a head upon the  publication of Naumann&apos;s&quot; Mittel-Europa.&quot;  Its doctrine is by now familiar.  Briefly it was the construction ofan allied block across Central Europe, cemented commercially by a Zollverein.  It waspolitically attractive, and the attraction was increased  by the  conquest of Roumania,which seemed to make its realisation possible, until the British victories in Mesopotamiaestablished a perpetual  menace  on  the  flank  and  rather  discounted its value.Economically Naumann claimed that  the  block would be  self-supporting,  drawingmetals, hides, cotton, wool, and oil-bearing seeds from Serbia and the rich hinterland ofAsia  Minor,  which is  capable of immense development.   The  scheme  was loudlycanvassed, and  received the support of the big munition industries, who find in theBalkans an insatible market, and also of the Deutsche Bank, already  deeply committedto the Baghdad Railway and similar undertakings in the Near East.    Hamburg,  however,  took alarm  at once; the scheme appeared to  ignore thenecessity for a German mercantile marine and for oversea trade connections, and  whileit may  have offered to German manufacturers new sources of raw material, by thenature of its geography it excluded  the oversea merchants. from  participation in theprofits.  The Economic  Unions of Hamburg  and Bremen  accordingly petitioned theChancellor not to forget them, and their interests, reminding him of the debt owed byGermany to her mercantile community  and demanding the inevitable  outlet to  the seaas vital to German intersts.  They enlisted the support of the &quot; Colonial Expansionists &quot;and in the inevitable argument both views dissolved into the usual newspaper sputter.Little definite remained except the one fact that the great industrialists and the  greatmerchant houses obviously sought their own  interests, which might prove conflicting..  . The next sign of cleavage appeared upon  the appointment of a  GovernmentCommittee for the Reconstruction of Industry after the War, when the methods  to beadopted during  the  transition from war to peace conditions - were  discussed.   Thediscussion turned round  the two  cardinal  points of labour and raw  materials.   Withthe former  we  are not  concerned,  but the  attitude  of  Hamburg to  the  latter issignificant. .  The obvious problem was to supply raw materials for practically the wholeof German industry, and as cheaply as  possible, owing to the depreciation of the mark.The &quot;Grosse Industrie &quot;naturally demanded the maintenance of the system of  Statepurchase under a central authority as the only  safeguard against a ruinous exploitation.Hamburg sharply criticised the scheme.  Throughout  the war the great industriesactively engaged in munition work had  suffered comparatively little, while the Hamburgmerchants had little else to do than contemplate their silent wharves  and rotting ships.- *.&apos;...

They had kept alive their houses oversea, but all- the  time it had  meant a drain upontheir resources  as the  returns  were slight.   Even the help of the Banco AlemanTransatlantic and the National City Bank of New York  had&apos; not been able  to relievethis  strain to any great extent.  We have ample. evidence of the difficulties manyHamburg houses  experienced  in  keeping  together  their  oversea  establishments.Moreover, there  is no doubt that they  invested very large sums of money in SouthAmerica in the purchase of raw materials.  With each attempt at peace these purchasesincreased.  We  have- evidence from the end of 1915 when the  captains of internedHamburg-American liners received instructions to put their ships in immediate readinessfor return to Germany. - The ships were fully laden,  e.g., in the Argentine  about6,000,000/. of wool was  said to be stored in them.  Tartly, no doubt, these investmentsin realisable  raw materials were due to fears of the confiscation of capital, but partly,Hamburg hoped to make profits out of the German industrialist in compensation for theinequality of their positions during  the war and they resented  the  assumption ofpurchasing powers by the State solely in the interests of manufacturers.     These two  instances  reveal  the  sensitiveness  of  Hamburg  to  any belligerentcommercial policy.  Hamburg, and, to a less extent, Bremen, have a strong  infusion ofthe Jewish element, and regard  the world-through the eyes of cosmopolitan commerce.Nowhere has Anglophobia been more  bitter &apos;i when they thought of their  mercantilemarine, yet nowhere else in Germany has a  desire for a reconciliation with Englandbeen exposed so  directly, even by public bodies, such as the Chamber of Commerce.3 -  -  We can  only  hit  at  German manufacturers through military victory  and  theblockade, but an extension of our belligerent commercial policy with the support of theUnited States of America can threaten Hamburg with virtual &quot;extinction.   Already  herposition  as the entrepot centre for Scandinavia is shaken by Copenhagen ; Havre  aridAntwerp may still regain their position, and hi London, too, she sees this danger.   Shedepends  upon her oversea-connections;&quot; prevent  them (rein  obtaining supplies withwhich to retain their clientele; by wrecking methods create difficulties in the purchaseof raw- material to be stored, for Hamburg, and as they see their ships requisitioned by-each Power that enters the war,  and watch the eddies of  the trade war widening eachmonth, Hamburg merchants may well feel that the continuance of the war is intolerable.The one thing that united them to the manufacturers was  the common  danger of  a&quot; protective tariff &quot;after the war.  Substitute for that a threat of an implacable tradewar during, hostilities, with the hope of a return to the commercial comity of nations  ifthey learn reason, and it may well be that the whole mercantile and shipping communitywould  put a pressure  upon their Government which  the Chancellor,  even  thoughsupported by the great industrialists, already in difficulties about  raw material, wouldfind it difficult to resist.                                 ^:   &apos;\:   : &apos;;&apos;\             -     Frarilifurt&apos;s position is a little different.

Indeed, they must be repaired, for finance cannot exist if hemmedin by national or artificial boundaries.   Hence, Frankfurt was resigned to the  waruntil the entry of. the United  States.  The  leading  articles in the &quot; FrankfurterZeitung &quot;in the period between the rupture  of diplomatic relations and the declarationof war, cautious  though  they were, are evidence of the real dismay  in financial circlesat the turn of events.   We cannot hit at Frankfurt directly, but the United States ofAmerica can do incalculable damage, if only by taking in hand the German grip of themetal trade, which feeds upon the Metallgesellschaft and  the Metallbank at  Frankfurt.One.act  of this  magnitude  on the part of the United States of America, properly-advertised as an index of the future, and Frankfurfs alarm would be a serious politicalfactor.  It is difficult  to believe that the German Government, the  Austrian Govern-ment as well, with the Mark tumbling lower every day, and dependent so  much uponFrankfurt for financial support, could long remain deaf to representations that a peaceupon any  terms of  territorial  concession  is the  only hope  of  saving  Germanyeconomically, especially  if these representations were  supported by the argument thatsuch a peace was the only key to the markets of  the  Allies/without which Germantrade can scarcely hope  to exist.                                           &apos;   &apos;-            ;..&quot;.\vV,:;.;,  -  ...

Extract from the&quot; Daily Graphie&quot; July 2, 1917.    /The &quot;Munchner  Post&quot;  draws  the attention of its readers to  an article by-Professor Eulenburg, in which he expresses anything but optimistic views on the resultsof Americans intervention.              i      f.

In this way the South AmericanStates could  be forced to give  up all trade connection  with Germany, making  theoutlook very black indeed.     The professor does not disdain, either, the moral significance  of having America asan enemy.  &quot; Politically,  the  hostility of a great Power like the  United States is  notwithout significance for our position in the world,&quot; he writes.  &quot;  We lose at the sametime the sympathies of many circles.  Opinions and sympathies should not be indifferentto us, for  nothing is  done with powrer alone; ideologic moments  play everywhere agreat part.   We are looked upon, at present, as a nation ruled by an absolute Govern-ment, and from whom free  nations run away, so as to have nothing  to  do with  us.Antipathies are growing with the Poles, Czechs, South-Slavs.   The battle-cry of Wilsonagainst absolutism and autocracy, so cleverly used, is increasing  the many difficultieswith the frontier nations,  particularly in the  Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.&quot;    The article is based on a &quot; Central News &quot; telegram from  Berne, and steps  arebeing taken to obtain the original article in the &quot; Munchner Post.&quot;o
