                           WAR CABINET. - &quot;           ^  /  RE&amp;TJLATION OF THE PR ICS OP BliMD..                Memorandum by the Food Controller.     I have had under considerate on the steps to be takento regulate and reduce the price of bread.  Much of theMachinery for this, purpose already exists, as the suppliesof all importec, cereals have bsen taken over by the Governmentand the principal Flour Mills are controlled.   The immediatefurther steps now necessary are:-     (1)  to control the home crops of wheat and barley;-------v: (2)  to fix on a price at which bread should be sold.        &quot;having re gar il. to the result lag/ cost to the Exchequer *          the possible effects upon consumption, and other matters.     Control of. Home Crops   L scheme for this purpose is beingprepared,  L am not yet in a position to make detailed pro-posals, but I see no. reason to doubt the practicability qfintroducing a scheme sufficiently comprehensive for . the presentpurpose of regulating the price of bread,     The price of Bread - I submit for the considerationof the 7/ar Cabinet the following proposals:     (a) that the general price  of bread per quartern loaf         he fixed at &apos;9d. and that flour be issued from the flour         mills to bakers at a rate corresponding to this:     (h) that the resulting loss on imported wheat be borne by         the Exchequer.   -  (a) that the flour mills should purchase British wheat at         a price corresponding to the price of 9d. for the         quartern leaf,  This will be practically the minimum         price guaranteed under  the Corn Production Bill, viz:         60/- per-quarter. .     Quartern Loaf at  9d;, The. present price of bread in theUnited kingdom is on an average ll^d. per  quartern.  The aotualprices in particular districts vary from 10d. or less to l/Ed.or more.  I have had. reasons laid before me against any drasticreduction of these prices:
     (1) Any reduction will probably tend to  increase con-        sumption a&amp;d waste.   The  tendency to waste will        be  accentuated  if the bread while being  made cheaper.        is  kept at  its  present  rather  low quality.     (E) Any reduction at the  expense of the  State, however  x.    small, will bo  adversely  criticised  on principle by       : financial puriste&quot; in  this country,- and may possibly        unfavourably Influence&apos; opinion in America and Canada,    .  :  where  it would  be felu  that War loans raised there       .&apos; should not;bo used to subsidise the  civilian popu-       - lation there,  .     (3) The loss&apos; to the Exchequer is serious, vis:  12,000,000       /per annum cn imported-wheat alone for every  Id, off       &quot;the quartern.loaf.  On the &quot;btherv--haiid,v&apos;it^-iB^/^l)ci\/iirged^-/--.&apos;     (1) that any small  reduction  of price (say to 10d.) would        give so little  satisfaction or relief as to  be hardly        worth  making,           &apos;     (8) that in the light of  the&apos;  reports being received from        the Commissioners on  Industrial- unrest:and other       &apos; sources as  to the disturbing offsets.-upon public        feeling- of  the  present - high;-prices;  a really subs tan-        tial reduction&apos; in &quot;the/ price; Of the main article of       / food is justified and necessary,    : kZ) &quot;that it is  legitimate to  use - the money derived from        excess profits  in cheapening the-principal foodstuffs,       - rand that labour -representatives would probably prefer       &apos;- this course, to the alternative of further increases        of  wages which,besides being  on,the whole more        expensive to the State, cannot afford the- same        uniform relief  -to-all sections of wage - earners.     Oh the  whole I  recommend  the  proposed price of 9d* perquartern,  as securing substantial  results without involvingexcessive  risks or:any necessaryloss to -the  -Bxehequer on Britishwheat,    -J*Q3.s  ..t6 &apos;jgxchequor; on imported wheat: - $he price  at whichimported wheat  must  be supplied  to the  mills,: in-order to providefor a quartern^ loaf  at 9d, is  62/- per  quarter..0,1 ,f.  Having regardto the price at which imported wheat is -likely to-be  bought by theGovernment (83/- o.i,f.) it  is estimated that this may involve thoBxchoquer  in a  loss  of nearly-  30,000,000 per-annum,   I give, briefly,in an Appendix, the  calculations^ on which this estimato is founded,together with corresponding  estimates for a quartern  loafatSd,
and at 10d.     Price, of British, v/heat;   A price of 62/- c,i,f. for importedwheat corresponds fairly with a price cf 60/- for British wheat.It is proposed accordingly that this (which is the.minimum guaran-teed price under the Corn Production Bill)  should in fact he .paid hy the controlled mills to - the farmers.   -This will involveneither loss nor gain to the Exchequer on British wheat.   \      It may prove necessary to reebnsider this price for Britishwheat either -      (a)  With a view to maintaining parity with other articles     ;  :    produced by the farmer (since it is important that           no other article should pay for its production better           than wheat)  :  &quot;OR.          .-      (b)  with reference to the amount that  will.actually be           paid to the American and Canadian farmers under&apos;        .&quot;  Mr. Hoover * s  arrangements.&apos;       I hope that it may in fact be possible to avoid paying more for British wheat.  If not,  the extra payment can be made by authorising the mills to pay,  on behalf of the Government,  so many shillings per quarter above the price fairly corresponding to the 9d. quartern loaf.  This,would involve an - additional loss to the Exchequer.  &apos;                        . .     .  If the quartern loaf were fixed at 8d., it would undoubtedly be necessary, in view of the guarantee in the Corn Production Bill,  for the Government to incur a loss&apos; in respect &quot;of British wheat.                         ..&apos;.&apos;-&apos;.&apos;&apos;&apos;.&apos;   - V; -:V: :;\:^:y..    :   Bread Price Variable in Special Cases  ;  I should add that though I have spoken of fixing the price of  bread,  it would not - A be deiirable to make this from the outset an absolutely fixed price in every district.  The working costa  of Bakers differ greatly according to locality,  turnover,  and other circumstances.
I propose rather through the controlled mills to issue flourat a uniform price (44/9d. per sack);  to announce that thisis expected to yield a quartern loaf at 9d; and to requireany baker who wishes to sell at a different price tojustify this within a stated period ( say a month) to theMinistry of Food or local Pood Authority,  hy provingexceptional costs of. production.   The  retail priceef flourwould he fixed in all cases *                                          (Sgd.)  RHOKDDA.16th July, 1917.-- - : - --&apos;-:&apos;V;--:V-^^&apos;flHMllllllibBBMMtaE
                  TOTAFCTAX- FITECT OF PROPOSALS.      Provisional estimates of the cost to the Exchequer of pro-viding&apos; for bread at 8d.,  9d.,  and lQd., per quartern loaf res-pectively are given below.   Tbe principle of these calculations isto assume a certain price for the quartern loaf  (say 9d);  to workback from this to the corresponding price that the baker can payto the miller for flour (44/9  per sack) and the miller to theGovernment or to the farmer for wheat (63/- per  quarter), allowinga reasonable margin only for working costs end profit in each case;and to treat the difference between what the miller  can afford  topay for wheat and what must be paid by or on behalf  of the Govern-ment to the producers as the lose to be borne by the Exchequer.     For simplicity these calculations are all made  on a wheatbasis.  That is to say, all the other  cereals which  may in factbe used by way of admixture, are treated as reduced  to terms ofwheat, minor differences of price in  relation to flour producingcapacity being ignored.   Any error so arising  is  too small to  affectthe broad results.Total Consumption in United Kingdom.   The prospective consumptionof cereals in flour and bread for the year 1917-18 may be estimatedas equivalent to 55,000,000 quarters  of wheat - 28,000,000 importedand 7,000,000 home grown.   This is slightly in  excess of the  actualconsumption in 1915-16, but it would  not be wise to  take a loserfigure.Imported Whftfl.ti   The average price at which it  seems likely thatwe shall be able to import wheat during 1916-17  may  te put at 85/-per quarter (480  lbs) C.i.f,   The price which  the miller will beable to pay for wheat, to produce a quartern loaf  at 9d., allowing  afairly gin for working costs and profit to millers and bakers,  is63/- per quarter.   That is to say, in order,          to get downto 9d., the Exchequer must stand a loss of 21/- per quarter, or on
APPENDIX  (oont d)88fooo,000  quarters  of  imported she at a loss at the rate of 20.500,000 a  year.   The  corresponding figures of loss at 8d. forthe quartern loaf are 30/3/per quarter  or  42,500,000 altogether;at 10d.  are ll/9d. per  quarter or  16,500,000 altogether.     It  may he noted that  *heat at 83/- per quarter should; ona commercial basis,  yield  bread at lljd. the quartern.  Every Id.below this, on the 26,000,000 imported quarters represents a lossof  13,000,000 a year.   . The loss by selling the quartern  loaf at9d. (viz:  39,500,000)  is  therefore S-J times  13,000,000.British  Wheat. .  The effect on the Exchequer here depends  of courseentirely upon  the price to he paid for the hone crops.  If thisprice is determined  by  reference to the high price paid by theGovernment  for imported wheat, there will of course be a further lossto the Exchequer in  respect of 7,000,000 quarters of the home  crop,amounting in each case  to  a fourth of the figures cited above.The farmers would get the  full advantage of the high prices andcharges  paid in respect of foreign wheat.   If on the other hand,the British wheat price/is determined by reference to the  lowerprice paid to  the Government by the Mills for imported wheat, therewill he  no  further loss to the Exchequer?  the farmers would get onlythe commercial price for wheat corresponding to the price  fixed forbread.                                     - .     The actual course  to  be adopted must depend upon the pointat which the price of bres4 is fixed.   With the quartern  loaf at     the miller can  pay 63/- per quarter to the (Jove rare ntfor imported wheat.     It  will be sufficient if he pays acorresponding  price  to  the farmer for British wheat,  leavingthe Exchequer  free of further loss.   With -bhe quartern loaf at    the  miller could pay only 52/9d.  per quarter for importedwheat.    He could pay the  Britiah farmer only about 50/9d. aprice below the guaranteed minimum of the Corn Production /
