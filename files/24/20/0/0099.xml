STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.          I circulate,  for the information of my Colleagues, anote of a conversation  which I recently had with M.Bmile Hovelaque.23rd July, 1917.
 ;T ,CTIY CONFIDENTIAL .        A week ago I had a visit from Monsieur Hovelaque, one of the most distinguished Educationalists in France, who was kJ. d enough at my suggestion to offer some evidence before the Committee on the Teaching of Modern Languages.   M.Hovelaque had a long conversation with me upon the present condition of France.   He is very seriously concerned as to the ravages of the War and as to the temper of the Army and the People.   The Nation, he says,  is waking up to a consciousness of the great losses which it has sustained,  and indeed it was M.Hovelaque&apos;s opinion that the loss in killed alone, which he estimated at 1,200.000, would constitute a permanent and irretrievable source of weakness to the Country,  especially since the agricultural population had been the principal sufferer in the war.    Already,  M.Hovelaque thought, there were ugly signs of a bitter feeling against the Allies and a ^ui^icion in the public  mind that France at the end of the war would be left without any concessions of territory,  whereas her Allies, who had suffered far less and who had reaped the profit of the French sacrifice,  would be  enriched by Colonies and other Possessions.        I asked M.Hovelaque whether France was still resolved to obtain Alsace-Lorraine and whether-public  opinion would be con- tented with French Lorraine only..   He regarded that solution as inadmissible in principle and urged that England should take  a strong stand on the Alsace-Lorraine question.        &amp;.Lovelaque had  recently returned  from a Mission toAmerica and was going  to advise  his Government that  no  largemeasure of confidence  could be placed in the  efficiency of the                                                       American
* American War organisation or in the consistent military purpose  of the Country.   The war, in his view, had &quot;been forced upon the Republic by a email minority, and it was only too likely that on the first reverse to American arms the great passive majority would re-assert its opinion.   In other words, M.Hbvelaque was not prepared to find any great source of comfort to Prance in the prospect of the American alliance, and the upshot of the conversation was to impress upon my mind the desirability of giving a prominent place to the French war sacrifices and to the legitimate peace claims of Prance in any public pronouncements to be made by our Ministers upon Foreign Policy during the course of this Summer.         M.Hovelaque thought that the French Army and people would welcome a renewed recognition of the fact that we were, as a Nation,  conscious of the great losses sustained by France and that a public affirmation of our intention to secure to France the best terms possible in the peace negotiations would have a good effect .         M.Hovelaque alluded to the discontent in the French Army. Active mutiny had,  for the time being,  been suppressed through the energetic measures of ILPainleve,  but if the Summer were hot and trying the position might again become serious.                                            14th July 1917.
