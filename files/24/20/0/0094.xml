N^FT^PROPOSEDJONFEh^NCE WITHVU.S.A. AND FRANCE ON THE Q        ONSSRVATJON OF THE MATERIAL RESOURCES OF THE ALLIES   -                PORING THE REOONSTKtJCTION PERIOD.              4 J g w         The entry of the United States of America into the Warmust seriously affect the position in regard to the suppliesof foodstuffs and raw materials after the War, and appears tonecessitate further consideration of the necessity andpracticability of the adoption by the Allies, including theUnited States, of a common policy to conserve their natural.resources for their own use during the Reconstruction Period.         There are a number of foodstuffs and raw materials ofgreat importance)in respect of which it is to be anticipatedthat there will tie i world shortage and very keen competitionfor supplies immediately after the Wat, owing to the fallingoff in agricultural production, the almost complete depletionof stocks of materials in enemy countries, and the transportdifficulties in the way of securing the necessary stocks in     jAllied and Neutral countries/ the need for making goodA thedestruction wrought in the occupied areas of Allied Countriesand in the Allied mercantile Marine,the increasing demands incountries like the United States and Japan by industriesdeveloped during the War, and the demand of industries anxiousto recover as rapidly as possible the ground lost both in homeand foreign markets owing to the circumstances of the War.         It will be recalled that this problem formed the subjectof one of the Resolutions of the Economic Conference of theAllies in June 1916;   Resolution B.Ill was as follows:-       ;  &quot;The Allies daclare themselves agreed to conserve for theAllied countries before all others their natural resourcesduring the whole period of commercial,  industrial,agricultural                                                            and
and maritime reconstruction, and for this purpose theyundertake to establish special arrangements to facilitate theinterchange of these resources.n                                   m         Ho positive proposals as to the manner in which thepolicy thus indicated should be carried out were pur forward atthe Conference and the British Delegates expressly stated theirview that no uniform method could fee adopted, as each commoditywould need to be considered separately, uniformity of treat-ment being impossible, and that it would be necessary to haveregard to the Commercial Treaty position in framing any policyto give  effect to the Resolution.,   No decision as to anycommon action has yet been taken, but the Committee onCommercial and industrial Policy, in their Interim Reportdated 14th December,1316,. have redommended that action shouldbe taken with a view to the conservation for the  UnitedKingdom and the Allies &amp;    of certain commodities of specialimportance of which there is likely to be a world shortage,The commodities to which the Committee directed attentionespecially were Raw Cotton  (Indian and Egyptian), Raw Wool,,Raw Jute, Flax, Hemp, Oil Seeds and Nuts, Metals (especiallyNon-Ferrous Metals), Hides and Tanning materials.         The Committee expressed the opinion that any measuresadopted for this purpose         &quot;should aim at securing to the British Empire and     the Allied countries priority for their requirements   , and should be applied only to materials which are mainly     derived from those countries and will be required by them.         &quot;This policy -should be applied as regards the     United Kingdom :by legislation empowering the Government                                                          to, I &apos; .&quot; 1 i. &apos; liui i  ii  &apos; ........J............. i    i   .   ..    i i i        . 0.  The Report was presented before the entry of the United     States into the War.
     to prohibit the export-, under licence,- of such^artieles as            X     may be deemed expedient.    Under these powers the export     of certain commodities which we specify should be controlled,     as well as that of any other important commodities,- in     the case of which there may be found to. be a dangerous     shortage.    The regime   should be administered with the     help of strong Committees on which the trades concerned     should be fully represented.         &quot;As regards the British Empire and the Allied     countries, the Government should without delay enter into     negotiation with the various Governments concerned, with     the view to the adoption of suitable joint measures as     regards selected Commodities of importance.&quot;          The entry of the United States into the War modifies theposition in two directions.    If the co-operation of thatcountry in the general policy of conserving Allied productionfor Allied needs during the Transitional Period after the Warcan be secured, the range of commodities to which the policymight be applied would be materially increased, and one of thegreatest difficulties in the way of its application would beremoved;  but on the other hand the anxiety felt in respect ofsome raw materials (e.g. wool and Egyptian cotton) is largely    to the  rapidity with which the United States demand hasincreased during the War. .         In these circumstances it appears desirable that animmediate effort should i^e made to disc ass with the UnitedStates the general principles to. be applied to this particularsubject and if possible to arrive at a clear understanding as tothe extent to which any one of the Allies shall be entitled topriority in respect of any particular&quot;supply, and the. machineryfor giving effect to aiich priority.
Essentially the-discussion must be one be Ween, theUnited Kingdom, Prance and the United States,  seeing that-they  are the three countries engaged in the War against the Central Powers, which mainly control supplies of important raw materials and  that the &quot;precise methods to be employed to control the distribution of those supplies, must consequently in any case be settled by these countries.    It is therefore desirable that in the first instance at any rate the proposed discussion should&apos;take the form of an exchange-sf views between these  three Countries rather than: a Conference ofin Paris or in London.     If this course is agreed to  inpTinc-iple it will be necessary to draw up a list  of the  moreimportant articles to which it may be suggested that thearrangements among the Allies should apply,  and to consider,.how best to arrive at some standard on the basis  of which  the-amounts to be allocated to the various Allied Countriesshould be fixed.all the Allies.The discussion should take place either20JUL1917
