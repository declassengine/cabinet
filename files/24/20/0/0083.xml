I 17 I: E 0 D TJ C T OR Y.       The withdrawal  of men  from  civil  life  fornaval  and military purposes  must  be based upon somecoherent theory if confusion ana  incompatible decisionsaro to be avoided.   J?or confusion breeds inequalityof treatment; &apos;. inequality of treatment  a sense ofinjustice;  a sense of injustice  hatred;  hatred of.Government, rovoIt and revolution.   In:this countrywe have reached.the stage of a rapid growth ofrevolutionary talk which has,, as  one of its moreimportant sources, the apparent injustice.of thepresent methods of taking men for the Army;.
                        P A R T. I.OUTLINE,OF THE THEORY, OF KSCRulTIKG,Iff Ail 1IOT3TRIAL STATE:4   1.  Proposals to secure men for the Army by what has beentermed the clean cut &quot;by age have frequently &quot;been put forward.They appear to be &quot;based either upon a theory that in war thepersonnel of the Army in the field alone matters and that thecivil activities of the nation-which support the Army can &quot;beignored or upon a theory that the value, of&quot; a man in civil lifeis a function of his age.  viie Military Service Acts and theAttestation Scheme were &quot;both &quot;baaed on some such theory.  Inpractice however,  an intricate system of occupational exempttions has been grafted ori to them.  The age basis theory persistsnevertheless and is embodied in the administrative machinery-.  2.   However suited so simple a theofy may have been in theHapoleonic Era and earlier it is unsuiied to the complicatedhighly industrialised Western nations of to-day, and alsobears no relation to the nature of present day fighting withits absolute dependence on munitions and machines of all sorts.       We have tgjfd^iJi and it has never worked.  5*urther ithas cost the country/ialiiidns*bt quite unprofitably spentmoney.  Prance and Germany have tried it and have had to adopta cumbrous procedure of returning soldiers to the workshops inan effort to undo the fundamental errdr.       There can be little doubt that in the complicated highly-industrialised modern state all recruitment should proceed upona basis of occupation conditioned by age and physical fitness.This may be termed the &apos;Occupation-Group Theory* of recruitment.       As only highly-industrialised states can produce art&apos;adquate supply of the engines of war, recruitment on the Occupa-tion-Group basis appears likely to supersede all other methods.  3.   Precisely to understand what is meant by the *Occupation-Group v Theory of Recruiting;it is convenient to take a hypotheticalcase.  S is an industrialised state,   its male inhabitants areengaged in one or other of four groups,of industries.  Group Acorapstlses internal luxury trades. Group B export.luxury trades.Group C trades useful arid in some parts essential.  Group D tradesalmost wholly essential to the life  of the state in peace and war.       The Groups might then be drawn on as follows for draftsof men for military purposes:1st draft.

It is necessary to examine briefly something    less artificial.              *        4.     - The. essential characteristic,of the.England of    to-day is the existence of vast agglomerations, of human&apos;&apos;-feeings    in discrete areas, e. g., the East Riding of Yorkshire.  In  -these agglomerations there are great eities                  . \  nuclei.   The mark of an agglomeration is that within its own    boundaries it can neither grow its own food nor provide  .  -sufficient water catchment lor its needs.                The existence of such agglomerations hypothesizes   . therefore the existence elsewhere of food producing and  -  water catchment areas, probably also a fuel producing area,    and the existence of a traffic system which brings; the food,    the water,, the fuel, and all other things they require to    the people of the agglomeration.        5.     ;&apos;7/heh. a.nation goes to war its first step is to    create new agglomerations often on the largest.scale.    Fleets assemble at war basea;  armi es appear*in&apos; t he fieId.    like the civil agglomerations, these too, require traffic    systems of their own.. Unlike a civil agglomeration they    require not only tilings to use, but many things to destroy.                The traffic demand of a war agglomeration is    enormous therefore and as these. agglomerations are liable to  v move, their traffic system cannot have tho permanency and    therefore the economy of those of the civil agglomeration.               ; The first care therefore tt ft state at war should    ;be to protect the three links of its foud chain which includes    the corn lands where its food is grown, .the machinery which    collects, transports and distributes dt and the homes where    it is consumed.  Similarly with its raw materials.      &apos;          Hot. only howeyer,. must the oentral link (the  - traffic link) be protected,,  it must, be expanded to meet the    Heeds of the new agglomeration and it must bo maintained    against the almost, certain damage which the enemy will beII   able to inflict upon it.3rd draft.B)C)4th-draft;.ABt
    6.      Where there is no question of military defeat,thai first visible sign that the service of the traffic hasbeen ignored, will be the growth of anxiety about the foodsupply of the agglomerations.  If the traffic be maintainedfood can continue to be. gr.own in the places in which it wasgrown in peace.  If the onemy succeed in interrupting the.traffic by seizing the corn lands or by blockade or by des-tarejjiii^ the carrying machines,&apos; it&apos; becomes - necessary togrdf? food in places where- it did&apos; not grow in peace;            If this happen, the enemy has wn a considerablesuccess.  He has compelled his adversary to utilise in -growing food a portion of his Mah-power whioh otherwisewould have been available to be used agains.t him*            This is now our position,  Through carelessnessover the maintenance and expansion of our: traffic we havebeen forced to divert a portion of our Man-power, to breakin - land that has not known-, the plough for a generation.    7.      Having provided for the protection of its vitalcentres and its traffic,, the second care of the State at warmust be to equip itself with and to maintain the vastaccumulation of machines of all sorts required to attackits enemy.  This attack may be its sole defence but in .theory at least to secure its own life is the first care ofthe. State at war..    8.      If the line of thought which runs through theforegoing paragraphs be even approximately correct thispreliminary analysis of the theory of recruiting in thehighly industrialized modern nation at war lias proceededfar enough to make- it plain that not only&apos;the Armies requiremen and to render it possible to lay down certain provisionaladministrative principles to govern the withdrawal of men -from civil life for military purposes.    9,      Belters stating what those administrative principlesshould be it is necessary to recognise that we haveso: sufferedfrom false doctrine that a really scientific application of &apos;the rules is no longer possible to us.  Knowing them, it maybe possible to avoid further bad mistakes and even to securesome measure of re-adjustment.
             PART  II,ADMINISTRATIVE PRINCIPLES OF RECRUITING.1.     As the modern army in the field is an agglomerationgenerally similar to a civil agglomeration, no age limitshould he imposed upon the rights of the State to:call, uponmen to serve with the army.  Physical unfitness to performthe work required - should be tfre sole limitation.       NOTE;   There are many men of 45, even of 55 who   -V   . : ;     are much-fitter and can be more -usefully              and economically employed with the army              than younger men, e,g, a B2 partner in an            /important,textile firm aged ,56 employed on              labour with the army; contrast a labourer              aged .52., remaining, in Civil life employed              on non-es3ential work.-2.      The  State mu3t  know ,accurately in individual detailwhat  its  male  resources are,  what  each individual is - doing,where he  is living-  and where he is employed.   This implies   &apos;;an  accurate and enforced system of registration.   It also im--plies the existence  of some  definite means of identification,e. g.,  the carrying of  an identity  book by all males.  In thisbook,  there would  require to  be a  photograph of the&apos; individualto  whom it  belonged  or else  hi3 finger-print record.    -    NOTE:   Atpresent it is quite impossible to determine.               with absolute  certainty the identity of many .               individuals whose interest:it is to conceal               it.&apos;  Hot only  do men change their names,  but               there  are many men with identical names,  wjgo ,can               only be  recognised by their address or employ-               ment,  so that  it is  comparitively an easy mat- ,               ter  for  Impersonation to occur.-3.      The  registration system must -be organised on a.basis &quot;of  occupation  groups within which  provision must be m4de forthe recognition Of age.

Individual,  domestic and financial interests should  not per se be a ground for exemption, but should be dealt with  on a basis of compensation.    This implies that a tribunal  should decide the amount of compensation that  the State-should  rightly pay it is withdrew the individual from civil life.  The  calling up of the more expensive recruits would naturally be  postponed by the State, until such time as the pressure for men  made it necessaryto incur the cost involved.            - U0TE:Thl8 system should apply to the owners of                  businesses,  large or  small]  not to employees,                  nor to compensation for the withdrawal of em-                  ployees.   The administration; would not be                  difficult.    It would be easy.to establish a                  scale of compensation-amounts  which-.would be                  regarded as&apos;equivalent to a certain increase                  in age.6.      Individual exemptions should be based on    *  compassionate grounds omly and then by a tribune aamlnister-: ;  ing a clearly defined scale..  Vox. example,^exemption might&apos;  be given to the only surviving male member  of a family of  Which at lenst one member had lest his life in the service of  the country.    Similarly one aon out ofHiixymight be exempted  if five sons were serving in the itevy or Ariiry.  /Again,  a.  marri ed man with seven children. might. be exempted,  a widower &apos;  with, five, etc-..                                .           &apos;. .KQTE;Such exemptions,  though possibly illogical in                  the interest of the State are demanded on                  grounds of public policy. They appeal to  the                  sentimental side of thferpopulation and. do much                  to easethe. feeling Of resentment against  com-                  pulsory exposure to a high  risk of death  and                  mutilation.:  Tribunals in dealing with such                  cases should merely.be required.to  establish                  the facts.   If established, exemption ^should                  follow automatically and notmbe at  the  whim of                  a local tribunal,  .7,      Appeals from the decisions  of recruiting medical  boards &amp;*ould,  in the interests of public  confidence, be  allowed to all men.    They should be dealt with by the exiet-  ing (lay)Appeal Tribunals.&apos;.  Thes.*, should tUcide *J*    * p.e.*i
appeal with the assistance of not less than two offic-ial medical assessors, who should &quot;be under an obligationto consult with the President of the recruiting medicalboard whose decision was under appeal in all cases ofdifference of opinion,                   GEiTOAL ITOTB.     The necessity of allowing appeals as indicated bythe above, malces it necessary to continue the Tribunalsystem on the genera1 dines of that which now exi3ts.For reasons of policy, it is px^obably desirable that nochange should be made either in their composition or intheir distribution, &apos; &apos;:\ Their powers should, however,  belimited to ascertaining matters of fact such as whethera man does or does not rightly belong to an occupationgroup and therefore is or is not subject to the conditionsof recruitment attached to that group as well as thematters of-fact indicated in the preceding paragraphs.
THE EXISTING POSITION JaffTH JfflBGAjj^TQ ,RSQ^ITCTQij.    1.  MATERIAL  Our resources of Man-Power at the outbreak of far of&apos;the&quot;age period 16 to 60 in England Scotland and Wales, was approximately 13^- million men.        Including the Army,  Special Reserve;and Territorial Force as they existed in August 1914 we have absorbed:for military purposes in theee  years nearly 5,000/000 men.   The Navy i3 estimated to have absorbed approximately 500,000 men. into the ranks of its Naval and Marine personnel.  There.are therefore, approximately 8  million males,.less normal wastage, who were of the age period 16-60 in 1914 remaining in civil life.!  The balance of.the new crops which have matured in the interval and have remained in civil life approximately main- tain, without reinforcing,  that number. ;  :  -        Of the 8 millions, approximately $00.,000 fall in the a^e period 18 to 25.  This is not however to be taken as physically a fair sample of the pre-war population.  It has been skimmed of its fittest, first by voluntary enlistment, later by the working of the Military Service Acts. : It  is estimated:that about 600,000 of these young men are not and never will be fit for Category A.  Approximately 500,000 remain.  These eii&amp;e^are or might become fit for Category A.        Of these 300,000 A.  and potential A. men not less that 100,000 are employed in and about coal-mines,  about 120,000 in and about ship-yards,  marine engineering shops and munitions works, including among them some of the most highly skilled men in the engineering trades.  ;The remainder are distributed over Agriculture, Railways,, the Transport Trades, while a few remain  in certified occupations and in Government offices.  It is  possible that by calling up  the men slowly,  say over a period of 6 or 8 months,  200,000 of the 300,000 might be obtained for the Army.  This is how--- ever the maximum and wi 11. only be reached if withdrawals of aider men are carefully regulated.     Vv. In the age period from 26 to 41. inclusive there  are approximately;3, 000,000 men still in civil  life.  Like  their juniors they are not physically a fair sample  of the pre-war population.   The winnowing  out of the fitter men has been going on for three years.  In result it is  estimated that at the outside,  25$ of the remaining total are fit for Category A.  That gives a body of 750,000 on which the  Army can  draw.        If the 200,000 young men are to be got  out,  and  if our war industries are  not  to be crippled,  and if the fabric of our trade is to be maintained,  at such close  estimating as is possible where so many factors are unknoTtfi,  it  is suggested that not more &apos; than 20^ of the 750,000  are recruita- ble, say 150,000 men.
       We therefore have reached a point at which we can see no more than 350,000 men recruitabl o apar t fr om the new  or op unless the age limit of 41 be abolished and all men of ail   . ages become available1 for recruitment in accordance with the principles already laid down,   That measure might produce a further 120,000 -  150.000 really fit men who could be taken into the Army in a period of from six to eight months V     :  We have therefore to realise the fact that, apart from the new crop, less than 500,000 men constitute our total remaining military assets and further that the recruiting of these men must be  conducted with great care to provide time and opportunity of readjustment.       It is important to note that for the first six months of this year during, which casualties: have been low the wastage; (not permanent loss) has averaged nearly 70,000 men a month,       Wi th. r egar d  to the new crop,  the pre sent position is very unsatisfactory,       In each of the heart two calendar years approximately 360,000. lads will  attain the age of 18V   Of these, experience-Suggests, that from 70$ to 7.5$ possibly a fraction more-, will be fitor under training will become thoroughly fit, for Category At.i.e. from 250,000 to 270,000 lads should be available annually or 21,000 to 23,000 a month.                 position is, that  in April and May of this year,  by which time the flow: of boys attaining age 18 should have reached its normal level,  we were only obtaining a monthly average of 18,000  Category iula&amp;a.    That is to say,  at that rate over 4,000 per month,  or,  say,  50,000 in a: year, of Medical Category A., were escaping&apos; Mi       Service through exemptiont  etc.                  *&quot;    -       In June :the  position became much more serious.    During that month the intake of Category A,  lads was only a little over 12,000.    ;&apos;:During - July  to date, the position has tended to become worse.   At the present rate our total for the month will not exceed 10,000.                             pi?\       On this basis lads aged 18:fit for Category A,  to the number of: at, least. 100,000 per annum.are securing exemptions from or are at least postponing 31111tary Service.      :The youths of age 16 born:ih  the first helf of 1899 who are at present protected from military service are distri- butedin: the following manner:       Nearly: 25,000 are in Cdntroiled Firms,  etc       Over    5,000 are Railway Snplbyees.       Over - &apos;  2,500 are engaged in  Transport Trades.       About  16,500 hold Exemption from Colliery Courts.       ilearly  5,000.are exempt by Ministerial pledges etc, ( Students)       Over    8,000 have Applications Outstanding to Tribunals                                             h Colliery Court.Total62j000

If the petition with regard toavailable personnel be difficult, the psychological positionis worse.            -v There is a feeling widespread in the public mind -that there is no, national policy with regard to the.distribu- -tion of man-power. -  The small tradesman is at; the moment inthe very focus of:the activities of the. recruiting machine.He sees his friends - and his neighbours called up.   He knowsthe ruin which av/aits them on their return.   He knows hisOwn turn is corning.   He sees the great Co-operative Stores  .and the big multiple shop organisations picking up thebusinesses which were theirs and his..  , He hears that hisneighbours, who hav e jo ined the colours have&apos; not be en taken for-military, duty but have been incorporated ,in AgriculturalCompanies or Transport Workers1&apos; Battalions or are employed indelivering&apos; coal to Government offices in London.              He lays the blame at the door of the War Office,on the Government.   He points to the young man in the munitionshops as proof that the Government is in the hands of acapitalist armament ring or is frightened of the Trade Unions.He has no conception of the position of the country or of thestrain to which it is subjected.   He understands nothing of the theory of recruiting.   His newspapers have dinned the parrot-cries    &quot;Youngest First1? and &quot;Single Men First&quot; into his ears until he believes that these contain all the wisdom of themoderns and the ancients.&apos;     The other side is worse.   Young single men left in works .and factories in the national interest, believe that as they areyoung and single they should have been taken for the Army, an*twould have been if the Government had dared.    Imagining it weakand afraid of them, they despise it..   And in their despising fall victims to tic  vapourings of the cranks and faddists whoalone talk to thorn.     The nation is rattled; partly,  by the excitement of theRussian Revolution; partly, by the price of food;  partly, bycasualties,, by the sight of the widows and of the broken menreturning, but largely, because it does not understand the  .&apos;greatest of all our problems, the problem of Man-Power upon: which all else depends.     The recent w&amp;ia outburst about the medical boards was asymptom of the unrest.   They have been bad. &apos;   A year ago; the jwere very bad but slowly and surely they have improved and in;fact they never were better than at the moment when the stormbroke on them.     That is not to say they were perfect.   They were not.The unpopularity hf an Act of Parliament, the carelessness ofthree or four Boards,  lighted the match which brought theexplosion.   3)he situation momentarily is eased but. its --&apos;dangerous elements remain and will remain till the. countryunderstands and sees the Government Policy with regard to ManPower clear before it.
 1.      The outstanding difficulties of the situation  at  the present time are psychological.:  Of these the most  important are I -            ;/^/:&apos;/     .    -        (a) The sense of unprotectedness,. helplessness and            injustice whieh haunts the mind of the man with            a little business or a small holding  of  his own.        (b) The belief of the young man in the munitions  shop            that he is there because the Government  is afraid  ,          of him.                     --y^Cfy^&apos;^^ ---&quot;-/.        .        Until these are eradicated things cannot  go  right. The - first essential: therefore ii to educate&quot;the  country on the1 three following points :-        (I)- Age does not determine a man&apos;s&apos;usefulness  to  the            Scafce in.Peace or War, in civil or in military            employment. -           -        (2) The ilation at War requires to maintain a balance  -        ;.:&apos;/&apos;; in olie distribution of its mental&apos; and, physical            vigour between its armed forces-and the  civil     &quot;::-v;/-:-;/ services, and Indus tries which directly  and           . indirectly support these forces.     .;  (3) In withdrawing- men from civil life for military            purposes, the degree of usefulness of the   lan1s  -.    - &apos; ,- - -c.i.:vJJx -:-A:xy\:przLio&apos;0 ^x^-                 -f^aojvor -end        .    only wtien it is decided that men  to be with-           .drawn from an occupation does the question of -:./selecting those, most; suitable for military  -          purposes&apos; arise.-        If the country realises and understands these  three ^principles,  the;s ituabion&apos; wi11.at once be eased.  If  further, the-one-man business men/whose,;allris at / stake,  realise  that; the nation/appreciates ^bheir /sacrifice.; and  wi 11^ so&apos; far as may be, corapor^ate thera or their dependents, the string ;will  be drawn from much of the spirit of unrest which is abro^u.  inv/ this - country * -  . y:&apos;-y                           .          - -.&apos;: &apos; &apos; - &apos;&quot;. 2.-- - ..- The next, difficulty is - with: certain essential industries..  These ought to be working harder than  ever  before, In, fact, they are disorganised and short of  labour-  Much of this is our own-fault.In the past we have  failed  to recog- nise the  vitalimportance of protecting and  expanding our.- traffic - systems interrial! and- ;external;, in... consequerice we are now laboriously expanding old, and creating  new  industries.        It is absolutely necessary to get the public to understand.that;in;staffing.these new industries, a certain proportion of young fit. men must be permitted to be absorbed. for they  alone have the mental and physical  adaptability and aptitude  required.

 important..^ - Every occupation, moulds the &quot;bodies of the men who follow-it,  to its own needs.   At the quickest,  .this takes months,- in extreme cases years,- and until this moulding is completed, - the. worker- is, not at his &quot;best, \Only-.young bodies can be moulded.rapidly;  the re are Industries .at whioh adults can never become proficient..        If this be. once, understood, the w; ole country will 8 toady, &quot;and it will  be possible to proceed with recruiting..    3.   For the moment it does not seem practicable to go much further.&quot;,with.&apos; outward change *  The next essential is to get the - whole recruiting&apos; (administrative) machine swung: over from an age to an occupational basis..        Plans have been prepared in .detail to effect this.   -  - The forms of register&apos; etc,,. are all ready,, set in type and. printing off.; can begin at&apos; short, notice.-:, - -        -        The administrative change will take about&apos;two months.- to carry through to  completion.-                            -  &quot;        ?/hile it is being carried out the older one-man- business men should  be granted a period of respite from re- cruitment nominally  until adequate financial/provision can be made f or thtm on  the 1 ihee*, suggestedby the President of the Local Government Board (See G.T.. 1560*).&quot;        Simultaneously it is suggested that, the War Cabinet should cancel all existing Government exemptions of lads of 18 and definitely order that no new exemptions of this type are to be.granted to lads of 18. unless they can show to the.--&apos;satisfaction of the  Local Enlistment Complaints Committee that they have pass  through .an apprenticeship as engineers.     /&apos;7  Por the rest,. Government Departments should be instructed to press  on with the release of their quotas through the machinery already established.  The de-certificating of .;. all young men in the mines will automatically dispel any - difficulty about the lads of eighteen in that trade if it predede and does not succeed the proposed ballot for quotas. (see G.T.- 1318.)                - \&apos;;\        In the autumn,  it is suggested&apos;/: legislation should be introduced to give effect to the,administrative principles suggested in Part II of this memorandum, more especially to the abolition of the age limitations and;to the recasting of the. powers of Tribunal3.-          &apos;        The suggestion put forward in Paragraph 7, Part II. with regard to Medical Appeals can be instituted at an early date in fact so soon as is politically expedient in relation to. the operations of the Select Committee of the House of Commons which is no?/ sitting.              &apos;      .  In summary, the immediate practical proposals in so far as the supply of men for the Army is concerned are these:        (l)  Deal with the psychological difficulties first.        (2)  Transform the administrative machine from an age            basis to  an occupation basis organisation.
  (3) Push on with the release of the quotas already      ordered.  (4) End all Government protection of lads &quot;between 18      and 19 (except as provided above).  (5) Undertake in the Autumn new legislation on tho      lines indicated in Part II.These suggestions do not however end the problems     The provision of labour for certain industries is vital.It may conceivably be proved necessary to release a certainnumber of skilled men from the Army.   But by far the most effective. way of supplying labour to ah industry is to open, and toadvertise an ^umbrella1.   All that is necessary to secure animmediate1&apos;drift1 of workers into an occupation is to announcethat all of a certain age who are in it before a certain datewill be regarded as being entitled to conditional exemptionso long as they remain employed in it.   In a few days1 time,the drift begins and&apos;the pressure generated by the working ofthe recruiting machine will maiirtaln-the flow.     If to the announcement that all men entering&quot; the specifiedoccupation by the specified date ?jere added, the promise thatall qualified by ago to receive conditional exemption wereentitled to enrol under conditions .as to separation andtravelling cllo?/ances generally similar to those of the WarMunition Volunteer or Army. Reserve Munition Worker, there :canbe little doubt that the drift would bo adequate.     Finally there remains the:;problem of Industrial Compulsionunder the pov;ers of the Military Service Acts such as is effect-ed by Agricultural Companies etc.. &apos; If they are absolutely ,essential they must remain but there can be no doubt that theirexistence- is an unhappy necessity and- seriously complicates thedifficulties of an uneasy situation.     Their existence has this unfortunate effect.  At the timewhen, above all others the War Office should have the trust ofthe Nation,-they present&apos; the War Office to the Hation as anindustrial eompulsitor.  Ifthe  mon can be obtained by asystem comparable to that of the War Munition Volunteer, muchwill be gained,     Nothing, however, that can be done will end the presentdifficulties unless: it-be preceded by the blearest possibleInstruction of Parliament, the Press and the Country on thetheory which it appears should underlie all military, recruit-ment in a highly industrialised modern state even thoughit be now too late to apply that theory either completely or scientifically.                            &apos;.
