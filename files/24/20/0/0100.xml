Board of Trade,                                         Coal Mines  Department,                                           8 Richmond Terrace,                                              Whitehall,                                                 London. S.TJ7.1.  P/g049/R.M.                            20th July,  lSlT.  Dear Mr. Hodgson,       With  reference to  your letter of the 18th July intimating  the  request of Lord Milner and Mr. Barnes for Weekly Returns  shewing  a  proportion of the quotas of miners actually released  by my Department,  I may explain that the method in which miners  have been  released for  the Army during  the past six months is  either :-           (a)  by withdrawal of Exemption Certificates from                individual miners by the  Colliery Recruiting                Courts in pursuance  of the different schemes               ,of recruitment agreed upon from time t6 time .                between the Home Office or my Department and                the  Director of Recruiting, i.ev, surface workers,                or men who entered the industry after the                15th Augustj 1915,  or           (b)  by De-oertifioation Order issued by the Home                Secretary, as took place  on the 12th-May in the                case of mon who entered the industry after the                4 th  August, 1914.       In  either of  those two ways  certain categories of men are  released for service, but it is not possible to ascertain at  the  time of such release the number of  men who will come within  that category, or  who will be medically passed for general  service; moreover, some of them may obtain exemption on personal  grounds  from the Local  Tribunals,       Once  the men  have  been released in either of  these two  waysj the  War Office then proceeds to call them up and my  Department hea*s nothing more about it  except when they are  asked to intervene on behalf of persons who, or whose employers,  consider that they do not come within one of the agreed  measures of recruitment.   t understand that the Director of  Recruiting receives ones a; week from his Local Recruiting  Officers the numbers of miners who are  posted for  service, and  this information forms,  I apprehend, the basis of  figures  which  he sends to my Department from time to  time.   I suggest,  therefore, that  the best method by which the wishes of Lord  Milner and Mr. Barnos can be met  is for them to ask the  Director of Recruiting  to send them weok by week particulars  of the numbers of  miners posted for service.
$     (2)      The latest figure received frsm the War Office      stating the number ef miners who have been released en account      of the 40,000 awarded to the Army this year by the War      Cabinet is 19,256.   Part of this sum. however, represents men      not yet posted and 1$ therefore an estimate.   When I put  ;      this figure to my A dvisory Board Yesterday there was a general     &quot;feeling on both sides, and partieularly on the men * e side, that      ii did not accurately represent the hummer of men released oh      account of the 40,000.   They did not for a moment suggest that      the inaccuracy was in any way intentionali but they expressed the      opinion that miners when Called up for service do not always      describe themselves as miners,  but rather as hauliers,&apos; putters,     : trimmers, drawers, stonemen, crushers- shifters, etc.,- the -      term &quot;miner&quot; bfing generic and in many.eases - not likely to be      used by a miner when describing his occupation.   Moreover, there      are many classes of surface workers, such as banksmen, screeners,      stokers, boiler firemen, carpenters, labourers, weighmen, fitters,      joiners, sawyers, wagon and tub makers arid repairers, etc., etc,     -who&apos; are&apos; all miners and all come within the jurisdiction of the      Colliery Recruiting Courts, arid yet very few of such men would      be lively to describe themselves as miners.               My Board also expressed the opinion that the confusion      arising from this description was particularly likely to arise,      in the case of young lads who, on attaining the age of 18,      receive calling-tip notices and, though entitled to Exemption      Certificates, frequently find themselves in the Army, so my      Board allege, before the&quot;Exemption Certificate from the      Colliery Recruiting Court has arrived.   I thereupon told      the men1a side vt the Board that, if they doubted th^ accuracy      of the War Office figures, it was for them to prove that they      were wrong, arid I accordingly called upon them  * promptly to      produce to me the names of all men who have left the mines for      the 4rmy.since January, otherwise than by the agreed schemes.      I pointed out to them that, when 1 received the results of such      a Census together with the names of the meji. X could then      take the matter up with the Director of Recruiting, but that, 4ft      the absence of such information, the figures of the Director      of Recruiting must he accepted.               X also told them that It would he necessary to recruit      2,000 more miners, making 4 ,000 altogether1 for this year,      because of the exemptions that it was necessary for me to claid      at the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 13 jh July on behalf      of the men engaged in distributing coal in tondon.   Having      regard, however, to the doubt which they had formed regarding      the War Office figures, they declined to express any definite      opinion upon this extra 2,000,  until the figures were verified      when I have no doubt the me^ will be forthcoming.(3)      I&apos;also put before them the suggestion made byGeneral Geddes at the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 13th Julythat a De-certifiication Order Should be issuad at once, makingavailable for Service the unmarried miners between 18 and 25(with the exception of certaih barred classes) from whom we arenow recruiting the balance of the 40,000.   X pointed out thata De-Certification Order would expedite the recruitment of thesemen because.the period of two months (to which a minerentering the industry before the 15th August -1915,- is entitled,ii unattested, by the Kilitary Service Acts,and, if attested,  bynecessary analogy therefrom) it being undoubtedly the casethat in this way the men would fcecome available for Service twoor.-tnre* weeks earlier than by withdrawal of Sxemption Certificates                                                    by the/
Colliery Recruiting Courts,   The me^s side,  however,  werestrongly opposed to this course, and indeed it was one of themain points made by the Miners1  Federation in accepting theproposal for recruitment from unmarried miners between 18 and25 that it should be done through the Colliery Recruiting Courts.Their objection was that by the method Of the Colliery RecruitingCourts you only release the  men you actually want, whereas byDe-certification 0rder you release the whdle  category^ onlysOfflo of whom&apos; will be feeledted to form the quota, while, in thecase of the others, their protection is equally lost,  and theyare liable to be celled u$ should any local Recruiting Officermake a mistake.  Moreover, if a De-CeiHification Order is madfc,,although the two months period begins to run at once,  no manknows whether he is affected by it or not until the ballothafe been held and the names  definitely ascertained! so. that thetwo months period is really cut down to something very much  vless, and they claim that they,were promised two months fromthe time a man knows that he has to go.     The method of recruiting now adopted was arranged afterconsultation with the Director of Recruiting&apos;s Department,arid I feel very strongly that it is uriwise to change it, justas it is being initiated, and the result would in my opinionlead to further delay as the Miners1 Federation would claimthat the whole question should be reconsidered, the result-being that the men would actually be at the disposal of theMilitary Authorities at a later date than if De-certificationen bloc was resorted to.     I am sure that both Lord Milner and Mr.  Barneswill appreciate the fact that the Miners can be led butnot driven.   At the present time I believe it to be a factthat, although it is not entirely absent, there is less unrest among.Ahe-jaiiisftsa than among other classes of workmen, and  I believethis to be due to the fact that  we have never broken a bargainwith them and have always taken  them into our confidence,  end Ibelieve it to be in the interest of present and future recruitingthat nothing should happen to jeopardise this.                         Yours faithfully,                     (Signed)   GUY CALTHRO?.0, M. Hodgson,  Esq.,  - The War Cabinet,       Z Whitehall Gardens,       1,
