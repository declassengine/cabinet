MEMORANDUM  BY THE MINISTER  OF  LABOUR.      PROPOSED  EXTENSION  OE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.     Part II. of the National Insurance Act, 1911, provides for the insurance against unemployment of the building, engineering, shipbuilding, and certain other trades, and the number so insured at  present is about 2-j million, viz., about 2,000,000 men and 200,000 women.                              -     -  .  .   The Act passed last  year  extends unemployment insurance as a  temporary measure to certain trades  which are largely engaged on war work and to. munition workers as  such.  The number insured under this Act is about 1^ million, viz., 700,000 men and  550,000.women.: ,  - -. The total, n umber at present insured against  unemployment under the  State scheme is therefore about  3&apos;^.million, viz., 2f million men and  -f million women.     The Women&apos;s Employment Sub-Committee of  the E-e-construction Committee, in an interim report dated 19th January 1917, expressed the opinion that the  present provision of unemployment insurance does not  afford sufficient protection for women in  industry as  regards  unemployment after the war, and tliey recommend that powers should he  taken to cover all such women by  unemployment insurance on the lines of &quot;the Act of  1916, and that this power should be  exercised except in trades which show that for some special reason they may be safely left uncovered.     I regard this recommendation  as deserving of the most serious  consideration. It is of  course obvious that to attempt to  bring all women workers,  or even  large sections  of women workers, indiscriminately under unemployment insurance without full consultation  beforehand with representatives of employers  and workpeople in the trades concerned would be an  unwise step.  The proper course in my  opinion is to select the  trades or groups of  workpeople which prima  facie appear to be in need of  unemployment insurance,  and then  to enter into negotiation with  these trades or groups.   If a prima facie case  for inclusion of a trade or group is  made out, it would be for this trade  or group, if  it raised objection to  inclusion, to  show that insurance is  unnecessary  because provision against) unemployment is made in some other way.                  -.     Before any such negotiation can take place, it is  necessary  that the Ministry of Labour should  have power to extend the Act in the way suggested, if they should think it necessary to do so.!  The Act of 1916 does give the Ministry power to extend its provisions to any trade  in which a substantial amount of munitions &quot;work or  other work for war purposes is carried on.: This,  however, does not  go far enough for the present purpose.   It is necessary that there should be power to insure,  should it appear  desirable  to do so, workers who cannot, strictly speaking, he said to be engaged in a trade in which a substantial amount of munitions work or other Avork for war purposes is carried on, e.g., workpeople employed as substitutes on Tramway systems might be a case in point.  It is also necessary that  it should be possible to: insure women alone without having to insure the men also, and this  cannot be done under the existing powers.    . A proposal for the inclusion in a Bill of a clause conferring the extended  powers referred to in the previous paragraph has  been submitted to  the Treasury, and has been rejected by them on the ground that an actuarial estimate of the probable cost of the extension is not put forward, and that so far as can be foreseen  it is probable that the extension would lead to a loss.  The Treasury in fact refuse to entertain the proposal unless and until I can provide  an actuarial  basis justifying it  from the financial point of  view.-v - ,  It is easily demonstrable that if the proposal must be justified actuarially before it can be adopted, no further progress can be made with it.  No actuarial estimate of any value can he made,  because whilst  the income that would be  derived  from contributions might he estimated with a fair amount of accuracy, there are no data for calculating, even within a very wide margin of error, the probable amount of the expenditure  on benefit.   Such  data would have  to consist  in  the  main  of  the probable degree and incidence  of unemployment, and for two good reasons these are not available.  In the first place the  trades which  would be  selected  for insurance would be largely selected for  the reason that  no provision against unemployment ...    a (33)3507 Pk 144  100 7/17 E &amp; S                   ..:     .. ^\&quot;&apos; V-;&quot;/&apos; -   V-.&apos;
 already  existed, and it would  therefore follow that there would be  no reliable experience as regards the rate of unemployment in the past.   In the second place, even were  such, experience ;as  regards unemployment-in i the; past  available, this would for obvious  reasons afford a very insecure basis for estimating the probable rate of unemployment in the period of disorganisation after the Avar.     It might be argued that as the probable amount of unemployment after the war in the  trades - now; in question  cannot  ibe\ estimated, with any accuracy, the proper. course to take, if. the matter is to be treated on a commercial footing, is to  charge a very high :premium in- orderi to- cover the risk, i.e., to make the contributions much higher or, the: rate.- of benefit: much \ lower --. than  the .usual ones.  1 This,  however j is impracticable beeause it. would involve, very serious  difficulties :in the administration of the scheme, and even if  these difficulties could be surmounted^ it would- not  he possible to  bring  the  workpeople  under-insurance  on ; these  terms.   They would certainly argue that.their- rate,of unemployment is much more: likely to be low after the,-war.than; to be high, and there wouldheno meansbf..disproving this contention. It may be observed that the terms of insurance as regards ratesi of- contribution and benefit were. determined on tactuarial:: advice, as regards the trades- originally  brought into insurance under the .Act of 1911.  These trades- were selected, on - the ground that- they.were  specially, exposed: to. fluctuations of  employment, and it would  be impracticable: to convince any new, tradei now to  be brought. in that; they ought; to come in under-more onerous conditions.     The  conclusion therefore is, that if 3 insurance ;.is to  be ^extended.-, at -all in the manner suggested,  it must be. extended on the-ordinary terms as applicable under the Acts of. .1911 and 1910 and the riskofi incurring-.a! loss: must be! taken.  -I regard it as of such importance \ that3 Ino substantial  body of workpeople ; should be: left - without some, provision for unemployment: after: the war (whether by,way of provision made by the. Trade I7imw^vamng&amp;mentS&apos;-7Miade1 betweens employers, and workpeople for short-rtime,working,. or  -otherwise, -or,;failing 1 all::of. these, inclusion-..under the&apos;State scheme) that  I  think;the risk of what,, comparatively speaking, would be-a small financial loss in the.working :of the scheme-should not he allowed to stand, in.the way of the proposal..      &quot;\   -               -   -  / : ;The: trades; which, I would; propose to- select for  consideration inthe; first instance as likely to require insurance against unemployment,-so far as. women-: are concerned, are. thej following; namely: &quot;Jb-ood,;.drink and :tobacco;. cabinet-making, upholstery and ^brush-making ;. gas, water, . electricityand - sanitary -services;  and transport workers.  The number  of females in these trades at  the  beginning of s 1917- may be estimated at about  200,000,- of whom; only,-about 3,500.,are:now .protected against unemployment through Trade U&amp;ions, wOther: trades in vwhich it may be -desirable to, .examjne, the desirability bf  extending&apos; unemployment insurance are  tailoring and shirtrmakmg,-where,the;.femalework                   170,000, of-whom only some 2,500 ;are: now protected; through ; their  Unions; and shop assistants and clerks, who number about  millkxtu-lessvthan:25,QQ0r:of whom: are^members of Unions providing unemployment benefit.  All these  are  ,of  course trades  in which the  number  of women employed  has, increased:enormously owing : to the -:war, and ? in which. there is therefore; likely, to be considerable displacement when normal: conditions return.  &apos;..July 10th, 1917.;r.  :o:.
