SECRET.                          INTELLIGENCE BUREAU,                                    Dep art men t o f In f ormat i on,                                           B\/A/009.I^^TEHAU^^^^  Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary.  IX-        The situation in Austria-Hungary is far too obscure to justify   the v/riting of a report at this moment.   The past week has been one   of rumours and circumstantial reports, most of which have proved   unfounded.   Por instance, the resignation of the Seidler Cabinet   was definitely announced via Berlin, while the resignation of Count   Czernin was also reported through a serious channel.   Heither report,   however, is true, and there are complaints even in Germany that it   is impossible, mainly owin^ to the. censorship, to obtain any clue   to the real situation in Austria-Hungary.   It was apparently for   this reason that Hindenburg and Ludendorff visited Vienna, in order   to make personal inquiries as to the true position.        Everything, then suggests that the process of disintegration   is continuing, but for the moment it seems necessary to suspend   judgment entirely and to await fuller details regarding recent   events.        Meanwhile one highly significant incident, not yet referred to   in the British press, deserves Special attention.   In the Con-   stitutional Committee of the Reichsrat on July 5, a conciliatory   speech by Professor Redlich (the well-known authority on British   Parliamentary procedure and local government) was countered in a   completely unconciliatory spirit in the name of the Czechs by Dr.   Stransky, whose daring speech, on the 14th June has been briefly   alluded to in Weekly Report VII, p.6.   Dr. Stransky definitely1^ announced the refusal of the Czechs to negotiate with the Germans   before the peace conference.   This attitude has caused a profound   sensation in the Reichsrat and is interpreted as an attempt fro link   the  solution of the Bohoniau problem with the European settlement
  as a whole.    At  the  same  time prominence  is  given  in the Austrian  Press to the exploits of the Czechoslovak brigade  in the Russian  army during  the.new offensive.  .  It  is  of  course denounced as  &quot;a  f&amp;lony&quot; and  exploited by. the Germans as a  proof of  the un-wisdom    JfcfcS Jumper or in; grant ing an amnesty.   ; Some one; appears to have-  .%*)t&amp;ed throughout the.Press the phrase that &quot;the  Czechs are  fighting . Vs-r; on two front a  -  that  of Galicia and  that  of the  Reichsrat&quot;.    .&apos; * On the  same  day  as  Straiieky* a statement, the, Magyar^Jewish banker,  Bsc^IS^                           Tisza party,  complained bitterly  Itt-the^Hungarian  Parliament of the treason of the Czechs  and argued  that &quot;while  the national wishes of Hungary are still  hot  considered,  a.nation many of  whose spiritual  leaders have been  condemned for  Hgh trea&amp;on IS being treated with leniency  in Austria1&apos; *    It  is ..intereating  to note that the speakerfs  remarks about  peace were  gr^e^ea^itfc storiiiy interruptions,  &apos;X)o  not agitate  against peace1,-i fUo one attacked  Germany *, &apos;The war  is  good business  for  the banks1, , tfcile a member of the Xarolyi party  urged  Baron Beck  to tell the  House something of  the profits made  by  his bank in  potted meat.  Meanwhile the new Hungarian government  is  proving itself  extremely  intolerant towards  the Roumanians.    A  flagrant cawe  is the con-  demnation of the  father  of the deputy Serban, a priest and an  old man  of 79, to three years&apos; imprisonment  for having entertained some  Roumanian officers  during  the invasion  of  Transylvania.R.W.S.W.
