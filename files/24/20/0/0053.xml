SJBCRBJP.;G.T. 1451     ,      WAR CA3IK3T.             COMMITTEE ON AIR.ORGANISATION          ;   AN33 HOME pSS-a AGAIlTsf &quot;Alg^UIPg *                    :v&apos;:First Report.     1*   The War babinet.  at their l8l a t meeting held on11th July, 1917, decided (Minute 3)          &quot;That the Prime Minister and General Smuts, a     in consultation with representatives of the Admiralty,     General Staff and Field Marshal, Commanding^in-Chief     Home Forces, with such other experts as they may     desire ehould examine  :-          1.  The defence arrangements for Home defence              against air-raids.          2.  The air organisation generally and the              direction of  aerial operations.&quot;     2.   We regard the first subject for our examination asthe more pressing and we deal with it accordingly in thisfirst report, so far as the defence of the Metropolitanarea is concerned.     .The second subject of  our enquiry is the more importantand will consequently require more extensive and deliberateexamination.   We propose to deal with it in a subsequentreport.     3.   London occupies a peculiar position in theEmpire of which it ia the nerve centre, and we consider,in the circumstances, that its defence demands exceptionalmeasures.   It is probable that the air-raids on Londonwill increase to such an extent in the next twelvemonths that London might through aerial warfare becomepart of the battle front.   We think, therefore, that itis necessary to take special precautions, so far as thedefence of London is concerned, and so far as this maybe done without undue prejudice to operations in theField and on the High Seas, as the fighting forcesmust, as a matter of general principle have the firstcall upon our output of aircraft and ant i-aircraft guns     4.   The arrangements for Home defence, includingthat of the London area, against hostile air-raids, havebeen undergoing a continual and rapid transformation,which, together with other causes,  hae militated againstefficiency.   In the first instance, attacks were madeby Zeppelins at night and our defences were so organisedas to deal with this form of attack.   Anti-aircraft gune,singly or in pairs, or in larger numbers, were placedat convenient points, and aeroplahe* of no great powercf speed were disposed at suitable  centres.     After some modification, the original dispositionswere found to &quot;be adequate to meet night attacks byZeppelins,   We have, however, now to meet attaoks ofan entirely different character, which take the formof invasions by squadrons of aeroplanes in formation,and our arrangements for defence are accordingly beingadapted to meetHils development.
     One cannot; however,  entirely preclude the possibilityof a repetition-of Zeppelin attacks,  and it wouldconsequently be-unwise to  abandon the earlier defencearrangements. -  Additions  to these arrangements, are,- however,necessitated rby the new &quot;formation attack&quot; by day.   The -defence against Zeppelins  was effectually carried out, -not only by individual anti-aircraft  guns, bnt also bysingle aeroplanes fitted with special armament.     As operations were conducted by night, -there was no - -question of formation either for attack or defence.   How,:-..however, that the attack is made by day by large enemy unite-in formation, one or two anti-aircraft guns firinig from -any particular point cahnbt hope to cause serious damage,-.and generally have no cfcer &quot;eff eci than that of ftighteningthe enemy pilots, while the defending aircraft, unless1ihey can also operate iii formation j are&apos; liable to teityeeri&amp;ue risk and cannot do much more than hover round theoutskirts of the enemy formation.-   An attack in formationcould, we think, only be properly met by a barrage firefrom guns concentrated in batteries at suitable points infront of the area to be defended, or by flights or squadronswhose object is, by concentrated attack, to break up thehostile formation and destroy individual machines after theyhave been scattered out of their formation.   .  5*   The relevance of these remarks is well illustratedby what happened in the Air Raid over London on Saturday,?th July.   The enemy machines attacked in definiteformation which they maintained throughout the raid.   Inour view they should have been met and repelled by aheavy barrage of gun fire before they reached London.Instead of this they were only subjected to a sporadicgun fire in the London area which did them no observabledamage.   As regards Aeroplanes on that occasion,we. actually disposed;of a larger number of first classmachines than the enemy, but our machines were distributedamong a number of Stations and some of them came in indriblets from various training centres.     Our machines were not in formation when in the air,and even when they attempted to concentrate they didnot come under a unified command in the air,  nor havethey been trained so to fight.   The result was thattheir very spasmodic, or guerilla attacks failed tomake an impression on the solid formation of theenemy, and the damage that was done by/
our superior numbers of first class R.F.C. machines was com-paratively negligible.             &apos;:-\-.&apos;::o&apos;.&apos;l:?&apos;;;^V:-::-V-;;-:^v.?--&apos;- :    Wo have investigated the circumstances in some detail andare informed that the reasons why greater results were notachieved were that:some of our pilots were not accustomed tothe new machines they weref lying,  that certain machines werenot used because of missing spare parts,  and a certain amountof shells that were fired were useless on account of defectivefuses.  These defects should, and can be remedied with allpossible speed,  but it is to the general arrangements andorganisation that we wish to refer more fully.     7, .I&quot;our separate agencies contribute  to the defence ofthe London Area against Air raidsj-     (a) Royal Naval Air Service,  which is not under the Home         Command,  hut works under the direction of the Senior        - Naval Officers in the Naval districts, but in co.-;         - operation. -as far as.: possible,  with the Home Defences.             There seems to be a general agreement among those         whom we have..consulted that for the limited purpose         Of the defence of London,  the present division of com-         mand in this respect should not be disturbed..             The principal function of the Roay1 Naval Air         Service squadrons is to deal with enemy raiders on         their return j ourney, as they re-cross the Channel *         They did so very effectively on the occasion of         the last raid, and after consideration of all the         circumstances, we are disposed to think that the         above squadrons should continue to operate under         separate naval commands,  but in close co-operation         with the Home Defence.                    ;  &apos;  ...     (b) TheObservation Corps, (distinct from the Royal Flying         Corps or Royal Naval Air Service),  which consists of       :  a number of observers round London, mostly Infantry         soldiers, often elderly and not specially qualified         for the duties they have to perform.             This Corps is directly under orders of the Field         Marshal Commanding Home Defences.     (c) Various incomplete units or single machines of the      ,,-  Royal Plying &quot;corps &quot;allocated to.-Home Defence,  under       &quot; the command of Colonel Higgins.     (&amp;) The Anti-aircraft jjuds of the London area under the         command of (foToneT&quot;simon.     8.  The last three agencies operate separately under ordersof the Home Defence Headquarters which is the only connectinglink between them.  This system.appears to us to involve toogreat a dispersal of command when dealing with a problem likethe air defence of the London area, which ia not only of veryfar reaching military and political importance , but alsoconstitutes a well-marked, distinct task, separable from otherproblemsof. Home Defence^-which accordingly calls for acorresponding concentration of executive command.   :..-. Our first; recommendation theref ore is that; :-Subject to the control^rtViP Field Marshal Commanding-in-Ghi^efjpf the Home forces, a^Seniof&quot;Offioer&quot; of    first-rate- ability
and practical air experience should be placed in executiveCommand of &quot;ihe air defences of the London area including the .above services t(bhlc).(d)J of Para., 7. above,  and thatth^sWHcer should^De^assIsted by a smaTTbut competent staff,who&apos; snoulcTpe ^specially charged with the duty ofworking pulpail plane for London Air Defences.  This offioer would takehis instructions from the Field Marshal and would in turnissue his orders to the observation Corps,  the Officer Coa-manding the anti-aircraft guns and the various Air Units.  Theunity of command which is essential to any warlike operation,whether of an offehsive or defensive character,  would thus beaohieved.  ^e think that this officer should be appointedwithout delay so that he may at once set to work to deal withthe various pressing problems connected with London airdefence,  some of which are referred to belowi      In view of the possibility of the recurrence of Zeppelinattack, as well as for Mother reasons,  we. think it would beinadvisable to remove the anti*airorftft guns from their presentstations in the London area.  In our view,  the best defensiveuse of anti-aircraft guns against hostile: aeroplanes attackingby day, would be for them to put up a barrage in front of andcovering London,  and our second recommendation accordinglyis that:*      Immediate attention should be given to the question ofthe; numbers j&amp;ljjS dispcsftTonl^ aTiti^ai^r^fX^^s^o^pui up,such a defensive barrage.       It  is  true  that  there  is  at present  said to be an insufficiency of  guns  for thiB  purpose  but,  as stated in paragraph 3  above;  we  regard the  defence of  London as so important as to call for exceptional  measures,  and special endeavours should therefore  he  made to  provide an adequate number of guns for this  purpose.       10. A more pressing problem, in  our opinion,  is the provision and organisation of a sufficient number of air unite,  trained, to fight  inN formation.&apos; and  their proper die- position  to  repel any  air attack  on London.   At present the only reliable unit formed for this purpose is the squadron specially detailed a week ago from the  western Front,  three other units  are in process of formation, but they neither have the necessary number of  machines,  nor have the pilots the re- quired training for fighting in formation.  We understand that an additional squadron^  complete in point of numbers, will be furnished almost immediately and posted to the North- East of London.   Another squadron to  be disposed to the South- $Sast should  be complete  in numbers in three  or four weeks. Both of thesewi 11,  however,  require to  be  properly trained toaanoonvre  in  formation  in suitable, units,   our third reoom- mendation therefore is that;-      ghe completion and training of; these three additionalsquadrons,  Bucdeagjvely,  be pushed on aa rapidly -aa possibleFrance,  should not be sanctioned until the :aifr. defence ofLondon is reasonablg secure.     11,  In the course of our investigation,  we consideredthe point whether our present type of fighting machine is thebest to cope with the slower,  but more powerful Sothk Hidert.In regard to this, we make no recommendations and lea*4 theproblem for the further considerationand study of the expertsof the Air Board, the Admiralty,  the War Office and the Ministryof Munitions.
     12.  The questioft of the provision of sufficient aircraftfor defence purposes and for the formation of a reserve isone which in our view1, requires careful and immediate consider^.ation.   The enemy may possibly adopt the ruse of sending asmall number of machines well in advance of his main attack inorder to lure our squadrons into the air;  the main enemy forcemay then appear on the scene and find himself unchecked, owingto the fact that our machines in coping with the advance patrolshad exhausted their petrol, and Our pilots, their energy.  Weare advised that theoretically, for our machines in the air todescend,, refill with petrol and reaseend to the proper height,-would take some A$ Minutes, but in practice, other factor^ wouldsupervene and the adtual time taken would probably be consider-ably longer.   The result might well be that the main enemyforce would meet with practically no opposition, and afterdoing the maximum amount of damage, might return to its base withimmunity and intact.   In view of suoh a situation, which mightwell arise at any time, we submit that it might be advisableto avoid sending up more units than are necessary on the firstwarning of a coming raid.   Such a contingency we think must becontemplated and to meet it reserves should be kept in hand.We accordingly recCmmend that :*     The air defence units for the London area should be sufficientnot oCly to cope wltll fein&amp;iT^but to meet the real, attack or apossible second, a-rtadk&apos;following close on a f^irst attacks     The formation and retention of such a reserve is only inaccordance with the general and elementary principles of warfare.     13*  We believe that if prompt effect is given to theabove recommendations,  subject always to the adequate andreasonable provision of aircraft for naval and militaryoperations by land and sea,  a fair measure of security for theLondon area from hostile raids may be obtained until/ at anyrate some unforeseen development takes place,
