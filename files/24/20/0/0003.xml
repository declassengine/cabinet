I. Letter from Mr. Snowden to Prime Minister, dated, 26th June, 1917.



Dear Mr. Lloyd George,



I write to you as Chairman of the Independent Labour Party. You are aware that the Government granted Passports to Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Jowett for the purpose of visiting Petrograd in response to an invitation from the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council.

You are aware also of the circumstances which have, up to the present, prevented Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Jowett from getting to Petrograd. On Friday last the Independent Labour Party received the following telegram:-



"Executive Committee of Petrograd Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Delegates expresses its deep respect to comrades Macdonald and Jowett, and cordially invites them to visit Petrograd and come in touch with Revolutionary Democracy of Russia. Tchkheidze, Chairman".

The present situation is intolerable and unless some action is taken to enable the delegates of the Independent Labour Party to go to Russia, there may be serious consequences.

I should be glad therefore if you could let me know immediately what action the Government intend to take in order to provide the necessary facilities for Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Jowett proceeding to Petrograd.

Believe me,

Yours very truly,

(Signed) PHILIP SNOWDEN.



II. Letter from Mr. Barnes to Mr. Snowden, dated 7th July, 1917.



Dear Snowden, 



Your letter of the 26th June, addressed to the Prime Minister, has been referred to me. I have been and am still trying to get the embargo removed, so as to facilitate the journey of Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Jowett to Petrograd. I now find that there is a likelihood of the embargo being raised during the next few days, provided no unforeseen circumstances


occur.   It would, however, greatly strengthen my hand, ifyou oould give me an assurance that in the event of theembargo being raised, Macdonald and Jowett would be pre-pared to proceed to Petrcgrad at once.  If, as I hope allgoes well, they may be able to start on their journey at theend of noxt week.                             :  Yours very truly,                          (Initialled)   G. N. B.III.  Letter from Mr. Snowden to Mr, Barnes,- v:.v&apos;.....,, :.. dated^uIFlQ-cfu 1917.$d&amp;y^Barnes,         In reply to your letter about Mr. Macdonald andMr. Jowetfs visit to Petro^-ad, I have to say that theirwishes and position are unchanged from, the time they wereprevented from carrying out their intentions.         \ have to add that if they start again it must heon&quot;.the condition that they are allowed to proceed to theirdestination without interference.                                    Believe me,                                       Yours sincerely                                (Signed)  PHILIP SNOViDEK-.    IV.,  Letter from Mr., Barnes to Mr. Snowden,     &apos; :&apos;      dated 10^ Ju&quot;:t.y, 1917.Dear Snowden,         Many thanks for your note to-day giving me.theassurance for which I asked.  I am sorry, however, to findthat I have put you to unnecessary trouble as I hear thatat the meeting to-day of Captains, Officers, Engineers andFiremen the previous resolution was re-affirmed;  the embargohas not been raised.                                Yours sincerely,                           (Signed)  G, MV BARUSS.V.  Letter fr;gm Mr^Snowden to Prime Minister,        dTted 12th Julyy 19T7.         &apos;&apos;&apos;Dear Mr. Lloyd George,         On the 26th June I wrote to you about the holdingup of Mr* Maodonald and Mr. Jowett.  You referred my letterto Mr, Barnes who has been good enough to communioate withme on. the subject,  He novr informs me under date July 10ththat captains, officers, engineers and firemen have passeda resolution re-affirming their determination not to allowMr* Macdonald and Mr. Jowett to go to Russia.         This brings us back to precisely the situation whichprevailed when I wrote to you on June 26th,  I have thereforeno other option than to repeat the request that I made to you
then, that you would be good enough to let me know what action the Government intend to take to provide the necessary facilities for Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Jowett proceeding to Russia.



You are aware that requests are being made from the Petrograd Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Delegates that Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Jowett should come to Russia immediately. This request has been endorsed by Mr. Henderson. It is within our knowledge that the impression prevails in Petrograd that the British Government is, by its complacency in the face of the action of the Seamen&apos;s Union, passively assisting to prevent our delegates from proceeding to Russia. Further inactivity on the part of the Government can only serve to strengthen and confirm this impression.

I am sure that you will realise the seriousness of this. In view of the long and serious delay which has occurred already I must beg the favour of an early reply to this communication.



I remain,

Yours sincerely,

(Signed) PHILIP SNOWDEN.

Chairman of the Independent Labour Party.
