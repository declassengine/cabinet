The accompanying copies of correspondence &quot;between theAdmiralty and War Off ice on the above subject are forwarded fbrinformation with reference to tfar Cabinet 180, Minute 19, and tarCabinet 181, Minute 1,                           (Initialled)  M.P.A.H.2 Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.    16th July 1917.1.8-400/43/651,I.    Copy of letter,  undated,  from the Secretary, Admiralty, tfr  .  the Secretary/ War Office.   .Sir,-    I am commanded by My Lords  Commissioners of the Admiralty torequest you to  invite the attention of the Army Council to theurgent need for obtaining additional labour for shipyards and marineengineering works in order to ensure an inc reased output of Naval ancMercantile Shipping,    IhejB are 12*000  men required at present to meet the outstandingdemands for labour for this class of work and if the shipbuildingprogramme contemplated by the War Cabinet is to be executed notless than 100,000 inen will have to be found in the near future.  Thegreatest difficulty  is anticipated in obtaining suitable labour inthe required quantity as the reserve of labour in; the Country isalmost exhausted.    it is, therefore, clear that every possible sourceof supply must  &quot;be drawn upon to the utmost.    The demand  for labour in the shipyards is not only for skilledfflen.   Semi-skilled  and unskilled men who have experience of Ship-yard work are required equally with the skilled.    There are still  a very considerable number of men in the Armywbo before joining the Colours  were working in Shipyards or MarineEngineering Shops and My Lords  trust that the Army Council willrecognise the supreme importance of the shipbuilding programme andwill do all in  its power to facilitate the return 6f these men totheir civil employment&apos;.    tfader the. present arrangements between the R.O. Department ofthe Ministry of Munitions and the War Office it is rarely possibleto secure the return to civil employment of a soldier unless he is:-       (1) a skilled man in a skilled trade.       (2) over 2o years of age,,       (3) not  above the rank:of a corporal.       14) not  serving on a distant front.       \5) not  posted to a Technical Corps.
           My lords now suggest that the Army Council should relax hese conditions in the case of men who have had experience ofshipbuilding and shij^ropairing, and marine engineering, and areRequired for such work -     (1)  by sanctioning the release of semi-skillod and             unskilled men  &apos; :     (Z)  by sanctioning the release of men of all ages     (3)  by sanctioning the release of men of tho rank             of sergeant     (4)  by sanctioning tho release of men in Technical             Corps, unless the work on which they are   &apos;             employed in tho Army requires no less skill than             the work which would bo assigned to them in a             shipyard.           My Lords would further suggest that a special lettershould be sent to the Field Marshal Connnanding-in-Chief at GeneralHeadquarters requesting him to arrange that all soldiers orderedto be released from the Colours for work in the Shipyards ormarine engineering shops should be sent to England with as littledelay as possible.                                 I am. Sir, ..                                    Your obedient Servant, .                               (Signed)  B. Rv SCOTT.                                           for Secretary.                                II,  .     Gopy of letter,                              the - Seeretarg,     &quot;     v7ar&quot;IFflolTTo  the -Secretary.-  Admiralty,19/Releasef 878.        )    :-:;:^Sir,&apos; , /:/ :\-;-^flry-::           ; :  -          :/V&apos;-*\\v^      1 am commanded  by  the  Army Council to JJ^^^^^^^fof your undated  letter Ho. L.S./400/45/651 which has -referenceto the need for  obtaining additional labour for shipyards andmarine engineering works.      I am/to say that the Army Council have given their mostcareful consideration to the proposals  put forward by tho^Lords Commissioners and  desire me to plaoe the following faciabefore their Lordships.    1.    Tho Cabinet  by  various decisions and rulings, whichthey have -arrived at  and given;  have limited the field open toArmy recruiting  to such  an extent that  it is no longer possiblefor tho Army Council  to  obtain sufficient recruits to  maintainthe reserves essential to support the Armies on all the fronts.    E.    For - many months the recruitment of skilled mon hasb$en limited-by  conditions and pledges  which have n&amp;de itimpossible for the Army  Council to maintain the supply ofartificers necessary  for the Hoyal Horse. Field and GarrisonArtillery and for the Royal  Flying Corps.    3*  ,  Ftfr many months, the Army has beoa subjoot to  art unceasing drain  for men of varying grades of skill for work in connection with the production of Food, Aircraft Munitions.
 SMds and Marine Engines.   Among these one of the lesser items has been the release from thu Colours or transfer oo the Reserve of 6,080 skilled men for work in Marine Engineering or Ship Building or Ship Repairing Yards.       4,   The Army within the1 last few days has &quot;been ordered by the *7ar Cabinet to place 5,000 men a week for 10 weeks permanently at the disposal of the Pood Product!oh Department of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. .    .       AS a result of the frequent combings over to which ine Army Council have subjected tho Army, comparatively few skilled or part skilled men remain in the Army except in positions in which their technical skill is being utilized. Of the few who do remain the vast majority, have been retained because.they are Warrant or Senior Uon-Commissioned Offioers of proved powers of leadership who are unwilling to be employed at their trade because they are seeking promotion to commissioned rank in the arm in which they are now serving.       6.    If the withdrawal from the Army of skilled men continues,  the result will be either to ronder.it impossible. for the Army Council to place in the Field all the batteries of Artillery whose manufacture has been approved by the War Cabinet and undertaken by the Ministry of Munitions,  or else the object sought by the release of such men from the Army will be defeated through the need of frequently returning the guns for repair to the woikshops in this country.   It may be that such repairs would not be, carried out by the Identical individuals who now carry out,,the  work as soldiers,  but the nett result  of such an arrangement would be to  increase the demand on  cross channsl tonnage without in any way increasing the total number of men with the requisite class of skill, available  to perform the work required in the gui/shops,  engin- eering establishments  and shipyards  w/hioh servo  the Navy and Army,       Further,  I  am to  ask you to  inform the lords  Commissioners that for the past  few motnhs, two  of the best Dilution Officers of  the Ministry of Munitions  have been  on  duty with the Armies  in.France  investigating the  labour conditions in the repair workshops  at  the  Bases  and  on the line a of Communica- tion in that, country with  the purpose  of  securing that there shall  be no wasto  of skilled  labour  in  those  establishments. Their  final report has not been awaited, and action has  been  /- taken  upon their recommondations, as  and when received.       The Army  Council have been informed by the Adjutant General of the Armies in France that the saving in personnel of  skilled grades which he has been able to  effect as a  result of  these recommendations has been disappointingly small.   .  &apos; Further &apos;I am to say that the Army Council will, in the future as in the past, continue to do  their utmost to secure the return to the Shipyards of all men who can be spared with- out detriment, to the fighting efficiency of  the foroes for which  they are responsible.      .They desire me, however, to say that they consider it very improbable that even if they were instructed by the Tar cabinet to release all soldiers with civil experience in shipyards and marine. engineering shops, It would be found that there were now in the whole of the; Military Forces of tho ^rown, 112,000 men who could legitimatelybe described as possessing experience of Shipyard and Marine Engineering vwrk.       a ?rge ntimbei&apos;S of men from Clydeside and Tyneside who eniisted^m 1914, many have become  casualties.-   The units ofl** Ppsm^l&amp;^JkmiLevs and Highland1 light: Infantry  in emJS        men: were largely incorporatedhave&quot;linf ortunately suffered severe casualties in action. :
