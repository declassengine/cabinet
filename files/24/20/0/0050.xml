The Cabinet requested Mr.Pretyman to examine a proposalmade by Messrs, S.Pearson Sons &amp; Co., that the Government shouldadvanoe a large sum of money on the security of their MexicanOil properties as an alternative to their transfer to SheStandard Oil Trust of U.S.America.       Mr.Pretyman has bestowed.much labour upon his taskand finally submitted a scheme to the Chancellor of theExchequer who has replied that he is not prepared to submitthe proposal to Parliament.   I ooncur In hie views.  Thequestion for the Cabinet to decide is whether Mr.Pretyman shouldinform Lord Cowdray that the Government are not prepared toenter into any agreement for purchase, and whether he shouldadd that the Government could not sanction, during the war, anytransfer to a Company formed outside of the Empire.      I do not desire to express any opinion on this point,and I cannot afford the Cabinet any further information, butI am advised that if Messrs. Pearsons are allowed to sell tothe U.8.A.i there will be oonsiderable indignation in thiscountry.   Lord Cowdray should be given a definite answerwithout further delay,(Intd)    W.H.I.1.8th July 191?.
