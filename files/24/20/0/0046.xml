    LASOUR DISPUTES.ent by Sir George Askwitli.      The  view held by  this Department  is  that  all  labour. disputes  arising in ail industries  should be dealt with by  one authority.  Any  other  methodand certainly the method  which is at present be ing advocat ed and - followed, of each Department handling  its own labour disputes., leads to inequalities, confusion and delay; Employers,  Workmen and the  Government Departments have no clear knowledge which authority is responsible  for  dealing with many of the disputes.  While each Department  pursues a policy distinct  and frequently antagonistic to the others,  there is lack of co-ordination and the consequence is general unrest. - If this policy is right with respect to Munitions, Shipping, Shipyard  Labour,  and Railways^ it cannot  of-course be logically opposed with respect to Mines.  In any case the line taken  of making the Goal  Controller^ Advisory Committee parties in  the discussion makes.it almost impossible  for anvone else to handle Mining d isputes  with success.  I mav submit that the quest ion might have been  better settled by the Government without support being obtained,  either  way, from interested parties.  It is obvious that a Committee composed of members of any of  the industries would  seek to control the disputes which arise in that industry when the financial consequences  of what is done largely fall upon.the Government.  We have seen numerous instances,  - since the. War began,,of Shipping,  Steel, and other Employers anxiously agreeing with  the workpeople against the views of the Government, simply because the financial consequences would not;fall upon themselves.;...:;      No matter how well defined an industry may be, the need for co-ordination and a uniform policy is essential,  as any action taken by  any Government Department in dealing with one
    trade respecting wages has  an immediate  and direct  effect upon    others.   One  of the  main causes  of  the  trouble with  the    Lancashire Tramway men is the  difference in treatment  as  b etwe en    them and the Railway  men..  Many  other instances  in all trades    will arise in  the  minds of  those  who have given consideration    to  the  matter..              I may  further submit that &quot;the  Coal Controller,  like  the    -Minister of Munitions, the Minister of Shipping and the otherj. ^controllers has, as I understand, been appointed  for the  purpose    of  organising  Production, distribution etc.   To  achieve  these    objects the utmost harmony Should be maintained:between members    who  are employers and those who are associated With the workmen    and who jointly are acting as an Advisory Committee to the    Controller.   There is, however,., no question which  is more likely    to  destroy this harmony than the handling of labour disputes by the    Controller and his advisers.    If conscious or unconscious    collusion, favourable to  themselves and against the interests of    the State, is avoided;  no matter how desirous they may be to    work harmoniously together for the purpose of increasing and    facilitating output and production they will be driven, by the    consideration of labour disputes,  into hostile camps,&apos; and even in    the event of their being individuaHy strong and patriotic enough    to make  the question of production predominant,  and although    determined not to allow labour differences to interfere with    production, the circumstances are, as we know from experience, likely    to prove to be too strong for them,  and the tendency which lias become .   evident  in certain mining districts, of the policy being dicta ted    from  the mine by-the/workers; as-partisans, and not from the Conference    room by the 1eaders as Advisors,  will become a danger.              I can only repeat,  therefore that my general  opinion is    that  not only the Coal Controller, but all Controllers and Ministers, i)  whose primary work is to facilitate production should not  interfere                                  (a)
 in labour disputes,   At  the same time,  I recognise that officers  charged with such responsible duties must be kept in close touch with all matters relating to the work that they hare been entrusted with, and while advocating that the Minister of Labour should be responsible for                     labour dispuTes&quot;,&quot;!&quot; admit&quot;&quot;that it might be advisable that other Departments should at the same time have a close connection with the Ministry,  This result might be effected if officers of otherDepartments were available to attend as representatives at.0onciliation meetings,  and important arbitrations,  and even if they desire, at small arbitrations.   This plan has  been pursuedwith success in the case of such bodies as the Royal Commission on Sugar, in several very large cases where  the Admiralty were concerned, in Wool?dch  and Snfield  cases by the V/ar Department,  and in many cases concerning the  High Ixplosives Department.                                      G.R.A.                                          9/7/17.m
