No. 1249.



Last night an armed demonstration against the Provisional Government was held. The following units joined in succession:- 1st Machine Gun Regiment, Grenadier (a), Moscow, Paul and 3rd Rifle Depot Battalions, 180th and 1st Depot Regiments and 6th Engineers Battalion. The demonstration accompanied by parties of armed workmen marched to the Duma and along the Nevski. Firing took place but chiefly in the air. Private automobiles were commandeered and mounted with Machine Guns and parties of armed workmen and soldiers are still driving about the town in the usual theatrical manner. About 25,000 men took part in the demonstration but most of the units of the garrison obeyed the orders of the Council and remained in barracks. The first idea was to arrest the Ministers but this was not carried out. The 2 Cossacks Regiments were called out by the District Staff and are now in the courtyards of the Anichkov and Winter Palaces. 6,000 men from Kronstadt have now arrived by river bringing barbed wire with them.

As long as the demonstrators keep without bounds authorities do not propose to interfere actively. The most serious point about the present unrest is that the demonstrators are disavowed by all political parties. Kerenski, who left for the front last night, has been recalled.

(a) The Grenadier, Moscow and Paul are Depot Battalions of the Guards.
