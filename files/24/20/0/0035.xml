i^TO&amp;^ts o*&quot; oil. m ;ANt) ships in u.s,a.        it is understood that it has he mi decided that anInter-Allied Council  should he appointed in London-to arrangethe quantities of  supplies of all kinds to be obtained fronthe U.S,A. by the  European Allies^. It is considered for thereasons shown below that Oil Wei and Ships should not conewithin its purview,OILS.         The following figures giving the requirements of OilFuel would seen to speak for themselves;-Admiralty-Trench f&amp;vyItalian NavyU.S,A.NavyPotal r equir ements, Tons per annum.4,000,000   90,000   120,000  ...   750^000Total purchases  inU&quot;,S.A.  Tons per Annum.     800.000 t      20,000 (1)      40*000 y v     750,&apos;000 (o)18All supplied by the Admiralty,80*000 tons now supplied by Admiralty which will, it is expected, shortly provide the balance of 40,000 tons from B-stem sources.   In addition  to above figure there are certain requirements for Italian Munition factories.Estimate only - no enquiry has been made of U,StA. C-overnment. o00-,000 tons used by U,S .A t destroye? in British waters.         It will be seen that  the Admiralty already suppliesFrance with the whole of her supplies  of Oil Fuel and Italy witha large proportion so that the co-ordination, which the Inxer-Al-lied Council is being formed to obtain, is already secured inthis connection.       In addition -Mr. Long the Secretary cfState for the Colonies acts as the co-ordinating authority forall petroleum, products in the  U.K. and decides questions ofpriority of tonnage requirements.      It is most desirable thatthese arrangements         &apos; * - should not be disturbed.         The collation and scrutiny of Oil fuel requirements byan Inter-Allied Council in London would be of no benefitwhatever to the Allies but would be a superfluity, this vrcrkbeing already done by the Admiralty v;hose requirements socomplet ely ov er s hade w those of  the c ther Kur opeanAllies,If/
     If Oil ?uel is to come within the purview of the Inter-Allied Council in London, then the responsibility for thesupply of one of the largest and most vital requirements of theNavy will pass from the Admiralty to a Councilwhieh includesrepresentatives from the other &quot;&quot;uropean Allies whose interestin the matter is trifling compared with that of the Admiralty.The Council will be fully occupied with the immense amount andvariety of other materials which it will control; its actionsmust necessarily be alow: and its decisions may be blocked orat any rate delayed.  by/She members of the Counci 1 whorepresent infinitesimal requirements in comparison with thoseof the British Havy.     As regards the actual purchases, which have been hithertonegotiated&quot;direct by the  Admiralty with the producers, theUnited States has proposed the appointment of a joint Boardin America to deal with this matter.   When this Board hasbeen formed and has -got to work, the Admiralty is fullyprepared to leave purchases in its hands, subject to adequatecontrol of prices.    It has been suggested that the purchasesshould be arranged between U.S.A. and British representativesonly.SHIPS,  V      / Similar considerations make it desirable that theAdmiralty should  retain resoonsibility for putting forward tothe U.S.A. Government the requirements for ships of all kindsfor this country, as  the needs of Great Britain far exceedthose of the other Allies.     In view of the fact that the United States Governmentwill probably in future control our purchases in that countryand will possibly annex the vessels already ordered,  it isthought to be necessary that the Admiralty should have a freehand in dealing with.t&amp;e American Government, and should nothave to go through the Inter-Allied Counci 1 in London.         It is therefore submitted that the War Cabinet shouldbe pressed to exclude Oil 5uel of all kinds and Ships of allkinds from the list of War materials from the U.S.A.  which willbe dealt with by the  Inter-Allied Council in London,  and toallow the Admiralty to retain its present responsibility forthe provision of Oil Fuel and Ships from that country.(Intlld)  E.C.G.
