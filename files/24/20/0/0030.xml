SECRET                     -I7AR  CABINET             PUTURE- STATUS Off  TEE MERCANTILE  MARINE(Copy of letter  from Mr.E.S.Montagu to  the  Secretary, war.Cattne                                      RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE,                                            6a,  DoanTs  Yard,  .                                              &apos;7e stmins ter, S, v&apos;./l                                            16th  July, 1917 Sir,       I &quot;beg to  acknowledge the receipt of the War  Cabinet Paper  G,T,I407, in whichthe Shipping Controller asks  for authorisation to give an assurance on behalf of tho Government that it is not intended that:Shipping should he nationalised after the war.       He forwards a letter from lord Inchcape, -  in which the following points occur :-      1.   Lord. Inchcape asks that there should he&apos; &quot;no           attempt to deprive us of our business.&quot;. ;:       2.  &quot;He implies that there should he no Government           ships competing with private-owned ships after           the war.       3*   He further suggests that &quot;our business&quot; should be           &quot;restored to us at the ond of the war.&quot;;.      I desire at once,  for I received the papers only to-day, to 8ay most emphatically that it is in my opinion quite impossible to contemplate the abolition of shipping control at the end of the war, and that therefore this third suggestion ought not for one moment to be considered.      Secondly,  I would observe that very many people - do contemplate some form of nationalisation, and at least some suggestions have reached mo for the maintenance  of Government ships.   I cannot but think that it would be a great mistake&apos; to commit  tho  Government to dismissing all such  suggestions without further  consideration,  and I cannot  but  think  that the Shipping Owners  are  not entitled to any declaration whichwill mean  that whatever  happens to other trades  and other industries,  they,  and they  alone,  are to be  assured now ofperfect immunity from oonsiaoration of snch  proposals.                              Yours faithfully,(Sgd.)  Ed.S. MONTAGU.
