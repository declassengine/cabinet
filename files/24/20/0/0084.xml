.G.T i 1482.WAR CABINET.TKB BETACBGiSNT, QE GE^AHg^ ALLIES.(i). Copy of letter from Mr.  Noel Buxton,  M.P.(ii) Notes on (i)  by Captain L.  S.  Amery,  11 .P.(i)Copy of a letter from Mr. Noel Buxton,  M.P.t      Since the Secret Session and the declaration of. Mr.  BonarLaw in the House of Commons on May 14th that &quot;no blow would seemgo fatal to the Germans as the detachment of one of their  Allies&quot;,the question whether the Entente Powers have an essential  quarrelwith Austria, Bulgaria and Turkey has been much debated.  Discussionhas been encouraged by the Russian demand for a revision of theAllies&apos; aims, and by the knowledge that sections of Russianopinion now in authority hold that the Allies ought to have recog-nised the Bulgarian claims.      The attitude of the Government ia viewed as a highly importantstep towards defeating Germany^ aims,, whether by actual detach-ment of her Allies, or by bringing pressure from them to bear onthe Berlin Government towards moderation.  It is regarded  also inthe light of the future as being in harmony with a settlementwhich aims at being decisive... : It is assumed that Turkey cannotbreak loose from Germany independently,  but that either Turkey andBulgaria, or Bulgaria and Austria could act together,  and&apos;thatHis Majesty&apos;s&apos;Government has in view the latter combination.      If this is so, the problem is to harmonise aims which apparent-ly conflict, namely;the satisfaction of Austria.and Bulgaria withthe Defeat of aggression, and the discharge of the duty of theAllies to Serbia, Italy, Roumahia and Greece.         /      The irreducible conditions on each side come very near tobeing imcompatible, but a solution may be found on the followinglines:-      The recognition of the Austro-Hungarian frontier,  except asto the Trentino, the claims of the nationalities in the Empirebeing met by internal reforms..  The restoration of Serbia,  andthe incorporation by her of Montenegro,  the port of Antivari beingmade a genuine economic outlet by the purchase of Spizza fromAustria.  The recognition of Bulgarians claims;, to her formerfrontiers, and, in addition, to the ao called TJncontested  Zone,  tothe Bulgarian parts of the recent Greek acquisitions in Macedoniaand to the part of the Dobrudja held by her in 19.12.  Bulgaria toabandon her present occupation of the contested zone and of everypart of the Kingdom of Serbia.      Safconica to be internationalised.      Rumania to  be  restored and  the.rights of the Rumans. in.Hungaryto be met by autonomy  for Transylvania.
     The arguments used in the controversy may be summarisedas follows.-(1)  The proposal is a practical one *     Tho probability of its success in one form or the other     is sufficient to outweigh the  possible;risks to  be adduced     against it.     There are many signs of a change  of fooling both in Austria     and Bulgaria.  For instance, American officials  who have     lately returned report the prevalence o  great hostility     to Germany in both countries,  and there is no need to     ernamerate the various difficulties in which the  Austrian......and Hungarian Governments find themselves involved.  It is     evident that Austria^/onld dosire peace if she were able     to preserve her frontiers (except as regards the Irefctino),     whothor the condition of peace were her Adoption of. a     federal system or not.  As to  Bulgaria,-the fact that Russia     Ceased for a time to be * a military power has not prevented     the Bulgarian Government&quot;from  facing the disapproval of     Germany.   This is conspicuously  shown in its refusal to   .:;.v:;;     break off relations with America.  The participation of thd;     United States in the war is certainly a factor in the change     of attitude, for Bulgarians regard that country as their     educational creator,  Again,  the  Russophil party in     Bulgaria has organised itself  in  the form of a nominally     cultural society.  The Russian Revolution oomplotely\     ohangos the Bulgarian attitude to Russia in many ways,     especially since the abandonment  by Russia of the policy of     annexing the Straits.  Its effect was seen in the serious     anti-&amp;erman disturbances in Sofia in April.(2)  The military advantage is evident.     If actual^detachment is achieved, its advantages are obvious.     Germany1? main object in the war, the possession of a corridor &apos;     to the East, would be thwarted arid Turkey would be paralysed,&quot;     The Entente would reap immediate  benefits;  our  forces at     Salonica would cease the offensive and the pressure of the     submarine campaign in regard -te tpaneport and tonnage would     be enormously lessened.     If detachment ie not achieved, an advantage arises in the     pressure put upon Germany by her  Allies to reduce her claims     in; the direction of the terras  which the Entente  desires.     It is urged on the contrary;-(1)  That supposing a detachment actually took place, Germany     would obtain increased supplies through the presence of     neutral countries on her flank.   -     ?hip, it must be assumed, is a factor which would b* dealt     with in any arrangement made.     That Bulgaria would evidently  be unwilling to ^oin Austria^     in defecting from Germany, because she would lose large     territories which she now holds.     In reply to this it may be pointed out that she  only holds     them at the price of keeping her peasants from their farms..     She has no security for doing so  permanently.  She 3ees that     she may lose still more territory.  The populations would
  ft    be difficult to  govern,  and  independenca.:&apos; oiv&amp;ooa SenniT^ih   i    the Allied Powers  is more  attractive  than material prc^pexity^    as a German  gangway without  real political  freedom.(3) That there is a  risk of  alienating  the  small  States.    To estimate  justly the balance  of risks requires a full  know-    ledge of official  information,  but  it may be  observed that the   . rtske of not adopting the  policy suggested  are  also very great..;.    provided that the  Allies adhere to - the:policy of restoration,   /there in no  equally attractive  prospect that  the Central Powers    can hold out.(4) That Bulgaria was  &quot;treacherous&quot;; and would be  untrustworthy as a :. ;neutrai. ....                    &apos;;   .m must remark that /Bulgaria was led  to distrust the  Entente at,    the beginning of the -war.^  Allied diplomacy wavered between.    two rival policies and refused  to recognise the importance of    Bulgaria as  a factor in  the  military  situation.  The  strong  pro-    Ally party in Sofia received no encouragement;  moreover,  it  had    to contend with  the overshadowing menace of: Russian Imperialism-.    Today the aspect has changed.   The  new  Russia has repudiated all    ideas;of conquest  and has  thus  re-assured the Bulgarians. They    were mainly  Ruseophil even before the Russian Revolution; while    friendship for democratic  Russia is universal.&apos;  It led to. dia-    turbanoes even before the  friends of  thfc Entente were able to    show that the Entente was  prepared^, to- recognise Bulgarian rights,(5) That Serbia  would  be.unjustly treated.   *    In reality the policy of detachment offers  the  only means of    promoting Serbia&apos;s.national  aspirations. If  satisfaction had    been given to.the  legitimate national claims/of Bulgaria at    the beginning&apos; of the war,  the disaster  in the Balkans would  have    been averted.1 The only  way  to  secure: peace there in  the future    is to recognise  local desires and;to  frame  a  settlement  on.that    basis.            /*;,;.;-; *&apos;*/.-.                      ;--;:-/-    It may also  be; pointed out that it  u&amp;s  Russia,  whof as  the  -  traditional  champion of  the  Slav cause, first took up arms^fcn.   .the war for  Serbian independence; and that  ve cannot  go  beyond    Russia in active support of  the irredentist ambitions of our    Balkan Allies.  Serbia would be adequately  rewarded for  the  loss    of the Uncontested Zone  in Macedonia  (without which Bulgaria    trill certainly not be tempted to abandon the  war) by  the achieve^    ment of union with Montenegro and hy  the acquisition  through this    means of access  to the sea.  It is  evident  that the restoration 9$-    Se rbi a ,6annot,be adequate  on less favourable  terms.   unle-s a  the    former ideal of  Serbophilt. be adopted,  namely the Unification of    the whole Serbo  Croat race as one of.the component parts of    Austria Hungary, the basis suggested  is the only one  on  which an    arrangement  is possible.  It is sometimes urged that  an  Adjustment    with Bulgaria is impossible  without taking  large territories:frod    Austria for  the  enlargement  of  Serbia,  but  while the  restoration    of Serbia and the  grant  of genuine  freedom  to the Treritino are    essential,, the extension ofSerbia  to include the Croats of  Austria    Hungary, and of  Itily to include Dalmatia,  are  notfrequi sites of    a good settlement. They -are alsa incompatible  with one  another.    The compensation of Serbia for  the  loss of  Monastir by union with    Montenegro would not only  provide Serbia;; with access  to  the  sea,1  .  but would lead to  stability  in  the  future,  This arrangement    *ould represent  a  substantial nett  gain to  Serbia and an appro-    priate compensation for  her  sacrifices  in the war.
Similar considerations apply to Greece and Rumania..  It isimpossible that the small States should gain all that they wouldhave;secured if they had not,  by their refusal to make the con-cessions required by the Allies in 1915,  made our victoryimmensely more difficult.        ...       .That a Federal Austria might remain; pro-German.On the other hand, the question whether a series of smallindependent States would be any greater barrier to German domina-tion is problematical.That the German &quot;corridor&quot; would be inadequately severed bythe restoration of Serbia and Rumania..:;.vTo this it may be replied that even if these States weregreatly enlarged, thay would form an adequate military barrieronly so far as they are strengthened by the forces of the GreatPower8 hostileto Germany.;It may be thought desirable,  even if the suggestions to bemade are not yet agreed upon between the Entente Powers,  toencourage the allies of Germany to put forward their ideas ofpossible terms of agreement.   On the question of procedurefor this purpose it is well to remember the comparatively goodfeeling which exists between Austrian diplomacy and that ofAmerica, and the continuance of friendly relations,  bothofficial and unofficial, between America and Bulgaria.(3d.)  NOEL BUXTON.
NOTES&quot; OK MR, flQSL BUXTOH&apos;S LBgTBH BY CAPTAIN LoS,AM.3RY, M.P.     In his letter Mr.  BuXtoh proposes, a.scheme for detachingAustria and-Bulgaria simultaneously,  the main, features of which are(1) that Austria-Hungary should retain the whole of her territoryexcept the Trentino, undertaking to meet the claims of the Nationalsities in the Empire, by internal reform;  (2) that Bulgaria shouldgive- up her present conquests from Serbia and Roumsnia, except theold uncontested zone in Southern Macedonia and her pre-1912 share ofthe Dobrudja, tout should receive in return the whole of GreekMacedonia both East and /Jest of Salonika, Salonika itself being madea free port;  (3) that  Serbia and Roilmania be permitted to keep thaiformer territoriesj subject to-the&apos;deductions aforesaid, but thatSerbia should be allowed to annexe Montenegro and so secure an acccsto the.sea (in theory;   in practice such-an outlet, over the mountainto a -strip of coast without a port is quite Valueless)..-     Mr. BuxtonVs letter contains no recognition Of. the immensedifficulties, of&apos;every kind which attend the making of a separatepeace by a member of/either side under present conditions.  Belgium,S erbia,  Roumania have all suffered far more &apos; than&apos;Austria andBulgaria,  In each of these States dissatisfaction with their Alliesis strong and the hope  of success uncertain&apos;...  in each of-them alarge party iSj at heart, convinced that the Government took thewrong course in entering the war On the Allied side,  Serbia andRoumania could easily secure, if they have not already been offered,terms for a separate peace at least as favourable as those which&quot;Mr. Buxton proposes to allot to them.  And yet, for. all that,detaching themselves from the innumerable complex bonds, of theAlliance they have taken up is not a practical question.     The most striking instance, after all, is that o-f Russia.The Russian people are almost solid in wishing -for peace at theearliest moment.  They have no objective which they now wish forthat Germany would not concede to them to-morrow.  By their, geo-graphical position they are completely free, from any sort ofentanglement with the rest of the Allied forces.  Financially theadvantage&apos;of, repudiating the whole of the immense debt to theAllies which was incurred by the old regime would be enormous.And yet from a sense of loyalty and sheer momentum they are goingon, and may go on for a long time, even if they do not&apos; revert totheir old ideas and ambitions,     In the case of the Central Powers the Inherent difficultiesin the way of a separate peace are infinitely greater, than with theEntente.  They occupy a solid block Of territory, with a singlesystem. of railway communication.:. That system is &quot;largely in Germanhands,  Along.the whole&apos; Southern and Eastern front from Monastirto Galatz, andGalatz to.Pinsk4.their armies are inextricablyintermingled.  Last autumn? /vtfnwSitensen ^as. in control of thegeneral strategy both of&apos;the Austro-German-?Vulgar-Turkish forcein Roumahia and of the force, in Macedonia... This latter wasdirectly under Bulgarian General Headquarters, but included theGerman Eleventh Army, which, however, was largely composed ofBulgarian troops, and a Turkish division  In Serbia^ Rumania,Poland thero is a joint occupation and administration whichincreases still further,the practical difficulties in the way ofdisentanglement.  A Provisional Government in Birmingham wouldfind it almost as easy a- task to disentangle the Midlands from thewar, es Austria would find it to carry a separate peace intoeffect.          -         :.&apos;--:.-&apos; :
      But  apart from  the practical  difficulties  of disentangle- aient  there  are permanent motives of  racial.sympathy  and. political interest which give -the  Central Alliance a: cohesive  . . force intrinsically  greater-than that  possessed by the: Entente. If the Austrian  Government would and could  desert its  Ally there ero&quot; in Austria1ten million Germans who would  refuse  to follow, - and those ten millions include  a substantial  maj or ity of the higher bureaucracy and General  Staff-  &apos; A separate peace for         , Austria means, in fact, civil war  and&apos; suicide.      In Hungary&apos; ten  million Magyars  have - preserved thoir power  . over! Slays  and Roumanians by co-operation with  the Germans in Austria..&apos; The maintenance of the German domination in Austria is a vital thing, to them.  A separate peace which  would involve the end of-that dominationwould inevitably  endanger  their position. A peace on the lines sketched by Mr. Buxton, which  would  impair the unity  of the Hungarian Kingdom for the benefit  of Czecho-Slovak, Jugoslav or Rumanian  autonomy is one to which&apos;  they would  never dream of agreeing at any rate not  till the Allied armies have reached  Budapest.     - The  same common interest in the suppression  of  Jugoslav and Rumanian  aspirations links Bulgaria  to Hungary  and so to ,the Germans in Austria  and Germany.  V/e are dealing, , in fact, with a Germsn- Magyar-Bulgar racial:combination against Czeeho-Slovaks, Jugoslavs and Rumanians, which is kept together  b$r the  strongest of ties, that of self-preservation.  Sentimental&apos;Bulgarophils like Mr. Buxton misled the  Entente Governments  in  1915. into imagining-that. Bulgaria could be  won to  our  side by giving her concessions in Macedonia. They would  not face  the fact that  the  victory of  the Entente as such was contrary to  Bulgarian interests  because it  involved the aggrandiser - ment both of Serbia  and Rumania, and therefore  placed a permanent barrier to  Bulgarian expansion  and definitely reduced Bulgaria to  the position  of the  smallest of the Balkan powers,   -.  Last&apos;t  but not least, - -from  the economic point of view, - the maintenance of the Central Alliance, including  Turkey,  holds out, for both  Austria and Bulgaria,  a far more promising,  prospect than anything; they, can hope to gain  if  they make a separate  peace and Germany is  crushed*-   It means for  Austria the opening up by German capital and enterprise of a great  market in the Near East,  in which Austria,  with her cheaper labour and more favourable geographical.position, can hope to command an ever-increasing proportion.  It means for Bulgaria that she will be  placed  in the very centre.and midstream of one of  the worlds greatest arteries of production and exchange, instead of remaining, as she otherwise would,  in a compare- tiVe backwater.      There  is this to be said for  the  particular proposals  set forth by Mr. Buxton  that, barring  the  internal  reconstruction of Austria-Hungary,  which could always  bo promised:and  not  carried out, they  are  far more likely to be  acceptable to  the Powers concerned than  any  which have  yet been suggested in any-quarter.   Austria gives up  no more than she actually offered  Italy, before  the latter joined the  war;   Bulgaria is compensated for  the abandonment  of part  of her conquests in the Dobrudja  and Serbia by  the  whole of Greek Macedonia,  with the practical  control of  Salonika, and  by the assuranoe that both  Serbia and  Rumania will be  left  reduced in territory,  crippled  and impotent.
       But this  aspect of&quot;Mr.Buxton&apos;s  proposals  must also  be  regarded ^ rom  the  point of view of their effect upon our Allies.-  We shouXoTobTiously  lose the  services  of the Serbian,  Rumanian,  Greek and Italian  armies.-  All these  Powers would regard them-  selves as betrayed.    Serbia  and Rumania would become  mere - enclaves in  the Auetro-Bulgar group,: end in  so far as  they looked  to support outside would look to  Germany.    Italy  would  hot only  renew her relations with Germany but  would  in all probability  turn round and demand  from us as  the reward  for her efforts and  sacrifices some substantial compensation, such,- for instance,,  as Corsica and Tunis,  and back  up her  demand-by threatening to  attack France, in roar.    The  only motive tlia;b  keeps Russia in  the  field, namely  loyalty to  the: Allies - at large,.and  to  their  Serb kindred in particular,xwould;have lost  its meaning  after  such a display of  disloyalty  all round on our  pert,  and  a  separate  Russb-German  peace would probably follow.       Germany and Turkey would be left  alone  in the field.   But  they would be at no great disadvantage.   Even if  Austria and Bulgaria  are capable of:the disloyalty of making a separate peace,  there  is  no  reason for imagining that  they would adopt towards .  their  old Allies an attitide  of neutrality less favourable than  that shown by the  United States at the beginning of the war.. That is  to say they would  not interfere  with the export and  .  import of raw materials  or munitions of  war.    German  officers would  have to wear mufti  on the  journey  to Constantinople.  German artillery on its  way to  Turkey might  nominally  have  to &quot;be.the  subject of  a commercial  transaction between two private firms. - Meanxvhile fruit  end sulphur  from Italy,  and wheat and petrol  from Southern Russia, would flow  freely  through neutral Austria to relieve the blockade of Germany.   The  drastic measures.-.&quot;, we enforco against the  smaller neutrals  could not be put  into effect  against Italy, Austrdh and Bulgaria,  without provoking a  threat  that they might take the field  again or at any rate retaliate  in other ways, e.g. in the case of Italy by  threaten- ing  to repudiate her debts.      The  truth is that the idea of securing  a separate peace  from any  one or more of the Enemy Powers by some  ingeniously framed offer  is  inherently absurd, and is so because it- ignores the essential  interests and principles which have created  the two Alliances.   To take a parallel from home politics:  the Unionists might as well have tried in 1911 to avert the Parliament Act by trying to detach the nationalists from their1 alliance by the promise of an alternatisollome Rule measure.. -      This does not meen  that a separate peace is absolutely impossible.   A separate peace,  though extremely difficult, might be attained by a concentration of military force by either  side upon one particular member of the opposing Alliance under conditions - which made it difficult for the rest  of its Allies  to render it assistance.   That was the principle  upon which the Austro-Germans .: concentrated on Russia in 1915.    They failed,  but  they can legit- imetely claim that the present situation with its possibilities of-separate peace is the outcome;of their effort.   That was also tlie principle underlying the Dardanelles Expedition, an enterprise - Perfectly sound in its conception which failed because of the
 inadequacy of the methods employed,  :At the present time it-is possible that if. we could overcome the-.submarine, difficulty suffi- ciently to enable us to. concentrate an effective superiority., against Turkey, the mo3t exhausted.and leasb-easily- reinforced member of the Enemy Alliance, -we might., secure - a sepavabe -peace, in that quarter, and might then endeavour to repeat .the performance with Bulgaria.           The question of separate or general peace, is at bottom one of strategy.   Our strategy hitherto has, on the whole; been based. on the idea of concentrating all our effort on breaking the resist-^&apos; ance of our strongest, opponent,: the German Army, knowing, that. if  - that Army once collapses the ethers will offer but little further resistance. -. That; strategy involves,,,  as. its:.political consequence, that as. long as the German Army is unbroken the German Alliance remains&apos; unbroken likewise.If we succeed in our military object our political,success, will be correspondingly complete.   If on. the other hand we fail on the Western Front, we shall get no more out of a general peace than general fatigue and exhaustion will dispose the enemy to concede.   :If that prospect is not sufficiently encour- - aging.; -if we consider &quot;it&quot;; essential, even at the: risk of; Central Europe - remaining intact,&apos; to make certain of detaching Turkey,  and if possible Bulgaria, :frqm.their Alliance&apos;,: then we.must modify our strategy, abandon or postpone&quot; our plans for&apos;victory in the West; and concentrate such military force in the East as will secure our immediate object.  &apos; -To. imagine that we can buy off Germany&apos;s Allies: without first-either beating chose Allies or beating Germany,  and- that it would pay us to do so on terms which would wreck our own Alliance,..&apos;is an amiable but most dangerous delusion. :(intd.)
