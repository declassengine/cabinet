SUMMARY OF BLOCKADE INTELLIGENCE.WSMiM^               July 15 - 19. 1917, ENEMY SUPPLIES,            It is clear that the principal crops over a large      part of Europe and the Americas will be moderate or worse.      For the Allies this fact creates two serious problems; the      problem of economically transporting cereals from more dis-      tant markets (India, Australia etc) and the problem of      establishing an efficient machinery for the co-ordination      of purchases and the regulation of prices.  For the      European neutrals the difficulty is to secure a portion of      the United States harvest, since little will be obtainable      from the Argentine and less from the British Empire,  For      Germany and Austria the all important problem is that of      collecting and distributing the crops of their own and the      occupied territories;  but their difficulty is that these      crops however economically handled,  can at best, only provide      famine rations for the ensuing twelve months.            The German and Austrian newspapers speak reassuringly      of the Boumanian harvest;   but we can hardly suppose that      Roumania has entirely escaped the unseasonable weather which      has been experienced by Hungary in the last sis months.  In      Hungary and Germany and Austria the  crops have been severely      damaged by the cold spring and subsequent drought.            Reports from Bohemia, Moravia, East Prussia and Centra^      Germany are uniformly of the same tenor;  cereals,  hay, clover      lucerne, fruit, potatoes are all disappointing.  Things are      better in West Germany;  but. a failure of the crops in East      Prussia, Posen and Silesia is a disaster for which good crops      in the West cannot compensate.  Next winter and spring there
       Will be more need than ever of Polish and Roumanian       cereals.  But already the  harvests of the occupied terri-       tory are being brought into consumption^   The  Tyrol is       living on Roumanian maise.  Germany must  import  600.000       tons of bread corn &quot;between now and August 16 unless she is       prepared to reduoe the bread-ration still further.   The       next eight weeks will he  a critical period for the  Central       Empires;  but the food question will he even more  acute in       the spring of 1918.             The Geiman Government are making every effort to       import foodstuffs from foreign count ries.   They  have pre sent f       ed to Denmark an imperious demand for larger supplies of       animal fats*  Ihey have offered, without  success,  the most       alluring terms for a farther loan of fifteen million guilder^       in Holland, to he sgent on Dutch agricultural  produce;  and       it Is expected that, notwithstanding the  recent  drop in the       reserve of the Reiehshank, another twenty million marks in   ;    gold will shortly be remitted from Berlin to Holland.  They       are pressing for a further extension of the Economic Agree-       ment with Switzerland, although incredible efforts  will he       necessary to supply the quantities of coal which the Federa-       tion will demand.  The German Purchasing  Committee  at Con-.       stantinople is despatching Turkish produce to  Germany at the       rate of 300 tons a day, although prices in the Ottoman       Empire have risen to preposterous levels.ALLIED &amp; MUTRAL SUPPLIES.             There is a food crisis  in Greece which will he       prolongs d for some weeks by the disorganlsation  of  the       moans of transport and distribution.   The  shortage  is       heing relieved by importatione  of grain and rice from India       and Egypt.   But the French military authorities  claim 15,000       tons of the Thessalian wheat  harvest,  and  it is  imperative
that Greece should receive an equivalent in imported wheat.The Greek railway services will soon collapse unless we cansupply t hem with e o al and mate ri al s.      So far as can &quot;be seen at present the Danish crops ofcereals, potatoes * &quot;beetroot and hay are &quot;below the average.A shortage of fodder is imminent and farmers have begun tosell off their cattle;  there is some reason to suspect thatexports of cattle are increasing beyond the official limit of6,000 head a week;  There is no likelihood that Denmark willbe able to export cereals to Germany.  The forecasts fromSweden are not so detailed, as those from Denmark.  But theSwedish hay harvest has turned out badly;  wholesale slaughterings of cattle are expected in consequence of the shortageof fodder;  and the Cabinet and country have shown extremenervousness respecting the new Amezican Exports Proclamation.Exports of food to Germany have practically ceased.  On theother hand, it has become impossible for us to obtain transitfacilities for foodstuffs going to Russia unless we authorisethe import-ation of similar supplies for Swedish consumption.       Although the Dutch Government make light of the recentpotato riots there is no doubt that a real shortage of foodexists in the large centres of population.  Exports of agri-cultural produce to Germany are unabated in volume, becauseDutch industry would come to a standstill without German coaliron and steel.  But it is proving difficult to convince thelower classes that these exports are for their benefit.                     .  -  &apos;       - U                      v:/   .L      The food crisis in Portugal is still acute and the Port^igese Government have applied to the United States for licencesto export American wheat.      Though the Exports Proclamation should somewhat dimin-ish the Immediate demand in the United States wheat market,the Scandinavian countries and Holland are anxious to cover
 their requirements &quot;by American purchases at  the  first opportunity.   The Hoover Bill for regulating the wheat  market is likely to  be  considerably delayed and modified  in Con- gress, and there will probably be a  period of uncontrolled buying in August.  Mr. Hoover is  anxious that we should buy as much as possible in Canada during the summer  and autumn and as little as possible in America,  He has discussed the situation with the Canadian Authorities, and they  are pre- pared to work with him.       In the  forthcoming year  it  will be necessary for  Egypt either to import considerable  quantities of  wheat  and flour, or to make a  considerable reduction  in the area  under cotton cultivation..        -            .           ^ - -..        ------.         -&apos;       The Swedish Press and (Government are expressing fears that England  and the United States mean  to compel  Sweden to abandon, her neutrality,   Mr, Henderson,  who  lately passed thiDugh Stockholm,  has explains d  to  Admiral  Idndman that  . this is a misconception of British policy.   The  United States Minister  is taking steps to enlighten the Swedish working classes  as to the true  object  of Mr.   Wilson1^ pro- clamation.       We have informed the  Swedish Government that,  if  they desire special facilities for  Swedish  shipping,  they should offer us a Shipping Agreement  of the same kind as  that which we have concluded with the  Danish shipowners.e       She Legislative Committee of the Storthing have unan- imous&amp;y adopted  a proposal  for maximum freights  in the lorwegian American trade  wbieb, as the Prime Minister explained to  them,  will not be  liable  to molestation by

There  Is  a possibility  that maximum       freights will also  be imposed on the North  Sea Trade;   but/       if such a scheme  is prepared,  we can easily insist that it       shall not apply to  coal oargoes going to Norway in British       ships under our Shipping Agreement.             The Norwegian Government are suddenly becoming zealous       for the strict execution of the new War Trade Law against the       fraudulent export of prohibited goods and goods imported       under guarantees.   For this sign of grsoe we may thank  Mr.       Wilson.GERMAN  SUBMARINE BLOCKADE. ; V             The f ollowing Is  a summary of the losses of merchant       shipping, due  to  enemy action, which were officially re-       ported in the  period July  13 - July 19 inclusive.
