S E C R iTJT^ &apos;                                  20-7-17.0.1/112/324.       IV        At the meeting of the War Cabinet on 17th July, 1917,i,C. 188/10.  : Vv::^;.              &apos;            it was decided that the question of the Channel Tunnel should i;            be referred to the Naval and Military authorities.                 This question v/as referred to the \*ar Office last 79/9293. - &apos; ..            September when the proposal to construct a Channel Tunnel  -            was revived by Mr. Arthur Fell, M.P., Chairman of the            House of Commons Channel Tunnel Committee.  The reply of the  i]            Army Council on that occasion was that the conclusions         :   reached by the General. Staff in May 1914, (which were            unfavourable to the scheme) &quot;cannot be suitably reviewed            until they are informed as to what is to be the military            policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government after the war&quot;.  After            further careful consideration of the subject the General            Staff adhere to the View that it is impossible in present            circumstances to express an opinion on this proposal.       2.        It is evident that our military policy after the war            must depend on the general policy of His Majesty &apos;s Govern-            ment/ and that this again must depend on the nature of the            peace settlement, upon the political and military conditions            in Europe which will result from it, and upon the strength            of the British Army and Navy.  For instance, if the present            system of: alliances continues after the present war and if            Germany continues to threaten the balance of power in Europe,            railway communication with the Continent, as providing a            safer and more rapid route for the transport of troops and     I                     &apos;;&amp;-:r^ - &apos; &apos;                                  material   !I
material, might be of considerable military advantage;but the security of this line of communication woulddepend on many factors which it is impossible toforecast, such as the complete withdrawal of Germanyfrom Belgium, the strength and efficiency of the French,arid Belgian Armies, and the prospect of arresting aGerman offensive before it could reach the Channelports. On the other hand, if it seems probable thatnew combinations of Powers will result from the peacesettlement, arid that in a future war France may beneutral or even hostile, a Channel Tunnel might involvegrave:military disadvantages,     &apos; * f  - - - -. .               ......     Moreover, the question cannot be decided withoutreference to the size and organization of the BritishArmy in the future, on the degree of support which itwill be able to render to a Continental Ally, and onthe numbers which will be available for home defence.     It is unnecessary to point out that none of thesethings can be foreseen; it is impossible to say whatour relations with the various Continental Powers willbe, or what their and our military systems may be. Ina word the political and military conditions of thefuture are totally unknown.     In these circumstances any opinion on thedesirability or otherwise on military grounds of aChannel Tunnel could only be based on conjecture andwould be there fore ent ire ly val ue le s s
      From the terms of the question which the Chairmanof the House of Commons Channel Tunnel Committee hasaddressed, to the Prime Minister, it is gathered that thereis no suggestion that any work should &quot;be done, or anymoney spent, during the War and in view of this fact, andof the military aspect of the question, which has beendealt with above, it appears premature to attempt to cometo a decision at the present time.General Staff. *     War Office.20th July, 1917,
