122 Leadenhall Street,    London. B.C.3.        6th July, 1917.Lear Sir,     You aro asking thd Liners to do a good deal for theGovernment when you ask them to place their organisations atthe disposal of tho country.   The Lirers business, as youare aware, is a very important one, eratracing.as it doesgreat organisations and goodwill not only in this country butall over -the.-world.;&apos;-  These,-organisations have been.built upby years of strenuous work and application, often at greatsacrifice.:  The Liners have agreed amongst themselves thatin the diversion of their vessels fron trades in 7/hich they havebeen previously employed to other trades, advantage shall notbe taken to secure a footing in the latter.   None of ushesitate for a moment to accede to your request in the emergencywhich faces the country but in doing so we think we are notunreasonable if we ask for an assurance * that when the war isover there will bs no attempt to deprive us of our business.With this assurance you may rely on our working our ships forthe benefit of the Government and the country precisely in thesame way as if we were working them for ourselves, and we shallin that case enter upon your proposed arrangement in fullconfidence that our business will ba restored to us at the endof the War.     The withdrawal of our ships from distant internationaltrades is already opening the door to foreign competitors,who are making full use of the .opportun.ities, and we shall havegreat difficulty in re-establishing ourselves in many tradssfrom which our ships aro being withdrawn, but if in additionto this our own Government have any intention of competing withus by means of\Government ships, there will,so far as enter-prise is concerned be an end of the British Mercantile Marine.If there is any intention of this kind, which wo scarealy thinkthere;can be, we are of opinion it should be disclosed now.:     I have been asked by the Liners to place this note beforeyou.      1                     Yours faithfully,                            - .: (Signed)  IICHCAPE.The Right Hon&apos;ble  .       .   -    Sir Joseph Maclay,  Bart.,      ;&apos;&quot;:.-V;;- Controller of Shipping,                 St.  James1s Park,                  -  - S.1 *aCOPY.
