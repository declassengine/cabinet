Arrangements  are being made with the officials of theShipwrights Society to supply the Admiralty with 200 addition-al men urgently required for flying boat building.     Employers in the Iron Ore Industry are not desirous ofobtaining mining labour from outside sources and it is theopinion of the Labour Advisory Committee that unless strongmeasures are adopted by the Government there is little hopeof obtaining the increased production of iron ore said to benecessary in the interests of the Country.
 AGRICULTURAL SECTION.  \-; 1.    Military Labour on Farms for Hay Harvest.      (a)   England &amp; Wales.   The returns made by*t&amp;e..Agricultural - Commissioners of the National Service Department show that the numbers of men placed from this class of labour are: - :y              Promised    ....    12,275              Arrived     ....    12,113          -Sent out ;   ..,.     9,596      Reports show that with some few exceptions the labour placed is satisfactory.      (h)   Scotland.   The work of distribution of men on the land continues, and in the main it is  believed that the men&apos; will prove satisfactory. 2,    National Service Volunteers,    The number of Volunteers passed (to date) after interview for. Agriculture is 5,059, the number of Volunteers asked for is 1,680, and of these 628 have been placed, 5.    Part -Time Labour,: \-      (a)   Hay Harvest,   The completion of the special report on this, subject is still delayed by the  pressure of other work.      (b)   Corn Harvest;    Considerable difficulty has been exper- ienced in obtaining accurate information from the Food-Production Department as to the demands for;labour from Agricultural Execu- tive Committees.   The original demands of the Food Production Department were for &quot;civilian labour only but many of the detailed demands of the. Agricultural Committees call for soldiers or alternatively skilled civilians only.      It is imperative that farmers should realise that  it is impossible to meet the large demands  of labour for the  corn harvest with military labour or with  skilled civilians.    It is believed that unskilled civilian labour can be  used to  a large extent for this purpose*  and this; view is confirmed by  the fact that unskilled soldier labour is proving satisfactory when given a fair trial,      (o)   Timber,.  . The Commissioner  for Scotland reports that arrangements have been completed for  the employment of  600 boys
    from Secondary Schools upon timber work in Scotland.         (d)  Miners.   Arrangements with regard to the employment    of miners on harvest work have not yet been completed as the    Director of the Agricultural Section is awaiting the answer of    the Miners&apos; Federation to his proposal to explain this scheme to    the Annual Conference of the Federation to be held in Glasgow    next week.    -    School Boy,,. &amp; Professional&quot; Labour.   Three further camps for    these workers have been asked for: one at Beaulleu, one at Isle    of Wight, and one in SouthWales, and arrangements for these are    well in hand.   The Director-General has received great assis-    tance from the War Office Authorities in connection with the    camp arrangements,   During the week a Conference was, held of    the Officers from CT.C. contingents, who are to be in command    of the camps, and instructions to be issued were settled.    GENERAL TRADES SECTION.  X;    (a)  Trade Committees.   No further information is to hand    about the English Building Trades, but a start has been made    in obtaining Substitution Volunteers from the Scottish Building    Trades, 25 having been reported this week from the Edinburgh    district.   Forty-four Local Committees have now been set up in    the Printing Trades and 9 more&apos;are in process of formation; about    370 Volunteers have been obtained in the London area, and so far    about 94 in the  Provinces.   .         A Conference has been held with the representatives of the    employers in the  ?iane Trade, as a result of which an enquiry is    to be made in order to find out from each employer the number of    men available; the workpeople are also to be approached direct.
