ANDREW SQUARE,              EDINBURGH.                       \Wi July 1917.SIR,DEER  FOREST  GRAZINGS.    I am directed by the Board of Agriculture  for  Scotland to refer to  their  previous  Circular (No.  11117),  issued  on  19th December last, containing the  BoardV recommendations on the^subject  of  game  in relation  to agriculture&quot;-generally,  and  in particular to  the  appeal  made  to  the effect that  all owners of deer forests and  grouse moors should allow these  to be used so far as practicable for grazing  cattle or sheep.   The Board  desire further to refer to their later circular to deer forest proprietors of 26th  January, expressing  their satisfaction  at the  indications given in the replies to the previous  circular that proprietors as a rule  were prepared  to  stock  their  forests with sheep  or  cattle during the summer  grazing season, or to  allow farmers to take advantage of such grazings.      . -    Since the issue of these  circulars the Board have been engaged in making  a  survey of the different forests, and, in  view of the duties which have been imposed upon  them  by the Defence of $he Realm Regulations, desire  to  impress upon landowners the necessity, wherever possible, of granting  facilities  for grazing sheep as well as cattle in deer forest areas.  - &apos; Before taking  further steps in this direction under the powers conferred xipon them, the Board think&apos; that it will be a distinct advantage if they have before them, for communication to farmers desiring relief grazings, or willing to restock deer forests,  a definite statement from each&apos; proprietor.indicating exactly what  has been done during the present season,  and what he is prepared to do in addition.          .           .  ; &apos; - *    .          -   -  .    The Board would accordingly be  glad to be furnished with this information at the earliest possible date and, unless  there are special reasons for delay, within ten days  from  the  date of this letter.            ..  &quot; -      V  ;  .
