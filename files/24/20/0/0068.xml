CONFIDENTIAL.[33903]    I CIRCULATE to the Cabinet a letter, from the Home Office relative to the entryinto  this  country  of M.  Farbmann,  Petrograd correspondent of the  &quot;&quot;ManchesterGuardian,&quot; and. a reputed pacifist agent.    I would propose, if the Cabinet agree, to instruct Sir G. Buchanan  to reduce thefacilities accorded to doubtful persons  in Russia desiring  to enter this country to thesmallest possible number of cases.                                                                     A. J. B.    Foreign Office, July 10, 1917.                          Home Office to Foreign Office.(Confidential.)Sir,                                                   Whitehall&apos;, June 29, 1917.    With reference to the Foreign Office letter of the 19th instant forwarding copies-of telegram Ho. 904 from His Majestys Ambassador at Petrograd on the subject of thearrival in this country  of a  certain  M. Farbmann, the Petrograd correspondent  ofthe &quot; Manchester Guardian,&quot; I am directed  by the Secretary of State  to say, for theinformation of Mr. Secretary Balfour, that the man  arrived  shortly after the receipt ofSir George Buchanan&apos;s  telegram and is now in England.  He was searched on arrivalwith negative results.   Sir  George Cave  understands both from the Ambassadorstelegram and from information supplied to him by the  police that  Farbmann is likelyto carry on a mischievous agitation in pacifist and other circles, and in his opinion itwould  have been in the public interest to forbid his landing.  That course, however,could not be taken in view of the facilities granted to him  by Sir  George  Buchanan,and in  the circumstances it would presumably be equally difficult to remove him fromthe country by means of a deportation order.   It appears from Sir George Buchananstelegram that he is likely to receive further applications, which it; may be difficult torefuse, for facilities to go to England from persons the  object of whose journey is thesame as  that of M. Farbmann.   Sir George Cave  does  not know how far it  may bepossible to check the departure of such people from Russia,  but he wishes to point out.that if  they are provided with facilities by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador  they cannot beprevented from landing in this country, and that, once they are here, it  will be difficultlor, the police, to keep them under any sort  of. observation, and impossible to controltheir movements in any way..                                                     I;am, &amp;c.                                                          EDWARD TROUP.       -   -.&apos;.--&apos;-v&apos;::-             ... -  &apos; &apos;    &quot;&apos;&apos;                  .             .v&quot;.  &apos;  V: &apos;        .&apos;      .:  &apos; - &apos; -. - v-.&apos;.&apos;,- &apos;                            &quot; .        ------.-  -                           -          ;&quot; &apos;.[790]
