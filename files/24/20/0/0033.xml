llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllH          While fully appreciating the efforts which have beenmade to maintain the guns in France. I desire to urge theimportance of providing the Armies in Prance with the full numberof &amp;uns and howitzers required to complete and maintain establish-ments.          On this the M.G.O. reports          WI have little to add to the figures given by the PieldMarshal Commanding-in-Chief.          The Minister of Munitions is doing all he can to push onthe output of guns and I append figures showing what we promisedPrance on 11th June and what we actually sent to Prance during thatmonth.   I have added the figures promised to Prance for July andthose we have shipped up to date and also our promises for August.11/6/17Promise18-pr .4.5&quot; .60-pdr. 6&quot; Gun .6&quot;How.6&quot;How.9.2HHow. 12&quot;How.112   38   27482912Actuallyshipped dur-ing June,Prance werepromisedfor Julyof whichto date havebeen shippedPromised toPrance forAugust147   41   43200   62   34  (a)  (a)   (a) 90    6   127115   11232421318813 0055245   58   5013963620     (a)  Additional equipments completed and ordered for shipment,          18-pdrs v 63. 4.5M  - 25.  60-pdrs - 15.     (b)  20 more in possession of 5 Batteries mobilized at Home.          I may add that we are exchanging 50 at a time, 350 new18-pdrs from Home Defence Batteries with others from Prance with aremaining life of at least 2,000 rounds apiece.   By this means weshall give the F.M.C-in-C, in Prance additional gun power (barringaccidents) to the extent of 3  million rounds.   We have also centto Prance every reserve 6&quot; Gun that we had in Coast Defences in theUnited Kingdom - 11 in all.          *ihe Pield Marshal1 s figures show clearly our difficulties ineven maintaining, let alone increasing, the Batteries he has underhis command, and fortify the statement with which you concludedyour memorandum to the War Cabinet, concerning the supply of gunsto Kussia, on 16th June, 1917DERBY.17th July,  1917.
