          GENERAL STATEMENT OP  THE IjgED FOR AMERICAN SUFPI-IES  Oil1 MAlgRIALg FOR MUNITIONS.     1,    The  case  for an ample supply of Artillery and AnmrJiiition needs no  elaboration,  for  it is new axiomatic that casualties  in the  field vary inversely with superiority in munitions.::  Given  adequate transport,  the capacity  of the  Army to  use Ammunition is only limitedby the supply of gans available for firing it.   The wastage of guns is enoimous  and  taxes  all our gun manufacturingresources to naliitain our  guns in the field.                j    2*    The Ministry of Munitions has  for the  past twelve1 Imonths been in a position  to supply all the  Ammunitionthat the  guns could  fire,  and  in  machinery,  assemblingand filling, capacity there is  even a  fair margin capableof dealing with  a  further  increase in output.   Ourdifficulty has been  to secure  an  adequate  supply ofmaterials notably  in the following cases I.*-     jlij   Sfte;ll &apos;oto,e 1&quot;.;y 30$ of  the  requirements  have to  bepurchased in  the United  States, owing (a)  to theinsufficiency of Home production  which  is  limited bothby furnace capacity  and by the difficulty  of importing :an adequate supply of ore, and (b) to  the  enormousdemand for steel plates  for ship  building  purposes,   (ii)--&apos;:-&apos;Non^fejrrous^&amp;j.;alBiv  In  spite  of  the restriction  jjof consumption in Great Britain to essential War purposes,all supplies availe/blo are at :once consumed, and it hashitherto been impossible to build up  stocks in thiscountry./
 country. .It:should also be added that in several of. these cases, e.g.  copper and lead,  where supplies came almost entirely from overseas,  all  available supplies from- countries outside  the U.S0A.  have been purchased so far as possible so that the  United  States is only called upon to supply the  balance of requirements..         :In the case of  lead, supply is already insufficient to meet demands  and the production of Shrapnel Shells is in consequence causing some anxiety. These difficulties have  been  accentuated by the shortage of tonnage,  which  is making it  more  and more essential to concentrate purchases in the countries which are situated relatively short distance s  from the UnitedKingdom.. The  United States, is  by far the most important of these countries.          ,          It  will probably be  found at an early date that the tonnage  facilities from Australasia will not  be sufficient  to  provide  freight for the Broken Hill Cols exports  of  lead to this  country&apos;,  and  as  50$  of our present  requirements is  provided  from this source,  : it may be that the States;will  be called upon  to  fillwhatever deficiency appears.     3.   Practically all tho guns required for theBritish  Forces are manufactured in the United  Kingdom.A  few are on order in - the U.S.At  and  it  is desirable&apos;.that -the- manufacture of.  these/should be  placed on a footing  of  first priority so-far; as.output of  munitions
In the u-.S,A.vis concernod.  !;  4,. * Owing  to  the  very large&apos; developments of resourcesin the &quot;United. -Kingdom  fcrttanttfafc1jn.ro and repair of&apos;gunsit will be&apos;possible  during 1918 to  maintain in theField a much  larger  number of guns  even than in 1917. -The &apos;estimated expenditure  in  1918 is,.-therefore, -largely.in exoess  of  the expenditure  hitherto reali sod,         There has &quot;been throughout  tho War a greatincroase in the proportion of heavy ammunition consumedand this makes a heavy-demand on materials.   The  bestindex, -therefore, of the programme  is.the net&apos;weight- of -ammunition fired per week... This is shQwn. in the  followingtable together with  a  figure  f$r 1918 assuming that-ourpresent programme materialises;   EXPENDITURE Off.

From this statement it is  obvious  that  the  amountmaterial obtained from the U:..S,.A* can at least not bedecreased if the programme fer 1918 is to be carried out.:    5,-   The dependence of the supply of munitions on rawor finished materials from the United States during  thoperiod January v March 1917 is, given in a letter attachedto this - memorandum,.    6.,:*  For the more imp extant metals the  following tableshows fof-the period1 Ji^iiiary --June 1917,. the proportionwhioh^

It has also been found necessary to purchase largequantities of propellents in tho United States, mainly onaooount of the large saving in tonnage effected &quot;by buying thefinished articlo rather than importing raw materials andmaking up the finished propellant in this country.   Ingeneral terms the saving Q  tonnago is 4 tQ X.,which supplies from the U.S.A. hear to total consumption forall war purposes and to consumption incurrod in manufactureof shells for the ammunition programme.

(1)  Viewing munitions supplies as a whole, about 2G$of the total expenditure on munitions by Gredt Britainsince the beginning of the War has been in the United St-atosof America.  But this figure exaggerates the proportion ofactual munitions obtained from that country; as pricesin tho Unitod States have on the whole been very much higherthan prices in the United Kingdom.  Taking differences of :price into account the proportion of munitions is morecorrectly expressed as approximately 24$ of the totalsupply.          As regards tonnage,  imports of munitions andmaterials from the U.8.A. form only 1/7 of the total importsof these articles,         &apos;    (2)  The main items in respect of which expenditure hasbeen incurred together/with the approximate proportions ofthe total quantities v/hieh have been:procured from the \United States in the period from January 1916 to March 1917are as follows:-
