 C  H B T.                 WAR CABINET.mt  1474.             ITAXIAH CLAIMS Iff ASIA HIHOR.Memorandum byLord -Robert Cecil,     The Cabinet will recollect that after the.Conference  at  St,. Jean de Maurienne,. they made definite propositions to  Italy modifying to  some extent what was,there provisionally  agreed.. Since that time, considerable discussion has. taken place between us and the Italians^ and an agreement has been reached on  all out^ standing points except one..  It, was provided at  Sto  Jean de Maurienne that &quot;if at the time when poa.ce is, declared  the  total or &quot;partial possession of the territories contemplated  in the agree- ments come to between Great Britain,. France,  Italy and Russia,, as &quot;to  the disposal of a part of the Ottoman Empire, cannot bo fully accorded to one or more of these Powers, then the interests of &quot;the Powers, concerned will be again taken into equitable considera-  I &quot;tion, having regard to the efforts.made by  each of  the Powers &quot;in  the ,Tar&quot;,  .    ;:Baron, Sonnino strongly objected to the  concluding phrase &quot;having regard to the efforts made by each of the Powers in the &quot;war&quot;..  After several Interviews with the Italian Ambassador  I proposed to him either to leave out the whole of the clause quoted   I above * or to  substitute for the words of the Clause  beginning &quot;then the interests; of the Powers ,.,,,,,&quot; down  to the ond(&quot;in the  war&quot;) the following words - &quot;Then&apos;in any alterations or &quot;adjustments  of the provinoes of the Turkish Empire  consequential &quot;on  the war due regard shall be had. to. the preservation of the &quot;equilibrium  in the Mediterranean in accordance  with Article  9 of &quot;the London Agreement of May 1915&quot;..  To this latter  suggestion Baron Sbnnino has agreed,, except that he wishes  to say instead of &quot;due regard shall be had&quot; -&quot;equitable consideration shall be given&quot;,       . .         - ;     ; , -. &apos;  \ - - .                            I   v On  the whole I see no objection to his  proposed amendment, which,, indeed, appears to me slightly less favourable  to the  Italian f Government, as being less mandatory in tone,  than the  words I originally proposed,      -     In  accordance with an undertaking I have given  to the Ambass- ador, I now submit this matter to the War Cabinet for  their accept-  1 ance or  rejection.  The new phrase proposed  by me seems to me to   .  I leave the matter exactly where it was under  the  original agreement of May 1915, .except that it only applies.to  alterations or adjust- ments to Turkey made in consequence of the war,  and  therefore would  j have no  application to Cyprus.  It is also to be noted that as com-  f pared with the suggestion made at St. Jean do Maurienno it only deals with the Mediterranean equilibrium,: and would, thereforet.exclude all consideration of Mosopctamia or. Arabia.  In other  words, unless the French, obtain part of the Eastern Mediterranean,-&apos;;the . Italians would not be entitled to claim anything under this Clause,
