-T1CHDT.  T. 14193,WAJR CABIESToISji OF SHU COIJHITTBG TO COHSISBR THEMemorandum on, &quot;by the Food Controller,kase of lee forces,The Committee proposed to set up an organization to purchase250,000 head of cattle for the Array during the last fivemonths of 1917, at the following prices:- ugust : 0*0* *.. ,..........* ..  77/- per live cwt?September               .....  74/-   &quot;0eto.be.r-December  ...,72/-  . &quot;ItThe Committee &quot;point out that :the effect of  endeavouring to  buyabout 25 to .30$ more animals than would normally come  intothe market must be to increase  civil prices considerably ifCivil prices are.left uncontrolled.,  ilt is  necessary,  there-fore,, to fix -prices for cattle  or; meajfc not  only for the Army,.but for the civil population.It has already been agreed that the date  of the commennement .of the scheme should be deferred until September 1st.These proposed prices are understood to be  mainly justifiedby the high price of stores in  certain months  of 1917.   ThePresident of the Board Of Agriculture has -recognised that thecost of producing;beef - plus a reasonable  profit would  be re-paid;: by a lorice of about 60/&apos;- per live cwt.  were it not forthe fact that some farmers have purchased stores at except-ionaliy high, prices,.The ?ood- Controller cannot admit the fact that a certainnumber of farmers who anticipated that the  high meat priceswould continue and.have paid high prices  for their stores isa suffioient  justification for  imposing on.the rest of;the..population the hardships involved lay these  high prices :&apos; ormeat.  He feels strongly that in justice  to  the industrial&apos;   /                                              consumer
oonsumor meat prices must be reduced substantially below theprices proposed by the Committee...    If this involves particularf&amp;riners in a loss on particular transactions, he thinks that thelarge profits made out ef cattle during the war should be takeninif) account and any particular oases of this kind should not beheld to justify the continued imposition of high meat prices.      In order to meet any such hard cases he would prefer  thatarrangements should be made to compensate farmors who have  boughtstores oh the high basis whilst&apos; the general price is kept dewn.: a$or this purpose he has suggested to the Committee that  theyshould consider whether a scheme ceuld bo devised under whichoompmnsation might be paid through the machinery- (strengthened ;for this purpose) of the Civil liability Commissioners te farmerswhr might be involved in a: loss on their year\s  trading.     TheCommittee, however, &apos;is of opinion that  the assessment of:compensation would be very difficult and might  lead - to morediscontent than a drastic and general reduction  in prices,      If a&apos; scheme of compensation for the hard  cases can be&apos;devised the Foed Controller suggests that the basis of purchasefor the Army, which would determine the civil price,, should bebrought down to 60/- from the 1st September-.     a If it is considered that methods  involving  the assessing  afcompensation are impracticable, he suggests  that;the, price  shouldhit exceed 67/- per Uve cwt. &quot;f or September  and  October and sheuldn*t exceed; 60/- per live cwt. for&apos;, November and December.      The prices in each case apply to an animal  yieldingspproximately;53 to 55$&apos; meat,- i.e,. a second  quality animal. &apos;Corresponding prices will have to be fired for mutton and
 porki    &quot;                                -       :-&apos;V;&apos;.; --   -;-&apos; V:-   ,     In the yiew of the Food Controller which-sver course  . is adopted, the prices proposed by-the Committee are much ,. too high.    In this connection the  following points should be taken into  consideration      (l) August and September prieos are usually about 10fo below thVmaximun prices fot the year.   In 1916/, the reduction in &quot;the Autumn was substantially more than 10f0 below the maximnm prices reached in  June, &apos; If the .s.ame proportion al  reduction in prices occurred this year^  the prices ofor cattle: of Army           quality fir August  and September would be substantially below the  prices proposed by the Committee without any intervention by the  Government, &apos;       (2) It is  yitally important &quot;that it should not be profitable  to  slaughter milk cows for meat,   On the pre-war relationship between milk and meat prices,: the hi guest  price for  second-quality cattle which  would afford  no  inducement for the  slaughter  of milch cows is approximately  70/- to  7B/-6 per.cwt. for September.  The relation may be  different later, in  view. of the  possible  increase in milk prices,  but  it  is essential that the price of meat,  when  fixedj   should be substantiallybelow the figure, quoted,  if no risk  is to be  run,        (3) Apart from  the question of the cost of stores,  theactual  increase in the  cost of production of  beef,  allowing                        price of cake and increase  in thefor the considerable increase  in  the/cost of  labour, shouldnot exceed 60$ of the pre-war  arice..  On  this basis the priceof cattle pf Army quality..should not  be more  than60/.- per cwt,         $ &apos;    .         &apos;                     &quot; &apos; .7       Arr^gements are  in hand, which are expected to  reduce theprice of feedingrstuffs  and to secufce a more  equitabledistribution among farmers.
             (4)&apos;  The increased price allowed for wool is 50$     above pre-war prices-&apos;.   The increased-price of Hides is     40$ to 46$ above pre-war prices..  The increased, price of     Sheep Pelts&apos;is!similarly about&apos; 46fc above pre-war prices.     The proposed  figure of 57s. Od,  for cattle would secure:a     considerably  higher percentage rise above pre-war prices,lies for       It  is proposed to fix the prices of &quot;cattle for11 Popula-.)n. Maximum &quot; the Army on a live \7eight basis.  This is clearlyd Weight.                          &apos; PlX            more convenient since the Army requires cattle of     standardised  condition yielding about 54$ meat, but it     wili be more  convenient in the inception of the scheme to     control the prices of meat for civilian consumption by ;     reference to  the wholesale .price of meat, leaving the actual     price&apos; of the  animal to be determined by individual bargaining     with the knowledge that the meat must be sold, within the     maximum price.  It would.clearly be&quot;impossible to justify     different wholesale prices for different districts and..it     will therefore be necessary to fix a general wholesale     maximum price of meat for the whole- country.               For securing that the machinery for distribution     works smoothly and easily in the early stages, it will be&apos;&apos;     necessary to  arrange for the fixing of a flat rate for     railway transport independent of the distance.   This has     been done in the case of wool and other articles.s,-Experience
icioessi-tjy a r.iin:oir&quot;4.securing supplies for the;.Army and for the civil  .population should be parts of the same general scheme, asotherwise there will bo overlapping and-friction and itwill be impossible properly to-organise distribution.The schemeproposed proceeds on the asstuuptio^that thesame organisation will deal with both sides of the problem.     It is further desirable that the&apos;organisation forsecuring supplies should ho responsible only to oneDepartment..  At the present moment the Ministry of Pood,tho Board of Trade and tho Board of Agriculture areresponsible in undefined degrees.  It, is proposed thatthe Ministry of Pood should bo completely rosponsiblofor the whole arrangements, utilising of course thoexpert knowledge and assistance of other Departmentsto the fullest possible extent,  ^                              (Signed)   BHOIDDA.16th July,  1917,Lrganisa-   Experience of maximum prices in this country, in &quot; ^utiqn&apos; Germany and elsewhere, shews that they must he accompanied         by a scheme for securing equitable distribution oi? there         will be most serious danger of distribution breaking down.         Under normal eireumstahoos a shortage of supplies in any         locality results in a rise of prices which immediately         brings supplies.   If maximum prices are fixed, this         automatic method of distribution ceases to operate and it         is,  therefore,  essential to substitute a carefully         organised scheme of control.for the purpose of securing         that supplies come forward regularly and at the rate at         which consumption can bo allowed and that they are         distributed equitably throughout-the consuming areas,      tv for      is obviously necessary that tho arrangements for
