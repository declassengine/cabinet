fy   G.T. 1494^WAR CABINET.SPITZBERGEN.    COPY OF MEMORANDUM PREPARED IN THE FOREIGN OFFICE *(Circulated with reference to Paper G.T.  1330  and also  G.T.  1489.)      It does not seem necessary to go into the history ofSpitzbergen.  The present international status of the islandscan be put briefly as follows:-They are &quot;terra nulliue&quot; in which Great Britain,&apos; Denmark,France, Germany, Holland, Norway,  Russia,  Sweden and the UnitedStates of America are interested in varying degrees.  AnInternational Conference was held in June and July 1914,. re-specting the administration of the group but adjourned withoutreaching a decision.  Various claims have been pegged out byBritish and other companies but the titles of any of thesecompanies or syndicates to the land they claim are in any caseshadowy, owing to the fact that there is no sovereign state orcentral authority from which they could hold such titles.  Theattitude adopted by His Majesty^ Government has always beenthat they have no political interests in Spitzbergen and theyare only concerned to see that such rights as British claimantsmay have established there are properly protected.      At the beginning of the war there were two chief Britishcompanies concerned with concessions in Spitzbergen, theScottish Spitzbergen Syndicate, and the Northern ExplorationCompany.  In February and again in November,  1915, the lattercompany wrote to Sir E. Grey urging the annexation of Spitzbergento the British Crown.  Their arguments in favour of this coursewere:      (1)  Strategical.  The importance of the islands-as acoaling station and naval base on the new ice-free route toRussia.      (2)  Political..  To defeat alleged German designs onthe islands after the war.  In support of this it should bementioned that the German Government had established a smallwireless station on the islands prior to the war,  and thatthroughout the whole of the International Conference of 1914the German Representatives adopted an attitude arrogatingto Germanya much larger share in the administration of theIslands than her interests there seemed to warrant.      (3)  Commercial..  The existence of rich coal, iron oredeposits, as well as marble, magnetite iron,  molybdenum,  ironand copper pyrites, asbestos and other minerals.
     As regards the points made by the Company \l) waselearly for the Admiralty to decide.   As to (2)  the Germanwireless station is a low power station which can onlycorrespond through the stronger Norwegian;station, andearly in the war the German station was closed and oannot nowtransmit or receive messages.   It is in charge of Norwegianearetekcrs.. and its German operators left for Germany early inthe W3r.   As matters now stand the Norwegian Government arescarcely likely to reopen the German station in the interestsof Germany.   Apart from this the political advantages ofannexing Spitzbergen appeared at the time to be very smalland the difficulties connected with any such idea very great.Owing to the peculiar status of Spitzbergen any arbitrary acton our part would almost inevitably embroil Great Britain withone at least of her Allied\j namely &amp;ussia*  and would createthe worst possible effect in Norway and Sweden, the former ofwhich two countries may perhaps be said to have a strongerclaim to the island than Great Britain.     The commercial aspect of the question, point (3) was noteoneidered fully in November 191!?.   No operations of any kindwould be possible until the summer of 1916 and the onlyapparent advantage of Great Britain securing a predominantinterest in the coal fields at that time was in order toprevent them falling into the hands of Sweden or Norway, andthus making those countries independent of British coal andof the consequent pressure which Great Britain could in thisway exercise on them in contraband questions.     Sir E, Grey consequently referred the matter to theAdmiralty proposing to inform the Company that the questioncould not be considered at the present moment in view of theclaims of Allied and neutral countries which could not bedisregarded in Battling the question of Spitzfcergen.Sir E. Grey also considered that the status of Spitzbergenshould be noted for discussion at the end of the war.  OnJanuary l^th, 1916\ the Admiralty concurred in the replyproposed by Sir E, Grey.     Meanwhile the Northern Exploration Company informedSir E. Grey that in virtue of a prior agreement they werecontemplating transferring a large number of their sharesto Aktiebolaget Isfjorden-Belsand, a Swedish Company, andthey at the same time suggested that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment might think it advantageous to purchase the Company&apos;sconcessions on the islands.   It appeared inequitable to preventthe Company from carrying out thoir obligation to the SwedishCompany but it was also feared that if Sweden acquiredthose rights before the close of the summer she might be ina position to work the mines to her own ai&quot;antage and thusbecome, at any rate in part, independent of British coalsupplies.   It was further reported, though with inconclusiveevidence, that the transaction proposed by the company mightresult in a considerable part of these interests fallinginto German hands.   As to the proposal that His Majesty^Government should purchase the properties of the Company,it did not appear that this was advantageous from apolitical point of view even if the company could give a goodtitle which was doubtful.     The Admiralty were again oonsulted and replied thatthere were no strategical reasons for acquiring the Company&apos;3concessions in the iBlands.   It was, however,  thoughtthat the Ministry of Munitions might be interested in thecoal and iron and might wi h to make some arrangement withthe Company for the purchase of the output.   The Ministry
of Munitions, however,  considered that the property couldnot be developed in time for the output to be of anyimportance during the war, and therefore they did not proposeto take any action of the nature suggested.   The Companywere accordingly informed on May 24th, 1916. that HisMajesty&apos;s Government-did not wish to purchase their properties;they had previously been requested not to handover theshares to the Swedish Company until the end of the summerand had beeh warned that this transaction might possiblylead to a charge Of trading with the enemy.     In November 19l6 the Northern Exploration Company, theSoottish Syndicate and Colonel Yate again urged annexation,cheifly for commercial reasohs, it being alleged thatvaluable magnetite, etcr- wa3 to be found in the islands.The Ministry of Munitions, howeverj advised that this hadlittle1 commercial value and they were not prepared to sendan expedition to ihe islands  in 1917 to  investigate theirmintral resources.   The Admiralty again repeated that therewere no naval reasons for annexing Spitzbergen and that  aformal annexation without naval force to support it wouldnot prevent  the  islands being used by the  enemy  if it shouldbe of any advantage  for him to  do so, which the  Admiraltyclearly doubted-     Colonel Yate who was informed of these views then urgedthat  in case the Germane  should think of using Sptizbergenas a  submarine base, one  of His Majesty&apos;s  Ships  shouldbe  sent to  the islands  at the opening of the  season toremove  or destroy the German  wireless  station.   Thisquestion was left entirely to the Admiralty,.but their viewswere  invited on  the  whole subject once more in view of thefact  that a regular  campaign  had been opened  not only bythe  companies referred  to above, but  by  the..Royal, Geographicalbociety and various  Chambers  of Commerce as well as byColonel Yate.    The  Admiralty replied that  they  did notdesire  to modify their  previous views  regarding  the strategicadvantage in annexing the islands.    As  regards  the Germanwireless  station they were  satisfied  that  it  had beendismantled  and thai  this  appeared to  be  all that wasrequired.      This is the present  state  of the question,  but ColonelYate who has been  informed  of this continues  to  suggestofawar.  wirelee8 station should be seized as a  prize        veal W^th Coionel Yate&apos;8 points  seriatim itmay ba  observed**i*Jlh Th?r?  is ^evidence  of large  quantities of oo&amp;lJSi^S-8?1??64 lT?m Spitsbergen-to- Horway and Sweden:   andJ*! fl,lBt/y 0t Munit^ns have advised that the minerals inthe islands  are  commercially  unimportant at present?regard2!ft-S?Hv!B no d?^nite evidence  of German activity inregard to Spitzbergen either  at the moment or for the&apos; future?
   (3)  The Admiralty are satisfied that  the wireless station is useless.   (4)  The mere fact that Norway is now  in charge ofthe wireless station gives her no title to thesovereignty of the islands as Colonel Ycte suggests.   (5)  The German wireless station is not situated inGerman territory and the German, minefields are notGerman territory, so that it would &quot;be impossible for theBritish forces to seize them and occupy them withoutprotest from other Powers ne&amp;trol and Allied interestedin Spitsbergen.
