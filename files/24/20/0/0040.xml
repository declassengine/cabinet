9/9826.               WAR CABINET.      Protective Coloration of Tents.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for War.          With reference to War Cabinet 154(4), I desire toreport that &quot;CutohH dye is now in general use for oolouringtents in military camps in the London District and in theNorthern and  astern Commands, which latter includes Shorncliffe.          Observation from the air shows that painting thetents in large irregular patches of drab and dull green is themost effective means towards rendering them invisible.   Theresults of any scheme of colouration are however disappointing,in view of the fact that the regularity of the lineB of tente,their characteristic shadows, and the discoloration of theground round the tents, betray the situation of a camp to anexperienced Air Observer.          Arrangements are being made to colour the tent3 draband green and to vary the plans on which camps are pitched with  aview to avoiding as far as possible the regularity of the lines.                                    DERBY.17th July, 1917.
