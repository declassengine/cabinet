LABOURADVISORY COEVMITTSE.  .          -      &apos; -   -.:  Steady progress is being made with the arrangements to obtain the services of miners not fully occupied  to assist in harvesting.     The question of labour from coal miners for  Iron Ore Mines still occupies the attention of the Labour Advisory Committee,: and  considerable difficulty is being experienced.in regard to  ;&apos; the  wage question, the men&apos;s earnings in their new work being a so much  less than in the coal mines.     ; The, Labour Advisory Committee are of  opinion that:  the v,&apos; adoption of the equal-sharing system for all workers under
the contracts&quot; for iron ore&quot;getting would be an advantage--aiid^that less frequent ^revision of contrac^-prtoes--should be ar-ranged.  . .AGRIC OLTURALJ5EC;TI OJj,1.::: ^litary Labour on Farms: ,.    (a)  England and Wales,   The returns made by the Agricul-tural Commissioners of the National Service Department showthat the numbers of men placed from this class of labour are:-           Promised     ....     12,700           Arrived      ....     12,055           Sent out     ;...      9,144.    Some protests have been made as to the unskilled laboursupplied and the Food Production Department has been requestedto intimate to the various War Agricultural Committees concern-ed that the labour supplied is the host obtainable and the bestUBe must be made of the material at their disposal.   On thewhole the men are acceptable and good work is being done inall branches of farming operations.    (b)  Scotland.   1,200 men have been distributed to date.2.  National Service Volunteers.    (a)  England and TTales. .  The number of such Volunteers sofar passed (after interview) for Agriculture Is 2,851; 1,532Volunteers have been asked for by the Local War AgriculturalCommittees and 57G have been placed, and this rosult may per-haps be considered not unsatisfactory in view of the difficultyof inducing firms to accept unskilled labour.3.  Part-Time Labour.    (a)  Hay Harvest.    The completion of the special reporton this subject is stili delayed by tho pressure of other work,but it is hoped that iv will be finished next week.    (b)  Corn HardestA c;      Scheme has been approved for an appeal through theNational Service Committees  for men for the Com Harvest.   TheFood Production Department have been requested to intimatetheir requirements and approximate dates yhen t he labour islikely to be needed.
 (c)  Miners.   As r*port^-.und^--&apos;Uie-4^abo^^ Advl84*rTTKmBnit^oe^ , arrangements are being made for the use of Uiners in harvest work. (d^  School Boy &amp; Professional Labour.   The demands for this class of labour will absorb about 4,00.6 boys and considerable numbers are already proceeding to camps to work on the land. In addition, the Department has been able to place individuals who have offered their services during their vacations for harvest work, and there is still a small reserve of such labour to supply any further needs that may arise, GENERAL TRADES SECTION, (a)  Trade Committees for Substitution purposes.     On all hands it is stated that volunteering continues to bo hampered by the belief that the men who volunteer are not wanted.   The men themselves believe this as they see that men who enrolled as National Service Volunteers wore often not re- quired, and the Local Committees are driven to the same con- clusion in the absence of any demands upon them from the Area Substitution Officers.   This belief was strongly expressed at a General Conference held by the Building Trades Central Com-mittee at which the Director of the Trades Section was present.The fact that the terms of payment have not yet been officially settled by the Treasury, so that no authoritative pronouncementcan be made to tho mentis also having an adverse effect uponj.the scheme.     Tho Heavy Castings Trade having signified their willing-ness to co-operate with the Light Castings Trade, a conferenceon the matter is to take place on Tuesday, July 17th.   It Isreported also that the Piano Trade Scheme has made some progressand a conference in connection with this is to be held onMonday, July 16th.     A conference was held during the week with the Trade Unionsin the Light Leather Trade who expressed their willingness  toco-operate in a scheme for the transfer of men either  to  theHeavy Leather Trade or to Kunitlons,  and their opinion that
the state of employment in the Light Le&amp;ther Tr^-aii .jpr^sentwould make such transfer possible.  ;V Some 216 men have now been transferred from the WorthWales Slate Quarries,  and a start has been made in connectionwith the scheme for the transfer of men from coal mines toironstone mines by the drafting of 14 men from the South WalesAnthracite Mine3.    In this connection it may be pointed out,however, that difficulties arise in connection with the trans-for of men which it is not in the power of the National Ser-vice Department to overcome.   Thus in one case in connectionwith the transfer of men from coal mines it is stated by theNational Service Commissioner for Wales that it cannot be ex-pecttd that the transfer could be carried, through inasmuch asthe wages the men are  offered at their new work is barely halfthat which they are  earning at their present work.-   In anothercase where labour was  asked for in connection with the WeardaleLoad Mines transfer was impossible owing to the want of lodgingaccommodation; and the difficulty is being overcome by the Minis-try of Munitions obtaining German prisoners 1  labour living undercanvas, -   -           -                                 -v-     -(b)  Reserved Occupat1ons Committoe,     In connection with thework of this Committee representations have been made to theMilitary Authorities that they should make an organised effortto release low category men now in the Army who would be usefulin industry in exchange for Class A and Bl men; and during theweek practical effect  was given to these recommendations by theCommittee sending to the War Office a list of employees of theBradford Dyers1 Association of low medical category in exchangefor whom the Association are willing to release an equal numberof Class A and B.1 men, with the recommendation of the Committeethat the War Office should go as far as they can in effectingthe exchange which obviously is advantageous  both to the Army andIndustry.
NATIONAL SBRVICE (LOCAL)  COHMITTIilES.The number of National Service Committees appointed todate is as under:-To date.  866  142Last Week,   862   139In England and vYalesIn Scotland     ... SUBSTITUTION SECTION.     The returns furnished for this week show 2,307 applica- tions for Volunteers, 1,9.90 Volunteers submitted, 806 Volunteers placed.   /         ::--;-V*^-v -      ^ -     These results show slight improvement upon previous  figures, and there is evidence that the local substitution machinery is getting into better working order, as A.S.01s are in closer touch with Trades and N.S, Commissioners,   The capacity  of the Substitution Staff is still considerably greater than the work so far given to them to do,     Reports on the. work of the National Service Committees in some localities show that the prospects of obtaining Substitution Volunteers through their agency are not promising, as the combing out process by the Military Authorities has been so rigorous as to leave no workers available as substitutes.     Certain Area Commanders have called upon the Substitution Officers to assist the Munitions Area Recruiting Officers In their work,   Representations have bean made to the War Office pointing out that these Officers are in the service of the  National service Department and that no instructions therefore should have been given thorn by the Commanding Officers.   There arc still cer- tain areas for which permanent A.S.0&apos;s have not yet been  appointed by the War Office and suitable representations have been  made to that office on this subject.   It is understood that for  tho pres- ent the tfar Office desire to continue the arrangement in  force that they shall appoint these Area Substitution Officers, but ey- perience suggests that in the near future those officers  may have to be brought entirely within the control of the National Service,Department,
WOKENTS SECTION.  ;.                        ^^-^-/V&apos;&apos;     In view of the-^or^ea^eoV^from the Board of Agriculture and the War Office it is evident thata recruiting campaign will have to be inaugurated on a cons5dorab3ylarger  scale than anything whioh has yet been attempted.  In thisconnection it is  proposed to make every possible use of the localNational Service  Committees and instructions will be placed Intheir hands as soon as the arrangements with the War Office arefinally completed.    Under present schemes there is a very largewastage of recruits,  e.g.  50$ of those offering service on the landfail to appear when called up for interview.   It is felt thatthis wastage should be energetically followed up and an endeavourmade to secure the  services of all volunteers for one or other ofthe occupations for which women are new needed.     Enrolments for the Land Army, up to date, are as follows:-              England       ...      35,5io              Scotland      ...       3,036              Ireland                   33                       Total:        gSTBMT     These offers have been communioated to the Board of Agri-culture for the selection of suitable candidates.Timber  Supplies Department.     Women recruits for timber work are coming forward slowly andthe supply requires stimulation.  -     Arrangements which had been made to supply women for thiswork in Gloucestershire have had to be cancelled as the TimberSupplies Department had taken steps to get the work done by malePortuguese labour.Cotton  &amp; Wollen Waste Collection,  for Army Clothing Purpo3es^     Satisfactory progress is  being made with the  work of thisSection, and in view of the serious shortage in the supply ofwool it has been  represented to the Treasury as a  matter of urgent im-portance that their restrictions limiting the districts where these
collections may be made ^should be withdrawn.   The  Officersin charge of this  work in the National  SeWlce Departmentare convinced that a large supply of waste wool  is  avail-able if these voluntary  offerings of material can be ofrgan-ised throughout the Country, and the proceeds, in monetary : -value,  considerably exceed the expenses of collection.   TheArmy authorities have expfreaeed their appreciation  of thesupply already secured,  arid urge upon the Department the needfor a wider sphere of action,                (Signed)  NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN.July 14th, 1917.      DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF NATIONAL SERVICE.
