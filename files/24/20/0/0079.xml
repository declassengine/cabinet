/ mm! a;;&quot; \-v;/v;    War Cabinet.W/l*Uh/Ul.        The Military Situation in Ireland.               jCemorandum by the Secretary of State for War.                     I circulate for the information of the War Cabinet           the subj oined memorandum by Pield Marshal Viscount Prench,           dated 17th July, 1917, which he handed to me yesterday.                                           DERBY.           21st July, 1917.          I have Just concluded a Tour of inspection inIreland, and &quot;having; regard tc the somewhat exiticalcondition of unrss &amp; in that country 1% would perhapsinterest you to hear my views as to the Military Situation.          I visited Clonmsl,  Permoy,  Cork, Dublin,  TheCurragh, Boyle, Athlone,  Galway and Belfast,  at which placesthe Heads of the Constabulary gave me full information asto the general attitude and condition of the people in tneirown immediate neighbourhood.    I held ceremonial reviews -ofall the troops that could be got together at Cork,  Dublin^The Curragh and Belfast.          There can be no doubt that the disDl^y of troopsroused a good deal of Military enthusiasm throughout thevarious localities where they were held;  large crowds werein the streets and on the review grounds, and cheeredvociferously:  this was particularly marked at Cork.          The appearance of the men on Parade was splendid.The horses in the mounted troops looked hard and fit,  andthe manner in which the parade movements were carried outshowed the result of very careful training.   All who werepresent at these reviews must have been strongly impressedby the efficiency of the Army in Ireland and their ability,so far as their numb esrsl went, to meet any situation whichmay arise.          Throughout this tour I have been constantly onthe move, and to judge by the general appearance andattitude of the people one would suppose the Country to  bevery prosperous, happy ^and contended.          The local Police Authorities whom I interviewedat all the places visited, expressed many and varied; viewsand opinions;  but they were unanimous in thinking thatthere is no danger of anything occurring in the  immediatefuture like the events of April,  1916.   They consideredhowever, that local rioting on a more or less extensivescale is not unlikely.          It is outside my province to discuss the PoliticalSituation in Ireland except in so far as it affects themilitary measures and precautions which are necessary forthe preservation of law and order,  but as a matter of factit is agreed on all sides that the number of pes-ole openlyprofessing Sinn Pein principles and symnathies ia  vastlygreater now than it was a year ago,  nor i s there anysatisfactory evidence that considerable quantities of Armsare not hidden a^ay.                                                        It
          It is quite evident that strenuous attempts arebeing made to infuse organisation, order and disciplineinto this mass of rebels, and it is doubtless realised bythe leaders that, to be effective, it must be a work oftime as such efforts have to cover a vast and veryscattered area.   Their chief object is to allay suspicionat the moment and prevent all local and isolated attemptsat disorder by over-zealous patriots,   For the reasonsstated I am of opinion that for the time being the Forcesnow at the disposal of Sir B.T. Mahon are sufficient tomeet any possible outbreak in its early stages,  providedUnits are strictly maintained at their present strengthand efficiency;  and so long as we possess the same powerand ability,  as at present,  to reinforce Ireland at amoment1s notice.   If,  however, the Sinn Fein movement isallowed to develop on the lines indicated, a stage will bereached before very long when the Garrison of the Countrywill have to  be considerably increased.
