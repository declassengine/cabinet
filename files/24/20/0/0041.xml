MeaoraHdum, 1?y tt)ie Secretary^ef Stats, for Har.          j,      I circulate \uo Minutes iy the Director, of Secruitihg      and  the Adjutant General respectively on the present recruiting      position.          il)   Minute hy the1 director of Recruiting:-               - I desire once again to place on record my firm   \  cenvi^tion that the present method o  reoruiting i&amp; thoroughly                I think that when the re-organisatie&amp; ricently      approved has been completed the niliiary machine will b* as grood      as it can be made in the circumstances imposed upoh us by the      Acts under which we have to work and by the decisions of the    :War; Cabinet.                Under these we cannot avoid grave injustice and      ultimate failure.&quot;  The in just ices which are perpetrated from      day to day under these  Ats and decisions are in mj: opinion      seriously undermining the moral of the Nation.  Undoubtedly    /  they are fanning the embers of pacificism.                I trust that the matter will once again deceive      the attention of the Arn$r Council and that this aspect of the      situation will once again be pressed upon the Government *                I believe that it would be more in the interests      of victory to stop recruiting altogether for a time than      to continue as at&apos;present if only we eeuld be satisfied that we      were to be permitted to recruit fairly and justlymthereafter *        ,  (2)   Minute by the Adjutant General:-                I entirely endorse the remarks of D. of 3. ana. I: do      not hesitate to say that we are now face to face with a      situation which is grave in tha extreme, if the existing forces      In the various theatres of war are to be kept within sight of      their war establishment.                On several occasions, during the last 16 months, I      have had cause for anxiety on the score of recruiting, but have      always been able to utilise some expedient which has aaintained      the flow of,recruits in a greater or lesser degree.                Since the ls,t January we have managed to send      364,727 British&apos; infantrv drafts to various theatres of war, of      which 301,350 were for France.                Last acntk I augmented the ordinary flew ^y suaoarily      ordering all available iaea\in reserve and training units at home,      who had returned from theatrofl of war sick or wounded, out to      France, by ,which 25,000 men Were obtained, and I am now about to      reteat tfcg game process in regard to the same class of men, at      present&apos; in Command Depotsor Convalescent Hospitals. (               This is an expedientwhich, in ijy opinion, is      rutf&amp;amentally wrong, but \% is the only one that remains to us.
machine          Recruiting returns from January to June,  19*7,  hothinclusive,  show that during the1  month of June the intake  waslower than In any previous month in:the year, viz.,  41,879i  ofwhom 12,387 are under 19 years: of age, and will not  be availablefor i&amp;any months.    This means that we only obtained 29,492General Service men in the month, a figdre not nearly Sufficientto replace the ordinary wastage, irrespective of heavy fighting  .         :In my Memorandum of 31st May, 19171 1 endeavoured toraake clear the main reasons which militated against  redruiting.. - ,The Review of Exceptions Act is  intensely unpopular in.thecountry,  and is affecting the: spirit in which Tribunals regardrecruiting,  with the resdlt that men are exempted by Tribunalsout of pure sympathy.          Peeling in the country is also affected by the presentpolicy of employing soldiers in  civil occupations.          The daily reports on the Unrest in Labour Circlesemphasise the dissatisfaction created by the methods employed inin dilution,  and men resort to every possible device to seekaxemption.    In Wales eleven Tribunals have refused to continuetheir functions on the ground that elderly married men are beingtaken while young men are left in civil life.          Indications of the above facts appear daily in theRecruiting Inspection Reports, in letters of pretest receivedfrom local Tribunals, in the dally secret Keports of LabourUnrest, and lastly in the first  report of a &quot;Workmen&apos;s andSoldiers1 Committee&quot;, which was  in process of formation in oneof the Brigades in England.  (I  have dealt with and settled thisparticular matter).          Hitherto, my Recruiting Branch has generally been ableto make a rough forecast &amp;m month to month of what thesucceeding month-would produce in the way of recruits, but wehave now arrived at a time when it is impossible to form anyestimate, in view of the ever changing instructio&amp;s which arereceived in regard to recruiting from time to time.          At the present moment  the following employments areclosed to the Army     Agriculture                  Timber cutters (with some minor     Ship-building.                      exceptions).     Marine Engineering.          Fishermen (Practically entirely)     All skilled metal workers.    Mercantile Marine and others.     Steel Producers, etc.and at the moment there ig a movement on foot to close &quot;One-man&quot;businesses to the Recruiting machine.          Prom this it is evident that there is practically noreservoir to draw on except the various fixed quotas fromGovernment Departments,, which ao far have not materialised toany appreciable extent.   (I except from this remark police, civilservants and railways, the combined nuxsbers of which are verysmall). ;          I do not wish to touch on the increasing difficultieswhich the shrinking of the reservoir and the complications ef the
DERBY,17th July.1917 zaachine cause  daily to  those  eaagged in  recruiting,  but I must  point out  that the  Recruiting Officer,! instead of being,  as:&apos;formerly,  under  the voluntary ej4tem, a popular official  throughout the  country  is nMfheia up to scorn in the pre ss,  an d blamed by all who- are  tuiac^uatobed^  with the  real facts of the case, for mistakes which are absolutely unavoidable, with  the complexity ef the work upon  which he  is  engaged,  and it follows that  the Army as a  whole suffers  very much  in; public opinion.      I must again  emphasise  my opinion  that if  it is decided that recruits in sufficient  numbers are  necessary for the upkeep of the forces  ih  the  field,  the only  satis- factory method is the calling up of  all  men of certain ages  without any exception beyond that granted on physical  grounds,  or by appeal  on  personal grounds to  a  Tribunal. $hat  such  a  move ?;ould  be  popular and possible is evidenced by the  constant communications received  in my  Department  . from  all classes throughout.the country.      There  is  one  further point, and that  is, the supply of skilled workmen  for  the. Army, of which  at the present moment  7,142 are required. ,      The  demands by the Army for skilled  men, owing 1o the expansion  of the Royal Flying Corps. Tank  Corps, the requirements of the  Artillery, the Hallway Operating Divisions, and  Inland Water Transport, naturally increase, and the difficulty  of securing highly skilled men is aceen- tuated  by.the  various Government agreements and  decisions affecting  these classes. .      The  Army is being constantly &quot;combed&quot; to  ind these men but. this process has its limitations,  as will be appreciated  v&amp;en I say  that early in the current year the number  of men &quot;combed out&quot; and passing through Woolwich averaged between 1,500  and 2,000 a week,  whereas to-day the numbers  are with difficulty, maintained at about 900, and this will drop  to a much lower figure in thenear future. ;                             w
