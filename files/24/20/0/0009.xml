In view of the difficulty of deciding in cases  ofmental disease whether the disability arises from service,  aconference was held at the Ilinistry on the 13th instantunder the Chataianship of Sir Arthur Griffith Boscawen, andattended by the President of the Royal College  of Physiciansrepresentatives of the English and Scottish Boards  of Controland of the ilavy and Army lledical Services, and  eminentauthorities on the subject including Dr, Llaurice Craig, Lt.Col* Sir John Collie, Dr. Bond, and the Officer CoimandingD. Block Wet ley H^o^tal,;;^                  An interesting discussion was the result,mainly tending to show hoi? difficult it was to  say  that mentaldisease in its various forms was not caused or  aggravated oraccelerated by service,  and the general trend of opinion wasin favour of regarding it as occasioned not merely   by  specialshock, but by the mere change of environment involved inentering one of the fighting forces.            *A small sub-committee of expei-ts was appointed  to draw  up aformula for the  uidance of Medical Boards.8,     The Statutory Comrittee issued on the 12th  instanttheir ci rcui ar Ho, 55 [Append j x VI), calling attention   tothe  action  required cf  IocsL Coimnittees in consequence ofthe  ArrayCouncil Instruction which  (1)  extolled to  allBoldiers discharged from the service on ^edic&amp;l grounds,                                                      the

It Is suggested           that the Ministry of Pensions should approach the           Treasury with a request that general sanction to ccmiiiui           a man1a pension for a limited period should be giveni &apos;           The Mnistry should have discretion as to the cases in           which advantage would be taken of such sanction.   In  I           certain cases of this kind It maybe desirable for a                                                      the kind ;  I           described in (b)*                                     I       (b) Casea in which a man, in spite of his dis ablement         wishes and is able to complete the training course           already begun,   ^t is suggested that in such cases           the man should be granted an alternative pension for           the remaining period of hie training only, at the end           of his training he should revert to his flat rate          ;&apos; ocnsicn.                                  ;:.&apos;       (c) Cases in which a man Is, owing to his disability         :  prevented from completing the training which was           interrupted by enlistment, and who wishes to be           trained for some other profession.  It appears that           the Ministry has power to pay for training in such           cases, and It is suggested that the ccst of trainings 1           apart from the expenses of maintaining dependants,    j           should not as a rule exceed  15C,         ; -  Certain individual oases have been dealt with in  accordance with the above suggestions which have the approval;  of the jiinlstry.                                         xo.

EXPLANATORY  NOTE  ON THE FOREGOING DRAFT  OF                       A ROYAL WARRANT.  ; -  The draft Warrant is based partly on the regulations already existing and partlyon the recent Royal: Warrant for soldiers.   :V  v&quot;- ,  -&apos;&apos;  &apos;: &quot;    -            &apos; V     A corresponding Order in Council for the Navy has been drafted in  similarterms, except to the extent that the conditions of the Naval Service require differences.                          PART  I. DISABLED OFFICERS. .           ; -    -     1. Retired pay is  granted under present regulations  to  temporary (includingSpecial. Reserve and Territorial  Force); officers &apos;. according to  the  degree - in-whichearning;capacity  is  affected, four degrees being recognised.;.   Under&quot;the&quot;proposedWarrant the retired pay will  be assessed  -according to  the  degree  of&quot; physicalimpairment oh a scale of tenths.  The  rates for the  highest degree . of  disablementare more favourable than the present rates in all  ranks (e.g., 2501. instead of  2251. fora lieutenant-colonel, and 1751. instead of 1501. for a subaltern).v  :  Officers holding, permanent,  commissions in the  Regular Army will in futurereceive, in  addition to what they are  entitled to for disability under  the Pay Warrantof 1914, an allowance varying with.the degree of their disablement.   This allowancemay also  be added  to the  pension which  an  officer has received for service  inthe ranks.&apos;:     The same pension  is to be given in future whether the disability was caused byservice or only aggravated by it.  Hitherto, only the effects of the aggravation havebeen taken into account.     Provision is made for an officer becoming disabled after the war  by service in thewar.                                    -   -...;   Temporary or acting rank is to reckon in cases of disease no less than in cases ofwounds or  injuries. .The present provisions as to officers in receiptof wound pensions  and as to officerstotally blinded in  action are retained.     2. In addition to retired pay, a disabled officer of small means  may be grantededucation allowances for his children over the age of 9  up to a maximum of 501. a yearfor  each child.  (Under the existing regulations the minimum age is  13, and  themaximum rates are 35L for boys and 251. for girls.)     3. Where a disabled officer makes application and shows that his retired pay andwound pension (if any)  are such that, with his remaining earning capacity, he cannotattain to his pre-war earnings, an alternative pension may  be given to him to make upthe  deficiency subject to a maximum of 3001. a year, plus one-half of  any pre-warearnings between  300L  and 600L a year.   This is a new provision.     4. Retired pay at temporary rates is to be given until  an officers disablement hasreached its  final condition, but the permanent pension then  awarded may not be alteredto his disadvantage.     5. If an officer declines to undergo treatment  certified to  be  necessary in  hisinterests, half the retired pay may  be withheld.     6.  An  officer certified  to  need special medical treatment in a  sanatorium,hospital, &amp;c, may receive retired pay at the rate  for the highest degree of disable-ment.  The actual necessary medical expenses of a disabled  officer may be paid upto such an  amount and  under such conditions  as  maybe determined.   An officertotally disabled and requiring the  constant attendance of. a second person may receivean allowance not exceeding 781. a year.     7. A disabled officer undergoing necessary training  may receive retired  pay atthe highest rate, and  an allowance may be made in respect of his fees.     8. Where the degree of disablement is  less than 20  per cent., or in other caseswhere it is thought more suitable, a gratuity may be granted, in no  case exceeding
     9. Where an officer is invalided-out.-of the Army for medical unfitness, which is neither attributable to nor aggravated&apos;by military service, a gratuity may be granted &quot;him,-&quot;which in exceptionar circumstances may be as ;m.uch as 300/,.:  Under present &quot;regulations the grant is limited to three months&apos; pay and does not1 include disabilities contracted &quot;before entering service! -     -&apos;          --....*   -       .  i -y.-..  -               yvi^irrii-relatives.  ;   &apos;  :              f  r.; &apos;-&apos;  :  10. The provision-of the Pay Warrant making the pensions ;of officers&apos; relatives a reward for the officers service and dependent on their own worthiness, is retained.:     11 and 12.  The  existing  scheme  of three grades  of  widows&apos;  pensions,  the &quot;highest,&quot;  the &quot;intermediate,&quot; and the &quot;ordinary,&quot; is  retained, but the cases coming in the several categories are re-grouped, with the result that certain kinds of cases are, raised to  a higher grade.:  Thus, where an officer  dies of illness due to fatigue, privation, or  exposure incident  to active operations  in the field,  or from injuries received  in the performance of military duty, his widow will  in future receive  the &quot;highest&quot; instead of the &quot;intermediate&quot; rate; and. where death was due to disease aggravated  by service or caused by injuries attributable to service (not  coming within the  above terms), she will receive the  &quot;intermediate&quot;  instead of  the &quot;ordinary&quot; rate or a  gratuity.                   -                   .     The  existing  rates of widows&apos; pensions and children&apos;s  allowances are considered sufficiently  liberal, but the  opportunity has  been taken to grade the  rates for  the different ranks of  General Officers.     The  age for education allowances, granted in cases of pecuniary need, is reduced from 13 to 9, and the maximum grant increased to 35Z.  a year for girls.     Widows will  receive gratuities in addition to pension for  themselves and their children under the same terms as at present.     Invalid children are specially provided for as at present.     13. In  circumstances similar to those in which an  alternative  pension may be granted to a disabled  officer one  may be awarded to  the widow of a deceased &quot;officer equal  to  half  the  amount which would  have been granted to  him  had he lost all earning capacity.   The maximum pension would be 225/,.     14. Where the officer&apos;s  death is not due to disease attributable to or aggravated by service, his widow may be granted a gratuity of from one to three years&apos; pay if  she is not  eligible for  the&quot; ordinary &quot;pension (granted bythe War Office) owing  to  the shortness of the officers service.  This is  an existing  provision, except that cases of aggravation w&apos;ill in future be qualified for &quot;highest&quot; or &quot;intermediate &quot; pension.     15.  A  widow  who  re-marries  may have her  pension  restored  on second widowhood; but  it is proposed, to require in future  that her pecuniary circumstances justify the restoration.     16. It is proposed,  under proper safeguards that  will prevent an  abuse of  the indulgence, to allow the widow of a disabled officer who has   been in receipt of a disablement pension of not less  than 70Z. a  year, one-half of his  pension.   This is a new provision.     17. Special provision for motherless children, which was omitted from  the 1915 Warrant on the recommendation of the Select Committee, is re-introduced.     18. The regulations for the relatives, other than widow and children, of a  deceased officer are considerably extended and relaxed, subject to certain general conditions.     19. The parents of an officer may in future be granted a pension even though the father may be living  and not totally incapacitated, and  even though  there was  no actual pre-war dependence.  Where such dependence existed, it  will be the primary basis of the pension, but the pension may be granted  or may  be  increased having regard to the infirmity, age, need, and other circumstances of the parents.     20. Where no pension, can be granted to the parents, a gratuity not exceeding one year&apos;s widow&apos;s pension may be given.                                :i     21. The conditions as to pensions for sisters are also to be considerably relaxed, and young or invalid brothers are to bo eligible.     22. Where no pensions can  be  given  to  sisters or brothers,  gratuities not exceeding half a year&apos;s widow&apos;s pension may be granted.-    The other dependants of  officers  promoted from the  ranks  during  the war may have any  benefits they could have got if the officer had not been promoted.

The provisions for nurses follow generally those for officers, and are on a very  rmuch more liberal scale than  the  existing regulations.: Thus, a Staff Nurse totally  &apos;-disabled through war service  will receive 100L  a year, as  compared with .40L  atpresent; and there are special grants for sanatorium or hospital treatment, fortraining, for medical expenses,  and for constant attendance.     A. nurse, disabled from unfitness, not attributable  to or aggravated by service,may receive a gratuity which in exceptional circumstances may amount to 200L  Thepresent regulations allow only three months&apos; pay.

Chief Actuary to the National  Health Insurance  Joint Committee.To the Right Honourable G-.  N. BARNES, M.P., Minister of Pensions.SIR,&apos;&quot; -            ,.       . -             &apos;H   - -       .   ^   -          ;&apos;      1. IN compliance with  your request  I have made an investigation with regardto the probable cost of retired pay and gratuities to disabled officers of the Army, andpensions and gratuities to widows and other dependants of officers, and to disablednurses, as set out in the draft  Royal  Warrant.    2. It is evident that the  liability  of  the Government  in  respect of all WarPensions, &amp;c. must be very largely governed by the duration of hostilities and theextent of the casualties, as to which,  in the nature of the case, nothing can be foretold.Calculations in regard to officers might be made on various hypothetical bases ;  but,as in the case of  non-commissioned officers and men, I have  thought it sufficient atthis  stage to limit myself to one  basis and  to  exhibit the estimated cost on theassumption that the total number of  casualties of all kinds is to be obtained by addingto the number which occurred up  to 31st  December 1916 a  number equal to thosewhich occurred during  the year  1916.   In certain other  respects also the liabilitydepends upon conditions  for the measurement of&apos; which no definite  statistical basiscan be found, and  the estimates  should not be regarded, therefore, as affording morethan a general indication of the charge which is likely to arise.    3. As far.as possible the bases of  calculation adopted in the case of men, asreferred to in my  reports of November 1914 (Cd. 7662) and February 1917 (Cd. 8485),have been employed.  Married officers are  found, however, to be under 20 per cent.of the total number of officers as  against 33 per cent, in the case of the  non-com-missioned ranks, while the average  number of children to  each married officer is 1*4as against an average of -2 to married men among the lower ranks.   Due effect hasbeen given to these and other  variations in the circumstances of the two classes.    4. Subject to the qualifications above mentioned, I estimate the maximum annualcharge  in respect  of  retired  pay  and  pensions  to be   1,600,000,  made up asfollows :-                                                                            Disabled officers-      -      - v    -      -  900,000             Widows and children   -      -      -. \    -  650,000             Other dependants      -      -      -      -   40,000             Nurses  -      -      -             -      -   10,000 1,600,000This amount corresponds with the sum of  25,000,000 which I have  estimated tobe the maximum annual charge in the case of non-commissioned officers and men.  Inview, however, of the extent to which wounded  officers who have&apos; suffered  permanentinjuries of a character such as to entitle them to retired pay under the Warrant arebeing retained in the Army, either for active service or for light duty, there is  someroom for doubt as to the time which must elapse, following the cessation of hostilities,before the maximum charge is reached.-    5.  In addition to the charges for retired pay and pensions, provision has to beincluded for gratuities payable, in various circunistances.  These  gratuities  dependupon the discretion of the Minister of Pensions, exercised in pursuance of a  generalpolicy indicated by the Warrant,  and it is hardly,possible to do more, therefore, than

On  such calculations as the case admits  of laminclined to think that  750,000 is a reasonable sum to include under this head.     6. The capitalised value of the pensions and  gratuities, being the sum which, if   (invested at 4 per cent, (free of income tax), would  provide all the charges and becomeexhausted with  the death of the last  surviving  pensioner is estimated, roundly, atThirty Million pounds ( 30,000,000).                 -                         I am, Sir,                &apos;   .;   &apos;  .     -    .

Thg Mayor of Leicester and Lieutenant Colonel   Clark attended for the purpose of obtaining information with   regard toa propos ed Schemev at Leicester f or the application  - of the fund raised locally for the benefit of Leicester men   broken in tho Y/ar.                     &apos; -             Sir A* Boscawen;explained the objects and functions -   of the Institutional Committee.   The Mayor stated that the . .Leicester fund was raised primarily to extend assistance to   Leicester men by supplementing any Statutory provision under   which they would benefit..  , His Committee considered; that there :  : were numerous cases of discharged men v/ho were  in outside   employment and found themselves incapable of carrying on   without receiving further treatment.           /- Lieutenant Colonel Clark had drawn his Committee&apos;s  , attention 10 the Institutional Committee which - had been set   up. and he desired to know how far this Committee would deal   with such institutions.           :  The feeling of Leicester was that they were desirous   of providing something extra to that provided by the   State *             Lieutenant Colonel--:Clark asked that he be furnished                   : v,:-&apos;v;-; dealing with outpatient treatment   with a copy of an  Army Council Instruction/which he  referred   to and discussed the position generally and Orthopaedic treatment   in particular v/ith regard to men who are already in outside  &quot;   employment.                                      that             Sir ju Boscav/en explained/the Army Council                                                   Instruction
Instruction referred to was Intended only to apply so faras there was accommodation existing and pointed out thatthe Leicester Committee night apply certain of their fundsin payment of the initial expense of establishing andequipping buildings etc. for one purpose of dealing without-patient cases for which there was no room in theMilitary Hospital.  The general principle was that wherelocal funds were available the initial expenditure in con-nection with suitable buildings should be met out of them,and the State only approached as a last resort.          Mr. Stanley put it that the State provides forthe maintenance and private or Red Cross funds the initialoutlay.          The Mayor of Leicester asked that a letter bewritten to him on the lines that where locai funds wereavailable it was regular and advisable that such fundsshould be applied in initial expenditure in connection withsuitable buildings and that the State would not interveneto provide such new Institutions unless no other fund wasavailable.          Sir Arthur Boscawen spoke of the necessity forInstitutions to provide for the care and treatment ofserious shell shock or Neurasthenic cases.  One suchInstitutionswith from sixty to seventy beds was certainlyrequired in the Midlands and part of the money could bewell applied in that direction.           A building with a large number of rooms and ;extensile groundu near Leicester was mentioned as asuitable plafe ar. ii, coula pi&apos;uvidc about 58 beds.          ; Sir A; Bo3oawon \^ndertook to ask Sir John Collieto visit Leicester and inspect the buildi ng mentioned.
          The Mayor dosired that the Mayors Fund Committeeshould if possibid take over the. Management of anyinstitution that might be established with Local Funds.3,  Paraplegics .  Dr. Fox Symons reported that since theSummary submitted on the 28th June 1917, 79 cases had been dealtwith and that there were 74 additional patients notified forJune, the re turns for which were no t ye t comple te *   The ro wasatme difficulty in dealing with men who declined accommodationbecause deductions were made from their pension, and were kepton in Military Hospitals after their discharge from the Army,In some cases after a prolonged stay in a Military Hospital aman does not like being transferred to another place and thatwas a difficulty which needed attention.          It was dec ided to recommend that the Ministry shouldwrite to the War Office suggesting that all paraplegic casesshould be reported and thart an enquiry should be made as towhether there was a stoppage from pension made in the case ofdischarged men in Military Hospitals.4.&apos;   War Seal Foundation.   In connection with this schemainstituted by Mr. Oswald Stoll a minute by Sir Matthew Nathanwas read and also a letter from the Secretary of the Schema tothe Ministry,   It appeared in the letter that certain paraplegiccases were already being dealt with.    The position Y/as discussedgenerally and the whole of the papers were handed to Dr. FoxSymons for the purpose of perusal and furnishing a report.5.   Dr.  Fox Symons reported that he  had had an interview withLady Anne Kerr with reference  to the  erection of a home fordisabled soldiers and Bailors  (paraplegics)  and that the papersin connection with the house at Sunningdale  had been sent on toSir&apos;; John Collle*6*   Llngfiold   Mr.  Stanley reported that he had gone  throughthe figures In connection with the cost of the  Building and thatMr. Masdan was coming up to see him on Friday the 13th  July.^  fpavid Lewis  Colony.

Westminster House,                                            Millbank,                                                LONDON, S.T?.l                                          13th July 1917.Dear Mr. Kay or,               With reference to the conversation you hadyesterday with Sir Matthew Nathan and the Joint InstitutionalCommittee respecting the fund which has been do generouslysubscribed at Leicester for disabled soldiers and sailors,X am writing to confirm what I suggested, viz., that partof the money could not be better applied than in theprovision of certain institutions where discharged men canobtain furtter medical and Surgical treatment where necessary              By &quot;provision&quot; I mean the initial out-lay orcapital, expenditure only, l.e. the erection of an institutionor better the renting of a suitable house or houses, andtheir adaptation and equipment as hospitals.  The entire costof the treatment and maintenance would be borne by theMinistry of Pensions in accordance with the terms of Article6 of the new Royal Warrant on a capitation basis, and themen while undergoing treatment Tfould receive the liberalallowances for themselves and their families indicated inthat article.              It may be asked why if the Ministry providethe maintenance they do not also provide the initial capitalexpenditure-  The answer is that theoretically they arebound to do so to the best of their ability and they do notshirk the responsibility, and way have to undertake it incertain cases,  But in practice they have found it best                                                         toHis Worship the Mayor&apos;of Leicester,         Town Hall,               LEICESTER
...... .. , V I TIIIIIIIIIIHIWII..........Ill59 to avail themselves of local funds, where  such exist,  and of money generously subscribed to the Red Cross  Society1 s funds in other cases *   Ifeere are several reasons for  this and among them the following;-     1,   Th* further treatment (or training) of disabled soldiers and sailors is &amp; temporary matter, not  likely to last for long after the war in most cases, and  it  is  not expedient that the State should set up a large number of institutions for such purposes, which would become useless to it  in a few years time.   On the other hand, institutions set up by Local and voluntary funds and used temporarily for  State purposes may veryllfctely be converted to useful local  purposes  after&apos; the - war.     2.   We think that voluntary local control  is likely.-to be more effective in most cases than central  control from a government off ice. .7,y     3.   Time is an essential factor.   A large number of such institutions are wanted immediately and  if  we endeavour to provide them all as a government department it is very unlikely that we should be able to cover the country as quickly as we can by availing ourselves of voluntary and local help.     4.   We are really aeting in the same manner as the War Office has done in respect of Auxiliary Hospitals which hav* been set up all over the country by voluntary funds, the State afterwards providing, or at least contributing to, the maintenance.   Without the generous assistance thus given it would have been impossible to provide sufficient beds  for the funded and convalescent soldiers and sailors atvthe beginning of  the war.&apos;;.          I think therefore that you may fairly  say that in providing such institutions out of your local fund at  Leicester you will be doing work which could not otherwise be done to  the same advantage of tbe soldiers and sailors of your Borough,  and you will certainly be helping the Ministry of Pension very       v                                        materially.
 materially..: -      V   With regard to the two projects which we discussedyesterday, viz. the institutions for out-patients and a &quot;Homeof Recovery&quot; for serious shell-shoe^ cases, I should like to sayas regards the former that I understand the intention of therecent Army Council Instruction iras that outrpatient treatmentwould be given at Military Hospitals only so far as there wasexisting accommodation.   If therefore accommodation at theLeicester Military Hoapital^s Vinsufficlent and that there are1ikely to be a large number of case s from thtf Borough andneighbourhood, an institution especially adapted and equippedfor the purpose would certainly be very useful,   The questionof providing a hostel for those who come from some distance toget the treatment might also be considered.   As regards the&quot;Home of Recovery&quot; there is an undoubted need of such a place,similar to the one recently opened at Golders Green, in theMidlands, and though this would probably serve a larger districtthan Leicester and Leicestershire it would be arranged thatLeicester and Leicestershire men should have a prior claim to .go there over others.   I have asked Sir John Collie, who is ourDirector of Neurasthenic Institutions, to visit Leicester shortlyand to discuss the matter with you.          I hope that this letter explains most of the questionswhich you aBked me yesterday, and I desire to add that Mr,  Barnesappreciates very much the splendid generosity with which thepeople of Leicester have responded to your appeal on behalf of,the discharged disabled soldierg and 3ailorc of the district.                          Believe me,                              Yours very faithfully,                (signed)            A. G.  Boscawen.

I am directed by the War Pensions, &amp;c, Statutory Committee to refer to their  Circular of the 5th April, No. 35, and to Army Council Instruction 449, of 1917, - which was forwarded therewith.      A further Army Council Instruction, No. 795, of 1917,  has since been issued.  Copies have been sent  to  you,  and it will be seen that the provisions of Army  -Council Instruction 449  have been extended to all soldiers discharged from  the  service upon medical grounds, whether they are discharged from a hospital or from  a Command Depot  or other unit.  In  order that the  existing organisation of  visitors may be extended to all places from which men  are about to be discharged,  it will be necessary for Local Committees to appoint visitors to represent them,  and to interview men about to  be discharged from  the  Service,  not  only in  Military Hospitals and Auxiliary  and V.A.D. Hospitals (as explained in Circular  35), but also  at Command and Regimental Depots.                                 TREATMENT.      It will be seen from paragraphs  of  Army  Council Instruction  No. 795 that  Officers in Charge of Hospitals, or Presidents of Travelling or Invahding Boards,  as the case may be, will  distinguish  upon Army  Form  W. 3555  between  (a)i  cases  wliich require out-door treatment at  a Military  Orthopaedic Hospital andI (b) those which can be dealt with satisfactorily at a civil or military general hospital.I The form  will be sent to the Local Committee  concerned.   Where it is marked%&quot; Orthopaedic  A&quot; it will  be necessary for  application to be made to the Ministry &apos; of Pensions in order that  arrangements  may be made for treatment to be obtained  at one of the  following orthopaedic centres:           Military Orthopaedic Hospital, Ducane Road, Shepherd&apos;s Bush, London, W.          Alder Hey Auxiliary Hospital, Liverpool.          Welsh Metropolitan War Hospital, Whitchurch, near Cardiff.          2nd Northern General Hospital, Becketts Park, Leeds.

Scottish National Red Cross Hospital, Bellahoustan,  Glasgow, N.B.         Ulster Volunteer  Force Hospital, Belfast; or,     ;   V         Military Orthopaedic Hospital, Blackrock, Dublin.      Other orthopaedic centres are in course of completion, and these will be notified  to Local Committees from time to time.      Where, however,  Army Form W. 3555 is  marked  &quot; Orthopaedic  B &quot; the  necessary treatment should be obtained at a civil or military general hospital having  an orthopaedic section, and  in order to  ascertain  the names of  such institutions in  their neighbourhood Local Committees should make enquiries of the Deputy Director  of Medical Services of the Command in which they are situated.

Where special arrangements for a class or course of  instruction for disabled men are proposed to be made the  fees payable  shall represent  the  additional expenditure -only incurred thereby, exclusive of all standing charges  in respect of  the  institution, and in  any case shall not  exceed 7s. 6d. per head per week, except with the sanction -of the Minister of Pensions.   5. Where a Joint Committee has been set up by two or  more Local  Committees for the  purpose of advising on or  concerting  schemes of treatment or training, the Local Committee should  at a convenient stage  consult the Joint Committee  in regard  to their proposals  before submitting them to the Minister of Pensions for approval.   6.

 NOTES ON TREATMENT AND  TRAINING. Gases for which treatment or  training may be provided,   -    , under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant.  Article 6 of the Royal Warrant and Order in  Council provides for the special medical treatment and training of discharged disabled men whose disablement is determined by Hie Minister of Pensions to  be due to or aggravated  by naval or military service in thi present war.   The Local Committee should regard themselves as responsible for all  discharged  men of this class living in  their area. They should  make it  their business to  get  in  touch with  every such  man, whether  or  not he has obtained employment  or occupation since his  discharge,  and see that the treatment or training which his  condition needs is.secured for him when he needs it.  Many men are able very readily at the present time to obtain employment  oE one kind or another, but such employment may, owing to their  physical condition be actually detrimental  to their permanent health.  Others may drift into occupations  in which their employment may only be temporary, whereas if  they had  received training for  a  skilled occupation they would have the prospect of permanent employment. It is vitally important both in  the  man&apos;s interest and  in that of the nation that any  case  which nelds either treatment or training should be taken in hand at once. Local Committees  must not  be content  with  dealing only with the men who happen to present themselves  to them for assistance ; they must see that they have infor- mation as to the condition of all discharged pensioners in their areas, and make a point of  getting in touch with themdirectly they are discharged.  Local Committees are now furnished with full infor-mation as to  their discharged  disabled men (a)  by the Form 3463  sent from the military  hospital from whichthe man is discharged giving all  general informationabout the. man ; (b) by the Form^lS/S, or  Form N. 230,issued from  the  Ministry, as  to the  man&apos;s  pension orgratuity ;  (c) by  the white card, Army Form W. 3555,issued  from the  military hospital, which  indicates thefurther treatment, if any, that  is needed ; and (d) by theReport made  by the hospital visitor  as to the suitabilityof the man for training on discharge.
  The  discharged  man, also, is now fully informed ofwhat to do  if he  needs help. &apos; He is instructed  on dis-charge as to  (a)  placing  himself  in: touch  with hisApproved Society  and the Insurance Committee of theCounty or County Borough in which he lives in  orderthat he may  obtain his benefits as an insured person, andkeep up his insurance;  and (b) communicating  withhis Local Committee in case he needs information  as tohis pension or as to treatment or training.  Arrangementsare, moreover, now being made to issue to each  man on asingle  card, which  he will permanently retain, all the in-f ormation he requires as a part of his Discharge Certificate.For men  discharged before the  present arrangementscame into force, the poster issued for display in all PostOffices should be a useful guide and Local  Committeesshould see that the  poster is properly exhibited in alllikely  places.   At the same  time the Local Committeeshould not rely on  this alone, but should take the initiativethrough their visitors and assistants, to get in touch withthese men.   Difficulty has often been experienced in thepast, in inducing men to undertake, or to persevere in thetreatment or training offered them.   But the allowancesprovided in cases of treatment or training are now suffi-ciently generous to  remove  all fear of  the man or hiefamily suffering while he is undergoing either.  See as tothe scale of allowances Instruction 31.  On the other hand,the liability  to forfeiture of one-half the pension in a casewhere treatment is refused, as provided in Article 4 of theRoyal  Warrant, should operate to secure the acceptance oftreatment wherever it is  clearly and reasonably requiredin the  man&apos;s interest.                     .&quot;. Gases  NOT Covered by Article 6 of the Royal  Warrant.  Article 6 of the Royal Warrant does not apply to men dis-  -charged on account of incapacity which is not determinedby the Minister to be due to, or aggravated by, their warservice.  Under the  former Royal Warrants such caseswere either given a temporary pension of 4s. 8d.,-6r ahigher sum  (in accordance with their rank) if the lengthof  their military  service  justified  it,  but if  not, theyreceived neither gratuity nor pension. Under Article 7 (2)of  the new Warrant all  such cases  are given  a.gratuity
which, is based mainly  on the ascertained degree of theman&apos;s incapacity:      ...; -  These cases  will not  be eligible for treatment  andtraining with the full allowances payable under Article 6,but the Minister has been able; under the sanction of theTreasury, to secure treatment (not training)  for  thesecases  where the incapacity which necessitates  treatmentis connected with the incapacity for which the man wasdischarged from military service.  It will be recognised that  where  a man is dischargedfor incapacity which is clearly in no way connected  withhis military  service he  cannot be  placed on  the  samefooting and entitled to the same privileges as a man whohas been injured by his war  seiwice, and this distinctionhas been recognised   both in the  Regulations of  theStatutory Committee  and in the  Royal  Warrant.   Indealing with such cases,  however, it will be open to theLocal Committee to represent to the  Minister any  casewhich  has been  refused a   disability pension, if   themedical and  other evidence  in their opinion seems topoint to the conclusion either that the first decision wasarrived at  without full  knowledge of the facts, or  thatan incapacity which becomes serious some time after theman&apos;s discharge really originated in, or was aggravatedby, his military service, and the Minister is  prepared,acting under Article 9  of the Royal Warrant, to give fulland sympathetic consideration to any representations somade.  Subject to this,  a Local Committee should re-member-^)  that treatment  may be provided  and  theexpense of such treatment defrayed under Articles 5 to15 of the Instructions, but the allowances provided forunder Instructions &apos;6&apos;i to  40 will not be payable ; (b) thatthe gratuity payable to  the man under  Article 7  (2) ofthe Royal Warrant may be paid in the form of a weeklyallowance if the Local  Committee  so  recommend, andthey should, in all cases recommend this where continuedtreatment is necessary ; (c) that in any case where specialcircumstances of hardship render further assistance neces-sary during treatment, the matter is one for considerationunder the Regulations of the  Statutory Committee.   -
              \;:.  TREATMENT.             General Practitioner Treatment.   Insured men are already entitled under the National Insurance Act, 1911, in all parts of the Kingdom except Ireland, to &quot; medical benefit,&quot; that is, to the services of a general practitioner  and  to the  necessary  supply of medicines,  &amp;c.;  and  the National Insurance  (Part  I. Amendment) Act, 1917, recently  passed, empowers the Insurance Commissioners  to extend this provision to- invalided  sailors  and  soldiers  who for any  reason are uninsured upon discharge.   Upon completion, therefore, of the arrangements now  being  made  by the Commis- sioners, all invalided sailors and soldiers, whether insured or not, excepting only those uninsured men whose income exceeds  160 per  annum, will  be entitled  under the Insurance Acts to free medical attendance from a general practitioner  and to the necessary supply of medicines, &amp;c. Negotiations are in progress for the extension of medical benefit to discharged disabled men in Ireland.   Moreover, special machinery is being  instituted by the Commissioners in  co-operation  with  the  Ministry  of Pensions whereby,  prior  to  a man&apos;s discharge, the In- surance Committee for the area in which he proposes to live will  be automatically notified of  his  impending discharge, and thus enabled to take special steps to put him in the way of obtaining the treatment available for him.               Special Medical Treatment.   General practitioner treatment being  thus secured for the discharged disabled  man Article 6  of the Warrant is intended to provide him- any special treatment that his disablement may from time to time require, and that the Local Committee  may, on the certificate of a  competent medical man, provide for  him.   Special treatment, and the allowances provided for when such treatment is given, cannot be provided for any incapacity.which is not due to or connected with the man&apos;s disablement.&apos;., ,  .  .&apos;.       Medical Certificate necessary.   Before they can provide special treatment of any kind, .whether the case is one that appears only to need convales- ,-cent treatment or is  a  serious surgical case, the  Local
Committee must be satisfied on medical evidence as to -thenature of the man&apos;s incapacity,  its connection with hisdisablement, the kind  of treatment necessary and, so faras possible, the period of treatment required.   (a) Cases needing treatment on discharge. The whitecard Army Form W. 3555, which is already in every casesent to the Local Committee of the man&apos;s place of residencewill, in accordance with an Army Council Instruction aboutto be issued at the instance  of the Minister of Pensions, beextended so as to give the  Committee a certificate in theform required by Instruction 10.   It will  be  the  duty ofthe Committee to act immediately on  receipt of this andto use their utmost endeavour to induce the man to acceptthe treatment prescribed.   (b)  Cases arising after discharge. Many of these caseswill  automatically come under medical review when  atthe end of the period of a conditional pension they comebefore a Medical Board.  Where the Board finds that a manneeds treatment they will  certify accordingly, and treat- ment will be arranged  for either by the Ministry or by theLocal Committee who will be notified by the Ministrvi   The Local  Committee will, however,  find  many casesneeding treatment in the interval between  one officialmedical  examination and another, or among men who havebeen awarded a final pension, and for these cases the Local Committee must  obtain medical examination and theappropriate treatment.  In order to  secure that  as far as possible every case is referred at once to the suitable insti-tution where the  man may  be medically  or surgicallytreated, it is necessary that  not only should the variousinstitutions, military and  civil, be classified but  that thecases themselves should be sorted.  The latter will be the work of the Medical Referee.   Medical Referees will be appointed for all districts as soon  as possible, and their  names and the districts for which they will act will be notified from time to time to the Local Committee.  Pending their appointment the Local Committee should obtain  certificates in accordance with their present practice.  Where a Medical  Referee has been  appointed, the normal  procedure will be that  an applicant  for treatment to  a Local  Committee or to a District or Sub-Committee will be referred at once to the
Medical Referee, whose duty it will be to satisfy himselfin the first instance that the incapacity from which theman is suffering is, so far as can reasonably be ascertained,connected with his disablement.  . For  this purpose theMedical Referee  should  be furnished by the  Committeewith  a copy  of any  official medical  report from  theMinistry or  otherwise  (e.g., Form  3463) which they mayhave.  At the same time the man should be  questionedon this point  and it  should  be remembered  in thisconnection that by the  Regulations of the InsuranceCommissioners it is the duty of the panel doctor to advisehis patient as to the steps to be taken in order to securesuch  treatment, beyond  the competence of an ordinarypractitioner, as his condition requires.  When the Referee is satisfied  as to the case he will    (ft) if he finds that the  case  is one of ivound or injury        for which surgical  treatment  in a  hospital is        necessary, send  the  man  to a military  hospital,        and the medical officer in charge will  then  either        accept the man as a patient (in or out) or recom-        mend the proper institution or treatment for him,        and he will in either  case give the Local  Com-        mittee the certificate required by Instruction 10 ;    (b) if he finds that the case is not one of wound  or       &quot; injury but should be  treated in or at a general        or special  (civil) hospital, he will refer the case    ... to the appropriate  hospital; or    (c) in certain cases he will himself be able to give        the full certificate necessary, e.g., in cases needing        convalescent treatment, or he will simply certify        that home treatment is required, and  that the        man should be referred to his&apos; panel doctor if he        considers that the case  does not require more        than  the general practitioner should  be able  to        give.  If the  Referee finds that the case is one to  be referredto  an institution for examination  and treatment,  heshould, on behalf of the Committee, give the man a cardof Recommendation (to be supplied by the Local  Com-mittee) stating the nature  of the incapacity from whichhe  finds  the man to be suffering and that in his opinion,so far as  he can  judge, it is consequent on  the man&apos;sdisablement..
  Instruction 12 allows of two exceptions to the generalrule reqiring examination  of the men by  the MedicalReferee  before  treatment  is : given,  namely, (a) casesrequiring immediate and urgent  treatment, and (6) casesin which unnecessary delay  or inconvenience  would becaused by  requiring  the  man to be  examined by theMedical Referee.   Even in these cases  reference by letteror other communication to the Referee for  advice as tothe case  must be made, but the  power to deal  thus ex-ceptionally with  cases should be sparingly used.  Therewill,  however, be cases, e.g., of an obvious  wound orinjury, or where the unhealed stump of a limb requiresattention, in which the man can be sent to the  properinstitution  without the delay that would occur  if theman were first required to be personally examined by theMedical Referee.  Forms of Certificate. The necessary form of certificatefor the purpose  of Instruction 7  should be supplied byLocal Committees to Medical Referees and the  necessarysupply of copies will be furnished by the Ministry. TheMilitary hospitals will  be supplied centrally.           Arrangements  with Institutions.  Before any arrangements, can be made with Institutionsthe Local Committee will have to ascertain (so far as theyhave not already done so) the several classes of institutionavailable for their use. On  this  point see Instruction 8.The Medical Members of the Local Committee or  of theDisablement Committee, will, it is hoped, render assist-ance in this direction, and particularly in connection withany communication necessary with the Deputy Directorof  Medical Services  in  regard  to  the classification ofMilitary  Hospitals.   The  Local Director in charge ofAuxiliary Hospitals in or  near the area should similarlybe  approached in  regard to the  terms on which suchhospitals can be  used, and the classes of case for  whichthey are  suitable.   It must be remembered also in thisconnexion  that  the Joint Committee, if one  has beenestablished embracing the area of the  Local Committee, -has as one of its principal duties that of ascertaining theinstitutional facilities of its area, and the Local Committeeshould act closely in touch with the Joint Committee.
    Men may be sent to Military Hospitals in the case of wound  or  injury  without previous ; sanction by  the Minister.  Instruction 6 also allows the Local Committee to make arrangements with certain of the larger and fully equipped civil  hospitals  specified in  that Instruction without previous sanction by the Minister, but all arrange- ments proposed with other hospitals  of any other kind must be submitted  for approval.   Further,  Instruction 8 requires that a statement  shall.as soon  as.possible be submitted by every Local  Committee (except where they have already submitted such a statement to  the Statutory Committee) for  approval to the  Ministry, setting  out in detail the hospitals and Institnti ns with which the Local Committee have made or propose to make arrangements.                   Nature of treatment.    The cases requiring treatment will be  (a)  those  suffer- ing from wounds  and injuries special to war service for which further treatment in or at  an institution may be advisable, and which should, as  already indicated, be treated wherever  possible, at a military hospital, because of the special facilities at present  existing in  the  equip- ment of these institutions  and in the  experience of this class of case possessed by the staff attached to them ;  and (&amp;) medical cases of disease, mostly not. attributable to but aggravated  by War  Service, and  for these,  while home treatment such aB the panel practitioner under the National Insurance Acts can give is  ordinarily sufficient, specialist treatment may in  some cases be necessary.  In these cases the special treatment required  should wherever possible be given in or at a civil  hospital, whether a general or a special hospital, unless of course the treatment is no more,* than the general practitioner can give and would ordinarily be required to give.:          -        Provision of&quot;treatment.    Where the treatment prescribed is more than the general practitioner can  give it will  in  nearly all cases have to be arranged for by the Local Committee with a Military hospital or other  institution,  either in  its  own area or  outside it, but in certain cases  arrangements  will be made  otherwise than by the Local Committee for  obtaining the  treatment  required and in others  the  Ministry can give the Local Committee assistance to obtain it:
   1. Cases in which, the arrangements in individual cases for  treatment  will be made  otherwise  than by Local Committees are :      (a) Cases of tuberculosis.     (&amp;) Cases of insanity.     (c) Serious cases needing surgical treatment reported        by Medical Boards on re-examination of the men        after discharge.   2. Cases in  which  the  Ministry are  in  touch with institutions for special classes of cases and may in suitable cases be able to make arrangements for treatment:      (d) Neurasthenia.     (e) Epilepsy.     (/) Paralysis (paraplegia).     (g) Cases requiring orthopaedic treatment.     (h) Cases of loss of limb.     (J) Treatment and training of the blind.   The  following  paragraphs  deal in  detail with  the arrangements to be made for each of the above classes.                   Tuberculous Cases.   The  Insurance  Commissioners and  local  Insurance Committees are primarily responsible for  securing  all necessary  treatment for cases of tuberculosis among dis- charged men,  if they are  insured under the National Insurance Acts ;  and for these cases special financial and administrative machinery have been in operation for some considerable time.   These special arrangements are now being revised and extended by the Commissioners in con- sultation with the Minister of  Pensions, and, when com- pleted will, under the provisions of the National Insurance (Part 1. Amendment) Act, 11)17, apply also to all uninsured invalided  men,  whose income does not exceed   160 a year, in whose case institutional  treatment if required on discharge is at present arranged&apos; by the Local Government Board.   The special arrangements as thus revised and  extended should therefore secure the prompt provision of whatever. treatment  the  Tuberculosis  Officer may at any time con- sider necessary for the man&apos;s case.   Special attention is also  being given  to the treatment of advanced cases of tuberculosis and the Minister of Pensions
is taking steps, in co-operation with the Local GovernmentBoard, to increase the institutional accommodation avail-able for this class of case.  -  &quot;Where a man is about to be discharged on account oftuberculosis and is in need of institutional treatment, theInsurance  Commissioners are notified, and obtain theman&apos;s  admission to an institution.   In these cases theMinistry  of Pensions will make  all allowances to theman and  to his family or dependants during treatmentand will notify the Local Committee accordingly.  When any case of tuberculosis comes to the knowledgeof the Local Committee in  which they have any reasonto  doubt  whether  a man is having  the full advantageof these special arrangements they should  communicatewith  the  Insurance Commissioners,  who will take thenecessary steps to meet the case.   In all such cases theMinistry will, when the new arrangements  are in opera-tion, be notified of the man&apos;s admission and will  pay theallowances (if any)  due  to the man and his family.  Inthe meantime the Local Committee may in any case of aman admitted to a sanatorium by an Insurance Committeesome time after discharge pay any allowances to the manand his family in accordance with Instruction 34, but anysuch payments should not continue  to be made  beyondthe date to be notified by further circular.  Subject to any further instructions  on the matter thatmay be issued, the  Local Committee  are not empoweredto provide treatment in any case  of  Tuberculosis exceptwith the sanction of the Minister of Pensions.  Difficulty may be experienced in some cases in induc-ing the man to go to an institution.   He may not realisethat his case requires treatment,  or  if it is a  case ofadvanced tuberculosis, he maybe inclined to stay at homerather than go to an institution  at  a distance from it.The Local-Committee must use their utmost persuasionin.dealing with such cases, pointing  out the penalty ofreduction of pension if the  man  refuses  the treatment.In  advanced and incurable cases  the  man should prefer-ably go to an institution, not only for  his own treatment,but because of the grave danger of infection to his family.Hospital  accommodation  for  this  class  is limited atpresent, though steps are being taken to increase it.
      .                 Insane.  The institutions available are the County and. BoroughLunatic Asylums.  Treatment  in private asylums, u li-censed  houses&quot; or  &quot; registered hospitals&quot;  cannot  begiven at the cost of  the Ministry.   Arrangements  havebeen  made with  the  Board  of  Control for England andWales by &quot;which soldiers  discharged with a  pension  onaccount of mental affection who are on discharge, or sub-sequently become certifiable shall, if sent to county  orborough asylums be  treated on  the footing of privatepatients, but in a special class by themselves  as &quot; ServicePatients &quot; on payment by the  Ministry of the ordinarycharge for maintenance and a small additional charge.A further sum of 2s. 6d a week will be allowed by theMinistry and administered by the asylum authorities tobe spent by or  for the man to secure him small  creaturecomforts.  A similar  arrangement  is  being  negotiatedwith  the  Scottish Board of Control and  with.the  IrishAuthorities. .                            .  The above-mentioned arrangements will, under Treasurysanction, apply also to. cases where the  insanity is notcertified to be  due to or  aggravated by war  service, butthe extension of the privilege is temporary and  will notapply where there  is evidence that the  man had  beenin an asylum before enlistment.  Where a man is removed  to  an asylum on dischargearrangements will be made by the Ministry, and the LocalCommittee will be notified.  When a case&apos;  arises  afterdischarge, it the man has already been removed to a poorlaw  institution  pending admission  to the asylum, theLocal Committee should (on  being  informed by theguardians or otherwise) see  that- arrangements are madeas quickly as possible for his removal from the workhouseand admission to the asylum.as a &quot;Service  Patient.&quot;  TheLocal Committee should in such cases notify the Ministryof the date of  admission  to  the  institution  and of theaddress  of the man&apos;s wife and dependants.  The Ministry will  in all  cases be responsible for  allcharges  and allowances so far as the latter are payable  inrespect of the man and his family, and the Local Committeewill not be liable to make any payments in respect of casesof insane in asylums.         .: .           :-.

As.a  rule work in some, form, at first light,encouragement and entire absence of injudicious sympathy,are more helpful in these cases than  commiseration andsupplemental allowances.  Where gratuities have beenawarded in cases of this class.no additional assistance canbe given by the  Local Committees under the Royal Warrantor these  instructions, and Local Committees are recom-inended not to  give assistance out of other funds at theirdisposal, as to.  do so will tend  to frustrate the - remedialeffect of this method of dealing with the case;    -. :  If a serious case of neurasthenia comes before the LocalCommittee it should be reported at  once to the Ministryof Pensions for  reference to the Special Medical Board,&apos;anda special examination by the Medical Board will then, ifnecessary, be arranged either In London  or in one ofthe above-mentioned towns.  Arrangements  are in  progress for  providing; a. fewHomes of Recovery for  neurasthenic, cases in  variousparts,  of.  the country. -  One  such has  been opened&apos; atGolder&apos;s  Green, Hendon, Middlesex.

disease, with, inability to  work and for certain forms ofparalysis, tremors,  stammering, or depression.   In  thecase of discharged soldiers  it frequently happens  thatslow progress has fostered a gloomy view as to the  pro-spects of cure, but in  fresh surroundings  these prospectsare often very good.  Each patient will receive individualattention in the Home, and there are workshops in whichpatients may-  have  occupation, and, if  desired, skilledinstruction.   Endeavour will be  made to find suitablework for patients when they leave.  All charges for the treatment of  men sent  to Golder&apos;sGreen,  or to similar institutions, under arrangements madeby  the  Ministry, and the allowances, if any, to  theirwives  and  families: will  be  defrayed by the Ministrydirect.        .......                    ..  Men who do not or cannot avail themselves of theseRecjvery Homes are   not suitable for treatment at  theout-patient  departments of hospitals.   They should  bereferred for special treatment to the Medical Referee, whomay, if he chooses, consult the Special Medical Board as-to treatment. -                       Epileptics.  As knowledge of this distressing and disabling maladyis still  very far from complete, its treatment is beset withdifficulty.   In ordinary cases its manifestations commencein early childhood or in the early &apos;teens, and if maintainedover a  period of years the complaint is likely to be veryresistive to treatment.  Fortunately, however, in manycases there is, with or without treatment,  an arrest of thesymptoms, but under stresses of various kinds, as has beenthe  case with a considerable number of soldiers, thesemay re-appear.  In an appreciable number of other cases,however, the malady seems to have first shown  itselfsubsequently to the man&apos;s joining the army.  It is well to realise that, in the present state of medicalknowledge, there  are no special  modes of  treatmentwhich will give safe promise of a cure after /a  shortperiod.  Patience  and perseverance are  absolutely  re-quisite to  effect  any substantial  alleviation.   As a setoff,  however,  against these  difficulties is  the  factthat, of all maladies, epilepsy is  one of those in which
treatment and training go hand in  hand, systematic out-door occupation in farm, garden and horticultural opera-tions  being  at  present  regarded  as  offering   moreencouraging results than any medical treatment.  The available  institutions specially  devoted  to the &apos;treatment of epilepsy on these lines are very few.  Thosewith which the Ministry are in touch are : (1) Chalf ontColony, St. Peters, Bucks ; (2) Lingfield Homes, Lingfi eld,Surrey;  (3) Home for Epileptics, Maghull, Liverpool; and(4)  David Lewis  Colony, Warford,  Alderley  Edge,Cheshire.  The Ministry are arranging for the provision.of more accommodation at certain of these colonies.  There are at present only occasional  vacancies at theseinstitutions, but the Managers  have promised to receiveurgent cases on  specific representation as to each casefrom the  Ministry.  Where a severe case of epilepsy  forwhich colony treatment  is desired  comes before a LocalCommittee, they  may  communicate with the  Ministrystating   full   particulars,   and   an   endeavour willthen  be  made to arrange for the  man&apos;s admission.  Assoon  as the arrangement is made  the Local  Committeewill be notified,  and all payments to the Institution andallowances (if any) due to  the  man and his family willbe made by the Ministry of  Pensions. ,. ...    ;  Paraplegics and Paralytics. - -   These cases, unless sufficiently recovered to be sent to their-own homes, are on discharge provided with accommoda-tion  in institutions  under  arrangements made  centrallyby the Ministry with the help of the  British  Red Cross Society  and the Order  of St.  John,  which  have both provided  special  hospitals  for this class of case, and secured   accommodation  in a  large  number  of other institutions.  In  such cases the  Ministry will  be. re- sponsible  for.  all payments to the institution and  for allowances to the man and his  family.   When  a case  comes  to  the knowledge of  the Local Committee some time  after  discharge,  the  Committee may communicate with the County Director of the British Red Cross Society (unless they are able otherwise to place the man in a suitable institution), who will assist them to find  a bed for the case.   In  these  cases  the Local Committee will  be responsible for all payments to  the  -/ 11946  :;        -  &apos; &apos;   -                      B 2 .&apos;-
institution and for allowances to the man and his family;.but if any case appears to be likely to be incurable the-Local Committee should, under Instruction 39, request theMinistry to take responsibility for the  continuation ofall payments.  ...;  .         . . -. .    ... &apos;-,  Many of the cases requiring to be sent to institutions areserious and require prolonged treatment.  It is desirablethat these cases should be  provided for in large well -managed establishments, where they  can have the bestnursing and be provided with all comforts possible.  Theonly institutions exclusively provided for these cases arethe Star and Garter, Richmond, Lonsdale  House, RalstonHouse, Glasgow, and the East Lancashire Home;  but itis  hoped that  additional accommodation for  this classmay be arranged for.   ..;;.&apos; \ Loss of Limbs and supply of Artificial Limbs.  Cases of loss of limbs&apos;are, as soon as the men are&quot; readyto be  fitted with artificial  limbs, treated  at. the Special.Limbless  Auxiliary  Hospitals.   Of these  the  largest isQueen Mary&apos;s Auxiliary  Convalescent  Hospital, Roe-haropton House, Roehamptqn, which deals with morethan two-thirds of all the cases.  Others are  Edenhall.Hostel, Kelso ; Princess Louise Scottish Hospital,  ErskineHouse, Bishopston,  near Glasgow  ;  the  Duke of Con-naught^ Auxiliary Hospital, Bray, near Dublin, Ireland ;the Ulster Volunteer Force Hospital, Botanic Gardens,.Belfast ; and The Prince of Wales&apos; Hospital, Cardiff.  Any artificiaT limb necessary  is provided before  the-man\s  discharge1 from service..  If after discharge  theartificial limb requires repair or readjustment the manshould  be directed  to report to the nearest  militaryhospital, when arrangements will at once be made by the-officer in charge to notify the Ministry of Pensions witha view to  the man  being  sent back to Roehampton, orother of the above; hospitals, unless the required repairor adjustment  is  of  a minor&apos; character  which  can  besatisfactorily carried  out locally at  a reasonable  cost,  inwhich  case the matter will&apos;be arranged by the medicalofficer  of the local military hospital.; ,-  In some cases the condition of  the stump may growworse and requite, surgical treatment, and in these cases-
the Local Committee should send the man  to. the nearestmilitary or general hospital for examination and treatment.  When  removal to Roehatnpton  or one  of  the  otherspecial . auxiliary  hospitals for the  purpose  of refitting,the man&apos;s pension and allowance will be arranged bythe Ministry.  The man&apos;s stay in these  hospitals is, as arule, a very  short one, but if in any case  the  period ofstay should.be prolonged, the  Ministry will make theallowances authorised  under Article G  to the  wife ordependants.              V ...              &apos;-;   Orthopedic  Cases. . &quot;&apos;  Cases of  wound  or  injury, other than actual  loss oflimb, are most numerous and may at any time need eithermedical or surgical treatment  or orthopaedic  treatment,that is treatment  by massage,  electricity or mechanicalappliances  or manual training given  in  special  work-shops designed  to  restore the function of a  paralysedmuscle or nerve.   Orthopaedic  treatment  is of specialimportance in the early days after a man&apos;s disch-trge.  Insome of these cases the immediate discomfort  felt  fromthe injury may be small, and if it does not  interfere withhis temporary employment  in  some form or  other theman is tempted  to  neglect  proper treatment  with theresult that he may  ultimately  either lose the use of alimb or member or require a very much  longer and  moretedious treatment later.  Local  Committees should there-fore specially mark these cases for attention.  Many of the military and  some of the civil hospitalshave some facilities  for orthopaedic treatment, but  thereare at present only a limited number of  institutions fullyequipped for this purpose to which the more serious cases*can be sent.   These are the Militarj- Orthopaedic Hospital,Ducane Road, ShephercVs Bush, London, W.; Alder HeyAuxiliary  Hospital,  Knotty Ash,  Liverpool;  WelshMetropolitan War Hospital,  Whitchurch, near  Cardiff;Second Northern General Hospital, Becketts Park, Leeds ;Beaufort  War Hospital, Fishponds,  Bristol;  EdinburghWar Hospital, Bangour;  Old Mill Hospital, Aberdeen;Bellahouston Hospital, Glasgow; Ulster. Volunteer Force  * These cases are distinguished  by Army Council Instruction as&quot; Orthopaedic A,&quot; and will be so denoted in. the Form A.F.W. 3555.
Hospital,  Belfast; Military Orthopaedic Hospital, Black-rock, Dublin; and other orthopaedic hospitals are in courseof promotion.  Treatment of discharged men in these hospitals is innearly all cases out-patient treatment, and necessitates theman being lodged in the neighbourhood of the hospital.In  any case &quot;where the military hospital on  examina-tion of the case recommends special orthopaedic treatment,the  Local Committee  should communicate with  theMinistry of Pensions who will arrange for his treatmentat one  of the  above  centres.  The  Ministry will  beresponsible for all allowances  to the man and his familvand payments to the institution.                      The Blind.  Cases of total blindness on discharge  from Militaryhospitals are sent to St. Dunstan&apos;s Hostel,  Regenfs Park,London, in connexion with  which  there  are branchconvalescent  homes at Brighton and  Torquay, or in thecase of Scottish soldiers to Newington  House,  Edinburgh.The men receive in these institutions a course of trainingextending over some months in a large variety of occupa-tions&apos; and are wherever possible placed in employmenton leaving the institutions.  All charges and allowances for men in these  institutionsand their families are paid by the Ministry.                   Venereal Disease.  The attention of Local Committees is drawn to the factthat under the  Public  Health (Venereal Diseases) Regu-lations, 1916, local clinics  are being set up in all largetowns at  which treatment  for these  diseases can  beobtained free  of charge.  Any man discharged on thisaccount, who  should  happen to  apply  to  the  LocalCommittee,  should be referred to the nearest  clinic,information as  to  which  can be  obtained  from  theMedical Officer  of Health  of  the county  or countyborough.              ;                 &apos;V  Lodging for out-patients receiving treatment away           ........   from home.  Men who are sent for out-patient treatment  (e.g. ortho-paedic treatment) to  a hospital at such a distance that they
are obliged  to live away from home, will have to findlodgings.  A. Local Committee, in whose district there isa special hospital, which is  attended  by men from otherdistricts, would do good service  by drawing up a list ofsuitable lodgings for  the men during their  stay or byconcerting arrangements  for  the purpose  with a  hostel.It is of great importance that the beneficial  results oftreatment should not be prejudiced by the men stayingin unhealthy houses.  A Local  Committee, which is sending a man for out-patient treatment away from his home, should communi-cate with the Local Committee of the area to which theman is going and ask the latter to look after the man and, ifpossible, to arrange a suitable lodging for him.  If theman had refused any lodging so found, and it were foundthat he had selected a lodging which was clearly likely toprejudice his recovery, it would be competent to the LocalCommittee to deal with his case under Instruction 17.                   TRAINING.  Arrangements for training will in nearly all cases be madeby the Local Committee or  Disablement Sub-Committee,except that  in  areas where a Joint  Committee of twoor more Local  Committees has  been  set up, and  hashad delegated to  it the power  of advising, arranging foror actually  providing training,  the Joint Committeeshould be referred to before any work of training exceptin isolated cases is undertaken.                 Men to be trained.  Not every discharged disabled man  will be a propersubject  for  training.   Article 6  of the Royal Warrantwas not intended to provide a course of training  at theexpense of the State  for any man who merely fanciesa  new  occupation  in place of  his  old   one.   UnderInstruction IS the determining consideration is whetherthe man&apos;s disablement makes training desirable  in hisinterest.  Apart  from  the  cases  in  which the  man is:physically quite tmable to  resume  his old occupation,there will  be men in skilled  trades before  the  warwhose  disablement makes it doubtful if they can  relyon  obtaining  the wage  they  would  otherwise   have
 earned  or  for whom it  would  involve risk to their health to resume their former occupations.  Again, there Avill be discharged disabled men, especially younger men, who were in an unskilled occupation before the war but who are of an age and natural aptitude for training to a superior occupation to that in which they were previously engaged, and  whose training will  be a real advantage to the community.   For these men  their disablement  may render their previous occupations precarious  as  a  per- manent  source of  livelihood,  and it may be in their interest  to acquire a  skilled  occupation which promises greater security.   In  considering  the fitness of a man for training  the Local  Committee will  look to the considerations laid down in Instruction 25, and of these the most  important is that of securing a permanent livelihood for the man.        &apos; &apos;  :  &apos;&apos;   Trades to he taught.   The Local Committee or the Joint  Committee,  as  the case may be, should, at the outset, make enquiry of asso- ciations of employers and workpeople in their  area with regard  to  the capacity of the  various trades  to  absorb trained  men   before  they embark on  any scheme of training.   Training falls into two main divisions     (a) training of men in factories or workshops ;    (b) courses of training, in technical institutes or in         similar institutions.    Training for Men in Workshops or Factories.   (a) Where it is desired to train an individual man or small group of men in a particular workshop or factory, e.g., in boot repairing or  tailoring, etc., Instruction 15  (2) allows the  Local Committee  to   make  the   necessary arrangements  for a  small  number of men up to .5 in any single industry without applying for the approval of the Minister of Pensions, provided that the training conforms, to  the  general  conditions laid  down  in Schedule IV  to  the  Instructions. Training  for any number  in  excess  of  this  must  be  submitted  forapproval to the Ministry of Pensions.  Particular  atten-tion is  drawn to  the requirement of paragraph     of
-A Schedule IV, that the employer must undertake to give definite instruction to the man, and that the Local  Com- mittee  must be  satisfied  that  the  man  is  receiving instruction.   The  provision  of  training at the public expense must not be used merely to enable a temporary shortage of labour on the part of a particular employer owing  to the war or other causes to be got over if the result  is to  be that  the man fails to  acquire any real technical skill which is likely to secure him permanent employment.   The  Local Committee should also as far as possible make it a condition of training in a factory or workshop that  the employer undertakes to give the man employ - ment, if he is found suitable, at the end of the period of training.   Paragraph 7 of Schedule IV has been framed to  meet cases where the work performed by the man is likely to be of some value to his employer during the  course of training.  In such cases it  is clearly advisable that the employer should pay the wage which  properly represents- the value of the man&apos;s work.  This can be usually arranged without difficulty.   Thus, for instance an employer may a^ree with the Local Committee  to pay a man 10s. a week for the  first two months, and 20s. a week for the third and. fourth  months.  In such  a case the  Local Committee would pay the man if he had  no children 17s. Qd. for the first two months and 7s. Gd. a week for the remainder of the period.                     &apos; -:   As a  working rule it should be arranged at the begin- ning of the training what average wages would be paid. for successive periods during the course of training. Training Courses in Technical Institutes or otherwise.  (V)  Courses, of Technical training in Technical Schoolsor Institutes  are. on  a different footing from the train-ing of individual men in workshops or factories.  Here alsoLocal  Committees should endeavour to obtain from localemployers an understanding that they will find employ-ment  for the  men at  the end of their period of training,but it will not  be always possible to secure a definiteguarantee.  Hence it is important that the  Local Com-mittees should  enquire very carefully not only into thepresent demand for  labour in the  particular trade but
 also into the probable demand for labour at the conclu- sion of the  war after the able-bodied men now in the army have returned.  Some  occupations at the present moment.are in temporary demand, e.g., chauffeurs  and motor  mechanics,  but in view of  the  large number of skilled men who will be returning to these occupations after demobilisation, training  in them should be avoided. From  this point of view consultation  with  employers of labour and  with  associations of workpeople in the particular  trade is all-important in forecasting  the future condition  of  any trade and  the  reasonable probability that the men when trained will be  able to  find  employ- ment.                                         *   Proposals for a course or courses of Technical  training in an Institute must under Instruction 22 be submitted as a &quot;scheme&quot;  for  the  approval   to  the   Minister  of Pensions..   This  procedure   is  necessary  in order  to ensure . co - ordination  between  schemes   of  training put forward  by  different Local or Joint  Committees, especially  in  the case of proposals from  a number of Local Committees  in different parts of the country to start training men  for the same trade.  It will be the-business of the Ministry, in  such  cases, to ascertain the views of the Trade as a  whole. :  For this purpose Trade Advisory  Committees have been and are being set up by the  Ministry of Labour acting in  conjunction with the Ministry of Pensions, in each  of  the  principal trades likely  to  be affected by Training Schemes,  Each Trade Advisory  Committee  consists of an  equal  number of representatives  nominated by the  Associations  of  Em- ployers and Workpeople respectively in the trade  con- cerned. The business of these  Committees is to advise the  Ministry of  Pensions as to  the conditions, under which the training of disabled men in the various trades can best  be given,  the  best  methods  of  training,  the suitable centres for it, and generally to secure uniformity in the training.        \  &apos;\   In order to simplify the procedure as far as  possible there  are. embodied  in  Schedule  III  certain  general conditions which must ordinarily be complied  with in  any scheme  of  training, and the Ministry  will ordinarily be prepared to approve any  scheme of train- ing  put  forward  by  a  Local  Committee  as  long as
it conforms to  the general conditions laid down  inthose Schedules.   As  far: as  fees  are  concerned theMinistry is prepared to  pay  only the &quot; out of pocket &quot;expenses over and  above the ordinary standing expensesof the Technical Institute that can be shown to be due tospecial arrangements  needed  for the training of disabledmen, i.e., additional  teachers,  raw  material,  &amp;c.  It  isreckoned that a fee  of 7s. 6d. per head per week will, as arule,  be the maximum that is needed to cover this cost,and in any application for permission to exceed this sumthe Local  Committee must be able to prove that thereare exceptional  circumstances.  The manner  in  whichthe &quot; out of pocket  expenses &quot; are arrived at must in allcases be  stated&quot; in the application from the Local Com-mittee. -  Special attention is drawn to the  need of  consultinglocal  associations of Employers and  Workpeople  in thetrade concerned.  (See Paragraph 6 of Schedule III. and7 of  Schedule IV.)   It&apos; is important in any scheme  oftraining that the opinion of  the trade, should be ascer-tained, and such consultation  before the submission of. ascheme will materially facilitate its ultimate approval. :  On schemes of technical  training  in  Institutes it  isvery desirable that the Joint Committee (if one has beenconstituted) should be consulted.  The Joint Committee,which has knowledge of the training&apos; schemes already  inoperation over a wider area than that of the single LocalCommittee, will be  able to give useful advice, and it willthus be possible on the  one  hand to avoid unnecessaryduplication of schemes and on the other hand to makethem serve as large  an area as possible.  It must be remembered that there are certain processeswhich are  taught in technical  schools because they arespecially  suitable for apprentices or other young persons.Care should be taken not to  include these processes in ascheme of training for disabled men merely because theyhappen to be included in. the curriculum of the technicalschool.  It  will in  some cases be found that the periodrequired for learning them is too long for an adult tounder-take, in other cases that the special dexterity necessary canonly he acquired in youth, or in others that the skill neededimplies an exceptionally high standard of intelligence, oragain that the openings in such trades are extremely limited
                                                    A.in number.  This caution applies especially to such tradesamong others as plumbing, telegraphy,  saddlery, compo-siting, and woodcarving.                  &quot;Special&quot; Trades.   Instruction 23 laj s down that the Minister of  Pensionsmay, after  consultation with  the Ministry of Labour,declare any trade to  be a special trade.   The declarationof a trade as a &quot;special trade&quot; will mean  that trainingfor that trade will have to be given in accordance with  Xthe  conditions determined by the Minister of  Pensions  Iafter consultation with the Trade Advisory Committee.  \These conditions will be issued to Local Committees and  \will govern not only any future proposals  submitted  by  gthe Committee but any training already in operation unless  Iin any case the Local Committee can show special reason  jto the contrary.  The advice of the Trade Advisory Committee will be  Iasked upon the period of training  necessary, the questionof a special improver&apos;s wage if any, after the period oftraining is over, and the number of men that can safely betrained, taking the trade as a whole into consideration.  Insome cases the conditions attaching to a certified trade willcontain provisions somewhat on the lines of the regula-tions governing apprentices  or learners,  though  such  1conditions may be considerably modified in view of the  1fact that it is adult men and not youths who are concerned.  [1\&apos; &apos;-.          . Wages after Training.  General  questions affecting the rates of wages in  a  1given  trade will come within the province of the  Trade  1Advisory Committee,  but  they  cannot deal  with  a  ljquestion as to the rate of wage that should be paid to any  Iman so&apos; disabled as not to be  able to produce, even after  Itraining,  as much as an able-bodied man can  produce.  1For this purpose Advisory Wage Boards have been and  Iare being  set up by the Ministry of Labour in all the  jprincipal towns, and to these  Boards  such matters can be  jreferred by Local Committees or by the individual men or  Iemployers affected.               .  Length of Training.  Paragraph 8 of Schedule III. lays down that the period ifof training in a Technical Institute shall not,  without Jj
the  sanction of the  Ministry  of Pensions, exceed  sixmonths.   If a longer period is  desired in any case  theLocal Committee must  show that the conditions of  thetrade require it.   It is recognised that certain trades mayrequire a longer period of training, and in some of  the*&apos; special&quot; trades a longer period may be laid down as oneof the conditions under which training may be given.  Paragraph 8 of Schedule 4 similarly restricts the periodof training in a  factory  or  workshop  to  four months.Experience has shown that  a shorter  period  of actualtraining  is often advisable where the man is to continueworking under the same employer after-training.  Here,however, also it is recognised that there are certain tradeswhich may require a  longer  period, but  for  this  thesanction  of the Ministry must be obtained.  In all cases the training given should be  of. sufficientlength to ensure that the disabled man will  acquire such-degree of skill that he will have a reasonable prospectof permanent employment.  Only in exceptional  casesshould trainiog.be given  for a shorter  period  than twomonths.  The training should as a rule be given in the  day  time,.and  for  a week of 30 hours at least.  In most cases itwill  be found  that a course of from 35  to 40 hours willbe advisable.  Training Outside the Area of the  Local  Committee.  It is important that disabled men should not be sentfor training away from their own homes unless this, isclearly justified.  Paragraph 9 of Schedule III. requiresthat  a married man shall not be sent for training  awayfrom his wife and home  without the  sanction of  theMinister of Pensions, and  in  applying for such sanction-a Local Committee will be asked to furnish the informationindicated in that paragraph.  In many cases the man willnaturally find employment in the occupation for whichhe has received training in the district where the trainingwas  given.  A single  man in  such cases  will  find  nodifficulty in migrating, and in the case of  the marriedmen the  Local Committee  of the Ministry should be  satis-fied  before he undertakes the training that he is preparedto go where employment can be  given him  in the  tradefor which he is being trained.
 Lodging for men receiving training aivay from home.  It is equally important in the case of training as in thecase of  treatment to secure  suitable lodgings for menobliged to live away from home, and the remarks on page-38 are applicable.   &quot;.&apos;  &apos;  A list of tlie more important courses of training whichhave been approved and of the Institutions in which theyare being given will be issued from time to time to LocalCommittees by the Ministry of Pensions, and  in specialcases  a Local Committee  will be empowered  to  sendmen for training to one of these Institutions althoughoutside  their own area, subject, however, to the following.conditions :       ...    (ft) The Committee should in all cases act in agree-        ment with  the  Local Committee of the area to        which  the  man is to be sent,  since  the latter        Committee   will  have   been  responsible  for        providing the course  of training.    (&amp;)&apos; A man should not be sent to a course of  training        outside the  area of any  Joint Committee  that        may have  been constituted  without  first  con-        suiting the  Joint Committee, who will, in the    &apos;.&apos;  nature of the case, have wider knowledge of the        facilities for instruction within or near its area ;    (c) In no case should a  man be sent for training in a.        factory or workshop outside the area of the Joint        Committee.
PAYMENT   OF   CHARGES   AND   ALLOW-    ANCES    DURING   TREATMENT   AND    TRAINING.   .,-  The question whether  treatment or  training can  begiven to any discharged man and whether allowances arepayable depends in the first instance  on whether  theman&apos;s disablement is determined by  the Minister to be&quot; attributable &quot;  to his &quot;War Service or not.  (See Instruc-tion 30.)  If the case is not attributable to War Service theLocal Committee are empowered in these Instructions toprovide treatment in or at an institution only, not training,and allowances are not payable (see page 23).  In any case of doubt as  to the eligibility of a man fortreatment or training and allowances, the Local Committeeshould enquire  of the Ministry of Pensions, before under-taking the  case, but the following general rules will besufficient guide  to the Committee in the majority of caseswhere they cannot ascertain the facts from the man : :    (a) A  discharged man who has  received or is  re-        ceiving a gratuity may be assumed not to be an    *.-    &quot;attributable&quot; case, unless oh application to the        Ministry the  Committee  are informed to  the        contrary. \ The only cases of a gratuity, and these   :..--&apos;&apos;&apos;-&apos;. will be fev, which are &quot; attributable&quot; cases  are        those  awarded under  Art.&apos; 7 (1) of the Royal        Warrant.  (See -Appendix A.)    (b) A man  in receipt of a pension  of less than 5s. 6d.        a  week may always  be  assumed not to be an      - &quot; attributable &quot; case.   &apos;   ; (c) A married man with  children in receipt of any        pension of larger amount than 5s. 6d. but not in        receipt  of children&apos;s allowances may be  assumed      v not to be an  attributable &quot; case.  There will be        a  few  cases  of men  who if  they  had  been        Privates  would have  been awarded a  Service        pension under the old Warrants of 4s. Sd., but        being  of higher  rank they receive&apos; a  larger        pension.    Payment of Allowances in  Attributable&quot; Cases.  The general.  rule will be that where the Local Com-mittee make arrangements for the man&apos;s treatment  or
training  and so  become responsible  for the  charge  inrespect  of  such  treatment or  training,  they will  beresponsible also for the allowances to the man and his-family ; and where on the other  hand such arrangementsare made by  the Ministry, the Ministry will pay allcharges and allowances.  There  will,  however, be someexceptions to this general rule to  be noted below.  In practice,  the Local  Committee will be responsible-for making arrangements and for paying all allowances incases  of  (raining, except for  blind  men  sent  to St.Dunstan&apos;s Hostel, or Newington House, Edinburgh, andunless  in any particular case  arrangements for  specialtraining are made by the Ministry.  In the following cases of treatment arrangements foradmission will frequently be  made  by  the  Ministry,and, where this is done, the Ministry will pay all chargesand allowances and the Local Committee should make no-payments, e.g.  :-    (a)  Men in Asylums for the Insane or  boarded-out        with relatives by the  Lunacy Authorities or dis-        charged on trial from Asylums. For these cases-        a Local  Committee should make no  payments.        Where a man  is removed to the  Observation        Ward  of a  Workhouse temporarily, pending        admission to  an Asylum, the Local Committee       . should recover  the  Identity Certificate and f or-        ward  it  to the Pension Issue Office, who will        thereupon pay  the&apos;allowance of 13s.  9c/. to the       . man&apos;s wife (if any) and  children&apos;s allowances, or        if the man is unmarried, the allowance authorised     ,   by Instruction 34 to a dependant, and the Com-        mittee should make no payments.  Any claim        from  the Guardians or Parish Council should  be        referred  to the Pension Issue Office, Baker-street. -       W. 1.        ,       -  &apos;.     ...  -    (b) Men receiving  treatment  in a Sanatorium  or       , Hos2)ital on account of Tuberculosis.   Under the        special  arrangements  (referred to on  page 30)        which are in  process of being made, the Ministry         will be notified on the man&apos;s admission to the     .    Institution and will assume responsibility for all         payments.and allowances.   This system will not.         however, be  in  full working order for  a little
        time, and meanwhile in any ease which comes tc        the knowledge of the Local  Committee, where      -  such notification  has not apparently been  re-   .     ceived and allowances are not being paid,  the        Local Committee  should recover the ring-paper        and pay the necessary allowance.    (c) Men sent by the Ministry direct to special insti-        tutions  for  treatment  in cases  of paraplegia      &apos;  (paralysis), epilepsy,  or neurasthenia.   Cases        arranged for by Local Committees will  be paid&apos;        for by them.    (d)  Men sent to limb-fitting hospitals.   A very large        number of such cases require less than a weekV        treatment, and only in  exceptional cases does        the treatment last  longer than a fortnight  or        three  weeks.  In these cases, therefore,  the        Ministry will arrange for payment of all charges        and allowances  on  notification from  the hos-        pital.    (e)  Men sent  by the  Ministry direct  to orthopaedic        centres  or to military  or  other hospitals  for        treatment where such treatment has been  ad-        vised by a Medical Board on re-survey, that is,.        where  the man  is medically  examined by  a   -     Board prior to renewal of a conditional pension.  Payment by the Ministry of all charges and allowances,.Avhere in the above cases the Ministry make the arrange-ments, is administratively  more convenient, and when, asin most  of  the cases, the treatment is prolonged,  centralpayment.will be for the convenience of Local Committees..In cases likely  to  be  of  long duration the  Local Com--mittee should always notify the Pension Issue Office, and.request  that office to  assume responsibility  for  all pay-men ts and allowances.  In all cases  of  payment  by the Ministry the  LocalCommittee will be notified.      Procedure for. payment of Allowances by ; - . . ;y.:&apos;        . Local Committees.  There are two kinds of allowances permitted to be paidby a local committee under Article 6- of the Royal Warrantand these Instructions, namely :  .v.  .  (a)  Where the man, whilst still living at home and        able to  work  at  his ordinary occupation, has to.
o        attend as an  oxit-patient at a  hospital  under       -arrangements made by the Local Committee, his      v  pension  continues, but : he  may be  given  an     :   allowance for loss of time and travelling expenses ;       under Instruction 10. ;              -  :. (6)  Where the man cannot, owing to his treatment or       &apos; training, or to. the physical  condition  which       &quot; necessitates  either, work at his ordinary occupa-        tion,  or  at any other  remunerative occupation        which would  provide  him a livelihood, he may        be given an allowance  instead of his pension        under Instructions 33 to 37.  Before any  allowance  can be paid it must be remem-bered that           ...    (1.) The s Local  Committee  must  in every case of     -----  treatment obtain a medical certificate or statement        giving in substance the information required by        Instruction  10, to be kept by them in  the  first  -    .  instance, as authority for any allowance paid, and        to be forwarded on completion of the treatment        to the Pension Issue Office.  .  (2.) If the case (whether one of treatment or training)        is of the kind  covered by  (b) above, the Local        Committee must recover.the &quot;ring paper&quot;, or        Identity Certificate and forward it to the Pension      -  Issue Office before beginning to pay any allow-     .   ft wee.  The Local  Committee are not authorised        to give the man a . supplement so as to bring his       - &quot;pension up to the maximum rate as has hitherto        been  the practice under the Regulations  of the        Statutory , Committee.   . The.  Committee must     :-..  - notify the allowances proposed to be paid  on the        prescribed form.                 - .  -  (3) If  the man is sent to live in an institution, 7s. a        week  must  be  deducted from the  allowance      ..&apos;  credited to him as a contribution towards the cost    .     of his maintenance. This will not apply where        the man goes to a hostel during a course of train-  -  -    ing because in this case he is merely regarded as        in temporary lodgings.    (4) If he  is sent to live in an instituti on he is entitled        to be paid as personal  allowance 5s. a  week or        such  lesser or larger amount as the Minister may
in particular case or class of institution determine(Instruction 34A).  Experience  has shown thatin certain classes of institution the necessary dis-cipline  and order cannot be maintained if the-inmates  are  allowed more than a very smallamount of pocket money.. The Local Committeemust enquire of the  man  whether he wants 5s..weekly or a less amount (if any) paid him ; butthey cannot exceed this amount without sanction..The balance of the amount&apos;(which, e.g., in the caseof  a  private would be 15s. 6d) should, if  he-wishes, be paid to his wife or it may be accumu-lated and paid him on his  completion of the full.course of treatment  or training alloived.  If he-gives up the treatment and leaves the institutioncontrary to medical  advice he forfeits his rightto the balance under Instruction 37 (V).   If sucha case occurs it should  be at once reported to theMinistry for decision.At the end of the treatment or training the insti-tution should be paid the charges agreed  on andthe 7s. deducted from the man&apos;s  allowance will-go towards this payment.  .&quot;.

Circular No. 8.                              /     MINISTRY  OF  PENSIONS,                                               SECRETARY&apos;S OFFICE,                                                      WESTMINSTER HOUSE,                                                           MILLBANK,-&apos; -Tv-:;v ;vV ;:;-V;:: &apos;     V&apos;.             ^ :v.-:;;;    LONDON, .S.W.1. -0          VV-V^&apos;-^13*A       1917.    :  :j    SIR           I -am directed by the  Minister  of Pensions  to  forward copies of theInstructions for the  administration of  Article 6 of the Royal  Warrant and Order inCouncil of March, 1917, which provides for the treatment and training of dischargeddisabled men who are entitled to, or are in receipt of, a disability pension.    It is the intention of the Minister  to  ask Local  Committees to undertake a largemeasure of responsibility for both treatment  and training, and the  Instructions havebeen  so framed that, within the lines laid  down by them, Local Committees  are left asubstantial discretion as to the  arrangements to  be made.   At.the same time theproblem of dealing with the disabled  men has assumed  such proportions  that it  isessential that the handling of it should be  systematised and the Instructions  have beendesigned to provide Committees with expert guidance in their dealing with cases.        .        -/&apos;:::            TREATMENT.    Medical attendance and treatment by a general practitioner in the man&apos;s  home willnow be secured under arrangements made by the Insurance Commissioners for practicallyall discharged soldiers, uninsured as well as insured, in all parts of the Kingdom exceptIreland, and it is hoped that arrangements may shortly be made there also.  Article 6 ofthe Royal Warrant and these Instructions  are designed to provide the special treatmentwhich maybe necessary in consequence of the man&apos;s  disablement.  This  treatmentshould, save in exceptional cases, be given  in Military or Civil hospitals, and  with theseLocal Committees should,  if the)&apos; have not already done so,  make  the  necessaryarrangements  and submit their proposals to the Ministry.   But in order to  determiuewhether special treatment is necessary, and  if so the particular institution which maybe suitable for  a  case, the Local  Committee should have competent medical advice. So far as regards men who are about to be or have just  been discharged from Service this will be furnished by the Military  hospitals  in the  Army  Form W.3555, but for cases arising  sometime after discharge  the Instructions require that  ordinarily the necessary advice will be  given by. a. Medical Referee who will be  appointed by the Minister of Pensions.      The Minister proposes to ask Local Committees to  assist in obtaining the services of suitable medical practitioners as  Medical  Referees, and will shortly communicate-further with your  Committee in  the matter.   Meantime, pending the  appointment of Medical Referees,  the  Local Committee  should continue to obtain .medical advice  on their cases as they have hitherto done.      On  the  arrangements  to be made for  medical treatment the  general directions given on pages 25 to 39 of the Notes should be carefullv studied.                                   TRAINING.      Training for civil employment where  the man&apos;s disablement renders training for a fresh employment desirable, is a matter  demanding as  careful judgment as medical treatment.   Where  a disabled man  is obliged to change  his former  occupation, the Local  Committee will have to  consider  his aptitude  for the new occupation, the thoroughness .of the training that is  proposed or  is available,  and, above  all,  the probability of the  man finding  in the  employment, after he has been  trained,  a permanent source of livelihood.   The  Instructions  which  have  been prepared are  all designed to secure these objects, and the requirement that proposals for training, apart    (H280)  17326/G33.  3,000  7/17.  M.&amp;S
frcm the cases referred to; in  Instruction 21,  shall be  submitted  to  the  Minister forapproval, is directed solely to assist Local Committees  to give such training as is inthe disabled man&apos;s best interest.           *&apos;.:* ...         &apos;                     &apos;.  &apos;*rS?        ;vy;&apos;;t^;,v;; joint;&apos; IcoMittees/^:  : ;;&apos;zyi7:-:^--i-Z       The Minister desires to emphasize the importance of co-operation with the Joint (Disablement)  Committee where such, a Committee has been constituted for an area comprising several  Local Committees.   If the arrangements  for either  treatment or training are to. be  effective it is necessary that the existing resources of the country in the  wav&apos;of special hospitals  (such  as  Orthopaedic hospitals), or of. institutions for technical training, should be made available for wide areas.  Among the primary duties of a Joint Committee is  that of ascertaining and classifying the facilities available over a larger area than  that  of the single  Local \ Committee, of concerting  arrangements for -their use, and  a representative of. the Ministry is&quot; appointed in  the  area:of,each.&apos;-&apos;. Joint Committee to assist in this work.       Where,  as in some areas Local  Committt-es have delegated all their powers for dealing with the treatment and training of disabled men to the Joint Committee, the accompanying  Instructions will apply to the Joint Committee.    V    ALLOWANCES  DURING TREATMENT AND TRAINING.       I am to draw your  special attention  to the terms&apos;of Instruction 34 and to the Notes on  pages 4-7 to 51.   Article .6 of the Royal Warrant provides for the payment, in lieu  of pensions,  of  allowances during  a  course of treatment or training  in consequence of which the man &quot;is deemed unable to provide for his  own support and that of his family.&quot;   It was intended by this provision  to avoid  apparent interference with the  man&apos;s rate  of pension, and  to enable  the Local  Committee  to  assume&apos; entire responsibility for  him during his period of treatment  and  training. ,  This involves a slightly different  procedure from  that  in force under  the  Statutory Cqmmittee&apos;s regulations, which allowed of the man&apos;s pension being supplementedduring this period;&apos; It will  now be necessary  before allowances  are paid  in such cases., to recover from the man his identity Certificate  (Ring Paper), and  to forward it with a notification of the case on the prescribed form to Pension Issue Office, Baker Street, W.l.   The procedure is set out fully in Instructions  34 and.in the Notes on pages 49 to 51, and should be carefully studied.  . .      REGULATION 12  OF  THE  STATUTORY COMMITTEESf\&apos;y-;; ^REGULATIONS-^     -  The instructions  now issued will come: into operation on  the 23rd inst.  Fresh cases &quot;will--as  from that  date  be dealt  with  under these Instructions; but: cases still current at  that date may Continue to be dealt with under  the present Regulations of the Statutory Committee for the remainder of their periods of treatment or training. It has been arranged with the Statutory.Committee that all communications  respecting treatment  and  training shall as from the 9th July  be sent to the Ministry of Pensions at the above  address, except so far as for particular purposes the Instructions require com- munications to be addressed to other Branches (such as the  Pension Issue Office) of the Ministry.            , :&quot;::v:       .r:- -! --*     &apos;-4; V-        The necessary  supply of forms for use in connection  with these Instructions will be forwarded to Local Committees in; the course of a few days.     &apos;. -  - - &apos; :.-  v         I am,  Sir, &apos;                &quot;.-    .        -*:::/.&apos;.&quot;    &apos;                  .

WAR PENSIONS, &amp;c,STATUTORY 0OMMITTEE.REPORT TO THE iMSXOIilS MINISTER.    .- : For week&apos; endeA 11th Julyx 1917 *        0RGAII3ATI0N BRMCH.Extracts from Reports of Inspeotors !of Accounts *  STOCKPORT local committee.           This Committee may be  classified  as  good.    I &apos;  examined the Local Pay Sheets which are convenient and well  kepi.   The Accounts are in order, the paying-out which I  witnessed is conducted in an orderlyand systematic manner.  and the work of the Office is carried on in a  businesslike  way.           The Recoverable Advances are coming  in well,  the  amount outstanding is small; and recoveries from the various  Regimental Paymasters are well maintained.  BUTESHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.           Our&quot; Inspector says that this, is a small Committee,  and seems sufficiently well organised and administered for  the work which it has to do.  SOtlTBPORT LOCAL COMMITTEE.  Q           During the last few months every discharged man  notified to the Committee has been sent a letter from the  Local Committee and replies;have been received from about  three fourths of the total  number.   These replies indicate  that in most cases employment; has been found.   The Qther oases  have all received attention from the Local Committee&apos;wherever  possible and this side of the work is very satisfactory. .-           Generally speaking the work of:the Committee is  satisfactory and investigation is usually thorough.  I believe  that a scheme will shortly  be carried out for special visit-  r  ing. of all&apos; cases - there are over 2,000   and then all the  allowances will be reviewed.   Rent Allowances anfbunt to a high figure but Southport is a town of high rents: and often-:  good incomes.                     &apos;&apos;  STALYBRILGE ;L0CAL COMMITTEE *           I find that the working of this Committee may bo  described a^ good.   The Regulations are observed and the &quot;  Recoverable-Advances are of small amount and are being duly  repaid..  &apos; -v:.        -  .              . -   &quot;
          The arrangements for training disabled men.arelimited at present &quot;but every possible assistance.is given bylocal employers of labour.  -Amalgamation with other CheshireCommittees is to take place for the solution of this problem.                     DISAKMENTS BRANCH.Report of the draining Section.          The Section have given provisional sanction  to  thescheme put.forward by Hr. Oppenheimer for the training of.disabled men in Diamond Cutting.. .  The proposal is approved as anexperiment for a maximum number of-.50^men..for. two months, duringwhich the Statutory Committee will pay maintenance grants butno fees in respect of the men so trained, at. the&quot; expiration ofthe two months the Statutory Committee will only pay maintenancegrants in respect of such of the men as Mr. Oppenheimer willgive a written guarantee to engage at the end. of their training,either permanently or for a minimum period of three years, subjectalwavs to their being of satisfactory behaviour.   I r. Oppenheimerhas accepted these conditions and has therefore been authorisedto proceed with the scheme.          It has been decided that a proposal of the DublinI0.cal Committee to arrange for the training  in England of menwho intend to return to Ireland should not be sanctioned butthat arrangements &quot;for the training of a man who intends toremain permanently in England should be made by the LocalCommittee in whose area he settles.          The local Committee for Portsmouth have been inftrmedthat as a course in Munitions work has already beSn approved,the Statutory Committee are unable to sanction any furthercourse in Engineering unless the consent of the local branch ofthe Amalgamated Society of Engineers is. first obtained.  It hasbeen decided not to^sanction the proposal to increase the feeof  2, 2.  0.  already approved by the Statutory Committee inrespect of the course in Motor Driving.          The&quot; Norfolk local Committee have been informed thatthe Statutory Committee are unable to make any capital grantfor the establishment of an institution for the  provision oftraining in agriculture but would be prepared to undertake themaintenance  of men undergoing training at such an institutionprovided the  local Committee could obtain the  necessary capitalfrom other sources.          A scheme for training men in Internal  CombustionEngine Work  submitted by the  Norwich Local Committee  has  beenapproved for  a maximum period of six months,  the proposed&quot;course in commercial work has been approved uncondltienaliyand the training in Artistic Grafts  has  been sanctioned withthe proviso  that only specially selected men are to be  admittedto the classes.   Sanction to the  scheme for training men inPainting and Decorating has been postponed pending  the  receiptof a report  thereon from the  Master  Builders&apos; Asscciatign andthe United Building Trades Committee.
