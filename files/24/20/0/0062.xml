Fountaine of Cowbridge Farm, Toddington,for failure to comply with an Order made some months  ago underRegulation 2k  to  cultivate a 17  acre field for this year&apos;s Harvest.The Bench convicted and imposed  a fine of  10, and intimated thathad not the Committee asked them to take a lenient view as this wasthe first prosecution in the county, they would have  imposed a farheavier penalty.          The  Committee have made 70 Orders for the breaking up ofgrass land upon areas varying from 160 acres to 4  acres indifferent parts of the county, but they are prepared  to withdrawany Order to which a well-founded objection is made.Essex - The Committee have been  authorised to take possession of150 acres of land forming the cultivable part of Foxpurrows Farmwhich belongs  to  the London County Council and adjoins  HainaultForest.  The County Council raised no objection. At the end of theirperiod of possession, the Committee will reinstate the  land so asto make it available again for the purposes of public recreation.Hampshire - The New Milton Golf  Club have been asked to let or culti-vate 100 acres of their course which are, in the opinion of theCommittee, fit for cultivation.  The owner of the Highcliffe GolfCourse has agreed to feed dairy  cows on the course instead of sheep.
Lancashire.   The Committee have been authorised to take possessionof a disused golf course at Lytham, extending to 95 acres, which isowned &quot;by the Urban District Council and is subject to grazingrights up to February 1918.

i3JPPWIII!l.illll iTirr-TT--; ------------------ :----:-;  .     the West Riding  of York,  and  action under  the Pheasants Order is     reported from Derbyshire.                          Bulb Growing,               In  the County of Holland  the  Committee  recently suggested     to  the principal bulb growers an arrangement by t-hich the area     devoted  to bulb  growing should be reduced  by 50%,  25% being     devoted  to food  crops\  and on another 25$  a corn  crop being drilled     between  the rows of bulbs.    This suggested arrangement was     approved,  and copies  of the letter  to the  Holland Committee in     which the  approval wa3  conveyed  have been  sent to the Committees of     23  other counties in  which there is a substantial area devoted to     bulb growing.                  Cultivation  of Lands Order, 1917(No,2),               Reports received from  1,010 Boroughs or  Urban Districts     show that  187,245 applications for  plots have been made, and     169,165  plots containing  a total area of 12,564 acres have been     provided under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No,2).                :: HORTICULTURAL   SECTION,               Attention has been  devoted during the past  fortnight to     the encouragement of  the  sowing  of  suitable varieties of vegetables     on  garden  ground from which early crops have been removed.     Pamphlets  giving instructions for late  summer sowing  have been     Issued to  the 600 Horticultural  Representatives,  and  also to 1,000     Allotment  and Food Production Societies,;     Fruit Bottling,   The  number of jars for wMch orders  have been     received during  the week  is 239,132, bringing the  total number of     orders up  to  1,253,676,    The number of jars despatched during     the week   82,164, making a  total  of 215,952.   The  manufacturersi(    are experiencing considerable difficulty; in turning out the  jars.     The assurance received  from the  Ministry of Munitions that     150,000  would be despatched during  the  week has not been fulfilled,
 and moreover in some districts the railways have refused  to  accept consignments.--   Representations have, however,been made to the railway companies, and there is hope that this cause of delay may be reduced.   Tho Department is also in. daily communication  with the Ministry of Munitions, and has again received an assurance  that the rate of despatch will be largely augmented.   Numerous and serious complaints are being received from societies which have; ordered jars owing to the inability of the Department to deliver them in timei&quot;&apos;          The final class for the training of Travelling Instructors in fruit bottling was.concluded during the week.   Instruction  has now been provided for 80 women, of which number 56 have become Travelling Instructors and the remainder are giving their services in the neighbourhood of their homes.   The total number of demonstrations  which&apos; have been given by the Travelling Instructors is 467.   - Potato Spraying.  :.  The number of machines despatched during  theweek is 1,224,  making a total of 6,000.   The total number of cases of chemicals for. which orders have been received is now 33,428. The number of cases of chemicals despatched during the week  is  . 2,980,: making a total of 32,980Vegetable and Fruit Preserving.   The sanction of the Treasury hasnow been received for the erection of 75 drying stations and 75pulping stations.    The drying stations  will be capable of treating 6-7,000; tons of fresh vegetables each week,  arid the pulping stationswill be capable of dealing with a similar quantity of fruit,  but the. extent to which pulping will be possible this season will be governed chiefly by the number of casks  that can be obtained/The number available is very limited,  and purchases are being madewherever stocks are known to exist.          For the manufacture of drying  plant arid for the material required for the establishment of drying stations in hop oasts in Kent,  the Department have so far only secured priority numbers 4 and 5, and even this is limited to 20 drying machines.    The
  Priority Committee have,however,stated  that  in the  event  of difficulty*  being  experienced in respect of any special  material,  an  application  for  any higher priority will be favourably considered.           The Department have arranged  forone pulping station of 4  units  to be installed at Maidstone,and  Messrs  Cadbury  in  co-operation  with the Department are erecting  two drying  and two pulping units at  Bournville and Badsey.  In addition, negotiations are  proceeding with  respect to the erection of 13 drying units and 9 pulping  units in 8  vegetable and fruit growing districts.  &apos;           An order for300 homescanners has  been placed.   Sufficient  tin-plate for the manufacture of  500,000 cans  has been secured and the  order  for the manufacture of this number has also been given.        ..  Provision is being made for the manufacture  on  a consider-  able scale of jelly from cider apples.  ...           To meet the large and growing demand for  information on  methods of drying suitable for home use, demonstrations in drying are  being  given daily in the Economy Exhibition.   The demonstrations in  fruit  bottling at this Exhibition continue to  be well  attended,,                     : ;: technical division  &quot;Seeds&quot; Mixtures-  Several farms in the western counties  have  been  visited for the collection of data relative  to the  permanence  of  certain species of grasses in known &quot;Seeds&quot;  mixtures.  Areas suitable  for  the harvesting of indigenous seeds  of pasture-forming grasses  for  the rapid formation of good leys have been noted,and information as  to  the  cost of collecting and cleaning the seed of Wild Vtfhite  Clover  and  Cocksfoot is being obtained.  Inspection of Land. (1) A Dorset estate has  been visited,  and advice  given with regard to the bringing into  cultivation  of  selected fields,  and  the improvement of existing pastures.  (2)  A tract of about  1,600  acres  of sandy land in Merionethshire has been inspected  for the pur-  pose of advising the Agricultural Executive  Committee as  to its  culti-  vation and treatment for the production of corn and potatoes in  1918.  A meeting of the owners and occupiers was attended,  and the method of  procedure discussed with them.
Breaking up Grassland.   Over 150 replies have been received to theenquiry on the results  of breaking up grassland in 1916-17.  Thereplies are now being summarised, and it is proposed to issue a leaf-let on the subject.  A large number of pastures in different partsof the country have recently been examined by one of the Department !sbotanical officers, and a memorandum prepared on &quot;Conditions influen-cing the choice of Grass Fields for the Plough,&quot;Supply of Root Seeds.  In view of the possibility of a shortage ofseed in 1919 ^ a leaflet advocating the growing of root seeds hasbeen prepared for distribution to farmers.Plant Diseases.  During the week a large number of cases of pestattacks have been dealt with.   So many outbreaks of wheat bulb flyhave recently been notified that it is proposed to issue an officialannouncement on the danger of sowing wheat after potatoes.                           LABOURMen and Horses for the 1910 Programme. Information has been seht tothe War Office as to the depots to which it is desired that theadditional soldiers, both skilled and unskilled, to be made availablefor the 1918 Programme, should be sent.   The.War. Office have alsobeen informed of the allocation of the first 4,000 skilled and5,000 unskilled men to be furnished.     Treasury sanction for the purchase of 30,000 horses by the    ,Department has now been received.  The Military Authorities havebeen asked to assist by lending heavy draught horses and a number ofsuch horses are being assembled at certain remount depots, convenientfor the counties where  they are to commence work.Harvest Labour.  The national Service Department states that 9,286soldiers made available for harvest work are now working on farms.The Admiralty have agreed that men of the Marine Divisions may assistwith harvest work in the neighbourhood of their stations.      The War Office has granted a concession to members of VolunteerTraining Corps who are  wholly engaged on agricultural work.  Suchmen will be required to attend only one-half the usual number ofdrills in July, August, and September.
Prisoners of War I  Three new schemes for the employment of prisonersof war have been sent to the War Office during the week.  All.Agricultural Executive Committees have been given particulars ofthe prisoner working camps in their county and instrueted to getinto touch with the Commandant as to the possibility ofaccommodating more prisoners at the camp for employment onagricultural work in the neighbourhood.  There are 52 such campsapart from the 10 agricultural camps.                           WOMEN1S LABOUR. -   .  -     I addressed a meeting held in London on the 11th Julyof the Chairman of the Women&apos;s Agricultural Executive Committeesat which the policy and work of the Pood Production Departmentin respect of women&apos;s labour on the land was explained.  Severalletters have since been received testifying to the help andencouragement which those present obtained from the conference.          Latest returns show that approximately 40,000 women haveenrolled under the National Service Scheme for work on the land. &apos;Less than 14,000 of these have answered summonses to appear beforethe Selection and Allocation Committees.  So far as returns areavailable only 5,530 women have actually been accepted; of thesedetailed particulars are available of 5,401 as follows:-       -]\ 1,363 In Instruction Centres.          3,465 On farm work.;;;            366 Waiting for references to be placed in Training                /   Centres.      .      \ :.y.V   /...             93 Waiting for Employment in Depots.            114 Waiting for Employment in their own homes.          The organisation of part-time workers under Croup-Leadersis proving very satisfactory.  There are now 47 Group-Leaders in thecountry and seven vacancies are reported. Representations haverecently been made to Lord Rothermere which will, it is hoped,result in the delivery of outfits by the Royal Army ClothingDepartment, Pimlico being accelerated. With the exception of 700overalls and rather more than 1,000 breeches all demands for NationalService outfits and boots for part-time workers have been completed.
                      MACHINERY AJD IMPLEMENTS.               The reports received from tractor representatives for &apos;   ,-. the week ending 6th July show that the average acreage ploughed     per tractor during the week was 11.6, although many tractors were     held up during that period owing to the shortage of spare parts.     Arrangements have been&apos; made with several manufacturers to supplement     the supply of spare parts, and a considerable Improvement in the     acreage returns is consequently expected very shortly.               Ofthe 100 horse-drawn sprayers purchased by the     Department applications have so far been received from Executive     Committees for only 40.               The total number of Tractors which have been allocated     to Agricultural Executive Committees is now 735.   In addition,     there are 65 Tractors on offer to Committees.   Up to the present     tame, 652 Tractors have been received from America, and 178  .   purchased and delivered from dealers in this country, making a   :  total of 830 Tractors actually obtained by this Department.                         -SUPPLIES.  &apos;     Sulphate of Ammonia.  The sales of sulphate of ammonia through     the Sulphate of Ammonia Distribution Committee have been very     satisfactory, the orders placed with the Committee from June 1st     to July 10th amounting to 23,000 tons.   Arrangements have also     been made for the sale of 6,000 tons to a large firm of Irish . -  ::merchants, and efforts are being made to secure the delivery of    : substantial quantities to Ireland early in the season, in order     to prevent congestion arising from difficulties of transport later     on.         .                   &apos; . ..&apos; . Basic Slag.  The, quantity of basic slag produced during June .    amounted to just &quot;over 37,000 tons, of which 20,000 tons were     delivered to purchasers.   Enquiries made from makers show that the   &quot;  great bulk of the slag to be produced up to 31st May next has  ;: - already, been sold/, four of the largest firms having - entered Into     contracts for, the disposal of the whole of their output,  while  the
remaining firms have sold from 50$ to 80$.   In the latter casesthe makers are heing asked to reserve the balance of their unsoldstock  in order to enable this Department to arrange for itsdisposal, if necessary, to districts . which have been unable tosecure their requirements    Enquiries are also being made fromthe principal dealers with a view to ascertaining how far theyhave already sold to farmers the quantities they have purchasedfrom makers.Superphosphates,   A final decision has not yet been arrived at s;ithregard to the price at which superphosphate:should be sold to farmersbut in the-meantime, the best method of fixing the price of CompoundManures (which consist very largely of superphosphate) has beendiscussed, and the general lines agreed upon.Lime.      application for 20 civilian prisoners of war to be employedby a lime firm in Derbyshire has been granted.  Two firms in $alesare in a position to employ prisoners,  and their applications willbe submitted to the Prisoners of ,:rar Committee this week.          The Inspectors have now visited 20 firms engaged in thelime trade,  and have reported on the conditions obtaining in thedifferent districts.   Assistance has been rendered in regard tolabour in a  number of important cases,  and there is every prospect,that a * material  increase In the output will result.    &apos;      Efforts are also being made to utilise certain suppliesof lime which are at present regarded merely as waste productsowing to their being unsuitable for immediate application to  theland,.   Kilns are required In several cases to dry the material,and plans of a suitable type of kiln are being prepared.    Thereseems,  at present, to be little evidence of any substantial demand -for lime beyond what can be met from local sources.
(,:.  7M:M WihWM&amp;SMMMWW:   Seed Wheat. Purchasing Committees have been instructed to  cease   buying seed wheat of the 1916 crop.    So far as  is  known at  present,   approximately 5,000 quarters have been bought,            The Selection Committee appointed to  inspect crops of  the   approved varieties of wheat of the 1917 crop, have  begun their work.   The Committee met at Cambridge - on the 17th instant  for a preliminary   joint inspection prior to work being started in  the areas  allotted   to the individual members.    .            A Draft Order prohibiting  the sale, prior to the 1st   November 1917, of winter sown winter beans for  any  purpose other than.   seed has been referred to the Ministry of Food.   This is  necessary   owing to the serious failure of this year &apos; s crop...   Seeds other than Cereals   A letter  has been addressed to  leading   firms, who contract with growers for the production of root  seeds,   asking them to provide particulars of (a)  the average  area under   contract for the period 1910-1913, (b)  the actual area under contract   for the production of root seeds to  be harvested in 1918,  and (c)   the approximate area concerning which negotiations  may still be  pend-   ing,   It is hoped that full information may be  available  by the   21st instant.   Reports from the seed-growing counties indicate  that   growers of rootjfe seeds still consider that the question of increasing   the area under cultivation for the production of these seeds is   dependent on an advance in the terms offered for contract, but,  if   this difficulty is overcome, no  insuperable obstacle should  be found   in securing a supply of root^ seed for sowing in 1919  sufficient to .  meet reasonable needs.   Seed Potatoes.   A conference was held on the 13th  instant to  consider   the steps which should be taken to provide  seed potatoes through  th$   Department in 1918.        A brief summary  of the results   of distribution to small growers in  1917 was submitted and   those present were asked to express  an  opinion
as to whether the scheme;of 1918 should be confined to supplyingpotatoes to small growers or whether, in view of the increased arealikely to be placed under this crop in 1918, it would be desirableto hold a reserve to meet the additional needs of farmers.   Theconference were of opinion that the 1918 scheme should be confinedto supplying the small grower except in so far as the counties ofLancashire, Cheshire and  Shropshire were concerned.   In view ofthe prevalence of wart disease on farms in these counties theconference recommended (a)  that arrangements should be made throughthe Ministry of Food to set aside Scottish crops of certain immunevarieties suitable for farm cultivation, and (b) that seed of thesevarieties should only be sent into England and Wales under licencesto be issued by the Board of Agriculture.   By this means the needsof farmers in infected areas would be adequately provided for.  Theconference also recommended that provision should be made for thepurchase of immune varieties and of selected main crop non-resistantvarieties, for the supply of small growers in 1918.   It Is notproposed, however, to take  steps to carry this recommendation intoeffect as regards non-resistant varieties without full considerationas the ordinary channels of trade may suffice to supply all that isneeded. &apos;1-                           I am,                                Sir,             .v ,                     Your obedient Servant,                                         Director-GeneralRt.Hon.Rowland E. brothero, M.P. ,   -  President of the Boara. of Agriculture             and Fisheries.
