IRISH SITUATION.



Memorandum of the Lord Lieutenant.



The Sinn Fein victory in the East Clare is a fact of cardinal significance, and has precipitated events.

Following as it does on a course of extreme leniency and conciliation which culminated in the general amnesty of political prisoners and tacit tolerance of seditious and secessionist propaganda it marks the definite failure of that policy to rehabilitate constitutional nationalism or ? Sinn Fein ? to British rule. After making all deductions for local influences and the general revolt against the Redmondite party machine the fact remains that in a remarkably well conducted political content, sustained by excellent candidates on both sides,

the electors on a singularly frank issue of self government within the Empire versus an Independent Irish Republic, have overwhelmingly pronounced for the latter.

The amount of reality which the followers of this doctrine attack to its profession is evidenced by the armed attack on the police barracks at Ballybunion in Kerry on the night of the poll, which remitted in the killing of one of the assistants, and the minister disturbance in Ennis.

This premature ebullition may elicit no immediate imitation, but ? there is serious menace in the movement cannot for a ? be questioned.

More serious than armed attacks on, or armed resistance to, the police, is the prospect of an organised challenge to the civil government in the shape of an attempted republican assembly, refusal to pay taxes, &amp;c.

Whatever form opposition to the Executive may assume, it an evident that a condition has arisen in which it is no longer possible to subordinate the firm maintenance of law and order in the interests of a potential agreement by the Convention.

The Irish Government is non confronted with a situation in which at least half the non-unionist population have repudiated their ? to the law.

Mr. Le Valera, the successful candidate fir East Clare, speaking in Dublin on the 12th inst, claimed as the policy of his party, Complete Independence: Representation at the Peace Conference; Organisation and Arming, Physical force; the ? of the Protestant minority, and Resistance to taxes as in times past to rents.

If this is ?, in a few weeks the country may easily get out of hand and civil government be ?. The Executive has ample power: under the defence of the Realm Regulations and they should be exercised forthwith. While academic ? of republicanism may yet be ignored, incitement to violence, the adoption of military formation under words of command, and the wearing of uniform &amp;c., should become the object of active prosecution.

 
      At  tee  ssmso .time,  in view of  the  ireoent  tolerance of such acts in the past retrospective  action (with  the  exception of the&apos;&apos; events-&apos;at  ffinnis and; Bailybuni on) /would . savour-  of vindiotiwnoss.. - By a stater-soot in Parliament the  Government  .*nould. ^jive clear yarning. of - their&quot;:Intentions and should--&quot;definitely, state -that.&quot;under no circumstances will secession he  tolerated *      - .      Xnfrri fros? all other considerations such a state could, only- lead to &amp; bloody and devastating  civil  war.      A clear pronouncement on  this point is needed,    ven veil informed cnti  -sell affeoted persons-are  not without misgivings on the point, while ignorant parti  -ana  of the  extreme.: section, in view of happenings in Russia,  Poland and  olsewhere,  regard it m m eminently..&apos;-reasonable.-..an?i - &quot;practical&apos;&apos;.- oh j on ti ve.&apos;;&apos;- -&apos;.&apos; The findings: of the Convention n^irnt any -such  proposal  would  not be con- sidereeVhy. the advanced  party as&apos; disposing of  the  question.      In. illustration of this the following  quotation from the Irl oh Volunteer manifesto may.; he-: studied j- .           &quot;The Irish people have no voice, in  the  selection of            :  ;;;  the personnel of  this Convention,  which is              .  entirely in the hands of  the British- Cabinet,                who have arranged its constitution,   x ;&apos;  x  &apos; - x      .-;-&apos;.;;.&apos;---: They repudiatf a- Oonvention; whli;h: ie: controlled              .; and directed fey  England,  which has been foisted                on the Irish nation under the  protection of the                Defence  of the  Realm Act,  which  pos-ieasea neither                its sanction nor  its confidence, and which is; &apos;                not competent to  apeak  on its  behalf.
