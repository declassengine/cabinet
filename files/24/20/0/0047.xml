, S 3 C KB p G.T.1445   Joint Memorandum by -Director-General of National ServicePresident, kocal GoverWant BoardSecretary of State for WarSecretary of State for the ColoniesFood Controller        After careful consideration of the points whica werediscussed at the two meetings of the V.ar Cabinet on Fridaylest in connection with the 10th -deport ef the Director-General of National Service, and of the alarming evidence newavailable of the growing shortage in the crop of recruits ofo serviceable standard, we wish to urge upon the Cabinet thatthey should give their most earnest consideration to theproposals advocated on different grounds by represents,tiresof the Departments which are working in closest touch withthe recruiting problem.            &apos;  ....    -.   ..         r....        The proposals in brief aro that all Governmentexemj?tlen* given to men in the lower,military ages shall becanoelled (the right of exemption being retained only formen above the specified age) and thai &amp;3 many of these menas may be required fer military service shall be called upfrom time tc time; after reasonable notice, in age groups.Ho occupation or industry should be excepted from thegeneral rule, which should be of universal application.        The above, method appears to be the only one by whichmen of suitable quality and in adequate numbers can be obtainedfor the Army for the purposes-of next yoar?s campaign withcertainty and promptitude, and it is in our opinion tho onlyway of allaying the - state of idisaatisfaction with the presentsystem of recruiting whioh is rapidly extending throtighoutthe country.  It is pointed out by Tribunals that to take- olderand unsuitable men with heavy family and other responsibilitieswhile young men, often unmarried and of the most suitablequality for the Army, are left in their civil occupations,frequently in their immediate, nei^                only costlyand wasteful/to the State^ but gives rise to grievances and asense of injustice which may become dangeroua if the c*use isnot speedily removed.        IhP&quot; principal objections raised to the proposed methodare, firstly, that it would bo likely to create dimwith labour^ and secondly *. that it would Involve ft: diminutionof output in,matters of vital necessity.        Ijfr may *b** hoped that the anticipated difficulties*ith labour are exaggerated and that even if the young men,disBattgfied^ith the new system of. recruiting, aucoecded inproducing Itfoal strikes, such strikes could only he of shortduration, afc the whole popular feeling of the country would beso stawng^r against &quot;the; striker 8*.-,  &apos; generaa^rui^isuch &amp;e that^roposed:^ applicable to all alike,  would make it difflouit forany ojfa amoa or ^ISBS of men to claim a preference not grantedto any others.        A* regards the question of diminution of output it is theopinion of many oxporienoed manufacturers that there would be noappreciable diminution, as employers would Mow he forehand exactlywhat men they were gping to lose and what provision would-be
innecessary to make good the deficit.   further, it is to beremembered that the proposal would enable some of the oldergen, vfci at present are being taken for military service, to beused as substitutes for the younger men who would be taken for theranks.       Important industries requiring labour urgently,such as shipbuilding and agriculture, might be.to a con-siderable degree reinforced as required from the Army,which would be able to spare some if itsr older men formerlyengaged in these industries when assured of receiving theyounger men to take their places.       We are of opinion that if the crisis in connection  &apos;with recruiting artf the method which we recommend were fullyexplained to theKou3e^ of Commcns by the Prime Minister, thecountry aaa whole would! tte so strongly impressed by cheequitable and pracrtic^Me character of the method proposed^ thatany objection raised, by a minority of labour rould be overcome,and we urge the Cabinet to take the necessary stepa (includingpossibly the introduction of a Bill) for bringing the proposedmethod into operation without delay.

APPENDIX.       Extract from a Report by Mr. John Rowland,        ;the National Service Commissioner for Wales, giving a resumeof the proceedings at a Conference of Sub-Commissioners andArea Substitution Officers for Wales which was held atCardiff on the 26th June,  1917-       &quot;(13)   That there was g*eat and. general discontent atthe privileged position claimed by and conceded to specialclasses of workers (e.g.. Miners, Dockyard workers) and thatthis condition of affairs would continue to militate againstthe recruitment and supply of men for the army.   It wasconsidered that this was a question which should be taken inhand at once by the Government.&apos;  In this connection and forthis reason it may be stated that Military Tribunals inWales are becoming jestive and refuse to eit pending strongaction by the Government with respect to these privilegedclasses of labour.&quot;
