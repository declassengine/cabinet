Committee appointed by the Way Cabinet toinvestigate&quot; and report what step By. if any.could be taken to secure the quicker tnarn&quot;round of ships.   ;          &quot;   . ,    -V-T .. T...MUORITY REPORT BY SIR HOBMAB HILIu    (For Majority Report:see G. 5.1404).(Circulated with reference to War Cabinet 50t  Minute 10).       In the Memorandum the Shipping Controller placed beforethe War Cabinet at the Meeting at which the Committee wasappointed, it was stated:         &quot;It is of no use to speed up the discharge of    the ships so long as the railways are unable to carry    the cargo as discharged to its destination.   The    storage capacity of the ports is limited - quays,    transit sheds, and warehouses become blocked, and    discharge becomes impossible.   The rato of the    discharge of the ships must be equated to the rate    of the inland distribution of these cargoes&quot;.       The Shipping Controller^ Memorandum followed onthe decision at which the War Cabinet had arrived, inDecember 1916, to bring up immediately the strength ofthe Transport Workers1 Battalions to 10,000, and on communi-cations made by the Port and Transit Executive Committeeto the Railway Executive Committee in December 1916 andJanuary 1917, pointing out that, although that Committee wasat last in a position to assist to a substantial extent inregard IJFTOJYY^ur in the ports, such  assistance would be ofno avallycna until the Railway position was substantiallyimproved.               /       The allegation that the turn round of the ships wasdelayed by reason of the inability of the railway companiesto receive and forward the cargo as landed was challengedat the War Cabinet by the President of the Board of Trade,and, as I understood it, the Committee was appointed toascertain the facts before action was taken,on the Memorandumsubmitted by the Shipping Controller. &apos;       In my opinion the information obtained by the Committeeand its Visiting Sub Committee, and more especially theresults attained from the steps taken since&apos;the;be ginning ofthe present year, establish beyond question the accuracyof the Shipping Controller&apos;s contention.SB C B B TVG.T. 1493.

IN LIVERPOOL:        The Committee formed df the local representatives ofthe Great Western,  Cheshire Lines,  Great Central,  Great Northern,London &amp; North Western and Midland Railways reported:-        4th Deo * 1916*    &quot;Most of the Companies have experienced        a serious shortage of wagons, sheets and ropes, which        has necessitated curtailing acceptance and holding back        of traffic, including Government traffic,  Army food-        stuffs &amp;Co&quot;18th Deo,,. 1916.   &quot;The Companies have experienced a seriousshortage of wagons, sheets and ropes, attributable partlyto the severe fogs, and this has necessitated curtailingacceptance and the holding back Of traffic, includingGovernment traffic, Army and Civil foodstuffs &amp;c.&quot;2nd Jan,1917o    &quot;The Companies have experienced a seriousshortage of wagons, sheets and ropes.&quot;15th Janc1917a   &quot;It has again been necessary to regulatestringently the acceptance of full loads by means of thepermit system, especially owing to the shortage of wagonsand sheets.&quot;29th Jan.1917.   The report was in similar terms.12th Feb.1917.   &quot;During the first week of the fortnightWere was shortage of wagons, sheets and ropes with mostCompanies, but during the second week the position wasconsiderably improved by the Railway Companies makingincreased use of privately owned wagons, with the con-sent of the owners, for the conveyance of merchandise inthe direction of home, and also by the special effortsmade to secure empty wagons for Liverpool, even at theexpense.of other places.&quot;IN GLASGOW:        The  Railways wore  not  able to  take  the  traffic away  fromthe Docks as rapidly as  it was discharged.IN BRISTOL:        There was a constant  shortage  of empty wagons and  ofsheets for loaded wagons.        Further there was  evidenae^hefOore iihe &quot;Committeethat -13 LONDON:        The discharge of the wool was being seriously delayedowing to the inability of  the  Railway Companies to maintaina regular supply of empty  ivagons.
- 5 -       At the beginning of the year there was thereforea serious shortage of empty railway wagons available toremove promptly the cargoes from the pcrts.                                  -   -:      *&quot;       It was not suggested,  and it never has beensuggested,  that there was an^actual deficiency of wagonsin the country, but the Port &amp; Transit Executive Committeehad insisted since November 1915 that sufficient emptywagons could only be made available(a)   By the adoption of a system of pooling the Rail-     way Companies&apos;  own wagons,(b)   By the adoption of the practice of pooling the     covering sheets belonging to the Railway Companies(c)   By the use,  so  far as might be necessary,  of   -  the private  owned wagons.(d)   By restricting  the time under which wagons were     allowed-to remain under load.       All the suggestions have gradually been adopted,in whole or in part,  by the Railway Companies since thebeginning of 1916,  and a3 they have been acted on,  thesupply cf available empty wagons has steadily increased.Since January 1917 they have all been acted on,  in wholeor in part,  and since that date it has been the exceptionfor a shortage of empty Railway wagons to be reported inany port.       Further,  since the beginning of the year therehas been a marked improvement - in the despatch given tothe ships.  For example in Glasgow the average rate ofdischarge of the iron ore cargoes has increased as under:January 1917 - 572. tons per,day.February n   - 704   &quot;   &quot;   &quot;March          908   &quot;   &quot;   &quot;April    &quot;   -1204   &quot;   u   &quot;     ,  In the main these improvements have resulted fromthe additional labour, made available through the Trans-port Workers1 Battalions, the-number of days&apos;  work put  inby the men of the Battalions having been as under:-January 1917 -  57,549 days workFebruary  &quot;  -  98,613  &quot;     &quot;March     &quot;  - 120,643  &quot;     11April     &quot; : - 112,030  &quot;     &quot;May       M  - 141,273  &quot;     &apos;*June  .    &quot;  - 149,802  &quot;     *
        But this labour could never have been used if thesupply of available empty wagons had not been increased,and the men of the Battalions by assisting in the dischargeof the Railway wagons at the Steel borks, have assistedmaterially in increasing this available supply.  Theemployment of the Battalions has now been extended to theRailways and Canals and the results attained so far warrantthe belief that the experiment will prove successful.        Apart from the findings in regard tb the pointraised by the Shipping Controller, I am in disagreement withthe Committee, and more especially with the views expressedby the Visiting Sub-Committee, in regard to the steps bestcalculated to maintain the flow of traffic througi the ports,and therefore to secure the quicker turn round of the ships.        I venture to think that the Committee, and in especial,the Visiting Sub-Committee, in concentrating their attentionon the ports, have failed to face the real problem.        In my opinion the Transport Services, i.e.:-             The Ships,             The Ports,             The Railways and the other             land Transport Servicesare, and must always be, the servants of the Consignees;  andthe rate at which the ships are turned round in the ports, andthe rate at which the traffic flews through the ports and overthe railways, is, and must always be, dependent on the rateat which the imports pass into actual consumption.        Speaking generally, the more the Transport Services(whether the ships,  the ports or the railways) are used bythe Consignees as reservoirs from which  to supply their wantsfrom day to day, the more is the actual  carrying power  ofthose  services diminished;  but the Nation can only get thebest out of the Transport Services if  those Services are doingtheir  best to meet the needs of the Consignees whether forcarriage or storage  facilities.        In times of  peace the best was secured by competitionbetween the Transport Services who were  all endeavouring toearn their living by satisfying the Consignees, and I ao notbelieve that the Nation would be better  served by.attemptingto  eliminate all long established piactic&amp;s based: on the desireto  give the Consignees the services they want.  I agree that withthe demands made by  the war on the Transport Services the samefacilities cannot be given to the Consignees as in times ofpeaoe, and the real  problem is how to use such facilities as areavailable to  the best advantage for both transit and storagepurposes.        The State can help by securing for the TransportServices as favourable general conditions as are possible inthe presence  of war.  For example the State:-     A.       Can see that the British ships are employed in the        trades  in which they can carry the most cargoes in the        year.   This  is the policy of withdrawing the ships from        the long voyage trades., and concentrating on the North        Atlantic and other short voyage  trades.     B.       Can limit the imports to essential cargoes.        This  is the  policy of restricted imports.
        C.     Can retain sufficient labour to enable the            Transport Services to be effectively maintained.            This is the policy of exempting the Dock Labourers            and Railway men from Military Service and of            supplementing deficiencies through organisations            such as the Transport Workers Battalions.       .D.     Can make as many railway wagons as possible            available to meet the general necessities of the            Nation. This is the policy of pooling and of            taking over, as necessary, the privately owned            wagons.        E.     Can impose on Consignees.the obligation to            clear the imports promptly.  This is the policy            of imposing penal rents on goods left in the            ports or on the railways.            The State has at its disposal the necessarymachinary to enable it to enforce effectively these policies -Policies A &amp;   can be enforced through the Custom HouseOfficials - Policy C can be worked under the Army organiza-tion - Policy D can be worked through the Railway Executive.Policy E can be worked through the existing Dock Authoritiesand the Railway Executive.            When the State has done its best to secure ( onlines such a3 the above) the most favourable general con-ditions,  the interests directly concerned should in my opinionbe left to work out their own salvation.   For State Officialsto attempt to play Special Providence in regard to particulardifficulties that arise in regard to particular ships andparticular imports, does far more harm than good.            The State has not at its disposal any machineryenabling it to exercise an effective supervision over themanner in which the Transport Services, both as regardstransit and storage, are worked in detail * in other words,the State cannot exercise an effective supervision over theindividual ships, over the individual Port Authorities, andover the individual Railway Companies.  And State Officials..or Committees, by endeavouring to help the flow of trafficat one point, may cause hopeless confusion at some otherpoint and block the flow for days.            In so far as the State is directly concerned inparticular ships, or for example transports, or withparticular cargoes, as for example wheat or iron ore, theDepartment of State concerned directly with such3iip3 andsuch imports occupies the position of either shipowner orimporter, and it is for each of those Departments to seethat it gets the fullest advantage out of the general con-ditione under which the Transport Services have to be carriedon under v/ar conditions.            If the Transport Services are unable to meet allthe war demands, including the maintenance of the essential
supplies of the country, then the war demands as a wholemust ha brought within the compass of the Transport facilitietavailable,, but this cannot bo done by any regulation of theWork in. the ports.   It must be settled oh broad lines bythe War Cabinet, and each of the Departments concerned must*oWc within the limits imposed upon it by the War Cabinet.        I agree with the Visiting Sub Committee that,.sofar ae the Port Authorities are concerned,.it is necessary  ,that there should be a central body charged with the duty ofseeping &quot;in touch with the general situation as affecting*the transit system of the country and to provide a meane*of.guidance for local administration in matters which&quot;affect the national interest.&quot;   But I would point outthat the.Port &amp; transit Executive&apos; Committee have exercisedthese functions since its formation in November 1915*   The oiioy of that Committee, the steps it has taken since its ormatioh, and the result attained, were set out in detailin a Report which was placed before the Wat Cabinet inJune 1917 by the Shipping Controller.        if the existing Departmente of State or any of theexisting Committees charged with particular duties ate notcarrying out these duties effectively! then other Stateofficials and other members of those Committees should beappointed at once, but the multiplication of Committees shouldbe avoided as it weakens authority and causes needless delays.        Holding theee views :-   1.   ,    1 am of opinion that the question ef the man power .        to be employed on the Railways and in the Railway-        Repairing Shops ie a question that must be settled.        direetly between the War Office and the Railway        Executive, and, in the event of disagreement between,:,        those Departments, by the War Cabinet.   I do not. .        think the question ie one that oould with advantage        be dealt with by any outside Committee.   2.       1 am of opinion that all questions relating to the        employment of the men of the Transport Workers&apos;:        Battalions in the ports, on the railways, and on the        Canals should be left in the hande of the Port &amp;        Transit Executive Committee, so long as that Committee        efficiently discharges the duties entrusted to it.3*       I am of opinion that if the Railways or the Canals     want to obtain labour under the National Service Scheme,     the arrangementa should be made direct as between the.     Railway Executive or the Canal Committee and the     Director of National Service.    I do not think the     intervention of an outside Coionittee is of any advantage.4.       In my opinion the Admiralty, War Office, and the     Minietry of Munitions must each arrange direct with     the Shipping Controller or the Railway Executive     Committee the routing of the traffic in which they     are interested.   If all their demands cannot be met,     then the policy which oreates  those demands must be     brought by the War Cabinet within the compass of the .     Transport Services available.
     In my opinion the competing demands of thedifferent Departments in regard to accommodationim the ports should-be adjusted by tho Port &amp;Transit Executive Committee, so long as thatCommittee is effectively performing its duties.Delays and uncertainties are only created if anyof the Departments are placed in the position toappeal to art outside Committee.     I am opposed to the Port &amp; Transit ExecutiveCommittee appointing a representative in each ofthe ports.   The present &quot;practice is for eachPort Authority to report, day by day, to the Port&amp; Transit Executive Committee, and that Committeeworks with and through the Port Authority and itspolicy has been to maintain the authority and tosecure the cordial co-operation of the Port Authority.     I do not believe that any good results wouldfollow from establishing a new Committee to co-ordinatethe conflicting demands made on the TransportServices by the Admiralty, War Office, the Ministryof Munitions, the Shipping Controller, the PoodController, and all the other Departments of State.It is true that these demands are often in conflictone with the other but such conflicts cannot be dealtwith and solved as merely transport questions.     The evidence placed before the Committee doesnot in my opinion justify the reflections made inthe Report upon the Clyde Trust.   I believe it wouldbe disastrous to force upon that Trust representativesof the Ministry of Munitions and the General Managerof the Port of Greenock.     I agree that in the port of Manchester it ismost desirablo to obtain cordial co-operationbetween tho local interests, and I believe thatthis has been secured in great measure.   I amvery doubtful as to the amount of success whichcould be obtained in applying anything in thenature of compulsion.     In regard to the Deep Water Berths at theAlbert Dock, no question has ever been raised beforethe Port &amp; Transit Executive Committee, althoughon that Committee the War Office, the Admiralty, theShipping Controller, the Railway Executive and thePort of London Authority are directly represented.If the present members of the Port &amp; TransitExecutive Committee are incapable of dealing withsuch a question, then new members should beappointed.     If the three Committees directly charged withthe maintenance of the flow of traffic, namely,the Railjfray Executive Committee, the Port &amp; TransitExecutive Committee, and the Canal Committee,  or anyof them, are not fully and effectively discharging
the duties imposed on them, the necessary changesshould be at once made in the members of thoseCommittees.   In my opinion no useful purpose wouldbe served by continuing a Committee charged with theduty bf supervising the work done by these ExeoutiveCommittees.   On the other hand the Continuance inoffice of such a Committee must hamper the work ofthese Executive Committees.(Signed)   NORMAN HILL.19th July,  1917.
