BUTE PJ1P0RT. BT TE3. BOARD OP THAU ON IMPORTS AND        IM2U3TRI IN RELATION- TO SHIPPING,rp-^K^^eport has been prepared &apos;on.imports and industryin relation to shipping, which shows the position at theend of June,-  The outstanding points seem to be:-(l);      The reduction in tons of goods imported as     compared with the. corresponding periods of 1916     and 1913 was the largest that has yet occurred in any     month.  As against June 1916 it was, including main-     itions on Government account, .1,055,000 tons,  or     25%, whereas in May it was,  on the same basis, only     379,000 tons or 10%,   when, as - ^as done in the last     Report,  munitions on Government account are excluded,     the showing for June is still vTorsa,(2)       The claims made to the Shipping Priority     Committee exceed the estimates  of possible imports     made by Sir Alfred V-atson and i^r.Slderton in their     latest Report by 550,000 for each.of July and     August,  by 700,000 tons for September and by &apos;     1,000,000 tons for each of the  remaining months\:o  of 1917.                            &apos; *&quot;(3)       In June the imports placed upon the restricted     list were dom by 678,000 tons  or 7QJS&apos; as against     June 1916 and by 8($ as against 1913,    The  imports     of unrestricted goods excluding munitions on     Government account were down by 586,000 tons or 19%     a^-against 1916 and by 22$ as against 1913, and,     including munitions on Government  account they were     down 378,000 tons or 1$ as  against 1916 and by/                          (1)
by    as against 1913.   The extra percentage fallfor both 1916 and 1913 in June as compared with Mayis greater for unrestricted than for restrictedgoods.  This suggests that the contraction inrestricted goods is approaching its liinit andthat the main part of any further reduction inimports will have to be borne by unrestricted goods.Among restricted goods the most notable changein June has been the further heavy contraction on1916 in imports of timber.Among unrestricted goods, the imports of grain andflour in June were 56,000 tons above what they werein June 1916, whereas in May they had been 103,000tons  bove the 1916 figure;    Pood in general was3% down on 1916 instead of 2% up as in May,    Inraw materials as a whole there was a decrease on1916 of 440,000 tons or 31$, a ve*ry much largerdecrease than had occurred in any previous month.In the Report a detailed enquiry is made concerningcertain commodities of ^ich the import has beenlargely reduced.  The problem of cotton has beenmet by the establishment of a Board of Control.The position with regard to motor spirit and kerosenethe stocks of which were already dangerously low in Mayis now still more serious-Jfor June as for previous months, the reduction asagainst  1913 in tons of goods  imported was muchless than the reduction: of tonnage  entrances  (withcargo).   But whereas in May the ratio of importsto entrances was also much better  than it was  in1916, in June the improvement  on that year was
 very small. As against  1913 the  improvement in June was much less .than in May. In June the entrances of British vessels,  exclusive of certain special requisit ioned vessels  of which returns are how for  the first time available, were 1,618,000 tons (i.s. 11$ less than in June 1916). - The percentage reduction as against 1916 is larger than it has been in  any month except March. . This . is also true of foreign entrances.   British clearances on the same basis were 1,276,000 tons (i.e. Zl% less than  in June 1916).  The percentage reduction is larger  than in any  other month:, Foreign: clearances continued the &quot;steady, improvement which they have been showing since February..  They were 814,000 tons (i.e. 47$ less  than in June 1916).    Foreign clearances (with cargo) are,:rougjily speaking, &apos; double of foreign entrances (with cargo).   -   ... Much the larger part of the aggregate reduction  in entrances and clearances as compared with  1916 was still in June due to foreign vessels.   Among these foreign vessels it is still the  neutrals  that  have&apos; contracted their entrances most.  But in June  there was a considerably larger percentage decline as against 1916 (i.e.37^)  in the entrances of Allies other than the United States than had occurred in any previous month;  while  the percentage, decline  in United States vessels (69/0 was  actually larger than that in neutrals - in consequence probably  of the absorption of American tonnage in the  transport of troops.
      On December 31st,  1917,  the  tonnage  of British \ vessels over 1,600 tons completed,;not  repairing and actually ready for use  was  16,598,000 tons.  By  May 31st,  it had been reduced to 14,949,000 tons, and by June 30th to approximately 14,680,000  tons.  On May 31st  the tonnage not  occupied in the service of  the Army  and Navy, Colonies, Allies  and so forth, and, therefore, available for  the ordinary  trade   (including the  bulk  of the munition imports)  of the United Kingdom was  6,163,000 tons as against 6,917.000 tons on December 31st.  Thus a reduction of 10$ in ^g^e^te tommge ready for use had meant a reduction  of 11$ in tonnage available for ordinary trade.  This latter reduction would have needed to be much greater but  for the fact that many vessels were withdrawn from permanent service abroad and from the  service ofOolonies and Allies  It i^s probable that any further. reducti on in aggregate&apos; tonnage ready for use will fall in-^larger proportion upon the tonnage left over for  trade. .     If  the same amount of British tonnage is destroyed in the  second half of 1917 as was destroyed in the  firsthalf, - and since the submarine war only ])QGme weaatipg in Mar&quot; eh, it is not improbable that more will in fact  bedestroyed, - the  new gross losses will amount to about 2tmi Hi on tons (mailing 4J- milli on  tons  during the year).It seems likely that to this 2i million  a  further t million- tons should be added to allow for  a probable increasein the vessels vatfrdrawn from use  to be  repaired after &quot;unsuccessful&quot; submarine attacks.   Against  the  2f million tons thus arrived at,  it is  estimated  that,  according  topresent arrangements,  new vessels  will be completed toBritish  order amounting, from home yards to  about1,100,000 tons,.and from foreign yards to  325,000 tons.                    &apos;           &apos;                A further   ,
     A further net reduction of British t onnage  of more     than one million tons may,  therefore,  he looked  for by     the end of the year.  Even if  from that time onwards     new construction kept pace  with losses, this would probably     mean,  in view of the reduction of  foreign entrances,  that     our imports,  including munition imports, in 1918 would have     to be  reduced 30^ below what they were in 1916.(ll)        - It  is understood that  the United States Government     is making arrangements for  a large  ship-building programme,     but it must be remembered that the  maintenance of the     American Army in  Surope will absorb a large amount of tonnage.     It appears1  therefore that the  only way to prevent an     alarming reduction iii 1918  in  the imports required for the     civilian needs of this country, is  to arrange for^a greatly     extended scheme of shin-buildi;:g in British yards,     The programme  of  the Controller of Shipbuilding,  which     seeks  to provide  for a construction rate of a little over     3 million tons a year,  appears to be an absolutely     essential minimum.                       &apos;                    13th July, 1917.
