Circulated by the Secretary of State for India to the Cabinet.INDIAN  REFORMS.Grant  of Commissions to  Indians.   On entering  into  office  I  find  the following  completed  note  by mypredecessor.  I entirely agree with  Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s view and trust thatthe Cabinet will be able to consider the question at an early date.                                                            E.S. M.   20th July 1917.   I circulate to the  Cabinet a Memorandum on  the  grant of  King&apos;sCommissions to Indians and correspondence with the  Army  Council on thesubject.  A Cabinet decision is necessarv.                                                               A.  C.   10th July 1917.MEMORANDUM.   The question of granting King&apos;s commissions to Indians has been  underconsideration for many years, both in India and at home ;  but no progresshas been made with it owing to the  unwillingness of the War  Office toconcede the principle of giving Indians command over  Europeans.  Variousalternatives and compromises have been discussed.with  a  view to avoidingthis&apos;difficulty,  but all have been discarded, partly on purely military grounds.partly because it was clear that none of them would satisfy the genuineambition for a military career which has undoubtedly been growing inrecentyears-especially in the aristocratic families of Native States as  wellas of British India.   This ambition has been further stimulated by the war,while the right of the Indian gentleman to take his  place beside his whitefellow-subjects in the. King&apos;s Army is claimed as included in the conceptionof India&apos;s &quot; partnership &quot; in the British Empire, on which it is  based in theprogramme of  the best and  most moderate Indian politicians.   Recognising this fact,  the Government of India have included  the grant           n       -,.              of King&apos;s commissions in the scheme           oee Appendix.               n  n- -  i   i    i  -  - .   .*      p               1 r                 oi political and  administrative reformswhich they have submitted for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Government of India have recommended that  Indian youths who bybirth, character, and  education are fitted to aspire to high  military rankshould be  given the  opportunity of  obtaining commissions  in the Army.The actual scheme proposed by the Viceroy is that 10 vacancies at Sandhurstshould  be  allotted to Indians for this purpose.  Candidates  would benominated by the Local Governments and recommended by the Commander-in-Chief for the approval  of the Viceroy. The  approved  candidates wouldcompete for the Sandhurst examination, and those qualifying for  admissionup the number of vacancies allotted would join as Cadets and be eligible forcommissions.   After  prolonged  consideration  and  discussion  with  myCouncil I informed the Government of India that I was prepared to supportproposals on these lines, and the Government  of  India are to formulate acomplete scheme to give effect to them.    To meet the claims of Indian soldiers who have entered the  army throughthe ranks in the hope  of  obtaining commissions, it is  proposed to establishmilitary schools in India.    With a view to  establishing  the principle of granting commissions toIndians it was suggested that  commissions should be  conferred at an early
date on a few Indian officers specially selected from officers holding commis-sions  in  the Indian land forces or honoraiy  commissions, and from Indianofficers with Indian  regiments.  It is recognised that the latter class (subjectto rare exceptions) have not the education  or standing that would fit themfor  combatant commissions;  and to compensate them for their  exclusion, itis proposed to grant  to  Indian officers  of specially  meritorious servicehonorary commissions as captains  or  lieutenants while still on the activelist, instead. of as hitherto only after retirement.  The Viceroy has  nowrecommended nine  officers holding commissions in  the Indian land forcesfor commissions as captains and lieutenants in recognition of their servicesin the present war, and it is only as regards these officers that  the proposalto confer commissions has as yet taken definite shape. &apos;   Pending receipt of the Government of India&apos;s detailed proposals it is notpossible to establish a regular scheme for the grant of commissions to Indiansas many  complicated questions, such  as the provision of  training.in India,are involved.    The correspondence with the War  Office which is printed below ensued.         LETTER FROM INDIA OFFICE  TO WAR OFFICE (M.  19105),    -                    DATED 1ST JUNE 1917.Sir,                                         \::.       With reference to your  letter No. 100/India/621 M.S. 1, India, dated15th  March  1916, I am directed to forward copy of a  telegram  from theViceroy (Army Department), No. 7688, dated 26th May, putting forward thenames of nine officers of the Native Indian land forces  for commissions inthe Indian Army.                         &quot;    The Army Council are aware that the principle of the granting of Iving&apos;scommissions  to Indians has  been under discussion in India for a good manyyears past, and it has been examined from every possible point of view.  -    The considerations mentioned in your.letter of 15th March 1916 have notbeen overlooked, and I am to explain that a large programme of constitu-tional reforms, in recognition of the  part played by India during the warand of her legitimate  hopes and aspirations is now before His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment.  It is in this connection that the Government of India in a           fiM Appendix.          ;  \ despatch from which  the relevant ex-                                   tracts are enclosed (No.  17  of  24thNovember 1916, paragraphs 16-18)-have formally proposed the grant ofKing&apos;s commissions to natives of India.    In view of the difficulty of supplying sufficient officers of pure European.descent to the Indian Army, of the effect on recruiting of the racial bar, ofthe Government of  India;s  strong  recommendation,  of  the  widespread demand in India for higher military employment for Indians, and of India&apos;s services to the Empire during the war, Mr. Chamberlain is convinced  that the time has arrived  when  the principle of the granting of King&apos;s corn- missions to Indians  must be admitted.  He has therefore been  examining afresh with  the Government of India how best to give effect to it, and the           .-,  ,T ,   - . ,  v          &apos; enclosed recent correspondence1  will        &quot;.- - 1  JNot reprinted,             -i       r.  A - .,     ,i ------ j-         ,                 1             :    snow what  stage  the discussion- has reached, and will prove to the Army Council  that the matter has been given prolonged and very earnest  consideration both in India and in London.  It is, of course, realised: that the granting of  King&apos;s commissions  to natives of India may involve the placing of Indians  in positions from which they will be entitled to command Europeans at some future date, that  to do so  must be considered in the nature of an experiment, and that we have no precedent to guide us in the matter. /But the experiment is not one  that can lead to. sudden catastrophe, and it is proposed to initiate it on a small scale and to watch:it carefully during its gradual development.    Mr. Secretary Chamberlain accordingly hopes that the Army Council will now accept the principle, and will  approve the only part  of the scheme to
which effect can be given at once, namely the grant of commissions  in theIndian Army to the  nine  officers of the Native Indian land forces  whosenames are now submitted by the Government of India for that honour.  Hewould suggest that that part of the proposals which relates to the selectionand training of the Indian cadets should he reserved for consideration laterafter receipt of the despatch containing the full scheme from the Governmentof India.      : t   . The most  suitable  method  of giving effect to the present  propositionwould seem to be to post these nine Indian officers to the Unattached Listand then to gazette them to the Indian Army.  This would appear to meetthe pro visions.of Article 35 of the Royal Warrant 1914.   LETTER FROM WAR  OFFICE  TO  INDIA OFFICE (100/India/1880 M.S. 1),                         DATED 5TH JULY  1917.Sir,,                     ,    &apos;                                   s  ,&apos;      With reference to your letter No. M.: 19105 of the 1st  June 1917, onthe subject of granting commissions  in the Indian Army to  nine officers ofthe Indian land forces, I am  commanded  by the Army Council to informyou  that  after the  most  careful consideration they  have  come  to  theconclusion that to grant commissions to natives of India  would entail a greatrisk from a military point of view, in that it  involves placing native Indianofficers in  a position where they would be entitled  to command Europeanofficers.    For  this  reason,  the  Council  are not  prepared to  take theresponsibility of advising such a step.   The  Council further  suggest  that the question might be deferred forconsideration at the close  of  the war, together with many other Imperialmatters affecting the Army as a whole, all of which  will then be broughtforward for review.SS 573
APPENDIX.         EXTRACT  FROM DESPATCH OF  GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, DATED  .         - &apos;24TH NOVEMBER  1916, PARAGRAPHS 16-18.  :    16. The rewards that we have thus far enumerated involve no change inthe constitution  of the Indian Army.  But the war  is bringing within thehorizon problems of Army reorganisation which may result in very wide andradical alterations in the existing system, and one of the most important ofthe questions that will call for  early settlement is whether the time has notcome for opening to Indians British  commissions in His Majesty&apos;s Army.Such a  step  forward,  although  primarily  the most  striking recognitionpossible of the services of the Indian  Army, would at the same time removea grievance long felt and in many quarters resented  ; it would also form anappropriate part of the policy of  admitting Indians  to  the higher ranks ofthe public services.  It would, in  fact, fall within all the three categories ofrecognition described in an earlier paragraph.    The removal of this bar before the war might not from the point of viewof the Indian Army have been received with quite unmixed satisfaction.The present generation  of Indian  officers and men  have grownup in theexisting  system ; they regard with respect and attachment the British officersunder whom they serve, and under whose fathers, in many cases, their ownfathers had also served before them, and before they  would have  been readyto welcome officers of Indian race, they would have liked to know what sortof men these would be and from what races and classes they would be drawn.Of the many gallant Subadars and Risaldars serving in  the Army but fewcould be found qualified  by age and  education for selection to  the Britishcommissioned ranks.   The  question  to  them  was,  therefore, not one  ofj)ressing and personal interest;  and it is correct to say that before the warthe demand for commissions for Indians was  a  great deal stronger  fromoutside than from within the Army itself.  This has  all been changed fromthe day that the  Indian regiments valiantly passed through their baptism offire on European battlefields.  They have seen&apos;how quickly their  small bandof British officers can be swept away; they have seen or heard  that in theFrench and Russian armies  men  of the African and Asiatic regiments mayrise to  full commissioned rank.  They have seen Turkish officers bravelyleading their troops in the most modern warfare, and they must  ask them-seives why to Indians alone this privilege should be denied.    While, however, they have realised their worth it is well to use  plainwords to represent plain truths they have also  realised  their limitations.While, on the one side, for the  first time they have felt the proud privilegeof fighting for the very  liberties of  the Empire, on the other  they  haverealised, as never before, the mighty resources of that Empire, the fortitudeand numbers of its men, and its almost limitless capacity for producing gunsand all the engines of war.  We trust that the time may never come whenserious  and organised attempts by enemies within our borders  may sorelytempt the Indian troops from their allegiance, but, if unhappily such effortsshould be made, the Army will know,  as it never knew before, the utter follyof any such treasonable designs.  The war has, indeed, at one  and the sametime established the case for the new privilege, and removed one of the oldcauses of apprehension which for so long  has barred the way.  .17. On the other grounds for the grant  of this  privilege  we need  notdwell at length.   The opening of a higher military career to their sons wouldbe welcomed by all Indian fathers who have  been  connected with the xArmy,-by the landed aristocracy, and by many who have attained eminence in  otherwalks of life.  By Indians at large it would  be welcomed as the removal ofa bar which has  been felt to be  a&apos; slur upon  their loyalty and capacity.  Togrant it would be in keeping, to refuse it inconsistent, with the whole policywhich underlies our recommendations. -
    While we &quot;advocate-&quot;unhesitatingly, the taking of this step, we do not fail to  recognise how many and  how great are the obstacles that stand in the way.  It is impossible for us to submit to you at this stage any detailed and considered scheme for carrying out this most important recommendation. We apprehend, though we have no information on the subject, that great and important changes will be effected in the whole  military system of the Empire  as a consequence of the war.  From these changes India, and the Indian Army, cannot stand, aloof.   They may have a vital bearing, not upon the principle of our proposal, but upon the methods whereby our object may best be  achieved.   Further  there  are social difficulties to be surmounted, and problems of training to be solved.  Even among those who know India and the  Indian Army best  widely different  opinions are  held.   Some advocate the training of Indian cadets who  shall in time completely officer Indian regiments specially constituted for  this  purpose; others lay great stress  on the intermingling of British and Indian officers in the same units. Some advocate the foundation of an Indian Sandhurst.; others insist that the training  should  be carried out in England, as an indispensable condition to its  success.  Others  again would  lay stress Upon the young cadets of both races being trained  together  in whichever  country  that training may take place,  in the belief that it is in early youth that they can  best learn to appreciate each  other&apos;s merits and understand each other&apos;s idiosyncracies.    18. We cannot yet offer final  opinions on these  and kindred points of difficulty, but we shall  lose no time in investigating these most  important questions.   We  consider, however, that  at the  time  when the grant of this privilege is announced in  general  terms,  it would  be most prudent to  use words  of caution.  The efficiency of the Army must not be jeopardised by too rapid an advance on untried  ground, and the numbers to be admitted must at first be comparatively few, and on a scale  that is tentative, until practical experience has shown us how to  secure the best material, how best to train it, and how best it may be utilised.    We must not forget that,  even in the sphere of civil employment,  the present stage of progress towards  the  free  admission  of Indians was  not reached at once ; the beginnings were small, and the process a slow one. In the  Army the issues at  stake are more vital, and the consequences of a false step more disastrous,  the need of good leadership is more essential, the: disciplinary relation between superior and subordinate is much more strict, and the social intercourse between men of different race in the same service necessarily closer, than is the case in  civil life.    It is not by ignoring these difficulties, but  by facing them frankly, and by patiently solving them, that the best hope of success lies for this new andstriking departure that we  so earnestly commend to your attention.
