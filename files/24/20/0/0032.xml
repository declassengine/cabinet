prom     Colonel  Spiers.                     July 16th 1917;.                                    /Handed in 1*55 p&amp;mBJo --!&quot;*&apos;    C*:I(.C*So;.                         &apos;4103 3,, S* 366*The following  message  is. from General  Pooh.&quot; .; Poll owing message received from General Cadorna $-     &quot;The successful  development.of Russian offensive justifies     suppositions foreseen by us  that  in near future-a situation     similar to that which I  foresaw in my telegram. ITo, 2979. GM June     26th, (in  which we asked  Prance and England to supply  25 batteries     and 132000 rounds) may arise on .the front of the Julian AlpSo     I may state  too that from information received and  by direct     observation  of movements behind the lines,  the first  symptoms  of     this are  already-visible,  Consequently the necessity of putting     forward the  date  of  our  offensive as much as possible is evident     and on the other  hand on account  of our munitions crisis which the     recent help  from  Prance  and  England reduced but did not solve  it     seems as  if  the offensive in question cannot be begun before the     end of August.  In my telegram quoted above I have  already shown;     you that  100 guns with 1000  rounds each are absolutely necessary     to  make updeficiency of munitions.  But if General  Petain cannct     spare the batteries  which have been asked for and considers they     can be better  employed, on the  Pranco-British front  I  must point     out the serious consequences which the  common cause of  the Allies     may suffer by-not taking advantage of the particularly  favourable     strategical  situation now developing on the front of  the Julian     Alps and  by giving up the advantages of a simultaneous  attack  with     necessary means on both  Austrian  fronts.  In- any case  if  decision     of: the General Staff is  irrevocable kindly communicate  above     message to General Poch  and  ask him to  use his  influence with                                                 :   General  .
wSSSMSSS     tilltl   (General Hobertson - to accept;responsibility of finding at least part of   batteries which we have asked for and to  the supplying of which to my   certain knowledge the British Government  is in favour of.&quot;       On account of result  already obtained by Russian offensive and of   declaration cf General Brousiloff that this is the only offensive   which he is able tf make this year,  it seems of the highest importance   to me that the Italian offensive should take place during first days   of August and that General Cadorna should at least receive part of the -  batteries asked for by him.   He must net he given a reason whether   real or otherwise not to attack at the right moment.       This is now agreed to by General Be tain who has put at my :. disposal for immediate -conveyance to Italy 6 batteries, 155 C   Schneider, 6 mortars calibre   37, 4  mcrtars calibre 370, total 34gun So     It is important, if you approve,  that  you should send, withoutdelay to General Cadorna the batteries asked for by him through mymedium, after interview at St. Jean Be Maurienne. Ends.
