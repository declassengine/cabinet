S EC RET.OPERATIONS..From: G.G.C-in-CEgypt.12th July, 1917oTo:C.I.G.S.7o5oP,meE.A.40.        I have just returned from the Palestine front andnow submit my appreciation and proposals in accordancewith your instructions,,       It appears te me that the Turkish Gcverrment haverealized that the loss of Jerusalem added to the fall ofBaghdad would produce disastrous results for them. Theyhave, therefore, determined to oppose -further progress onour part to the best ef their power.  The positions atpresent occupied by the Turks on the Gaza Beersheba lineare of considerable natural strength and from lack ofwater we are for the moment unable to approach withinstriking distance except near the sea ccast in one smallsector.,      The enemy&apos;s position runs from .the sea at Gazaroughly along the main Gaza Beersheba road to Beersheba,a distance cf about 30 miles, He is, therefore, widelydispersed but his lateral communications are good and hecan very; quickly reinforce any threatened point.  He hasmade. Gaza into a strong modern fortress heavily wired.andentrenched,  Its centre is a mass of houses, gardens andCactus hedges offering every facility for protracted,defenc^e^-The rest of his line consists cf a series cf stronglocalities mostly about 1500 - 2000 yards apart, viz: theSihan group of works, the Atawijieh^group, the Baha group,the
the Abu HereIra trench system and finally the works coveringBeersheba itself * .   My first impression is that the mostvulnerable point in the enemy1 s ; line is probably the sectorHereira Irgeig where his works are less highly organised.than:th$se directly north and where further his main system is com-pletely dominated from.the higher ground between Irgeig andBeersheba.  ..                        &apos;                          &apos;             In southern Palestine the onamy1s;force isestimated at 5 divisions and 1 Cavalry division in the front:line f with at least - ene additional; division in reserve south;of Jerusalem.    This^; with unattached units, ;:represents- atotal fighting force of, roughly,, 46,000 rifles, 2,800 sabres.250 machine guns and 200 guns *      As regards reinforcementsthe 26th Division is definitely reported en route to Palestinealso one regiment of the 46th Division.             I have immediately available against his force4 divisions and 3 cavalry divisions, exclusive of the 60thDivision, which ia in process of equipment on arrival fromSalonika and the 75th Division which, for some months; willbe unfit to take the field,     Units are, however:, be.lewstrength and to complete the 4 divisions and mounted troopsnow in the line to full strength X new require 5,153 Infantryand 4-CO Yeomanry reinforcements.             In the above figures the reinforcements of theInfantry of&apos; the 60th Division, which is only now arriving, andof the battalions of the 75th Division new in this country,are not included;    I estimate them at about another 2,000men.             At present it does not appear to have been decidedby the Turks-German General Staff whether their offensive inAsia Kinor shall be made against Baghdad or cn the Palestinefront.    It seems that the decision will .probably be infavour of an offensive Campaign against Baghdad.      My                                                      own
own view as regards Turkish intention in Palestine is thatthey wi 11 remain gener ally, on - the. defensive, and wi 11confine any offensive that may..be undertaken to an attempt, &apos;which I can frustrate, to drive us back to the Egyptianfrontier..   The railway line east of the Canal cansupply 7 divisions, 3 Cavalry divisions and the necessaryproportion of army troops.   With, this force I couldnow undertake an offensive with a reasonable prospect ofsuccess, but the divisions must be fully equipped andmaintained at full strength;At the end of this telegrammy requirements, in addition to what I have now at my disposalare enumerated.   In the 7 divisions referred to above I donot include - the 75 th Division,  whi c h has as ye t no artilleryand only 9 battalions of infantry, and which, owing to theweakened state * of the battalions, will not be ready to takethe field till December at the earliest.   Assuming that theenemy&apos;s force in front of me is not materially increased, Ishould hope, with 7 divisions and 3 Cavalry divisions, to beable to take Gaza and Beersheba.   I might also be able toreach Jerusalem, y For any operations beyond the Jaffa-Jerusalem line, and perhaps to maintain that line, I shallneed a considerable addition to my strength,-   This willnecessitate the doubling of the railway east of the Canalwhich should be at once undertaken.   It would take about6 months from the commencement of work to double the line ;to Rafa,   Therefore the sooner the line is doubled thebetter, as such a line will certainly be required.  This will.also involve the doubling.of the pipe line.   It is importantthat I  should have the troops I ask for ready for an advancein September, so as to anticipate the October rains; otherwiseoperations on a large scale could not well be commencedbefore November 1st.:   If it is impossible owing to therequirements
 requirements  sf  ether theatres to  send me  the  troops I ask for. minor  operations only will be possible,    With 5 divisions and 3  Cavalry Divisions  which, apart from the 75th Division, represents my present  strength,  I could only expect to achieve local successes *   In this theatre great: possibilities are before us, but boyond taking any steps necessary to  improve my present position,  I think it would be an error t o undert ake minor ope rat i ons  with we ale force s.        As regards the organization of my  Palestine force I propose to  form 2,Corps and 1Cavalry Corps,  all three directly under G-,H.Q,   To enable  me,to control these Corps in the field  I have decided to divide  my Headquarters * The major part will move to the neighbourhood  of Khan Yunis while the remainder,  comprising representatives of Administrative-Services-and Departments and such portions of my Staff as are required to deal with the administrative and political questions involved.in the control of ISgypt and the administration pf martial  la?;, will remain in Cairo/ In a subsequent telegram which will be despatched at an early, date, I will forward my detailed proposals together with the Commanders and Staffs required under this reorgan- iZationV;   I hope also, in due course, to  forward to you a re pert on man-power    My immediate  requirements are  as follows:-   ^&apos;   Division,  2 fully trained divisions, each with 36 18-pounder and 12 4.5&quot; howitzers, B,A,C, and With c  light (Stokes) and 3 medium (2n) Trench * ortar batteries, .   B.   Artillery, 1*  Field Artillery:  I  consider all divisions in&apos;this &apos; theatre should have 56 IS-potmders  and 12 4.5rt howitzers.   I therefore require to complete  my present divisions - 8. 4-guh ..4v5n howitzer &quot;batteries,  52  howitzers/-5. 6-gun 18-pounder &quot;batteries,   50 guns.                  .2. Heavy Artillery,. &apos; In laeavy and:                                                      siege;
siege artillery I estimate my requirements to be in theproportion of 4 60-pounders, 8-6&quot; howitzers to 8&quot; howitzers4: A.A.guns per division and in addition 1 A.A. Section foreach kite balloon section.   Therefore, in addition toheavy artillery already arrived or promised, totalling 266:&apos; ho-jitzers, 4 8&quot; howitzers, 24 60-pounders and 14 A,A.guns, I require the following:- 2 60-pounder batteries,8 guns; 9-1 6&quot; howitzer batteries, 58 howitzers; 3 8&quot;howitzer batteries, 12 howitzers; 13 A.A.sect ions 26 guns(includes 8 for kite balloon sections).   These figuresinclude heavy and A,A,artillery for 75th Division. I shouldalso be glad of 4 6&quot; mark 7 guns.   This heavy artilleryto be organised in 6 groups for which, in addition to the3 now formed or promised, 3 additional group Headquarterswill be required.  C. Aircraft.  Under the new organisation I estimate mytotal requirements to be not less than 5 squadrons, onefor each of my 3 Corps, one fighting squadron and one forG-.H.Q..  I regard this as a matter of vital importance asto employ my heavy artillery to the best advantage I mustensure command of the air, and I must have machines of thelatest types, as I cannot continue to be opposed by enemymachines superior to my own. My requirements are, therefore,3 additional squadrons, plus one flight to replace the flightdetached from one of my present squadrons for service inthe He&amp;jaz.--/-ASignal?  B.  Secret Service,   I require immediately 2 completeCorps Signal Companies with horse transport and 1 heavyartillery signal section, also 2 wireless sections of CorpsSignal Company.  Towards these I am prepared to form 1Corps Signal Company and the heavy artillery signal sectionfrom recently arrived reinforcements and men withdrawn fromother arms and trained here.      Signal personnel to                                                   replace
  replace  reinforcements  absorbed by the  formation of these  units will, &quot;however,; be required immediately.    We  shall  therefore  require:from  another  theatre  1  complete horsed  Corps Signal  Company and the  S  southern sections of Corps  Signal Company.     B.R.E.  Service.    I  shall require  S  army  troops::  companies  H.B.  to  meet  increased work on  the 1.  of  C    -      Medical.:    To  meet the increase,  in my forces  my medical requirements are S General Hospitals,  E  Stationary Hospitals, S Casualty Clearing Stations,.  4 Sanitary Sections,  in addition to units already promised  or despatched.   As  regards the  above demands (with the  exception  of  one 60-pounder or  6&quot;  howitzer  battery  per  divi si on,  which should  be horsed),  all  unit s should be  sent  fully: horsed  and;heavy artillery units complete with      j,  tractors and  caterpillar trucks.[i11
