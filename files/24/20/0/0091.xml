- , ;3B0S g:uG.T.-1489        NAVAL VALUE OF&apos;THE ISLAND OF SPITZRBRGSN.      Cojuy^of letter ?.ate&apos;3. 2gad July., 1917.v.frpmjbheM,09003/17.405         Dear Hahkey,                 with  reference to  your  letter  of  the 11th July,i      .  enclosing copy  of  Colonel  YateTs  letter3  of the 5th July51.1330.   about  Spitsbergen,  this  question  has  once more been       -  carefully examined, by tho  Naval Staff-            2.-*  The Admiralty are  not  directly concerned in the         political and&quot; commercial aspects&apos;, of the matter, but &quot;they .. .      ...  .believe it would be politically inopportune to seize by .&quot;.         force  a wireless station whichthe Norwegian Government         have guaranteed that the:/  have  already dismantled,  and they         have considerable  doubts,  not  as  regards  the mineral wealth         of Spitzbergen,  but as  to  the  accessibility of that wealth         as a commercial proposition, - and  further  as to the  financial         motive for all  this agitation.            3i-  However this may be,the point  on  which the  opinion         of the Admiralty is really required is as to the Naval&apos;value         of the Island,  and on this point  our  opinion Is as  follows:-.                 The  strategic position  of Spitzbergen as regards         this country  is unimportant.   It  does  not actually command         any trade route, though  it is  fairly  well-placed with         respect to the  trade route to  the Murman  coast and  to the         White  Sea.  It  is  without  an ice-freo  port, and at  the best         its harbours  aro only available for from  three to four         months every  year;   in  the summer of  1915 vessels which were         sent to Spitzbergen (in  August) could not get near  it for         the ice.  It  is not well placed for use as a base for         operations against Great Britain, whoever owns it  Spitzbergen         is dependent  on oversea  suppliesr- and is  consequently of         doubtful value  as  a base,  unless  supported by sea power.  If a         Zeppelin base were established  there;  it  could not  be used for       - . attacks on any other -power.   The1  wireless station,  even if  .... -under  der man  control in  peace,... can be  of  little danger in. war         unless the sovereignty of  the  Island were vested in Germany.         On the existing basis, or  on any  basis which (so far as  is         known  to the  Admiralty)  is contemplated as possible,  such a         Station would be controlled and either closed or censored by         another Power in time of war.            4.-  ?;ith  every desire  to be alive  to  the possibility         of future developments which cannot be exactly foreseen.         the Admiralty think that this  question is little else than     o:vy  a 1 mare1 s nest1.:                                   Yours sincerely,(Signed)   J.  R.  JBLLICOE.
