                                Intelligence Bureau,                                    Department of Information.                                         &apos; BWA/OIO.  ;                 Weekly Report on Austria.  X.                        (21st July,  1917.)     There is no further development in the politioal situationeither in Austria or in Hungary.   The Reichsrat, after passinga four months&apos; Budget and a bill  extending its mandate till theolose of 1918,was adjourned indefinitely on the 16th  July.    Theidea of convoking the Delegations appears now to have been  definite-ly dropped, with the result that  Count Czernin escapes the  dangerof a debate on foreign policy.   All hope of forming  a parliamentaryCabinet in Austria has been postponed till the autumn, despitethe very obvious objections to fresh delays, and despite the strongdisapproval shown by public opinion  through the Press.   ThusHitter von 8eidler and his Cabinet of officials are to remain inoffice.   This is above all due to the deadlock which resultedfrom, the refusal of the Czechs to support  any government whichdoeB not break with the Dual System, and the consequent impossibilityof inducing the block of Slav parties to accept office for  any  ofits members.:     Proposals for Constitutional Reform.   During the week  pre-ceding the adj ournment there had  been much discussion of a  newproposal for constitutional reform in Austria submitted by  Rittervon Soldier for the consideration of the various parties, and verywidely ascribed to tho initiative of Professor Rc;31ioh,thoughhe himself disclaims all responsibility for it.   According to  thisscheme, which bears a suspicious  likeness  to the Irish Convention,a committee of 25 members was to  have boon appointed  - ten  fromthe Lower and five from the Upper House, and the remaining  tennominated from the outside.   Their  duty would have been to draftSECRET.
a new constitution!  on the lines of that racial equality whichis guaranteed by the fundamental law of 1367 but which has onlybeen partially and imperfectly applied in practice.    Here againthe opposition of the Czechs proved fatal, and nothing is likelyto come of the project.   One further attempt to promote anunderstanding between Germans and Czechs appears to  have beenmade by the German-Bohemian members of the Upper House - doubtlessled by Dr. Baernreither,  who, had been appointed to the newly-createdMinistry of Public Health in the Clam-Mart in ic Cabinet;  but theattempt was of course foredoomed to failure -     Another recognised authority on racial and constitutionalproblems in Austria, the  Social Democrat deputy. Dr.  Hennery  .hasmeanwhile put forward, the proposal that &quot;National Chambers&quot; shouldbe formed for each of the eight Austrian nations, eaoh with aSecretary of State of its own.   The details are not  as yet avail-able, but it may be inferred from his previous writings that theseChambers would be intended to supersede the existing  system ofseventeen local Diets.   This scheme also has little  chance ofsuocess.   That it does not go anything like far enough for anyof the 81avs is best illustrated by the attitude of  the CzechSocial Democrat delegation to Stockholm,  which demands the con-version of Austria-Hungary into a  federation of independentStates organised on a racial basis and treats the Czechs andSlovaks together as one of these untts.     The Amnesty, has come into operation and all the imprisoneddeputies, including Dr. Kramarz, are now at large.    The leadingGerman paper in Prague estimates the number of political offendersnow released from internment at no fewer than 18,000J    It maybe noted however that two of the released Czeoh deputies have  atonce been ordered to join up, and it may be intended  to  get ridof inconvenient politiciane  in this less drastic, but no lesseffect iv*j manner.   This  appears to be the reason Why two such
1r*ll*iaiown Southern Slav deputies as Dr. Smodlaka of Spalato andDr. Cingrija of Ragusa, hare not &quot;been heard of during the sitting- of parliament.     Rival Constitutional Views in Austria and Hungary.,   Thepronouncement of the Austrian Premier during the debatepeace interpellation of the Polish Socialist, M. DaszynsJci, hasraised very important internal and foreign issuesi   Hitter vonSeidfcer had in his speech characterised the assumption that theAuetro-Hungarian government aocepted self-determination as the basisfor a peace, as erroneous.   He emphasised both in his own nameand in that of the Joint Foreign Minister the Crown1s exclusiveconstitutional right to decide matters of war and peace.   Thisstatement, following on the formal demand for Czecho-Slovak unityput forward by the Czech Parliamentary Club, gave rise to a veryremarkable demonstration in the Hungarian Parliament-   On the 4thJuly the late Premier, Count Tisza - obviously by arrangement vaddressed an interpellation to the government, in which, whileexpressly refraining from any oommentary on the rights assuredto the frown under the Austrian constitution, he pointed out thatthe idea of any such reserved rights is diametrically opposed toHungarian constitutional theory.   (in all this it is essential tobear in mind the fact that in Austria-Hungary there are threeentirely distinct governments, the Joint Austro-Eungarian, responsibleto the Delegations, and the Austrian and Hungarian, responsiblerespectively to the Parliaments of Vienna and Budapest, j   Politelybut firmly Count Tisza reminded the Austrian Premier that in mattersof war and peace - whatever might be the powers of the Ikuperor ofAustria - the Hungarian government did not recognise such powersin the case of the King of Hungary and claimed as much a rightto decide as the Joint Government.   He went on to deal in con-siderablc detail with an official explanatory article published inthe Vienna Fremdenblatt f?ith the purpose ofcorrecting mistaken
interpretations of Herr  von  Seidler&apos;o speech.    Referring to apassage in this article,  which treats President  Wilson*s idea ofgeneral democratisation  through internal reforms in the variousStates as &quot;sympathetic and thoroughly justified&quot;/Count Tisza tookstrong except ion to the  phrase &quot;within the framework of the Stateas a whole&quot; (Gesamtstaat).   Such an expression, he argued, couldonly refer to  the Austrian Empire, hut not in  any way to theKingd om of Hungary, which would kn ow how t o meet any tendenc ieson the part of Austrian  policy to interfere with vital interestsor rights of the Hungarian State.   In hie reply to Count Tisza,the Premier, Count Ester hazy, was still more explicit and affirmedthat the expression &quot;Gesamtstaat&quot; cannot possibly refer to Austria-Hungary /which according to  the laws of 1723,  1790 and 1867 isnot a Joint State at  all, but a union of two States of equal rank.     During the same debate  Counts Tisza and Esterhazy were no lessexplicit regarding the question of the nationalities, which, theyargued, could under no circumstances be regarded as a joint affair.Hence the Hungarian government absolutely repudiates the Ententeinterpretation of &quot;Self-determination&quot; in favour of any of theHungarian nationalities.     A few days later an article appeared in the Neue Preie Presseby Count Julius Andrassy who, though not an actual member of thenew Hungarian Cabinet, is the acknowledged head  of the party towhich the Premier, Count listerhasy,.  belongs.   In it he deals withvarious historical precedents, anci especially  the occasion on whichhis own father, the elder Andrassy,  as Hungarian Premier in 1871,intervened in the interest  of the Magyars to  prevent CountHohenwarfs plan for transforming Austria into a federal State.He expressed the conviction  that the federal idea would rouse moreenergetic opposition in  Hungary than ever before, and would createan impossible situation.   &quot;If the Hungarian nation were to seethat a desire to grant to the Bohemian Kingdom - split as it is
- 5 - int o two host i le camp s - or to a S out hern S lav State c omoo sed out of various parts, the same rights which Hungary-possesses, without regard to her historic rights and the numerous sacrifices which she has made to maintain them, then Hungary would become an enemy of this whole development.   Only in one oase could Hungary come to terms with such an idea - if the parity between the two States and the Dual System were to be replaced by a Personal Union&quot;!(i.e. the mere link of the Sovereign, as e.g* in the case of medieval Poland and Hungary).   Thie attitude on the part of Hungary&apos;s leading statesmen and constitutional authorities shows the extraordinary and almost insuperable difficulties which con- front the advocates of federalism.     Count Karolyi and Peace.   Considerable sensation has been caused in Hungary by a speech delivered at a provincial town by Count Michael Karolyi, urging peace ,on the basis of &quot;no annexations&quot; and criticising Germany&apos;s readiness to continue thenrar.   The importance of this has been exaggerated abroad, owing to the false assumption that because Karolyi supports the government what he said represents the government1 s views.   Magyar Hirlap, the organ of Andrasey and therefore of the Premier, makes it abundantly clear that Esterhazy * s foreign polioy is identieal with Count CzerninVs, and Count CzerninVs in turn with Count Tisza!s, and that all three stand irrevocably committed to the German alliance. Karolyi!s support of the government is due to its attitude on the franchise question, not to its foreign policy.   Count Batthyahy, Karolyi1s party li out onant, as Mini st cr a latere also accepts the Czejnin pel icy, and it has been made quite clear that Karolyi in his speeches merely represents his own private opinion.     Apart from this divergence of view in the Karolyi group considerable friction appears to have been caused inside the new Hungarian Cabinet between the followers of Andrassy and Appcnyi, owint to the defeat of the government candidate for the Presidency
 of the Chamber by Mr. Szasz, a member of the Tisza party.   There are numerous minor signs of internal weakness in the Hungarian Cabinet.     Great prominence has been given both in Austria and in Hungary to the confident announcement made by Marshal Hindenburg during his recent visit to Vienna - to the effect that the submarine problem will very shhrtly force England to her knees and that a victorious issue to the war may be expected ere: very long.   Typical of the reception of this are the columns of invective published by the Reighspost against &quot;England, incorporation and true1 source of mammonism and pseudo-democracy&quot;.   Under large head-lines, &quot;Approaching Decision through the U Boats&quot; and &quot;The Hour of Nerves&quot;, scorn is poured upon the rumour that in a secret session of the German Reichstag the submarine campaign has been described as disappointing.     It would as yet be premature to attempt any estimate of the reception of Herr von Bethmann Rollweg^s fall in Austria-Hungary. It is evident that that event is intimately bound up with the attitude of Austria-Hungary to tho whole question of war-aims,but the truth as to the real relations of the Vienna and Berlin governments is of course most jealously guarded,  and until theAustrian and Hungarian newspapers arrive it is impossible even  tobegin to estimate opinion.R.Y/.S.V/.
