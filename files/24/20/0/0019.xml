 TO.IFI0ATIOH Off FOOD CQTOOL.Memorandum by the Food Controller.       I desire  to dray; the  attention of my colleagues to theparamount necessity of unifying and  centralizing,  Under theMinistry of Food,  all  Departments  engaged in the purchase of food-stuffs or otherwise dealing  with food questions.  At present thereare at least four  bodies wholly or partially independent of theMinistry engagea in this work;-           1, The Royal Commission  on Wheat Supplies, which              purchases not only  wheat, but also  maize, rice,  barley              and oatmeal.           2. $he itoyal Commission  on the Sugar Supply.           3. The Board of  Trade, engaged in the  purchase of              moat and of cheese.           4. The T7ar Office (Army  Contracts Department)       The Oils  and Fats Branch of the Ministry of Munitions, whichdoalt with margarine.,  vras another  instance of independent action onfood-stuffs, but has now been transferred to this  Ministry.       The Army  and Havy Canteen Board also makes  independent pur-chases abroad, and purchases are,  from time to time, made on behalfof the Restriction of  Enemy  Supplies Department and the Foreign Office,in order to prevent supplies going to the enemy.       It seems  to me  clear  that if  the control of food supplies is tobo effected, all purchasing  bodies must be under the direction  of thoKinistry of Food,   The Royal Commissionson V/Leat \Supplies and on theSugar Supply, even if  they remain  as Royal Commissions, 53hould-.be re-garded as deparcmcnts  of the Ministry and the chairman of each  Gom-mission should be  an official of the Ministry          3...........SECRET.6. T.  1419.
       The Branch of the Board of Trade dealing with the purchasingof Meat and of Cheese should he taken o\sr and beoome a depart-meat of the Ministry of rood.   At present the Food Controllerhas no authority owr awino responsibility for the arrangementsmade in respect to the purchase and distribution of Foreign Meatnor for any arrangements carried through for the purchase of cheese.       Finally, in respect to the far Office, I suggest that pur-chasee made for the Army must be merged with those made for Civiliansif undesirable competition is not to continue and bargains to bemade which are unfair to the one side or to the other.   There canbe little doubt, for example, that the arrangement made between theWar Office, and the Board of Trade, in regard to the price offoreign meat, however advantageous to the far Office raised theprice to the civilian consumer.   The scale of War Office purchaseshas made it impossible for them not to affect the market foraxxia civilian supplies even in the past, when (apart from oereals)there has been no systematic policy of purchase on behalf ofcivilians.   Now that a general policy of purchasing supplies bythe Ministry of Food is proposed, it is essential that the controlof all the prinoipal food stuffs, both for civilian  and for mili-tary purposes be centralised.       This centralisation should apply also te the work of the Attayand Navy Canteen Board.       When the organisation of food control in the tJnited Statesis completed, the unification of such control in this country willbe pressing.   The Food Controller in the States should have tocorrespond with one Food Controller in this country and one only.                      (Sgd)    RKOUDDA,18th July 1917,
