CLC ONFIBEHTIAL,LilillSTEY OF PENSIONS.period from 14th July to 20th July 1917.Pensions.J 0 0          The number of pensions granted during the week toofficers and.men, and to widows, children and dependants(Table 15 was 9,803 against 12,400 last week and 11,457 theweek before. . Since the beginning of the war 732,012 pensions,including children1^ allowances have been awarded.          Table II shows that last week 35 grants of.supplementary pensions and special allo?mnces were made bythe Statutory Committee against 42 in the previous week.The total number to date is 4148.2.        The number of fresh claims to pension of disabledsoldiers dealt with by the Awards to Soldiers Branch duringthe week ending 18th July was 3600 as compared with 4500 duringthe previous week.  The drop in the number of awards made wasdue to much of the time of the more experienced Award Officersbeing occupied in the instruction of the newer members of theAwards Staff.  lYhen the latter Officers have gained thenecessary experience an appreciable increase in the numberof awards made should result.          Of the 3600 cases 2325 were disposed of by theaward of pension, permanent or temporary, 1260 by the grantof gratuities, and in 15 cases the claims were rejected.Claims which had previously been rejected under formerWarrants were admitted in 431 cases, 382 of the men beinggranted gratuities and 49 pensions.  The total number ofclaims previously rejected which have been dealt with up todate is 4926 of which 825 have been met by the award ofpension and 4101 by gratuities.
3,        The Special Tribunal appointed to hear appeals.from men who have been awarded gratuities in place ofpensions on the ground that the   unfitness for which theywere, discharged was neither attributable to nor aggravatedby their service, met on the 14th and 20th July to considerprocedure.  They asked for definition of their powers andwide advertisement of their functions, and they determinedto see personally all appellants and to give them widefacilities for putting their cases forward as completely aspossible without it involving them in expense.  At the sametime the Tribunal recognised that its  procedure-  should besuch as to trammel the Ministry as little as possible intheir duties connected with the award of pensions.4.        The work of awarding and authorising payment ofWidows and Dependants pensions in current cases is completelyup to date.          3,152 re-assessments  of  dependants pensions weremade during the week against 3,186 last week and 5,091 theweek before.   There remain 39,540 cases to be dealt with(Appendix I).  Tne 3,152 cases this week include 952dependants pensioned under the old Warrant who have benefittedby the re-assessment to the average extent of 4/2 a week,and 575 dependant parents whose cases had been settled by agratuity under the old &quot;&quot;arrant but have now been placedon pension at an average rate of 6/l0d a week.  The rest ofthe 3,152 receive no benefit, their pensions already beingequal to pre-war dependance.          As a result of the week1s re-examinations as toentitlement under the new Warrant,7 widows not previouslyhelped have been admitted to fujl pension, and 2 totemporary pension.  276 (widows and dependants)  remain tobe dealt with out of the original total of 4,523,
            On the 16th July the  Treasury approved the.V payment of a gratuity of   5 to  all  soldiers&apos;-and...sailors1  wido w s who s e husbands1 - de a ths had been not if ied since  the  1st July 1916,  and will be notified in future,   previous  to the 1st July 1916, a  5 grant had been given practically  in all cases by the Royal Patriotic Corporation Fund,   From  the 1st July 1916,  to the 3rd April 1917, a  grant not  exceeding  3 vras made under 15  (c)  of the Statutory  ..  Committee!s Regulations to meet urgent necessary expenses  consequent on or caused by the  soldierls death  which could  not bemet out of the ordinary income of the widow.   Since  the 4th April a  3  grant  has been made in all cases under  Article 14 (1)  of the Royal &quot;arrant of 29th March.   The  new grant will  be in addition to any sums paid  under the  Statutory Committee&apos;s Regulations.   The  3 paid under  the  Royal Warrant will  be deducted  from the  5 now  to be  issued under Treasury authority.  6.         The draft Army  Offleers&apos;Warrant has  evoked  little criticism and no great interest.  There  has  been no  demand for a discussion of it in either House of Parliament.  The &quot;Horning Post&quot;  considers that it fails to meet  the  requirements of the case.    Ho!  hostile remarks  have been  observed in other newspapers.   The  Admiralty have expressed  their concurrence,  with a few minor exceptions  in the  draft &quot;arrant for Ilavy  Of fie rs,  7.                Treatment.            The seventeenth meeting of the Committee  on  Institutional Treatment in England  and V/ales was held on  the 19th instant.    Their rep rt is annexed as  Appendix II hereto  and summarized  as follows:- .       (1)  Neurasthenics.   At Golders Green there are 76  patients and 176 awaiting admission and steps are being taken  to  increase accommodation.   Some difficulty is experienced  in getting doctors8   The intensive cultivation work is about  to  be started.    Other  accommodation in the neighbourhood of  . - ...  London is still being sought.            At Leeds  a good house with accomodatioh for 100                                 .A           beds

(2) Tuberculosis.  11 beds out of 32 provided for advancedeases in London Hospitals are occupied.   The sum of  3,000 iftbeing offered to the Tuberculosis colony at Popworth in Cambridge-shire for a lieu on 30 beds for either advanced or colony cases,8.        A preliminary meeting of a Committee on InstitutionalTreatment in Scotland as reconstituted to be representative^ ofeill the larger interests concerned in the treatment and trainingof disabled men in Scotland was held in Edinburgh under theChairmanship of Sir A.G. Boscawen on the 14th instant,   Theirreport is annexed as Appendix III heretot from which it will beseen that they discussed the provision of a neurasthenicinstitution, an epileptic colony at Dudhope House near Dundee,an orthopaedic annexe to the First Scottish General Hospital atAberdeen, treatment for rheumatism at Strathpeffer and Moffafcand the sufficiency of the existing provision for advanced casesof tuberculosist9.        Under the new arrangements made with the Beard of Controland referred to in Paragraph 7 of the last week1s report, dischargedmen when once admitted to Lunatic Asylums will in most cases betreated as Service Patients, and will thus be a charge on theMinistry and not on the Poor Law Authorities.   The actual mode ofadmission to the asylums is, however, understood in som$ caeqs toinvolve the use of the poor law machinery, and strong complainton this point has been made to the Minister by the Board and alsofrom the Lancashire Joint Committee.   Representations haveaccordingly been made to the War Office and Admiralty with a viewto instructions being givbn to the Military Hospitals which willr                                                          secure
secure that the man discharged to an asylum is in all c as es s entunder military escort direct to the Institution and that the agencyof the poor law authorities is avoided.10.       A conference on the subject of the best way of dealing withdeaf disabled soldiers in London with regard to the assessment oftheir pension and their subsequent treatment and training was heldon the 17th instant with the following leading aurists     Mr. Arthur Cheatle, Aural Surgeon to King&apos;s College Hospital.     Mr. Sidney Scott, Aural Surgeon to St. Bartholomew&apos;s Hospital.  :   Mr. Hunter Tod, Aural Surgeon to Guy1s Hospital.     Mr. George Clark Cathcart ; Surgeon to the Throat Hospital,                                            :Golden Square.and  Major Dundas Grant.          The Conference were generally of opinion that Mr.Cathcart, who at present reports on aural cases for the LondonInvaliding and Examining Board, should be given additional specialistassistance and should recommend for all cases and not only forthe very deaf ones the subsequent treatment and training necessary,that the Government should take proper measures to secure that thetreatment and training recommended are given, that the treatmentshould be in-patient treatment where operations are necessary, andotherwise out-patient treatment at special clinics at Londonhospitals.   The Conference did not think that a permanent boardof the specialists then assembled to deal with all cases of seriousdeafness after they had been picked out by an invaliding Board, wasnecessary.11.       The Leicester Local Committee have submitted for approvala comprehensive scheme for the treatment.of all classes of caseylikely to come before their Committee, for which provision can bemade either within the County or elsewhere.          A scheme has been submitted&apos; by the Surrey Local Committeebut the detailed arrangements proposed are not fully complete, anda conference will be held with the Commlttee in order to securetho necessary improvements.                                                             V/here
          Where general arrangements have been sanctioned formedical - treatment, individual cases have not up to the presentbeen notified.   &quot;Shder the new arrangements made by the Ministrynotification will be secured in future.         v           Training,12,       Approval has been given to a further scheme submittedby the Portsmouth Local Committee for training men in Acetylene-Yf elding,  Motor Mechanics and Electrical work (inclidlng Liftmen,Switchboard operators, Cinema operators, electric wiring andgeneral maintenance of plant) at the Technical Institute.        The Surrey Local Committee submitted a comprehensivescheme in which it was proposed to utilise all the TechnicalInstitutes in their county which had been approached through theLocal Education Committees.   Representatives of the Committeewere invited to a conference at the Ministry ?/ith a vie?/ to aconcentratixm of training in particular subjects at the mostappropriate centres.        Complaints having arisen as to the nature of the trainingin Motor  driving at the Battersea Polytechnic for disabled men,Major Mitchell v/as commissioned to make a special investigationand the course will be improved in accordance with his report.          It has become apparent from correspondence with theLocal Committees that they appreciate the importance of consultingJoint Disablement Committees on the question of the most suitablelocalisation of industrial training for their areas.          .                 .      ...          ,  , .      jit Munitions   .          A conference was held with representatives of the Minis-cry/with a view to avoiding overlapping in the training arrangementsof the two Ministries.   It was agreed that ordinarily thetraining  required for Munitions work ( which it is understoodoccupies  from six weeks to three months) was not of a characterwhich would secure any prospect of permanent employment to the man,and in these circumstances the cost of training and the allowancesduring training to the man would mare properly fall on theMinistry of Munitions than the Ministry of Pensions0                                                            Sanction
          Sanction has been given to the training -of individualmen in 33 cases and in 65 others-further&quot; enquiries  were directed.          When general, -arrangements have been sanctioned forcourses of training^ individual cases trained under  it have nothitherto been notified.   Under new arrangements that havebeen made they will be notified in futuro.13.       On the 14th and 15th instant^ Major Mitchell, Adviserto the Ministry on Training, visited Brighton to enquire intothe need for enlarging the workshops there, where men awaitingadmission to limbless hospitals are put through courses oftraining for which they volunteer.   He came to the conclusionthat the present accommodation for 90 to 95 in the  workshops lefta good margin of increase over the present average  attendanceof 75 pupils.   In view of the fact that 20% of the patients werebed cases and 40$ were returning to their old occupations theaverage attendance of 75 was considered satisfactory.14.       On the 16th and 17th Instant  Major Mitchell madearrangements for the instruction at the technical college inBrighton of some 20 disabled men in diamond cutting, the bulk ofthe expenditure involved by the training and the subsequentemployment of the men being guaranteed by an importer of diamondswho has combined with a number of Belgian Diamond Merchants toestablish the Diamond cutting industry nn this country.15.       Appendix IV hereto is a report of a meeting of thePermanent Committee of the Inter-Allied conference  on disabled anddischarged men which was held in Paris fcn the 11th July, GreatBritain being represented by Lieut, Col, Stanton, Secretary to theStatutory Committee and Sir Charles wicholson, Bart., M.P.,Chairman of the Disablements Sub-Committee of the London UarPensions Committee.   The meeting was an outcome of the largerConference which took place in May and the Permanent Allied Committeare intended to keep up a permanent interest in the objects ofthat conference and to collect and diffuse information.

A statement of the proceedings of the Statutory     ^Committee for the week ended July 18th, 1917, is annexed (App*endix V).   The meat notable feature in the Inspectors1Reports is the statement from Birmingham that tho number ofdischarged disabled soldiers applying for treatment andtraining is rapidly increasing.   Some unfavourable reportshave been received fcn&amp;he working of Local Committees in theMidlands, especially from Derby town and Stoke-on-Trent.Wolverhampton dpes not look after its disabled men well;Walsall is improving.   Satisfactory reports have been receivedfrom Dudley, and Bedford, from Glamorgan County, and Pontyprtdd,the latter being described as one of the few bright spots inSouth Wales.   Efforts at improvement are feeing made, inCounty Meath; the results in Tipperary North Riding aremeagre.17.       The Naval and Military War Pensions etc., (Transferof Powers) Bill passed through Committee and was read a thirdtime and passed in the House of Commons on the 17th instant.The amendments with the objects referred to in paragraph 15of last week*s report and paragraph 17 of the previous week*sreport were moved by the Minister after Mr* ^ogge tiad protestedagainst half instead of the whole of the million tnst Parliamenthad granted to the Statutory Committee, being made over tothe Ministry of Pensions for the purpose of tho specialGrants Committee.   Mr. Pennefather and Mr. Allen supportedMr. Hogge as to this.   Sir Henry Craik and Mr. LawrenceHardy took the other side and Sir Arthur Boscawen explainedhow the bulk of the Statutory Committee^ former work wouldin future be done by the Ministry out of annually voted funds t                                                     leaving
 leaving only the comparatively small, number of discretionary cases to be financed from what will be the Special Grants Accounts jbe point of the half million was.not pressed, no other was raised in opposition, and the Minister was thanked by Mr, Hogge for the way inw whichthe suggestions made by him ana others had been met, A copy of the Bill as sent up to the House of Lords is annexed as Appendix VI. 10,       A circular (No, 7) has been issued to Local Committees, (Appendix VII) instructing them as to the preparatioWuad submission - to their County Borough Committees, of estimates of their expenses of administration for the current year, 19,                 - Staff etc,  -          Table III shews an addition of 57 to the staff of the Ministry during the week, 29 having been added to the Awards to Soldiers Branch at Chelsea and 23 to the Pensions Issue Office. The staff now comprises 167 men, and 3,294 women, or 3,461 in all. The Statutory Committee employ 109 men and 180 women, or 289 in all,bringing up the grand total to 3,750,          The dally percentage of absences during the week was2 *4 among the male and 3 *3 among the female staff.20.       The future efficiency of the Ministry is again beingthreatened by restrictions of space for the staff *   The 1org delayin completing the extension to the Crown Agent!s building,  which isurgently required for part of the Administrative Off ices of theMinistry and part of-the Statutory Committee will seriously hamper the                                &apos;  -               .  of thetaking over and the requisite extension of the work/ya.      Therapid increase in the number of renewals of pensions at Chelseaas always greater numbers come on to pension will require furtheraccommodation for at least 400 clerks by the end of this year and if,as is understood, lack of timber and labour make the erection oftemporary buildings impossible private houses, in the neighbourhoodof the Duke of Yorkfs headquarters, will have to be corcnandeered andadapted.  18th  July,  1917.

APPENDIX II.           C0J.1IITTJ S GIT INSTITUTIONAL TR^VTliiaiT&apos;          The nineteenth meeting of the Committee was held onThursday .the 19th July, at Westminster&apos; House, Millbank. Present *          Sir Arthur Boscawen, the Hon.  Arthur Stanley, Sir          7/alter Lawrence and Mr. Cyril Jackson with Sir John          Collie, Sir H. Haward, Dr. H.S. Hartley and Dr. C*          Hubert Bond. The minutes of the last meeting were taken as read and passed. Neurasthenics.  Sir John Collie reported that with regard to the establishment of an Institutional at Leeds he had seen the property of the late Lord Allerton which was under consideration. It could provide accommodation for one hundred beds and had sufficient grounds.   Electric light was installed and everything in connection with the place was in order.   He preferred this place to Sir John Barrans home which was smaller. The building would not require any alterations of great moment. A letter was read from the Solicitors of the estate of the late Lord Allerton enquiring as to the proposed tenure and the necessary covenants&apos; as to up-keep and maintenance of the grounds.          After a general discussion Sir John Collie recommended that the offer of the premises should be accepted, and it ?/as resolved that the Red Cross Society should take a lease in their name and be given the usual indemnity by the Committee.          The papers were handed to Mr. A. Stanley for reference to the Solicitor of the Red Cross Society, Leeds Infirmary.  A letter dated 14th July from the Leeds Infirmary was read; asking for information and stating certain terms.   Sir John Collie said he had interviewed the Comrffi-ttee at.Leeds.  : They stated that they were accommodating&quot;between two and three hundred soldiers and vfere losing 4/-. per man per week on their keep,                                                         and
and consequently would not undertake  any furtherresponsibility with soldiers  until they knew  exactly whattheir position was going to;be.    A general discussion tookplace as to expenses and the  position with regard to the  .letter.   Sir Arthur Boscawen undertook to see  Sir M* Nathanand discuss the letter with him.          Sir John Collie said he regarded it as  importantthat the Leeds people should  manage the proposed  Institution.Leicester *  Sir John Collie reported  that he  had  found asuitable House at Leicester which was big enough  to accommodateone hundred beds.   The Leicester people would  furnish thehouse and give it free of rent.   Y/ith regard to  the managementthere was a fund of  60,000 raised in Leicester and the Mayor:of Leicester was anxious that any Institution on  which partof this fund was expended should be partly controlled by membersof the fund Committee.   He thought a Committee of six wouldbe sufficient consisting of two Doctors from the  Infirmary  andsome of the fund Committee.          Sir H. Haward suggested that there  should be a  detailedestimate of the cost of management, and Sir  John  Collie agreedto draw up a detailed list of the cost of management at GoldersGreen and furnish same.:          It was resolved to  ask the  Leicester  people for adetailed statement of their  estimate  of the  cost  of running theproposed Institution on the  lines, particulars  of which were tobe forwarded.    Sir John Collie undertook to arrange this  andfurnish&quot; Sir II. Haward with a  copy of  particulars.          Mr. Stanley put it  that with regard to  Leeds the  RedCross would find the money for the establishment  charges &amp;c. andwith regard to Leicester the  Leicester People, would do so.Kent House, Ealing.          Sir John Collie reported that he had  visited thisproperty in company with the  Red Cross Surveyor.    It would be                                                       too
too expensive to alter it to meet their requirements and wouldcost &quot;between two and three thousand pounds.   He consideredit would-be far better to enlarge Golders Green.          Hr. Stanley produced particulars of three Houseswhich&apos;had been sent in in reply to the Red Cross Society1 sadvertisement.   Sir John Collie undertook to Inspect themand report to the Committee at a later meeting!Mr. Leigh* s house *  Sir Arthur Boscawen stated that Mr. Leighwas coming to London to interview him on either Monday orTuesday of next week with reference to his house.   ivir. Jacksonreferred to Osterly  Park as a possible position, but heunderstood that at the present time there was a mechanicaltransport section quartered In the grounds.Leopardstown.  The offer of this estate which is near Dublinwas presented to the meeting together with the correspondence,a report and a minute by Sir Matthew Nathan.   It was considerethat there ?/ere not enough Neurasthenic Officers in Irelandto fill an Institution of this description.   The papers werehanded to Sir John Collie to deal with and report to theCommittee.           Sir Arthur Boscawen said that with regard to-Scotland the Committee for Scotland anticipated obtaining asuitable place, but he fore saw difficulties in the obtainingof resident Medical Officers for this class of Institution./Heswell, Cheshire . :  .          The correspondence in connection with thisInstitution was read.   Sir John Collie pointed out that froma.Medical standpoint the place could not be a success as itwas too small.   He did not consider that any institution ofthis nature could be satisfactory, which did not have a residentMedical Officer.   He had pointed this out to the Committee atHeswell and said that to render it useful the place should be
enlarged.   His opinion was that it Has essential that ahome for Neurasthenics&apos;should have a resident Doctort   Onemodical officer could look after 50 patients. - - It wasrecommended that a letter he written to the He swell Committeethat unless the Institution way enlarged to take 50 cases anda Resident Ledical Officer appointed this Committee could notrecognise it.Polders Green.          Sir John Collie said that the question of medicalmen for new Institutions was one that needed consideration.Two young Irish Doctors had been recommended to him and hehad asked them to come over.   He desired the Committeespermission to keep them a fortnight as he proposed they shouldvisit Golders Green every day during that time.   He foresawdifficulties in. obtaining Doctors in the future and:hoped bythis method to overcome it. and at the same time afford them thenecessary experience.  The Committee agreed to the proposedarrangement.: At the present time there were 76 patients inGolders Ore en and 176 awaiting ,admission.Intensive Culture.  He had arranged for Major ?razer!s plantto be brought up in a few days.   He suggested that a hutshould be built outside Golders Green to accommodate tho Nurses  :and servants, this would allow another 50 beds to be providedfor patients.,   Mr. Stanley put it that it would be quickerif some houses in the near neighbourhood could be secured for &apos;-&apos;the Nurses nnd servants.   Sir John Collie agreed and promisedto make enquiries and report.&quot;;itham Camp.  Sir John Collie reported that he had visited       y-&quot;itham Camp on Sunday.   Thwe were 30 beds there.   Dr.Goding was in charge.   ?our hundred men who have passed outhad been circularised.   He; regarded assistance with regardto after treatment as being very important, and was hopefulthat, it might be enlarged.   There was a class of work on        j /                                  &apos;    -                  the      i;: \
the &amp;arms at Wit ham. in connection &quot;with, the jfilling inof trenches and restoring the surface of the landdisturbed by the Military Authorities which his men ecu Iddo satisfactorily.   All these men would be regarded asbeing under training.          With regard to the necessary staff he supervisedthem and they were under him.   It was decided that thequestion of Staff  was not one for this Committee, andthat Sir John Collie should see Sir Matthew Nathan onthe ma.tter.Tuberculosisi          Dr. H.S. Hartley reported that out of the 32Institutional beds at their disposal  11 were -occupied.It was decided at a meeting on Tuesday that Mrs. Woodwould arrange that Miss Cotton Stapleton of the LadyAlmoners Department Brompton.would visit various Medicalmen and Institutions with a view to establishing the factthat Institutional beds were available.   At Dr. Hartleysrequest it was decided to request the Chelsea authoritiesto send their notification of cases direct to him.Standard Pavilions:  Dr* Hartley reported that the LocalGovernment Board would not take action until the OfficialInstructions which were to be issued were out.  It wasexplained that the Instructions referred to were now out.          He said that a definition of advancedecases hadbeen settled.   The Surveyor to the Red Cross would nowpass all payments, and he was going through the plans withhim.   It was resolved that gir. Walter Lawrence, Mr /Stanleyand Dr, Hartley should finally approve and pass the plans.Chesterfield.  Sir Arunur Boscawen spoke of a Sanatoriumnear Chesterfield and ^r. Hartley undertook to look intothe Scheme and report to the Committee.Papworth.          Letter dated 17^h July from Mrs. Dims dale v/as                                                    read

 Circular No. 7.                                  -     /   MINISTRY OF  PENSIONS,                  .  &quot;    ,                                SECRETARY^ OFFICE,    ::V-                                  WESTMINSTER HOUSE,         .        .       :           ;&apos;:.   .-     MlLLBANK, .           .     -                    -.&apos;&quot;  v.: 77               ,   LONDON, S.W.1.    :     ....                          .           July,  1911- Sir,                       x   &apos;      7^7 v 7    :77-:7v7;  77;:&quot;            I am directed by  the Minister of Pensions  to draw  attention to- the provisions  of the Naval  and/Military War  Pensions V (Administrative) - Expenses Act, 1917, of  which a copy is enclosed&quot;.      . - --                    ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.        1.  Section 1 of  that Act provides that the administrative&apos; expenses - of a Local Committee are to  be defrayed by the. Council of the County or Borough or Urban District for whose area the Local Committee is established. ana the administrative expenses  of  a Local  Committee include  those  of  all District Committees or Sub-Committees within  its area.  The administrative expenses of the Local Committee must, however, be provided for  by  estimates-&apos; to be submitted from time to time by the Committee to  the Council for their; approval and by the Council in turn to the Local Government Board.  In the case of Scotland the Secretary for Scotland is the authority to whom  estimates- of  administrative  expenses are  to be  submitted for  approval.  If  the estimates are approved as reasonable by the  Board, the Council will become liable to meet the expenses within the  limits of their estimates,  but will be- able to claim repayment of two-thirds  of the  amount from the  Ministry of-Pensions.              .        2.  The  Local Committee&apos;s estimate of  their administrative  expenses must  be prepared and submitted to the Council at such times and for such period as  the Local Government Board require.   As will be seen  from the enclosed circular issued  by the Local Government Board, the first estimate of a  Local Committee in England and Wales is  required to cover the period from the date (17th May, 1917,) on which Royal Assent was given to the Act to the 31st March, 1918,  and is required to  be submitted to  the Council within one month from the date of the circular,  that is, by the 26th July in the present year.   Local Committees in Scotland  and Ireland are  required . to- submit their estimates at latest by  the end of the current month.  Since, however,  it is possible that the Local Committee may not be able accurately to estimate their administrative expenses for  a year,  in advance, the  Act. allows of  the submission of supplementary  estimates from-time to time as- necessity  arises, and it  will therefore be desirable that the Local Committee should in their first estimate provide only for the expenses  which they are quite satisfied will be incurred.         3; The  estimate will  have to  cover: the administrative  expenses of  District Committees or  Sub-Committees as well as those of  the  Local Com-  mittee, and while the Local Committee  will obtain from their Sub-Committees  (14370) 17772/34.  2,000.  7/17. M. &amp; 8.
-estimates of their own expenditure, it will be their duty to frame their ownestimate of what the expenses of their sub-areas should be.   In particularthev should consider whether a scale based either on the population of the.sub-area or district  or on the number  of cases assisted  in it  could not beadopted;  &apos; In this connection also the Local Committee should consider care-fully whether the existing sub-divisions of their area are the best adapted forthat purpose.     Too small sub-divisions,  for  example/involve merely anunnecessary  increase  of ; administrative  expenses without  adding to  theefficiency, of the work.                                           .       4. The  estimate to be submitted by the Local Committee must be inthe form prescribed by  the  Local Government Board, six copies  of whichare enclosed, though it may  be supplemented by further  detailed statementsif desired.  The form of estimate has been so  drawn as to show separately,as  regards the expenses of the staff and accommodation,  the extent to whichthe staff and accommodation  are engaged by the Local Committee or are lentby the Local Authority.   The Loan by the Local Authority of staff or officesis covered by the terms  of Section 6  of the Local Government (EmergencyProvisions Act),  1916, and  the  Minister recognises  that Local Authoritieshave  freely lent  the services of  officers or accommodation  to  Local  Com-mittees.   If in  any case  payment is proposed to be made for such services,the nature of the arrangement should be clearly stated in the  estimate sub-mitted to the Local Government Board.  The general principle governing anysuch arrangement should be as-stated in the circular of the Local GovernmentBoard, that:-                                               &apos;;          . &quot;No charge which is part  of the normal  expenditure of  the   &quot;Council   should  be   included   in  the  estimate,  but  only  the    - &apos;:&quot; amount  of the additional expenditure,  if any, incurred by the Council     &quot; by reason of  the assistance thus given to the Local Committee.&quot;    -.;.  5. In this connection I am to refer in particular to the arrangement bywhich the Clerk or Treasurer to the Council acts in an honorary capacity or-otherwise as Clerk or Treasurer to the Local Committee.  Such arrangementmay well be of great advantage to the Committee, but the Minister  considersthat in view of the large financial responsibility resting upon the Local Com-mittee it is desirable (provided it is clear that  the volume of work requiresthis)  that  the  Committee should  also  have  the whole-time  services ofat least one chief officer, who should be responsible for the administrativebusiness of the Local Committee, including  (in  the  case of a county) thefinancial transactions of the Sub-Committees or District Committees.      &apos;6- The  administrative expenses  of a Local Committee may  underSection 1 (4) of the Act  of 1917  include the travelling  expenses and  com-pensation for loss of remunerative time of Members of the Local Committeeor  of  any District Committee   or  Sub-Committee.  The  correspondingexpenses of Members of a Joint  Committee formed under Section  2 (8) ofthe Naval and Military War Pensions, &amp;c,  Act., 1915; will be deemed to beexpenses of Members of  the  Local Committee.   Copies of the Regulationswhich have been made for this purpose by the Minister, and  approved by:the Treasury, have been supplied to the Local&quot; Committee.  It will be seen
&quot;that as regards compensation for loss of remunerative time a member mustprove to the Committee that he has suffered an actual loss of earnings inconsequence of his attendance at the Meeting.   Thus, persons in receipt ofa  salary or  persons  not  engaged in employment  or business will not beentitled to claim compensation for loss of time under the Act.   It will furtherbe observed that claims for either travelling expenses or compensation forloss of time may only be sanctioned by the Local Committee, and consequentlysuch  claims when made by any member of a District Committee or Sub-Committee must be confirmed by the Local Committee.       7.  Administrative Expenses in general should  be kept within reason-able limits.   It  should  be remembered  that a  large part  of the work of aLocal  Committee, namely, the assessment and payment  of supplementaryreparation allowances and grants to the families and dependents of men whoare serving with the forces, will cease with the end of the war or demobilisa-tion.   The work of dealing with the health and training of disabled men andthe assessment of alternative pensions will indeed continue beyond this period,but the character of the organisation needed  for this work may  be foundto differ materially from that required under existing conditions.   In thesecircumstances contracts for the employment of officers or of office accommoda-tion (when  the latter cannot be lent by the Local Authority)  should alwaysbe made on a temporary basis.                     LOCAL VOLUNTAEY FUNDS.       S. Attention is  called to the terms of  Section 5 of the Act.  That:Section allows of the diversion of existing local voluntary funds which havebeen raised for providing assistance in some specific form  to disabled officersand men or to the wives and dependents of officers, to some other purpose,of a  like  kind,  if the Trustees or  Managers  of  the  Fund apply,  andthe  Minister  is  satisfied  that,  so   far  as  can  be   ascertained,  thesubscribers   desire  it.  Funds  are  believed  to   have   been  raised  inmany localities,   particularly in the  early  period  of  the war,  for thepurpose^of supplementing separation allowances or  pensions, but since suchsupplementation has been accepted by the State as a liability on public funds,the local funds in question have not been used.  The Minister believes thatin many cases trustees and  subscribers may  desire to see their local fundsapplied to  some other purpose more  suited  to present conditions,  andpossibly of more permanent benefit to the  soldiers and their dependents, and-Section 5 accordingly enables an order to be made by the Minister  legalisingsuch  application if it  is desired.                         I am, Sir,                                Your  obedient Servant,                                                            Secretary.THE SECRETARY  OR CLERK     TO THE LOCAL COMMITTEE.
