CONTROL OF  SUPPLIES AND PRICES.                .    ..     Expprt of  Foodstuffs from America--On July  10, Lord Rhondda  expressedto the Associated Press his opinion that &apos;the additional pressure- resulting from theEmbargo  Proclamation would tend to produce an earlier termination of the War, andwould, by diverting supplies from neutral&apos;destinations, help to solve the food problem     A (33)3143-2   Pk i  so  7/17 E&amp;S-                                          A
  of the Allied countries.   He added that, although, -the situation had been appreciably  eased by this embargo, no really effective measures could be taken for dealing with  the vital and pressing question of prices until the  American  Food Legislation had  been passed. .&quot;..&apos;                                                               -    &apos;  War Bread-On July 9, Mr. Alan  Anderson presided at a conference of Press  representatives held for the purpose of  considering suggestions to  the effect that the  mixture of flour should be standardised, and; that the use of substitutes in admixture  should  be prohibited or reduced.  It was pointed out that it was impossible to  prescribe a standard or uniform loaf, owing  to the wide variation in  milling  quality  of imported  wheats and the difficulty  of obtaining regular  distribution  throughout  the country of- the.:grains used. for. admixture.  It  was,  therefore,-  necessary, within  prescribed limits, that each  centre should use such grains as could most conveniently  be supplied.  As regards substitutes, the policy iof the Food Controller was expressed  to be  based on two  essential points :  (I) that an unrestricted  supply of bread must  be maintained at all. costs ; (2) that owing to scarcity of tonnage the available supply  of wheat  for feeding Europe is  reduced to,the nearest, available, sources and  is,  therefore,  definitely limited  in volume.   These two  conflicting points couLd only be  reconciled by the utmost  economy in the use of - wheat combined with the substitution  of other cereals to the utmost, extent compatible with the production of a wholesome  and palatable bread.. It was  added: that the difficulties involved  in. the necessary  process of adaptation were being overcome.      Meat Prices.-Lord Rhondda received, on July 9, a deputation from the Agricul-  tural  Association of England  and Wales, and on  July .10,  a deputation from  the  Scottish. Chamber, of Agriculture with  reference..to this subject.  It wras generally  admitted that the present price  of  cattle was excessive, but it was urged that Scotch.v  or English farmers who had recently bought cattle in the Irish market and had then  fattened such cattle  ought not to be specially taxed. by the fixing of. a .price for meat  which meant for. them an absolute  loss, .and  that the only: fair thing was that the  public-as a whole should bear the burden.    .-&apos;  .&apos;.&apos;-!   -Lord. Rhondda stated, in the House of Lords on July 11, thai-he proposed to fix  prices for meat  bought  both for Army and  civilian  consumption  on and after  September.!,  and that he hoped to  secure  a  substantial reduction in  the  price  of  cattle, and, consequently,  in the price of  meat.;  He added that  he hoped  to be able  to; stop: excessive prices all round.   : VV&apos;.: : a&apos;-&apos;;&apos;    7-&apos;i:::.c7l:       - v-      Sugar.--The Royal Commission on the  Sugar Supply have  announced in view of  repeated applications&apos;and complaints that all&apos; the sugar ear-marked for the purpose of : domestic preserving of fruit  has been either distributed or allotted andjthe voluntary  staff responsible for the&apos; distribution has been dispersed, so that it is impossible to  reopen the question  either generally or with reference to any. specific application.      No further losses through enemy action have  been reported during the week, but.  one marine loss of nearly 4,000 tons of. Java sugar has occurred through the foundering  of the  &quot; Onsang &quot; through&apos; stress of.weather.      This .is  the  first loss from  ordinary marine risks that  has  been suffered  by the  Commission since its establishment. ;       &quot;    :  The prospective position has, by means of further  purchases in Cuba  and the  allocation  of  tonnage for their  transport,  been very greatly  strengthened, and may  now - be regarded as  satisfactory unless losses in excess of 10 per cent, are incurred  on shipments arranged for the next three months, -    &apos; &apos; -&apos; -&apos; ;      : &apos;                              .:  FOOD ECONOMY,              ,  &apos;      Evidence accumulates  from  all parts  of  the  country, to. show  that the Food  Economy  Campaign has  had  a marked influence in lessening the - consumption of  bread.t  Many places in Yorkshire  show good  results::Diddington  being 3*9 lbs.  of  bread  per head  per week; Featherstone 4&apos; 26 lbs.;  Keighley 3&apos; 7 lbs.  The largest  supply firm in Barnsley sold 2,882 lbs. less of  bread in  the week ending June 9th  compared, with -the  corresponding week  in May, and  18,000 lbs. less compared with  the same week in.April./ In. York itself the &quot;consumption of: flour fell from 210. tons  in the week ending April 28th to 112;tons in  the week ending June..2nd.    -    v.------  j  i  There are no specific figures for  Lancashire, but reports from  different - centres  show,that a considerable reduction.has been effected....                        ;.;   -
&apos;.  -  It seems probable that bat for ttte energy.of the.Food Economy Campaign  therewould have been a  rise, in stead  of - a  fall,  in  the consumption of bread, especiallyduring the period when the potato shortage was acute.         - /  ;    Leaflets urging continued economy and the avoidance of all waste  are  still beingdistributed.&quot;-;-.  -   -&quot;&apos;1  .&apos; -  -   . .:.         &apos;           &quot; , &apos;     .              &apos;             &apos;: ENFORCEMENT&apos; OF ORDERS.                 .    Potatoes. Two  retailers were recently prosecuted for  selling potatoes at illegalprices.  As it appeared that they had been  compelled to: pay illegal prices to securepotatoes  their cases were adjourned for  the Spitalfields  wholesale  salesman to bosummoned.  The cases were then heard together and ;the  Spitalfields salesman was-fined  1001. and the retailers 51. each. -           -    Cereals.-Various  cases  of the waste  of bread have been reported by the ChiefConstables of Hants and Sheffield.  The  police had prosecuted in these. cases andadequate penalties were imposed on conviction.                    - -  &quot;     -    &apos;&apos;:    PuUic Meals  Order.-This  Ministryrecently addressed  the Westminster CityCouncil on the subject  of alleged contraventions of this Order in clubs and restaurantswdthin their  area, and  suggested an inspection of records.   Various prosecutions areresulting.  The first case was heard on the  10th July at. Bow Street, the defendantsbeing Simpson&apos;s Tavern,-Strand.  Simpson&apos;s had  consumed far more meat than waslawful.  A. conviction  was obtained,  fines  and costs amounting to  521. 10s.   Themanager of the  Norfolk Hotel,  Strand, was fined 151.  15s. for failing to keep  theprescribed register. : ;                                                         .

In the following paragraphs, a summary is. given  of the Food. Position  up to Wednesday,Tlth July, and of the changes which have occurred since the last Report of July 4th.  The chief features which call for attention are :          - -;     ; ;*:&apos;  1. The maintenance of a high rate of imports  in the case of wheat and wheaten       .  ,  flour.. : The  supplies of cheese, sugar,  bacon, and  oats also are consider-i           able.  On the other hand the imports of mutton, lard, and margarine           are lower than in the previous week.          -           .  -    ,    -  .   2..

It must, moreover, be, noticed, that as the year advances a higher rate of   .  ; &quot;     cereal consumption than that experienced during the summer will have to            beallowed for.  The stocks of meat display little change as  compared-    ;    :    with those of last year.&apos; &apos;   &apos;    ::  - V;-:   ;-:   .               .     4. Wholesale prices have varied but&apos;little, small decreases  occurring in some   .  -  -  -.: instances and small increases in  others.  On the  other hand retail prices&apos;:           still  tend to rise  with the exception  of some few commodities-cheese,     .  ,    butter, bacon, and fish being among these.  .   &quot; .   . s -&apos;   .-  &apos;  ...

A,, being 302,000 tons, compared with 303,000 tons in the preceding week, .210,000 tons. in the corresponding week  of  1916,  and an average of nearly 219,000 tons in the 27 weeks since the beginning of 1917.         /            :&apos;  .   :  The imports of&quot; wheat, sugar, oats, and cheese  continued at a high level.  Those of wheat,  which amounted to 184,000 tons,  compared with a weekly average  ;of 109,000 tons this year, were greater than in any previous week since the beginning of 1917,  The imports of oats were nearly 22,000 tons, compared with an average of 8,400 tons this year ; those of sugar (35,000 tons), though not so large as in the week ended 30th June (39,000 tOns), remained considerably above the average (24,000 tons); and  those  of cheese (5,000 tons) amounted to  nearly  double the  average  weekly importation this year (2,600 tons). - The quantities of wheaten flour, beef,  bacon, and glucose were also well above the average.  On the other hand, the imports of maize were only 13,000 tons, compared with an average, this year, of nearly 31,000 tons, and those of mutton, lard, margarine, and butter were also low.     The total imports, since the beginning of 1917, of fifteen of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs now amount to 5,902,000 tons, compared with 6,357,000 tons in the corre- .sponding period of 1916, showing a reduction of 455,000 tons, or about 7 per cent.  The articles mainly responsible for the deficiency are barley (238,000 tons), sugar (194,000 tons), and oats (118,000 tons).  There are  also  considerable reductions  in wheaten flour, beef,  mutton, hams, lard, and margarine.   The imports of  maize, however, are greater by 163,000 tons, and there are substantial increases in  cheese, butter, and glucose.  The total imports of wheat  since the beginning  of the year,  which during ,the past three months have shown a  heavy deficiency, have recovered to practically the same level as at the corresponding date of 1916,                        CONSUMPTION OF MEAT AND  BREAD.   ,  Meat. The  average weekly  supplies  of  dead  meat  entering  the  markets. at. London, Manchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool during June (Table B), were less  than in any previous  month of  1917, and 14 per cent,  below  those  of  June, 1916.  As compared with previous months of 1917 there was  a decrease at each of the  four markets, but the reduction  in comparison with June, 1916, was wholly accounted for by decreases at London (17 per cent.) and Manchester (7 per  cent.), the  supplies  at Liverpool and Glasgow showing increases of 2 per cent, and 3 per cent, respectively. During the week ended 7th July  the supplies in London were slightly  above-the ^average for June,  but were 8 per cent, below those for  the Corresponding&apos; week of 1916.      - ^                                     :      .          ;     ::: ;7     The  supplies of fat  cattle  received at  51 markets-  in  Great Britain  during the  week  ended 4th July  showed an. increase  of  13  per  cent, on those  of the -preceding  week, 2 per cent, on the average for  June, 1917, and 11- per cent, on the average of the-corresponding weeks in the years 1914-16.  The supplies of fat sheep wrere 26 per  cent, greater  than  in the preceding week and 11 per cent, above the average for June, but were slightly below the average for the corresponding week, of .1914-16.  The number of fat pigs received showed a further fall, being 15 per cent. less than in the preceding week, 29 per Cent, below the average for June, and 26 per cent, below the average for the corresponding weeks of 1914-16. &apos; &apos;: -  -V/.  Bread. In. the Report for the week ended 13th June, figures&apos;were given showing the quantity of flour used for bread-making and  confectionery, by 690 bakers in the four weeks ended  26th May, 1917, and it  was stated that arrangements were being made&apos; to obtain,&apos;  in  future; returns  covering a much larger  proportion  of  the - consumption.   Returns have now been obtained froni 6,600  bakers: and flour retailers/as to the quantities of flour used in  the. manufacture of bread and confectionery or sold direct to the public during the four weeks ended 23rd June, .with comparative ; figures for the four preceding weeks and^ for the corresponding period&apos;  of  1916, and the  information contained in these&apos; returns is. summarised below.   The  figures are preliminary, and  subject to revision, when .further  returns,. which  are  still, being received; are included:-,   &apos;   &apos;   &apos; .  ;  &quot;: &apos;     ; ; :                        -             .- &apos;                                            Quantity of Flour                                            .    .              used or sold                       Period.           :           r ;-    (Sacks&apos;of 280 lb.)...

     The^fio-ures (which, cover about-27-per cent, of the total consumption&quot;oi: bread and- flour in the United Kingdom)  indicate that there has been a reduction in the con-&quot;: sumption of flour, in the four weeks ended 23rd June, equivalent to over  5 per cent. as compared with the four weeks ended 26th May, 1917,  and to at least 3 per cent, as compared  with the four weeks ended  24th f Jane,  1916,  notwithstanding the great scarcity of potatoes this year..                                 ,     -  ,   ,.  .    . ,  :.. An examination of the returns, from different districts reveals that the diminution in consumption is --most - considerable in London and the.large towns . in England. Scotland and the country districts of England have reduced their consumption less, but still &quot;perceptibly.   In Ireland the decrease is nearly the  same as in England.     The following Table, combining the  results, of the. several enquiries which have recently been made on this  subject, shows the-course of consumption last year and this, taking March, 1917 (the first month for which substantial returns are available)0 as 100:-     .   &apos;                       -.  .    - -      -         .. ;                         .  ,   --------          1916.        1917, .:.

Savings  Committees for the week ended July 7th: corroborate the reduction in. the consumption - of bread thus depicted,  this   being attributed &apos; to  the.&quot;&apos;increase &quot;in the&quot; supplies/ of-.&quot; potatoes and other   vegetables,- particularly in London, the. Southern Counties and the country districts.   It is stated;&apos;&apos; however, that. in &quot;most -areas the high  price of meat is. still Compelling&quot; the poorer classes to. depend &quot;largely, on  bread for  sustenance, and that  any considerable reduction in the price of meat may he. expected to. lead-&apos;to. a further &quot;decrease in the consumption of bread,  . - &apos; &apos;      &quot;.       &apos; &quot;. --        J   &apos; &apos;-                 - -    .  -&apos;  r\    -           &apos;   -   - &apos;  STOCKS;  &apos;&quot;-&apos;-&apos;-.&apos;-     &apos; .    - -  ;   *  &apos;      -   &apos;     Li Table E particulars are given as to the stocks of principal foods&apos; and. feeding-. stuffs in the United Kingdom, at. 1st July,; 1917, comparative figures also being stated&apos; for a month before and a year.before.  &apos;    .    -  -                         , &apos;  - V ,...
