A.B.153/25.                                     21st July, 1917.rganisation.    1.      The Board have recently had under their             consideration the question.of the steps required to give             effect to paragraphs 2 and 3 of the statement of the             powers and functions of the  Air Board as approved &quot;by the             War Cabinet.   Theso paragraphs are as follows:-                       Tho1 Board shall be free to discuss matters of                  policy in relation to the air, and to make recommen-                  dations to the Admiralty and war Office thereon.                       The Admiralty and War Office will concert their                  respective aerial policies in consultation with the                  Air Board.                       Since its re-construction at the beginning             of this year, the Board has  been fully occupied with             the predominant problem of the supply to the two             Services of the aircraft urgently required for the             purpose of their authorised programmes.                       Now that the efforts of the Aeronautical             Supply Department have resulted in a situation in which             these requirements will be met, and a surplus beyond the             hitherto authorised programmes will become available,            i the question of policy involved in determining the            j precise mode of employment of the additional aircraft            ( will become of tho highest importance, and it becomes            I necessary to consider how the duty which tho War Cabinet            ! have laid upon the Air Board shall be discharged.                       The War Cabinet decided on the 11th instant             that a Committee composed of the Prime Minister and             General Smuts should consider &quot;the existing general             organisation for the study and higher direction of aerial             operations&quot;.   The President of the Air Board has laid             before General Smuts his views on the question, arrived             at as a result of the discussions which have taken place             at the Board.   Briefly, these may be said to be that             in order to secure a proper consideration of aerial             policy and a proper allocation of the aeronautical resources             of the country, the problems involved must receive the             continuous and concentrated attention of a staff of             officers specially qualified for the purpose and indepen-             dent of the two Services.   Officers dependent for             promotion and prospects on tho Admiralty or War Office             cannot be asked to express an impartial opinion  on these             problems, which frequently may entail differences of             opinion between the two Services.   It is difficult to             see how this independent staff is to be obtained unless             the decision is arrived at to create an independent Air             Service, distinct from the Army and the Navy, and at             least the initial steps taken to give effect to tho             decision, so as to inspire confidence in the officers who             might be asked to throw in their lot with the new service.
These Initial steps would consist of, firstly,the necessary legislation, and, secondly, thepreparation by a special staff got togetherfor the purpose of the King-!.9 Regulations, PayWarrant, and other regulations required for theadministration of the new Service.   The actualfusion of the Royal Naval Air Service and theRoyal Plying Corps could then follow, though itwould probably, not be found possible that thisshould take place during the continuance of theWar.  2.      A letter of which copy is annexed hasbeen addressed to Major Boiling, Head of theAmerican Government Mission in Europe, embodyingthe conclusions arrived at in the discussionswhich have taken place with a view to co-ordinatingthe aerial policies of the United States and thiscountry.          Subject to the concurrence of the AmericanGovernment which Major Boiling expects to obtain,this agreement may be considered of supremo importanceand the Board may be considered very fortunate inhaving been able to arrive at an agreement calculatedto insure that the American aerial forces shall comeinto play at the earliest possible date and with thegreatest efficiency.   The fact that the AmericanGovernment will act on the basis of our experiencea3 regards the selection of types of aeroplanesand engines and avoid new and untried designs, andwill co-operate fully with us in production, is amatter of supreme importance to the Allied cause.  3.      A long Conference was held on the 18thinstant between representatives of the AiarJbard,Colonel Yakowleff, Head of the Russian IlilitaryAir Service, and the Russian Naval and lltlitaryDelegates in England on the subject of thesupply of aircraft to Russia from this Country.Lord Cowdray expressed, on behalf of the AirBoard, the fullest desire to bo of assistance totho Russian Government but explained the diffi-culties which the question presented.   TheRussian delegates were informed, inasmuch as atelegram from General Brussiloff laid stressupon the importance of tho immediate despatchof aeroplanes- to Russia that 76 Sopwith l Strutter aeroplanes and 69 Sopwith Bomberstogether with a certain number of other mis-ceilansous machines could be despatched atonce provided that the Russians could obtainfrom France the Clerget engines to put intothem.   The Board believed.that the Frenchauthorities could be -induced to supply theseengines, but Colonel Yakowleff disagreed.The result of the discussion-,was to she?; thatno conclusion-was possible as to the machineswhich could with the greatest advantage bofurnished to Russia until Colonel Yakowleffshould have returned from his forthcomingvisit to Paris.   He would there ascertainprecisely what engines and machines Russia-can expect to receive from France and what                  -2-
          balance will remain of engines over aeroplanes, in respect          of which aeroplanes from this country will be required.   Thegl         question will  then be considered from the point of view  (l)          of the special types of machines which Russia needs and  (2) of          those which can with the least disadvantage be spared by the          British Expeditionary Eorce.Supply.      4.      A considerable number of machines both at the  Eront          and in training squadrons at home have recently been put out          of action by the absence of an adequate supply of spare  parts.          In some important instances this is due to the fact that spare          parts contracted for have been diverted by manufacturers to          the construction of complete machines so as to swell their          output.    The question has been under investigation and          energetic measures have been taken to make good the deficiency          and prevent its recurrence.            5.

20th July, 1917.         Sir,                   I am directed Toy the President of the Air Board,         aa arranged in the course of the conversations which have         taken place between tho representatives of tho Air Board         and yourself,  to summarise as folloi-B the principal points         of the agreement ^hich has been arrived at v-ith you for         the purpose of co-ordinating the aereial policies of the         American and British Governments.                   Tho President -ould be glad to receive your         formal approval of ^hat -follows on behalf of your Govern-         ment, so that the matter may be considered as no-1, in order.             (l)    The first accepted responsibility and duty of         the United States Government and their? -aviation Board         is to secure the prompt execution of all present         European contracts for aeronautical supplies net? under         construction in the United States.  These embraco tho         following 3,vitlsh contracts:-*             Vl)    Curtiss OX 5 motors for training purposes.  Ve                   are relying cn the completion of 2,000 of these                   motors not latere than 30th karoh, 1918.             (2)    Curtiss contract for 2-i HI2 and 75 12 flying                   boats.             (3)    Contract for crankshafts.                   Contract for A,G,S. parts.             (5)    Contracto for ball bear-rings.             (5)    Willys Overland Co&apos;s Canadian contract for                   1000 Sunbeam meters,  A portion of this rork                   is being done in the United States.             (7)    Various smaller contracts.            (XI)    The United States Government and Aviation Board         ongage to dovelope immediately a moBt energetic scheme         for increasing the cutting dorm of silver spruco to meet         the demands of the Allies and the United States Government.           (XII)    In principle, the United States Government and         Aviation Board ^ill adopt an agreed programme of types of         engines and aeroplanes from **hieh their aerial fleets rrtll         be constituted.  The programme of types discussed up to         date is as folios: rMajor Boiling,   c/o British Aviation Commission.         A, P. 0. So 5.            B . Jdl 1 P.              Prance.

           As regards (3) it is hoped that in four monthsit will he possible to recommend a further &quot;type of longdistance bomber, now under preparation.     (V)   Careful consideration discloses that the deliveryto Europe of complete aeroplanes in large numbers is quiteinadmissible from the point of view of/tonnage *  Aocci-ding-ly no complete aeroplanes for United States jileet shouldbe shipped to France as aeroplanes, all machines should cometo Europe unassembled, and be assembled, covered and dopedin Europe, preferably in France.    (VI)   In connection with timber supply, especially ofSilver Spruce to Great Britain, it will be necessary tocut out the timber very close to the finished size and tohave a rigid inspection system to avoid the shr-pment ofunsuitable timbero  In connection with the cutting cutand planing of this timber, the American Government u$llarrange the necessary facilities for the Ministry ofMunitions Aeronautical Supply Department.   (VII)   As an insurance against.any breakdown in theBritish programme of engine supplyf the Air Beard desireto place orders in America under which American contxac-tors would deliver to this country 500 engines uer month,commencing in January 1918 and covering a total deliveryof 3,000 engines:  these engines should be of the B.H.P.,or Fiat or Renault type, provided, as regards the Renault,that it can be fitted into a suitable machine.   TheAmerican Government agree to this,           Further, the American Government agree to GreatBritain obtaining, if necessary, in the United States upto 300 Curtiss or other good training motors per monthafter Maroh 1918.  (VIII)   The Air Board desire to point out to theAmerican Government the urgent necessity, for their makingarrangements for the supply of maehine guns for aircraft,as no assistance to the United States can be given fromBritish sources.    (IX)   I am further to ask for your confirmation ofthe arrangement come to between yourself, Sir William Weirand Major Baird in Paris on Thursday the 12th July, 1917,to the following effect:-     (l)   The American Government, in addition to theconstructional programme of Engines and Aeroplanes formanufacture in the United States,  will also have a pro-gramme of manufacture of machines  to be supplied by Frenchmanufacturers.   The British Air Board recognise that thecharacter of this programme is largely a question of expe-dien-jy and must depend on the types of engines and aero-planes most easily procurable in France at the oresentdate when orders have to be placed, and accordingly,  suchprogramme cannot be of an ideal character such as has beensuggested for the constructional programme in America.     (2)   It is recognised, however, and agreedto by you, that the carrying out of this programme
 in Prance  must not be  allowed in any way to&apos;interfere&apos;with&apos;the execution  of^British Contracts in Prance,  such contracts representing,  approximately,  9,000 motors&apos;.&apos;/. ;&quot;:- *-       (.3)    Accordingly,  it is agreed thrt the United  States Authorities  will  do their utmost to assist the French manufacturers  to  carry &amp;ut their present commitments to the British  Government and that no motors  can be delivered to the  United  States Government from these contractors until the British  Contracts  have been completed.                    ;       (4)    Further, Lajcr Boiling has been given to&apos;runder-&apos;&quot; stand that after  completion of these contracts,  Great Britain will still require a delivery of 500 motors per&apos;   v.&apos; mcnth from French manufacturers,  and he agrees that such  - deliveries shall  take  precedence of American deliveries. &apos;;-   &apos;    , \           ^          ;v                          &apos;-&apos; -       (5)    It was agreed^th^tfta joint demand will be  - - made at once to the FrenchVGoyernnent for  the construction. of 1000 80 h.p. le Khonejengihes for training purposes,     \ to be made by  the Gnome ^nd Le Rhone Company;   these motors  ;; to be all  delivered&apos;&apos;&apos;before 31st December,  1917.    The  first 500 to&apos;be  delivered to Great Britain and the next 500-to-America.   ;  %:j   *  vj.  (X)        I  am  further to state that the British Govern-- ment are willing  to undertake the liability during the War for any financial-arrangements to be made  with British owners  of  patent  rights in the aeroplanes  and aero-       J engines, with  their accessories which are  to be manu-      -;&apos;,r- factured in  the United States in accordance with the pro- gramme  indicated  in this letter,  subject of course to    .-  \ . the American Government accepting, liability for such arrangements after the .;&apos;ar, particularly a.e regards partially  protected designs having a commercial value.                       I am, Sir,                             Your obedient  Servant,(Sgd.) H.P.Earvey.
