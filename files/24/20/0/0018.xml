 n^erationsy                                SECRET Prom     General Delme Radcliffe. *                                      July 14th 1917. To  l-    C.I.G.S.                     Handed  in 11 p^m.    247*   Your 37637 July 12th. PERSONAL AND SECRET.    Today Cadorna informed me that he cannot  begin his  (2  grou undecipherable) JULIAN front until August 20ths  He will have to  bring artillery and troops back from  the mountains  on the Trentino front and this must take time.  Also he has much reorganization to carry out and, before  being employed; the fresh  troops require as much training as possible^    He does not think half measures wise as they lead  only to small  results and much loss.  When he does attack he will  do so  with all his available strength and with the utmost  vigour. He  has telegraphed to Brusilov  to inform him  of the above0    Cadorna says he recognizes  that the  Austrians may possibly send away 4 or 6 divisions from Italian  to Eastern front but in view of the large forces engaged  this  oannot make muoh difference, he remarked that some troops have been similarly transferred from French front.   He feels certain that,  owing to  strength of Italian Army, the Austrians will not venture to  send many Divisions from Italian front,  It is known that Austrians were expecting a great Italian offensive between July 10th and July 20th and still in daily expectation  of its beginning.    Cadorna said he thought that if the  Russians maintained their  pressure this with the Italian offensive would lead to  the disintegration of the Austrian Army,    He had, he said, always considered this to be the strategical object which the Allies should strive for  as if attained it v^ould automatically cut off  Bulgarians and  Turks from their conjunction with Germany and  make  it possible to act with overwhelming effect against Germany. He said  he doubted the possibility of defeating Germany  on the Western front  as even if pushed back further the Germans could  still take up a line resting on River Meuse and their fortresses. and for a long time to come continue to  defy  any enemy0 It  was for this reason, he said, that he had  always urged to  be  supplied with more heavy  artillery as it was heavy artillery which was most important for the offensive and it is  the arm in which unfortunately he is  most  deficient.. He  said he thought the French desired to concentrate all interest on the Front in France and were reluctant to give much artillery help to Italy as, speaking frankly, they were rather jealous of any-military  success that Italy might achieve,,                     -       ,
