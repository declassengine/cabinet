twenty at the end.  Taking these numbers into consideration, the results achievedwere comparatively small.  The heavy losses on the south-west coast of Ireland appearto have been due to the submarines locating each of the last two approach routes-theday before they were changed.    The submarine which bombarded Ponta del Gada, Azores, on 4th July, has nowbeen at sea for over six weeks and appears to he making her way slowly homewards,the last authentic report placing her  300 miles to the east of the Azores.   It has beenreported  that  she  and another submarine which are attacking merchant-ships  at thepresent time are armed with 5 &quot;9-inch guns.   One of them is probably the commercialsubmarine &quot; Deutschland,&quot; which was reported some time ago  as having been convertedfor this purpose.   It is expected  that six enemy submarines armed. with-5*9-inch gunswill be ready for service by the end of the year.  &apos; Twenty-two encounters with enemy submarines have  been reported during thepast week, and in one of these it is probable that one was destroyed.    As regards mining by &quot; U.C.&quot; boats, activity has been experienced in the vicinityof the Orkneys, Shetlands, East  coast of England, and  South of Ireland; eighty-sixmoored mines  have been destroyed during the week.                             - - NEUTRAL  SHIPPING.    Although the Naval Weekly Appreciation has hitherto  confined its remarks onthe sinking of ships to British vessels, a large proportion of  our own and Allied tradeis carried in neutral bottoms, and as the curve  of  available  tonnage approaches  thedanger line its protection becomes more and more important.  This requires specialattention in view of the approach of the winter months, for if the risks remain as highas they are now some of the neutral crews will be effectually deterred from sailing.    The present position with regard to neutral shipping is  that certain agreementshave  been concluded with Greece, Norway, and Denmark, which place the whole oftheir surplus shipping at the disposal  of  the Allies.  On the assumption  that theirimports are restricted to the  minimum  necessary for the support of their population,on the basis of no exports to Germany, the shipping available for Allied use will be.approximately :                     -  &apos;	Greece.	Norway.	Denmark.Steam tonnage available for general service, including Europe, over 500 tons Steam tonnage available ouiside the.war zone over 500 tons ...........	Tons. 450,000 * - -* -	Tons. 1,750,000 . 500,000*	Tons. 200,000 300,000     The Norwegian agreement also provides for the employment on Allied service overseas of the whole of their ocean-going sailing fleet, aggregating some 650,000 tons.     These agreements therefore  plaee  at  the   disposal of  the Allies  a total  of 3*2 million tons of steam shipping, and as on the 31st May, 1917, the British  shipping- employed; on the whole trade of  the United Kingdom was only 5-9 million.tons,.it is evident that this neutral shipping is a factor of some size and importance. :;  . Up to the present it has been possible to make good most of the losses of neutral shipping trading in Allied service,  by  bringing  in other ships  engaged on  purely neutral Irade.  The. new shipping agreements, however, mark the limit of  pressure, and from: now onwards every neutral ship lost will directly reduce  the imports into France or Italy, and to a lesser extent this  country.   The loss of even 100,000 tons.of- neutral shipping means the reduction of coal imports into France by 1&quot;2 million tons per annum or its equivalent on other service. As neither France nor Italy can develop-their full offensive powers unless  their coal imports are maintained, the protection of neutral shipping is obviously a question of  great military importance.    :^ * This tonnage is at present on time-charter outside Europe, but the greater part of it will become available tor general service during 19l7 and the early part of PJ1S, being replaced where necessary from the 300,000 tons belonging to Denmark.         .
: ::  The following figures show that the rate of sinking amongst neutral ships is muchhigher than British:                                    .	Inwards. [	Outwards.Percentage of tonnage of British ships on passage to or from the United Kingdom lost by mines or submarines between the 4th June and the 7th.

Per Cent. 7-6 22*2	Per Cent. &apos; 3-7 12-6    The reason for the relatively high percentage of loss  amongst neutrals employedon British trade is probably the lack  of defensive  armament and control, and  unlesssteps are quickly taken to afford more adequate protection, a very appreciable part  ofthe tonnage on which a successful ending  to  the war depends will either be sunk  orfrightened off the sea.    It therefore appears that the neutrals will have to be included in the convoy system.in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, or that British crews will have to be provided beforethe winter sets in.  The  latter, however, are  not available, and could only be obtainedby special organisation and training..                       - OPERATIONS IN THE NORTH SEA.;    In accordance with Admiralty orders, the Harwich force, consisting of eight lightcruisers and  seventeen  destroyers,  proceeded on the evening  of  the 15th July  tointercept Germah merchant  ships which were  reported to  be  leaving  the  Hook  ofHolland during the night.                                .    The squadron reached a position about  15 miles west of the Texel at 2&apos;45 a.m.*on the 16th, and  at 4T5 A.M. proceeded to the southward so as to keep  10 miles off thecoast, a light cruiser and three destroyers being placed 3 miles nearer the shore to cutoff any  ships  that might make  for territorial waters.  At 4*30 a.m. a  number  ofsteamers were sighted ahead which proved to be German.   They were at once  chasedby the destroyers, the two leading  ships being quickly  captured,  and prize crewsplaced on board.   The remaining four, which were slightly in rear, promptly made forthe shore.  Of these, two  were  captured  and two  ran  ashore.   The  latter Were,however, disabled by gunfire  and  will probably  become  total wrecks.  The  fourprizes succeeded  in reaching  Harwich in safety after being three times attacked bysubmarines between the North Hinder and Shipwash.    The success: of   this  operation will probably  do much to check  enemy tradebetween Rotterdam and Scandinavian and German ports.                               Minor  Operations.    On the 11th July the machines of the  Royal Naval Air Service dropped Ql  tonsof bombs on St. Denis  Wcstrcm, Ostend electric-power .  station, and various &quot;otherplaces of military importance.    The laying of deep mines in the vicinity of Portland has been completed.                  :SUMMARY OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.

     Our submarines1 in the Baltic, have been told  to  sink on sight German vessels engaged in  the  ore  trade  between Lulea-,  Oxelosund, and German ports, care being taken not to attack vessels in neutral territorial waters.                          &apos;&apos;:  ;&apos;     Six to eighteen German ships carrying ore and coal from LuleS, to. Germany leave Lulea- every other day, and are convoyed by four Swedish  T..B.-s as far as Ivvarken, where they are taken over by German T.B.&apos;.s.                  &apos; -;Russia.                               .     The situation in Russia is  generally less  favourable than it has been for some weeks.  The Baltic Fleet is considered to be in an unsatisfactory condition, and it has shown  no activity recently.   The destroyer  and submarine services  adhere to the Provisional Government, and they are reported to have threatened to attack the larger ships  should  the latter  attempt  any demonstration against Petrograd.   Discipline in the  fleet generally continues  to  be bad.  There is a rumour, of a German combined naval and military offensive against Riga and the Gulf of Finland. ...    .: Our submarines in the  Baltichave been ordered  to  operate against the German ore traffic in the Southern Baltic ; Russian naval authorities excuse the co-operation of their flotillas on the ground.that  German ships from LuleS, invariably follow Swedish territorial waters.     There has been no information from the Black Sea since the &quot; Breslau &quot;  episode.         *v: -.      /:&apos;;-.                 Sweden.     A protest has been made at Berlin by the Swedish Minister against the&apos;sinking of Swedish fishing craft, which had. aroused great indignation in Sweden.  The Swedes propose in future to escort these vessels.   .            .                     Norway.        -                &apos;.   . Prince Henry of  Prussia  has confirmed the sentence,  of  fining imposed on themaster and the mate of the steamship &quot; Thorunn,&quot; and the ship is being placed in thePrize Court.   The action of the Norwegian Government will be watched with interestsince the capture  was stated to have taken place within tiie 3-mile limit.  The sentencewas passed on the ship&apos;s officers for resisting German guards after capture.               .: WEEKLY SUMMARY OF AIR INFORMATION,  No. 7. 1. General Information. -     (a.) It  is reported that a new&quot; Gotha&quot; four-seater triplane is being constructed. This machine is said to have two 150 h.p. six-cylinder engines and a climb of 6,000 feet in twenty minutes.  It has a maximum range of 500 miles,  and can cany, in addition to a crew of four men, 400 lbs. of bombs, one quick-firing  gun, three machine guns, and 120 gallons of petrol.                  -     (b.) It  is reported that the German authorities will shortly publish &quot; the regula-: tions pertainirig to : aerial communications &quot;  (&quot; Luft-Verkehrsgesetz&apos;&apos;).;   One of  its cardinal points will be, according to this report, the declaration of taking over  by the State of all aerial services.     (c.) ^ It is reported by an observer  captured on the 30th  June that the number of officer pilots is largely increasing and that the n.c.o. pilots are becoming much fewer. Pilots  and observers get a fortnight to three weeks&apos; leave every three months.     (d.) It  is estimated that during the first fortnight of June 1917 100  square miles of standing  crops on the Macedonian front were totally destroyed by fires  started with petrol  bombs.                                                  ;v       &quot;     Naval Stafft&apos; &quot;:&apos;   -         July 18,  1917.           &apos;  &apos;                                           &apos;
