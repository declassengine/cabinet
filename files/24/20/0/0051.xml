    &quot;   .    IGaiORATODM QQHg QUESTION Of MAKING THE : MUNITIONS 03? WAR ACTS BIND DIG- UPON THiT CROWN.  :       :;  The Ministry of Munitions recently submitted, for the consideration of the Treasury,  the Admiralty,  and the War Office a proposal to make the Munitions  of War Acts binding upon the Crown,  oither in all particulars  or  at least in  so far  as the provisions which  they contain  as to arbitration in trade disputes are concerned.   It is proposed to  insert  an amendment in tho Munitions  of War Bill at present before Parliament providing that in  tho case  of a difference  as  to rates  of wages,  conditions  of employment, eto*,  in a Government  ^actory,  either party  to the  differenee should be  at  liberty to refer the matter to  arbitration. Neither tho Treasury, nor  tho Admiralty, nor the War Office approve of this  amendment.  After considering carefully the representations made by thoso throe Departmenta, I feel tho matter to be  of  such importance aS to make it desirable that I should submit it to the decision of the War Cabinet.          As  is well known,&quot;the-Crown is not bound by a Statute unless so bound by the express terms of the Statute itsolf, or by necessary implication.   This rule,which is based on the legal fiction that the King  can dono wrong,  extends not only to the Crown itself but  to  theMinisters and Public  Officials being servants of tho Crownthrough whom the  Crown acts.          So/
           So  far as  regards  the ordinary executive procedure  of  the Government  and Government  Departments, the  rule may  he  supported  on the ground  of  public convenience,  but it  must be  remembered that the  duties of the Ministry  of Munitions  under the Munitions of War Acts  extend far  beyond mere  functions of executive governmenty including as they do the management  and control of the ino3t  considerable industries of the country.          In  addition to the  general supervision of the Munitions industry, there are a large number of factories * e,g*  the Royal Ordnance Factories, theNational IPilling factories, and other national factories,the business  of which is actually conducted by theMinistry itself.   In other words, the Ministry ofMunitions is now the largest employer of labour  in thecountry.          (The scheme of the Munitions of VJar Acts isbased upon the reciprocal rights and obligations ofemployers and workmen,  and almost every obligationunder the Act is  balanced by a corresponding right,          Q?ho Ministry of Hunitions and GovernmentDepartments such  as  the Admiralty and War Office form.,as things stand,  an  exoeption to this general scheme.$lie workmen in CroY/n and national factories  are  subjectto all the obligations  imposed on munitions  workmen  bythe/
 ill the Acts; and they hare not the corresponding rights, because the Ministry or a Government Department being for legal purposes regarded as the Crown,  and therefore not bounn. by the Acts j  is under no obligation to observe their provisions.  Again the Ministry or a Government Department,  owing to  its privileged position,  can and does enforce the Acts against employers  who have no legal redress when it acts in a way which  would render them liable  to prosecution.   It is true  that  in practice the  Ministry has generally acted in the  same  way as if it were bound by the Acts.  e.g*  has  permitted  claims for  leaving  certificates,  compensation,  etc. by workmen to be made  against  the  Crown and national factories without  objection, but at  the  same time there have been  cases in which the Ministry has refused to permit differences arising between the Crown and its  employees to be referred to arbitration under Part 1. of the 1915 Act.          Under  Section 1 of the 1916 Act there is power by order to declare Government factories to be controlled establishments, and thereupon theprovisions relating to controlled establishments apply, subject to such modifications and exceptions necessary to adapt the provisions as may be specified.-  The ordersunder this section omit the penal provisions,  and thewording of the section does not suggest in  any way that such/
 suck eestablishments, are sub j ect  to  part 1*  of the Act of 1915,  which deals with compulsory arbitration.           It  seems  desirable  that where munitions workers are employed under the Grown,  the Munitions of War Acts should  bind the Grown as if the  employer were a private  person.           It  is obviously one-sided that the Grown should have the right to prosecute  its employers  for striking  or otherwise infringing the Acts, but that the employees should have  no  correlative rights as against the Crown.           The Crown as  a model employer  should be willing to  submit the conduct of its  servants  and agents to the review of a Munitions Tribunal.  If  the decision appears to  be wrong, an appeal  lies to the High Court, except where  the  question  is solely  one of  fact.  Similarly, the Crown  should be willing to submit differences under  : Part 1. of the principal Act to the arbitration tribunals named  in the First Schedule.           It is no legislative novelty for workmen to have statutory rights against the Crown, for both the Workmen1s  Compensation Act and the Factories Acts aremade expressly binding on the  Crown so far as regardsworkmen employed in Crown factories, and I feel that the same principle might well be extended to the Munitions of War Acts.   But the particular  point which I considerurgent/                  -
urgent for the moment.is that the  Crown  shouldpermit differences arising between itself and itsworkmen on or in connection with munitions work to becompulsorily referred to arbitration under Part 1. ofthe 1915 Act.  Such a measure seems to me to be nomore than bare justice,  and the continued, refusalwould I think be a cause of well-founded dissatisfactionand would lay the Government open to a charge ofone-sided dealing-.                             (Intld,)    C&apos;*A:*                                    16th.ii ,July,  1917.
