                                                 ADMIRALTY,                                                10th July.N. 58050.Sir,        With reference to your letter of the 30th June,No.P/2049/R.M.,  I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners ofthe Admiralty to inform you that the number of men enlistedhitherto during 1917 from the Coal-mining industry,  into theNavy cannot be obtained.  As however the enlistment cf minershas-been prohibited during thi3 period the numbers acceptedcannot be large.  The number entered in future will beprovided from time to time.            4        My Lords note that 40,000 men are now being releasedfrom the industry and consider that, in view of the factthat such a measure is possible, the prohibition of the en-listment of miners in the Royal Navy, can now be withdrawn.Steps are accordingly being taken to secure the requisite pro-portion for the Naval Service advertising in the districtsaffected to the effect that a limited number of vacancies forstokers exist in the Royal Navy.        A copy of the correspondence is being forwarded to theWar Office.                                         I am, etc.,                                      (Sd.) W.
