The first meeting of our Committee was held on February8th 1917*   The Shipping Controllers opinion th&amp;t  ships  could beturned round more quickly if the Railways.-could-handle the wagonsmore expeditibusly was not,i%. appeared,  shared &quot;by  the RailwayCompanies or by the Ministry of Munitions who considered  thatsufficient allowance had not been made for delay in operations forwhich Port Authorities and Consignees were alone responsible,and which would go far to render useless  any speeding  up  of  thehandling on Railway traffic. -           In view of our instructions to report immediately,  wedid not at the outset enter into any very detailed  investigations,but we called and;examined on Tiroad lines representatives ofvarious interests who could speak from personal experience ofconditions at five important ports, namely, London,  Bristol,Liverpool, Manchester and the Clyde.  :           The following witnesses gase evidence:1&quot;   .

The transit system
of the: country is concerned, as any transit system must be,  withfour chief interests,  Shipowners,  Dock Authorities, Land TransportAuthorities,  (Rail, Road or Canal), and Consignees, and, in timeof peace, these various interests  had competed rather than co-operated.   There had thus grown-up practices which, with thecomparatively ample margins available in peace- time of labour,storage capacity, wagon supply, locomotive power and man power,did not result in any very serious difficulties.   But with the;;shrinkage of those margins due to  a prolonged state of war,  theefficiency of the general transit  system of the country necessarilydeteriaated.            or instance, in times  of peace the Railways in theirdesire to obtain traffic vied with each ether in allowing warehousefacilities either in wag.-ns or stores to private traders,a,nd, notunnaturally,  the private trader neglected to provide storageaccommodation for himself.   For ;co&amp;l and iron ore in particularimportant works often counted en receiving regularly from theRailways a day to day supply. -  In some of the Ports a similarsystem- had grown up and local/merchants wre(allowed the use oftransit sheds as warehouses and certain berths were appropriatedto individual &quot;shipping:lines although on occasions serious delayto ships might-result.   Even after nearly three years of war theselong-established practices have by no means completely disappeared.           At the moment, the only course open to us was to makecertain recommendations to which effect could immediately begiven leaving to a later stage consideration of any generalalterations of practice or details which required investigation onthe spot.           We accordingly made the following recommendations anddrew the attention of the War Cabinet to the following points.The action which has since been taken has undoubtedly produced amarked improvement.                                   &quot;  %           (l)  Prohibit sale of British wagons for export except                obsolete ones.           (2)  Give Railway Companies the right to use empty wagons                on the return journey.           (3)  That measures should be taken ancL,. if necessary,                Railway Companies  should be givenA^ower to enforce the                prompt emptying of wagons at destination.           There has probably never been any very serious actualshortage of Railway wagons - certainly not sinoe the RailwayCompanies&apos; wagons were partially pooled - having regard to the volumeof traffic which had to be carried:  but the excessive detentionof wagons in various works or in sidings owing to the failure ofconsignees to accept delivery resulted from time to time in a seriousshortage of available empty wagons.&quot;.  Even this admitted shortageho^^ever, was not so great as some  Dock Authorities seemed tothink.
   ;  :The question of wagon supply, however,  seemed likely to become mucii more serious  beoalee of the demands made by the r.&apos;ar Office for wagons fcr France;  and the prohibition of salo of wagons for oxV-rc was an obvious  precaution.  It . was not intended., of course, that this prohibition should ie absolute as from time to  time wagons are  sold for  export which are not in a condition to be used on any British Hallway;  ,Ihe decision of the ;*sr Cabinet that export of wagons .should be prohibited  except under licence of the Board of Trade meets the requirements of the situation in this respect, ; &apos;   Me made careful examination of the arguments for and against pooling privately owned wagons.  There was a consensus of opinion that, pooling private wagons immediately would not produce anything like the same advantage as had-resulted from pooling Eailway owned wagons,  and there was  a risk of difficulties arising which might impede the flow of traffic.  At present the wagons owned by a particular firm run backwards or fupwards on a particular route, and  their traffic management has become almost automatic  If private. ownersr wagons were pooled,  the routing of the wagons would require a. great deal moro administrative attention for which staff with the&quot;necessary experience was not  available; moreover, the arrangements made by private owners for the regular repair of their wagons would be disturbed and the various Contractors would almost certainly call for a revision of their contracts.  iVe are assured however  that the Railway Executive Committee do not regard tha question as definitely closed and are continuing their enquiries.     .It was generally agreed that a safe and profitable measure would be to give the Railway Companies power  to load privately, owned wagons  for any point on a reasonable homeward journoy.  On the, Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, where this practices has been in force for some years  by arrangement, it is estimated- that the effective, supply of wagons is by this measure increased by about 10^..-The practice is now general.  -The results have been excellent.     If the Var go03 on much longer the supply of Railway Wagons will become a very serious- question-:  It should be &quot;borne in mind, that apart from any demand for abroad the; prosit ion; is bound to get worse for the following reasons:-     (1)  The difficulty of  building new trucks.     (2).  The fact that many of the wagons now running,          in ordinary course would have been scrapped and          replaced.  The result is an increase in the          repairs which makes increasingly difficult,  for         ; the Railways to keep a proper proportion, of&quot;&apos;-&apos;-T-         \ trucks/running.  -     1/e do not desire to exaggerate the gravity of the position but we wish to emphasize the importance of everything possible being done to husband wagon supply.
     The power which sinco we made our recommendation hasbeen conferred upon Railway Companies to unload and warehousecompulsorily at the expense of the consignee, goods ofwhich prompt delivery is not accepted, will undoubtedlyassist in promoting a free flow of traffic, and so relsasingwagons and clearing transit sheds,   A case in point atBristol came under our notice.  2,500 tons of bacon in sixcwt. cases had been lying for three weeks in a transitshed completely blocking the berth, because the consigneeswarehouses.and.the Great Western Railway warehouses inLondon were full.  The Great&apos; Western RailY/ay at oursuggestion exercised or threatened to exercise their newpower of compulsory warehousing and the shed was&apos; clearedwithin 48 hours.     In our opinion this question is one for which constantattention is required, and we think that prompt investigationof all cases of delay in accepting deli?evy, followed ifnecessary by exercise of the power to warehouse compulsorilywill do more than almost any other single reform to expeditetho disposal of traffic,     Shortly before wo began our enquiry shortage of labour&apos;was, as indeed it is still, generally evident,,  Moreover, thelabour available, owing to the withdrawal of physically fitand experienced men for&quot; the Army, was about 30^1 less efficientthan in normal times.     The Transport Workeess1&apos;Battalions we found had beenvery useful though their activity had been greatlyhampered by the delay in&apos;obtaining men from tho Yiar Offiec-The. War Cabinet had authorised their increase to 10.000 butat this time the BatJ;al3.cns were still 4,000 men belowtheir strengths  It was obviously important that theBattalions should be brought up to full strength withoutdelay..  This has now been done.  &apos;     We drew attention in our preliminary report to fivepoints in which shortage of labour was most felt. .          Shortage of lighterage owing to labour trouble          with lightermen&apos; in the Port of London.          Shortage of labour on Canals which throws more          work on Railways.          Shortage of labour for repairing Railway engines.          Shortage of carting facilities at port and          destination on account of shortage of labour. -          Difficulty of loading and unloading wagons at          port and destination on account of shortage          of labour.y   -         -&quot;K^--&apos;-^^//&quot;/y;(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)     Since wo submitted our  preliminary report  the  number  ofships entering commercial ports in the  United kingdom hasfallen off owing to the development of  the  submarinecampaign and the shortage of labour everywhere  has  becomeless marked.   The  quality,  however,  naturally  has  not  :improved and there  is a general tendency ih the ports - noton the railways - for men to work on the &quot;ca-canny&quot;principle.  .                                     V     -V:
        In this connexion &quot;before going further we shouldperhaps refer to the success of a practice generally adoptedon Railways fer increasing the output without the frictiongenerally caused by speeding up methods.   The practiceconsists in payment of a minimum weekly wage representingan amount equivalent to the weekly wage ordinarily paid,with a bonus of so much per ton for every ton of goodshandled above the amount ordinarily handled on the samework under the weekly wage system.   The tonnage handled hasof course usually to be calculated on the output of gangsand not of individuals, which has certain obvious advantages.        The introduction of this system in a particular instancewas at first opposed by the men on the ordinary groundsof Trade Union theory:  but they were told that wages thenext week or so would be paid on the minimum wage plusbonus system, but that it was cptn to men earring a bonusto hand it back if they object-ad to receive it.   The bestmen earned a certain amount of bonus the first week anddid not hand it back. &apos;  The next week, becoming ratherinterested in the possibilities of the scheme., they earned abonus equivalent to an increase of     of their regularwage.  Practically all the men are now earning bonus, theirobjections have disappeared, and &quot;ca-canny&quot; working on thepart of members of a gang is summarily dealt with by theirown colleagues-   All parties profit and the general feelingis better.   We appreciate the difficulties of the generalintroduction of such a scheme, but we hope it will &quot;beintroduced wherever possible,   We are not sure that itsintruduction even in the Pert of Glasgow is altogether outof the question^   A good deal of dock work is alreadycarried on at piece rates.        Acting on the War Cabinets instructions    asked theDirector of ITaticnal Service to supply for employment atRailway depots about 3;00C men.        The Railway Executive Committee submitted a scheduleshowing the number of men required by the various Railway&apos;Companies, ana the Director of National Service anticipatedthat they could be supplied at an early date, at the rate ofabout 700 &amp; week.   Three months, however, went by, and nota single man was forthcoming.   The Ministry of NationalService attempted to attribute the. responsibility forthis to the failure of the Railways to agree to certainconditions of employment and to furnish particulars required,but, in our opinion, the real and indeed the only difficultywas the hopeless mismanagement of the National Service Schisme.        We have not pressed the matter for some time pastpartly because we felt that correspondence with the NationalService Ministry would lead to no result, and partly becausethe restriction of imports and the submarine campaign hadtemporarily reduced the amount of work to be done and madethese 3,000 men&apos;for the moxiient less necessary.   The recentdemands upon the Railways, however,  for men, the greateruse being made of Western Ports with resulting longer haulagein many cases- and the entry of the U.S.A, into the war will,
 apart from the ordinary winter difficulties, make the position cf the Hallways next winter very serious, and, in our opinion unless a substantial reserve of civilian or military labour is available for use on Railways as required, there is likely to be very serious congestion and possibly a complete::breakdown of traffic. ; -      We are aware of the objections to using special civilian labour because of the risk of labour troubles, but we are inclined to think that too much stress is apt to be laid on these apprehensions,  ^he introduction of female labour - a far more serious matter from the Trade Union point of view- has been generally accepted.  The employment of the Transport V/orkers1 Battalion has caused no difficulty^ having been readily acquiesced in by Ordinary labour, both Dockers and Railway men, and we do not think the introduction, temporarily within proper limits and with reasonable safeguards of special civilian labour would lead to any serious trouble.      we are glad that the very useful reserve of labour provided by the 10,000 men of the Transport &quot;workers1 Battalions is now being much more freely used.  Last month they worked 150,000 days, a record up to the present.  So far as we can judge, employers of: ordinary labour have been in the past on the whole rather over cautious in the employment of the men of the Battalions for fear of the effect upon ordinary civil labour.  V/here the Battalions have been employed however, so far from difficulties having arisen, the efficiency of ordinary labour has been enhanced, sometimes by as much as 25$, and so far from any hostility to the soldiers having been shown, there has boon in many oases a tendency, on the part of dockers at any rate, to help thornu  It is of course necessary that the Battalion should only be made use of where there is not sufficient ordinary civilian labour available to deal promptly with the work on hand.      There is a shortage of skilled labour and difficulty in obtaining materials for the repair of Railway locomotives. Up to recently the position was serious, though possibly not critical.  More engines are laid up for repair than in normal times and this is the more serious because the transfer of engines from British Railways to France has so, depleted the reserve that as an ordinary rule engines throughout the country are in oontinuous use without the customary interval for overhaul and minor repairs.   The breakdown of even a&quot;few locomotives which could not be, immediately repaired might quite possibly during the-winter reduce the available engine pov/er below the minimum required adequately to deal with&apos;traffic, and so cause continually increasing congestion everywhere.      The recent largely increased demands of the Viar Office amounting to the supply of 200 engines for abroad make the position undoubtedly critical and we think the serious risk of holding up the transport of the country makes it imperative that men should be withdrawn from the Army in suffioient numbers to make possible the immediate repair of any locomotives requiring it, making due allowance for the increased need for repairs likely to arise owing to neglect of regular overhauls and the increased work which has to be got out of each locomotive.  Only a few men at the m-st will be required;  the effect on the Army will be negligible, and would be amply justified by results.
        We have failed to  induce the War Office to  release from  the Army men for work on canals.  Indeed, we understand that  since we  reported, the supply of Canal labour has been  still further depleted, but as this aspect of the question  is being dealt with by  the Canal Control Committee and the Controller of Coal Mines, who have been appointed since our enquiry  began,  we have  left the1 matter largely  in their hands.   Any relief which, they cea afford the Railways by diverting to canals any of their normal traffic or. traffic  which before the war    carried  coastwise, will be very valuable.   We are glad to. hear  that the Transport Workers1 Battalion  is now  to be used for work on  Canals.        In this connection we desire to draw  attention to the importance of saving unnecessary haulage on rail  wherever possible.   We gather that in the past, the War Office and the Admiralty have been responsible for a great deal  of unnecessary haulage.   The cases to which we refer in  our ne:.t  paragraph are cases in point.  We do nor propose to  deal ax, any length with this matter;   bit we  hope that the importance  will be realised of remedying cases of unnecessary haulage  which though individually are possibly  insignificant, in the aggregate are important.  Particularly is it necessary  to avoid short hauls on rail - anything up to 12 miles. -  especially over congest- ed  rails and bottlenecks.   There are various instances,  such as between Avonmouth and Bristol, and between Liverpool and Pasackerley where Road haulage could probably without any great difficulty be substituted  for Rail haulage.   For  this purpose military transport  is suitable - a very effective system  has been in. operation in London - and in view  of  the  scarcity of petrol we have arranged with the Ministry  of  Munitions for a census to be taken  of steam motor tractors which  might be available for this  purpose with the intention of  requisitioning them0        We&apos;have received complaints from every side of the disrega: of  proper routing shown by government Departments.   In many cases., for instance, goods are sent long distances for inspection and returned to.the point of starting when a much shorter journey would have sufficed or they could have been inspected on  the spot.. The fact that Government Departments are not  charged for  carriage perhaps tends to produce negligence in this respect.  The matter requires very careful watching.        We called attention to the use by  the Government  in certain cases of sites in  lSock areas for other than their designed purpose. ..Our investigations showed that there remained only three cases to which serious objection need be raised, namely,,the Base Supply Depot at Avonmouth, the A.S.C. Depot at Sandon Dock, Liverpool, and at the Docks connected with  the Gloucester  &amp; Berkely Canal at: both Gloucester and Sharpness..   In accordance with the War Cabinet1s instructions.we took up with the War Office the question of the removal of the  two first-mentioned depots.  They agreed to remove at once the depot  at Avonmouth but we  now understand they have deferred any action till October. We  are taking the master up again as we consider  this delay is unjustifiable.  They have  not so far agreed to remove the depot at Sandon Dock.  The Shipping Controller  raises no  objection to its retention but we think that in  the interests of the Railways  serving the Port. i&apos;*s removal will probable be necessary.   If the further\investigations which we are making confirm us in our-opinion, the  matter will again be oaken up with the War Office.    .000.  wagons are annually hauled in&quot; and out of this depot  unnecessarily,
and this &quot;burden imposed upon the Railways d^es not appearto have &quot;been taken into consideration either by theShipping Controller or the     Office. .       The question of the removal of the other depots will betaken up.       In the course of the evidence which, was given beforeus it transpired that there Yvas urgent need for the doublingof a section of ;t e Caledonian Railwayj 2 miles in length,between Carlisle un5. Gretna.;   The cost would be about 60,000 and there seemed little likelihood of any progressbeing made beca/use of a dispute between the Ministry ofMunitions and the Caledonian Railway as to whether thewidened section should be taken over by the CaledonianRailway at post-war or pre-war prices.  . At the request ofthe Ministry of Munitions we arranged for a Conference atGretna to discuss this question with Mr. West, the LondonGoods Superintendent of the South lastera and ChathamRailway.   It seemed fairly clear that negotiations as topayment would in all probability be interminable, and asall parties &quot;srero agreed s to the necessity of the widening,it was arranged with the Ministry of Munitions for the work tobe put in hand at once, leaving till a later stage thesettlement as to the cost.   Certain difficulties arose whichnecessitated consultation with the Railway Executive Committee/;but the work, is now in hand. .       Having proceeded so far with our investigations it seemedclear to r.a that it would be unprofitable to take further evidenceand that what .t:asv.now required was an actual inspection of -conditions at: ports: in the ?,ight of the general conclusionswhich we had reaped from the evidence^ liad already taken.It was impossible for the members of our Committee themselvesto spare the time for this, and we agreed to ask to act as avisiting Sub-Committee, Mr. Lyster of Messrs. Sir John WolfeBarry, Lyster &amp; Partners, late Engineer-in-Chief and no^Consultant Engineer of the Mersey Docks &amp; Harbour Board.Mr. West; London Goods Superintendent of the South Eastern &amp;Chatham Railway; Mr. Jardine, General Manager of the Port ofGreenock.. and Mr. Roberts, General Manager of the Port of Leith.All these gentlemenrvery kindly consented to act and we should liketo express our appreciation of the unsparing way in 7/hich theyhave devoted to the work of inspection - at times in veryinclement weather - their time, skill, and energy, often, wefear, with a good deal of personal inconvenience.       Copies of their reports are attached to this Report as anappendix, with notes showing what steps have already beentaken as a result of their recommendations.   All the questionsraised we hope to be able to pursue.       The system of allocating cargoes to ships from Whitehallseems to us to  require investigation.   Mr. LysterV Sub-Committeewere particularly struck at Bristol with the difficulties anddelays which arise  owing to the system of allocating cargoesfor Salonica. ;  The paragraph of their&apos;report dealing with this :question is worded  as follows;-.        &quot;^t transpired that wagons were being frequentlyheld up  under load here for excessive periods owing:partly  to the irregular arrival of ships and partlythrough  the sudden  alteration of loading instructionsreceived from the War Office.   It was represented thatthere had been  occasions when a ship was lying at
    the Quay with  several hundred tons  of munitions  waiting    alongside,  hut instructions were received not to load  as  the    space was required  for  other  traffic;    It was also repre-    sented  that the loading instructions were often  wrong,    material  proper for  deck loads being allocated for holds    or  vice versa, and no regard was sometimes paid  to whether    a ship was  fitted with  stanchions or not, or  in  general to    the suitability of ship for the cargo allocated.   The    senior partner of the  Chief local Firm of Stevedores referred    to  the anomaly of loading cargo into an unsuitable ship    when a suitable ship  i?as berthed nearby and had room.    There have also been  cases inhere vessels hali&apos; loaded sre    sent from Avonmouth  to Cardiff to take on heavy cargo    which cannot be loaded at Avonmouth and are then brought    back to complete their cargo.         It was represented to us that a system of allocation    from Whitehall to destination via Port only, instead of    via Port and a specific ship would result in an improvement    and we recommend that steps should be taken to decentralise    the  control of transports to this extent.   It seems clear    to us that no one except officers on the spot is able    satisfactorily to  allocate cargo  among the various  ships    which they have to load.         We also  suggest that Mr,IllingworthIs Committee   might care to  examine how far the  instructions of the ^ar   Office and the Admiralty far this work  are  co-ordinated.   It was represented to us that there  was,  generally  speaking,   very little co-ordination&quot;.We propose  to take up the matter with the  Department concerned.The section of Mr Oyster*s  bub-CommitteeTs  reports,  to whichwe wish to  draw the  special  attention of  the  War  Cabinet is tothe following effect        *&amp;enerally speaking,  the main obstacle  to  the best use   of ports in the national  interest  has  been a failure  to   abandon  practices and methods whioh however  suitable  to   times  of peace, do not meet  the requirements of present&apos;   conditions.    This is the  inevitable result  of  a  system based   on local and competitive  outlook,  naturally  involving a   want of  appreciation  of  the  needs  of a national transit   system.         Our. reports on  the  different  ports visited show  that   considerable  re-arrangement  of working methods  is   necessary in order to place  things  on  a more satisfactory   basis.         In addition, it will be necessary to provide&apos;;some   machinery for  ensuring that  the changes in practice are   maintained.         For this purpose we recommend that a Central Committee   should be established or maintained with a representative   in each port who  should report at regular intervals.    The   Committee^ function would be to keep  In touch with the   general  situation as affecting the transit system of the   country and to provide a means of guidance for  local   administration in matters which affect the national Interest.        Co-ordination Committees or &quot;Conferences&quot; should be   set up in the  different ports - if they are not already in   being -and the Cei*tral  Committees representatives should   be members of these bodies.
          We are confident that the weak spots in the various       administrations to which Ve have referred in our       detailed report emphasized the need, of such a system as       we suggest.&quot;&apos;       There was, so far as we can see, no authority in existencewhich has the power of effecting co-ordination between theShipping Controller, the&apos; Port &amp; Transit Executive Committee,the Railway Executive Committee and other Authorities whose :outlook is naturally,&apos; if not necessarily, often conflicting,hut since our Committee has been sitting there has beenestablished a weekly &quot;conference- of--representatives of all theDepartments concerned which should have good results and ifit is effective should go far to meet Mr. Lyster^srecommendation.       We do not propose to discuss Mr. Lyste^s reports indetail.   They are drawn up shortly and clearly and we do notthink they can be&apos; ixaproved, ; : We should 1 ike, however, to drawparticular attention to Eases at three ports showing how Atpresent one interest is able to go its own way unhindered tothe detriment and in spite of the protests of the other,perhaps more important, interests concerned.       At Glasgow there is no electric lighting in the shedswhich at night are in semi-darkness.   The Clyde Harbour Trustfor many years have been considering whether sometMng  \should not be done to effect an improvement, so far without-result.   The only obstacle seems to be the cost of installationand lack of appreciation of the need.   Doubtless the ClydeTrust themselves would derive no immediate increase of revenuefrom the installation of electric light, but the extra costand loss doe to comparative inefficiency generally of nightwork owing to defective lighting must by now represent a sumgreater by many times than the cost of installation would be.This extra ^cet does not obviously directly affect the ClydeTrust revenues though the inefficiency of work done probablydoes , but undoubtedly it does so indirectly and the port isrendered less effective as a gateway;for the necessities ofexistence and the interests of the nation have suffered forwant of a central authority not acting in any particularinterest which could bring pressure to bear in the proper -quarter%   There are far more serious questions at Glasgowsuch as the general control of use of labour, the installationof modern apparatus etc, which need the attention of acentral co-ordinating Authority, but we have here calledattention to the comparatively small matter of electriclighting, where the effect of inaction is Indisputable, theremedy obvious and easy, and the position clear cut generally,because it is symptomatic of the present management of thePort of Glasgow       We regret having to comment so adversely on themanagement. :&apos;; The Clyde Trust have in the past*,, in largeundertakings involving an expenditure perhaps&apos;of millions,shown initiative, and no tendency to undue economy:  hut insmaller matters,&apos;1 which nevertheless are important if thework of the port is to be made properly efficient, they haveadopted a parsimpnius and procrastinating policy which wefear has by now become an ineradicable habit. :  It isdepressing to hear of an important modern Port almostunprovided with modern apparatus,- with rails laid down butalmost completely disused and with no attempt to exercisecontrol over entrances, and where extensive-&quot;and daily thefts
 are  accepted as  almost a law of nature,  There  ar*,  in our  opinion, too many Trustees to  form a really satisfactory Board,  and those Members of the Board  and: the off ioials who take the  controlling share in the  work have/..wo fear,  proved themselves incapable of disassociating thomselves  from traditional practice to anything like  the extent tfhich present conditions require.  Our first idea was to: recommend that the control of the  Port of Glasgow  should  be vested  at ohoe in a modern and efficient management  but on recohsidera-bion  we are inclined to think that the  situation might be  met by  asking the present management to accept the help of two or three exports to be nominated by our  Committee making  it plain  thatrefusal on their  part or failure to oo-oporate with  their new colleagues will leave the Govornment no alternative but to adopt the more drastic al tor native.  vVe should like to nominate Mr. Lobnitz and Mr.  Luke  of the  Ministry of Munitions  and Mr. Jardino of Greenock, all of whom have done excellent, work  on  tho Clyde and  are well known at Glasgow.,  In making this  recommendation we have imrticularly in mind the difficult labour  position in Glasgow and the  enhanced importance of West Coast  Ports which with the  entry of the U.S.A. into  the  war is becoming still more marked.      At Manchester, we desire to draw  special notice to a complicated situation^ mainly the  relations batwodn  the Manchester Ship  Canal^^ho Trafford Park Company and the Railway Oorapanlos - The lond^n and Iforth  postern,  tho Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire, aad -she Cheshire.Linos. These five interests with,  of course, the Shipowners, form.the  most important elements in the Port of  Manchester, and  unless  they co-operate or only compote short of a  point where  the efficiency of the Port begins to be impaired the -National interest  suffers.                                            three      The  interchange of traffic between the      interests is regulated by agreements as to the  meaning of anich there  are long standing1 disputes which have  not  yet been  settled by litigation or otherwise.      The  position is fully desoribed In the report of Mr,  Dyste^s Sub-Committee and we  do not think  it  is necessary for  us  to recapitulate it.  The most pressing need Is for more siding  accommodation for the interchange of traffic,  and  we have suggested arbitration, the various interests  to contribute equally to the cost of any work regarded as immediately necessary without prejudice to any claim for refundment they may  subsequently wish to m&amp;ke. -      &quot;O hope to  be ablo to arrange a settlement on this basis and  there are signs that we will do so.   We refer to  the matter  at this length only to emphasize our point  that there was  no  one disinterested authority in  a position to  bring any pressure  to bear upon the various  interests at  *$an$hester! to secure co-operation, -v^-v-i&apos;      An interesting case to which  wo bare already  drawn the attention of the iter Cabinet has arisen in the  Port  of londoa, wnere the Shipping Controller, to  our  mind arbitrarily, has appropriated for R.iu Transport work now done and well done  at the  South west India Docks, certain deep water  berths  Albert Dock.  Vessels  using the berths are small and  of  shallow draught and are  easily losd-ic-  with the rather  old-fashioned, but, for  this work, adequate facilities at the  South 7,&apos;est  India
        Docks.    We should raise no particular objection to theuse for this work occasionally of the berths in question at theAlbert Dock, but we consider that absolute appropriation   fcH*-advised.        We have taken the matter up with the Shipping Controllerand we hope that a settlement can be effected., but had ourCommittee not-been in existence it is difficult:to see towhom this ta^k of settlement could have been entrusted.   TheShipping Controller had appropriated the berths in spite ofprotests from the representatives in the Port of London ofthe Y/ar Office, the Ministry of Munitions, the Port of LondonAuthority^ and the Railway Companies concerned.   The Port andTransit Executive Committee, had they been called in would havebeenesposed to a suspicion of bias in favour of the ShippingController or the Port, the Railway Executive Committee wouldhave been exposed to a similar suspicion of bias towards theRailways.   The Ministry of Munitions, the War Office and theAdmiralty, in our opinion, should not be asked to interveneuhless there is absolutely no other alternative available,in a matter where the general commercial efficiency of aport is concerned.        We recommend that our Committee be kept in being at leastfor the duration of war, with power to appoint if necessaryrepresentatives in potts or elsewhere to act as its eyes andears, unless existing-Departments can supply/liirough theirrepresentatives the information we nee&amp;:  that it should haveno strictly executive functions but that its raison d&apos;etre shouldbe the maintenance of an enlightened co-operation between thevarious interests concerned in the transit system of the countrywith bright to refer to the War Cabinet for settlementany case where want of co-operation between any two or moreinterests is prejudicial to the national interests and whereagreement cannot otherwise be secured.   We do not thinkit would be necessary often to exercise this right ofreference.   It has been pointed out to Us that thedisappearance of the stimulus of competition must involvea certain risk of lessened eagerness to undertake workas We21 as other difficulties, and that on this groundalone the existenoe of such a Committee as ours seems tobe desirable.      v.--&apos;:        A representative of our Committee in a port should wethink ex officio&apos;have the right to be present at meetingsof the local &quot;Co-ordination Committee&quot; or &quot;Conference&quot;  and itshould be his duty to report to us regularly how the flowover the transit system of the country was being maintainedso far as it came within his knowledge.        Wo think that it would also be useful if arrangementscould be made for the return to our Committee during the warof the actual time taken to turn round ships as comparedwith the normal particulars being given of the time ofarrival, commencement and completion of unloading, and timeof departure so that cases of unusual delay may thus bebrought under special notice and any very rapid or goodwork may be praised as it deserves.        In this connexion we should like to emphasize theimportance of having in all ports a regular &quot;Conference&quot; ofall  interests.   Co-ordination Committees strictlyspeaking  are bodies composed of &quot;important&quot; members and      f!inction is primarily to co-ordinate the requirements01 ths War Office and the Admiralty and the need3 of the*ort.   The Co-ordination Committee at Bristol is a case
in ttoint.  Tho Chairman - ex officio as Chairman of the DocksCommittee of the Corporation - is Aldsrman Twiggs, aperambulator manufacturer, a gentleman to whom our Sub-Committee are indebted for much consideration and.verygenerous1 hospitality:  his main, interest however is plainlyand not unnaturally.: the i prosperity of the Merchants of Bristoland he has no., expert knowledge of traffic management.  Onthis Committee the Railways have no representative-.  &apos;&quot;0 haveno objection to such a Committee remaining in being but wethink tho real advisory function should be vested in aworking, body, .a &apos;iConferance&quot;. suoh as exists at Liverpoolwhich- should moot wbolcly and should, be composed of those  whooarry out the actual work of. the port or use its facilitieslargely.&apos;:;::    &apos; &apos;              :.&quot;&apos;-;     The members of.Mr. Lyster1s Sub-Committee have verygenerously consented to give ^us all the help in their power ;if our Committee, continues in being and we are &quot;confident  that.with this valuable, as si stance we could do much, if ourposition is regularised as we suggest, not in the way of,carrying out any drastic and far-reaching reforms, which  aremore properly the concern of-departments already in. being,but by pointing outthe need-hers.and there,for minor reformsand improvements to be put into.effect, the effect of whichin the aggregate we believe would, be considorablo;     In support of this view wo may mention that since thevisits of our Sub-Committee -wo have heard&quot; unofficielly fromat least two ports, London and Liverpool, that excellentresults -have been produced&apos;not so much by the actualinvestigations&apos; but by the. spirit.in which they were carriedout.  In some cases for the&apos;first: time working representativesof various interests met together.on a friendly footing andthere is every prospect, that this-simple/effectiveprocedure will become the rule..&apos; -       and.     Mr, Lyster and the members of his Subcommittee haverendered valuable b-Up in the preparation of this report.Th y agree with the recommendations we have made and withthe general terms of the report so far as these are coveredby the scope of their investigation.  7                       (Signed)   ARTHUR H.
