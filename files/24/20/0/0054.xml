STRICTLY  PRIVATE  AND  CONFIDENTIAL.?c                 THE   SUBMARINE   MENACE.    i.  The appalling wastage of.the British Mercantile Marine during the last 5months through War Losses, and the continuing delay in the replacement of thoselosses by new building,  have rendered imperative the immediate adoption  of thepolicy of limiting sailings through the danger areas to the number for which a fairmeasure of protection can be guaranteed, by the Admiralty.    2.  To secure such measure of protection : -   -    FIRST.  There must be provided reasonable safety throughout the main approach   *     routes,    : &apos;                                   -               ;,     ;:v  (A) From the entrance of the Channel to London.         (B) From Fastnet to Liverpool or Bristol Channel Ports.          (c) From, Tory Island to Liverpool or Glasgow-     -&apos;--&apos;&quot;&apos;-. (D) From London up the East Coast.    SECOND-All vessels having an effective ocean-going speed of less than 14 knots        must be provided, by means of an adequate escort or otherwise, with a fair    :.&apos;measure of protection until clear of the danger areas.  -/    THIRD.-Vessels having an effective ocean-going speed of 14 knots and upwards    -   must be provided with a gun forward as well as aft.    3.  In travelling in convoy, vessels having a speed of less than 14 knots should begrouped according to speeds eg., above and below 11 knots.    4.  Vessels having an effective ocean-going speed of 14 knots and upwards canproceed, when clear of the main approach routes, with a fair measure of safety, withoutescort or other protection, provided :-   -  (A) They carry a gun both fore and aft.    -(B)&apos; Concentration at rendezvous, or in areas, or in lanes, which are not fully        protected be avoided.     (c) The route  to be followed through the danger areas be prescribed by the        Admiralty for each ship on each voyage.         .     (D) The Master be kept full informed by the Admiralty by wireless of the con-        ditions as he approaches and is passing through the danger areas.  - Instruc-       - lions as.to route to be.given without requiring the  Master to report by   .-&apos;;..   wireless his approach.      (c) The Master be given a wide discretion to vary the prescribed route should in-          his opinion special occasion arise.  .  5-  The following general questions should be taken into consideration :--   . FIRST.  The order to make the land at daybreak to be  reconsidered, having        regard to the greater distances the submarines are now operating from the        . coast, and in any amended order regard be had to the speed of the individual        vessel on the particular voyage so that the greatest possible advantage may         be taken of the night for passing through the area of the greatest danger.
I    I   llli^-SECOND.   The receiving of wireless messages by war ships.  It is suggested that    war ships engaged in the protection of commerce should work their wireless    as a general rule on the commercial wave-and only at intervals on the war -   wave, v -        -THIRD. What can be done to place the relations between the  Officers of the    Royal Navy and of the Merchant Service on a better footing ?  Much has    been done by the establishment of the Chatham Course.    Greater facilities    should be given for such training.  More could be done if the risks the men    of the Merchant Service are facing, voyage in and voyage out, often with    vessels of  low speed and.  with guns which arc hopeless^ outranged, wore;    more fully recognised.  .FOURTH.   Whether, within the limits of prudence, many more guns and men    cannot be better employed on the Merchant ships sailing without escort    than on the war ships.  :o                                  V; -FIFTH.  What can be done to bring about closer working between the Admiralty .   and the Liner Organisations with a view to such Organisations being used    to secure closer and more intelligent observance.of the Admiralty&apos;s orders    and instructions, and to test the efficacy of the steps taken by the Admiralty    to protect commerce ?  The losses resulting from the experiments that have    been tried during the last 5 months, and which experiments arc now being    abandoned, must not be repeated.ijth July, 1917.10
