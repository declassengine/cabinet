War Cabinet.                  The  situation  a?  regards horses  for  the  Army.                  Memorandum by the  Secretary of  State  for  War.                       The  War Cabinet  may like to know  the  horse             situation generally in the various theatres and what we  have             been able to do  in  order to carry out their instructions for             the reduction  of horses  in Army charge, and also as  regards             reduction in Bhipping  required  for their  transport,                       Formerly  a considerable number  of ships were set             apart for the  carriage from N,America of  horses only,  this             has now been completely stopped and only  such horses are             sent as can be shipped after the vessels  have been  fully             loaded  with grain or other stores.                       Recently  an  attempt to obtain horses  by impressment,             at the  request of the  Food Control Committee, has proved             that there is  practically  no available reserve  of light             draught horses suitable  for military  purposes in civil hands             in Great  Britain, while  the heavy draught horses are needed             for the extended cultivation of the United  Kingdom;   it  is             therefore essential to import draught horses  from, abroad and             IU America is  our only suitable source of supply, France,                The  animal establishments in France are kept             constantly under review and reductions amounting to  20,000             have already been effected since 1st  January  19l6.    A             further reduction of 26,000 horses has recently been arranged             for, including the  dismounting  of a number  of cavalry             regiments,   A proportion  of this latter  reduction,  namely             4,600 horses,  is dependent on their being replaced by             Mechanical Transport,United                 The  establishments of units in  United KingdomKingdom.      have been reduced by over  16,000 horses out of  a total of             118,000,  excluding  those under  Veterinary treatment.   It             is net  advisable to reduce these further  as certain  units             preparing for  service  overseas  require their  full complement             of horses,  also  horses are necessary  for  all  training             establishments,  many of  which combine the work  of training             men and also conditioning  horses for  overseas,  which form             the second reserve  of  animals, Egypt&apos;                Egypt  has sufficient  animals in Depots, and due             from Salonika  and France (on reduction of Cavalry) to  complete             new formations and  keep  up the  whole  to the end of October.                       By that date there will be  nothing  left in the             Remount Depots,  unless meantime further shipments have been             arranged  for.                       It is  possible that further reductions  in  Salonika             establishments may  provide the  necessary  mules,  but  both             riding  and Heavy Battery horses must  be imported  from             elsewhere,  to  the number of 2,000 monthly at  the  least.                       The  fact  therefore stands out that without             shipments of horses the  operations in Palestine might  be             considerably hampered,                                                           Salonika.Q
(  Salonika.                The animals  in Salonika have been largely reduced   *-      by transfer of troops  to Egypt  and by reduction of the                remainder  from a Pack  to a Wheeled basis.                          Under present  conditions of comparative                inactivity this detachment has  enough animals  in hand to                last  till  the end  of October.                          Should it be required to undertake any active                operations,  further shipments are necessary.                          Should Troops  bo transferred to  other theatres -                where the  establishments are on a lower scale,  mules will                become surplus and available to upkeep Egypt.  Mesopotamia.             The Force in Mesopotamia is supplied with                animals by the Indian  Government which imports chiefly                from Australia and South America,  both southern hemisphere                countries,  whose animals need special acclimatization to                resist the changed seasons.  -                          It is therefore necessary for them to look well             ,   ahead and  import their animals  a year in advance to be                acclimatised in India  before issue.                          The rate of  wastage which India allows for is                high, namely, 6c$  per  annum for Artillery and  120?* per                annum for  Cavalry  horses, and they have asked  the  India                Office to  arrange  for  the import of  23,500 horses from                Australia,  4,000 mules from China and o,000 mules  from                South America.  India&apos;s equine resources  have always been                United-, and are now dried up,  Mesopotamia is  a long way               . off,  and it seems  therefore  unwise to reduce the con-                siderable  demands  of the General Officer Commanding-in-                Chief in India.                          Further  the  period of acclimatization in India                gives us a potential reserve of horses,  which  can  be made              -  use of in  exceptional  emergency either in  Mesopotamia  or                even in Egypt, for by  using  these animals  for  her  own                troops during the  later  period  of their preparation, India                could release a portion  of her  own fit horses  for  duty                elsewhere.East Africa.               The loss of  horses in East  Africa has                inevitably been high owing to local conditions.                          The Troops there are  dependent entirely  on the                resources  of the Union of South Africa,  which  are  sufficient                for their  needs.                            DERBY.24th July,  1917.
