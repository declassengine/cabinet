umi.vSECRET.Intelligence Bureau,   Department of Information.            BWP/009.                Weekly Report on Poland.  IX.                     (13th July. 1917.)     Developments in Warsaw.     That the Right and the Centre, the organisation of the late.pro-Russian conservatives and that of the pro-Austrian con-servatives and &quot;moderates&quot; have drawn together, and that theradical-socialist  Left has passed into sharp opposition to thisnew alliance and its conciliatory policy with regard to theCentral Powers, is by now obvious.   The Joint Committee consistingof 14 members of the Council of State and 10 members invited fromoutside, which is to draw up a scheme for organising the Polishgovernment, met on June 19.   Proposals were brought before itfor reorganising the Council of State and raising its membershipfrom 25 to 40, thus making it possible for^late pro-Russians,  whohad originally refused to enter the Council, to join it; forcreating the post of &quot;a Polish Minister of State&quot; - a Premier;  ofa Cabinet Council; of Ministries for the branches of public ad-ministration which the occupying Powers have promised to hand  overto the Poles (Justice, Education, Interior,  Labour,  Finance -  thislast within narrow limits) and of Departments for branches in  whichthey are not promised freedom of action (Army and Foreign Affairs).According to an Amsterdam wire dated July 10 and published inThe Times of July 12 a scheme of that kind has been  accepted by theCouncil of State.   It is further stated that the re-organised.Council of State is to prepare &quot;regulations  relating to &quot;toe regencyand an electoral law for the Diet&quot;.    It seems however  advisableto withhold judgment until full information  is received fromPoland; the wires on Polish affairs published inline  British Press
do not afford a sufficient  guide for judging fully of the  signifi-cance and nature of events.     Fuller information which we have to hand does not extendbeyond the first days of July.    Of the developments  prior tothat date these are the out standing facts:-     (1)   The Leftj  composed of radicals and socialists,  put     forward at the meeting  of June 19 the following  three demands:     (a)  That the decisions of the Joint Committee should be     binding on the Council  of State.;     (b)  That the Left should receive on the Committee five     more seats which,  if granted,  would have given them one-third  ..v  of the votes of the Committee.     (c)   &quot;That the Bcheme  for organising the Polish government     should not he limited  to the province allowed to it in the     answer of the Central Powers,  but should include the  entire     minimum demanded by the Polish nation;  on this basis  it  would     be possible to start building  the Polish State in conjunction     with the occupying Powers.&quot;     The first requirement was on the way to be  solved by  meansof a compromise, but when the second demand  was  refused therepresentatives of the Left    pronpon- withdrew from the JointCommittee.     It is not clear whether their  third demand  was discussed beforthey left the Committee,  but it is  obvious that  it  ran counterto the policy of the two other groups.   The Joint  Committee  wasformed to prepare proposals  based on the answer  of the CentralPowers.   What the Left demanded was that the terms of that answershould be ignored and that the Joint Committee should work pre-sumably on the basis of the  demands made by  the  Council of State onMay 1 including the formation of a  complete  Polish government andpractical?^ excluding all German or Austrian authority in Polish
     As  a  consequence of the v/itndrawal from the Joint Committee only one member of the Left (Sliwinski) has withdraw also from the Council  of State; the other&quot;8; including Pilsudski, remain, on it, and the  &quot;breach between the Left and the other groups must not therefore  he as yet treated as final.   The reactionary bloc in the Council has every reason to try to avoid such a breach.   Should the Left leave the Council, the latter would be at the mercy of the Central  Powers and would consequently count far very little; it is the Left only which has the confidence of revolutionary Russia and of the sincere Polish Democrats in Russia, and it is primarily in Russia that the Polish Council of State finds its much-needed moral support  from abroad.   But these circles in Russia have no use either for the quondam friends of the quondam Tsar, or for the; Habsburgites.-             -     (2)   The Joint Committee continued its sittings after the withdrawal of the Left.   According to newspaper reports it decided to appoint a Polish Premier and to offer this post to Count Adam Tarnowski, the late AuBtro-Eungarian minister at Sofia and ambassador at Washington; further to appoint a committee consisting of three members  who, together with some delegates of the Council of State, are to re-organise that Council.   These three men are to be Arch- bishop Kakowski, Prince Z. Lubomirski and the Chairman of the present  Council of State (the so-called Crown liarshal) H. de iTiemojowski.  The choice made for the Premiership and for the &quot;Committee of Three&quot; fully bears out the opinion expressed in our report of  June 27 that the moving spirits in the reconciliation of the pro-Austrian and a branch of the late pro-Russian conservatives were Prince Z. Lubomir ski, Count Adam Tarnov/ski and Archbishop Kakowski.      Lt is impossible to make out what the attitude of the national Democrat party machine at V/arsaw is with regard to this new political groupment.   Practically all the prominent men
ftave  left that party machine, and its following in- tie. country seems to have dwindled down to an extent which renders it practically- insignificant: for all we know, that party may possibly be a mustard seed, but certainly it is not a tree at present.      (i)   It seems that the candidature of Count Adam Tarnov/ski to the Polish Premiership, which has of course the warmest support of Austria, has been vetoed by the Germans and that in consequence it will have to be v/ithdrawn.      The Congress of the Polish Soldiers1 Delegates at Petrograd.      At the Congress which met on June 8, three groups were formed described as the Right, the Centre and the Left.   The Right, under the leadership of the National Democrats, was in favour of forming the Polish soldiers serving with the Russian Army into a separate Polish army, the Left, under the leadership of the Polish Democrats, opposed this scheme as injurious both to the cause of the Russian revolution and to the conduct of a Polish national policy.   The Centre took up an intermediary attitude and favoured the gathering of the Polish soldiers into a special army unit, but apparently v/ithout any political purpose.   At the sitting of June 15 a letter was read out from M. Kerensky containing a strong appeal to the Poles not to waaken the organisation of the Russian army and &quot;not to break the solidarity of that army&quot;, but to do their duty as citizens &quot;within the ranks of the Russian revolutionary army just as they have done hitherto&quot;.      The Right seems to have felt its position to be weak and there- fore  in order to carry the essential point of its programme,  came forward with a comparatively mild and moderate resolution demanding without political flourish the immediate creation of &quot;a Polish armed force out of the Poles- serving in the Russian army&quot;.   The motion of the Centre demanded merely their formation into &quot;a separate military unit according to a scheme which should be worked out by the Russian military authorities together with a Polish Army  Council
chosen by the Congress&quot;.   The Left daclared.-it ^necessary --&quot;to...subordinate themselves entirely to the will of Polaal and of itslegitimate government which, at the present moment, is the Provision--:al Council of State&quot;.   It proposed that the Congress should notpronounce on the questi0.1 of the army or of Polish military units.     The motion of the Left having been rejected, it declared thatno congress, either military or civilian, consisting of Polishemigrants in Russia can decide the question of forming a Polisharmy, because they are only a small part of the Polish nation andought to subordinate themselves to its will; and that the questionof forming Polish units within the &quot;Russian army is an internalproblem of the Russian Ministry of tfar v/hich has appointed,a-specialconmittee  to deliberate on it, and that this problem cannot bedecided by the Congress.  This declaration was signed &quot;by 90 membersof the Left, 11 of its members having already previously left theCongress, which they considered excessively militarist in spirit.  !2h.ualmost a third of the Congress has withdrawn from the  further--meetings-     In a  way,  after H.  Kerensky^ letter,  the most  striking incident/at the Congress was the  fact that  on  June 19 the Congress expresseditB confidence in the Council of State  in  tfarsaw and  declared that&quot;all independent  policy  conducted  outside Poland in  the name of thePolish nation is  harmful to the cause of Polish independence,  andthat Polish policy can be conducted only from Poland&quot;; and that &quot;aPolish army can be created abroad  only with the consent  of theauthorities at home which are acknowledged  by the  nation&quot;.     In other words,  the Congress  has acknowledged the authority  ofthe Polish government in Warsaw which the  national Democratshave hitherto decidedly  opposed and disputed,  and  has condemned theidea of an independent Polish policy  or  of  a Provisional Polishgovernment abroad.    The result  of the Congress can therefore be                     politicaldescribed  as a crushing/defeat  of  the National Democrats  .  Asfar as the formation  of  a Polish Army is  concerned these have
rsuffered no less a defeat.    ILven the.;xesolutljwxjoarr-:ted &quot;by therump Congr-eas. whichi.deman&amp;3-&apos;Xh&amp; creation of the Polish, armed force,adds the formula  of the Centre which says that this should bedene in an understanding with the Russian military author it ies.If the consent both of Kersnsky and of &quot;the authorities at home&quot;is recuired for creating ,!ths national Pclisli Amy&quot; in Russiathere does not seem to be much chance of its materialising.mi.
