Downing Street,  .                                            17th July, 1917.Dear Hankey,         With reference to Minute if o. 5 of the Minutes of theMeeting of the War Cabinet held on 2nd.July on the subjectof honours for tho Mercantile ifexine, Mr.long desires ne tosend you the enclosed copy of a letter which he has addressedto Sir Albert Stanley,                          Yours sincerely,                            (Signed)  H. P. Batterbee.(ii)             Copy of. lettey grom the Secretary of State             for the Colonies to the Brosideut. Bocrd of Trade.                                         Downing Street,                     .. \&quot;                  .  17th July, 1917, .Ify, dear Stanley, .   . ,         I have taken time to consider carefully the memoran-dum of the 20th June which you submitted to the Cabinet onthe subject&quot; ef Honours for representatives  of the MercantileMarine.   -         The War Cabinet considered your proposals on the2nd Jaly without previous reference to me,  and in my absence.I em therefore unaware of the rocsons which led them to giveapproval to y our suggestion,  but -1 /observe  from theirResolution oh the sub ject that their! approval was nsub Jectto the agreement of the  Secretary of Stfcte  for the Colonies&quot;.9 ^  0446
      It probably  escaped  the notice both of the  Cabinetand  of yourself, that  this  is a natter  effecting  theStatutes of the Order  of St.Miehael and St.George,  andthat the power of  modifying those Statutes is vestedby them in His Majesty as.the Sovereign of the Order.If this had been present to the mind of the  Cabinet, I ....think they would have  shared my opinion that it was notdesirable that such a  matter should cone up  for decisionIn the Cabinet until It had provibusly  been  ascertainedthrough me-, as the Minister responsible,  what His Majesty^views are likely to be.        &quot; v-      The only portion of ybur memorandum with which I amconcerned is that which suggests that a section of  theOrder of St.Michael and St.George should be  permanentlyallocated to the Mercantile Marine.1   I yield to no-bnein my admiration of the war work performed by them,  and Ishould be very glad to know that this received appropriaterecognition from the Admiralty.;; ;Your proposals arey  however,intended to have effect as a post-war measure, and  I wouldpoint out that the King has Just instituted  an Order whichwould seem to be expressly designed for rewarding theservices to which you allude.   I regret to  say that I.canfind no sufficient reason for agreeing to your proposal asregards the St.Michael and St.George.    That Order wasfounded - as its Statutes expressly state -  for the purposeof rewarding services in and for-the Dominions and Colonies,reserved for foreign service).   Without troubling you withthe detailed considerations on which I found my opinion, Iam satisfied that the alteration which you desire woulddestroy the distinctive character of the Order;  would bestrongly resented by those affected;  and would lead toadministrative difficulties.  I I: may also add that as, youare aware, the Order has been distributed to many high officersamong our Allies, and I am strongly of opinion that the coursewhich you propose  -would very possibly give rise to anembarrassing situation.      I have not arrived at this conclusion without fullconsideration, and without making enquiry in quarterscompetent to advise me;  and,  On all the grounds which Ihave stated, I have decided that\I cannot accept theproposal which you have made.    i have come to this decisionwith the less regret inasmuch as you now have an opportunityof putting forward a claim, to Which I imagine no exceptioncould be taken,  for the recognition of the Mercantile Marinein the new Order of the British  Imp ire.      I am communicating e copy  of this  letter to the WarCabinet.(with theSincerely yours,-(Signed)   W.H.D0IIG.
