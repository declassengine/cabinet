10.*?-   35MOST SECRET G.T.1408            WAR CABINETFor the Information of the War Cabinet.Prom the First Sea Lord.DESTROYER SITUATION      At the meeting of the War Cabinet yesterday and during thediscussion on the question of shipping losses, the Prime Ministerdirected the Admiralty to consider the question of a possiblere-distribution of the Destroyer Flotillas in Home Wafers with aview to increasing the number of Destroyers available for convoywork during the Summer months at the cost of other services whichmight at the moment be considered of less importance.      The question has accordingly been closelyexamined.   Thefacts are these      The whole of the 212 modern ana 76 old British Destroyers in*Home Waters at the present time are engaged solely on some formof trade protection,  with the exception of a portion of the 100Destroyers allocated to the Grand Fleet,  some of  the 24 belongingto the Harwich Force,  the 25 modern Destroyers of the DoverFlotilla, and 4 minelaying Destroyers whose function of minelayingagainst submarines is, by reason of its intended  destruction ofsubmarines,  a measure of trade  protection.    The  17  BritishFlotilla Leaders are  not included in this total,  as  they are toolarge and vulnerable  to submarine  attack to be used,for mercantileconvoy work.    2 Destroyers engaged in asxperimental  work are alsonot included,  as they cannot be spared from this  duty.      A great  many of the Destroyers  engaged in trade protectionare working in the English Channel escorting transports,  hospitalships, store  and ammunition ships,  etc,  across the  Channel, andas the number so employed is always insufficient  and the  responsiblenaval officers are constantly representing  the necessity for anincrease, it  is obvious that none  can be  taken from  this  sourcefor convoy work elsewhere.    The same  remark applies  to  theIjgi Smapatr01  SHI -gaged on the M Coast, aaa we are
therefore driven to considering the possibility of obtaining theadditional Destroyers required from the three remaining sources.viz., the Dover Force, the Harwich Force or the Grand Fleet.It may be said at once that the&quot;Vice-Admiral, Dover, theGommodore (T),7 and the.Commander-in-Chi ef.  Grand Fieet,  have eac^;frequently represented the inadequacy of their force for the work;;required of them.                           V;-:-&quot;.     In the case of the Dover Force, only the modern destroyers(25 in -Jio.)  are not directly engaged in escort work, i.e. tradeprotection.   The 25 modern destroyers: although not directly so-employed are the vessels upon which we depend to deter enemysubmarines from passing the Dover barrage on the surface and tosafeguard mercantile traffic from attack by enemy destroyersworking from Gstend.and  eebrugge.  They carry out these functions:by patrolling the Straits of Dover and if they were withdrawn theresults would unquestionably be immediately disastrous.     All the available destroyers of the Harwich Force areengaged:directly in the  protection of the Dutch trade at leastonce a week, and oftener if possible.  Their other duties are asfollows     About one-half of them are used to reinforce theDover Flotilla during about one-half of the month, namely,  thedark period. ;  They are also required to attack German trade work-ing between Rotterdam and German ports when German merchant shipsare running.  They are frequently used also for covering minelayimoperations in the German Bight.   They prevent attacks by Germandestroyers on our South-Eastern coasts,  on  shipping and  localtrawler patrols and rainesweepings, or they  counter attack,  and itis the only force which we have to attack the German light forcesworking from Gstend and Zeebrugge when they come out,  unless theyenter the Straits of Dover.  It is,  therefore,  quite impossibleto reduce this force, which normally consists of 16 to 18destroyers fit. for service.     Consider now the Grand Fleet destroyers.   The total number  ofdestroyers allocated to  the Grand Fleet  is  100.   At 6a.m.  onThursday the 12th July,  which is the date of the  latest  return
A  from the Grand Fleet, these destroyers were employed as follows:&apos;     Directly on trade protection.         Protecting trade between Aberdeen and the North . . .   4.         protecting the Scandinavian trade . * * . . ......   7*         Protecting trade passing the&quot;test Coast of the*                   Shetlands  ......... ........   2.         Protecting trade on the North Coast of Ireland and                    the South-West Coast of Ireland  .....  11         Escorting Oilers ... ....... ... . . . . . *   6.         Attacking a subm. rine between Lerwick &amp; Norway                    (This submarine is reported sunk). ....   4,         Sweeping down Norwegian Coast in search of raiders. .   4.      Minelaying against  enemy submarines .  .            .  .    2.      Patrolling outside  Fleet Bases to  prevent minelaying                 and to attack submarines     .  .  .  *  .  .  .    6.      Refitting at Dockyards  &amp; Private Yards.  .  .  .  ....   17      Boiler cleaning and carrying&apos;out&apos;local&quot;refits  at                 Fleet Bases   . .......  ....  .  .   12                                                             7FThe number of destroyers  immediately available had the Grand Fleetgone to sea was 25 plus the 6 outside Fleet  Bases, or  a total of31 with 9 flotilla Leaders.   Some of the 12 Destroyers temporarilyovt of action at the Fleet Bases might also  have  been  ready intime to accompany the Fleet.    As a total of at  least  64 destroyersis required to screen the Battle Fleet and Battle Cruisers againstsubmarine attack, without counting any protection afforded toLight Cruisers, it is obvious  that we cannot  afford to  reducefurther the strength of the destroyers with  the  Grand  Fleet  withouientirely immobilising it.        It is also to be  observed that If any of the 2^ destroyers^mentioned as available were taken away from  the  Grand  Fleet  andUtilised for the protection of trade off Ireland,  it \?ould havebeen quite impossible to  maintain the number of  destroyers of theGrand Fleet which were themselves engaged in trade protection, because there would have  been none available to  relieve  them whenthey ran short of fuel or required a rest in harbour.        The conditions mentioned above may he taken  as representa-tive of the average employment of Grand  Fleet destroyers underexisting circumstances.         / 0 ,v  T   &apos; m                               (Sgd).
