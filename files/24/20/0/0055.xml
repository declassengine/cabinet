 uXiVJ.^^.&apos;---w-      - Weekly Report on France,   VII               FFW/007        July 19th.  1917.     There is little to report ahout France this week except that both public and private Information suggest that the recent wave of pessimism both in Army and Nation has passed or is rapidly passing away.  Pocsibly the principle cause of this is that optimism and pessimism are largely an affair of action and reaction, and that the pendulum has now swung away again from pessimism.   Other causes are of course the arrival of the Americans, the Russian Offensive and, so far as the Army  is concerned, the promises of H. Painleve as to improved conditions about leave and generally about the lot of the soldier.   The police attempts to suppress the extensive campaign of pacifist agitation among men on short leave may also be having acme effect.   The  interesting thing would bevbo find out; as one would suppose the Government might, who organised and financed a propaganda of this  sort on suoh a very large scale.   The latest re- ports say that it is by no means completely suppressed yetit still\ finds means to convey its poison into soldiers&apos; railway-carriages.    So far as the general public is concerned the improvement is probably due not only to the action ^f time which is gradually passing its sponge&quot;over the disasters of the April Offensive, but also to suoh smaller  causes as  the announcement that arrangements have been made; with the British Government which will ensure Paris enough coal for the ensuing winter.   Here too of course the American and Russian news have helped, and the successful termination of the long secret[session has reassured people against fears of any immediate political 0*isis at home.    Of this there seems to have been more danger than the public was
aware.    Well  informed private  correspondents  say that M.  Vivianinearly upset the Ministry by tendering his  resignation.    Theimmediate Cause seems  to  have been a double rebuff to  his  vanitywhich is  somewhat unduly  swollen by his oratorical campaign inAmerica.   He  desired  to  repeat his triumphs in Petrograd,  orfailing that,  among  the French  soldiers at  the front,  and,  on bothoffers  being deolined,  he gave  in his resignation.   The matterhowever has  been amicably arranged and the  danger of a crisis haspassed.    M. Ribofs Ministry will now almost  certainly last overthe recess,  which is expected to begin about August 5th.    The trial  of the journalist arrested with  a large  foreigncheque  upon  him has  not yet  begun.                                                J. C * B.
