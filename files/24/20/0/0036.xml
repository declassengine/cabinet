                                             FSW/OOVII       July .17 th,  1917.    The situation  in  Spain remains  unchanged.    The silence of the news-  pers  as  to any important event would not by itself mean much, as there s hardly  any subject of  importance,  internal or external, which is not  eluded in the formidable list  of  forbidden topics issued by the Censor hen the Constitutional Guarantees  were suspended.    But we have other OTXroes pf information.    The  British Ambassador,  though concerned at the tate of social and political  unrost  and at the shaken popularity of the ing, has  reported that the general strike threatened for July 1st came o little  or nothing  and  that  no important strike occurred except at rtagsna.   Our Consul-General at Barcelona v/rites  on July 6th that in pite of all the rumours  in circulation,  there has  &quot;during the past month een no disturbance of the peace whatever&quot;.    So the Prime Minister, hough  no  doubt a  less impartial witness,  may well  have been telling the simple truth when he  lately  said  to the representatives of the Madrid  ess that none of the alarmist  prophecies had so far been realized.    Ho  doubt the   Germans  do all they can to cause  unrestaand disturbance Not only is it their  policy everywhere to work for  or through the extreme Right and  the extreme anarchical Left - as is  of course noticeable in ;Russia  - but in Spain anarchy  would have for them a special value besides; its ordinary one of discrediting demooraoy.    The more disturbances there are the&quot; less production there  can be:   and as  whatever Spain eiports  gor-f to  the  Allies, that result is  very  well worth  buying in German eyes. For the same reason it ought to  be  clear to  Spaniards that the Allied Governments cannot desire  to fament disturbances:   though no doubt therehave been,  mischievous individuals oaring more  about international politic cal propaganda than, sboiit  the  interest of their coimtry,  who have taken &amp;H in revolutionary intrigues  in   pain.
f ........ &apos; &apos; r^SK-&quot;^.    Meanwhile  the Army though said to  be still disaffected has given no Irther open trouble.    But  it has  become known that the UiCOIs and some If the men  took a line  016 their  own in the  recent  crisis and. forwarded Itatements if their views to the Officers&apos;  Committees.    It  is evident from this hat they have no intention of being mere tools of the  Officers,  and that[n the event of political action being taken  by the Committees the ffioers would have to  consider  the Liberal or Socialistic views  which lainly have considerable influence among the rank and  file.    The Political agreement between  the officers and men  probably does not go .uch further than hostility to the  present  unreal  political system,  aridis the Army does not seem to have any  leader  of importance,  it is not ery easy for it to act.    The only other matter to note is pleasant reading.    It is the rage)f the Germans over the recent submarine  decree, exhibited in  rather3hildish fashion by their Ambassador,  Prince  Max RatiboS,  who  seems  tolave made some kind of scene at a race-course  near Madrid.   This&apos; is of500d augury and seems to show that  the Germans  expect the  decree  to  bemforced strictly enough to seriously hinder  their submarine activities.            .           -                                  J.C.B.)
