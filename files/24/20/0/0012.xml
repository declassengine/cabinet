As  bearing on the Memorandum (O.T.13ol)  by the President of the Boord  of igrioulturo ffittd Fisheries.,. I think it proper to lay before the tar  Cabinet  the following letter which I have received  from the premier  agricultural oociety in Scotland. From;                          r,   :v   The  Director  of;                 -   .   .    ^ -  . -  -...         , r The-Highland &amp;  Agricultural Society of Scotland, To&amp; :Z:&apos;--:.-;y    \  &quot; . .                7       The  Right Honourable           rRobert Munro, 2,0.,  M.P.,                Secretary  for  Scotland,         ,                     Scottish  Office,                           Whitehall,  S.l.  Sir,       Statements which  have appeared in the Press, and rumours which  are widely circulated, suggest that  very drastic steps are- contemplated for. a  reduction of  the  numbers of oattic  in this country,.;  &apos;                  -1. *           I:&apos;      &apos; &apos;     - STe have&apos;no definite  or official  information, but we  are led to believe  that it  is  proposed to  slaughter in Scotland, during the next five months, 18,OQO,cattle,  less mature  than those  which would ordinarily bo placed -on  the  market for civilian  consumption,:       The proposal is regarded  by those  who are most conversant with the cattle Reading industry as  one  fraught with serious consequences, and we accordingly venture to submit to  you  the following, observations; upon it.      We are aware that it is thought  desirable to make  the provision of. meat for the  Army  independent  of  imported supplies and we- further understand  that  neither the usual supplies  of imported foods,  nor home grown  oOreals,  will be available  for fattening cattleV   Nevertheless, we think  that the following considerations should be duly weighed before a deoision  is  arrived 1.  We are advised by those who are well informed as: to tho facts, that 18,000 additional cattle oannot be  slaughtered in Sootland during the next five months, without  taking a large proportion of animals whose dead height will he less than 48 per cent of their live weight.   The slaughter  of such animals is evidently wasteful^ since a further period of  feeding on grasB, straw and turnips,   even without concentrated feeding etuffs, would enable them to yield a much larger proportion, and a much larger total amount of be ef. ;      We call attention to  the fact that -the increase in cultivation whichtaken place may be expected to provide a  considerably ^creased amount of roots and straw,   *7hile we are aware  that extreme fattening of animals is  not  at present desirable, and indeed is not, at the moment, being widelypractised^ we venture to urge that it is eojially undesirable*o slaughter cattle  which have been very insufficientlydeveloped.   In  summer end  autumn cattle are less advanced incondition in -Scotland than  in England.
2,   *7e point out that grass is, on the whole, abundant,and that pastures would he deteriorated by the insufficientstocking which would result from a considerable prematureslaughter of store animals.3,      suggest that the additional cultivation which iscontemplated for&apos;the Harvest of 1918 ^ould be prejudicedby such a shortage of.farm yard manure as would be createdby a considerable depletion in the m^nber of cattle avail-able for feeding.    It must be kept in view that theshortage created by the slaughter of Scottish store cattlewould be additional&apos;to. that which would arise from.a similarslaughter of;Irish store cattle.     It is evident that the provisioning.of the Army withhome produced beef must eventually, whether sooner or later,entail diminution of the amount available for civilian-consumers. /It ;is.clearly,desirable to avoid any aggravationof this by wasteful slaughter, such&quot;r.s the proposal underdiscussion seems to.entail,   &apos;7e submit that it would bebetter th.&apos;-t the inevitable diminution should be partial andgradual, rather than it should be brought about eventuallyin the form of an actual failure of supplies, such as mustresult from the killing . of store cattle on a large scale inthe near future.  -It appears to.us particularly undesirablethat such a failure should occur during the period betweenKovember and February,  in which: the cattle, proposed, to beslaughtered now, would normally fall to be consumed.     Tines-0 considerations- appear to us to point to, thedesirability of a careful restriction^of civilian supplies,rather than of the proposed premature slaughter of thecattle^ which are. the raw material of future beef productionj     This would bring about a reduction of demand which wouldin. turn effect a natural restriction of the Excessively highprices now prevailing.  -     Te have not raised this question with a view to claimingany special consideration for farmers in the matter of price.&quot;7e find it necessary, however, to point out that, if cattlebe taken at the prices which are understood to be proposed,this will entail a loss to many owners,-since&quot; the cattle mquestion have been purchased, in most instances, in the openmarket at much higher prices.   &quot;7e do not deny that theseprices were unusually, high, but we think it right to pointout that, if farmers had in preceding periods been deterredfrom buying store cattle for feeding at correspondingincreases of price,  a very serious shortage of beef wouldlong ago have arisen. -  ;&apos;7e suggest that a postponement ofthe proposed slaughter, if it be ultimately, decided upon,would diminish a serious hardship. -     Those who are engaged in the cattle feeding industrybought their store - cattle.&apos; in good faith.   They had beforethem the desire of the Governmentto increase food productionganerally,,and the efforts made&apos; by yourself and the&quot;-Boardof Agriculture for Scotland to promote that end. .  Theybelieved, and were entitled to believe, that they had theapprovr-l and the support cf the Government in their effortto carry on their business.     It is understood that the ?ood Controller has in viewthe project of. fixing prices generally in accordance withcosts of production.   while it is not always possible todetermine these in agricultural^operations, the present caseoffers less difficulty than many others to such a method ofdetermining prices.         -   &apos;  ;&apos;-&apos;; - Incidentally, we observe that&apos; the proposal to fix -prices of meat for civilian consumers offers little, prcspectOx relief to the&apos;poorer consumers, whose case most meritsconsideration
 consideration, or justifies interference.   Fixed maximum prices, on any scale which could ho thought reasonable in relation to the cost of production, must inevitably be sc high as to be without effect in reducing the price of the cheaper classes of meat,.   They are even likely,  by stimulating an already excessive demand, to aggravate a shortage of supplies,  and so actually to increase the lower scales of meat prices,  or even to make it impossible for the poorer and less  favoured purchasers to obtain meat.       We have- referred,  however,  to the question  of commandeers ing supplies  at prices  involving a loss to the  producer, mainly in order to call  attention to  the serious  effect v;hieh such action is likely  to  have on future food production,  which is the most essential  interest of the  consumer.   Farmers have had before  them the  explicit  -ledge of the Prime Minister that food supplies sill  not  be  commandeered without, the cc nsent of the Boards of  Agriculture,    They have relied on that pledge and they have  believed that  the Boards  of Agriculture would not consent  to  their produce  being-  taken at  prices  below the  costs of production, and entailing  actual loss.    If  they now see supplies  commandeered at prices involving loss  to  the producer, their  confidence  cannot fail  to  be shaken,  and they may  well hesitate  to undertake the increased production  which is essential to the national safety.      therefore urge that, before any drastic step in this direction  be taken,  its effect on the  confidence of food producers should receive  the  con- sideration which so important a matter deserves.      Apart from this general effect, we  do not, in  the present instance, lay stress upon the question of  price,   S?e  chiefly desire to emphasise the necessity for dealing with the pros- pective shortage by a conservation  of existing  supplies rather than by an anticipation of *hose which will be required to meet further demands.      It has been our most careful  endoavour to have  regard in our consideration of the matter, not to the interests of aparticular olass or industry, but to the strength and safety of the nation in this crisis of its fortunes.      We venture to hope  that our arguments may receive your  consideration,  and that you may find it possible to adoptthe views which we  have  laid before you and to urge them inthe broper quarter.      I would add that my advisers do not consider that thewastage referred to will take place to the extent  anticipated.On the question of price,  the Society is on strong ground.Prices fixed for the  United Kingdom will affeot Scottish cattleprice are higher in Scotland in normal  circumstances.   I amadvised that the prices mentioned in Memorandum (G.T.1351)  areOn behalf of the Directors,      Your obedient Servants,            (Sgd*) Charles Douglas         CHAIRMAM,(Sgd.)
