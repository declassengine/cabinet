t14SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,^jfr^EKLY REPORT ON BULGARIA.  XI.^        July 16, 1917.Department of Information.DBW/011.The Stockholm Conference  and Its  Critics.     In Report No.  10 the views of two members of the &quot;Broad&quot;Socialist Delegation to Stockholm, Pastukhov and Asen Tsankov,were discussed.  The whole Delegation of six has now returned toSofia.    On the way back  Mr Sakyzov (head of the Delegation)gave an Interview to the  Internetionale Korre spondenz (to be dis-cussed under another heading).      The chauvinistic attitude ofthe Delegation has aroused;considerable antagonism in internationalistcircles not only in the Germanic  Empires,  but in Bulgaria Itself.The organ of the &quot;Narrow&quot; Socialists, Rabotnicheski Vestnik, has amost biting leading article on June 9, headed &quot;Broad Nationalists&quot;.After roundly declaring that men  like Pastukhov and his  five com-rades are not Socialists  at all,  it goes on to point out at greatlength that these &quot;Socialists&quot; are just as chauvinistic  as theSerbian, Rumanian and Groek chauvinists, whom Bulgarians are taughtto abhor.:  Like them, they say: &quot;First a strong Fatherland and thenbuild up from that a Balkan federation&quot;.  On such lines  anyBalkan settlement by agreement is Impossible.Disagreement between Bulgarian and Allied Soclaiists.     The attitude of the  Austrian, and especially the Hungarian,Socialist; Delegation to Stockholm on the Balkan question and theirrecommendation of a compromise between Serbia and Bulgaria over theMacedonian / controversy roused lively protests in the Bulgarianpress. .&apos; The organ of the Democratic Party grimly tells  theHungarians-that Bulgaria  would be equally justified in proposing
a settlement of the Transilvanian question by an agreement betweenHungary and Rumania.     With regard to German Socialists a similar controversy ispublished in the Internationale Korrespondenz.  Mr Sakyzcv thereset forth his views at length.   He traced the attitude of BulgarianSocialists up till the outbreak of war, till when, he sought toshow, it had been entirely pacifist and opposed to Radoslavov.However, from the time Bulgaria entered the war the Socialists(that is, the Broad Socialists) had seen the only possible futurefor Bulgaria in close association with the Central Powers,   &quot;It isXmthinkaDle that Bulgaria during the war or immediately after itHh.culd turn to the side of the Entente.  There is not in the wholecountry a single man, not even the supporters of Genadiyev (who wasbought by the Entente for 10 million francs), who wishes this&quot;.Sakyzov laid  down positive demands for the incorporation of-Macedonia and at least Southern Dobrogca in Bulgaria,  In reply tothis a Socialist member of the Reidhstag, Hermann Wendel, writesa very temperate article denying the purely Bulgarian character ofMacedonia.  The Macedonian Slavs are neither Bulgars nor Serbs;they are a link between the two, and the only just settlement of theMacedonian question would be by a compromise between the two countriesDobrogea and the Morava Valley.     The Bulgarisation of Dobrogea proceeds steadily week by week.Up till May 23 forty four Bulgarian schools had been opened and setgoing in Horthern Dobrogea.   In an interview the Minister ofAgriculture, Dinchev, positively asserted Bulgarians claims to thev/hole of Dobrogea:  &quot;That country is the cradle of Bulgaria and islinked with Bulgaria^ development even more closely than Macedonia. .From the economic point of view Dobrogea is to-day a productive country;  Macedonia will be- made so in the future&quot;.-
 -  &quot;  The  demand for  the whole  of Dohrogea is made by every party,except the Narrow Socialists,  in Bulgaria.   The Mir had recentlya leading article called  &quot;Bulgaria,  Guardian of the Danube&quot;, inwhich the &quot;whole  of  Dobrogea up to the  mouth of the Danube&quot; wasclaimed for Bulgaria on political and strategical grounds.  MrDinchev looks forward especially to  linking up the Danube with theRhine by  canals.   The connection with Austria-Hungary is to besecured alike by  the Danube  and through the Morava Valley, towhich repeated allusion has already  been made.Economic  Coniiltions.     MT Dinchev in the same interview declared that there was nolack cf food in Bulgaria.  &quot;We know&quot;, he said, &quot;that in this respectwe are better off than our Allies&quot;.   (At this point the Censorinterrupts his revelations).   &quot;The harvest&quot;, he declared, &quot;willbe better than last  year,  for  more land has been under cultivation.This is largely due  to the energy of the troops, who have learntfrom German soldiers the  way to use  the most      modern agriculturalmachines  and appliances&quot;..;     There appears,  however, to be a considerable amount of distressin Bulgaria.  There  are  a number of  refugees in Sofia who arewithout work and  the Press demands  that the Committee of PublicProvisioning should  see  to it  that  they get work.  Mr Sakyzov,in the interview  already discussed,  criticised the Germans for notallowing  Bulgaria more salt, with the result that the previoussummer hundreds of thousands of kilogrammes of cheese were ruined.The Public  Provisioning  Committee  is now dealing ruthlessly Withprofiteering,  and long lists are published of the dealers in foodwho have  been  condemned  to terms  of  imprisonment and fines forselling at  illegally high prices.   Corruption in the public Service
in Bulgaria is,  of course,  proverbial.   This is especially badin the occupied territories,  and a Commissioner from the Ministryof the Interior has been sent to look into the administration ofthe districts of Prizren and Prishtina.     Apparently depreciation of Bulgarian money is causing thefinancial authorities considerable disquiet.  The National Bankof Bulgaria has  now decided to send abroad Mr Mumdzhiyev, Chief   tfea Foreign Exchanges Section, to study the possible measuresto be taken to remedy this.  The serious dearth of live-stock hasalso caused the Ministry of Agriculture  to proceed at once to theapplication of the new law on the improvement of cattle raising.Administrative Changes.     In the last Report it was announced that Mr Zlatanov, Secretary-General of the Ministry of the Interior, had  been appointed tothe same post in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  In this heapparently succeeded Mr Racho Kosev.  It has been conjecturedthat the retirement of Mr Kosev is due  to German intrigues andto his too close relationship with General Racho Petrov.  Mr Kosev,however, does not appear to be much out  of favour, for whileMr- Radoslavov was absent in Germany Kosev was put in charge ofthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  It would, indeed, be difficultto dispense with a man who is the associate of such a power behindthe throne as General Racho Petrov.     Considerable interest has been aroused by the Herbst-Kyorchevcase.  Tho Liberal deputy,  Kyorchev, on  December 29 last in theSabraniye attacked Josef Herbst, who is  an Austrian Jew, Bulgarianby naturalisation and Director of the Press Bureau in Sofia.  The;charge against Herbst was that ho had attacked Individual Bulgarianpoliticians and journalists in his official communiques.   As aresult of the trial Herbst was condemned by a Sofia court-martial
to- six months close imprisonment and a fine of 300 leva forhaving in an official bulletin insulted Kyorchev.                                              A.W.A.L.                                                 16.7.17.
