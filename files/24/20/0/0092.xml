SECRET.                             Intelligence  Bureau,Department of Information.             WEEKLY REPORT ON RUSSIA. XIV...-\                   (July 23, 1917).,The Crisis in Petrograd.     The political crisis in Petrograd, that began with theresignation of the Cadet Ministers, developed with extraordinaryrapidity.  It proved that German agents, working among theExtremists,&apos;were counting upon a political crisis in order tosow disorder in Petrograd-and ruin the offensive In Galicia.For some time past the Cadets have felt very uneasy in aCabinet which was leading them much further to the Left than theywished to go and in which they were a minority.  The Cadetshave always been recognised in Russia as the least adaptable ofthe political parties - although they contain some of the most-experienced politicians in Russia - and their position sincethe Revolution has been one of great difficulty.   Owing toMilyukov&apos;s strong personal influence the party has kept together,and after Milyukov&apos;s resignation it decided that if* one CadetMinister were forced to resign all the other Cadet Ministerswould go with him.     Last week what was feared happened.   Manuilov, Minister ofPublic Instruction, was criticised for his inactivity and lack ofinitiative and was inacceptable to the Council of PeasantDeputies.   His resignation was demanded and immediately hisCadet colleagues threatened to resign with him.  While thismatter was still being discussed the Ukrainian crisis arose.Tseretelli, Tereshchenko and Kerenski came, to an arrangementwith the Ukrainian Rada, which, to the Cadets, was an infringe-
ment of the rights of the Constituent Assembly.  Technicallythey were right, but to the majority of the Cabinet an immediatesettlement of the Ukrainian question was considered imperative,and the three Ministers who had gone to Kiev were supportedboth by Prince Lvov and Nekrasov.     It was when the Cadet Ministers had resigned that theAnarchists: came into the open in Petrograd..  About two daysafterwards the German offensive in Galicia was begun.   Theconnection. between the two movements is obvious, and it is tobe hoped that the very thoroughness of the Germans1 plans willprove their undoing.   The Germans have undoubtedly been waitingfor another political crisis in Petrcgrad,, such as that at thebeginning of May,,, and they have no doubt been counting on thegrowing dissatisfaction of the Cadets in the Ministry..   It wasessential to them to act quickly after the offensive had begunfor fear that the Government would nap idly gain prestige..They knew that there was Increasing impatience in Petrogradat the irresoluteness of the Government In delaying to putdown the Anarchists with a strong hand. .  The Government havebeen pressed by the bourgeois parties to act firmly and arrestthe Extremist leaders, but they hesitated until the offensivesucceeded in strengthening their position.   It was no doubt forthis reason that Kerenski held his hand and when it was forcedby the resignation of the Cadets he described their action asa stab in the back.     The lesson of the Petrograd riots would appear to be thatthe Government, backed by the CW.S.D.,: was really stronger thanIt had Itself expected.  The policy of holding its hand until therioters had grown weary of aimless rioting seems to have had agood effect, because when the loyal troops were called out they
quickly succeeded in gaining the upper hand.     It is difficult to forecast even i$.e immediate future,hut everything goes to show that after his recent experiencesboth in Petrograd and GalIcia, Kerenski will:act with greatfirmness as Prime Minister..   The success gained by theGovernment in Petrograd will make it bolder in dealing withthe Extremists, and, provided the C.W*S0D. shake themselvesfree altogether from the Leninites, the situation in Petrograd .may rapidly improve.  The Germans probably counted on greatersuccess in petrograd than they have had, and it seems probablethat they only renei/ed the offensive in the hope of beingsuccessful both at the front and in the rear.     A strongGovernment in Petrograd may mean a violent reaction againstthe Germans, which will have its effect on the soldiers at thefront.   Since the Revolution the Germans had refrained from anoffensive on the Russian front?   It is to be hoped and expectedthat the effect of their new offensive, though for the momentit looks dangerous in view of the treacherous spirit at workin one portion of the Russian troops, will be to unite theRussian people more firmly than they have been united since theRevolution.The New Cabinet.     The new Cabinet will not be constituted for anotherfortnight, when the All-Russia C,W*SolD. Is to meet in Moscow.Meanwhile the real inner Cabinet seems to consist of $erenski,Tseretelli and Nekrasov.   The attitude of Nekrasov is notquite clear.   He has now definitely abandoned the Cadetsand may join the new Government, when it 1B formed, as aRadical or Moderate Socialist.   If the Government becomes more
forcible it seems probable that Chernov, in spite of hisinfluence among the peasantry, will become more and more asimple head of a Department, as his attitude towards the warhas always been a weak one.   If a Coalition Cabinet is stillmaintained it is probable that most of the non-Socialists,will be in the position of mere heads of Departments and notin the inner circle.The Ukrainian Question.     The immediate cause- of ihe resignation of the CadetMinisters was the settlement made about the Ukrainian question.It has always been a matter of great difficulty to judge theextent of the Ukrainian national movement in Russia, as everymanifestation of it was sternly suppressed under the old regime.Most Russians insisted on regarding the Ukrainians as Russianswith slight differences in language and culture, and they wereprepared to grant them a wide measure of cultural autonomy.Their political claims, however, were not recognised by RussianLiberals.     Since the Revolution the Ukrainian movement has been assumingmore and more serious proportions.  It seems clear that thestrength of the movement was not fully realised in Petrograd.For example, a few weeks ago Air Tereshchenko, himself from Kiev,assured Sir G. Buchanan that the movement was not a serious one.The Provisional Government certainly acted as though theUkrainian question could wait until the Constituent Assembly met,and it may be that but for the critical position in Petrogradand the weakness of the Central Government matters might haveremained where they were In Kiev.
       There were two claims made by the Ukrainian Rada or Nationalf  Council, both of which were inaaeeptable to the Russian Government:  (1) The demand for immediate political autonomy.  (2) The demand  for a separate Ukrainian Army.   The first of these demands was  put forward by the Rada, the second by the Ukrainian Soldiers&apos;  Congress, which is said to represent 1,600,000 Ukrainian soldiers  and strongly supports the Rada.   The demand for immediate  political autonomy was rejected by all political parties in  Petrograd with the exception of the Leninites who were fully  prepared to see a completely independent Ukraine.   This is the  aim of German agents both in Petrograd and in the Ukraine, who,  no doubt, have been working closely together.  The demand for a  separate army was rejected by Kerenski, who refused to reorganise  the Russian army on the eve of the offensive.       The weakness of the Petrograd Government made it impossible  to secure obedience for its orders.  After an unsuccessful  deputation to Petrograd, the Ukrainian Rada issued a manifesto,  ignoring the Russian Government and giving Instructions for  elections to a separate Diet and for the payment of taxes to the  Rada after July 14.  This manifesto was answered by Prince Lvov  who appealed to the Rada to await the d ecision of the Constituent  Assembly in October,  The Rada refused to agree and relations  between Petrograd and Kiev became so strained that Tereshchenko,  Tseretelll and Kerenski had to proceed hurriedly to Kiev and  arrange a compromise which went much further than the Russian  Government had hitherto been prepared to go.  No concessions were  made  in military matters, and the Rada was to be made more  representative.  The members of the Ukraine administration were to  be approved first by the Russian Government who might substitutei  other names.   The success of this arrangement has been proved by

The members of the Ukraine administration were tobe approved first by the Russian Government who might substituteother names.   The success of this arrangement has been proved by
the strong support the Ukrainian Rada is now giving the RussianGovernment.     The Rada is attacked by its opponents for being unrepresentative of the Ukraine.   No &quot;Great&quot; Russians or Jews arerepresented In It, and it is said to be strongly nationalist andchauvinist.   Though it contains a certain number ofSeparatists, the majority of the members are moderateNationalists who have no desire to separate from Russia orignore Russia&apos;s Interests.   Professor Grushevski, thePresident of the Rada, proclaims the political territorialautonomy of the Ukraine within the Russian Federal RepublicHe insists that the position of the Ukraine should be much the     jsame jis that of Bavaria in the German Empire, except that theUkraine&quot; imxst have better guarantees for her economic rights.The extreme Separatists, amongst whom the Germans are no doubtat work, demand an independent Ukrainian Republic free to formalliances with other nations and able to send representativesto the Peace Conference.4                                          R.A.L,23.7.17.
