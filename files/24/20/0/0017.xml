If we  can supply  officers for  India possibly  two more battalions  may  be. available.   This  question  I am investigating  at once.    *     Will you;require anything  from England to enable you to make  full use of  the battaliens relieved from the L. of  0. ?   You are  aware of  the shipping difficulties and  of the time&quot; which is  required to  send you anything from England,  and while I am  anxious to place you  in  the best possible  position for  meeting the expected  Turkish offensive I rely on  your  making: every  possible use of[local  resources.     The 9  field batteries  and  the heavy  battery and  the air  squadron promised you left  a week  ago and I  hope very shortly to  get  off the two; six-inch  howitzer batteries.-     Cc-in-C.,  India,  hopes,to  be able to keep you up to strength and to  send 6,000  additional  drafts  by  middle of August to bring Indian battalions up to British establishment.    I regret that  we are  unable  to  do the same for the British Battalions on Indian Establishment.     , Please let  me know if  you  are satisfied  that  by these  measures you will be  enabled to  meet any attack which  may reasonably be expected.From:&apos;%o:I

Any guns that could be sparedto go into these posts and so free our divisional artilleryentirely would be welcome. I shall probably require 3 additionalbrigade staffs to organize my unallotted battalions and forpurposes ox command but as to these I will communicateseparately from time to time.  These additional 6 battalionsnow promised by India will be of great assistance in furtheringmy policy, which alms at assembling every fighting manavailable on this front,   I shall require however two of thesebattalions from India for administrative duties oncommunications for we are very shorthanded there as alreadyrepresented;  so net gain will be 4 battalions only.  Ourrequirements are always endless but I realize very fully needto economise all round and have for some time past done so*I know too how vital it is that we should not ask for thingswhich are not absolutely necessary at expense of other frontsand I am in consequence developing local resources to bestof my ability.   The results in this respect are encouraging *If then our outstanding demands, especially as regardsMechanical Transport, are fully met and as casualties occur,ranks of our units here are promptly filled, I feel no anxietyas to our ability to meet successfully considerably superiornumbers of Turks.     In fact it should not be impracticable to clearTigris Of Turkish forces by close of this year if Russianswill co-operate vigorously.
