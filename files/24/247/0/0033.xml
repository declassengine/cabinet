[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1934. .SECRET. Copy No.CP. 33 (34).CABINET.Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for India.Policy in regard to Afghanistan.1. It will he remembered that the Cabinet, on 11th October 1932 (Cabinet 50 (32))T approved the draft of a despatch to His iVIajesty&apos;s Minister, Kabul, instructing him on the reply to be returned to an enquiry made by the Afghan Government as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government if the U.S.S.R. attacked Afghanistan. The despatch authorised him, inter alia, to give a specific assurance that in the event of a serious and clearly unprovoked invasion of Afghan territory by Russia, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared, if diplomatic intervention failed, to break off relations (including official commercial relations) with the Soviet Government. It also contained the following passage: &apos;: In this connection His Majesty&apos;s Government have noted that the Defence of India Committee of 1927, whose Report was approved by the Cabinet of that time, assumed (paragraph 41 of their Report) that Russian action of the kind in question would in fact in the last resort be followed by a declaration of war against that Power. But that Report is now five years old, and it may be that the questions dealt with therein are in need of re-examination by the Committee of Imperial Defence. There has been no prospect, however, of undertaking such re-examination in time to admit of its results being available for consideration in connection with the decision cf the reply to be given to the Afghan Governments present enquiry ; and as the need for such a decision is immediate, it has been decided that you)- reply may, if necessary, include, but should not go beyond, the specific assurance contained in paragraph 8 of this despatch.&quot; (This was the assurance mentioned above.)2. It was recognised at the time that it was desirable that the re-examination referred to in] the despatch should take place as soon as was practicable. The matter is of some urgency, not because it is thought that there is any danger in the near future of Russian aggression against Afghanistan, but because the Afghan Government are naturally very nervous regarding the possibility of Russian aggressive designs, and it is desirable to do everything possible to reassure them, in order to avoid the risk of a change in their policy towards us. That policy since the advent of the present Afghan regime has been inspired by a true perception of the community of British and Afghan interests, but there is a clanger that the Afghan Government may not feel strong enough to resist Soviet demands in the political and economic sphere, and that, fearing that repeated refusals of such demands may place such a strain on Russo-Afghan relations as to endanger peace, they may feel compelled to enter into unwise commitments, which would be dangerous to our interests by facilitating the economic and political penetration of Afghanistan by Russia. For this reason it is desirable to stiffen their resistance to Soviet pressure by such assurances of our support as it is possible to give. But the question whether it is possible to go materially further than the assurances already given is one which cannot be decided until we have thoroughly re-examined our own policy in regard to a hypothetical Russo-Afghau conflict.3. Accordingly, the Government of India and the Minister at Kabul were asked at the end of 1932 to report by despatch on the problems dealt with in 1927 in the light of the present situation. These despatches were received in the first half of last year. The Government of India&apos;s despatch was accompanied by a memorandum by their General Staff and Air Staff containing a plan in outline of the military action considered feasible in the light of present conditions in India and Afghanistan.4. The conclusions of the Defence of India Committee of 1927 are succinctly summarised in the minutes of the 232nd meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, 2543      100   2.34
dated 26th. January 1928, copy of which is annexed for ease of reference (Appendix!), and to which we would draw the special attention of our colleagues. It will be observed that it was recognised that the question of the policy to be adopted in the event of any substantial Russian encroachment into Afghanistan turns on whether we have the military power to enforce it. It, follows that in any re-examination of the policy accepted in 1928, one of the first questions to he decided is whether we now have the military power to enforce that policy. The responsibility for advising on this question primarily falls on our expert advisers in this country (since it is a &quot;major &quot;and not a &quot;minor&quot; problem of Indian defence), and may involve some overhaul (in conjunction with the Staffs in India) of the plan approved in 1928.5. We would therefore propose that, as a first step towards the re-examination of the problems dealt with in 1927, the Cabinet might now request the Chiefs of staff Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence to consider existing plans (in conjunction with the General Staff in India), and report if they have any modifica-tions to suggest, and to report whether we have the resources required to enforce the policy accepted in 1928, on the assumption that that policy as regards the preservation-tion of the integrity of Afghanistan will be reaffirmed when it comes to be considered. It will be understood that the question of policy itself remains intact pending the report of our military advisers on its feasibilit3T. Though the preparation of detailed plans may prove to be a lengthy process, it might perhaps be possible for the Chiefs of Staff to make sufficient progress to enable them to make at any rate an interim report within a comparatively short space of time, giving material for an answer to the question whether we have the resources necessary to enforce the policy of preserving the integrity of Afghanistan, or, if not, what additional resources would be required. As soon as such a report is received the Defence of India Committee should be convened for an examination of the main political problem and certain other questions, which were examined in 1927 or have arisen since, with a view to making a report ou all these matters to the Cabinet through, the Committee of Imperial Defence at the earliest possible date.6. There is, however, another immediate question to be considered by the Cabinet. On 12th October last the Afghan Prime Minister approached Sir R. Maconachie in the following sense. A new road has recently been constructed by the Afghan Government through the Hindu Rush to connect Kabul with Northern Afghanistan, and the Soviet Military Attache has put forward a proposal to continue this road to the Oxus, and to connect it by bridge with a possible extension of the Russian railway system, and promised substantial pecuniary assistance for this project. The Afghan Prime Minister stated to Sir R. Maconachie that the Afghan Government must now seriously consider the defence of the northern road, and in this connection wished to consult the British General Staff.The Government of India are inclined to the view that this request on the part of the Afghan Government is a prelude to asking the definite question whether we are prepared to guarantee Afghanistan against Soviet military aggression. An extract (Appendix 2) from their telegram dated 25th November 1933, on this subject, is attached. It will be seen that, on the grounds stated in that telegram, the Government of India recommend to the most, serious consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government the question whether, if we reach the conclusion that military aggression by Russia on Afghanistan would, in the last resort, inevitably lead to military support of Afghanistan, it would not be advisable to inform the Afghan Government accordingly.7. The question which is thus raised by the Government of India is clearly one which must await the Governments decision on the main question of policy itself, which it is proposed to refer to the Defence of India Committee. But as it is evident that some time must elapse before such a decision can be reached, the question arises what attitude His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul should be instructed to adopt in the interval towards the Afghan request for military consultation in connection with the defence of the northern road. Sir R. Maconachie has already been given the instructions, based on his own suggestions, contained in paragraph 4 of the Foreign Office telegram of 13th December, which is annexed (Appendix 3), namely, that if he is approached again by the Afghan Government on the subject he should endeavour to ascertain discreetly what exactly they had in mind in making their request (which, On the face of it, may be merely a request for advice as to the best disposal of their own forces in a limited scheme of local defence, or may, on the other hand, very
probably be intended, as the Government of India anticipate, to draw vis on the question of our own participation in the defence of Northern Afghanistan).8. Sir Ii. Maconachie telegraphed on 26th December that, on reconsideration, he thought it better not to wait until the Afghan request is repeated, but to make the next move himself in the sense of the instructions given him. When he made this recommendation, however, he was unaware of the length of time that must probably elapse before the main question of policy can be decided, during which it will still be necessary for him to play for time. He was therefore asked whether, in the light of this consideration, he still thought it preferable to make the next move himself, but his reply, which has now been received, makes it clear that he still adheres to that recommendation, as he considers that the time has come to make some gesture which will, at any rate, give the Afghans reason to think that we are taking their request seriously,&apos;and he thinks that, if they can be convinced of this, the situation will not become more difficult than at present. The Government of India agree that in all the circumstances Sir R. Maconachie should make the next move.9. Although it may be argued that as no move has been made by the Afghan Government since the assassination of Nadir Shah, and that, as the present Government may be fully occupied in consolidating its own position, the wiser course would be to allow the matter to rest until we have made up our own minds on the major question of policy (which will almost certainly be raised by the Afghans), in a matter of this kind we must be guided by the judgment of the man on the spot. We would therefore propose that the Minister should be authorised to make the next move himself, in the very limited sense of the instructions contained in our telegram of 13th December, as he recommends. His subsequent attitude while he is awaiting His majesty&apos;s Governments decision on the main problem will naturally depend on the Afghan reaction to this move. Yi7e may expect that that reaction will give us some indication whether the Afghans are only seeking advice on the limited question of the best method of defending the northern road with their own resources, or whether and to what extent their request is intended to draw us on the question of our participation in the defence of Northern Afghanistan against possible invasion by Russia. Whatever reply the Afghans may make to his move, Sir R. Maconachie would, of course, report it before taking any further steps.10. If their reply makes it sufficiently clear that it is the former of these questions they have most prominently in mind, it is suggested that Sir R. Maconachie might then be authorised to make a very guarded promise of military advice on this limited question, if he is further pressed on it, and if in his opinion a further delay even of some months in giving an answer on this point would result in serious risk of the Afghan Government making some unwise commitment to Russia, But at the same time we should make it clear that any promise of military advice that can be given at this stage, even on the limited question of the defence of the northen road, should be accompanied by a very careful caveat that this does not involve any military commitment, in order so far as possible to diminish the risk of the Afghans reading wider implications into our share in the ensuing military conversations. In fact, Sir R. iMaconachie should make it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government understand that the Afghan request only contemplates advice on limited and tactical questions connected with the defence of the northern road and on the best disposal of Afghanistan&apos;s own forces for this purpose.11. If, on the other hand, the reaction of the Afghan Government to Sir R. Maconachie&apos;s move indicates that the real object of their request is to draw us into the question of British military support to Afghanistan, then it would clearly not, be possible to give any answer on tbis subject pending the Governments decision on the main question of policy. Sir R. Maconachie should in this case be instructed merely to say that, now that he understands the implications of the Afghan Governments original request, he obviously cannot give an answer offhand, but must report for further instructions. He could, however, so far as possible soften this evasive answer by repeating the general assurances which have already on more&quot; than one occasion been given, to the effect that, since British interests include the maintenance of a strong, independent and friendly Afghanistan, His Majesty&apos;s Government naturally could not regard with indifference unprovoked aggression by a foreign Power against a friendly Afghanistan.J.

APPENDIX I.Extract from the Minutes of the 232nd Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence,held on 26th January 1928.(2) Defence of India. Conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (a) To approve the Conclusions contained in. the First Report of the Defence of India Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 158 D), which may be summarised as follows : (1) The material consequences of any substantial Russian encroachment into Afghanistan would be no less dangerous to India, and no less disastrous to our general interests at the present time than they were in the past. The question of the policy to be adopted in the event of such encroachment turns on whether we have the military power to enforce it.   (Paragraphs 30-35.)(2) To approve in principle the plan which has been drawn up by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in consultation with the Chief of the Air Staff ; and, in particular, to endorse the conception of the execution of the operations on the southern line of advance in Afghanistan by means of mechanised and air forces.   (Paragraphs 36-40.)(3) In so much as the above plan holds out a reasonable prospect that the northern frontier of Afghanistan can be recovered by direct military action, provided that our antecedent preparation is adequate, and that the Empire is prepared to make the necessary effort to adopt, mutatis mutandis, the reaffirmation of the principle enunciated by Lord Balfour in 1903 and endorsed by Lord Morley&apos;s Committee in 1907, &quot; that, by our own plain interest, our obliga-tions to guard the independence and integrity of Afghanistan are unimpaired, and that the deliberate crossing of the Gxus or the occupation of Herat by Russia would be the violation of a frontier which we are bound to defend.&quot; Also, following Lord Morley&apos;s Committee, to assume that, in the last resort, &quot; Russian action of the kind indicated would be followed by a declaration of war against that Power.&quot;   (Paragraphs 41-42.)(4) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should, in consultation with the Chief of the Air Staff and the General Staff in India, elaborate his plan in full detail, showing what is contemplated at each stage during the first year of a war, on the assumptions that -(a) a violation of the frontier of Afghanistan of such a nature as to constitute a casus belli had in fact taken place ;(b) conscription would not be enforced during the first year of war, but that up to 250,000 men of good quality would be obtained by voluntary methods in the first three months after the outbreak of war. (Para-graphs 43-44.)(5) None of the operations which can be undertaken in other parts of the world appear likely to be productive of decisive, or even of very important, results, but the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee should continue their examination of this problem.   (Paragraph 45.)(6) To commend the whole question of the preparedness of the Army and Royal Air Force in India to the serious consideration of the Government of India. In this connection, subject to au3* decision that may later be taken on the wider question of whether India pays too much or too little of the cost of Empire defence, lndia&apos;s responsibility for preparing, in time of peace, for the problems dealt with in this Report, will be discharged if her forces and their equipment are brought up to a scale adequate for war with Afghanistan and the tribes of the North-West Frontier, or to enable India to co-operate with the Imperial forces, in accordance with the role assigned to her by agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India, in the greater contingency of war with Russia in defence of India. (Paragraphs 46-49.)
(7) A friendly Afghanistan being a primary condition of the military plans referred to in (2) above, it is important that any opportunities of&quot;further improving our relations with Afghanistan should be taken, if possible. Some of the measures which might be adopted to that end are :  (a) Definite acceptance of the priociple of assistance to Afghanistan in the development of road and telegraphic communications with India.(6) Assistance, both expert and financial, in the construction of railways (see also Conclusion No. 10 below).(c) Assistance in establishing Exchange Banks in Afghanistan.(d) Assistance in reorganising the Customs and Posts and Telegraph Departments in Afghanistan.(e) The establishment and maintenance of a Civil Air Service between Kabul and Peshawar, conducted by British pilots, and subsidised by the Government of India.   (Paragraphs 50-53.)(8) There would be much advantage in (a) the substitution of Englishmen for Indians in our Consulates at Kandahar and Jalalabad ; and(b) the establishment of Consulates, with British officers in charge, at Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif.   (Paragraph 54.)(9) The strengthening of the Afghan Army in peace would, on the whole, be to our advantage. The Government of India should be invited to submit recommendations on this question. Further, the measures whereby the Afghan Army could be supported and strengthened in the event of the emergency dealt with in this Report should be predetermined. (Paragraphs 55-57.)(10) As regards railway construction in Afghanistan; (a) On the whole we may regard railway extension in Afghanistan, provided that it takes the right form, at least with equanimity, if not with satisfaction.(6) Our Minister at Kabul should be instructed not to make the first move in this matter, even to the extent of encouraging the King of Afghanistan to broach the subject. When, and if, the King does so of his own accord, our Minister should receive the proposal sympathetically, ascertain his intentions as fully as possible, and submit a detailed report to His Majesty&apos;s Government.(c) The programme of construction cannot be determined until the King&apos;s wishes are known ; but it appears desirable that the extension from Landi Kb ana to Kabul should be the first stage and the linking up of Chaman with Kandahar the second. In any event, the whole question should be again examined in India in the light of the findings of this Report, in order that the strategical, commercial, technical and financial aspects of the various alternatives may be duly weighed before the necessity for a decision arises.   (Paragraphs 58-70.)(11) If it should be decided by the Cabinet that any public pronouncement of policy is to be made, it should be couched in language which leaves our discretion unfettered.   (Paragraph 71.)(6) That, after the minor amendments suggested by the Viceroy had been incorporated, the Report should be submitted to the Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. I, 26th January 1928.APPENDIX 2.Extract from Decypher of Telegram from Government of India to Secretary of State for India, dated Delhi, 25th November 1933.... It is further difficult to see how the defence of the northern road can be considered by itself, without reference to the wider problem of maintenance of the integrity of Northern Afghanistan. We are, therefore, inclined to the view that the present request is a prelude to definite question whether we are prepared to guarantee Afghan Government against Soviet military aggression.
We have hitherto held view that, on this question, we cannot commit ourselves further than the replies conveyed in Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&apos; Despatch No. 82, 17th October 1932. We must, however, point out that this non-committal attitude involves a grave risk of driving the Afghan Government to come to an under-standing with. Russia on lines which would endanger the frontiers of India. Although we may be satisfied ourselves that the Soviet Government have no intention of adopting an aggressive military policy in the near future, our military advisers point out that they have, for some time past, been constructing a number of railways all pointing southward towards the Oxus. They now ask for another road from Haibak to the Oxus to be linked with the Russian railway system. These facts cannot be unknown to the Afghans, and we can hardly wonder if they regard this elaborate railway system as designed to facilitate a military offensive against themselves. Fear engendered by this knowledge may induce them, in the absence of any promise from us to help in the defence of Afghanistan, to adopt a pro-Russian policj^ against their better judgment. On the other hand, a closer rapprochement with us, which would follow from a knowledge that we did mean to give them military support against Russian aggression, would probably facilitate improvement of communications between India and Afghanistan, which at present are so inadequate that we should find it impossible to maintain a force of any size, at Kabul. Should, therefore, His Majesty&apos;s Government reach the conclusion that military aggression by Russia on Afghanistan would, after all peaceful expediences had failed, inevitably lead to military support of Afghanistan by His Majesty&apos;s Government, we would recommend to the most serious consideration of His Majest.y&apos;s Government the question whether, in such circum-stances, it would not be advisable to inform the Afghan Government accordingly.APPENDIX 3.Cypher Telegram from Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty&apos;s Minister,Kabul, dated 13th December 1933.84. My telegram of 28th October, No. 64, Government of India&apos;s telegram of 25th November, No. 404-K., and your telegram of 30th November, No. 201. Afghan requests reported iu your telegram of 13th October, No. 152.2. Question raised in penultimate paragraph of Government of India&apos;s telegram, and also question whether it would be advisable for British General Staff to enter ihto military conversations, either generally or in regard to the defence of the northern road, must await consideration by the Defence of India Committee; I should be glad of any observations you may wish to offer on these qtiestions. Meanwhile, it would be premature for you to discuss them with the Afghan Government.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under consideration the immediate question o fthe attitude which you should adopt if Afghan Government renew the requests reported in your telegram 152 in the interval before a decision can be reached. We recognise that in this event you will necessarily be placed in a difficult position. It will be desirable to avoid, so far as possible, the appearance of a negative and unresponsive attitude towards the approach which the Afghan Government have made to us, but at the same time it will be necessary at this stage to avoid any commitment to military conversations.4. In these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government approve the suggestion in paragraph 6 of your telegram 201 if you are approached again by the Afghan Government on the subject of their requests. We suggest that in this even you might have an informal talk with the Prime Minister with the object of ascertaining discreetly, but more precisely than we know at present, what he had in mind in making the request for consultation with the British General Staff in connection with the defence of the northern road. This course might have the additional advantage of giving him an opportunity to unburden himself of his doubts and difficulties, in which case you might be able to show the sympathetic interest of His Majesty&apos;s Government in his problems within the limits of paragraph 5 and the last sentence of paragraph 8 of my Despatch No. 82 of; 17th October 1932, and without at this stage committing His Majesty&apos;s Government or the General Staff in regard to military conversations.
5. As regards the question of supplying arms, His Majesty&apos;s Government appreciate the arguments which weigh with the Government of India against a gift. We note that the Government of India&apos;s conclusions in paragraph 4 of their telegram do not exclude the sale on reasonable terms of such arms, ammunition and aeroplanes as the Afghan Government may require, but that they would prefer to postpone a final reply to the Afghan Government on this subject till after the military cou-versations if these take place. We suggest that if in the meantime the Afghan Government renew their request for arms, you might, if you and the Government of India agree, ask the Afghan Government to state definitely what their requirements are and what terms of payment they would be prepared to offer, with a view to your submitting the matter for sympathetic consideration. You should, however, make it quite clear that it is impossible to make any promise as to the reception of the proposals.It would be so much the better, however, if the Government of India could agree to your saying that in the event of their being able to supply arms they would consider favourably the suggestion of payment by instalments on reasonable and mutually satisfactory terms (see Forminka No. 85).
