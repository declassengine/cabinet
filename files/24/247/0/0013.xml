TrHIS DO CuMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GO YE KNMENT.Copy No .1ST.13(34)- CABINETEmergency Water Bill. Memorandum by Minister of Health.   -The introduction of a measure for dealing with the emergency arising from the prolonged shortage of rain is now, I fear, inevitable.      It would be dangerous to wait any longer.&quot;    The rain which has fallen during the last few days in parts of the country has not made any material difference to water supplies, except in the case of small shallow surface supplies,  such as are found in villages; and I am advised that to redeem the situation we need an amount of rain in the next six weeks entirely outside all reasonable expectationThere has been shortage of rain since March,  1933 and the aggregate shortage is very serious.    The figures for each month from April, 1933 to February, 1934,  stated in percentage, of the &quot;normal&quot;  (that is, the average for 1881-1915) are as follows - 70; 97;    92;    82;    38;    94;    103;    59;    29;    105;     22.        The important months for replenishing supplies are October to February.The emergency arises from the low reserves available for many large towns.     At this time of the year impounding reservoirs are usually full,  and would not be seriously short even in a year of comparative dryness.     Now, however, in many cases the reserve is less than half.      Thus in the case of Sheffield, where the reservoirs when full hold a reserve for 176 days, the present reserve is only sufficient for 76 days.    The following are corresponding figures for a number of other examples - Huddersfield, 170 and 60;    Halifax, 152 and 60;    Bristol,  166 and 86.&apos;The fact that the reserves of so many water undertakers are now low is not a reflection on their administration.     They cannot be expected to provide reserves enough to meet the very rare periods of prolonged drought such as that we have been experiencing. If they did so,    the cost  at which watercould be provided would be largely increased,  in many
cases by an amount equivalent to a permanent addition of as much as l/- in the rates, which most consumers would regard as a wholly-exorbitant insurance for the contingency.    &apos; The rare periods of prolonged drought must be met by economies in the consumption of water, and very large economies can be effected without any serious hardship,  and in the last resort by measures such as those now I) reposed.In summer,  except, a wet summer,  very much mere water is drawn from, the reservoirs than comes in and the reserves gradually become lower, to be replenished during the winter.&apos;    With.few exceptions the towns have so far stood the strain of the drought well;      there are very few where any serious restrictions have had to be imposed,  the principal being Moi-ley, near Leeds, where supplies to works have had to be reduced by 20 per cent.      But unless special measures are taken, the condition in some places may be serious even with normal rainfall in the summer;      and will-be very serious if the summer should bo again dry.If the emergency is to be met means must be provided by which water undertakers can rapidly obtain more water.     &quot;Where they obtain their supplies from streams which are impounded,  an Obligation is always- imposed upon them to pass out of the reservoir to the stream a specified minimum daily quantity of water (called compensation water).     This obligation is very onerous at a time of exceptional drought&apos;.      For instance, one case has been brought to my .notice where the compensation water which has to &quot;be passed out of the reservoir is two million gallons per day, whereas the present flow of the stream feeding the reservoir is under half a million gallons a day.      There are numerous cases of the same kind.      I propose in the Bill to take power to reduce the amount of compensation water.
-    114Power is also - proposed to enable the water undertakers to draw additional supplies from new sources, whether surface or underground; to enable, and, if necessary, to compel, one water undertaker to supply water to another; and to authorise the imposition of fresh restrictions on the use of water, or  where necessary, to impose restrictions, including restrictions on the use of water &quot;by private persons or firms where they are drawing unreasonably on a source of limited capacity and thus reducingthe resources of others.I propose to provide that compensation may be claimed in respect of legal damage from the operation of an Order made under the Bill, but that, in determining the amount, account shall be taken of conditions arising out of the exceptional drought, with a view to apportioning the loss caused thereby between the claimant, the water undertaker, and all other persons whose interests are affected.    This provision seems to me fair &quot;because, if compensation had to be determined in the light of the statutory requirement without regard to the exceptional drought, the riparian owners and other interests ?/ould in effect be insured against the consequences of an exceptional drought at the expense of the general body of water consumers.    The amount of compensation might be determined by a person selected, say, from a panel nominated jointly by the President of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the President of the Chartered Surveyors&apos; Institution, and would be paid by the water undertaker.The Bill would be of most service to the larger urban authoritieso    In rural areas the remedy in most cases where there is water shortage is by a permanent scheme.    It is satisfactory to know that the replies, totalling 452 in all, to a communication which I addressed to each Rural District Council enquiring the position show the situation to be far
better than I had expected, and that in most cases where there is serious shortage measures are being taken,  as, for example,  by carting supplies from a distance.I have received strong representations that a measure such as that proposed is necessary from the British Waterworks Association, which represents practically all the Water Undertakers of the country,  the Institution of Water Engineers and also from numerous  individual undertakersI would suggest tl;ia;t it will facilitate the passage of the measure to present it o,r proceed with it as a matter of special urgency.(Intld.)    3.H.Y.9th March,  1934.
