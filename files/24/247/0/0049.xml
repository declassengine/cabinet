CP. 49 (34).Copy No-cabinet.Proposal to guarantee Protection to the Sheikh of Qatar.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.1 circulate for the information of my colleagues a report on the above subject, No. CCS. 322, prepared on my suggestion by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.2. The report is self-explanatory and I venture to trouble my colleagues with it only because no meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence is likely to take place in the near future, and it is urgent to issue instructions to the Political Resident. I am in general agreement with the conclusions of the Chiefs of Staff, as summarised in paragraph 13 of their report, save on two points : (a) the terms of the guarantee to be given to the Sheikh of Qatar (paragraph 5),(b) the caveat suggested by the Chiefs of Staff in the event of oil not being found (paragraph .11).  ^- ^3. As regards the first of these points I would remark in the first place that Ibn Saud is already committed by his treaties with us to recognising the special treaty relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government with the Sheikh of Qatar; secondly, that the protection a guarantee of which it is now proposed to give the Sheikh of Qatar will have primarily in view, not the regular forces of Ibn Saud (any attack by his regular forces would bring about an entirely different situation affecting the whole of our relations in the Gulf), but the depredations of wandering Bedouin tribes of the desert. I agree at the same time with the Chiefs of Staff that the guarantee which it was originally proposed to give (&quot;full protection&quot; against landward aggression) is too widely stated and that a more restricted guarantee would be preferable. But the Koweit formula, to which they refer, is not entirely appropriate to a Sheikhdom such as the Sheikhdom of Qatar. My own provisional view is that it would suffice to give the Sheikh a guarantee of &quot;protection against unprovoked aggression by land,&quot; but I would suggest that I should be authorised, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to prepare a suitable formula on this point for use by the Resident.4. I appreciate the importance of the second point, but. if an offer of protection is to cany any weight with the Sheikh it is important that it should not be hedged round with conditions which are.likely to deprive it of all its value in the Sheiklfs eyes. Moreover, the Iraq Petroleum Company, if they secure the concession, may well wish to adopt a very conservative attitude towards development of oil found. Here again I would suggest that I should be authorised to discuss the matter further with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to see to what extent, if at all, it is desirable to accompany any undertaking we may give by a specific caveat.5. The course of action which I would submit for the consideration of my colleagues in the circumstances described above is as follows :  (a) That instructions should immediately be sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to initiate negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar on lines which have already been agreed interdepartmentally ; that he should further be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government accept the principle of protection, but that the precise terms of the guarantee to be given are under examination, and that in these circumstances he should endeavour (as he has suggested) to lead the Sheikh to raise the question of protection himself, and, if and when the Sheikh does so, inform him that the issue raised is one of such importance that the instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government must be taken2609      65   2.34and
India Office,20th February 1934.S. H.upon it. This will give us time to reach agreement here interdepartmentally on the terms and nature of our guarautee, while avoiding any delay in the initiation of general discussions between the Resident and the Sheikh. (6) That the precise terms of the guarantee to be given and the reference, if any, to be made to a caveat in the event of oil not being found should form the subject of discussion between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and myself, with a view to instructions being sent in such terms as we may, after furthur consideration, consider suitable, the terms of any such instructions to be circulated in due course for information to the Committee of Imperial Defence.
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   February 1934.SECRET. Copy No.C.Q.S. 322.(Also C.I.D. Paper No. 1129-B.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.PERSIAN GULFProposal to Guarantee Protection to the Sheikh of Qatar.Report.General Situation.THE peninsula of Qatar lies between the Sheikhdom of Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhdoms on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. This peninsula is at present ruled by a Sheikh reported to be a somewhat obstinate old man  who exercises no effective rule over the hinterland between the base of the peninsula and the territory of King Ibn Saud. The Sheikh is in special relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government which preclude him inter alia from granting an oil concession without their consent. With their approval the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have been negotiating for a concession, which they would transfer, if they obtained it, to the Iraq Petroleum Company a Company registered in Great Britain, whose capital is held by an international group, some 30 per cent, of which is British. Difficulty has arisen over terms, and there is now strong-reason to believe that the Standard Oil Company of California, who are purely American in composition, are making overtures to the Sheikh, and will exert themselves to obtain a concession. We understand that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment consider it most important to prevent foreign interests from establishing themselves in the Gulf Sheikhdoms. In these circumstances the question of possible inducements to the Sheikh to grant a concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has been under consideration interdepartmentally in consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India. As a result it appears that the only inducement likely to turn the scale in favour of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is an undertaking to grant the Sheikh protection against landward aggression.Question under reference.2. We have accordingly been asked by the Prime Minister for an expression of our views as to whether the advantage of keeping foreign oil interests out of the Qatar Peninsula justifies the assumption by His Majesty&apos;s Government of an undertaking to protect the Sheikh against landward aggression.Importance of British Interests.3. We fully appreciate the importance of retaining the special position of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf, and agree that any concession for oil that may be granted in the Qatar Peninsula should be given into the hands of a company registered in Great Britain. We have accordingly examined the commitment involved, and consider that certain safe-guards are required.   These are as follows.[9661]
Extent of Commitment.4. We note that it is proposed to authorise the Resident in the Persian Gulf to promise the Sheikh, in exchange for the grant of the concession to a British controlled combine, the grant of full protection against aggression by land. It would appear that there is no definite line of demarcation between the territory of the Sheikh and that of Ibn Saud, and, consequently, no limit to the area for which responsibility for protection would be undertaken. We consider, therefore, that some definite boundary should be fixed before any guarantee of protection is made.Terms of Guarantee.5. As the main object in undertaking this commitment appears to be to secure the Sheikh from aggression, or any attempt at absorption, by Ibn Saud, we suggest that any guarantee that may be given should be expressed in more general terms than is at present proposed. Though the actual wording to be adopted is not our immediate concern, we would suggest that the guarantee of protection should be similar to that given in 1914 to the Sheikh of Koweit, namely, that Qatar shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.If this or some similar formula is adopted, it will be clear to Ibn Saud that any aggression against the Sheikh&apos;s territory would be regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government as a hostile act.Guarantee only Applicable to Unprovoked Aggression.6. We attach special importance to the guarantee being made applicable only in the event of unprovoked aggression. We consider that the Sheikh should consent to be guided by the advice of His Majesty&apos;s Government in his attitude towards his neighbours, and that he should be categorically warned that the adoption of a provocative attitude or any indulgence in raiding will result in the forfeiture of protection.Local Protection.7. It is obviously impracticable to guarantee protection, either to the Sheikh&apos;s subjects or even to the oilfields, against the sporadic raiding which we understand is endemic in this region. We consider, therefore, that the Sheikh should be informed that responsibility for law and order in his territory remains in his hands and that he will be expected to provide the necessary means for securing the local protection of the plant and properties of the Oil Company.Facilities for the Royal Air Force.8. In the event of our having to implement our guarantee by the employ-ment of air forces, it would be necessary for aircraft to operate from landing-grounds in the peninsula, probably near Doha, the principal, if not the only port. Though landing grounds exist at Bahrein and Yas Island, some ninety miles north and south respectively of Doha, it will be necessary to establish one or more landing- grounds in Qatar in peace time, together with the necessary storage and other facilities.Intelligence.9. In order to enable effective action to be taken, timely warning of any hostile gathering or intended raid is necessary. As our existing intelligence resources in these regions are very limited, we consider that some provision should be made to supplement the existing sources of information and to foster relations with the friendly tribes. We consider that the Sheikh should grant permission for a British Intelligence or Political Officer to reside in Qatar, if necessary, and in any event to have freedom for himself and his assistants to move about the country.Means of Implementing our Commitment.10. Should it be necessary to implement our commitment, dependence will primarily be placed on the Royal Air Force.    In the event of emergency, the
squadron at Shaibah 3^ hours&apos; flight from Doha would be called upon to take action, according to the situation, to disperse any hostile gathering, and thus render any large-scale attack by Ibn Saud&apos;s tribal forces impossible. It will be noted that, owing to the accident of water, raiding parties are tied down to certain definite lines of approach. We consider it essential that aircraft should be permitted to take action against those objectives most likely to give the required results, and that their use should not be confined to whatever boundaries the Sheikh&apos;s domain may eventually be fixed.The presence of one of His Majesty&apos;s ships on the coast of the peninsula would have a. great moral value, besides, if necessary, affording some degree of local ground protection.If an emergency developed which it was beyond the power of the Navy and Royal Air Force to deal with with the forces available locally, we would suggest that the Government of India should be approached with a view to the provision of the necessary troops for the period of the emergency.We consider that, subject to the above safeguards, the commitment can be fulfilled, since with our existing forces it should be possible to deter Ibn Saud from making any formal attack and to disperse and to punish any major raids.Caveat in event of Oil not being found.11. We are not yet aware of the approximate situation of the oilfields, nor even if oil has been located in workable quantities. We consider it desirable that some caveat should be entered to the effect that our guarantee of protection is dependent upon oil being found and the concession taken up and worked within some limited time.Reference to the Committee of Imperial Defence.12. As a matter of procedure, we presume that the proposed commitment will not be entered into without prior consideration at the Committee of Imperial Defence, on which all Government Departments are represented. This, we under -stand, would follow precedents already established in the case of the military aspects of the Iraq Treaty, the proposed Treaty with Egypt and the Status of Tangier.Conclusion.13.   Our conclusions may be summarised as follows: (1) (a) That the principle of endeavouring to secure the Qatar oil concession for a company registered in Great Britain is in the best interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government (paragraph 3).(6) That as a preliminary to any guarantee of protection, the boundary of Qatar should be decided upon (paragraph 4).(c) That any guarantee given should be framed in more general terms thanthose at present proposed (paragraph 5).(d) That it should be made clear that the guarantee applies only tounprovoked aggression, and that the Sheikh must take reasonable steps for his own protection and for the safety of British and foreign personnel (paragraphs 6 and 7). -(e) That a landing ground, with the necessary storage facilities, should beprovided in Qatar, and that an adequate system of intelligence should be instituted (paragraphs 8 and 9). (2) We consider that, subject to the above safeguards, the commitment can, if necessary, be fulfilled, and that there is no objection to a suitably qualified assurance being given to the Sheikh (paragraph 10).(Signed) ERNLE CHATFIELD.A.

SHEIKHDOM OF QATAR    -    QUESTION OF GIVING GUARAKTBBS.A meeting of Ministers was held immediately after a meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence to consider the question of whether or not guarantees we re &quot;to he given to the Sheikh, of Qatar in order to try and ensure that any oil concessions were given to&apos;the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.TEE PRIME MINISTER said it would he necessary for a report to he made to the Cabinet 9 and he would like to have the viev/s of his colleagues.MR.   THOMAS said he was impressed by what Sir John Maffey had said.       He wondered if Sir Samuel Hoare could find out before the next meeting of the Cabinet what the re-actions of the Sheikh were likely to be in respect of the proposed guarantees,, so that the position might be clari fled.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that the opinion which had been put forward by the India Office was the considered opinion of the Resident in the Persian Gulf and also of the Government of India, and was the result of many weeks&apos;  very careful examination.In answer to a question from the Prime Minister he said he did not think it was altogether true to say that our polltical a gents were unpopular with the tribes.     He agreed that if it was found when the conversations were begun that the reactions of the Sheikh were unfavourable, then it might be necessary to reconsider the position.      He emphasised, however  that the conversations were likely to take some time.MR, BALD?/IN said the position as he saw it was that we , wanted to have any oil concession if oil existed and we were anxious to keep out any American company,       He thought
that both these conclusions v/ere right.      Sir Samuel Hoare thought that if we offered certain guarantees to the Sheikh we ought to get the oil concessions and if we got the concession then v/e should have to guarantee certain protection.     He assumed that investigations to see if oil was present would he carried out quickly end that if it was found there was no oil there, then the guarantee would automatically lapse;    that is to say, that the protection would only he guaranteed on account of the oil.SIR SAMJBL hoare was a little doubtful  if it was possible to insist on a caveat of this kind being included.SIR BOLTON EYRES MONSELL asked what value the Sheikh attached to  the present guarantee we gave him regarding aggression from the sea.      He wondered if it might be possible to squeeze him a little over that.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said he thought the Sheikh did not attach so much importance to that now, but was more inclined to think Of Ibn Saud and the Bedouin tribes, lie was quite clear that if trouble arose in this area we should have to go in and clear it up.ME.  BALDWIN suggested that in the first place negotiations should be opened with the Sheikh in order to see exactly what he wanted.      he thought it was difficults in the light of the information we at present possessed, to lay down any hard and fast rules at the present time.      Once we knew what the Sheikh wanted, then we were in a better position to judge what was the right action to take.
SIR SAMUEL HOARE said the Goverriment of India thought it was impossible to start these negotiations unless there was some bait to hold out to the Sheikh. Next August the present prospecting licence of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would run out.    As the matter at present stood, if another country came along and demanded a concession, under our treaty agreement with the Sheikh he would be bound to refuse unless we were agreeable. If the Americans were to come along the Foreign Office considered that we should be put in an impossible position,  and that if the American offer was a good one end v/e adopted an obstructive attitude it might embarrass our relations generally with the United States. If, on the other hand, we had come to an arrangement with the Sheikh, it would be much easier for us to refuse to let America in because we could say that we had given certain specific guarantees to the Sheikh in view of the concession he had granted to us.As regards Koweit, the American company of Mellon had been very persistent and he thought the Foreign Office had found it rather difficult to maintain a refusal when we had nothing to offer in return.    In this case, however, v/e had got something definite to offer.SIR BOLT ON EYRES MONSELL said that supposing the Standard Oil Company were tog et a concession and difficulties arose or any of their personnel were murdered, we should feel more or less bound to take some steps.     At least, he thought it might be very difficult for us to stand aside.SIR SAMUEL HOARE agreed that it would be impossible to keep out in this case, and he thought it was very
important from the point of view of the air route and our other interests that we should make sure of our position, in fact he was net certain that v/e might not endanger the whole air route   on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf if we did not come to an agreement with the Sheikh.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether it was definitely known if we were to offer something on tho lines proposed the Sheikh v/ould accept.SIR SAMUEL HOARS pointed out that the Sheikh was really a very small and humble person, and that this was importait to bear in mind.LORD LONDONDERRY said he was certain of one thing, whichwas that these Sheikhs did look to us for protection and help.       This had been brought home to him very clearly in conversations he had had with officials in the Persian Gulf on his recent flight to India.THE PRIME MINISTER said that one had also to remember that modern tendencies were to be observed in Arabic countries just as much as they v/ere in other places, and it therefore behoved us to be cautious in what we did.MR.  THOMAS said that if Sir John Maffey&apos;s idea was ad-opted, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company offered a sum to the Sheikh sufficient to enable him to raise a protective force, might not there be a definite risk that the American company might step in and offer more than our own oil company proposed?SIR SAMUEL HOARS said that in any case he was very much against starting the proceedings with the suggestion of payment.
THE PRIME MINISTER said it seemed to him that any approval which might be finally given to the proposal must depend on the lines of the formula which would have to be worked out.MR. THOMAS suggested that agreement might be come to for negotiations to be opened, subject to Sir Samuel Hoare keeping his colleagues informed of the position.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said he thought the first step was to get the Departments to agree first to the formula on which the Resident could open his conversations. This formula would be something between the full guarantee which had been suggested by the India Office and the limited guarantee which the Chiefs of Staff had put forward.       He suggested that the Departments concerned should be got together as soon as possible to work out a suitable formula.     If the reactions to the conversations should be unfavourable, then the matter might have to be reconsidered.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that in this case the matter would have to be brought up again.      It would be necessary to  submit a report to the Cabinet, and he thought that the first recommendation, at any rate, should be that it was desired that the concession should remain in British hands.     Secondly that, in accordance with the formula which would have to b e worked out and would be available to the Cabinet,  it might be possible to recommend     that the Cabinet should authorise   an approach by the Resident to the Sheikh on the lines of this formula and that Sir Samuel Hoare should keep his colleagues in touch with the progress of the negotiations. He would be glad if he and certain of his colleagues could be shown the proposed formula before the meeting of the Cabinet,As regards the question of boundary suggested in the
SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that he would ask the Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East to consider the matter urgently.CONCLUSIONS.It was agreed to recommend to the Cabinet :-(i)    that it was desirable, in principle, that any oil concessions granted in the Sheikhdom of Qatar should be retained in British hands?(ii)    that before the question of the opening of negotiations could be considered further it v/ould be necessary to draw up a formula as to the basis of such negotiations; this formula to represent a middle course between the proposals of the Secretary of State for India for full and complete guarantees and the recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff for a guarantee   limited to protection against major aggression;(lii)    to instruct the Standing OfficialSub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East to work out a formula on the lines indicated in (ii) above as early as possible;(iv)    that there should be included in the formula document an indication of the geographical boundary which would limit the extent of any guarantee that might be contemplated;(v)    that a short report to the Cabinet, should be drawn up for consideration at their next meeting which would include the formula to be suggested by the Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East, together with a further recommendation that if approval was given to open negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar on the lines of the formula to be prepared, the Secretary of State for India should be asked to keep his colleagues in touch with the progress of the negotiations, and that if they developed unfavourably the basis might have to be reconsidered.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.V/.1., 22nd February, 1934.Chiefs of Staffs Report, he thought that the proposal should be included in the formula document.
