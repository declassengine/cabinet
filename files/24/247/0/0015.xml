this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;8 governmentLEAGUE  OF  NATIONS. January 1, 1934.CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.: W 80/1/98] No. 1.Note by Sir R. Vansittart.THE French Ambassador called on me this afternoon, on the instructions of his Government, and read me a resume of the French reply to Germany. The resume itself was so lengthy that I begged him to let me have a copy of it, as otherwise I should be almost certain to overlook some point in recording it for the information of His Majesty&apos;s Government. He promised to let me have the resume immediately. I have not yet received it, but set down here the chief substance of our conversation.I told the Ambassador at once of the apprehensions that I had had on Saturday when I had understood that the French Government might be about to send to Herr Hitler a reply declining to go beyond the October proposals. I had been afraid that, if the reply was of such a curt nature, all possibility of further conversations would be stopped and there would be no possibility either of an agreement or of getting Herr Hitler into the open. I told the Ambassador of the telegram that I had therefore sent to Lord Tyrrell (see my telegram No. 249 of the 30th December). I was bound to say, however, that, having listened to the summary, my apprehensions were somewhat relieved. If the actual wording of the communication itself was as conciliatory as the tone of the resume which I had just heard, I hoped that there might be a chance of the communication passing off without too ill a tactical effect.As to the detail of the summary, I had one or two observations to offer. The French Government had stated the condition that any new pacts to be contemplated should not weaken or invalidate the existing ones, such as Locarno. I reminded the Ambassador that Herr Hitler had already stated that he considered himself to be bound by Locarno. M. Corbin replied that he thought Herr Hitler had weakened in this respect lately. I said that I thought the question of fresh pacts was the easiest part of the matter. If an agreement could be reached as regards disarmament, I thought there would be no real difficulty in getting the necessary assurances from Germany without damage to existing obligations. Indeed, I thought that additional guarantees provided by Herr Hitler himself would considerably strengthen the guarantees given by his predecessors. The Ambassador seemed a little inclined to dispute this view, but he did not attempt to do so in any detail.I said that I also noticed that Austria had been brought into the projected scope of these new pacts, since, according to the resume, Germany was required to give assurances against interference in the affairs of her neighbours. I said that we were all as much as ever interested in the independence of Austria and in sympathy with the efforts of Dr. Dollfuss to maintain it. As a pure matter of tactics, however, I personalty doubted whether the French had chosen the most propitious moment for endeavouring to slip in this additional obligation upon Germany. The best time for such an attempt would, in my judgment, have been the moment when, if ever, negotiations were going well both as regards disarmament and pacts. In any given moment of expansive warmth there might have been a chance that Herr Hitler would give way upon what was with him the obsession of a renegade. As it was, he could quite well reply that pacts of non-aggression had nothing to do with Austria, and I should be agreeably surprised if the obvious introduction of Austria at the very beginning did not have upon Herr Hitler the effect of an irritant. The Ambassador suggested that the German Chancellor might possibly not detect the implication of this desideratum, and I replied that I was sure that Herr Hitler was not so obtuse as that.Thirdly, I noted that the French, as a proof of good faith, were making the offer of an immediate 50 per cent, cut all round in the air. I fully sympathised with the idea that France should make gestures to prove her good faith in the[11 a-1]
matter of disarmament, and I understood that, as the Ambassador had informed me at the outset of our conversation, it was because the Germans bad impugned this good faith that the French Government had felt, after mature consideration, compelled to send the reply without further delay, although they had not led the Secretary of State to infer from his last conversation in Paris that any such step was being decided upon. What, however, did somewhat surprise me in regard to this proposal for a 50 per cent, cut all round in the air was that our position on this specific point had been made perfectly clear to the French Government in our conversations on the 18th September and the 22nd September. It had then been explained to the French Government why this proposal was not suitable or acceptable to us. M. Daladier and M. Paul-Boncour, I said, speaking from memory, had quite recognised the justice of our case, and -M. Daladier had suggested that some other solution might be found or that the cut should be based on some year when our establishment was more nearly equal to that of the other principal air Powers than was at present the case. The Ambassador appeared to be somewhat embarrassed by this, but he appeared to me also to know very little of the detail of the September conversations.While the tone of the French communication did, indeed, seem to be as conciliatory as its substance permitted (and that, of course, is a considerable restriction), and while the Ambassador emphasised again that, so far from closing the door on conversations, the French intended their communication to keep the door wide open, the Ambassador himself did not appear to me to be in a hopeful mood. He said that, to his mind, the matter of the huge reservoir of trained men constituted by the S.A. and S.S. detachments was the chief obstacle to agreement and the chief menace to the future. In this I said I was inclined to agree with him. It was of no use, however, for either the French or ourselves to expect Herr Hitler to dissolve them. That would be equivalent to asking him to sign the death warrant of his own regime. All that could be expected was a strict supervision of these forces with a view to preventing them from acquiring too marked a military character. It might be also that these forces could somehow be eventually absorbed into the Reichswehr. I understood that the German Chancellor was ready to accept some such form of supervision and control, and that all would depend on the extent and rigidity of that control. I believed that experts considered that such supervision could be effectively established and carried out, though, as a layman, I must confess that I thought, whatever its form, it would be exceedingly difficult to exercise over the whole extent of the country.I told the Ambassador again that I would report to my Government that he had written me this resume and that I had commented on it in these terms, and I begged him again to let me have at least a full summary in writing as soon as possible.P. V.Foreign Office, January 1, 1934.
