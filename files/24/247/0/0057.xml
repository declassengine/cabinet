Copy No.  41CP. 57 (34).CABINET.THE ROYAL AIR FORCE PROGRAMME FOR 1934.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.I CIRCULATE this note to acquaint my colleagues with the developments since last November in regard to the Royal Air Force programme for next year and the amount of 1934 Air Estimates.2. They will recall that in CP. 245 (33) of the 24th October I proposed the following programme of new units :- (a) The formation of two squadrons for Home Defence, which will still leave 8 squadrons of the 1923 scheme outstanding.(b) The reconstitution on an effective basis of two Home Defence squadrons at present incorporated in one of our experimental establishments.(c) The formation of one flying boat squadron.I also forecast that this programme should not entail an increase of Air Estimates in excess of  300,000.3. At the Cabinet meeting on the 8th November, the Chancellor intimated that he was prepared to accept this programme, but finally the Cabinet decided that the matter should be left over &quot; until the Chancellor of the Exchequer had received the Estimates of the three Services and could submit a comprehensive programme of their requirements.&quot;4. The Chancellor has now had before him the Estimates of all three Services, and, after their due correlation, has confirmed his agreement in the programme above indicated, which I have now been able to undertake to implement with an increase of only  135,000 in our net Estimates. These will then remain substantially lower (after allowing for bookkeeping adjustments) than two years ago, and approximately  1,000,000 lower than in 1931.5. In addition, two flights (or the equivalent of one squadron) are to be added to the Fleet Air Arm, which is, of course, an integral part of the Royal Air Force as well as an essential component of the Navy, making, with the units mentioned in paragraph 2 above, a total of four new squadrons to be formed.6. I regret to have to state that other Powers, almost without exception, are pursuing a far more active policy of air development.Thus the following foreign countries have either approved or are under-stood to be about to approve substantial increases in air expenditure, in most cases largely in excess of our own :  United States.Italy.Russia.Japan.Switzerland.Czechoslovakia.[9701]

As regards our first-line strength, the addition of these four squadrons will have but little effect in bridging the gap which at present exists between the Royal Air Force and the Air Services of the principal foreign Air Powers. As I mentioned in CP. 245 (33), Soviet Russia, in particular, is in the midst of a vast programme of expansion, and reports received since the date of that paper indicate that she has now equalled, if, indeed, she has not actually outstripped, the strength of the French Air Force.The net result is that both France and Russia now have roughly twice our first-line strength in the air.8. I am naturally gravely perturbed at this situation. I would remind my colleagues that the announcement which we made in November last that this country could not accept a position of continuing inferiority in the air, but must insist on full parity, was endorsed by 74 per cent, of the London and Provincial press (vide CP. 305 (33)). I fear that, in other than pacifist quarters, the very limited extent of our next year&apos;s programme will arouse considerable criticism. I have felt, however, that with the fate of the Disarmament Convention still undecided, it would not be advisable to consider any more extensive measures in the coming year quite apart from such practical difficulties as the training of personnel, the acquisition - of land for aerodromes, and the construction of buildings, all of which require some years for completion.Xj.A ir Ministry, February 22, 1934.
