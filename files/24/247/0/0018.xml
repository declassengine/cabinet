Copy No.CP. 18 (34).CABINET.ANGLO-PERSIAN RELATIONS.Proposed Negotiations with the Shah.Report by the Standing Ministerial Sub-Committee for Questions concerningthe Middle East.Sir J. Cadman&apos;s Views.THE Cabinet at their meeting on Tuesday, the 16th January, 1934, had under consideration a note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 297 (33) ) reporting a conversation with Sir John Cadman on the subject of resuming negotiations for a treaty with Persia. Sir John Cadman had expressed the view that, while the Shah was anxious to establish close and friendly relations and to conclude a treaty, results were not likely to be achieved by the normal diplomatic methods. He had suggested that special measures to ensure personal contact with the Shah himself would be necessary in order to-complete a settlement.Views of His Mnjesti/s Minister. Tehran.__2r**&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Minister^? Sir Reginald Hoare^) at Tehran has also reported in a despatch, dated the 19th December, that at an audience which he had with the Shah on that day His Imperial Majesty expressed his anxiety that treaty negotiations should be resumed as soon as possible and that they should be pressed to a conclusion. The audience also showed that the recent incidents at Basidu and the difficulties which have recently arisen in connexion with articles in the British press no longer constitute an obstacle to a resumption of negotiations, and Sir R. Hoare considers the moment particularly favourable for such a resumption.Previous Discussions.3. The question of our relations with Persia has been under constant review by the Departments concerned and by the Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions concerning the Middle East. In August 1933 advantage was taken of Sir Reginald Hoare&apos;s presence in England to discuss this question and to agree on the general lines of the instructions to be issued to him for his guidance if, and when, an opportunity for the reopening of negotiations should occur.Present Situation.4. We have, as directed by the Cabinet, examined the general situation, and we agree that the present moment is a favourable one for resuming negotiations, and that some immediate response should be made to the Shah&apos;s overtures. We unanimously recommend that Sir Reginald Hoare be instructed at once to resume treaty negotiations with the Persian Government.Instructions to His Majesty&apos;s Minister.5. We have considered the general lines of the instructions which it is proposed to issue to Sir Reginald Floare.   These draft instructions are attached[9565]
as an appendix. We agree with the essential conditions representing our require-ments and the concessions which we are prepared to make, which are described in paragraphs. ,6.,and 7 below. We recommend that these draft instructions be approved......Requirements. &quot;-- ., , .&apos;6. We have&apos;examined our minimum1 requirements as set forth in the instruc-tions, and&apos;consider that Persian acceptance of the following three points should be an essential condition of a treaty settlement : (a) Bahrein, &amp;c. A definite renunciation of Persia&apos;s ill-founded, but vigorously maintained, claims to the islands of Bahrein, Tamb, Nabiyu Tamb and Abu Musa, which are in the possession of Arab rulers in special treaty relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government. (P. 12 of enclosure No. 1 in the draft instructions.)(b) Henjam Naval Station. An arrangement securing to His Majesty&apos;s Government the continuance for not less than twenty-five years of the facilities hitherto available to His Majesty&apos;s ships at Henjam. Since the previous course of the negotiations has shown clearly that the Persian Government cannot be induced to agree to a regular lease, it is proposed to give Sir R. Hoare discretion as to the precise form of the arrangement. He would also be instructed to try to secure adequate safeguards against vexatious behaviour towards His Majesty&apos;s Navy by local Persian officials.,   (See paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of draft instructions.)(c) Arab States of the Persian Gulf. An article (on the lines worked out in the previous negotiations) which would combine the recognition by Persia of the Arab Rulers of the Gulf, and of the right of His Majesty&apos;s Government to conduct affairs with the Persian Government on behalf of these rulers, with an undertaking in regard to non-aggression, as between Persia on the one hand and His Majesty&apos;s Government and those Arab Rulers on the other.;    (Paragraph 7 of draft instructions and p. 2 of enclosure No. 1 therein.)Concessions.7. In return for the above desiderata we agree that Sir Reginald Hoare should be authorised to make the following concessions :  (a) Persian Debt. At an earlier stage of the negotiations His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India decided that, since the Persian Government steadfastly refused to acknowledge Persia&apos;s war and post-war debt to them, even at the reduced figure of  1,510,000, the only practicable course was to make a virtue of necessity and to represent the formal remission of the whole debt as a concession in the treaty. So far, however, complete remission of the debt has not been offered. In January 1930 the Persians were informed that, as a condition of a satisfactory general settlement, His Majesty&apos;s Government would reduce the amount of the debt, as agreed in 1926, by a further  1,000,000, i.e., to  510,000. It would be possible for the purposes of the forthcoming negotiations to say that the 1930 offer (since it was conditional upon a satisfactory general settlement, which was not, in fact, reached) has lapsed, and that the debt now stands at  1,510,000. Moreover, if it were desired to present to the Persians, for bargaining purposes, as high a figure as possible, interest since April 1926 could be added to this figure.It is now proposed, with the approval of the Treasury and the Secretary of State for India, to authorise Sir R. Hoare to consent, at whatever moment in the negotiations he considers most likely to be effective and without further reference to His Majesty&apos;s Government, to the remission of the whole of the outstanding debt as part of an acceptable treaty settlement. It is left to Sir R. Hoare&apos;s discretion to decide whether, as a matter of bargaining, he should at the outset stipulate for the repayment of a sum considerably greater than  510,000, which sum the Persian Government may regard as being the ; last word of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the subject (paragraph 14 of draft instructions). .(b) Basidu. As already decided, and as the Persian Government have already been informed, His Majesty&apos;s Government will renounce, as part of
... a treaty settlement, any rights, that they may possess at.Basidu (p. 11 of ^enclosure No. 1 in the draft instructions). - * &apos;(c) Zahedan Railway. This is a line on Persian soil some 60 -miles long, connecting the Persian town of Zahedan with the Indian railway system at Mirjawa; it was constructed during the War without the consent&apos;of; the Persian Government, and was exploited by the Indian railway administra-tion until, as a result of certain customs difficulties, both the -Persian extension and the Indian .section, about 85 miles long, between the frontier and Nok-Kundi were closed down by, them in 1931. The Government of India have consented to the maintenance of the offer already made to the Persian Government that as part of a general treaty settlement the railway should be handed over to Persia, and, furthermore, that on certain specified conditions the connecting Indian section should be operated (in spite of considerable loss on working) in correspondence with the Persian section for a period of not less than five years (paragraph 12 of the draft instructions and p. 17 of enclosure No. 1 therein).Method of Negotiation.8. We have given attention to the consideration that difficulties may arise owing to negligence or obstruction on the part of the Persian Ministers or to their fear of the Shah, and that in such an event it may be necessary to adopt special means of obtaining access to the Shah himself (as suggested in CP. 297 (33) ). It would seem in accordance with the Shah&apos;s character that he should wish to come in himself at the end of the negotiations and bring about a final decision, thus obtaining the kudos for securing a settlement. While we agree Avith the view that some direct personal appeal to the Shah may well prove necessary in order to clinch the matter and secure the conclusion of a treaty, we consider that, in the first instance at least, negotiations should be conducted through the normal diplomatic channels, more especially as it has now been shown that these do not exclude conversations between Sir R. Hoare and the Shah. Moreover, negotiations will involve much work of a detailed and preparatory nature which can best be discussed by ordinary conversations between Sir R. Hoare and the Persian Ministers. We are of opinion, however, that, in the event of a deadlock or of apparent obstruction on the part of the Persian Ministers, it may be necessary to reconsider the question of finding some special means to secure the personal intervention of the Shah himself.Summary of Conclusions.9. We recommend therefore that His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Tehran should be instructed (a) At once to resume treaty negotiations with the Persian Government, onthe lines embodied in the attached draft instructions (paragraphs 4 and 5);(b) To report immediately if the negotiations are held up owing to negligenceor obstruction on the part of the Persian Ministers or their fear of the Shah (paragraph 8).-JOHN SIMON.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, January 23, 1934.N.B.-In the &quot;absence of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is abroad, the proceedings were, at the direction of the Cabinet, presided over by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

HOARE.Sir, Foreign Office, January    , 1934.I TRANSMIT to you herewith a memorandum, prepared in the Foreign Office, showing the position reached on the 17th January, 1934, as regards the drafting of the proposed Anglo-Persian General Treaty. In your discussions with the Persian Government on this subject, I request that you will be guided by this memorandum, and by the following more general observations.2. As you are aware, the major issues to be dealt with in the treaty have of late been examined afresh by the various interested Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government. You yourself were present at a meeting of the Middle East Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, held on the 1st August, when it was decided to recommend that you should be instructed to endeavour to secure the consent of the Persian Government to a &quot; gentlemen&apos;s agreement &quot; providing for the continued use of Henjam by His Majesty&apos;s ships, which, as you know, is one of the essential requirements of His Majesty&apos;s Government. This recommendation has now been accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is evident that in determining the precise wording of such an agreement much will depend upon the response of the Persian Government to the suggestion as ;a whole, and I do not wish to hamper your freedom of action in the forthcoming negotiations by giving you at the present stage a definite text. For your general guidance, however, I enclose herein an extract from the conclusions of the meeting of the Middle East Official Sub-Committee referred to above. If the agreement regarding Henjam is not incorporated in the treaty, it must never-theless, as you will realise, be a written agreement, and must be in a form as binding as the treaty itself. It would of course be necessary, in particular, to arrange with the Persian Government for the ratification by the Majlis of such a separate agreement if this is required under the Persian Constitution or Persian law.3. The Admiralty attach great importance to reducing to a minimum the petty annoyances which have recently been experienced at Henjam, and if you can devise any formula likely to be effective in checking such annoyances, or one which will at least provide a text for a diplomatic protest if they continue, you should endeavour to secure its acceptance by the Persian Government.4. The period during which the agreement is to remain in force should be as long as possible, and should, in any case, be not less than twenty-five years. If possible, provision should be made for the automatic extension of this period unless either party gives due notice of termination.5. You will recall that it was proposed at the meeting of the 1st August referred to above that, with a view to assisting you in your negotiations for a settlement at Henjam, you should be authorised to offer to the Persian Govern-ment certain docking and repair facilities for their warships in Indian ports. Unfortunately, however, it appears, from information subsequently received, that the Persian Government are negotiating for the acquisition in Italy of a floating dock, which, it is presumed, will be capable of holding the largest Persian ships. Moreover, there is already at Abadan a dock capable of taking the smaller vessels. Any offer of permanent docking facilities in India which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment could reasonably make is, therefore, unlikely to have any attraction for them. According to the latest information, however, the building of the new floating dock has not yet been begun, and the dock is therefore unlikely to be available in Persia for another eighteen months or two years, so that for the time being docking facilities outside Persia will be necessary at least for the Babr and Palang. Furthermore, it is as yet uncertain what repair facilities, as distinct from docking facilities, will be provided at Mohammerah even when the new dock is available.   It may be, therefore, that the Persian Government would be7202a   [9524a]
\grateful for an offer of temporary docking facilities and of permanent repair facilities in India such repair facilities being not only for the hull and machinery, but more especially for those portions of the equipment of a warship (such as the armament) which find no counterpart in a merchant ship and which must therefore be handled by specialist firms or by naval dockyards, of which the nearest to Persia is the Royal Indian Marine Yard at Bombay. The possibility of authorising you to make the Persian Government an offer of free repair facilities at Bombay up to some specified figure is still under consideration, but I hope to be able to send you definite instructions on this point in the near future.6. With regard to the question of the future headquarters of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, it has been found impracticable to adopt the suggestion, briefly discussed at the meeting which you attended on the 1st August, that, in return for a treaty article providing specifically for the continued maintenance of the Political Residency at Bushire, the Persian Government should be offered some part of the sum which would otherwise have been expended on its removal to Bahrein. The offer already made to the Persian Government to remove the Residency from Persian soil was coupled, as you know, with certain conditions which they have hitherto shown no disposition to accept. If, therefore, the Persian Government should revert to this question during the forthcoming treaty negotiations, you should remind them of these conditions, and intimate that they represent the minima desiderata of His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is the present intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the whole question of the possible removal of the Residency should, as far as possible, be allowed to lapse, and that, without any specific agreement having been reached with the Persian Government, the Resident should remain at Bushire, confining his functions, as in recent years, in so far as the Persian side of the Gulf is concerned, strictly to those of an ordinary consul-general. I am aware that there may be practical difficulties in carrying out this intention, and that, in particular, the Persian Government might, if they so wished, create serious difficulties over the issue of the necessary exequatur to each individual incumbent of the post. They have not, however, given any recent indication of interest in this question, and as it would clearly be impracticable to attempt to secure, without offering any quid pro quo, the consent of the Persian Government to a new treaty article providing specifically for the continued maintenance of the Residency at Bushire, there appears to be no alternative to the course indicated above.7. With regard to Article I (recognition and non-aggression), you have already, on my instructions, proposed to the Persian Government a text resembling in most respects that given in the relevant section of the accompanying memo-randum. Further discussion has now, however, revealed the need for the minor modifications which you will notice in the wording of the last paragraph of this article. The modifications, as you will see, are necessitated by constitutional considerations, and, while they are thus of importance from the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, there is no reason to anticipate that they will give rise to difficulties with the Persian Government.8. The position as regards Article III bis (abrogation of existing treaty engagements), is fully dealt with in the relevant section of the enclosed memo-randum. I hope shortly to be able to authorise you by telegraph to proceed in the manner outlined in paragraphs 7 to 9 of that section, but it has not yet been possible to reach a final decision on this question.9. You will recall that when the issues dealt with in this article were originally considered, it was contemplated that the conclusion of the Anglo-Persian Commercial Treaty would precede that of the General Treaty. Now, however, that this is no longer a practical possibility, it will in all probability be necessary to make special provision for the preservation of the most-favoured-nation rights, and of the right of consular representation, which have hitherto been enjoyed under Article 9 of the Anglo-Persian Peace Treaty of 1857. As this question will eventually be disposed of in the proposed Commercial Treaty, the most convenient temporary solution of the difficulty will be an exchange of notes, to be published with, and annexed to, the General Treaty, comprising a mutual assurance that, notwithstanding the abrogation of the Treaty of 1857 by virtue of Article III bis of the present Treaty, the provisions of Article 9 of the Treaty of 1857 shall remain in force until the conclusion of a new Anglo-Persian Commercial Treaty.     There should be no difficulty in inducing the Persian
Government to agree to such an exchange of notes since the rights and privileges involved are both temporary and reciprocal.10. As foreshadowed in the relevant section of the enclosed memorandum, the position now reached regarding the manner of providing for the continued use of Hen jam by His Majesty &apos;s ships will necessitate a modification of, or addition to, Article VI of the draft Treaty, which deals with the cession of the wireless telegraphy stations and material at Henjam, Bushire and Lingah. If you consider that the desired result could be achieved without serious opposition from the Persian Government by merely deleting the words &quot; . . . . le poste de T.S.F. a Hengam et . . . . &quot; from the Article itself, you should act accordingly. Alternative methods would be (i) a clause in the &quot; gentlemen&apos;s agreement&quot; providing for the continued use of the wireless station at Henjam by His Majesty&apos;s ships, or (ii) a separate exchange of notes containing a like provision and based on Article 8 of the now abandoned Henjam Protocol. Provided that the purport of that Article be effectively preserved, I am content to leave the manner of its preservation to your discretion.11. The position with regard to Article VIII (Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri) is still, essentially, as described in the relevant part of the enclosed memorandum. You will, however, have seen from recent telegrams exchanged between the India Office and the Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, that the possibility of the Persian Government making a serious effort to secure a long lease of Tamb may perhaps be somewhat less remote than was formerly supposed. Formal recognition by Persia in the Treaty of the ownership of Tamb and Abu Musa by the Jowasimi Sheikhs is one of the essential desiderata of His Majesty&apos;s Government. If, however, the Persian Government should desire to revive the question of leasing Tamb from the Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaimah, tlis Majesty&apos;s Government, while not anxious to encourage the Persian Government to adopt this course, would in such circumstances see no objection to it, subject to acceptance by the Persian Government of (1) the conditions laid down by the Sheikh, (2) a special provision, of the nature referred to in the relevant section of the memorandum regarding the maintenance of the Lighthouse, and (3) the further condition that no such lease can be actually granted by the Sheikh until the Persian Government have recognised, by virtue of the relevant treaty article, the Sheikh&apos;s claim to sovereignty over the island. His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that it should be left to the Persian Government to raise this question.12. As regards the Zahedan Railway, both the introductory article and the protocol suggested by Feroughi in his letter of the 17th September, 1931, are in general acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government, subject to the inclusion of the additional paragraph proposed by you in your reply of the 1st November, 1931. Certain formal alterations will, however, be required both in the Treaty article and in the protocol; you will see from the text given in Annex D of the relevant section of the memorandum what alterations are required.13. The detailed examination of the files relating to British claims against the Persian Government has only recently been concluded, and until the results of the examination have been carefully weighed it will not be possible to give you final instructions regarding this item of the treaty negotiations. I request, therefore, that in your discussions with the Persian Government you will defer the consideration of this question *asfc*l* pending further instructions.14. As regards the Debts Article (Article XII), His Majesty ^Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India are now willing that you should offer to the Persian Government, at the moment which you consider most -suitable and without prior reference to me or to the Government of India, the remission of the whole of the war and post-war debt. I transmit to you in this connexion a copy of a semi-official letter from His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, in which the suggestion, with which the Secretary of State for India agrees, is made that in order to enhance the value of this gesture you should, at the outset of your discussions, stipulate for the repayment of a sum considerably greater than that which has hitherto been understood by the Persian Government to represent the last word of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the subject. I request that you will give your careful consideration, to this suggestion, but His Majesty&apos;s Government are content to leave it to your discretion to handle the matter as you may think best.15. As regards the former Lighting and Buoying Article (Article IX), you will see from the relevant section of the memorandum that the suggestion has now
been made that a brief treaty article on this subject should be reinserted. Unless you see objection, you should endeavour to secure acceptance by the Persian Government of an article on the lines proposed. It is not, however, my wish that you should let this question stand in the way of an otherwise satisfactory settle-ment, and if the Persian Government raise strong objections to the article, you should let the matter drop.16. Finally, as regards the question of the various notes to be exchanged in connexion with the treaty, I would draw your attention to the remarks on this subject in connexion with Articles I and III bis in the enclosed memorandum. Although Feroughi at one period seems to have agreed with the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding the inadmissibility of secret notes, it nevertheless appears to be still somewhat doubtful whether the Persian Govern-ment fully understand the position, and from time to time certain observations of Feroughi and Teymourtache have seemed to suggest the belief that the notes to be exchanged would in some way be accorded less publicity than the main body of the treaty. I request, therefore, that, when discussing the various exchanges of notes which are contemplated, you will once more impress upon the Persian Government the fact that the notes in question can be given by His Majesty&apos;s Government no less publicity than the treaty itself, and will, of course, be no less binding.17. I realise with regret that, apart from the important question of Hen jam, the foregoing instructions provide you with little new material likely to influence the Persian Government in favour of accepting the Treaty as a whole. As you are aware, many possibilities have been carefully considered in this connexion only to be abandoned for financial or other reasons which it was impossible to override. The position is not, however, in all respects as it was when the treaty negotiations were suspended; there are indications that, in spite of certain recent serious incidents, the general attitude of the Persian Govern-ment and, in particular, of the Shah himself, towards a general settlement with this country has become more favourable since the settlement of the dispute with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Moreover, among the various instructions previously sent to you and referred to in the attached memorandum are some upon which you have not yet acted, and which have authorised you to make certain new concessions to the views of the Persian Government. I refer in particular to those dealing with Articles I, III and X, and possibly also (though here the position is still uncertain) to Article III bis. These articles are not, perhaps, comparable in importance to the others still in dispute, but each of them nevertheless represents a genuine concession on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, after prolonged argument, to the preferences and prejudices of the Persian Government. While, therefore, I do not under-estimate the difficulty of the task which lies before you, it is my hope that these small additional concessions (coupled with the remission, at the psychological moment, of the remainder of the war and post-war debts), and the new factor introduced by the direct and personal interest of the Shah himself, will prove sufficient to turn the scale and bring about a satisfactory settlement.

PROPOSED ANGLO-PERSIAN GENERAL TREATY.Position reached on January 17, 1934. Preamble.SA Majeste le Roi de Grande-Bretagne, d&apos;Irlande et des Territoires britanniques au dela des Mers, Empereur des Indes, ci-apres designe comme Sa Majeste le Roi, etSa Majeste&quot; Imperiale le Schah de Perse, ci-apres designe comme Sa Majeste Imperiale le Schah,D^sireux de renforcer les relations amicales existant entre eux, Ont resolu de conclure un traite&quot; a cet effet et ont nomme comme leurs plenipotentiaires :Sa Majeste&quot; le Roi de Grande-Bretagne, d&apos;Irlande et des Territoires britanniques au dela des Mers, Empereur des Indes,Pour la Grande-Bretagne et l&apos;Irlande du Nord :(A.B.) Pour l&apos;nde :(CD.)Sa Majeste Imp^riale le Schah. de Perse : (E.F.)Lesquels, apres s&apos;etre communique leurs pleins pouvoirs, trouv6s en bonne et due forme, sont convenus des dispositions suivantes.Note on Preamble.The Persians were believed to have no objection to an earlier text which differed only in the omission of the phrases in italics (in those days it was the intention to use the short title &quot; Sa Majeste britannique &quot; throughout the treaty) and in a few unimportant points of wording.Article I. Recognition and Non-Aggression.1. II y aura paix perpetuelle et amitie sincere entre les Hautes Parties Contractantes et leurs Successeurs respectifs.2. Chacune des Hautes Parties Contractantes, d&apos;accord avec les obligations lui incombant par suite du Pacte de la Societe des Nations et du Traite Multi-lateral pour la Renonciation a la Guerre, signe a Paris le 27 aout 1928, en vue egalement des anciens liens d&apos;amitie qui existent entre elles, s&apos;engage a respecter Tintegrite territoriale et 1&apos;independance politique de 1&apos;autre Haute Partie Contractante.3. Au paragraphs precedent, 1&apos;engagement fourni par Sa Majeste le Roi est donne tant en son propre nom qu&apos;au nom des Chefs d&apos;Etat, dont les relations conventionnelles avec Sa Majeste le Roi a la date de la signature du present traite&quot; ne permettent pas la cession de leurs territoires a une autre Puissance quelconque, et dont les noms seront communiques, au moment de la signature du present traite, par le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste&quot; le Roi dans le Royaume-Uni au Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Tmperiale le Schah. L&apos;engagement fourni par Sa Majeste&quot; Imp^riale le Schah s&apos;etend aux territoires sous la protection de Sa Majeste le Roi et aux territoires sous mandat exerce par le Gouvernement du Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d&apos;Irlande du Nord, ainsi qu&apos;aux territoires des Chefs d&apos;Etat mentionn^s ci-dessus.Notes on Article I.1. Apart from formal and grammatical amendments, and excluding the last sentence of paragraph 3 (regarding which see below), the text given above
is one proposed by Teymourtache himself (on the basis, of course, of earlier British drafts) in February 1932. Acceptance of it by His Majesty&apos;s Government is conditional on a suitable formula being found for the exchange of notes referred to, enumerating the Arab Sheikhs. There should, however, be no particular difficulty about the exchange of notes now that, after much argument, His Majesty&apos;s Government have finally consented to avoid mentioning the Sheikhs by name in the article itself. Teymourtache&apos;s objection to this was never clearly explained; this is what Sir R. Hoare said about it in his despatch No. 101 of the 24th February, 1932 : &quot; He is insistent that the names of the sheikhs covered by the article shall be included in an exchange of notes attached to the treaty, and not be mentioned in the treaty itself.&quot; Bearing in mind the contents of Mr. Henderson&apos;s despatch No. 77 of the 10th February, 1931, I pressed Teymourtache to give me a clear explanation of his objections to our original draft, in which the sheikhs were mentioned in the treaty itself. I did not fully understand his answer, but it was to the effect that, under the rules of procedure in the Majlis, the annexes to a treaty were not discussed by the full house; that being so, the article, as he wished it to read, would pass without difficulty, but, if the Sheikhs were mentioned in the article itself, an awkward debate might follow as the result of some member moving &apos; that the word Bahrein be omitted.&apos; &quot;The explanation seems unconvincing, if only because the whole text is obviously conditional on agreement being reached, elsewhere in the treaty, regarding the disputed territories such as Bahrein.2. In regard to the question whether the Persians agree to this exchange of notes being annexed to the treaty and published, cf. the notes attached to Article III below : it is fairly safe to say that they do agree in so far as this particular article is concerned.3. His Majesty&apos;s Minister has instructions to. submit a draft exchange of notes for the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government after discussion with the Persians. Annexed hereto is a draft exchange of notes which would be acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and which, it is intended, should form the basis of discussion. (This text is based on the one enclosed in Foreign Office despatch No. 77 of the 10th February, 1931, to Tehran, but it has been brought up to date as regards the King&apos;s title, and in various other respects; and at Sir R. Hoare&apos;s suggestion the order of the notes has been reversed.)4. The last sentence of paragraph 3 is new, and has yet to be submitted to the Persians. In the latest text sent to Sir R. Hoare there was, instead, another paragraph (paragraph 4), which read as follpws : -&quot; Au deuxieme paragraphe, 1&apos;engagement fourni par Sa Majeste Imperiale le Schah s&apos;etend aux territoires sous administration, protection ou mandat de Sa Majeste le Roi, ainsi qu&apos;aux Chefs d&apos;that  mentionnes au troisieme paragraphe.&quot;On reconsideration, the foregoing text was found to be inadequate for constitutional and formal reasons, and it is now replaced by the last sentence of paragraph 3. The alterations made should be a matter of indifference to the Persian Government.5. In addition to the above-mentioned minor modifications, it would perhaps be better on general principles for the phrase &quot; une tierce Puissance quelconque &quot; to be substituted for &quot; une autre Puissance quelconque &quot; both in the treaty article and in the relevant exchange of notes. The treaty relations here referred to, so far from precluding the cession of the territories concerned to His Majesty&apos;s Government, actually envisage this possibility, and the word &quot;autre&quot; is perhaps slightly ambiguous in this connexion. It may well be, however, that, at the stage now reached in the treaty negotiations, such a change could not be suggested without arousing Persian suspicions and making it more difficult to secure acceptance of the other points at issue. The change in question should not, there-fore, be attempted unless it is felt that no appreciable risk is involved. In so far as the Persian Government themselves are concerned, the present wording cannot be regarded as likely to give rise to misunderstandings, since they are in possession of actual copies of the treaties to which the passage refers.[9524] b 2

Article 111.  Visits of His Majesty&apos;s Ships to Persian Ports.Sa Majeste Imperiale le Schah accordera aux vaisseaux de guerre de Sa Majeste le Roi, y compris ceux de la Marine Royale des Indes, et aux vaisseaux de la flotte auxiliaire, dans les ports persans et dans les eaux territoriales persanes, et Sa Majeste le Roi accordera aux vaisseaux de guerre de Sa Majeste Imperiale le Schah dans les ports et dans les eaux territoriales du Royaume-Uni, des Indes et des colonies britanniques, les facilites et privileges consacres par 1&apos;usage international habituel.Exchange of Notes.(A) From the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty&apos;minister.M. le Ministre,Me referant a 1&apos;article III du Traite General signe en date de ce jour, j&apos;ai 1&apos;honneur de vous faire connaitre qiie le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Imperiale le Schah, reconnaissant la necessity pour les vaisseaux de guerre de Sa Majesty le Roi (y compris ceux de la Marine Royale des Indes), ainsi que pour les vaisseaux de la flotte auxiliaire, de pouvoir faire provision de combustible a Abadan, n&apos;a pas d&apos;objection a ce que ces vaisseaux fassent escale dans ce port, et que leurs equipes s&apos;y debarquent, moyennant un preavis adresse aux autorites competentes aussi longtemps que possible avant leur arrivee.2. II reste entendu que le sejour desdits vaisseaux a Abadan sera limite a un delai raisonnablement necessaire a leur but.3. Quant - a 1&apos;arrivee des vaisseaux de guerre de Sa Majeste le Roi (y compris ceux de la Marine Royale des Indes) et des vaisseaux de la flotte auxiliaire dans les autres ports persans, le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Imperiale le Schah desire qu&apos;une demande d&apos;autorisation lui soit adressee par la voie diplomatique. II conviendra que dans cette demande la date et la duree de la visite projetee soient indiquees, et que 1&apos;intervalle entre la date de la demande et celle de la visite soit suffisant pour permettre au Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Imperiale le Schah d&apos;exprimer son consentement ou son refus. Si, a la date fixee pour une telle visite, le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Imp6riale le Schah n&apos;aura pas communique sa decision en reponse a la demande lui adressee, 1&apos;autorisation demandee sera consideree comme accordee tacitement.4. II reste entendu egalement que si 1&apos;un des vaisseaux de guerre de Sa Majeste de Roi (y compris ceux de la Marine Royale des Indes) ou un vaisseau de la flotte auxiliaire arrive a un port persan sous les conditions pr6vues a. la fin du paragraphe precedent, les autorites competentes locales, pourvu qu&apos;elles n&apos;aient pas recu du Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Imperiale le Schah des instructions definitives interdisant la visite, ne feront pas d&apos;objection a ce que la visite ait lieu. Le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Imperiale le Schah se charge de donner des instructions dans ce sens aux autorites competentes locales des ports persans.Je saisis, &amp;c.-(B) From His Majesty&apos;s Minister to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. le Ministre,J&apos;ai 1&apos;honneur d&apos;accuser reception a votre Altesse/Excellence de la note suivante en date de ce jour :M. le Ministre,[Repeat in full.] En prenant acte de cette communication, je saisis, &amp;c.....Notes on Article III.1. It was agreed that the foregoing texts should only be put forward after His Majesty&apos;s Minister had made one more effort to secure acceptance of a system based on &quot;simple notification&quot;; and it was hoped that the procedure which was adopted by the Persian Government themselves in arranging the voyage of their new warships from Italy to the Persian Gulf might serve as a useful argument in favour of simple notification.2. Nothing like the procedure contemplated in the present exchange of notes has previously been proposed to the Persians.   It was only agreed to by
His Majesty&apos;s Government with considerable reluctance in 1932, and it should prove acceptable to the Persians while adequately guarding against the difficulties which would otherwise be caused by the lethargy of Persian officials.3. It is, of course, the firm intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government that these notes should be annexed to, and published with, the treaty. The intentions of the Persian Government, in so far as this particular article is concerned, are a trifle obscure. Feroughi at one period committed himself in writing to agreeing in general that &apos;&apos; secret&apos;&apos; notes were inadmissible; but, as indicated above, the present draft is the first which bridges the wide gulf that has hitherto separated the two parties in regard to this article; and, from the separate note annexed hereto, it will be clear that the insistence of His Majesty&apos;s Government on publication was, in fact, all that stood in the way of the Persians agreeing long ago to a system based on simple notification. -Fear of the Russians has, of course, been the difficulty in the past; but the Persians ought not to mind the publishing of the present text, which would give them adequate means of controlling the visits of Russian ships if the Soviet Government ever claimed corresponding treatment.4. It will be seen that the Arab Sheikhdoms are excluded from the scope of this arrangement: in respect of these Sheikhdoms something more than simple notification may prove necessary, and it was consequently agreed to deal with the procedure for visits to these Sheikhdoms quite separately from the Treaty.5. The wording of the treaty article itself is inevitably rather awkward, owing to the need for enumerating the various categories of British vessels covered. A definition of the &quot;auxiliary fleet&quot; was originally inserted, in order to allay an apprehension of Teymourtache&apos;s, in Article 3 of the proposed Henjam Protocol (see under Article IV, below). The Protocol having now been abandoned in favour of a brief &quot; gentlemen&apos;s agreement&quot; it may later be necessary to insert the definition of the auxiliary fleet in the present article, but the Persians could be left to raise this point themselves.Annex.Note on the Question whether the Persians have ever Agreed to the Publication of the Notes to be Exchanged in Connexion with Article 3 of the Treaty.(References are to Persia Print, Vol. XXIX.)P. 1 (from Sir R. Clive).&quot; I explained to His Highness that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not agree to any secret exchange of notes. He favoured the idea of an informal exchange of letters, after signature of the treaty, relating to visits of British warships to Persian ports by notification only, t said I would ascerain your-views.&quot;P. 33 (from Sir R. Clive).&quot;He wishes me to submit draft of informal letters to be exchanged about visits of ships by notification.&quot;P. 55 (from Sir R. Clive).&apos;&apos; With regard to Article 3, I will submit to you the draft of an informal letter on the subject of the visits of H.M. ships to Persian ports by notification only.&quot;P. 59 (from Foreign Office).&quot; I am not prepared to agree, at any rate for the present, to the proposal for an informal exchange of letters, which future Persian Governments might refuse to regard as valid. You should press the Persian Government strongly to agree to official notes, and submit drafts to me.&quot;P. 60 (from Sir R. Clive referring to this last).&quot; Minister for Foreign Affairs is quite prepared to give assurances we want . ... in formal exchange of notes, but would not agree to publication for fear of&quot; undesirable claims which Russians might make in the Caspian.&quot;
P. 71 gives the draft exchange of notes prepared by the Legation. P. 81 (Feroughi).&quot; La redaction de cet article .... etant acceptable, je vous prie de vouloir bien m&apos;envoyer le projet de note, relative a cet article, comme il a ete&quot; convenu entre nous.&quot;P. 130 (from Foreign Office).&quot; It is not clear to what extent you have been successful in impressing on the Persian Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to agree to any part of proposed general settlement being embodied in secret unpublishednotes.....While discussing with the Persians these .... notes you should bearin mind necessity for eventual publication in this country and registration at Geneva.....&quot;P. 167 (to Feroughi).&apos;&quot;&apos; Pour ce qui est de 1&apos;echange de notes relativement a cet article, je me permets de vous faire parvenir ci-joint un texte, base sur nos pourparlers les plus recents a ce sujet, qui vient d&apos;etre approuve par mon Gouvernement. . . .&quot;&apos;P. 172 (from Feroughi).&quot; Quant a la question des diverses notes supplementaires et 1&apos;opposition du Gouvernement britannique a 1&apos;idee d&apos;une entente secrete, qui sont incompatibles avec 1&apos;esprit de la Societe des Nations, je m&apos;empresse de rassurer votre Excellence que la Perse, etant membre de la Societe des Nations, egalement, et anim e de son esprit, n&apos;a aucune intention de contracter des ententes secretes. Toutes les notes supplementaires feront corps au traite et seront communiques a Geneve. En consequence et logiquement, la redaction de 1&apos;article lor du traite et les deux notes y relatives .... doivent etre considerees comme agreees par votre Governement.&quot;But in the same letter, several paragraphs on, he says : &apos;&apos; Quant aux notes relatives a 1&apos;article 3, la redaction proposee par la lettre du . . . . n&apos;est pas, a mon profund regret, acceptable. Mon Gouvernement prie le Gouvernement britannique de se contenter de la dispense de ses vaisseaux de guerre du permis d&apos;entree seulement dans le cas de 1&apos;entree desdits vaisseaux a Abadan, dans le but d&apos;approvisionnement en combustible, et dans les autres ports du Golfe, par suite d&apos;avarie. Dans ces cas rautorisation des autorites locales, prevenus par un preavis, sera suffisante.....&apos;&quot;&apos;P. 196 : Feroughi develops his reasons for this attitude, viz., Persian amour-propre, fear of Russian encroachments, &amp;c.P. 220 (from Sir R. Clive).&quot; I then mentioned visits of warships to Persian ports, and said you had been very surprised to learn that his Highness appeared to have gone back on the proposal which had in principle been more or less agreed to. He said that he could not accept the draft exchange of notes suggested, but he was prepared to authorise local Governors to allow the visit of ships duly notified in urgent cases without reference to Tehran.&quot;Article III bis. Abrogation of Existing Treaty Engagements.There never has been a definite British draft article on this subject. Annexed hereto will be found the Persian text put forward in August 1930, together with Feroughi&apos;s covering observations. His Majesty&apos;s Government had contemplated an article on the following lines :  &quot; From the date of the entry into force of the present treaty, and of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation also signed this day, between the High Contracting Parties, the following treaties, conventions and agree-ments between the two High Contracting Parties shall cease to be binding : 2. Here was to follow mention of the Peace Treaty of 1857, the Slavery ^Convention of 1882, the Commercial Convention of 1903, and the further
Commercial Agreement of 1920 (this last, which was never ratified, to be described, if necessary, as a subsequent modification of the 1903 Convention).3. With regard to the 1841 Treaty the decision was reached that its present validity was open to serious doubt, and that it would be useless to rely on it in any attempt to maintain the Political Resident at Bushire against the express wishes of the Persian Government. Consequently, it was decided that His Majesty&apos;s Minister should merely remind the Persians of its existence, and leave it to them to say whether it should be alluded to in the present article.&apos; 4. Prom the outset, however, the Persians set their faces against the British proposal. In doing so they appear to have been actuated by two main motives : (1) the view that certain instruments, such as the 1882 Slavery Convention, were incompatible with their national dignity and already for all practical purposes dead letters, and (2) the fear that if they agreed to anything less sweeping than an &apos;&apos; omnibus &quot; abrogation on the lines of their own draft, they might later find themselves still bound by the provisions of some forgotten agreement.5. As regards (1) it may be observed that in the most recent discussion with Teymourtache (in February 1932) on the subject of the Slavery Article itself, the ex-Minister of Court himself put forward a draft which mentioned the desire of the High Contracting Parties to conclude an agreement &quot; in place of the 1882 convention.&quot; If this convention can be mentioned once in the treaty, it can surely be mentioned twice.6. Motive (2) is much more serious, since in refusing to agree to an &quot;omnibus&quot; abrogation article, His Majesty&apos;s Government have, in fact, been actuated (apart from considerations of form) by the exactly opposite motive, namely, the fear that some forgotten agreement of value may thereby be Unintentionally swept away.7. Realising that these conflicting apprehensions had brought about a complete deadlock, the Foreign Office, after a careful review of the existing treaty instruments, came to the conclusion that it would in all probability be necessary to take the risk involved in accepting a general abrogation clause. They accordingly proposed, in their letter of the 27th September, 1932, to the India Office and Dominions Office (copies to Colonial Office and Admiralty) that Sir R. Hoare should be authorised to agree, in the last resort, to an article on the following lines (i.e., on the Persian model, but with the specific exclusion of frontier agreements) : &apos;&apos; Les Hautes Parties Contractantes conviennent que tous les traites. conventions et accords, n&apos;ayant pas trait aux questions des frontieres, conclus entre elles avant le 10 mai 1928(&apos;) seront considered comme abrogeV defmitivement a partir du depot des ratifications du present traite.&quot;8. This solution was not, however, to be resorted to until a further effort had been made to secure acceptance of the original proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and in particular the following two possible solutions were to be explored before resorting to the &quot; omnibus &quot; abrogation scheme : (a) the words &quot; shall cease to be binding &quot; (&quot; ne seront plus en vigueur &quot;) might, it was suggested, be abandoned in favour of &quot; auront cesse d&apos;etre en vigueur &quot;-which latter phrase does not indicate so precisely at what moment the instruments lapsed; or(b) the High Contracting Parties might admit their difference of opinion in some such clause as the following :-&quot;The High Contracting Parties, who have been unable to agree on the question of the actual validity of the following instruments, agree that they will no longer be in force after the entry into force of the present treaty.&quot;9. It may be noted that while (b), and possibly (a) also, meet the Persian objection referred to in paragraph 4 (1) above, neither of them meets the more serious objection in paragraph 4 (2).10. The Government of India have now signified their concurrence in the above-mentioned proposals of the Foreign Office, but certain points recently raised by the Dominions Office are still under consideration.11. When a decision has finally been reached regarding the form of the article, it will be necessary to draft, in consultation with the Dominions, anDate of the conclusion of the Anglo-Persian Tariff Autonomy Treaty.
exchange of notes putting on record their separate and several agreements to the abrogation of the treaty engagements involved.12. When the issues to be dealt with in this article were originally considered, it was supposed that the conclusion of the new commercial treaty would precede that of the general treaty. As this is no longer a practical possibility, it will be necessary to make special provision for the preservation of the most-favoured-nation rights, and of the right of consular representation, hitherto enjoyed under article 9 of the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1857. As this question will eventually be disposed of in the commercial treaty, the best plan seems to be an exchange of notes stating that notwithstanding the abrogation, under Article III bis of the 1857 treaty, the provisions of Article 9 of the latter shall remain in force until the conclusion of the new commercial treaty. There should be no difficulty in arranging for such an exchange of notes, since the matter is one which, in theory at any rate, affects both parties equally. (It might be supposed that an even better plan would be to exclude the whole of the 1857 treaty expressly from the general abrogation scheme &quot; pending the conclusion of the commercial treaty.&quot; This, however, is open to the serious objection that the remaining articles of the 1857 treaty.are very wounding to Persian susceptibilities.)Annex.Feroughi&apos;s draft.Sa Majeste&quot; britannique, souhaitant faciliter raccomplissement du d sir de Sa Majeste&quot; Imperiale le Schah de Perse de se liberer de toute obligation lui incombant du chef des traites, conventions et accords conclus entre leurs Etats anterieurement a 1&apos;annee 1928, exception faite pour les conventions telegraphiques qui feront 1&apos;objet d&apos;un accord separe&quot; entre les deux hautes parties contractantes., consent a les tenir pour abroges.Feroughi&apos;s covering observations.Vu que, sauf le traits de paix de 1857, la convention de 1882 relative a 1&apos;esclavage (sur laquelle le point de vue du Gouvernement persan vous est connu), la convention de 1903, 1&apos;accord de 1920 (non approuve par le Medjliss) et les conventions telegraphiques, il n&apos;y a pas, autant que nous sachions, d&apos;autres trait s, conventions et accords a abroger, et 1&apos;abrogation de ceux-ci resultant des traites conclus en 1928 ou a conclure a present, la redaction proposee sera facile-ment acceptable pour votre Gouvernement. Les conventions telegraphiques sont renvoyees par 1&apos;article meme a un accord special.Article IV Henjam.Note. For the sake of completeness, the latest British texts of the Article and Protocol actually put forward to the Persians are annexed hereto. Almost every one of the articles of the Protocol was, however, rejected by the Persians before the treaty negotiations broke down in 1930, and in September 1932 they attempted to remove this vital question altogether from the scope of the treaty by demanding the immediate evacuation of the depot.&apos; 2. In August 1933 it was decided that Sir R. Hoare should endeavour to secure the consent of the Persian Government to a &quot;gentlemen&apos;s agreement &quot; (as part of the general treaty settlement), by which His Majesty&apos;s ships should be permitted to continue in the enjoyment of their present facilities at Henjam for as long a period as possible, but in any case for not less than twenty-five years.Annex.

Note on Article V.Previous drafts of the second paragraph provided for the visits of British inspectors at stated intervals, and the question gave rise to a lot of trouble. The present redraft of paragraph 2 is Teymourtache&apos;s own, and His Majesty&apos;s Minister has authority to accept it.Article VI. Wireless Stations.Sa Ma jest6 le Roi cedera d^finitivement a Sa Majeste imperiale le Schah le poste de T.S.F. a Hengam et tous les appareils de radiotelegraphie aux stations de Bouchir et de Lingah a, partir de la date de 1&apos;entree en vigueur du present traite\Notes on Article VI.1. This article has, of course, been agreed to by the Persians, but a new problem has since been created by the abandonment of the Henjam Protocol (see under article 4), article 8 of which provided for the lease of the Henjam wireless station to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Unless (which seems unlikely) it is possible to secure the omission from the treaty article of the words &quot; le poste de T.S.F. a Hengam et . . . .,&quot; the best method will probably be an exchange of notes based on article 8 of the old Henjam Protocol (q.v. above). The same result would be achieved by a special clause, to the same effect, in the new &quot; gentlemen&apos;s agreement&quot;; but the essence of that agreement is that it should be brief and general.2. Both at the time of the conclusion of the Telegraphs Agreement and later, the Persian Government endeavoured unofficially to secure the handing over of these wireless stations in advance of a general treaty settlement.Article VII. Bahrein.1. Sa Majeste imp^riale le Schah et Sa Majeste&quot; le Roi se mettent d&apos;accord pour reconnaitre 1&apos;independance de Bahrein et les droits souverains du Cheik regnant.2. Sa Majeste le Roi convient, au nom du Cheik de Bahrein, que les sujets de Sa Majeste imperiale le Schah auront sur les iles de Bahrein pleine protection pour leurs personnes, droits et biens, ainsi que le droit de s&apos;y livrer au commerce et a 1&apos;industrie dans les conditions accordees aux ressortissants de la nation la plus favorisee, pourvu que les ressortissants de Bahrein aient la meme protection en Perse et le droit de s&apos;y livrer au commerce et a 1&apos;industrie dans ces memes conditions.Notes on A rticle VII.1. Paragraph 1, which is acceptable to the Persian Government, is only acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government if a satisfactory formula is found for article 1 of the Treaty.2. Paragraph 2 is Teymourtache&apos;s redraft (slightly modifying an earlier British version) as proposed to Sir R. Hoare in February 1932, and His Majesty&apos;s Minister has authority to accept it.3. The Persian acceptance of the whole article is, of course, dependent on agreement being reached regarding their claim for compensation : His Majesty&apos;s Government do not admit the justice of the claim, and no agreement is in sight.A rticle VIII. Tamb, A bu Musa, S-irri.Les Hautes Parties Contractantes, dans 1&apos;interet des relations amicales qui existent si heureusement entre elles, sont d&apos;accord pour considerer comme regies sur la base du statu quo tous les differends survenus entre elles au sujet de la souverainete sur certaines iles dans le golfe Persique autres que celles mentionnees aux articles V(2) et VII(a) du present traite. Est reconnue notamment la souverainete de Sa Majeste imperiale le Schah sur File de Sirri, et celle des Cheiks Jowazimi d&apos;Oman sur les iles de Tomb (avec Nabiyou-Tomb) et d&apos;Abou-Moussa.(*) l.o., Basidu and Bahrein: these references will have to be altered when the treaty articles xire finally renumbered.
Notes on Article VIII.1. Barring certain amendments of wording which do not affect the sense, and the omission dealt with in paragraph 6 below, this is the original British draft. The latter is given in the annex, as it has so long held the field. It has never been discussed in detail from the drafting point of view, since until the treaty negotiations broke down in the summer of 1930 the Persians steadfastly refused to consider even provisionally the abandonment of their claim to Tamb and Abu Musa.2. As regards Abu Musa, Teymourtache in October 1930 offered to abandon the Persian claim if Persia were given Tamb. Sir R. Clive refused to discuss this suggestion, as the Sheikh of Ras-el-Khaimah (the owner of Tamb, but not of Abu Musa), refused to part with his island at any price, and His Majesty&apos;s Government could not surrender to Persia what was not theirs.3. At a later stage Teymourtache said that his Government might be content with a long lease of Tamb, the Sheikh keeping his garden on the island [subsequent investigation showed that there was no garden] and enjoying exemption from customs dues [the Sheikh, however, never resides on the island]. He suggested a fifty-year lease^ the Sheikh to be paid whatever His Majesty5s Government paid for the lease of Henjam. Eventually, as a result of this suggestion, the Sheikh was approached in the spring of 1931, and furnished the Residency Agent with a statement of the terms on which he would be willing to lease his island (see Annex II). The terms, it will, be seen, are unlikely to appeal to the Persians. The Admiralty suggested certain alterations which would render the terms slightly more palatable while not weakening their practical effect, but the matter was not pursued further. The Sheikh stated, however, in September 1933 that he had received &quot; from Tehran &quot; a, letter concerning the iease of Tamb by the Persian Government. Whether there is any truth in this is not yet known; he stated that he had not answered the letter.4. If it ever becomes possible to reach a solution on these lines, special provision will have to be made for exempting the lighthouse staff from Persian customs dues both on their personal effects and on official stores, and from the necessity of obtaining visas (the nearest Persian consuls are at Basra and Karachi) when arriving at or leaving the island.5. It is not certain whether, in putting forward the offer referred to in paragraph 3 above, Teymourtache did or did not throw into the bargain the abandonment of the Persian claim to Abu Musa. Probably he did not (two accounts by Sir R. Clive are conflicting in this respect), but in any case, as Teymourtache is no longer in power, and his offer was an oral one, the whole question would have to be taken up again from the beginning.6. The reference to Henjam in line 7 of the original British draft (see Annex I) must have been due to some misunderstanding, as, of course, there has never been any dispute regarding the sovereignty of Persia over that island.Annex I.Original British draft.Les Hautes Parties Contractantes, dans 1&apos;interet des relations amicales ^actuellement si heureusement existantes entre elles, sont d&apos;accord pour regarder comme reglees par ces pr^sentes sur la base du statu quo actuel toutes questions pendantes quant a la souverainete sur certaines iles dans le golfe Persique autres que celles mentionn es dans les articles .... (Hengam, Bassidou, Bahrein) du present traite\ Sont reconnues notamment la souverainete de Sa Majeste imperiale le Schah sur 1&apos;ile de Sirri et celles des Cheiks Jowazimi d&apos;Oman sur les iles de Tamb (avec Nabiyou-Tamb) et d&apos;Abou-Moussa.Annex II.Statement of the Conditions required by the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah for a - *&apos; Lease of Tamb to the Persian Government.. Firstly, my flag, the Qasemi, and my representative should remain in the island as before. .
2. My subjects in the island should not be subjected to high-handedness or Oppression, and no orders should be enforced in their case until due reference has. been made to me and the case discussed with me.3. The Persian Governments ships which do inspection on behalf of their customs should not come to the &apos;0man Sea to search Arab dhows, whether belonging to my subjects or to those of my neighbours, the Trucial sheikhs; and the sea should remain free as before for sailing-boats. Should goods prohibited by the Persian Government be found in a sailing-boat belonging to my subjects, the Persian Government should refer the matter to the British Government, and the latter should negotiate with me regarding the sailing-boat and her crew. The Persian Government should not execute their orders direct in regard to the boat.4. If an indebted diver takes refuge with the Persian official residing in the island he should return him to me without refusal when I ask him. to do so.5. If any merchandise be imported into the island for my personal require-ments, also if the inhabitants of the island import foodstuffs for their use, no duty should be levied on it.6. The annual rental should be paid to me in advance in the beginning of every year.7. If the Persian Government decides to fix any flagstaff for their official in the island it should be on the top of the house and not on land.8. These conditions should be enforced under the purview and supervision of the British Government between me and the Persian Government.[Article IX.]Article IX: Lighting and Buoying in the Persian Gulf.This was removed at an early stage and by common consent from the scope of the general treaty, and the question will, it is hoped, be dealt with in the proposed Tripartite Convention relating to the Shatt el-&apos;Arab.2. The India Office have, however, recently suggested that an attempt might be made to secure the reinsertion of a brief treaty article, to the effect that the High Contracting Parties will deal with the question of lighting and buoying by means of a separate agreement. This, they suggest, might make it easier to reach agreement later with regard to the Shatt el-&apos;Arab Conservancy Board project; alternatively, if this project failed, or if His Majesty&apos;s Government were for any reason to decide to let it drop, such an article might still make it easier to press the Persian Government, at a later stage, to agree to the co-ordination of lighting and buoying arrangements in the Persian Gulf.3. In view of certain recent indications that the Persian Government intend to go their own way in the matter of lighting and buoying, and that they regard the Conservancy Board project as inadequate, it may well prove impossible to secure the insertion of such a treaty article at this stage; but there seems no harm in making the attempt provided that the question is not allowed to stand in the way of an otherwise satisfactory settlement.  The article might run as follows  -&quot;Les Hautes Parties Contractantes s&apos;entendront, dans un accord special a survenir apres la conclusion du present traite, sur la question des. phares et bouees dans le golfe Persique et dans les eaux avoisinantes.&quot;Article X.

The differences between versions 1 and 2 will be seen to be of a purely formal nature. Version 1 gives the instrument which is referred to in the treaty article a more or less independent existence from that of the treaty as a whole,, and it is, indeed, preferable that, if version 1 is finally selected, the word &quot; Protocol &quot; should be replaced by &quot; Convention &quot; wherever it occurs. Version 2 is suitable for a genuine protocol forming an integral part of the general treaty.2. Politically speaking, there is little to choose between the two versions. His Majesty&apos;s Government were at one time quite prepared to regulate the-slavery question by means of an altogether separate convention, and the quasi-independent character of version 1 does not, therefore, present any difficulty. Sir R. Hoare was left full discretion which to put forward first. He has not yet had the opportunity of proposing either, but the present two versions do not differ in any essential point from a version (based on an earlier British draft) which was suggested by Teymourtache himself in February 1932, and there should therefore be no difficulty in securing agreement.3.   The words &quot;la pratique de,&quot; which are in square brackets in the preamble to both versions of the Protocol, are redundant, but not otherwise objec-tionable.   Teymourtache suggested &quot; pratique &quot; instead of &quot; recrudescence &quot; for-some reason of prestige which has not been clearly explained.
4. It should be noted that the words &quot; . . . . de 1&apos;esclavage et . . . &quot; which appeared in the fourth line of Article 4 in the version already authorised; have now been deleted. The word &quot; esclavage &quot; does not appear in the treaty article or in the preamble to the protocol, and as the agreement refers only to maritime control, &quot;la traite&quot; is sufficient. There is, too, a danger that the Persians might otherwise claim an interest in the internal affairs of the Arab Sheikhdoms.5.   Note also that in article 4, line 3, &quot; et &quot; has been replaced by &quot; ou dans.&quot;A rticle XI. Zaheclan (Duzdap) Railway.1. A final decision regarding the wording of the treaty article and protocol was not reached till mid-January 1934; the text then adopted will be found in Annex D below.2. The attached copies of correspondence between His Majesty&apos;s Repre-sentatives at Tehran and the Persian Minister for Poreign Affairs show the previous history of the question in sufficient detail. Briefly, in October 1930, when the negotiations were on the point of breaking down, Sir R. Clive submitted to Feroughi a memorandum outlining the British terms (the actual wording of this memorandum, it may be noted, had not been approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government). No notice was taken of the memorandum until September 1931, when the Persians, inconvenienced by the closure of the railway in June of that year, intimated their acceptance of the British proposals, in the hope of securing the immediate reopening of the railway in advance of a treaty settlement. In announcing this acceptance of &quot; the tenor of the British memorandum,&quot; Feroughi put forward a French draft of his own which, though corresponding in essentials to Sir R. Clive&apos;s terms, contained certain omissions and alterations of secondary importance. On the 1st November, 1931, Sir R. Hoare sent Feroughi a reply, in which he took note of the Persian acceptance of the British proposals, and stated that, notwithstanding the altered conditions then obtaining, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to regard the. proposals &quot;as constituting an agreement to come into force as part of a wider settlement,&quot; subject to one minor addition, viz., a paragraph providing for&apos; reasonable notice to be given in the event of either party wishing to increase the freight rates and fares on their section of the stretch between Zahedan and Nushki. No mention was made of Feroughi&apos;s draft in this reply.3. The Persian Government have made repeated efforts to secure the reopening of the railway in advance of the treaty settlement. The only occasion on which His Majesty&apos;s Government responded to these advances was in August 1931, when an offer was made to reopen the railway in exchange for a prolongation of the permission accorded to Imperial Airways, Limited, to use the South Persian route.  This offer was not accepted by the Persians.4. Meanwhile, at Sir R. Hoare&apos;s suggestion, the Government of India recently furnished His Majesty&apos;s Legation with a draft contract for the purchase by the Persian Government of the necessary railway material, and this contract was in due course communicated to the Railway Department at Tehran (who had asked for it in December 1932) with a covering intimation that delivery could be effected within a stated period from the conclusion of an agreement for the transfer of the Persian section of the line.Annex.   ,(A) Sir R. Clivers Aide-memoire of October 1, 1930. Mon cher Ministre,Je nrempresse de vous faire parvenir ci-joint F aide-memoire au sujet du chemin de fer de Dozdab que je vous ai promis lors de notre conversation du 29 septembre. En le parcourant, vous vous rendrez compte des grands sacrifices que mpn Gouvernement est pret a faire pour regler, une fois pour toutes, cette question difficultueuse. Vous conviendrez, j&apos;en suis persuade, que les nouvelles propositions dont il s&apos;agit fournissent la preuve la plus concluante de sa volonte d&apos;aboutir.Pour ce qui est de la forme que doit revetir Vaccord.,.a ce sujet, mon Gouvernement est nettement de 1&apos;avis qu&apos;un article concis dans le Traite general,[9524] d
tel qu*il a ete envisage precedemment, serait de beaucoup preferable a un instrument special quelconque, et je me plais a esperer que votre Altesse sera d&apos;accord.Veuillez, &amp;c.R. H. CLIVE.A ide-memoire.Par sa lettre en date du 5 juillet 1930 son Altesse le Ministre des Affaires etrangeres a bien voulu exposer au Ministre de Sa Majeste britannique le point de vue du Gouvernement imperial sur la question du chemin de fer de Dozdab. Les autorites competentes du Gouvernement de Sa Majeste britannique ont examine soigneusement le contre-projet que contenait cette lettre, et bien que son acceptation ne pourrait manquer d&apos;entrainer pour le Gouvernement des Indes une perte materielle tres considerable, elles se sont declarees pretes, dans le but d&apos;assurer une solution definitive de cette question difficultueuse, a prendre le document precite comme base et point de depart aux negociations ulterieures sous reserve dfes observations suivantes :1. La periode de douze ans pendant laquelle, d&apos;apres les termes du contre-projet persan, le Gouvernement des Indes serait tenu d&apos;operer la ligne jusqu&apos;a la frontiere persane, semble excessive lorsqu&apos;on se rend compte du fait que le Gouvernement persan se refuse de partager les depenses considerables qui seraient faites de ce chef. En vue de ce refus, le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste britannique prefere reduire a cinq ans la periode dont il est question.2. Le Gouvernement de Sa Majesty britannique est pret, des maintenant, a ceder gratuitement au Gouvernement persan la partie de la ligne entre Mirdjawa et Dozdab, pour etre operee par ce dernier, et k soumettre des propositions pour un accord tendant a regler le mouvement entre les deux sections. II est pret, egalement, a negocier la vente au Gouvernement persan du materiel roulant necessaire a 1&apos;exploitation de la section persane.3. Pour le cas ou le Gouvernement persan entreprendrait ou laisserait entreprendre sur son territoire la construction d&apos;une voie ferree quelconque qui tombe, a 1&apos;avis du Gouvernement de Sa Majeste britannique, sous le coup de 1&apos;article 1&quot;&apos;&apos;, paragraphe 2, du contre-projet persan,(3) le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste britannique se reserve une entiere liberte d&apos;action quant a la partie de la iigne qui se trouve sur son territoire et reclame notamment le droit -non seulement de cesser 1&apos;exploitation, mais aussi d&apos;enlever les rails.4. Ainsi qu&apos;il a ete indique plus haut, le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste britannique est pret a supporter seul la totalite des depenses qui seront faites du chef de 1&apos;exploitation de la section Mirdjawa-Dalbandin. II y a lieu de faire remarquer que cette perte a ete value en lieu competent a un montant annuel d&apos;environ  60,000.

This memorandum, of which a copy was sent to ypur Lprdship&apos;s predecessor in Sir Egbert Cliye&apos;s despatch no. 488 pf the 6th October, 1930, enumerated the conditions upqn which the Government of India would, as a part &quot;of the general treaty settlement which was then contemplated, he prepared to transfer to the Persian Government the section of the Quetta-Duzdab Eailway situated on Persian territory.2. Feroughi&apos;s letter contains what are in effect five draft articles and your Lordship will observe that they reproduce in all material points the conditions enumerated in the memorandum. There is no article corresponding to section 4, which dwelt on the fact that the Government of India would make a considerable sacrifice by continuing to bear the loss incurred on the operation of the railway between Mirjawa and Dalbandin, but this was hardly to be expected. A small point which may be noted is that in article 2. &quot; la frontiere &quot; is substituted for &quot;Mirdjawa&quot; as the point from which the line will be transferred, jbp the Persian Government. Article 2 also contemplates the relegation to future agreements of two questions (the connexion between the Indian and Persian sections and the price to be paid by the Persian Government for Indian rolling-stock) both of which might in practice prove difficult to negotiate.    . - - .3. I shall be glad to learn, whether, apart from the considerations which I discuss in the following paragraphs, these articles are in general still acceptable jo His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India, and whether they see any objection, to the articles forming a protocol to be attached to the treaty and covered by a single article in the treaty. The articles obviously need some rearrangement and the language needs some revision as regards style and accuracy, but these points need not be considered at this juncture. They will also need to be supplemented by the article relative to the fixing of rates and fares which the Government of India desire to add. to their earlier conditions (see Government of India telegram No. 1769 S of the 16th July to the India Office)......Mon cher Charge d&apos;Affaires,Comme voiis le savez, son Excellence Sir Robert Clive m&apos;a adresse, en date du lor octobre 1930, une lettre contenant certaines propositions relatives au chemin de fer de Dozdab.

A. FEROUGHI.(C) Sir R. Hoare&apos;s reply of November 1, 1931. My dear Minister,In your letter of the 17th September to Mr. Dodd your Highness was good enough to state that the Imperial Government accepted the tenor of the aide-memoire regarding the Duzdab Railway which was communicated to your Highness by Sir Robert Clive in his letter of the 1st October, 1930.I am now authorised to inform your Highness, in reply, that the closure of the Duzdab Railway, as the result of material conditions outside the control of the Indian Railway Administration, has completely altered the circumstances in which Sir Robert Clive&apos;s aide-memoire was communicated to your Highness. Nevertheless, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Govern-ment of India will be prepared to regard the terms of that aide-memoire, upon which they note with satisfaction that both parties are agreed, as constituting an agreement to come into force as part of a wider settlement.I take this opportunity of mentioning that the Government of India desire to add to the paragraphs quoted by your Highness a paragraph on the following lines : &quot;During the continuance of this agreement neither party shall make any alteration in their rates and fares over the section of the railway between Nushki and Duzdab without giving to the other party three months&apos; notice or such shorter notice as may be mutually agreed upon.&quot;This addition can. however, be considered at a later date.R.

The salient points are the following : 1. In 1926 Feroughi, then Prime Minister, agreed in writing on the sum of  2,000,000 as that part of Persia&apos;s total debt to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India (amounting, in fact, to well over  5,000,000) which she could properly be called upon to pay.   Included in the
2 million was the pre-war debt of-  490,000, op which Persia had always paid interest, and which she finally repaid in June 1933.2. This agreement was, however, subject to ratification, and the Persian Government made no attempt to obtain Majlis approval. Teymourtaehe always maintained that the sums advanced to Persia during and immediately after the war were spent in British rather than Persian interests, and should be-regarded as British war expenditure. There is, it must be admitted, a good deal to be said for this view, and in practice there is no likelihood whatever of the Persians ever consenting to repay any part of this debt.3. In January 1930 the Persians were informed in writing that His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to reduce the total debt from two to One million pounds as part of a satisfactory general settlement (&quot;. . . . con-cessions .... que mon Gouvernement est pret a octroyer dans le but de realiser un accord defiriitif &quot;-see Sir R. Clive&apos;s despatch No. 80 of the 22nd February, 1930).4. In April 1930 Teymourtache &quot;expressed great disappointment at the offer to renounce only one million. He had counted on our renouncing the whole two million of the debt, besides providing ships and abandoning claims.&quot; After further discussion, he was informed orally by Sir R. Clive that, &quot; if the Persian Government were prepared to pay a reasonable sum in settlement . . . .&quot; (i.e., of British claims) &quot;. . . . His Majesty&apos;s Government might be willing to forgo a further amount of debt, excluding always the  490,000 of pre-war debt&apos;&apos; (Tehran telegram No. 28 of the 2nd April, 1930). [Note. It is probable that when pressing, on this occasion, for the remission of &quot; the whole two million,&quot; Teymourtache had overlooked that the pre-war debt was included in this sum.] The proposal was never further pursued.5. Hitherto instructions to His Majesty&apos;s Minister have been that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not be committed as regards the remainder of the war and post-war debt. It has, however, long been realised by His Majesty&apos;s Government that before a satisfactory treaty settlement can be obtained this remaining  510,000 will almost certainly have to be remitted, and it has now been decided to give His Majesty&apos;s Minister full discretion to make the offer of its remission at the moment which he considers most suitable and without prior reference to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom or the Government of India.Article XIII. Claims.1.   No British draft has yet been submitted to the Persians. 2.   In February 1932 Teymourtache proposed the following : Les Hautes Parties Contractantes sont convenues de regler les reclama-tions existantes des sujets de Tune des parties a 1&apos;egard du Gouvernement de 1&apos;autre par un protocole qui sera signe entre leurs representants respectifs ou la modalitd de 1&apos;examen, la resolution du differend concernant ladite reclamation et sa liquidation seront indiquees.3. In putting forward this draft, Teymourtache said that what he had in mind was the establishment of a claims commission and the definition of the commission^ functions.4. The obvious objection to. the draft from the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government is that it relegates the whole process to the indefinite future. The protocol (if a protocol rather than an annex is finally decided on) will have to be agreed on before the conclusion of the treaty, and will presumably be annexed thereto.5. As regards the terms of the covering article andprotocol (or annex), several drafts have been considered by the Foreign Office, His Majesty&apos;s repre-sentatives at Tehran and, more recently, by the other Departments concerned. Annexed hereto is (A) the text of the most recent draft to be circulated in full, semi-officially, to the Treasury and India Office, (B) a list of alterations and corrections arising out of subsequent semi-official correspondence and further independent discussion at the Foreign Office, and (C) a revised draft, giving the presumed latest form of the article and annex, but incorporating certain passages, not yet finally agreed to by the other Departments, concerned.
6. In recent months the looming up of the Persian &quot; Atychides &quot; (alias &quot; Hamadan,&quot; alias &quot;Kara Deniz &quot;) claim, and certain reports received from Tehran to the effect that the Persians were known to be busy concocting large numbers of counter-claims for the war period, led the Foreign Office to reconsider the whole question afresh, and to conclude that before reaching any final decision regarding the text of the claims article and annex it would be necessary for an expert to re-examine in detail all outstanding British claims and weed out the large number which, it is believed, are hopelessly unsound. The files containing these are at present being investigated in the Foreign Office.Annex.(A) Latest Complete Text Circulated to the Departments concerned.Draft Article XIII.Each of the High Contracting Parties, recognising the exceptional circum-stances obtaining during the world war, agrees not to pursue against the other claims, not being in respect of contractual obligations, which were directly due to those circumstances and which arose out of acts done or events taking place between the dates of the 4th August, 1914, and the 22nd February, 1921.2.

Revised draft of paragraph 1 of the Treaty article (as suggested to Mr. Trickett in Mr. C. Warner&apos;s letter of the 25th June, 1932) : &quot; Each of the High Contracting Parties, recognising the exceptional circumstances obtaining during the world war, agrees not to pursue against the other claims, other than those in respect of contractual obligations, which were directly due to those circumstances and which arose out of acts done or events taking place between the dates of the 4th August, 1914, and the 22nd February, 1921.&quot;2.

If sums are payable under the awards of the tribunal by the Governments of both High Contracting Parties, the said payments shall be made by both Governments on the same date and at the same time.&quot;3. Tentative draft of an additional paragraph to the Treaty article (as suggested to Mr. Laithwaite in Mr-Warner&apos;s letter of the 20th January, 1933): &quot;Each of the High Contracting Parties agrees not to pursue against the other any claim arising out of events taking place before the 1st January, 1928, and not formally(&apos;) presented to the Government of the other High : Contracting Party before that date.&quot;This suggested addition has not, however, received the final approval of the other Departments concerned. On the assumption that it is eventually approved, the most up-to-date text of the treaty article and annex would read as follows : (4) Mistyped as &quot; provisionally &quot; in the letter in question.

Clive, Teymourtache made it quite clear at one stage that his Government regarded the Residency as one of those regrettable survivals which stood in the way of a general improvement in Anglo-Persian relations. Eventually, therefore, His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India gave their consent, in principle and
subject to certain important conditions,Ho-the-transfer; 6&apos;f&apos;the Residericy as part -Of a general settlement. y &apos;   v &apos; - 1 -       -carrier 2. &apos; In September 1930 Sir R. Olive; hi the hope of reviving1 arid clinching the treaty negotiations at a moment when they seemed oil the point of breaking down, spontaneously suggested to Feroughi the possibility of a concession subjeot to these conditions, arid followed up&quot;his^&quot;suggestion-by; the letter of which the relevant part is annexed..! Briefry,.the; proposal was for ah exchange of notes in which His Majesty&apos;s- G^vfetoHie^3^M(i^^p)fK^70ofn^-tn6?- conclusion&apos; of&apos; the General treaty, their decision to remove the Residency to a site outside Persia as soon as the necessary arrangements could be made and provided that the Resident were allowed unrestricted access on all occasions to British consular posts in the Persian ports of the Gulf; and the Persian Government, in their turn, would signify their acceptance of the conditions attached to this decision;3. Owing to the ensuing breakdown of the negotiations, the Persian Government did not at once react to this proposal save in the form of a brief and vague expression of thanks on the part of Feroughi. In a conversation with Sir R. Hoare in March 1932, Teymourtache and Feroughi even alleged that, they had never received Sir R. Clive&apos;s letter, though it was subsequently proved that they had. On that occasion Teymourtache made it clear that he regarded the indefinite continuance of the present arrangements as a lesser evil than the removal of the Residency coupled with the conditions which had been proposed, i.e., that the Resident should have the unrestricted right to tour the South Persian consulates from a base outside Persia. He put forward a new suggestion of his own,&apos;to the effect that the Resident might spend the summer at Bushire and the rest of the year on the Arab coast, provided that while at Bushire his political functions in matters. relating to the Arab sheikhdoms were performed by corres-pondence and did not entail constant visits of His Majesty&apos;s Ships for political consultations. (If may be rioted that these.two provisos are, in fact, already Observed by the Resident see paragraph 7 below.)4. The whole question of the conditions to be imposed before consenting to the removal of the Residency was re-examined by the Foreign Office in April 1932, and in Mr. RendeTs semi-official letter to Mr. Donaldson of the&apos; 29th April it was suggested that further consideration should be given to the possibility of waiving the previous insistence of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the rights of the Resident as &quot;Inspecting Consul-General.&quot; Owing, it is understood, to the ensuing uncertainty as to the fate of the treaty negotiations as a whole, no reply was received to Mr. Renders letter. , , *5. In November 1932, in connexion with the Persian demand for the evacuation of Henjam, the following suggestion was made in the course Of an interdepartmental discussion :  -&quot;Mr. Grieve and Mr. Laithwaite both thought that if, in addition to retaining our naval depot at Henjam and so avoiding the expenditure involved in providing alternative accommodation at Bahrein, there were a chance of saving the expense likely to be incurred in transferring the Political Residency at Bushire to the Arabian coast, which, from the informa-tion available, appeared likely to be not less than  100,000, we might be justified in considering not only the remission of the balance of the war and post-war debt, but possibly the payment in addition of a lump sum, the amount of which should not exceed something in the neighbourhood of  100,000.&quot;6. The Persian demand for the evacuation of Henjam was not pressed during the succeeding months, and as a result of the difference of opinion between the Foreign Office and the India Office regarding the expediency of resuming the treaty negotiations, at all, the foregoing suggestion regarding the Bushire Residency remained in abeyance until August 1933. It was then taken up afresh by the Foreign Office, but it was found that there were insuperable objections to the proposal. Not only was it clear that there would be embarrassing difficulties about showing such a lump-sum payment in the public accounts; but the India Office, on further consideration, were unable to agree to the proposal even in principle, arid apart from these mechanical difficulties. They tOok. the line that while in the financial conditions then obtaining the estimated cost of the transfer of the Residency was prohibitive, they saw no necessity to pay even a part of this sum in order to avoid the transfer;, the Persian Government had shown hodisposi-[9524] V
mtion tq accept the CG^itionsvpn/whichiH.is;Majesty&apos;SssGovernment had agreed to move the Residency, and unless they did so it would, the India Office thought, be possibles ;and \preferable., to, prolong- indefinitely-the ^existing position of the Resident; letting the question drop as -far. as.-the-: treaty, was concerned: The proposed abolition of the treaty of 1841&apos;.would, create no new situation, since that treaty was in all:probability to: beregarded- .ash already invalid (cf: the notes attached ;to Article III bis; above),, and the; Resident had for several years past performed, as far as/his,P^rsj^^ than the ordinaryfunctions of a Cbnsul-General. He was not more often visited at Bushire by British warships than his consular successor would be in the event of the Residency being transferred to Bahrein, and when he proceeded, to the Arabian coast he generally embarked in a mail steamer at Bushire, transferring at sea to a British warship. Provided, therefore, that the general right of consular repre-sentation enjoyed by His Majesty&apos;s Government under article 9 of the treaty of 1857 were preserved (see in this connexion paragraph 12 of the notes to Article III his), the India Office saw no reason why the Residency should not be maintained indefinitely at Bushire.7. In discussing this question the Foreign Office gave it as their view that, notwithstanding the separation between the functions of the Resident in his Persian and Arabian spheres of activity, the Persian Government would in practice have a reasonable case if they should at any time choose to object to the continued presence of the Resident in their territory. There was no exact parallel elsewhere, since, although the functions of the Resident on the Arabian coast might technically be described as &quot;representative,&quot; it was well known that in practice they were very far from corresponding to ordinary consular or diplomatic duties. Since, however, there had been various indications that the Persian Government had lost interest in the question, it was decided that Sir R. Hoare should, if possible, let the whole matter drop out of the treaty negotiations, and that, if the Persians themselves raised the question, he was merely to remind them that the conditions already communicated to them for the transfer of the Residency represented the minima desiderata of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Annex. Sir R. Clive to M. Feroughi.Mon cher Ministre, Teheran, le 1&quot; octobre 1930.Ainsi que je vous ai promis, je vous transmets ci-joint [un aide-memoire sur le chemin de fer de Dozdab, une lettre par laquelle je vous fais part de la decision de mon Gouvernement relativement aux telegraphes et] un projet d&apos;echange de notes (avec traduction francaiseC) ) destine a regler la question de la Residence de Bouchir.En presence de ces trois documents, il me semble qu&apos;il sera dorenavant impossible de mettre en doute la volonte sincere du Gouvernement de Sa Majeste britannique de respecter les aspirations nationales de la Perse et d&apos;effacer tout soupcon d&apos;un manque d&apos;egards pour votre amour-propre.Veuillez, &amp;c.R. H. CLIVE.(6) Nut given here.Draft Exchange of Notes. (1).His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Minister to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. le Ministre,I have the honour, on behalf of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to request your Highness to be so good as to draw the attention of your Government to the following matter: Article 2 of the Treaty of Commerce between Great Britain and Persia, signed at Tehran on the 28th October, 1841, provided that &quot; as for a series of years
a Resident of the British Government has resided at Bushire, the Persian Govern-ment grants permission that the said Resident shall reside there as heretofore.&quot; Since that date, in virtue of the terms of that treaty, which has never been abrogated, the British Resident in the Persian Gulf has had his headquarters at Bushire. Since the year 1878 he has, in addition to these functions, held His Britannic Majesty&apos;s commission as consul-general, and has been recognised by the Imperial Persian Government as His Britannic Majesty&apos;s consul-general for the Provinces of Fars, Luristan and Khuzistan, for the district of Lingah and for the Persian coast and islands in the Persian Gulf.His Britannic -Majesty&apos;s Government have now decided to remove the head-quarters of this official to a site outside the dominions of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia, and effect will be given to this decision as soon as the incidental arrangements have been completed. Thereafter the Resident will cease to have a consular district in Persia, and will instead be described as inspecting consul-general. In that capacity it is contemplated that he shall inspect from time to time the British consular posts situated in the Persian ports of the Gulf.In view of the desirability of ensuring a close co-operation between the British and Persian authorities in the Persian Gulf, His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that the Imperial Government will be willing to accord the inspecting consul-general and his staff unrestricted access to British consular posts in Persian ports, and, in particular, will grant these persons a free visa, valid for at least a year. I should be glad to receive from your Highness an assurance that this request will be granted.It is understood that, as laid down in the notes which we have already exchanged in connexion with article III of the General Treaty, His Britannic Majesty&apos;s warships and the ships of the Royal Indian Marine stationed in the Persian Gulf together with the vessels of the auxiliary fleet, shall be able to put in at Bushire on a simple notification being given, as far as possible, in advance to the local authorities.(2) &apos;The Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Minister. M. le Ministre,I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency&apos;s note of to-day informing me of the decision taken by your Government to transfer the headquarters of the British Resident and consul-general at Bushire to a site outside the dominions of His Imperial Majesty the Shah. In that note you also inform me of the desire expressed by your Government, with a view to ensuring the close co-operation of the British and Persian authorities in the Persian Gulf, that this official should be accorded every facility for visiting British consular posts in the Persian ports of the Gulf.In reply, I have the honour to inform your Excellency that my Government will accord to the inspecting consul-general and to his staff the required facilities : they agree, in particular, that these persons shall enjoy on all occasions unrestricted access to British consular posts in the Persian ports of the Gulf, and they will make the necessary arrangements for the annual grant to them of a free visa valid for at least a year.With regard to the last paragraph of your note under reference, I am authorised to confirm that a simple notification, given as far as possible in advance to the local authorities, will suffice to enable His Britannic Majesty&apos;s warships -and the ships of the Royal Indian Marine stationed in the Persian Gulf, together with the vessels of the auxiliary fleet, to put in at Bushire.
ANNEX- III.Mr. Grieve (Treasury) to Mr. Rendel. (Received November 13.)Dear Rendel, Treasury Chambers, November 10, 1933.We have been considering the draft instructions to Sir R. Hoare on the subject of Persian Treaty negotiations, a copy of which, together with a copy of your letter of the 5th October to Laithwaite, was sent to us on the same date.2. We are, of course, aware of the difficulties which have recently arisen, and now stand in the way of an immediate resumption of Treaty negotiations. None the less, it may be convenient for you at this stage to have our views on the Instructions as drafted.3. We have nO comment to make apart from the debt question. As to this, while we have not formally given up all hope of recovering something, we are pretty well reconciled to the prospect of getting nothing. On that hypothesis the sole value of the debt is that it can be used as a weapon or a bribe in the negotiations, to secure some other object; and it is clearly desirable that it should be used as effectively as possible.4. Looking at the matter from this point of view, we should like you. to consider-whether we should start at the figure of  510,000. We, could argue thus : the offer to reduce the total debt to  1 million was made on condition that a general settlement was effected, but this general settlement was not effected, and therefore the offer lapses.. We accordingly return to the status quo, which is that the debt amounted to  2 million in April 1926. To this can be added seven years&apos; interest at 7 per cent. ( 980,000), less the interest regularly paid by Persia of  34,000 a year for seven years ( 240,000). We thus have a debt, as at the 1st April, 1933, of  2,740,000.. From this is to be deducted the debt of  490,000 repaid in June last, leaving  2,250,000.5. We don&apos;t want to press this at all, and are content to leave it to you to decide which will help our case most to pitch the initial claim high or low.6. On two points of detail the instructions regarding the debt require amendment: (1) The pre-war debt was repaid not in July 1933, but in June; (2) Half of the pre-war debt was in fact not ours, but the Government of India&apos;s.Yours sincerely,R. A. GRIEVE.oftWNEX II.Extract from the Conclusions of the Middle East Official Sub-C ommittee&apos;sMeeting of August 1, 1933.&quot; (3) (a). . That Sir Reginald Hoare should endeavour to obtain, as part of the general treaty settlement, a &apos; Gentlemen&apos;s Agreement,&apos; by which Hiis Majesty&apos;s Ships should continue to enjoy their present facilities at Henjam for as long a period as possible, in any case not less than twenty-five years.&quot;
