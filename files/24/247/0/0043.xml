IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC M/JESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.ICRET. ,43 ( 34)COPY NO, __C A B I N E To COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE NETHERLANDS,4 0Memo rand vim, by the Presidaa t of the Board of Trade.On Saturday, February 10th, I received Mr. Colijn, the. Prime Minister of Holland.    I attach as an appendix to this note a memorandum which I had previously sent as a matter of urgency to the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the subjects which I expected Mr. Colijn to raise.Mr. Colijn told me that he had, in fact, come to discuss with me the possible Dutch reply to our note aslcing for a statement as to their quota policy.   He wished to reply to the effect that Holland was prepared for three months to come to give the United Kingdom the same quotas which had been allotted to the United Kingdom up to the present.   During the three months Holland would wish to negotiate with us a commercial agreement to cover a longer period, say a year.    This was the policy which Holland had adopted with regard both to Germany and to Belgium.   With Germany she had completed negotiations.   Mr. Colijn could not charge his memory with the details, but his impression was that Germany had not, in fact, received any better treatment as a result of the negotiations than he was now offering us during the negotiations.   Belgium had accepted the offer to negotiate on the basis of the status quo.The object of the negotiations with us would be, if possible, to increase the trade between the two countries; and naturally Mr. Colijn stressed the importance of Holland&apos;s agricultural exports and the disastrous effect
which the change in our fiscal policy has had. on Holland. If, however, it proved impossible to increase the trade between the two countries, he thought it should be possible at any rate to secure it on its present basis for a time.   And if the negotiations failed, then, no doubt, both sides would be driven to retaliatory measures.    This last was what he wished to avoid, and that was why he had come to suggest those negotiations at once.I told Mr. Ciolijn that I was naturally sympathetically disposed towards such a proposalo   Neither he nor I wished to see our commercial relations reach the stage which Prance had now forced upon us.   However, I must consult my colleagues before undertaking to embark on negotiations0    I promised to let him know the result of that consultation at the earliest possible momentsMr0 Colijn told me that he would be grateful to know our attitude within the next few days.   All he asked for was a private intimation that, if the Dutch Government replied to our note suggesting negotiations on the basis that, for three months to come, we would receive the same quotas as in the past, that suggestion v/ould be received sympathetically by the British Government0I should point out that the proposal necessarily implies that, pending the negotiations, we should hold up the recommendation of I.DcA.0. that the duty on cut flowers should be raised from 9d. per lb. to l/3d0 per lb.My colleagues will remember that last July (Cab. 48 (33) Conclusion 9), they -^sked me to consider the possibility of embarking on commercial negotiations with Holland.WoR.Board of Trade,12th February, 1934.
DUTCH QUOTA RESTRICTIONS,1. Quota restrictions have been imposed for some tine past on imports into Holland of a number of goods, notably ootton and woollen textiles.     Hitherto,  quotas have been allocated equitably as betwcn the various supplying countries, being based on the average imports from each country during two preceding years.     Moreover in most cases the quotas have been 90 to 100 per cent,  of imports in the basic period, although in some instances they have been less (e.g. woollens 65 per cent.)2.  The Dutch recently passed a new law giving them power to allot special quotas over and above the basic quotas to countries giving favourable treatment to Dutch imports.      It appeared that they proposed to make use af these new powers to reduce the basic quotas for each class of goods and to use the balance for bargaining purposes.     Accordingly a note -was submitted to the Netherlands Government towards the end of January seeking a definite statement from the Netherlands Government as to their policy.      In this note it was pointed out that the balance of trade still remains in favour of the Netherlands and that if quotas were allocated to United Kingdom goods on a less favourable basis than to other foreign countries, His Majesty&apos;s Government could hardly be expected to continue to allocate their own quotas (bacon, etc.)  to the Netherlands on a like basis.3. No reply has been received to this note, but it is now known that substantial reductions have been made in the quotas (including woollens and pottery) due for renewal on the 1st February.   Quotas on other goods,  including cotton textiles, are due for revision on the 1st March.      It is also reported that the new quotas are the minimum quantities vhich may be imported from each country and that they may be increased considerably for certain countries; and it is understood that, in view of a Treaty which has recently been concluded with Germany, imports from that country are likely not to be seriously affected.      In other words, it seems clear
that the Netherlands Government have adopted the same policy as France of using quotas as a bargaining weapon and may shortly be discriminating against us. even if they are not already doing so.4. Dutch trade to the United Kingdom has been severely hit in the last two years, the imports in the first nine months of 1933 being little more than half those in the corresponding period of 1931.      On the other hand thoy have continued so far to treat our exports remarkably favourably.      Our trade with Holland in the first nine months of 1931 and of 1933 was as follows:-The Dutch, like the French, are anxious to enter into general commercial negotiations with us and it seems not improbable that, if we were to agree to enter into such negotiations as soen as practicable, they, for their part, might be ready to agree meanwhile to accord to us most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of their quotas pending such negotiations.      It should be mentioned in this connection that the Import DutieB Advisory Committee recently recommended a large increase in the already heavy duty on cut flowers and flowers attached to bulbs, which are a hutch speciality.      Action on this reoommendation has been temporarily suspended because it would obviously Inflame still further the growing hostility In Holland to the effects of our economic policy and prejudice the prospects of coming to terms on their quotas.5. In all the circumstances, It saems that there are only two courses of action open to us.      The first is to threaten the Dutch that unless they immediately withdraw their discriminatory quotas we shall cut down their bacon quota and impose the increased duty, on cut flowers.      The second course is to agree to enter into commercial negotiations with them on the understanding that1931 (9 months;  000&apos;1935 (9 months)  000&apos;Total Imports.. British Exports26,234 9,92414,040 8,957
meanwhile they v*ill restore to us the full quotas on the most-favoured-nation basis, while we will continue to accord them most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of our own quotas and would not meanwhile increase the duty on flowers,There can be little doubt that if the first alternative is followed,  the position will rapidly deteriorate and we shall very shortly be in the same position as we now are with the French.    This is very undesirable on general grounds and particularly because the Dutch have hitherto treated our trade so well, while we have very seriously interfered with their exports to us.    It is strongly felt that we should be placing ourselves in a false position by following this course, and it is accordingly suggested that the matter be discussed with M. Colijn on the lines of the cecond alternative.Board of Trade,6th February, 1934.
