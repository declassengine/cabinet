(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MJSSTf lS GOVERMMTl-SECRET.. CP. 16 (34).Copy No..CAB IN E TIndian Affairs:    Question of the future of the pay cut on the salaries of the Indian Services.Memorandum by the,,,,Secretary of State for India.My colleagues will recollect that in connection with the Indian emergency budget of September 1931 a cut of 10% was imposed on the pay of members of the Indian Services and that with effect from 1st April, 1933? this emergency cut was reduced toThe authority of Parliament for the application of thescut to officers whose pay is protected by Statute   was given in the first instance for a period of lb months ending 31st March, 1933j and was subsequently renewed (in respect of the reduced cut) for one year which will expire on 31st March next.. The Government of India&apos;s General Budget estimates for 1934--35 indicate that on the basis of existing, taxation and of the present position generally there will be a deficit of Rs.677 lakhs, if the emergency 5% P&amp;y cut is not continued. But, in view of the very serious financial difficulties of Bengal and Assam, it is thought necessary to provide help for those Provinces from the Central Exchequer to the amount of approximately Rs.215 lakhs in 1934-35-   On this basis the total estimated budget deficit is approximately Rs.892 lakhs.The/These officers are those who were appointed by the Secretary of State in Council before&apos;the commencement of the Government of India Act 1919-   It is generally agreed that it is impossible to cut the pay of ail ttie rest of the Services in India and exemot these officers,
j. ^ 0the government of india propose to meet this deficit as follows1. by adjustment of, and ab-ditions to, taxation.2. by reduction of the provisions for the reduction and avoidance of debt.3. by continuance of the emergency 5% pay cut.the government of india have urged that their budgetary position and that of the majority of the provinces, does not warrant the remission of any part of the existing % pay cut;     that any such remission when clearly unjustified financially and accompanied with fresh taxation (in addition to the drastic increases of taxation which have already been imposed during the last three years) would arouse intense resentment in india including that of the european business community;   and that from the point of view of india&apos;s credit a most unfortunate effect would be created, if a substantial reduction in sinking fund provisions took place simultaneously with a remission of the cut in pay.in the circumstances i have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the 5% pay cut now in force must be continued for another year until 31st march, 1935-subject to the approval of my colleagues, i therefore propose to introduce at an early date a short bill taking power to continue for one more year the application of the existing cut to officers of the indian services whose pay is protected by statute.in/rs. lakhs. 4,10 3,94-9o&quot;  7 co
In announcing the decision to continue the cut, I shall repeat the promise that Government is determined that the cut shall be wholly remitted immediately the financial position permits.S.H.India Office 20th January 1934.
