. &apos;v r*HIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO.        esX-C P B I TT E T PETROLEUM (PRODUCTION)  BILL COMMITTEE, Report,At their Meeting on the 31st January, 1934,  (Cabinet 3 (34) Conclusion 9) the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade covering the draft Petroleum (Production) Bill (CP. 23 (34)), and agreed inter alia;    that the question of compensation for the compulsory acquisition of surface rights should be referred to a Cabinet Committee composed as follows:--The President of the Board of Trade (In the Chair), The Secretary of State for War, The Minister of Health, The Postmaster General. We have had before us the Memorandum (CP. 23 (34))  referred to above, together with a Memorandum (P.P.  (34) 2) furnished by the Mines Department of the Board of Trade on the question of compensation for the compulsory acquisition of surface rights. We have also discussed the objections which might be raised in Parliament in the absence of a more definite assurance in the Bill on the point of compensation.      It was emphasised during the discussion that the Bill contained features which justified special consideration being given to the terms on which owners of surface rights might obtain compensation in the event of interference under the compulsory powers proposed to be granted. It was generally felt that in order to insure the passage ofEGRET. 41  (34).-1-
the Bill through Parliament it would he necessary to insert some special previsions regarding compensation in such cases, though it was made clear that this must he done without creating an embarrassing precedent.We accordingly agreed to recommend the addition to the Bill of a clause containing the following provisions(a) A provision on the lines of proviso (a) to section 3 (3) of the draft Petroleum (Production) Bill of 1920 requiring the Railway and Canal Commission to have regard to the effect, on the amenities of the locality of the use of the land as proposed;(b) A provision permitting the Commission, when determining the amount and nature of compen-sat ion in cases of acquisition of surface, etc., rights under the Bill, to make an addition of net less than ten per cent, to the compensation,  such addition to be payable in respect of the compulsory powers under the Bill;    the benefit of the provision to be limited to owners and. not to extend to third parties;(c) A provision to the effect that the licensee should pay the landowner&apos;s costs unless the Commission was satisfied that an unconditional offer had been made by the licensee of a sum as compensation equal to or greater than the amount of the compensation awarded by the Commission, and a further provision to the effect that a landowner who was awarded by the Commission compensation smaller than he had been offered by the licensee in previous negotiations would not have to pay the licensee&apos;s costs.A draft claxise giving effect to the above proposals has been prepared and is circulated herewith.We recommend to the Cabinet that this draft clause should be incorporated in the petroleum (Production) Bill.Signed,  on behalf of the Committee, WALTER RUNCIMAN.
