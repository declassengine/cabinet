THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 12 (34).CABINET.HOUSING POLICY.Memorandum by Minister of Health.I HAVE to bring to the attention of my colleagues the matter of the housing of the working classes, and to propose certain measures for which the time, in my opinion, is now ripe.The housing evils with which we have to deal present themselves under two chief aspects. One is overcrowding : we have not got enough dwellings for the working classes. The other is slums : of the houses which we have, some are not fit for human habitation. An active housing policy should, therefore, have two objects to rehouse the dwellers in slums, and to reduce overcrowding by increasing the number of dwellings. The two aspects are closely connected. Slums are commonly overcrowded, and overcrowding leads to the making of slums. But they are not coterminous. Not all slums are overcrowded, and not all overcrowded areas are slums.It will be remembered that we decided in the autumn of 1932 that the subsidy in aid of housing generally should cease, and that the activities of local authorities should be directed to slum clearance, the subsidy in aid of the housing of persons displaced from slum houses being retained.The reasons for this decision were briefly as follows : :(1) The reduction in the cost of building and the lowering of rates of interest enabled local authorities to build without subsidy small houses which could be let at rents within a few pence of 7s. 9d. weekly (exclusive of rates), that being the figure contemplated when the 1924 Act subsidy was instituted.(2) All the subsidised building of the previous thirteen years had done little to reduce overcrowding, and practically nothing towards the abolition of slums.(3) Very little progress in dealing directly with slums had been made under the Act of 1930, and it seemed unlikely that progress could be hastened so long as local authorities were engaged in the construction of housing estates not directly related to slum clearance.(4) With the disappearance of the competition of subsidised housing, private enterprise should be capable of providing the new houses required by the population at large.Closely connected with and supplementary to the new housing policy were the decisions to preserve until 1938 the pool of small houses controlled under the Rent Restrictions Act and to set up the Departmental Committee on Housing presided over by Lord Moyne, whose reference included the consideration of the further steps &apos;&apos; necessary or desirable to secure the maintenance of a proper standard of fitness for human habitation in working-class houses which are neither situate in an area suitable for clearance under Part I of the Housing Act, 1930, nor suitable for demolition under Section 19 of that Act.&quot;[9612] b
The essence of the policy thus adopted in 1932, and now being applied, was to restore freedom to normal sources of supply, but to take vigorous direct action against those housing evils which need it, because unassisted private enterprise is incapable of curing them. For the cure of those evils in the past much reliance was placed on indirect action. It was hoped that the provision at large of houses for the working classes would indirectly remedy the evils of slums.and over-crowding by &quot; filtering up.&quot; Experience falsified those hopes. Its lesson in the matter of slums, for instance, was that the building of new housing &quot;estates left slums unaffected. The deduction was clear that to get rid of slums one must require their abolition directly, using subsidy as an inducement to support the requirement.Slum Clearance.It was in the matter of slum clearance that the need for direct action was most obvious and urgent. We had, in the first place, to get the local authorities to establish their programmes for the purpose under the Act of 1930, and to make a beginning with them.That has now been done. Action for the clearance of slums is in progress. We have called upon the housing authorities to ascertain the slums which should be cleared, and to frame programmes for clearing them in five years; 1,604 out of 1,716 have replied, and the programmes of clearance will amount to between 230,000 and 240,000 houses. A great majority of these programmes I have been able to accept. There were some 250 authorities whose programmes were prima facie inadequate: I am negotiating with them, and with the 112 authorities who have not yet submitted programmes, for an adequate programme, and they are aware that, unless it is forthcoming, I. shall exercise my default powers. In eleven cases enquiries have already been ordered into local conditions, and are now proceeeding.Progress with Schemes.My colleagues will be interested to know that during the nine months ended the 31st December, 1933, over 12,000 houses for rehousing slum dwellers were approved, this figure comparing with the previous maximum of just under 4,900 during the twelve months ended the 31st March, 1933. Moreover, enquiries which have been made as to the anticipated action of the local authorities during the present year show that in 310 areas Orders covering 33,224 houses will be made, and will involve the holding of practically 600 local enquiries.There is good reason for satisfaction with the response made by the local authorities to the Governments appeal. Their programmes involve the building of an average of something over 50,000 houses a year for the next five years, a figure which compares favourably with the total output of houses by local, authorities for all purposes of 49,213 in the twelve months ended the 30th September, 1933.What is now needed in this matter is to keep up steam. The programmes have got to be translated into schemes, and each scheme has got to be adopted by the local authority and passed by me after local inquiry. We must expect some relaxation of effort on the part of local authorities as the initial impetus wears itself out. We must expect, too, growing opposition from slum-owners as threats to their interests become deeds. Steady administrative pressure will be needed; but the line of policy is straightforward.Reconditioning.Now that the campaign against slums is under way the time is ripe for providing a legislative basis for the stimulation of direct action as to further and other aspects of housing evils. The slum campaign deals with existing slums. The next aspect to be dealt with is the prevention of the decay of existing accommodation by reconditioning.A stimulus for this work has been postponed, until the slum campaign has advanced so far in order that it might as little as possible confuse or delay the start with the more vital work of clearance. An occasion for legislation is provided by the report of Lord Moyne&apos;s Committee, which was appointed to make recommendations on this subject and reported last July.** A copy of this report is attached.
The objects of policy in the matter of reconditioning should, in my opinion, be as follows : &apos; . (i) To strengthen the hands of housing authorities to prepare and carry out, in connection with planning schemes where desirable, programmes for the reconditioning of working-class housing properties unfit for habitation, but which can be made fit to last for a reasonable time and at reasonable cost.(ii) To extend for the purpose the powers of housing authorities to acquireand recondition such properties. .(iii) To extend the powers Of public utility societies for these purposes.The following is the substance of the legislation required for these purposes : Local Housing Authorities.&apos;-: Power should be given to housing authorities to acquire compulsorily properties suitable for reconditioning. *The compensation should be market value, with allowance for cost of restoring to a sanitary condition, and for illegal use or overcrowding (as provided by the Acquisition of Land Act, 1919, amended by Third Schedule to the Housing Act, 1930).It may be necessary to consider the provision of subsidy in an appropriate form to assist local authorities with the work of reconditioning, but I suggest that this&apos;may be reserved for subsequent consideration with the Treasury and the local authorities in the first place.Public Utility Societies.Power should be given to a Public Utility Society, with the approval of a Central Committee, referred to hereafter, to submit to housing authorities proposals for the compulsory acquisition by the local authority of properties for reconditioning by the Public Utility Society as agent of the housing authority.,When a proposal of the sort by a public utility society has been accepted by a housing authority, a central financing authority (possibly the Public Works Loan Commissioners) should be empowered to advance to the housing authority, on the security of the local rates and revenues, 90 per cent, of the amount required for the acquisition of the property, and for the work of reconditioning. The amount advanced for reconditioning would be passed on by the housing authority to the public utility society as its agents for the work. Normally, the scheme would provide for the leasing of the reconditioned property by the housing authority to the public utility society for management.These proposals are in accordance in many particulars with the recommenda-tions of the Moyne Report. There is one fundamental difference. The policy of the Moyne Report is to bring public utility societies on to the scene as housing authorities for reconditioning alternative to and capable of replacing the present housing authorities. This policy is expressed in the recommendation of the Report (recommendation 16, page 58) that the Ministry of Health should have power to invest a Society with the reconditioning powers of a local housing authority, if the housing authority declines, or delays, to act on the representa-tions of the Society.It would, in my view, be a mistake to adopt this recommendation. To do so would inevitably be to fall between two stools. We should anger and discourage the local housing authorities; and Public Utility Societies provide a totally inadequate organisation with which to replace them. Neither those Societies, nor any other form of voluntary effort, provide a possible alternative to the powerful organisation of the local housing authorities for this or any other general housing purpose.On the other hand, Public Utility Societies have done good work, especially in London, and, with encouragement, can do more. They provide a convenient means of enlisting for housing purposes forces of knowledge and goodwill that should not be wasted.   The help proposed in the matter of finance is, in my* They have the power to do so now, but on a voluntary basis only. [9612] &quot; B 2
opinion, the most practical help that can be given to them, and the least that will serve to enable them to do their best.Their activities, however, must be brought into proper relation with those of the local authorities. For this purpose, it must be made clear that the duty of the local authority in housing matters is primary. Proposals of Public Utility Societies must be related to the general housing programme of the local authority. The relation between the two will then be that the local authority may accept the proposal of a Public Utility Society to carry out some specified part of its programme.A novel recommendation of the Moyne Report that it is not proposed to adopt is that of the &quot;refund&quot; basis of compensation for houses compulsorily purchased for reconditioning (paragraphs 25-31 of Report). Its simplicity makes it very attractive at first sight; but, on closer examination, it has defects that could not be defended. It may be, as said in the Report, that, on the &quot;refund&quot; basis, the whole class of owners concerned would get, by a simple process, about what their properties are worth. But there is nothing in the method to secure that in each particular case the owner will get neither more nor less than it is worth. A method by which it is quite possible that there will be positive injustice either to the owners or to the taxpayer and ratepayer in every case of its application is one that can hardly stand the strain of practice.Overcrowding and redevelopment in relation thereto.So far I have dealt with dwellings that are in themselves either remediably or irremediably unfit for habitation. But, if we stop there, we do not deal with all the aspects of housing evils that need direct action for their remedy. There remains the specific evil of overcrowding, not necessarily in dwellings appropriate for clearance as slums under the Act of 1930, or for reconditioning.There is not and cannot be any clear-cut definition of overcrowding. Houses vary in size, and men, women and children cannot be regarded merely as arithmetical units. The problem is well illustrated by the following figures, in which an arbitrary standard* of overcrowding is taken :-Treated arithmetically the overcrowded families of 1921 could have been satisfactorily housed by the provision of 614,352 new houses and the increase of population would have required 460,000 more. 1,074,352 new houses therefore should theoretically have cured the overcrowding of 1921 and met the needs of the increased population. In fact, there was a margin of some 500,000 new houses over and above that number and yet the decrease in overcrowded families between 1921 and 1931 was only 173,300 or 11-4 per cent.It is evident that something more is needed than a system under which, notwithstanding an unexampled provision of new houses in a decennium, over-crowding is only reduced by 11-4 per cent. It is true that 1941 will probably show greater progress, since slum clearance, and its attendant rehousing should get rid of an appreciable amount of overcrowding. The suspension of decontrol until 1938 will also help, for as decontrolled small houses become vacant new occupants can transfer to them without having to pay increased rent. But, as said, experience has shown that reliance must not be placed on the process of &quot; filtering up.&quot; So far as the smaller towns are concerned it may be effective, for the new houses are not too far from the old. In the large towns the case is different, and the fact has to be faced that the attractions, industrial and other-wise, of their central parts are bound to result in overcrowding in the absence of direct counter-measures. Failing such measures, bye-laws to deal with over-crowding,&apos; such as local authorities are empoAvered to make under the Housing Act, 1925, cannot be effectively enforced.It is pertinent to mention here that the Association of.Municipal Corpora-tions has recently passed resolutions advocating a direct subsidy to deal with overcrowding.* Namely, that a family is overcrowded unless it has a sitting-room not used for sleeping purposes and enough bedrooms to accommodate not more than two sleepers in each.&quot; Overcrowded &quot; families 1921 New houses 1921-311,526,907 1,600,000 2,060,000 1,353,568Increase of population 1921-31 &quot;Overcrowded &quot; families 1931
Overcrowding is in the main a problem. of the large towns, London, in, &apos; particular.    London and other towns with a population exceeding 100,000 accounted for more than half &apos; of the overcrowding according to the Census criterion in 1931.   It must be recognised that there is no short cut to the solution ; of the problem.  The necessary processes must be spread over many years, though : nothing like so long as the &quot; filtration &quot; process; and the cost will be heavy, for these processes must.almost of necessity involve in many cases the reconstruction of large areas, and schemes comparable in size to those which have given us Kingsway and Aldwych in London and Corporation Street in Birmingham., ,The central recommendations of the Moyne Committee were that subsidy should be made available for rehousing the excess of population in working-class houses which are not in all respects fit for human habitation, but can be made fit, and to which a probable life of at least twenty years can be given; and that local authorities should be given compulsory powers and encouraged to acquire such properties for reconditioning.I would extend these recommendations in the matters of subsidy and ; compulsory powers in order to assist local authorities in dealing directly with the specific evil of overcrowding. Overcrowding is a more serious menace to health than deficiencies which can be met by reconditioning, and I think it is essential that compulsory power to acquire property should be available as a means of curing it in areas where the residential circumstances are such that the remedy lies in demolition, replanning and reconstruction rather than in reconditioning.The objects of policy in this matter should then, in my opinion, be as follows : To strengthen the hands of housing authorities to prepare and carry out in connection with planning schemes where desirable programmes for dealing with overcrowded areas, adequate provision in appropriate cases being made for reconstruction and rehousing on the site.The following is the substance of the legislation required for the purpose :  Exchequer grant should be available in aid of the cost of schemes for dealing with overcrowded areas. The amount and basis of the grant would remain to be discussed with the Treasury and the local authorities in the first place.The grant would be available for public utility societies, for rehousing in respect of overcrowding in reconditioned houses, under the conditions already referred to.The test of an overcrowded area would be a public health test that the overcrowding was such as to cause injury, or danger of injury, to health.There should be power to housing authorities compulsorily to acquire overcrowded areas.The compensation to be market value, with allowance for illegal use or overcrowding (as provided by the Acquisition of Land Act, 1919) amended by the Third Schedule to the Housing Act of 1930). In the case of a house requiring to be cleared as unfit for habitation, the compensation would be site value as provided by the Act of 1930.It is proposed to requh*e that programmes for the exercise of these powers shall be prepared in relation to the existing slum clearance programmes and future programmes of reconditioning, and that they should be related also to town planning schemes where desirable. Local authorities will thus be charged with the duty of making proposals for dealing as a whole with all the aspects of the housing problem in their locality that are appropriate for direct action, and with putting those programmes into effect in due course, as time and means permit.It is proposed to reserve very wide discretion to the Minister of Health as to the approval of schemes for the exercise of these powers. This is necessary in order to secure that the bad conditions to be dealt with shall be thoroughly remedied from the root, and that grants shall not be frittered away, leaving those conditions unremedied or remedied for a time only. It would be a condition of -schemes that bye-laws against overcrowding should be brought into, and kept in,
full effect.  Power must be taken to. secure that bye-laws adequate for the purpose are made where they do not exist.Normally, in the case at any rate of all but the smaller cities, it will not be possible to deal effectively with overcrowded areas without largely rehousing on the site of the area formerly overcrowded. Normally, also rehousing on the site cannot be done as efficiently and economically as possible without redeveloping the area in a greater or less degree in order to make the best of it for housing, under proper conditions, as big a population as possible. Further, such redevelopment cannot in general be efficiently carried out with divided ownership. It is, therefore, contemplated that normally it should be a condition of the approval of schemes for dealing with overcrowding that they should provide for the acquisition by the local authority under the new powers of the area concerned, or, at any rate, those parts of it that are essential for proper planning and redevelopment.With redevelopment, involving in some cases the creation of new frontages and improved sites, there should not infrequently be some resultant profit to set against the cost of the scheme.In order to make sure that the planning and redevelopment are properly carried out, it will be necessary to make provision (usual in. such a connection) to enable the local authority to acquire for the purpose areas of reasonable size which may not be the subject of overcrowding, but which are essential for the carrying out of a properly co-ordinated scheme.There will no doubt be cases in which redevelopment of the whole or part Of the overcrowded area will not be necessary, either because its development cannot be substantially improved upon, or because the population displaced through overcrowding can be effectively housed in the neighbourhood without redevelopment. Such cases may be expected to occur in smaller towns where vacant sites for rehousing may be found not too far away from the original sites. In such cases, acquisition by the local authority of the whole or part of the over-crowded area would not be an essential condition of the approval of the scheme.One of the disadvantages of any such developments in the near future is that they may tend to slow down slum clearance. The danger must be carefully guarded against; but this can, in my opinion, be done both in the presentation of the new proposals, and in the administrative action taken to bring them into effect.This would not be a short-term policy. It is one which would have to be fully discussed with the representatives of the local authorities, and the question of the basis and amount of the necessary subsidies will require careful examination..Management.An aspect of housing conditions which needs attention is that of the manage-ment of publicly owned housing estates for the working classes. Management by the housing committee of a local authority is by no means an ideal system. Such a committee, consisting principally of elected members, is inevitably open to political and other indirect influences, and does not provide the necessary continuity of practice. The object of policy, I suggest, should be to provide for the purpose some body more permanent in its character, and more independent of the influences referred to.For this purpose, I make the following proposals :-Power should be given to housing authorities to establish local manage-ment commissioners, responsible to the appointing authority, to whom such properties might, and should normally, be transferred on lease for manage-ment after reconditioning or reconstruction.Power should be given to housing authorities to transfer any other publicly owned housing properties to the management commissioners on lease. Power should be given to housing authorities to transfer such properties to public utility societies, alternative to the power to transfer them to local management commissioners.Central Committee.In view of the proposals for the establishment of local management com-missioners, and in view also of the encouragement which it is proposed to give to
public utility societies, I think it would be desirable that a central committee should be established by statute for the following purposes has to Management Commissioners.To consider the terms and conditions under which local management commissioners should be established, and to advise the Minister of Health thereon.To survey the reports of the local management commissioners to the local authorities, and to bring to the notice of the Minister of Health any matters arising thereon.To prepare model regulations for the management of properties administered by local management commissioners, subject to the approval of the Minister of Health.To advise as to the supply and training of property managers.As to Public Utility Societies.To assist the formation of societies in suitable areas, and to advise them in their operations.      NTo consider and report to the Minister of Health as to the approval of societies, and to consider and report to him upon their reports and accounts.To consider the proposals of societies, and to advise the Minister of Health thereon, and as to the amount of advances.The Supply of Small Houses in General.&quot;Legislation on the lines suggested would arm the local authorities and the Government with the powers, financial and otherwise, necessary for the direct attack on those housing evils which need for their remedy direct action and the help of subsidies, that is, slums, dwellings needing reconditioning; and over-crowded areas. It remains to &quot;consider the position as to the supply of houses in general for the working classes, other than houses built with the help of subsidy under the powers referred to.For the building of such houses we are relying, in the first place, on private enterprise. To help during the period of transition away from general subsidy there are some 31,500 houses still to be built by local authorities under the Wheatley Act and the Proviso to Section 1 of the Act of 1933, which in so far as they are completed before the 30th June (and the bulk will be so completed*) will earn subsidy.As an insurance against any failure thereafter in the general supply, there is the duty of the local authorities to meet, if necessary, the housing needs of the working classes of their localities by building without subsidy. They can do so now on an economic basis. That is, they can build 3 bedroom non-parlour houses of about 760 square feet area to let at about 7s. 9d., excluding rates.Lastly, there is the scheme for financing such building proposed to me by the building societies and embodied in the Act of 1933. It is too soon yet to tell how much practical use will be made of this scheme. It has, however, made a very slow beginning, and although there are now signs that better use will be made of it in the future, it will be best not to expect it to be more than it was intended to be, a minor help towards providing finance for building.As regards the provision of houses by private enterprise, the general course of events since the passage of the Act has been as follows : In two important respects expectations as to the consequences of the Act have been fulfilled. The cost of building has had a further fall. The average cost of building non-parlour houses, which was  371 at the introduction of the Act, has now fallen to  354. Coupled with a further fall in interest rates, this enables the type of house in question now to be let at a rent of 10s. 6d. a week (including rates), in comparison with 11s. 2d. a week (including rates), at the time when the Act was introduced (rates being estimated at 2s. Qd. a week).The passing of the Act has also been followed by a very substantial increase in the activity of the private builder. The total number of houses built in the twelve months to the end of September last was 218,313, in comparison with 201,976 in the preceding twelve months. Of the former figure, 166,644 were built* The balance, completed after the 30th June, will form an early instalment of unsubsidised building by local authorities such as is referred to in other paragraphs of this memorandum.
by private enterprise without subsidy, an increase of 35,814 in comparison with the number built by private enterprise without subsidy in the preceding twelve months. This activity is maintained at the present time.* Indeed, the characteristic feature of housing events since the introduction of the Act has been the fresh impetus given to the boom in the building by private enterprise of small houses to sell. Incidentally, unemployment in the building industry at the end of November last had decreased by 75,718 in England and Wales, in comparison with the corresponding month of the previous year.Our supply of houses for the past year has thus been as follows : Built by Private enterprise without subsidy ... 166,644Private enterprise with subsidy ... 2,456Local authorities with subsidy ... 47,977Local authorities without subsidy ... 1,236Total ... ... ...      218,313How has this met our need for the small houses to let of the type we need V Subsidised houses provided by the housing authorities are, of course, small houses to let. A full answer to that question requires in addition an analysis of the houses built by private enterprise. The statistics available help us only to the extent of telling us that 86 per cent, of the 166,644 houses built by private enterprise in the year ended September 1933 are less than  26 rateable value ( 35 in London). To get what further light can be got on a vital matter, I have made a sample inquiry relating to houses with a rateable value below  26 ( 35 in London). During the half-year ended September 1933, 75,692 such houses were built by private enterprise. The inquiry covered over 13,000 of these houses, that is, over 17 per cent, of the total. The information obtained so far suggests that as many as 38 per cent, of the 75,692 houses (that is, 29,000 in number) are probably under  13 rateable value in the provinces and  20 in London. That means that they are what, as regards rent restriction, are called &quot; C &quot; class houses, commonly considered as houses of a class suitable for manual workers. It also suggests that as many as 19 per cent, of the 75,692 houses (14,500 in number) are houses to let. The classes are not co-extensive, i.e., the houses to let are not all &quot; C &quot; class houses.A further sample is being obtained in respect of houses built by private enterprise since the 30th September, 1933. The returns are not complete, but in 50 areas outside Greater London and 15 areas in Greater London, 19,176 houses had been provided by private enterprise, of which 7,210 (or 38 per cent.) were &quot; C &quot; class nouses. Of the 19,176 houses, 2,961 were let (or 16 per cent.) Of the 7,210 &quot; C &quot; class houses, 1,400 (or 19 per cent.) were let. Of the 3,721 &quot; C &quot; class houses outside Greater London, 1,285 (or 35 per cent.) were let.My inquiries suggest, therefore, that on the whole a surprisingly large percentage of houses built by private enterprise in the last 12 months arc small houses and houses to let.  There is here evidence of a move in the right direction.Further, although houses of the type which private enterprise prefers to build at present, the small house to sell at about  400, are too dear for the lower-paid manual worker, the increase in their supply tends to set free accommodation to let, and to reduce rents. I have had special inquiries made in order to get evidence as to the practical value of this tendency. A sample test, made in six towns, in each of which at least 100 new houses erected in 1933 were selected at random, shows rather strikingly how the increase in the number of these houses to sell releases accommodation for the lower-paid wage-earners (see Appendix).On the whole there is no reason to suppose that private enterprise cannot now be relied upon to provide in due course all that is necessary in the way of ordinary housing for persons in receipt of normal wages, given that local authorities provide the rehousing necessary in connection with slum clearance, and with schemes to be undertaken under the proposals I have outlined to deal with overcrowding.   Some of the specially low-rented houses so provided will be* The value of dwelling- houses for which plans were passed by local authorities in England aud Wales in the list quarter of 1933 was  14,448,900 in comparison with  10,511,800 in the corresponding-quarter of 1932.
available for families who do not come from the old slum houses or from the decrowded houses.I have no doubt therefore that the best course to pursue in order to secure, in the long run, a supply as free as possible of small houses to let in general, apart from the provision of subsidised houses as proposed, will be to continue to give private enterprise the first chance of building the houses and to encourage unsubsidised building by local authorities only in cases where it is proved that private enterprise cannot or will not meet the ascertained demand. Nor do I think that this course will be politically difficult if a definite statement is made of measures designed to deal directly with overcrowding. ; :It will, of course, be necessary for me to be on my guard against any marked decrease in the total supply of small houses to let. Of that there should be no immediate danger. The supply of subsidised houses will not cease for some months yet, and thereafter local authorities, as stated, have both the duty and the power to meet the housing needs of the working classes by unsubsidised building. Should occasion anywhere require I should secure the performance of this duty. In case of need I should withdraw the present administrative condition which requires local authorities that propose unsubsidised building to produce some evidence that their housing needs cannot and will not be met by private enterprise and if necessary take the further step of actively encouraging local authorities to submit programmes of unsubsidised building.Conclusion.The proposals which I have made above as to reconditioning and over-crowding, and particularly the latter, will need much labour to fix the financial conditions. All the proposals will need full discussion with the London County Council and the representative associations of local authorities. In putting them before my colleagues, therefore, I do so as a preliminary to final proposals, and ask for such general approval as will enable me usefully to undertake the work and the negotiations referred to.(Initialled) E.

APPENDIX.AT least 100 houses erected in 1933 were selected at random in each of six towns. Calls were made at each house and particulars of occupancy were obtained, including the previous address of the occupant. Then a call was made at the previous address given, and the procedure was repeated up to the third removal, or until the chain ended, e.g., because the occupants were newly-married people leaving their parents&apos; homes, or until it was impracticable to follow it up because the occupants were persons who had come from some other town. In all, some 709 new houses were examined, and in 249 cases the complete chain of removals caused by the occupancy of the new house was followed up. Apart from eleven cases in which the chains ended in condemned or demolished houses, these completed chains ended either in rooms or houses still empty at the time of the inquiry, or in rooms vacated and no longer being sub-let, or in newly-married people leaving their parents&apos; homes. The inquiry showed that, notwithstanding that only about one-third of the chains were complete, the provision of the 709 new houses enabled 694 working-class families (not including the occupants of the new houses) to move their quarters, and examination of the details of these removals enables it to be said that 364 of these families definitely improved their position in that they either obtained more convenient or up-to-date accommoda-tion, or were able to secure better accommodation at a reduced rent.This inquiry also brought out the fact that the new houses are being largely taken by the artisan or skilled worker type. Eighty per cent, of the houses under a rateable value of  13 were so occupied. This may be explained to some extent by the fact that in about 20 per cent, of the new houses examined, the occupants had more than one income in the family.o

This Committee was appointed by you on the 6th March, 1933, &quot; to consider and report (a) what, if any, further steps are necessary or desirable to secure the maintenance of a proper standard of fitness for human habitation in working-class houses which are neither situate in an area suitable for clearance under Part I of the Housing Act, 1930, nor suitable for demolition under Section 19 of that Act; and (b) what, if any, further steps are necessary or desirable to promote the supply of houses for the working-classes, without public charge, through the agency of public utility societies or other bodies subject to similar limitations operating in particular areas or otherwise : We now have the honour to submit our Report.PART I.-INTRODUCTION.2.

It should be observed that our terms of reference exclude consideration of (a) any houses which are suitable for clearance or demolition under the Housing Act, 1930, and (b) any proposals for general new building which would involve a public charge.We think it desirable to draw attention to these limitations at the outset of our Report, in order that there may be no mis-understanding as to the scope of the Committee&quot;s inquiry. We were not charged with the duty of rewriting the Housing Acts or of making proposals for a new general housing policy. The GovernmemVs housing policy, stated shortly, is to concentrate public effort and money on the clearance and improvement of slum con-ditions, and to rely in the main on competitive private enterprise to provide a new supply of accommodation for the working classes  the provision by private enterprise to be supplemented, where necessary, by means of unsubsidised building by the Local Autho-rities. This policy is fully explained in three circulars which have been issued by the Minister since our inquiry started. We have sought to accommodate our recommendations to that general posi-tion and to avoid making any proposals which would either impede the five years slum clearance programmes of Local Authorities or deter private enterprise from the provision of new houses.6. Although our terms of reference limit us to consideration of part only of the general housing question we, realise that that question is one which must be looked at and dealt with as a whole on a co-ordinated plan. For example, in the ordinary slum or semi-slum district houses of varying degrees of unfitness are com-monly found and resort must be had to a variety of remedies; some houses may require to be demolished as being completely unfit and some to be repaired or reconditioned. The houses which are entirely unfit are excluded from our terms of reference, but can and should be demolished under the Act of 1930; and we explain
later in our report that we are opposed to the policy of reconditioning as an alternative to the demolition of such houses. . It. would be the very opposite of our intention if the impression were to be formed that our proposals afford any excuse to any Local Authority&quot; to limit or slacken their energies in the clearance of slums and the demolition of unfit houses. Our proposals are intended to fill what&apos; we think is a gap in the existing housing policy for the improvement of what we regard as slum conditions existing outside the technical slum. Clearly, however, proposals for repair or reconditioning must be related to and co-ordinated with proposals for clearance; otherwise reconditioning schemes would be mere unsatisfactory patchwork. We have, therefore, recommended that such new machinery as may be necessary for the operation of our proposals shall be closely linked to and co-ordinated with the existing machinery of the Local Authorities and the Ministry of Health. In dealing with that part of the problem with which we are concerned we have tried not to lose sight of the whole, but so to shape our proposals that they will fit appropriately into the existing general framework.PART II.-REPAIR AND MANAGEMENT OF EXISTING PRIVATELY OWNED WORKING CLASS HOUSES.7. Under paragraph (a) of our terms of reference we were in-structed to consider what, if any, further steps were necessary or desirable to secure the maintenance of a proper standard of fitness for habitation of working-class houses which were not suitable for clearance or demolition under the Housing Act, 1930.8. Previous Commissions&apos; and Committees of Inquiry. That the problem of securing the maintenance of a proper standard of fitness in working class houses is neither new nor easy is shown by the reports of a long succession of Commissions and Committees of Inquiry, from Chadwick&apos;s Report of 1842 to the Reports of the various Committees on the Rent Restrictions Acts, culminating in the recent Report of the Inter-departmental Com-mittee on the Rent Restrictions Acts which was presided over by Lord Marley. Other Reports were those of the Royal Corn-mission of 1885, the Select Committees of 1882 and 1906 and the Unhealthy Areas Committee of 1921.9. So long ago as 1882 the Select Committee on Artisans&apos; and Labourers&apos; Dwellings stated in their Report :-&quot; Tour Committee are of opinion that nothing will con-tribute more to the social, moral and physical improvement of these classes than the improvement of the houses and places in which they live.&quot;** Third para, of the Report from the Select Committee on Artisans&apos; and labourers&apos; Dwellings (1882).
In a Report issued in 1885 the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes stated: &quot; At the very outset of their Inquiry Your Majesty&apos;s Com-missionersi had testimony to prove two important facts : first, that though there was a great improvement,, described . by Lord Shaftesbury as &apos; enormous &apos; in the condition of the houses of the poor compared to that of thirty years ago, yet the evils of overcrowding, especially in London were still a public scandal, and were becoming in certain localities more serious than they ever were; second, that there was much legislation designed to meet these evils, yet that the existing laws were not put into forceAnd in 1906 the Report of the Select Committee on the Housing of the Working Classes Acts Amendment Bill which was con-cerned with conditions in rural districts, stated : &quot; Indifference or want of means among owners of cottage property is a further reason. A good deal of evidence has been submitted showing that there are in villages many owners of cottage property, of a class little removed from the station in life of their tenants, to whom cottage property appeals as a safe investment, and who are indisposed to curtail their profits. Numbers of cottages are owned by persons who are punctual in demanding their rents but do not exercise a corre-sponding responsibility in keeping the cottages in repair. Neg-lect leads to insanitary dilapidation which, unchecked by the local authority, leads to the creation of village slums.&quot;tElsewhere the Committee say : &quot; By strict supervision houses gradually falling into an in-sanitary condition might at slight cost Be made habitable in the early stages. This in turn would pay the owners of the property, because repairs carried out regularly can be done at small cost, whereas neglect entails considerable outlay at. the best, and the demolition order at the worst. Whatever diffi-culties there may be in the way of building new cottages, keeping the existing ones in reasonable repair under the exist-ing law, so as not to be a nuisance or injurious to health, is practicable and ought to be insisted upon.&quot;t10. The most recent inquiry into the matter was that carried out by Lord Marley&apos;s Committee on the Rent Restrictions Acts which reported in July, 1931.   Parts IX and X of the Committee&apos;s report* Para. 4, page 4 of the First Report of Her Majesty&apos;s Commissioners for inquiring into the Housing of the Working Classes (1885).t Para. 27, page (xii) of the Special Report from the Select Committee on Housing of the Working Classes Acts Amendment Bill (1906).X Para. 32, page (xiv) of the Special Report from the Select Committee on Housing of the Working Classes Acts Amendment Bill (1906).
deal with the 25 per cent, increase, which is allowed under the Rent Restrictions Acts for the increased cost of repairs, and with the question of the enforcement of the repairs. The Committee said in paragraph 65 : It is, however, clear that the permitted increase, though not excessive, is now, owing to the fall in costs, sufficient to enable a conscientious landlord to carry out all necessary repairs on an adequate scale. The Reports of the previous Committees leave no room for doubt that the 25 per cent, increase was expressly awarded for this purpose, and, in our view, a tenant has a right to expect that his landlord will do his duty in this respect. &quot;*and again in paragraph 66 : &quot; While, therefore, we make no recommendations for alter-ioig the permitted increase, we are satisfied that owners can no longer claim that the permitted increase is not adequate for its purpose. The evidence which we have received, how-ever, shows that in many districts repairs are not being adequately carried out, although the law provides ample machinery of a varied character for securing that they should be. We feel strongly that every practicable step ought to be taken to see that repairs are properly carried out.&quot;tIt should perhaps be pointed out that in the case of a pre-war working class house of which the net rent in 1914 was 6s., 3s. out of the maximum permitted controlled net rental to-day is definitely associated with and should be regarded as earmarked for the main-tenance in proper repair of the property.  7 16s. a year should be an adequate allowance in ordinary circumstances for this purpose, and we agree with the Marley Committee&apos;s view that &quot; a tenant has a right to expect that his landlord will do&apos; his duty in this respect &quot;.11. The terms &quot; reconditioning &quot; and &quot; fit for human habitation-tion &quot;. It may be desirable to discuss shortly at this stage the term &quot; reconditioning &quot; which is frequently used in connection with this part of our terms of reference. The term &quot; recondition-ing &quot; has no exact meaning; it does not appear in housing legisla-tion. The chief provisions of the Housing Acts in this context relate to the enforcement of repairs. The policy of the Acts is that if a working class house is in any respect unfit for human habitation it should be repaired if the repairs can be carried out at a reason-able cost, having regard to the value of the house when repaired; if not, the house should be demolished.* Para. 65, page 34 of the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Rent Restrictions Acts (1931).t Para. 66, page 34 of the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Rent Restrictions Acts (1931).
12. The expression &quot; fit for human habitation &quot; is defined in Section 62 of the Housing Act, 1930.Sub-section (3) of that section provides that &quot;in determining for the purposes of this Act whether a house is fit for human habitation regard shall be had to the extent, if any, to which by reason of disrepair or. sanitary defects the house falls short of the provisions of any bye-laws in operation in the district, or of the general standard of housing accommodation for the working classes in the district &apos;&apos;.And sub-section (1) of the section defines &quot; sanitary defects &quot; as including &quot; lack of air space or of ventilation, darkness, dampness, absence of adequate and readily accessible water supply or sanitary accommodation or of other conveniences and inade-quate paving or drainage of courts, yards or passages &quot;.13. If we were to attempt to give a definite meaning to the term reconditioning &quot; as distinct from works of repair we should be disposed to define it in some such way as &quot; Such works as are necessary to provide in each tenement or house of good structure a reasonable standard of comfort and convenience at a substantially lower cost than would be incurred by the demolition of such tenement or house and the provision of a new tenement or house &apos;&apos;,and it would appear that it is in such a sense that the term has been used by those who have advocated the policy of reconditioning as an alternative to demolition and replacement.There may be exceptional circumstances in which reconditioning in this sense may be desirable, as, for example, (a) in parts of some large towns such as London where owing to the size of the problem the conditions are special and (b) in some depressed areas where the industrial prospects and the probable diminution of population would not justify the building of new houses.We desire, however, to state unequivocally that, apart from such exceptional cases, we are opposed to the policy of reconditioning as a cheap alternative to the demolition of houses which can and should be demolished as the law stands. Local Authorities are at present engaged on the urgent task of preparing their five year programmes for the clearance and demolition of insanitary pro-perties, and we desire to guard carefully against any possibility of misunderstanding in this matter. The recommendations which we shall make for the acquisition, repair and improvement of properties should be clearly understood as relating, in normal cir-cumstances, only to properties which will not be ripe for demolition during the next five years and will, therefore, not be included in the Local Authorities&apos; clearance programmes.      The proposals
which we shall make, therefore, while they will be complementary tq the Local Authorities&apos; programmes for Improvement Areas, will in no way clash with their programmes for clearance and demolition.14. However complete and ambitious the clearance programmes may be, there will remain outside them an unmeasured amount of deteriorating property and property below modern standards, whose life can, in our view, if suitable measures be taken, be preserved and to some extent1 prolonged to the great benefit both of the tenants and the community and without undue hardship to the existing owners.15. The term reconditioning as used in the subsequent para-graphs of this Report should be understood as normally including works both of repair and of improvement. The extent of the works to be undertaken will necessarily vary from case to case according to the character and condition of the properties, their probable useful life when repaired, and the rental income obtainable when overcrowding has been abated.16. Existing powers. The evidence which we have received is conclusive that the present elaborate code&apos;* under the Public Health, Housing and Rent Restrictions Acts is adequate, if enforced, to enable Local Authorities to require the private owners to put their- properties into good repair. The existing provisions, however, have been seriously criticised on the ground that the powers are not in all cases enforced (in spite of the default powers which are vested in the Minister of Health) and are in only a few cases so diligently exercised as is desirable; and the scope of the powers has also been criticised as inadequate on the ground that the properties are left in the hands of a large number of small private owners, many of whom neither can nor will manage or repair their property satisfactorily. This criticism extends also to the new Improvement Area procedure which the Act of 1930 provides, but which has so far not been largely used. This procedure entails no change of ownership.17. Before exploring whether any completely new departure should be made, it may be well to examine the reasons for the relative failure in the administration of provisions which in them-selves would seem to be adequate for their purpose. In extenua-tion of this failure various reasons were given us in evidence, that most pressed being the existence of a large number of small owners with limited resources who neither can nor will repair satisfactorily and whose management is limited to the collection of their rents. Many Local Authorities, it was stated, hesitate to exercise com-pulsion on owners whose whole capital is in such properties and whose interest in them is in fact often only the equity of a mortgage.   Again, some authorities may not be sufficiently wellA short summary of these provisions is appended (Appendix A).
staffed properly to carry on this branch of their duties and others, for various reasons, may be opposed to any far-reaching plans. Some owners pleaded the burden of the Rent Acts and the difficulties which it placed in the way of good management.We have carefully considered these pleas in mitigation of inaction, but are unable to accept them as adequate. Moreover, there, are some owners, who as a hazardous speculation have deliberately bought up leases with limited terms to run and with no repairing covenant and have been intent on extracting the last penny of rent before their terms expire. The housing shortage enables such landlords to curtail their expenditure on repairs without endanger-ing their income from rents.18. The need for improved management the Octavia Hill system. We think that all the causes referred to in the preceding paragraphs have played a part in producing a highly unsatisfactory result. Some of these factors have operated only since the war, but others, and to our mind the more important factors, are more deep-rooted. We are as much impressed by the need for improved management as for an improved standard of repairs. As is well known, this was the view taken by Miss Octavia Hill and her fellow pioneers when they first approached the problem some 70 years ago. It has often been said that a bad landlord makes a bad tenant, and the converse is not less true. The basic principle of Miss Octavia Hill&apos;s work is the mutual obligation and responsibility which must exist between landlord and tenant if good results are to be obtained. In her view, which we share, management lies at the root of the problem. A good standard of repair without good management is not enough, but in practice the two things normally go together. A good landlord does not wait for a complaint before he orders repairs, still less does he wait for a notice from the Local Authority. Such a policy of management is shortsighted from the landlord&apos;s own point of view and, in a time of housing shortage, inflicts an iniquitous degree of hardship on tenants who can find nowhere else to go. At the present time there are still too many private landlords who allow their properties to be mismanaged in this way, and too many Local Authorities who fail to enforce the law against them.19. The problem of undesirable tenants. It has also been re-presented to us that the possession by a public or quasi-public authority of a number of reconditioned dwellings is a useful means of gradually improving the habits of a limited class of poor tenants who would not normally be accepted by many Local Authorities as tenants of new accommodation or who, if accepted, might misuse the accommodation.We may also mention the experiments in &quot; midway &quot; houses which have been carried out.in Holland.  We did not receive direct
evidence from Holland in regard to these houses but several witnesses referred to them. The houses, we understand, are not reconditioned houses but new houses, of a special type and subject to a specially strict form of supervision, for tenants who are regarded as being of an almost incorrigible type. We are not satisfied that the number of such tenants is other than relatively very small in this country, and we are disposed to think that the policy of isolating them is open to objection.There is, however, a. proportion of undesirable tenants, though their number may be small, and we are strongly of opinion that some adequate provision should be made for them. If they are refused by the responsible authority they merely drift to another neighbouring district and again create there the conditions from which they have just been moved. Octavia Hill in giving evidence before the Select Committee of 1882 said of this class of poor tenant- &quot; I do not believe that this difficulty will ever be met except by a good deal of volunteer work; whether the large Societies will enlist volunteers, or whether it will be done by private enterprise, I do not know; but I am certain that you can hunt, the poor about from place to place, rout them out of one place-and drive them to another; but you will never reach the poor-except through people who care about them ...&quot;While we think that any system of compounds would be neither necessary nor tolerated in this country, we agree with those witnesses who have advocated the housing of such tenants in reconditioned and well-managed dwellings.20. To some extent also houses or tenements of a special form of simplified construction, not provided in isolation but in combination with other blocks of normal type, may be desirable. Simplified dwellings of this type have recently been provided by the London County Council.21. Proposed transfer of deteriorating but repairable property to public or quasi-public ownership. We believe in the prin-ciples of private property and private ownership, but we feel strongly that private ownership, if it is to be retained in the class of property which we are considering, must be efficient and conscientious and cease to be, what -it too often is, an illegitimate gamble on the inactivity of the local authority. Many private owners keep their property in excellent repair and discharge fully the modern obligations of ownership. On the other hand there are, as we have pointed out, many who for a variety of reasons do not. We think that the time has come when this latter class of owner

Since Miss Octavia Hill started her work in 1864 a certain number of Public Utility* and other such Societies, not working for profit, have been formed and provide striking examples of the practical advantage which can be obtained from the transfer of working-class property from a number of small private landlords to responsible public or quasi-public ownership and management on what has come to be known as the Octavia Hill System,There are large numbers of deteriorating working-class houses all over the country, not only in the larger centres of population but also in the smaller and older towns; these properties would afford a most fruitful field for a large extension of the work of the Public Utility Societies, whose operations are at present on a comparatively small scale. We have seen for ourselves examples of the work which has been carried out by such Societies and have compared it with the results which are obtained by the ordinary service of notices under the Housing Acts. We do not find that there is any marked difference between the standard of repairs which can be required under the Housing Acts and that which is secured by Housing Societies as landlords; the important difference lies in the improved management of the houses when they are vested in the Societies and their subsequent maintenance in good repair; whereas when the repaired houses are left in ordinary private ownership they have to be constantly inspected by the sanitary inspectors of the Local Authority to secure that the improved standard is maintained. An extension of the activities of the Societies in this direction would pro tanto relieve the pressure on the Local Authorities&apos; officers and reduce the expenses of inspection which fall upon the local ratepayers.We shall propose that, subject to suitable safeguards, compulsory powers should be granted for the acquisition of working class pro-perties which are not in all respects fit for human habitation, but which if properly repaired and managed will have a reasonable period of life. The principal safeguards from the owners&apos; point of view will be the provisions, which we explain later, exempting from liability to expropriation any owner who can show that his property has in fact been rendered fit, or is included in a voluntary clearance or improvement scheme already submitted to the Minister. At the same time we propose in paragraph 51 below that fit properties may be acquired on the basis of market value if their acquisition is necessary to secure a convenient area for management or to facilitate ultimate redevelopment.23. Employment of House Property Managers. We attach great importance to the employment, wherever practicable, of properly trained house property managers.* A Public Utility Society is a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, the rules whereof prohibit the issue of any share or loan capital with interest or dividend exceeding the rate for the time being prescribed by the Treasury.
We have no wish to exclude from this service the employment of trained, men, but management on the Octavia Hill system involves assistance to the housewife in a number of different ways, and we think that it is therefore desirable that women housing estate managers should usually be employed. The right kind of woman manager has a special aptitude for this class of work. Moreover, it will be appreciated that visits to the home are usually made when the husband is away at work.The number of trained women housing estate managers is at present small, but we are informed that the supply is being deliberately restricted to the limited demand. If our proposals are adopted the demand will be largely increased, and we understand that it will be possible to take immediate steps to increase the supply.24. Financial basis of proposals. It seems to us that the financial practicability and justification of any proposals which we may make for the transfer of privately owned and badly kept work-ing-class houses to public or quasi-public ownership must dependOn--   . ;;; :..   .... - g(a) the price or compensation to be paid for the properties, which must be. such as to allow for the cost of repairing the property after acquisition and for the loss of income which will result from the abatement of overcrowding;(.5) the limitation of expenditure of public moneys on re-pairs and improvement to an amount which the properties will bear; and(c) the pooling of the risks of the various undertakings.We discuss the application of these principles in later paragraphs.25. Basis of compensation.- It may be stated generally that the owner of working class houses is in the position of offering a commodity to the public and has no right to offer a debased or adulterated form of that commodity. If a property is not in all respects fit for human habitation an owner cannot expect to receive the same compensation as if it were. A possible basis of compensation ih such cases is that prescribed in the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, as amended by Part II of the Third Schedule to the Housing Act, 1930, under which the Arbitrator is required to make allowance for the estimated cost of putting the property into a sanitary condition or reasonably good repair, and also to discount enhanced rentals obtained from illegal user or from overcrowding. The objections to this basis for our present purpose are (1) that where so much is left to estimation, the general tendency is to excessive compensation;(2) that in spite of this general tendency hardship might be inflicted on small, owners, who in some cases might receive
little or no compensation and in others would receive in-sufficient to enable them to pay off mortgages or other charges on the property, and(3) that the procedure is slow and relatively expensive.26. It would be possible to amend this basis in such a way as to substitute &quot;fact&quot; for &quot;estimation&quot; by authorising the acquiring authority to&quot; enter and. repair the property before&apos; the assessment of compensation was made. The acquiring authority would have to be strictly controlled in regard to their expenditure on repairs, and this alternative would be open to some of the same objections as the course referred to in the previous paragraph.27. It was suggested to us by the Chief Valuer of the Valuation Department, that, in order to avoid the hardship of dispossessing many owners without compensation, and to afford a basis of com-pensation capable of exact and simple interpretation, - acquisition should be effected on a &quot; refund &quot; basis, i.e. the owner would be given back his money so that he could invest it elsewhere. On this basis the acquiring authority should be authorised to take a transfer of the premises to be acquired on payment of an amount equal to-(a) the purchase price paid by the owner, or(b) if the owner inherited the premises, its principal value accepted for death duties when they passed to him, or(c) if the owner acquired the property by deed of gift, the value adopted for stamp duty purposes.In the case of leasehold interests the payment should be such an apportioned part of the purchase price or the principal value or the value adopted for stamp duty purposes as the number of years of the lease unexpired at the date of acquisition by the acquiring authority bears to the number of years unexpired at the date of acquisition by the lessee, e.g. the price to be paid to a leaseholder who had originally paid  300 for a 50 year lease of which only 10 years were unexpired at the time of acquisition, would be one-fifth of  300, i.e.  60.In cases where the latest transaction in respect of a property to be acquired includes other properties not to be acquired, the apportionment should, failing agreement, be referred to one of the official arbitrators.In all the foregoing cases the amount should be determined by reference to the latest transaction prior to the date of this Report.There, may also be cases, relatively few, to which the refund basis would not be applicable (as, for example, where the existing owner or lessee has erected the premises himself) and we recom-mend that such cases should be settled on the basis laid down in Part II of the Third Schedule to the Housing Act, 1930.
28. The advantages of this proposal may be summarised as follows : - .(1) The compensation payable would be certain in amount and disputes and litigation would be avoided.(2) Premises could be acquired piecemeal with as little delay in procedure as on an everyday transfer on sale.(3) The only costs which would normally be involved would be.the ordinary legal costs of transfer, which would be payable by the acquiring authority.* (4) It is estimated that the owners would, over the whole field, receive approximately the same as on the market value basis as amended by Part II of the Third Schedule to the Plousing Act, 1930. All interests, however, would receive some payment, and both they and the acquiring authority would be saved unnecessary expense in litigation and other such costs.(5) The position of mortgagees would be more or less protected.(6) Acquisition would be simple, direct and expeditious.29. If it be objected that this basis of compensation deprives the owner of speculative or accidental profit resulting from an im-provement in values since he acquired the property, our answer is that this is our deliberate intention. The owner of such property-has no just claim to unearned increment of this character.If it be further objected that this basis pays no regard to any capital expenditure on repairs or improvement incurred by an owner subsequent to his purchase or inheritance of the premises, the answer is that, if the property is at the material date in all respects fit for human habitation, it will be exempt from liability to purchase on the proposed basis; if not, such expenditure has been exhausted and should properly be so regarded.30. Another objection which may be made is that some owners have acquired working class property which they intend to demolish with a view to commercial or industrial development. In such cases it may be said that insufficient allowance is made under our proposals for the value of the unencumbered site, and that such owners should not be required to render fit properties which they de-sire shortly to demolish. We have recommended in a later section of the report that private owners should be given a statutory right to submit to the Minister voluntary Clearance or Improvement Schemes, and these schemes would make provision, inter alia, for alternative accommodation for the persons displaced. We also recommend in paragraph 49 that where such schemes have been submitted to the Minister the owners shall be exempt from liability to expropriation on the proposed new basis. The principle of the new Pent Eestrictions Act is that all owners shall be able to claim possession of their properties if alternative accommodatiou
is available and not otherwise. We regard this principle as unassail-able in a time of housing shortage, and it seems to us to be aques-tion of elementary morality that, no matter for what purpose working class properties are held, the duties of ownership should be fully discharged, and if the properties art to be demolished for&apos; commercial or other reasons, that alternative accommodation should be made available. It can hardly be contended at this date, in view of recent town planning and other legislation, that immediate private advantage should not in cases of this kind give way to the public interest.31. We have very carefully considered the new basis suggested by the Chief Valuer. Clearly anomalies would arise under any system, but we are convinced that the great advantages of the proposal far outweigh the objections, and we recommend its adoption.32. Possible alternatives to acquisition. We have considered a suggestion which has been made to us that, in order to avoid the trouble and expense of acquisition, a scheme for the compulsory transfer of the management of the properties which we have in mind should be devised. There are, however, great and obvious difficulties attendant on the divorce of ownership from control, and we do not consider that it would be practicable to devise a satis-factory scheme on these lines. Nor do we think it practicable to adopt an alternative suggestion, that the owners should be given shares on which interest should be paid out of any revenue which might be available after the properties had been repaired and decrowded and provision made for improved management. It would presumably be necessary to group the properties in a statutory area and assess the relative interest of each owner in such an area. This would require a somewhat complicated valuation. Moreover, the demarcation of a statutory area consisting of semi-slum houses would necessarily be arbitrary, and the owners would have a legitimate grievance if they were penalised because their property fell on the wrong side of an arbitrary line. Further, it is probable that many owners would get little or no interest on their shares. Such a scheme would, in our view, be excessively difficult and complicated, and we are unable to recommend it.33. Scope of the proposals. It is not possible without a compre-hensive survey to state the number of working class properties which it would be desirable or practicable to transfer to responsible owner-ship, but we are strongly of opinion that every owner of a working class house which is not in all respects fit for human habitation should be made liable at law to expropriation on the terms which we have recommended. We think that this published liability will of itself have a salutary effect in inducing those owners who can afford it to put their property quickly into a good state of repair. The scope of the operations of Local Authorities or Public Utility-Societies under these proposals will naturally depend on the different
conditions of each locality and on the extent to which private owners voluntarily put their houses into a good state of repair in order to escape liability to expropriation.34. Circumstances will, no doubt, vary in different localities, but we do mot think that it would be normally desirable or economically sound to acquire for reconditioning properties to which a probable life of 20 years could not be given. Properties which, even when properly repaired and managed, would have a shorter life than 20 years would, in most cases, be ripe for demolition during the next 5 or 10 years and would probably not be suitable for the invest-ment of public funds. The return on the properties would not be sufficient to bear the large sinking fund payments which would be necessary on the basis of so short a period; alternatively, the compensation would have to be much less favourable and would necessarily approximate closely to the equivalent of site value, which is the basis applicable under the Housing Acts to properties which are ripe for demolition.35, There may, however, be cases in which it is desirable to acquire properties on the aiew basis of compensation with a view to their early demolition in order to obtain a rehousing site, and this should be regarded as one of the purposes for which properties which are not in all respects fit may be acquired on this basis.36. Our proposals are, therefore, based on two assumptions : (a) that -properties will not normally be acquired for re-conditioning unless they have or can be given a useful further life of at least 20 years, and(b) that they can be acquired on the simple and expeditious basis which we have suggested, and which we are advised would not throw an undue financial burden on the acquiring authority.37. Extension of new basis of compensation to all statutory pur-poses. We.have recommended in the preceding paragraphs that power should be given to acquire on the refund basis working class properties which are not in all respects fit for human habitation with a view either (a) to their reconditioning or (b) in suitable cases to demolition for the purpose of a rehousing site. These are the principal purposes with which we are concerned, but it seems to us (1) that the purpose for which the properties are needed has no logical connection with the price which the owners should receive, and(2) thai public authorities should be empowered generally to acquire such properties on this basis for any statutory purpose.The point is outside our terms of reference, but we think that in some instances large scale town improvements may in this way be facilitated, and we suggest for consideration that   any owner of  any  working-class  property  which  is not
in all respects fit for human habitation at the material date (i.e. the date of inspection) shall be liable to expropriation on the refund basis, if the property is required by any public authority (as defined by section 12 (2) of the Acquisition of Land (Assess-ment of Compensation) Act, 1919) for any statutory- purpose, sub^ ject to the usual departmental consents. This suggestion does not extend, of course, to demolishable properties for which the site value basis of compensation is prescribed by the Housing Acts. -38. Local administration. We have carefully considered the ques-tion of the most appropriate authority for the administration of these proposals. The obvious authority is the local housing authority, but the evidence which we have received from the representatives of Local Authorities other than those representing the rural areas has been broadly to the effect that no further powers for the authori-ties are necessary or are desired under paragraph (a) of our terms of. reference. There seems to be reluctance on the part of some authorities to become owners of semi-slum property and they have a natural fear of investing the ratepayers&apos; money in decaying pro-perty. They are afraid of throwing good money after bad. We share the view that the latter is a danger which must be avoided and we have, as stated above, framed our proposals on the assump-tion that normally property will not be acquired which cannot be given a probable life of at least 20 years. The general reluctance of the authorities, however, to handle this class of property is an important factor in the situation. Moreover we fear that those Local Authorities who have been lax in the administration of their powers against the owners of defective properties might be equally lax in the administration of the new powers. On the other hand we are opposed to the establishment of a new and large central administrative machine working through local agencies; its opera-tion would be cumbersome and expensive and local interest and enthusiasm would inevitably be lacking.While, therefore, we consider that the new powers of compulsory acquisition should be conferred on the Local Authorities, we con-template that in many areas they will be exercised on the initiative of and on behalf of approved Public Utility Societies, which are already in being or will be brought into existence to meet the undoubted need which exists for the services which they can most appropriately render.39. The Churches and the Rotary Movement have recently-made appeals to their members to take the initiative in help-ing to form such Societies, and the Garden Cities and Town Planning Association have for many years been active in the pro-motion of such Societies. We contemplate that one of the principal functions of the new Central Council, whose appointment we later recommend, will be to promote and assist the formation of Public Societies, and guide them in their work.
. 40. We desire to emphasise the importance of close co-operation between such Societies and the Local Authorities with whom the major, housing responsibility will remain. The best results cannot be obtained without such co-operation. One obvious step which should-be taken by the Societies is to invite members of the-Local Authorities and their housing committees to become members or to assist in&apos; the organisation and management of the Societies. We contemplate that the Minister before approving a Society for the purpose of these proposals will normally require to be satisfied that the Committee of Management includes such members or other persons experienced in local government. It will also usually be desirable to invite a representative of any local building society to. become a member of the Committee of Management.41. In those districts where there is no suitable approved Public Utility Society, or where such a society cannot readily he formed, the Local Authority should be empowered to lease the acquired, properties to House Management Commissioners. The Commis-sioners should be appointed by and ultimately responsible to the Local Authority, but should be given full discretion and indepen-deuce in regard to the details of administration; the Commissioners-should be empowered to co-opt persons experienced in house-management and social welfare. In this way the objection of some authorities to the holding of inferior property might be over-come, and the increased danger of improper electoral pressure which, would otherwise result would be reduced.We contemplate that, if the management of the reconditioned houses by the Societies or the House Management Commissioners, is found by experience to be efficient, a number of Local Authori-ties will desire to consider the transference or leasing to them of; their existing housing estates.42. Method of Operation. We recommend that Local Authorities, should be given compulsory powers and encouraged to acquire working class properties, which are not in all respects fit but can be made fit for human habitation, and to which a probable life, of at least twenty years can be given.Where an approved Public Utility Society exists or can readily be formed the properties should normally be acquired on behalf of the Society who, with the financial assistance which we propose-should be made available to them, will repair, improve and manage the properties.In the absence of such approved Society, the local authority should be empowered to lease the properties to House Management Commissioners. The principal objects of this suggestion have been explained in paragraph 41 above.Where neither of these alternatives is practicable, the Local Authority should be empowered to hold, repair and manage the-[JlUpcl lico    lucmocivoo.
In all cases management should be based on the. Octavia Hill system and wherever practicable Women Housing Estate Managers should be employed.The Local Authority or the Society should provide or secure the provision of sufficient rehousing accommodation to abate over-crowding in the acquired houses, as contemplated in paragraphs 52-54 below. In suitable cases the Local Authorities or the Societies should be authorised to demolish the acquired houses with a view to obtaining a rehousing site as indicated in paragraph 35 above.Accredited officers or members of approved Public Utility Societies should be given such powers of entry as will enable them to exercise effectively the powers which we recommend should be given to them.Where our proposals are to be operated by approved Public Utility Societies, to whom advances will be made under our. pro-posals for the acquisition and reconditioning of the acquired pro-perties and for new building to abate over-crowding in them, we think it important that the general approval of the Central Council (the establishment of which is later recommended) should be obtained to the proposals before action is initiated; and Societies should submit their proposals for advice and general approval to the Central Council at the earliest stage.Having obtained this approval, the Society should ask the Local Authority to serve on the owners of the properties to be acquired the Notices referred to in the next paragraph. When the replies to the Notices have been received, it may be possible for the Society to acquire the properties by agreement at prices which the Central Council will be able to recommend the Minister to approve, and in that case no further difficulty would arise. Where, how-ever, resort to compulsion is necessary the Society, having obtained the general approval of the Central Council, should ask the Local Authority to acquire the properties on their behalf and they should be empowered to submit, if necessary, an official representation to the Local Authority requesting them to exercise their powers of acquisition in regard to properties named in the representation. A copy of the representation should at the same time be sent to the Central Council.If the Local Authority should decline or unduly delay to accede to the Society&apos;s request or to act on such representation, the Society should have a right of appeal to the Minister, who should be em-powered to invest the Society with the compulsory powers of the Local Authority.43. The acquiring authority should serve a Notice on the owners and lessees of the properties to be bought, requiring them, to for-ward within a fixed period a statutory declaration as to the price paid for the properties, or the value accepted for death duties if the property was inherited, or the value adopted for stamp duty if
the property was acquired by deed of gift, and explaining the basis of compensation and their right of appeal on fact to the Minister. A copy of the Notice should be sent to mortgagees so far as they can be ascertained.44. Each property should be judged on its own merits. We con-template that the acquiring authority will normally find it con-venient to submit proposals for dealing with areas or aggregations, of property, but we deliberately refrain from recommending that they shall be required-by law to define an area. The definition of a legal area is apt to leave in the mind of the property owner the idea that his property has been differentiated against because it falls on the wrong side of what he may consider an arbitrary line drawn on a map, and from the point of view of the acquiring authority there is the added objection that the definition of such an area unnecessarily imports questions of law and procedure.The issue to be decided is one of fact the condition of the property and this can best be determined by a visit of inspection by a qualified expert. We see no need to introduce the unnecessary delay and expense of a public local inquiry; the condition of a badly kept working-class house is not a proper subject for forensic argument..45. We, therefore, recommend that the right of appeal of the owner or lessee should be confined to an appeal on fact, i.e., on the ground that he claims that his property is, or will by the time of the inspection have been made, in all respects fit for human habitation. He should be entitled to submit written objection on this ground to the Minister within a period to be prescribed, and the Minister should then be required to inspect the property and decide whether or not it should be exempted. Due notice of the Inspectors visit should be given to the objecting owners and lessees, who should be entitled to be present at the inspection and put their case to the Inspector. The Inspectors report should be made to the Minister, whose decision should be communicated to the objectors, and should be final.46. As previously stated we are not concerned with the question of slum clearance. It seems to us, however, to be a matter for consideration whether the shortened and simplified procedure, which we have recommended in regard to the acquisition of houses for reconditioning, should not be extended with the neces-sary modifications to houses or aggregations of houses which are fit only for demolition or clearance under the Act of 1930.47. If &quot;any owner produces to the Inspector a certificate from the Local Authority, issued since the serving of the Notice, that the property is now in all respects fit for human habitation, such property should be automatically exempted from the refund basis of compensation.
48. The Minister should also consider whether any individual property should be excluded on the ground either (a) that it is too bad for anything except demolition, or (b) that the price to be paid for it is excessive, having regard to its probable useful life, the cost of repairs, and the loss of income resulting from the abatement of overcrowding. In either case the Local Authority&apos;s attention should be specially directed to the property with a view to action under the Housing Act, 1930.49. It will be seen that under these proposals any owner, or lessee who at the date of the inspection either(a) produces a certificate from the Local Authority that the house is now fit for habitation, or(b) satisfies the Inspector that the house is so. fit,will be exempt from liability to expropriation on the proposed basis, though the property may be acquired on the basis of market value under paragraph 51.Further, we propose in a later paragraph that owners should be given the right (subject to certain provisos) to submit to the-Minister voluntary clearance or improvement schemes. If this proposal is accepted, we recommend that any property included in such a scheme, which had been submitted to the Minister before the date of the Inspectors visit, should be excluded from liability to acquisition on the new basis.We propose a further safeguard for the owners. Some owners on whom a Notice referred to in paragraph 43 has been served will doubtless require an. assurance that the work which they pro-pose to carry out will be regarded as sufficient (as otherwise on the refund basis of compensation their expenditure will be irre-coverable). We propose, therefore, that owners shall be given the right to demand from the Local Authority a list of the works needed to make the houses in all respects fit for human habitation, and a statement that, if such works are carried out before the date of inspection, the certificate referred to in paragraph 47 will be granted.We consider that in these ways the owners&apos; legitimate interests will be fully safeguarded.50. In view of the emphasis which we have laid on the necessity for improved management, there may seem to be inconsistency in our proposal to exempt the owner whose property has been made fit, but, as we have said earlier in the report, good management and a good standard of repair usually go together ; and moreover we think it almost certain that in view of the age of many of the properties and the poverty of many of the owners, large tracts of property will remain to be dealt with. If, however, a very large proportion of the properties should be made in all respects fit by the owners in order to escape expropriation, one of our two major objects would! have been achieved with the minimum of trouble and expenditure.!
51. It may be necessary in a few cases to acquire fit properties for the purpose of securing a&apos; convenient area for management or to facilitate ultimate redevelopment, or because they are obstructive buildings which should be demolished in order to let in light and ^air to other properties. Such properties should be acquired on the basis of market value as modified by Part II of the Third Schedule to the Housing Act, 1930. The acquisition of such properties would be analogous to the acquisition under section 3 of the Housing Act, 1930, of properties surrounded by or adjacent to a clearance area and the basis of compensation in such cases is that prescribed in Part II of the Third Schedule of that Act referred to above.52: Rehousing of Displaced Persons. Much of the property to be acquired is overcrowded, and the very improvements which it will be necessary in some cases to effect may reduce the available amount of habitable accommodation. It is clear, therefore, that the acquiring authority must be empowered to provide or secure the provision of sufficient new rehousing accommodation to abate the overcrowding in the acquired houses. We recommend that such rehousing should earn a rehousing subsidy. The principle of our proposals is already to some extent contained in the Improvement Area procedure which the Act of 1930 provides, and a rehousing grant under that Act is available for persons displaced to abate over-crowding in Improvement Areas. Our proposals are not limited to Improvement Areas and the new factors which are introduced are those of purchase and management.53. Where the acquiring authority is the Local Authority no further powers for the acquisition of sites are necessary. Local Authorities appear already to have the necessary compulsory powers to acquire sites on behalf of Public Utility Societies. If there is any doubt on this latter point, it should be removed, and Local Authorities should be encouraged to use their powers on behalf of approved Societies. In the case of refusal or undue delay on the part of the Local Authority, the powers should be made exerciseable by the Society as recommended in paragraph 42 above in regard to properties to be acquired for reconditioning.54. In some cases properties acquired for reconditioning may be found on examination after acquisition, in spite of the safeguards which we propose, to be incapable of repair at reasonable expense, and in such cases the acquiring authority should be enabled, with the consent of the Minister, to demolish such properties and use the site, if suitable, for the provision of new accommodation. In considering such an application the Minister would, of course, have regard to the price paid for the properties and the general suitability of the site for rehousing,55. Conditions of subsidy. The special subsidy conditions for Local Authorities are set out in section 27 of the Act of 1930 and those for Public Utility Societies in section 29.   The principal
condition relates to the rents to be charged for the new accommo-dation; the rents of houses provided by the Local Authority must not exceed the estimated annual expenses less the equivalent of the Exchequer subsidy and a compulsory contribution from the rates of  3 15s. Qd. per house per annum for 40 years. Where houses are provided by Public Utility Societies, the Societies are required to charge rents not exceeding the rents which might have been charged by the Local Authority if they had themselves provided the houses. It will be seen that, if the Local Authority do rot pay to the Society the contribution which they would have been required to make if they had undertaken the work themselves, it is impossible for the Society to satisfy the rent conditions of the Act unless they are able either to build more cheaply than the Local Authority or to raise from charitable sources a sum approxi-mately equivalent to the  3 15s. Od. Moreover, the Public Utility Societies, where they have to acquire the site themselves, are at a disadvantage in that they are normally unable to acquire a site so cheaply as the Local Authority who are armed with compulsory powers, but for the purpose of the rent calculation the price which the Local Authority would have paid for the site &quot;is taken into account and not the price actually paid by the Society. It has been represented to us that under these conditions it is almost impossible for a Public Utility Society to operate under the Housing Act, 1930.56. We do not think that it is practicable to compel Local Authorities to make a contribution from the rates, and we think it is undesirable that Public Utility Societies should be debarred from the advantage of the subsidy payable under the Act of 1930 because they may not be able to raise the equivalent of the con-tribution from charitable sources.We, therefore, consider that the rent condition applicable to rehousing by Public Utility Societies under the Act of 1930 requires amendment, but as the point is outside our terms of reference we make no recommendation.We have had regard however to these difficulties in considering the subsidy which should be. paid in aid of rehousing provided under our proposals, and we recommend that the condition should be that the rents (exclusive of rates) to be charged by the Societies should not exceed on the average 2s. 9d. per habitable room in tenements of more than three storeys (on expensive sites as defined in section 26 (3) of the Act of 1930) and Is. 6d. per habitable room in any other new accommodation.57. Basis, period, amount and form of rehousing subsidy. (a) for Public Utility Societies. The present subsidy under the Act of 1930 is an annual sum payable for 40 years based on the number of persons displaced from demolished houses, or to abate overcrowd-ing in an Improvement Area.   It appears to us that, for the purpose
2588of rehousing under our proposals, the present subsidy is excessive in amount and that its basis and form can with advantage be simplified.We propose that the new subsidy shall be based on the number of new houses or tenements approved by the Minister as being necessary to abate overcrowding in the acquired houses, and shall be an annual sum payable for 60 years (which is the period for redemption of the principal loan moneys). In considering the amount of subsidy required we have had regard to the average figures of rent per room which we have proposed in the preceding paragraph : on these figures the average rent of a three-bedroomed house will be 6s. per week plus rates, and of a three-roomed tenement 8s. 3d. per week plus rates. We think that these would be reasonable average rents, and the subsidy should not be larger than is necessary to achieve them.We are advised that the average all-in cost (including land, roads, sewers, etc.) of a three-bedroomed house will be of the order of  350 and of a three-roomed tenement  600, and that the allow-ance for repairs, management, etc. may be taken at  5 10s. p.a. for the house and  8* for the flat; on this -basis the subsidies needed to permit of the prescribed rents being charged without loss to the Society are:  5 per house for 60 years and  12 per tenement for 60 years.We recommend subsidies at these rates, subject to revision in the circumstances contemplated in paragraph 61 below.58. As regards the form of the subsidy, the suggestion was made to us by Mr. Rowe, of the Improved Tenements Association, that the subsidy should take the form of a reduction in the rate of interest payable on loan advances. It seems to us that the chief arguments against this proposal are (1) that the adoption of such a method would tend to conceal the fact that a subsidy was being paid, whereas it is a matter of some importance that the existence of a subsidy should not be concealed and (2) that, while the con-tinuance of the subsidy would be conditional on the continued charging of rents within the prescribed figure, and would be forfeited in the event of a breach of this condition, the financing authority under Mr. Eowe&apos;s proposal would, by executing a-mortgage at a reduced rate of interest, unconditionally grant the subsidy for the period of the mortgage, and so would lose control. While the proposal clearly has the merit of convenience, we think that on balance the weight of argument is against it.59. We desire, however, to avoid the cumbersome procedure by which subsidy is paid by one Government Department to a Society who return it to another Government Department in the form of* This figure includes an allowance for stair lighting, caretaker, etc.
 	s.	d.= 350	0	0315	0	0-----   12	18	45	0	0loan charges. We, therefore, recommend that the grant-paying authority, on being satisfied that the conditions have been observed, should issue to the grantee Society a certificate remitting part of the loan charges to an amount equivalent to the subsidy due, and should pay this amount direct to the financing authority with in-structiohs to credit the payment to the grantee Society. Our pro-posal is shown in the following illustration : Cost of new house   ... Amount of advance (say) ... Loan charges on the basis of interest at(say) 3-f per cent,  and repayment in60 years    ...      ...       ...       ...Annual subsidyHaving given a certificate of remission, the grant-paying authority would pay  5 to the financing authority and the Society would pay the balance of  1 18s. 4d.60.  (b) For Local Authorities. The preceding paragraphs deal with subsidy for Public Utility Societies. We do not think that Local Authorities should be relieved of their present obligation to make a contribution from the rates or that it would be right to have a different level of rents for houses provided by Public Utility Societies and Local Authorities. We therefore recommend that the subsidy suggested for Public Utility Societies should in its appli-cation to Local Authorities be reduced by an amount equivalent to the rate contribution. A smaller rate contribution than that which is at present made under the Act of 1930 may well be considered appropriate. We make no recommendation, however, as to the amount of the contribution, which we consider is a matter to be settled by the Minister after consultation with the Local Authorities.The proposal that subsidy should be paid direct to the financing authority by the grant-paying authority would not apply to the schemes of Local Authorities, who for the most part make their own arrangements for raising capital.61. Revision of subsidy. It seems to us that there are two sets of circumstances in which revision of the subsidy would be necessary : (1) The subsidy should be subject to a condition that it shall be open to review amd possible reduction in the event of any large general improvement in economic conditions. Por example, a substantial improvement in the rent paying capacity of the working classes or a large reduction in the number of tenants needing subsidised accommodation in a given locality
would constitute a ground for revision. It should be under-stood that, while such a revision would apply to houses already provided, it would not be at the expense of the Society or its shareholders.&apos; (2) In arriving at the suggested figures of subsidy we have had regard to existing levels of cost. We are, however, far from accepting the position that no further economies can be made in the planning and construction of working class dwellings. In particular we consider that the present cost of tenement flats is excessive and that there is an urgent need for further examination of the technical and other problems in-solved. It may be that the solution will be found in new methods of planning or construction, or in the use of new materials, or in a combination of both. We have received a paper from the British Steelwork Association which suggests that the amendment of the London Building Acts, which is at present under consideration by a Committee of the London County Council, may materially assist dn the solution of some of the difficulties, and we are aware that the Ministry of Health as well as a number of architects and private firms are giving much thought to the possibilities of reducing costs. We regard it as important that any necessary amendment of the London Building Acts should be pressed forward without delay, and that every encouragement should be given to those who are engaged in investigating the technical aspects of the problem. While, therefore, we have no alternative but to make our recommendation on the basis of existing costs and existing knowledge, we consider that the position should be reviewed at frequent intervals with a view to reductions of the subsidy in proportion as it may be found possible to reduce costs. Such reductions would, of course, not be applicable to houses or tenements which had already been provided.62. Capital Expenditure. Local Authorities, to the extent to which they operate our proposals, will be able to raise the necessary -sary capital in the usual way either from the money market or from the Public Works Loan Board and will need no special assistance.63. The position is different in regard to Public Utility Societies. Under the existing law a Public Utility Society can obtain from the Public Works Loan Board an advance not exceeding two-thirds of the value of the properties to be mortgaged; the period of repay-ment for such loan is limited to 50 years for the purpose of the provision of new houses or 40 years for any other purpose. Alterna-tively, under section 92 of the Housing Act, 1925, a Society can obtain an advance not exceeding 90 per cent, from a County Council or Local Authority; the period and other conditions of the advance are such as the Minister approves and the period allowed does not
normally exceed 40 years. At the same time it should be pointed out that under section 70 of the Housing Act, 1925, a Local Autho-rity or County Council has power to promote the formation of or to assist a Public Utility Society by the acquisition of land, by grants or loans, by the subscription of any share or loan capital and by guaranteeing the payment of interest on money borrowed by the Society or on any share or loan capital issued by the Society. No restrictions on the amount of the assistance to. be given are specified, but assistance may be given only with the consent of and subject to any regulations or conditions made or imposed by the Minister. And under section 91 of the Housing Act, 1925, Local Authorities are empowered to make advances to private owners (including, apparently, Public Utility Societies) to assist them to carry out works for the reconstruction, enlarge-ment or improvement of houses; the amount of the advance must not exceed one-half of the estimated value of the property unless some additional or collateral security is given as security for the excess.64. These provisions have been criticised by the representatives of the Societies on various grounds. Many Local Authorities are said to be reluctant to use their powers of granting assistance and the period within which repayment must be made is too short to allow of sufficiently low rents being charged. Advances from the Public Works Loan Board, on the other hand, are restricted to two-thirds of the estimated value of the properties and the method of valuation is said to be so strict that in practice the Societies usually obtain very much less than they anticipated. Generally it Is stated that it is extremely difficult for voluntary societies to raise the remaining one-third or smaller fraction of the amount required, as it is this last fraction which carries the whole risk without any hope of compensating profit. In practice the money, to the extent to which it is found, is found by means of appeals to the charitable and the scope of the Societies&apos; work has been ham-hampered and limited by the difficulty of raising it. As Mr. B. P. P. Bowe, of the Improved Tenements Association, put it to us &quot; The housing society, faced with the need of a loan of  50,000, on which the utmost it can pay is 3 per cent, (if it is to house the poorest), meets with the following experience. After much propaganda it arranges a big meeting with . . . the Minister of Health, and an ex-Prime Minister, or others equally eminent, among the speakers. By this means, and with the aid of further propaganda, it raises  20,000 at 3 per cent, in a year. Then, as subscribers complain that nothing is being done and hint at the return of their money, the Society takes a plunge and during the next year (in which, with luck, it raises a further  10,000) builds the 80 flats. It is thus left with a debt of  20,000, which it finances somehow, but at a
greater cost than 3 per cent., so that the rents have finally to be put above the average of, say, 4s. per room, including rates, originally aimed at. This is not. an exaggerated case but about normal.&quot;65. If the work of the Societies is to be largely extended, as we contemplate, it is clearly necessjary that much more adequate financial facilities&apos;should b,e made available to them.It will be necessary for them to incur capital expenditure on three different purposes :  (a) the acquisition of properties;(b) repairs and improvement; and(c) new building to rehouse persons displaced to abate over-crowding in the acquired houses.66. Acquisition. We have already pointed out that in our view the price to be paid for properties should not exceed the value they would bear if the owner were required to carry out the obligations of ownership in regard to the maintenance of a proper standard of fitness for human habitation; and we have indicated the basis of compensation which we consider should be adoped. We recommend that the Central Financing Authority (see paragraph 70) should be empowered to advance the requisite sums to approved Public Utility Societies, whose proposals have been examined and approved by the Minister on the advice and recommendation of the Central Public Utility Council, the establishment of which is later recommended.67. Repairs and Improvement. As previously stated in para-graph 24, we consider that the expenditure of public monies on repairs and improvement should be limited to an amount which the properties will bear. We, therefore, propose that the Societies should be required to furnish a statement of the estimated rental income of the properties, on the basis that overcrowding has been abated, together with an estimate of the cost of repairing the properties.The Central Financing Authority should then be empowered, on the advice of the Central Council, to advance to the Society such sum as may be necessary to enable them to repair the properties, provided always that the loan, charges on this sum when added to the loan charges on the amount of the purchase price must not exceed the estimated rental income of the properties after an adequate allowance has been made for repairs, management, etc. The following table shows the maximum advances which would be permissible under our proposals for acquisition and recon-reconditioning, according to the different levels of rent obtainable and the different probable periods of life of the acquired properties. -23012-     ,    - -.- b   &apos;

The higher rents contemplated are those for houses let to more than one family.Calculations are based on a rate of interest of 3f per cent, and on the assumption that 40 per cent, of the net rent will be required for repairs, management, etc., i.e., that 60 per cent, of the net rent will be available for service of the loan.68. We realise that in many cases a Society may wish or may find it necessary to carry out more extensive repairs or improve-ments than can be met out of an advance so limited. Such further expenditure will fall to be met from the Society&apos;s own funds. We regard it as important that each Society should have a financial interest in the efficient conduct of the undertaking, and we consider that we have already gone to the limit of financial prudence in recommending an advance from the Government representing 100 per cent, of the cost of purchase and of such repairs and improve-ments as the estimated rentals will bear.In some cases the Societies may be able to obtain financial assistance from the Local Authorities. Some Societies are already working in friendly agreement with Local Authorities, and we hope that under our proposals there will be many more instances of such useful co-operation. As the success of the Societies&apos; work will result in an improvement in local housing conditions for which the Local Authority are responsible, we consider that Local Authorities should exercise more freely their powers under section 70 of the Act of 1925 to assist the Societies either by subscribing to the Societies&apos; share capital or guaranteeing the interest on it or both.69. Hew building to rehouse persons displaced to abate over-crowding. The Central Financing Authority should have power to make advances for the provision of new accommodation to rehouse persons displaced to abate overcrowding in the acquired houses. Here again we think it desirable that every effort should be made to secure that each Society has some financial stake in the success of the undertaking. We, therefore, recommend that, while the Cen-tral Financing Authority should be empowered to make advances where necessary up to 100 per cent, of the estimated value of the
Estimated Annual Expenditure.   s. d.Repairs, management,etc..........      5 10   0Loan charges (3f percent.; 60 years) on 315   (i.e.,  90 percent, of  350)      ...    12 18   4      18   8   4Balance out of which interest on share capital of  35 wouldbe met      ...      ... 2   3   8 = 6.23per cent.Note. On the above basis every variation of  10 in the cost of a house of the above accommodation (within limits of  20 up or down) would affect the surplus balance by a sum representing approximately li per cent, on the share capital. Every variation of   per cent, in the rate of interest charged on the mortgage loan or 7s. 6d. in the annual cost of repairs, management, etc., would affect the surplus balance by a sum representing approximately 1 per cent, on the share capital.* The prescribed maximum rate of interest for the share capital of Public Utility Societies is at present 6 per cent. Societies operating under our proposals should, we think, be limited to 5 per cent.properties, advances should normally be limited to an amount not exceeding 90 per cent., and the Societies should normally be required to raise at least 10 per cent, of the capital required by the issue of shares bearing interest not exceeding 5 per cent.* The holders of such shares would own the equity of the properties. By the ordinary operations of the sinking fund, the security of the shares should improve year by year, and the following calculations show that, if management is efficient, there should be no difficulty in meeting the interest on the shares from the outset: Non-parlour three-bedroomed house.Assumptions:  .     s. d.All-in cost   ....     ...      ......... ... 350   0   0Maximum permissible weekly rent (Is. 6d. perroom exclusive of rates)         ...       ... ... 6   0Annual Income.    s. d.Bent................      15 12 0Subsidy       ...      .........       5   0 0Total    ......      20 12   0

On the above basis every variation of  10 in the cost of a flat of the above accommodation would affect the surplus balance by a sum re-presenting approximately 15s. Od. per cent, on the share capital. Every variation of -J- per cent, in the rate of interest charged on the mortgage loan or of 12s. Od. in the annual cost of repairs, management, etc., would affect the surplus balance by a sum representing approximately 1 per cent, on the share capital.The Central Council may be able to assist in making arrange-ments for the shares of the larger and better known Societies to be marketed on the principal Stock Exchanges and generally to give advice to the Societies in regard to their financial arrange-ments:70. The Central Financing Authority. We recommend that the capital advances to Public Utility Societies should be made by the Minister of Health.We are not aware of a precedent for this suggestion, but from evidence we have received from the Treasury we understand that such functions could not appropriately be discharged by the Public
Works Loan Board, and we think that, in preference to the creation of an ad hoc organisation, the functions should be discharged by the Minister, at least- until the scope of the operations can be measured.71. We contemplate that the Minister will obtain the necessary funds from the National Debt Commissioners. It may, however, be desirable for the Government to consider the issue of a special housing loan, in order that advantage may be taken of.the great and growing public interest in the housing of the working classes. The Minister should be guided in his administration of the funds at his disposal by the advice and recommendations of the Central Public Utility Council.72. The Minister should also administer the common reserve fund, the establishment of which we recommend in a later paragraph.73. We appreciate that our proposals, which involve advances up to 100 per cent, for certain purposes, necessarily involve an element of risk, and we are well aware of the criticisms which can be made of even a partial separation of financial and administra-tive responsibility.It seems to us, however, that the psychology of an approved Public Utility Society to which a 100 per cent, capital advance has been made for the purchase of property is essentially different from that, for example, of a Local Authority under the Housing Act of 1919 whose liability for any deficiency on revenue account was limited in advance to a fixed amount. The approved Society will know that, if they do not administer efficiently, they will be liable to be replaced and so will lose the work and interest which they have invested in the scheme; and their officers will know that they may lose their posts. The Society may&apos; indeed have a temptation to spend too much on the acquisition and initial repairing of the property, but this danger can and will be met by the safeguards which we have proposed ; thereafter they will have a strong incentive to be economical and efficient in the management of the property.74. A central executive organisation, centrally financed, is of course one logical extreme which we might have recommended; and the extreme opposite alternative would be a local administra-tion financed exclusively from local resources. The first of these alternatives we have rejected for the reasons given earlier in the Eeport; the second would be practicable only if our proposals were to be administered exclusively by Local Authorities who have the financial resources of the local rates. This second alternative we have also rejected as impracticable and undesirable; we hope indeed that Local Authorities will play a prominent part in the operation of our proposals, but, for the reasons which we have already given, we think it essential that the Public Utility Societies
should be encouraged and enabled to play a large and&apos; important part in work which in our view they are especially well fitted to undertake.75. We see no sufficient reason why central finance, with proper safeguards, should be incompatible with local administration by independent societies. He who pays the piper calls the tune, but he does not play the pipe. We have, accordingly, worked out a careful scheme of Exchequer finance for approved Public Utility Societies, and we think that the safeguards which we have devised to protect the Exchequer from the danger of serious loss will be effective.   It may be well here briefly to describe them : (1) Assistance will be given only to Societies approved by the Minister on the recommendations of the Central Council, who before making any such recommendation will pay special attention to the qualifications of the managing personnel, and will satisfy themselves not only that the Society has been formed with the single object of service, but that the managing committee includes persons able to carry out our proposals with businesslike efficiency.  1(2) The proposals of the Societies will be examined and generally approved in their initial stage by the Central Council.(3) The Central Council will have at its disposal the best technical advice, and should be satisfied before recommending the Minister to make an advance that the reconditioning proposed will be economically sound and that the re-con-ditioned property will command a rent fully sufficient (after deduction of the expenses of repair, management, etc.), to cover the loan charges on the advance.(4) With careful administration there should not be any loss on the administration of the scheme by any Society, but if serious default should occur the powers of the mortgage could immediately be exercised and possession of the property taken.(5) In paragraph 78 we have proposed the establishment of a common reserve fund designed to meet losses arising from such default.(6) The repayment of the advances for purchase and re-conditioning will be based on comparatively short periods and the outstanding amount of any advance will, therefore, be reduced at a fairly rapid rate; for example, the outstanding balance would be reduced to 75 per cent, of the original advance in 7 years where the repayment is based on 20 years, in 9 years where the repayment is based on 25 years.(7) It may not be found necessary, when Societies have become well established, to make the maximum advance of 100 per cent, for acquisition and re-conditioning. Experience suggests that the difficulties of raising private capital diminish
as a Society acquires credit by the successful carrying out of schemes. Wheii operations have become extensive the total advances would normally represent considerably less than the whole capital expenditure of the Society and the Society itself would have a substantial financial stake in the sound . administration of their properties.76. We appreciate that in spite of these safeguards loss may be incurred, but in our opinion the risk is one which can be minimised by careful administration and is in any case one which it is well worth while to incur. There must always be a degree of risk in making an advance for more than the normal proportion of the value of the security. There is, for example, an element of risk in the 90 per cent, guaranteed advances contemplated under Section 2 of the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1933, which has just been passed into law.We think that if our proposals are accepted and the slight risk which they involve is faced, there will be no need for a subsidy for reconditioning as such in urban areas. The cost of recon-reconditioning is widely variable, and a variable subsidy would be extremely difficult to administer without an excessive degree of central control.It would, however, be within our terms of reference to recommend a subsidy, which might, for example, take tne form of a lump sum subsidy equivalent to the difference between too amount of a safe advance and the full amount of capital required by a Society. But this would be a very expensive alternative to the proposals which we have made.In view of all the circumstances, we recommend that the Government should incur the relatively slight risk which pur proposals involve.77. Margin for administrative expenses. We recommend that the interest charged on advances should include a percentage for management expenses, so that when operations become sufficiently extensive the administration of the scheme may become self-supporting.78. Common Reserve Fund. We recommend that, in order to minimize the risk of loss to the Exchequer, a common reserve fund should be set up and administered by the Central Financing Authority (i.e. the Minister see para. 70 above).The Minister, on the advice of the Central Council, should be empowered to determine the amount of any surplus revenue which may be allocated by a Society to its own reserve fund and any balance remaining should be paid by the Society into the common reserve fund.Before advising the Minister, the Central Council should confer with the Society, and regard should be had to the measure of financial assistance accorded to each Society in deciding how much of its surplus revenue it may retain in its own reserve fund.
The recommendation for a common reserve fund is limited to undertakings assisted by the Government under our proposals and does not extend to other activities of the Societies which they carry out without such financial assistance.It will, of course, be necessary that separate accdunts should be kept of&apos; undertakings or parts of undertakings which are financed under our proposals, and the Societies will be required to submit their accounts to such audit as the Minister may determine.79. Proposed new Central Public Utility Council. Not all ex-isting Public Utility&quot; Societies are equally experienced or efficient. Many new Public Utility Societies will, we hope, shortly be formed and will necessarily be lacking in experience. It is only to approved Public Utility Societies that the new facilities which we recommend should be available. We think it essential for the success of our proposals that a strong Central Public Utility Council should be appointed by the Minister of Health.80. The principal functions of the Central Council would be :  (a) Subject to the general directions of the Minister of Health, to stimulate the formation, and supervise the operations, of Public Utility Societies and generally from time to time to give such help and guidance as the Societies may need.The Garden Cities and Town Planning Association already perform a valuable work in the promotion and assistance of Public Utility Societies, and the Central Council might be able to arrange for some of this part of their work to be undertaken by the Association. It would, in any case, be necessary to work in close co-operation with the Association.(b) To advise and make recommendations to the Minister as to the approval of such Societies for the purpose of the local administration of our proposals where they are not carried out by the Local Authorities.(c) To advise and make recommendations to the Minister in regard to the proposals of Public Utility Societies or Local Authorities for the acquisition, repairing, and managing of properties.(d) To advise and make recommendations to the Minister as to the amount of advances to be made to Public Utility Societies.(e) To study and advise the Minister, Local Authorities and Public Utility Societies in regard to questions of house manage-ment; and to take steps to ensure an adequate supply of trained property managers.(/) To study and collate information and experience as to the best methods of different kinds of reconditioning.(g) To facilitate and encourage co-operation between local Housing Authorities, Public Utility Societies and private persons interested in voluntary housing activities.
The Council might usefully consider the promotion of a non-statutory Housing Association or league for the purposes of propaganda and as a common meeting ground for all &apos;. municipal   and   voluntary   workers   interested   in   housing problems.   The Minister should be authorised to make a small .&apos; grant for this purpose.81. We recommend that the Central Council should consist of not more than five persons, including the Chairman, and that they should be paid on a part-time basis. At least one member should have special financial qualifications. The staff should be appointed by the Minister of Health.The selection and appointment of members of the Council must, of course, be left to the Minister, but we desire to record our opinion that to ensure the success of a new and difficult service it is of the first importance that the post of Chairman should be filled if possible by some eminent person of standing and experience both of municipal and voluntary housing activities.PART HI.-MISCELLANEOUS SUGGESTIONS FOR AMENDMENTS TO THE LAW.82. We have considered a number of suggestions for amendment to the law in various respects.83. Definition of an Improvement Area. It was suggested to us that the definition of an Improvement Area in Section 7 (1) of the Housing Act, 1930, should be amended so that an area could be declared on any one of the grounds mentioned in the subsection. Under section 7 an area can only be declared an Improvement Area if the housing conditions are dangerous or injurious to the health of the inhabitants by reason of disrepair or sanitary defects in the dwelling-houses, combined with overcrowding in the area or the bad arrangement of the houses or the narrowness or bad arrangement of the streets. The primary object and effect, therefore, of the suggestion would be to enable any overcrowded area to be declared an Improvement Area, so that the rehousing provided to abate such overcrowding would rank for subsidy under the Housing Act, 1930.Except in so far as overcrowding is one of the factors militating against the maintenance of a proper standard of fitness for habitation-tion, the suggestion falls outside our terms of reference. Apart from this consideration, we think that the proposed amendment would be much too wide and, if adopted, would go far to undermine the policy of the Government in terminating subsidy under the Act of 1924 and seeking to re-attract private enterprise to the pro-vision of working-class houses.   Our recommendation, however,21012 c
that a rehousing grant should be available for abating overcrowding in houses acquired under our proposals will, we think, to a large extent meet the necessities of the case without endangering the position of private enterprise.84. Amendment of special conditions as to rent under the Housing Act, 1930, applicable to rehousing by Public Utility Societies. We have dealt with this suggestion in paragraph 56.85. Voluntary Schemes by owners. It was suggested to us by the Garden Cities and Town Planning Association that a Public Utility Society should be empowered to submit a voluntary clearance or improvement scheme direct to the Minister. A similar suggestion was put forward by Earl Win-terton in regard to ordinary private owners. Under the Housing Act, 1930, a Public Utility Society can enter into an agreement with the Local Authority to carry out rehousing operations, and, if subsidy is to be obtainable under that Act, the Local Authority has to go through the formality of making a Clearance Order on the property of the Society or alternatively purchasing the pro-perty and reconveying it to the Society. The object of the Garden Cities and Town Planning Association was to get rid of the delays and difficulties, which may attend this somewhat cumbersome procedure, and they based their suggestion on the precedent of voluntary schemes in town planning legislation. The object of the suggestion in regard to other private owners was to obtain the statutory right to clear and improve the property without waiting for an Order from the Local Authority or incurring the risk of having the scheme interfered with at a later stage by the Local Authority. It was suggested that a scheme of this kind should be submitted to the Local Authority for approval in the first instance; and that, when a scheme had been approved by the Minister, the owner should be granted all the facilities of a local housing authority as, for example, in dealing, with tenants protected under the Pent Restrictions Acts.86. We recommend that all private owners, including Public Utility Societies, should be given the statutory right to submit clearance or improvement schemes direct to the Minister, provided that such schemes are limited (a) to schemes agreed with all owners and lessees, and (b) to properties not included in clearance areas under the Local Authorities&apos; five years programmes. The Minister before approving them would obtain the views of the Local Authority and arrange for an inspection of the properties. The Minister should be empowered to pay subsidy (on the reduced basis which we have recommended) in aid of rehousing accommo-dation provided by Local Authorities or Public Utility Societies for persons displaced from properties required under the scheme to be demolished or to abate overcrowding in houses to be reconditioned, provided that the special conditions as to rent, etc., are observed.
The new loan facilities which we recommend for Public Utility Societies should extend to rehousing schemes of this character, if carried out by such Societies.It will be appreciated that under our main proposals a freeholder who desires, that his property should be kept in good repair, but has let it .to a lessee who is not so keeping it, will be able to ask the Local Authority to acquire the leasehold interest. The Local Authority will be able, with the Minister&apos;s consent under section 59 of the Housing Act, 1925, to convey the leasehold interest to the freeholder, subject to such covenants and conditions as they may think fit to impose. The freeholder will then, having resumed full ownership, be in a position to repair or recondition the property; and the Minister&apos;s consent should not be given unless an undertaking to this effect has been obtained.87. We think that a provision on these lines would be a useful supplementary means of securing the voluntary clearance and im-provement of slum areas.A further advantage would be that owners would be given the opportunity to redevelop their property on economic lines, while making adequate provision for alternative accommodation for the working class persons displaced. In the absence of such a provision there might be a danger that our main proposals would in some cases have the result of stereotyping the existing user of the land for housing purposes, although it might be desirable from both the economic and the town planning points of view to re-develop it in part for other purposes. If owners were given the right to submit voluntary schemes, it would be a corollary that our main proposals should not be made applicable to properties included in such schemes which had been submitted to the Minister.88. We are not prepared, however, to support the suggestion that the owner should be freed from the restrictions of the Rent Restrictions Acts. Under the new Rent Restrictions Act any owner will be able to apply for possession if alternative accommoda-tion is available, and the definition of such accommodation has been extended. It does not seem to us that any further powers should be necessary.89. Definition of fitness for human habitation. We have been asked to attempt to define more precisely the phrase &quot;fit for human habitation.&quot; We have, in an earlier paragraph, set out the definition in section 62 of the Housing Act, 1930, and we do not think it practicable to restate the definition with any greater precision.90. Provision of capital for private owners to carry out works of repair, improvement, etc. The representatives of the Property Owners and others suggested that further financial facilities should be made available to private owners who wished to carry out worksIof repair and improvement to their properties. 21012 o 2
It may be useful if we draw attention to the existing powers.Under section 92 of the Housing Act, 1925, Local Authorities have power, with the Ministers consent, to lend money to persons or bodies of persons altering or undertaking to alter houses; and this provision is, by section 47 of the Housing Act, 1930, extended to include advances to persons or bodies of persons carrying out or undertaking to carry out repairs in any case where the Local Authority consider that, having regard to the cost of the repairs or the financial position of the applicant, it is reasonable to grant such assistance.Under the Rent Restrictions Acts a landlord since 1920 has been able to increase the rent by an amount equivalent to 8 per cent, on expenditure on the improvement or structural alteration of a house (not being expenditure on decoration or repairs), and this provision has been extended in the new Rent Restrictions Act to include the provision of additional or improved fixtures or fittings.Moreover, the Building Societies have recently announced their willingness to lend money to their members for similar purposes.In our opinion these provisions should be sufficient and we make no recommendation in the matter.91. Freedom of owners from liability to certain further proceed-ings when their properties have been made in all respects fit for habitation Licensing of such properties. Suggestions were made to us by the representatives of the Property Owners that, when the properties have been reconditioned to the satisfaction of the Local Authority, owners should be free from further proceedings under the Housing Acts for a fixed period. One suggestion was that this period should be 25 years.Under section 17 of the Housing Act, 1930, a notice to an owner requiring the execution of works of repair, etc., must state that in the opinion of the authority those works will render the house fit for human habitation. It is the duty of the owner thereafter to keep the house fit for human habitation and we are not prepared to make any recommendation which would in any way reduce this obligation.92. We have considered, however, a somewhat similar but more limited proposal, which was contained in a memorandum submitted to us by Sir Austen Chamberlain and was supported by the National federation of Property Owners. It was suggested that a Local Authority should be empowered to grant to an owner of a house which had been repaired or reconditioned to the authority&apos;s satis-faction under Section 17 of the Housing Act, 1930, a licence exempting the owner for a fixed period from liability to a demolition-tion Order under Section 19 or clearance action under Section 1 of the Act, provided that he kept the house in all respects fit for habitation during the period of the licence. The local authority should also be empowered to extend the period.   We think that
this suggestion, which is designed to give the owner some security for his expenditure without relieving him of his obligation to main-tain his property in a good state, is one which should be accepted, and we recommend accordingly.We consider that the period of the original licence should not normally exceed ten years.93. Further powers for the closure of insanitary under-ground rooms or other parts of houses. Under the existing law a Local Authority has power to close for all purposes any part of a dwelling house which.is let separately and is unfit for human habitation in like circumstances to those in which they would make a demolition order on a whole house. The authority also have power to close, for sleeping purposes only, any underground room which is deemed to be unfit for human habitation by virtue of section 18 of the Hous-iaig Act, 1925. It will be seen that unfit parts of houses (including unfit underground rooms) cannot be closed for all purposes unless they are let separately.Power to close for all purposes unfit parts of houses situated in Improvement Areas and whether let separately or not has been obtained on behalf of the Borough Council of Kensington in the London County Council (General Powers) Act of this Session, and it was suggested to us by the Standing Joint Committee of Metro-politan Borough Councils that similar powers should be made generally available. The London County Council suggested that further consideration should be given to the matter when experience had been gained of the operation of the new power in KensingtonThe problem is most acute in, but is not confined to, London, where there are said to be about 30,000 insanitary basements, the inhabitants of which are mostly very poor people. The practical difficulty of the immediate application of more comprehensive powers of closure is the provision of the necessary rehousing accom-modation, especially in view of the difficulty of finding sites in the central areas. It is clear, therefore, that in view of the great exist-ing housing difficulties in London care would have to be taken in the administration of wider powers.We recommend, however, that the powers should be granted and we see no sufficient reason for limiting them to London or to Im-provement Areas. We recommend further that the new rehousing subsidy should be payable in respect of the new accommodation provided to rehouse the displaced persons.94. Back-to-back houses. Under the Act of 1930 subsidy is not available for rehousing persons displaced by the conversion of back-to-back houses.  The same difficulty may arise in the conversion of other houses of obsolete planning, and we recommend that the new 21012 c 3
subsidy should be available in aid of the rehousing of persons necessarily displaced where such houses are acquired and converted under our new proposals. We recommend further that the subsidy should be available where Local Authorities require or&apos; are able to induce private owners to convert such houses and displacements necessarily result.95. Obstructive Buildings. We recommend the restoration of the power which was contained in Section 19 of the Housing Act, 1925, to order the demolition of obstructive buildings. This section was repealed by the Act of 1930, and there is now no power to re-quire such buildings to be demolished except in Improvement Areas. Compensation should be payable on the basis of market value, pro-vided that the properties are in all respects fit for human habitation.PART IV. TYPES OF HEW HOUSES REQUIRED.96. The new housing with which Part II of this Report is con-cerned is rehousing accommodation for persons displaced from over-crowded houses acquired for reconditioning; and we realise that in practice the sizes and types of dwellings provided will approximate closely to the actual needs of the displaced persons. The same is broadly true of rehousing accommodation to be provided by Local Authorities in connection with slum schemes undertaken under the Act of 1930.97. In regard, however, to new housing at large to be provided by private enterprise, or by Local Authorities without subsidy, the question of the type of house to be provided seems to as to be one of considerable importance. Official emphasis has hitherto been laid on the three-bedroomed house as the type for which the primary need exists. The Census* figures show that 40-50 per cent, of all families in many of the large towns consist of only two or three persons, and in our opinion part of the overcrowding problem is caused by single persons and a number of small family groups who are unable to obtain alternative accommodation suitable to their needs and their purses. Moreover there is the further factor that many tenants wish to avoid the labour involved in looking after a house which is larger than they need. It has been represented to us that the capital saving effected by the provision of a smaller type of dwelling is normally not proportionate to the reduction in the accommodation provided, but we think that further considera-tion requires to be given to the technical aspects of the problem. Up to the present both public authorities and private enterpriseSome extracts from the Census Tables are appended (Appendix B).
have refrained from building the smaller type of dwelling to any considerable extent, and consequently there is insufficient material on which to form a final judgment in regard to relative costs. It should be possible by economical planning to devise a simpler and smaller type of accommodation on which a substantial saving in cost and so in rents could be secured.While for these reasons we think that a larger proportion of the small type of dwelling should be provided in future than hitherto, we desire to safeguard ourselves against misunderstanding in this matter. We are not suggesting that priority should not be given as at present to families with children, but we think that the small family units exist in sufficiently large numbers to justify special attention being given to their needs.98. To some extent the pressure might be eased by the provision without subsidy, by Local Authorities or Public Utility Societies, of lodging houses or hostels with single rooms for unmarried men or women.PART V.-RURAL HOUSING.99. It has long been recognised that the provision of satisfactory housing accommodation in rural districts presents special difficulties, and special financial assistance is available under the Housing (Rural Workers) Acts, 1926 and 1931 for the reconstruction and im-provement of rural cottages. The Committee on Local Bxpendi-ture recommended in their recent report that in the interests of true economy the more widespread operation of these Acts should be encouraged, and the Minister has adopted this view in the circular (No. 1335) which he has recently addressed to County and Rural District Councils.100. We received interesting evidence from the County Councils Association and the Rural District Councils Association as to the administration of these Acts and the reasons why, in the opinion of the Associations, more use was not made of the facilities which they afford. They emphasised the need for further propaganda to make these facilities more widely known, and they suggested that the Acts might be amended so as to enable rents to be based on a slightly higher rate of interest than the 3 per cent, which is at present allowed on the owners&apos; expenditure. We think that this is a reasonable suggestion, and we recommend that this rate should be raised to the same rate as that which is prescribed (at present 4 per cent.) for advances made to the owners by Authorities under the Acts. The consequential increase in rent would be very small but the psychological effect on the mind of the owner might be considerable.21012
101. It seems to us, however, that one of the principal reasons why the Acts are not more widely used is that the initiative of application rests with the private owner. However willing an authority may be to administer the Acts, it is often difficult to induce owners to make application for the assistance which the authorities are empowered to grant. We think that a large and rapid improvement in the position could be secured if the authorities administering the Acts were empowered and encouraged to acquire properties which are suitable for treatment under the Acts and recondition them themselves; and we recommend that compulsory powers of purchase on the refund basis of compensation should be conferred on the authorities.102. At the same time it has been represented to us that subsidy under the Acts is not at present payable in respect of properties which are owned by the authorities, and we recommend that the subsidy should be payable in these cases. At.present the authority makes a grant of two-thirds of the cost to the private owner and recovers half the grant&apos; from the State; in other words one-third of the cost is borne by the private owner, one-third by the authority and one-third by the State. Where the authorities become the owners, they should provide two-thirds of the cost themselves and be entitled to recover the balance of one-third from the State; it will be appreciated that as regards the one-third which they con-tribute as owners they will be entitled under our earlier recom-mendation to raise the rent by an amount equivalent to 4 per cent, on their expenditure (or whatever rate is for the time being prescribed).103. We are not aware of any Public Utility Societies who are at present operating in rural districts, but such Societies may well be brought into existence under our main proposals and we recom-mend that the new facilities which we have proposed for such Societies should be available in rural as in urban districts. Such Societies as owners would be entitled to&quot; claim the subsidy payable under the Housing (Rural Workers) Acts.104. An important difference between reconditioning in rural districts and similar work undertaken in urban districts is that in rural districts it is practicable and not uncommon to increase the existing accommodation by the addition of extra bedrooms as part of the work of reconditioning. Our recommendations, therefore, in regard to new building to abate overcrowding in the acquired houses in urban areas need not be extended to rural areas, where the same result can be achieved by an enlargement of the reconditioned house for which subsidy under the Housing (Rural Workers) Acts is available.
PART VI.-PROVISION OF NEW HOUSES (WITHOUT PUBLIC CHARGE) BY PUBLIC UTILITY OR OTHER SUCH SOCIETIES.105. Under paragraph (b) of our terms of reference we were instructed to consider and report what, if any, further steps were necessary or desirable to promote the supply of houses for the working classes, without public charge, through the agency of Public Utility or other such Societies operating in particular areas or otherwise.106. Our proposals under paragraph (a) of our terms of reference, under which a public charge was not precluded, will, if adopted, result in the provision of large numbers of new houses to abate overcrowding in the houses to be acquired for reconditioning. Accurate statistics are not available, but it is certain that a large proportion of the poorer workers for whom adequate provision has not already been made are living either in slums which will be dealt with under the Act of 1930 or in houses which can be acquired and decrowded under our proposals. It seems to us, therefore,, that the extent of the problem under paragraph (b) of our terms of reference, so far as the poorer workers are concerned, will be greatly reduced if our proposals under paragraph (a) are accepted. Some of us, however, are not satisfied on the evidence produced to us that there will be a sufficient supply of smaller houses for the poorer workers, with small families or with no family, to whom we have referred in Part IV. Although, for the reasons which we shall explain, we have been unable to recommend the adoption of certain proposals for a National Housing Board which were put before us, we think that the recommendations which we have made will go a long way towards securing some of the main objects which the advocates of a National Housing Board had in view. We have tried, however, so to frame our proposals as to avoid certain obvious dangers which were inherent in theirs.107. Comprehensive proposals for a National Housing Board, operating through independent local Public Utility Societies, were outlined to us by Sir Raymond Unwin and a group of persons associated with him. The financial basis of the proposals was a public loan, the principal and the greater part of the interest on which was to be guaranteed by the Government.108. The proposals assumed the inability of private enterprise to provide an adequate supply of new houses of good quality at rents within the means of the poorer workers ; and the position of Local Authorities in relation to the Public Utility Societies, and of the Ministry of Health in relation to the Housing Board, were not precisely defined. We have carefully considered this evidence and also examined a later and more detailed memorandum which was furnished at our request in regard to the financial details of the proposals.
109. We are precluded by our terms of reference from considering any proposals for the provision of new houses at large which would involve a public charge. It was contended, however, by Sir Eaymond Unwin that, although a Government guarantee would be needed in order to secure the capital on terms which &quot;would admit of sufficiently low rents, the finances of the Board could be so arranged as to safeguard the Exchequer against any call on the guarantee. This object was to be achieved partly by careful administration and partly by the creation of a margin or reserve to be obtained by charging rents on a basis of interest higher than that at which the capital was raised. It may be observed that the benefit of cheap money obtained on Government security would to this extent be reduced, and the rate of interest proposed for the calculation of the rents was no more favourable, and indeed probably less favourable, than that on which Local Authorities would find it necessary to base the rents of houses provided by themselves without subsidy. These, however, are minor points; the major considera-tion, as it seems to us, is that it is difficult both to claim that a Government guarantee is necessary and at the same time to contend that in no circumstances will any call be made upon it. If we may put it in another way, it is the very uncertainty of the income from small house property which is the reason for the comparatively high rate of interest on which the private investor bases rents, and the difference between this rate and the rate payable on gilt-edged securities may be regarded as the market estimate of the measure of that uncertainty ; the yield does not become more certain merely because a low expectation is announced beforehand. To base rents on a yield below market requirements and at the same time to claim that the ultimate yield will as a matter of certainty be equivalent to the yield on gilt-edged securities is merely to chal-lenge the market estimate of the security, and we should not feel justified in preferring the view of the promoters of the scheme to that of the investment market.110. We are, therefore, not convinced that the scheme put before us by Sir Baymond Unwin and his associates would not involve a public charge, and if only for this reason we should regard ourselves as precluded by our terms of reference from recommending its adoption.111. In view, however, of the public attention which has been given to these and similar proposals which have been placed before us by other witnesses, we think it desirable to indicate briefly the reasons why, on the information before us, we should feel unable to recommend their adoption, even if we were not pre-vented from so doing by the limitation in our terms of reference.In the first place, it would clearly be out of the question to extend to ordinary private enterprise trading for profit, similar facilities to those proposed for a national housing board, and, in the absence
of such facilities,,private enterprise, having just escaped from the subsidised competition of Local Authorites under the Act of 1924, would be exposed to a new form of subsidised competition by a large-scale public utility enterprise financed on long-term money and at gilt-edged rates. It was strongly represented to us by the National Association of Building Societies and the National Federations of Housebuilders and Property Owners that competition of this character would effectively prevent private builders and private investors from re-entering the field of working class housing.112. It was contended by some advocates of a national housing corporation that if the corporation were confined to providing houses at low rents for the poorer workers there was no reason why ordinary private enterprise should not provide houses to let at higher rents for the better paid workers. This contention, however, seems to us to be fallacious. The difference in the type of house provided would be negligible (indeed some of the advocates of the housing corporation contended that their houses would be better than houses provided by private enterprise), but the difference in rents would be considerable owing to the higher interest required by private enterprise, the shorter period of repayment, and the necessity for some margin of profit.113. It follows, therefore, in our view that we could not properly recommend the Government to finance a public utility organisation on the proposed lines until and unless we were satisfied that the time had. come when, in the words of the Committee on Local Ex-pen diture, &quot; the provision of housing accommodation for such of the working classes as are not in a position to buy their houses will have become finally and exclusively the function of public authorities &quot;. The Government&apos;s policy of encouraging private enterprise to return to this field is only a few months old, and we agree with the view of the Association of Municipal Corporations that it is premature at this stage to consider alternative plans for meeting a situation which could only arise if that policy should fail. We decline to play the part of undertakers at a premature burial.114. Moreover, if private enterprise should fail, we are not satisfied on the evidence which has been brought to us that the appropriate remedy would not be found in the provision of un-subsidised houses by the Local Authorities, whose skilled staffs and organisations are actually in being. We are not satisfied that a public utility organisation could build more cheaply than Local Authorities and, as we have already explained, there would be no substantial difference in the rate of interest on which rents would be based; indeed there would be a slight difference in favour of the Local Authorities.115. It was contemplated by Sir Raymond Unwin that the Local Authorities would be fully occupied with their programmes of slum clearance, but he was also insistent that slum clearance was only
a part of the housing problem which ought to be looked at and dealt with as a whole. We agree with this latter view, and we have already pointed out that questions of slum clearance are outside our terms of reference, and we should-therefore be unable to recommend the transfer of this work to Public Utility Societies even if we so desired. -116. It is true that Sir Eaymond Unwin proposed that those Local Authorities who desired to continue their operations should be allowed to do so, but he seemed to contemplate the ultimate though gradual supersession of Local Authorities by the public utility organisation; other advocates of a National Housing Cor-poration on the other hand seemed to contemplate the almost immediate supersession of Local Authorities.   Whether the super-session proposed is immediate or gradual, an issue of the first im-portance to local government is raised, on which the time for a final decision has not yet arrived.   If the private enterprise policy of the Government were to fail and the housing of the working classes were to become generally recognised as exclusively a social service, the question of principle would clearly require to be settled, whether the service  should be administered by  elected Local Authorities under the  supervision and  general control  of the Ministry of Health (which has a large administrative, financial and technical staff wholly engaged on this work), or whether the service is one which could more suitably be administered by a new central and local public utility organisation responsible to Parliament, through the Minister, on major issues of policy only.   In this con-nection it will be borne in mind that housing is essentially a local question and is closely connected with the allied services of water-supply, sewerage and roads, the responsibility for which must cer-tainly remain with the Local Authorities under the general super-vision of the Ministry of Health.117. While we think that it would be premature to pronounce a. final opinion on this issue, we have no hesitation in recording our opinion that no sufficiently strong case has been made to us for the creation at this juncture of a new organisation, the establish-ment of which would finally drive private enterprise from the field and would also in our view deter some Local Authorities from the urgent task of slum clearance. Moreover, the transition from the old to the new regime would necessarily take a considerable time during which little or nothing would be done either by the old or the new agencies.118. In coming to this conclusion we have not overlooked the criticisms which are levelled at local housing administration and some of which have been brought to us in evidence. It seems to us, however, that they should be considered in relation to the magnitude of municipal housing operations since the War and, unless the evils of the system are more widespread than we have reason to suppose, they do not seem to us to constitute a sufficient
reason for the replacement of Local Authorities at this stage by a completely new organisation. More cogent evidence than has been presented to us would in our opinion be required before Parliament should decide to discard the accumulated experience of fourteen years of municipal housing in order to experiment with a new and untried organisation.119. We have dealt at some length with Sir Raymond TJnwin&apos;s proposals, as the general principles involved in their consideration arise also on other proposals put forward by other witnesses.Lord Eustace Percy made proposals somewhat similar to those made by Sir Raymond Unwin except that he contemplated : &apos;(a) that the central organisation should normally work through local agencies and not through independent local Public Utility Societies; and(b) that the houses to be provided by those agencies should contain a proportion of larger houses on the principle of a &quot;mixed bag&quot;, in order that the financial risks might be spread over different categories of property.He did not in terms suggest a Government guarantee but he indicated no other means by which the necessary finance could be raised over a sufficiently long period at sufficiently low rates of interest.120. More ambitious proposals for a National Housing Corpora-lion were put before us by Mr. rees. and Mr. Nicholson, who advocated the formation under Government auspices of a cen-tralised. organisation for the building of houses, which should be vested when built in the local authorities or in subsidiary house holding companies. These proposals also assumed the inability of private enterprise to provide houses at sufficiently low rents for the poorer workers. Various schemes for financing the proposals were put forward, but all were dependent in varying degrees on a Government guarantee.121. Mr. Rees and Mr. Nicholson represented to us the advant-ages which, in their view, would accrue from the bulk purchase of materials (a point which was also stressed by Sir Raymond Unwin), and from planning and building on a national scale. We are not satisfied, however, that the provision of houses for the working classes is a service which lends itself readily to the large scale methods of a highly centralised organisation of this character. Bulk supply postulates bulk demand, whereas the demand for houses and the types of houses required both depend on local conditions and local circumstances which vary greatly.We think, indeed, that private enterprise and some of the larger Local Authorities may find it desirable and, on a long view, economical to undertake schemes on a larger scale than has been usual hitherto. There is nothing to prevent such authorities as, for example, the London County Council or the Councils of such
great cities as Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester from under-taking projects on the largest scale. We think that they should be encouraged to do so, but we do not think that they would be either encouraged or assisted by the establishment of a centralised building organisation. , &apos;    .122. In theory no doubt there is much to be said in support of the view that bulk purchase may result in large economies; on the other hand, it may well be urged that, while conditions to-day are different from those prevailing immediately after the War, actual experience of large scale purchase by public authorities suggests that the effect may be, not to reduce, but to increase prices. We understand that (apart from a shortage of bricks, which we are assured is only temporary) the supply of building materials is at present fully adequate to the demand, and it seems to us that the introduction into such a market of a large-scale purchaser sup-ported by Government finance would probably have the very opposite effect from that intended.123. If prices of materials were to be unduly raised, the appro-priate remedy would be an application to the Import Duties Advisory Committee under the Import Duties Act, 1932. There is, more-over, in permanent session an Inter-Departmental Committee, whose duty it is to review the prices of building materials and to make reports from time to time to the Minister of Health and the President of the Board of Trade. This machinery should afford a simple and ready means of ascertaining the facts, on which any such application to the Import Duties Advisory Committee could be founded.124. Moreover, whatever may be said in theory for or against proposals of this character, it will be generally agreed that the . result in practice would depend largely on the skill and experience of those who were in charge of the central organisation. Neither Mr. Rees nor Mr. Nicholson in the evidence which they gave to us claimed to have any wide practical experience of the administrative problems involved in the provision of houses for the working classes in this country.125. For these reasons we should be unable to recommend the adoption of any of the proposals which were put before us by the various witnesses for a National Housing Board or Corporation, even if we were not satisfied that the proposals fell outside our terms of reference. We have, however, incorporated a number of Sir Raymond Unwin&apos;s suggestions in the constructive proposals which we have made under paragraph (a) of our terms of reference.We think that the type of organisation which he advocated is well suited to the administration of our proposals, which include the management of large numbers of reconditioned houses. If,I moreover, our proposals are adopted, they will afford a useful! opportunity of measuring the potentialities of this type of organi-l sation, operating within a limited field and properly co-ordinatedl with existing agencies.
101PART VII. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.126. At the end of the Report will be found a list of our recommendations. It may be useful if we summarise shortly our principal conclusions and the grounds on which they are based.We have carefully refrained; for the reasons which we have given, from making any recommendations which would impede the slum clearance programmes of Local Authorities or the return of private builders and investors to the provision of working class houses. We have, therefore, felt unable to recommend the adoption of the proposals, put before us by several witnesses, for the forma-tion of a National Housing Corporation to undertake on a national scale, whether through subsidiary building companies or through independent local Public Utility Societies, the future provision of houses for the poorer members of the working classes. All these proposals involved or implied a Government guarantee, and, there-fore, fell strictly outside our terms of reference. Apart, however, from this consideration, we are satisfied that any such proposals are at this stage premature and would, if adopted, have a deterrent effect on both private and municipal enterprise.Questions of slum clearance are outside our terms of reference, but, in considering and formulating proposals in regard to that part of the housing problem with which we are concerned, we have tried not to lose sight of the whole. We agree with the view that the first essential task is to clear the slums; we have made no proposals which would afford Local Authorities any excuse to slacken or reduce their efforts in this direction : and we have made it clear that we are definitely opposed to the policy of reconditioning a cheap alternative to demolition and replacement. Apart, how-ever, from the dwellers in the so-called slums, which are to be demolished, large numbers of the poorer classes are to-day living in conditions which ought not to be tolerated. They are living in decaying houses which are badly managed, inadequately repaired and often grossly overcrowded, and it is to methods for helping these people that we have primarily turned our attention. Large tracts of this property are to be found, especially in the larger centres of population, and call urgently for treatment on new and bolder lines. We think that there is here a gap in the Govern-menfs housing policy, and our proposals are intended to fill it.It is abundantly clear that the existing law is adequate, if en-Iforced, to compel landlords of working class properties to keep them Tin all respects fit for human habitation. In some districts the law is adequately enforced but in many it is not. The principal reasons lor this failure in administration are local apathy, the influence of property owners on some Local Authorities, the shortage of local ftaffs, the existence of a number of poor owners whom some Local Authorities are reluctant to press, the hampering effects on manage-aent of the Rent Restrictions Acts, and the economic effect of the
housing shortage in enabling landlords to curtail their expenditure on repairs without endangering their rents.Whatever be the causes, the discreditable result remains. Corn-missions and Committees have inquired and reported and the law has been from time to time amended and strengthened, but its ad-ministration remains defective. But even if the law were to be fully enforced, the remedy would, in our opinion, in many cases come too late. There has grown up in too many districts a bad tradition between landlord and tenant of this class of property. . That tradition can, we think, only be cured by improved&apos; and enlightened management and we see no practical way of securing this on a sufficiently large scale except by the. acquisition of the properties. That management lies at the root of the problem is no new doctrine; it was preached and practised some 70 years ago by Octavia Hill, and the essential soundness of her views has been proved by the successful practice of her methods .by an increasing number of public authorities, private persons and Public Utility Societies.We propose an extension on a large scale of the work of these Societies. We have recommended the appointment of a strong Central Public Utility Council to. promote and supervise the Societies and to advise and make recommendations to the Minister in regard to proposals for the acquisition, reconditioning and management of workng class properties which are not kept by their owners in all respects fit for human habitation.We propose that every owner of working class property which is not in all respects fit for human habitation shall be made liable at law to expropriation on a new basis of compensation. At the same time we desire to give every encouragement to those owners who axe willing and able themselves to put their houses in order, and with this object we have made two important recommenda-tions. We propose that private owners should be given the statu-tory right to submit to the Minister voluntary clearance or improve-ment schemes (except in regard to properties included in the five year clearance programmes of the Local Authorities); and we pro-pose also that Local Authorities should be empowered to give a licence to any owner who has reconditioned his house to their satis-faction, exempting the house for a fixed period from liability to clearance or demolition without full compensation. It will be appreciated, however, that his obligation to maintain the property in a good state during the licensed period will remain undiminished. It will be open to any owner to claim exemption from expropriation on the proposed new basis of compensation if he shows that the property has been made in all respects fit by the material date, which will be the date of inspection, or that the property is included in a voluntary clearance or improvement scheme which he has already submitted to the Minister.The proposed new basis of compensation is not confiscatory. Tt is more fully explained in paragraphs 25-31 of the Beport, but,
as it is both novel in character and vital to the rapid and simple execution of our proposals, it may be desirable to summarise briefly its nature and the considerations which have led us to adopt it.We propose that the dispossessed owners should be paid what they themselves paid for the property, or the value accepted for death duties if they inherited it, or the value adopted for stamp duty if they acquired it,by deed of gift. That is to say, the con-sideratiori disclosed on the latest transaction prior to the date of our Report should be taken as the compensation to be paid. In other vyords we should give them back their money.Our objects in recommending this new procedure are to avoid the expense, delay and uncertainty of arbitration and to secure, so far as possible, some payment to all interests. The only alternative basis which we might feel justified in recommending would be the basis of market value after allowing for the cost of putting the property in good repair and discounting any excess rents obtained from illegal use or overcrowding. On that basis many interests such as the lessees for a short term would receive little or nothing, many mortgagees would suffer serious loss, and hardship might be in-dieted on a number of poor people. In addition there would be the delay and uncertainty of arbitration proceedings and relatively heavy administrative expenses. Further, it might Be necessary to appoint a large temporary central staff to carry through the negotia-tions. Local Authorities would be reluctant to face the large amount of work involved on behalf of Public Utility Societies, and the latter have neither the staff nor experience necessary for this kind of work.We appreciate that the plan could not unfairly be described as rough justice and we realise that anomalies will arise as between different owners, but we are satisfied that as between the owners and the community the plan would be fair and reasonable and would err, if at all, on the side of generosity to the owners. We are advised, however, that on balance the interests of the com-munity would be adequately protected on this basis.We propose that the compulsory powers of purchase should be conferred on the Local Authorities but, in view of the expressed reluctance of the urban authorities to hold and manage inferior property, we contemplate that in many districts the powers will be exercised on the initiative of and on behalf of approved Public Utility Societies, which are at present in existence or will be brought into existence to meet the need for their services. Such Societies should work in close co-operation with the Local Authori-ties, who will be asked to exercise the compulsory powers on their behalf; and, if the Local Authority should decline to act, it is proposed to empower the Minister to confer on the Society the compulsory powers of the authority. Where no suitable approved Society exists or can readily be formed, the properties should be vested in House Management Commissioners appointed by the Local Authority.   Where neither of these alternatives is
practicable, the Local Authority should be empowered to repair, hold and manage the properties themselves.We think that in rural districts the facilities provided by the Housing (Rural Workers) Acts should be made more widely known, and that the Authorities administering the Acts should be stimulated to greater activity. It seems to us, however, that so long as the initiative of application rests with the private owner no large or rapid improvement in the position cam be expected. However-willing an Authority may be to grant the facilities it is difficult to induce many owners to make application. We have, therefore, recommended that the Authorities should be empowered to acquire, on the refund basis of compensation, properties which are suitable for treatment under the Acts, recondition them themselves, and draw the State subsidy which is at present payable under the Acts.We recognise that it may be that some Authorities may still fail to administer actively the new powers, but in any such district it will under our proposals be open to any group of persons, who are concerned to bring about an improvement, to form them-selves into a Public Utility Society and apply to the Minister for the facilities which we have recommended for such Societies. If in any such district there is not even a small number of such per-sons, it is unlikely that any large improvement will be secured under any system. The Minister&apos;s default powers will, however, remain and should in suitable cases be exercised.We have devised a financial scheme on a careful basis which will, we think, without serious risk to the Government ensure adequate capital facilities to the Public Utility Societies, who, however, will be encouraged and to some extent required to find a proportion of the necessary funds themselves. We propose that a rehousing grant should be available in urban areas to enable Public Utility Societies or Local Authorities to undertake new building to abate overcrowding in the acquired houses. In rural areas the overcrowding in the acquired houses should normally be dealt with by the addition of rooms as part of the work of recondi-tioning.Such is the plan in bare outline. We appreciate that if adopted it will be far reaching in its effects. The ownership of property involves duties as well as rights. Against that large body of owners who realise their obligations our proposals are not directed. But we aim at the elimination of all owners who have proved themselves unwilling or unable to discharge the obligations of ownership, and who have continually evaded both the spirit and the letter of the law.   .If our plan is not thought acceptable, the only alternative which we can see is that the Central Government should bring further pressure to bear on Local Authorities to enforce their powers and should if need be withhold the payment of part of their existing housing subsidies.   This course however would leave untouched the

C. H. Salmon, who took Mr. Hearder&apos;s place as Secre-tary, and also of Mr. A. B. Carpenter, who was attached to the Committee to assist on financial questions. Mr. Salmon&apos;s task has been of a very exacting nature. In addition to his very efficient arrangements for the evidence, his grasp of the subject has proved throughout most useful to the Committee. He and Mr. Carpenter have shown the highest ability in the preparation of our Report, and we wish to put on record, our indebtedness to both of them for their invaluable help throughout the inquiry.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Signed)   Moyne (Chairman).Francis D.

We think it unlikely that any large imme-diate improvement could be effected on these lines and the problem would be left to find its natural solution in the efflux of time, when after Some decades the houses became ripe for demolition.But if, as we believe, the public conscience is ahve to the necessity of drastic action and is prepared to support it, we think that our proposals will provide a just, quick and practicable means of securing a comprehensive improvement in the health and hous-ing conditions of the working classes.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.General Scheme of the Proposals.1. Local Authorities should be given compulsory powers and encouraged to acquire, for reconditioning, working-class houses which are not in all respects fit for human habitation but can be made fit and to which a probable life of at least twenty years can be given.   (Paras. 34, 38, 42.)2. Where an approved Public Utility Society exists or can readily be formed, the houses should normally be acquired on behalf of the Society who will repair, improve and manage thern. (Paras. 38, 42.)3. In the absence of such a Society, the Local Authorities should be empowered to lease the houses to House Management Com-missioners, who would be appointed by and ultimately responsible to the Local Authority, but should be given full discretion and independence in regard to the details of administration. (Paras. 41-42.)The Commissioners should be empowered to co-opt persons ex-ineperienced in house management and social welfare.  (Para. 41.)4. Where neither of the alternatives referred to in 2 and 3 above is practicable, the Local Authority should be empowered to hold, repair and manage the houses themselves.  (Para. 42.)5. Management should be based on the Octavia Hill system and wherever practicable women housing estate managers should be employed.   (Paras. 23, 42.)6. In suitable cases the Local Authority or the approved Public Utility Society should be authorised to demolish the acquired houses with a view to obtaining a rehousing site (para. 54), or to acquire them with this original intention.   (Para. 35.)7. Power should be given to the acquiring authorities to acquire in suitable cases fit properties for the purpose of securing a con-venient area for management or to facilitate ultimate redevelopment. Such properties should be acquired on the basis of market value as modified by Part II of the Third Schedule to the Housing Act, 1930.   (Para. 51.)8. Approved Public Utility Societies should be given such powers of entry as will enable them to exercise effectively the powers which we propose for them.   (Para. 42.)
Central Public Utility Council.9. A strong Central Public Utility Council should be appointed by the Minister of Health. The Council should consist of not more than five persons, including the Chairman. They should be paid on a part-time basis, and should include at least one member with special financial qualifications. The staff should be appointed by the Minister. -The post of Chairman should be filled if possible by some eminent person of standing and experience both of municipal and voluntary housing activities.The principal functions of the Central Council are set out in paragraph 80 of the Bsycrt.The Council might usefully consider the promotion of a non-statu-tory Housing Association or league for propaganda and as a common meeting ground for municipal and voluntary workers interested in housing. The Minister should be authorised to make a small grant for this purpose.   (Paras. 79-81.)Approval of Public Utility Societies.10. Approved Public Utility Societies should work in close co-operation with the Local Authorities. Before recommending such Societies for the Ministers approval, the Central Public Utility Council should normally be satisfied that the Committee of Management includes either members of the Local Authority or other persons experienced in local government; in some cases a representative of any local Building Society should be invited to become a member of the Committee of Management. The Central Council should be satisfied that the managing personnel is such-that the Society can be relied on to carry out with businesslike efficiency the public service to be entrusted to them. (Paras. 40, 75, 79, 80.)Basis of Compensation.11. The basis of compensation payable to the expropriated owners or lessees should be the &quot; refund &quot; basis, i.e., the price to be paid by the acquiring authority should be (a) the purchase price paid by the owner, or(b) if the owner inherited the premises, its principal value accepted for death duties when they passed to him, or(c) if the owner acquired the houses by deed of gift, the value adopted for stamp duty puposes,(d) in the case of leasehold interests the payment should be such an apportioned part of the purchase price, or the principal value accepted for death duties, or the value adopted for stamp
&apos; duty purposes, as the number of years of the lease unexpired at the date of acquisition by the acquiring authority bears to the number of years unexpired at the date of acquisition by the lessee.In cases where the latest transaction in respect of a property to be acquired includes other properties not to be acquired, the appor-tionment should, failing agreement, be referred to one of the official arbitrators.In all the foregoing cases the amount should be determined by reference to the latest transaction prior to the date of this Report.The relatively few cases to which the refund basis would not be applicable should be settled on the basis laid down in Part II of the Third Schedule to the Housing Act, 1930. (Paragraphs 25-31 and 126.)(The advantages and possible objections to the refund basis of compensation are fully discussed in paragraphs 28-31 of the Report.)12. It is suggested for consideration that the new basis of com-pensation should be made applicable to any working-class houses which are not in all respects fit for human habitation and are to be acquired by any public authority (as denned in section 12 (2) of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919), for any statutory purpose, subject to the usual departmental consents. This suggestion does not extend to demolishable houses for which the site value basis of compensation is prescribed by the Housing Acts.   (Para. 37.)Procedure.13. Approved Public Utility Societies should submit their proposals in a preliminary form for the general approval of the Central Public Utility Council.   (Para. 42.)14. Having obtained this general approval, the Society should ask the Local Authority to serve notices on the owners.  (Para. 42.)15. Where resort to compulsory powers is necessary, the Society should ask the Local Authority to acquire the houses on their behalf, and should be empowered to submit an official representation to the Local Authority, a copy of which should be sent to the Central Council.   (Para. 42.)16. If the Local Authority should decline or unduly delay to accede to the Society&apos;s request or act on the representation, the Society should have a right of appeal to the Minister, who should be empowered to invest the Society with the compulsory powers of the Local Authority.   (Para. 42.)
105Safeguards for owners.18. The following safeguards for the owners and lessees are recommended: (a) An owner or lessee, who produces to the Inspector a certificate from the Local Authority, issued since the serving of the notice, that the house is now fit for habitation, or satisfies the Inspector that the house is so fit, should be exempt from expropriation on the proposed new basis.   (Paras. 47, 49.)17. The procedure for notifying owners and hearing appeals on fact should be simple and expeditious.The acquiring authority should serve a notice on owners and lessees of the houses to be bought requiring them to forward withinfixed period a statutory declaration as to the price paid for the houses, or the value accepted for death duties or for stamp duty if the houses were inherited or acquired by gift, and explaining the basis of compensation and the right of appeal on fact to the Minister of Health.   (Para. 43.)Each property should be judged on its own merits. It will nor-mally be convenient to submit proposals for dealing with areas or aggregations of property, but acquiring authorities should not be required by law to define an area.   (Para. 44).The right of appeal of the owner or lessee should be confined to an appeal on fact, i.e., on the ground that he claims that his property is or will at the time of the inspection have been made in all respects fit for human habitation. He should be entitled to submit written objection on this ground to the Minister, who should order the property to be inspected and decide whether or not it should be exempted.   (Para. 45.)Due notice of the Inspectors visit should be given to the objecting owners and lessees, who should be entitled to be present at the inspection and put their case to the Inspector. The Inspectors Report should be made to the Minister, whose decision should be communicated to the objectors and should be final. (Para. 45.)The Minister should exclude any property, which is too bad for anything except demolition, or the price of which is excessive having regard to its probable useful life, the cost of repairs, and the loss of income resulting from the abatement of overcrowding. In either case the Local Authority&apos;s attention should be especially directed to it with a view to action under the Housing Act, 1930.  (Para. 48.)It is a matter for consideration whether this simplified procedure should not be applied, with the necessary modifications, to houses or aggregations of houses which are to be demolished or cleared under the Housing Act, 1930.  (Para. 46.)
(b) Owners should be given the right (subject to certain provisos) to submit to the Minister voluntary clearance or im-provement schemes, and any property included in such a scheme which had been submitted to the Minister before the date of the Inspectors visit should be exempt from liability to acqui-sition on the new basis. (See recommendation 27 below.) (Paras. 49, 86.)(c) An owner or lessee should be entitled to demand from the Local Authority a list of the works needed to make the house in all respects fit for human habitation and a statement that, if the works are carried out before the date of inspection, the certificate referred to above will be granted.   (Para. 49.)(d) Where any owner has reconditioned a house to the satisfaction of the Local Authority under section 17 of the Housing Act, 1930, the Local Authority should be empowered to grant him a licence exempting him for a fixed period from liability to a Demolition Order under Section 19 of the Act of 1930 or clearance action under Section 1 of the Act, provided that he keeps the house in all respects fit during the period of the licence. The licence should not exceed a period of ten years, but the Local Authority should have power to extend it. (Para. 92.)Rehousing accommodation.19. In urban areas rehousing accommodation should be pro-vided to abate overcrowding in the acquired houses, and, where rehousing is to be provided by an approved Public Utility Society, the site should be acquired on their behalf by the Local Authority. In the case of refusal or undue delay on the part of the Local Authority, compulsory powers should J be made exerciseable by the Society as recommended above in regard to properties to be acquired for reconditioning.   (Paras. 52-54.)Proposed rehousing subsidy.20. Exchequer grant should be available in urban areas in aid j of the rehousing accommodation provided to abate overcrowding in I the acquired houses.   (Para. 52.)Where such rehousing is provided by an approved Public Utility [Society in tenements of more than three storeys on expensive sites j(as denned in section 26 of the Housing Act, 1930), the subsidy I should be  12 per tenement for 60 years.   (Para. 57.)Where the rehousing is provided by such a Society in any other I new accommodation, the subsidy should be  5 per house for 60 years. j (Para. 57.)
In each case the subsidies should be subject to revision in the circumstances contemplated in paragraph 61 of the Report.Where the rehousing is provided by a Local Authority, the autho-rity should be required to make a contribution from the rates and the Exchequer subsidy should be correspondingly reduced. A smaller rate contribution than that payable under the Act of 1930 may be considered appropriate, but no recommendation is made as to the amount of the contribution, which is a matter to be settled by the Minister after consultation with the Local Authorities.   (Para 60.)Condition of subsidy.21. The principal condition on which these subsidies should be payable should be that the rents to be charged should not exceed on the average 2s. 9d. (exclusive of rates) per habitable room in tenements of more than three storeys on expensive sites, and Is. 6d. (exclusive of rates) per habitable room in any other new accommodation.   (Paras. 55-36.)These rent conditions would mean an average rent of 8s. 3d. per week (exclusive of rates) for a normal three-roomed tenement and of 6s. per week (exclusive of rates) for a normal three-bedroomed house.   (Para. 57.)The subsidies recommended above are related to these rents as explained in paragraph 57 of the Report.Loan facilities for approved Public Utility Societies.22. The Central Financing Authority should be empowered to ad-vance to approved Public Utility Societies the sums required to enable the Societies to acquire and recondition the acquired pro-perties, provided that the loan charges on the amount advanced should not exceed the estimated rental income of the properties after overcrowding has been abated and an adequate allowance has been made for repairs, maintenance, etc.   (Paras. 66-67.)The Table contained in paragraph 67 of the Report shows the maximum permissible advances under the proposals on certain assumptions.Expenditure on any more extensive repairs or improvements than can be made out of an advance so limited will fall to be met from the Societies&apos; own funds.   (Para. 68.)In some cases the Societies may be able to obtain financial assist-ance from the Local Authorities.   (Para. 68.)The Central Financing Authority should be empowered to make advances to approved Public Utility Societies for the provision of new accommodation to rehouse persons displaced to abate over-crowding in the acquired houses. The power to make advances should extend up to 100 per cent, of the estimated value of the
properties, but advances should normally be limited to an amount not exceeding 90 per cent., the balance of 10 per cent, being obtained from the issue of shares bearing interest not exceeding 5 per cent. (Attention is drawn to the calculations in paragraph 69 of the Report.)   (Para. 69.)Central Financing Authority.23. The functions of the Central Financing Authority should be discharged by the Minister of Health, at least until the scope of the operations can be measured.It is contemplated that the Minister will obtain the necessary funds from the National Debt Commissioners, and should be guided in his administration of them by the advice and recommendations of the Central Public Utility Council. It is a matter for the Govern-ment to consider whether a special housing loan should be issued. (Paras. 70, 71.)Margin for administrative expenses.24. The interest charged on advances should include a percentage for management expenses, so that the administration of the scheme may ultimately become self-supporting.   (Para. 77.)Common Reserve Fund.25. In order to minimise the risk of loss to the Exchequer a common reserve fund should be set up and administered by the Central Financing Authority.The Minister should be empowered, on the advice and recommen-dation of the Central Council, to determine how much of any surplus revenue of an approved Public Utility Society should be allocated to its own reserve fund, and how much should be payable into the common reserve fund. Before advising the Minister, the Central Council should confer with the Society, and regard should be had to the measure of assistance accorded to each Society in deciding how much of its surplus revenue may be retained in its own reserve fund.Separate accounts should be kept of undertakings or parts of undertakings which are financed under our proposals, and the Societies should be required to submit their accounts to such audit as the Minister may determine.   (Para. 78.)Rural Housing.26. Greater use should be made of the facilities provided by the Housing (Rural Workers) Acts, 1926 and 1931.in
The Acts should be amended so as to enable the permitted increase of rent to be based on the same rate of interest as that which is prescribed (at present 4 per cent.) for advances made to the owners by Authorities under the Acts. The Authorities administering the Acts should be empowered to acquire on the refund basis of com-pensation&apos; properties which are suitable for treatment under the Acts, recondition them themselves, and draw the State subsidy which is at present payable under the Acts. Overcrowding in the acquired houses in rural areas should normally be abated by an addition of rooms as part of the work of reconditioning. The recom-mendations, therefore, in regard to new building to abate over-crowding in the acquired houses in urban areas are not extended to rural areas.   (Paras. 99-104.)Voluntary schemes by private owners and Public Utility Societies.27. Private owners of property, including Public Utility Societies, should be given the statutory right to submit voluntary clearance or improvement schemes direct to the Minister, provided that such schemes are limited (a) to schemes agreed with all owners and lessees, and (b) to properties not included in clearance areas under the Local Authorities&apos; five-year programmes. The Minister, before approving the schemes, should obtain the views of the Local Authority and arrange for an inspection of the properties.The Minister should be empowered to pay subsidy (on the reduced basis recommended above) in aid of rehousing accommodation pro-vided by Local Authorities or Public Utility Soceties for persons displaced from properties required under the scheme to be de-molished or to abate overcrowding in houses to be reconditioned, provided that the special conditions as to rents, etc., are observed.The new loan facilities recommended for approved Public Utility Societies should extend to rehousing schemes of this character carried out by such Societies.  (Paras. 85-88.)Further powers for closure of insanitary basements or other partsof houses.28. Local authorities should be empowered to close for all purposes of human habitation unfit parts of houses (including unfit basements) whether let separately or not; and the Minister should be empowered to pay subsidy (on the reduced basis recom-mended above) in respect of the new accommodation provided to rehouse the displaced persons.   (Para. 93.)Back-to-back houses.29. The Minister should be empowered to pay subsidy (on the reduced basis recommended above) in aid of the rehousing of persons necessarily displaced from back-to-back
houses or other houses of obsolete planning which are acquired and converted under our proposals. The Minister should also be em-powered to pay the subsidy where Local Authorities require or are able to induce private owners to convert such houses, and displace-ments necessarily result.   (Para 94.)Obstructive buildings.30. The power which was contained in Section 19 of the Housing Act, 1925, and was repealed by the Act of 1930, to deal with obstructive buildings should be restored. Com-pensation should be payable on the basis of market value provided that the properties are in all respects fit for human habitation. (Para. 95.)Types of dwelling. 31. Private enterprise and Local Authorities in providing new houses at large should be encouraged to provide in future a larger proportion of small dwellings for the small family groups who, according to the latest census figures, constitute nearly 50 per cent, of all families in many of the large towns.Local authorities and Public Utility Societies should also be en-couraged to provide without subsidy lodging-houses or hostels with single rooms for unmarried men or women.   (Paras. 96-98.)Provision of new houses (without public charge) by Public Utility or other such Societies.32. The Committee reject the various proposals for a National Housing Board or Corporation in the form or on the scale in which they were put before them. Their reasons are given in paragraphs 105-125 of the Report.
APPENDIX A.summary of principal phovisions foe securing the repair by owners oedefective houses.. 1. Sousing Act, 1925.(i) Under Sections 1 and 2 it is an implied condition in any contract for letting for habitation a dwelling house at a rent not exceeding certain limits laid down in Section 1, and in any contract of employment of a workman employed in agriculture part of whose remuneration consists of the provision for him.of dwelling accommodation, that the house or dwelling accommoda-tion is at the commencement of occupation, and will he kept by the landlord during occupation, in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation.(ii) Under Sections 6 and 7 local authorities are expressly empowered, in regard to houses which are let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family and are intended or used for occupation by the working classes, to include among byelaws made and enforceable by them, byelaws, inter alia :  for enforcing drainage and promoting cleanliness and ventilation of such houses;for the keeping in repair and adequate lighting of any common staircase in such houses;for the cleansing and redecoration of the premises at stated times and for the paving of the courts and courtyards;for imposing on the owner the duty of executing any work required for the above-mentioned and other purposes;and, under Section 7, if the owner fails to execute any of the required works, the local authority may carry them out and recover the costs and expenses from him.(iii) Under Section 8 it is the duty of every local authority to cause an inspection of their district to be made from time to time with a view to ascertaining whether any dwelling house therein is unfit for human habitation-tion, and to keep such records as the Minister may prescribe.The Regulations* made under this Section require the inspection to be a thorough one and also provide that the Medical Officer of Health or other officer acting under his direction shall cause a list to be prepared of houses which require early inspection.The results of inspections made are required to be carefully recorded, and the Regulations also require a local authority &quot; as far as may be necessary &quot; to take the records into consideration at each of their ordinary meetings and thereafter to give all such directions as may be necessary or desirable in respect of the houses affected.(iv) Under Section 30 the Courts are authorised to make an order em-powering the superior landlord to enter and execute necessary works where working class houses on land in which he has any interest are proved, to the satisfaction of the Courts, to be or to be likely to become dangerous or injurious to health or unfit for human habitation.2. Housing Act, 1930. (a) Definition of unfitness for human habitation. Section 62 of the Act provides that in determining whether a house is fit for human habitation regard is to be had to the extent, if any, to which by reason of disrepair or sanitary defects, it falls short of the standard required by local byelaws or of the general standard of housing accommodation for* Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925, as amended by Housing Con-solidated Amendment Regulations, 1932.
the working classes in the district. The expression &quot; sanitary defects &quot; is denned as including lack of air space or of ventilation, darkness, dampness, absence of adequate and readily accessible iwater supply or sanitary accom-modation or of other conveniences and inadequate paving or drainage of courts, yards or passages. ^        -   &apos;(b) Individual houses. A local authority on receiving a report that a house is in any respect unfit for human habitation must first decide whether or not the house can he made fit at a reasonable expense. If it can, the duty of the Local Authority under Section 17 is to serve a notice upon the person having the control of the house requiring that person to carry out within a reasonable time, not being less than twenty-one days, the work necessary to make the house fit for occu-pation, such work to be specified in the notice. In the owher&apos;s default the Authority is empowered to do the work for him and to recover the cost. (Section 18.)If it is considered that the house cannot be made fit for human habitation at a reasonable expense the duty of the Authority is to secure its demolition. But before the Authority proceed to make a demolition order the owner has to be given the opportunity of submitting for the Authority&apos;s consideration any offer with respect to the carrying out of works, or the future user of the house and the Authority may accept from him an undertaking either to carry out, within a specified period, such works as will in the Authority&apos;^ opinion render the dwelling fit for habitation or that it shall not be used for human habitation until the Authority, on being satisfied that it has been rendered fit for the purpose, cancel the undertaking.   (Section 19.)Appeals against the decision of the local authority are made to the County Court.&quot;Where the Authority have acted, on the view that a house is repairable at a reasonable expense, but that view is not accepted by the Court, the Authority are empowered to acquire the house by agreement or compulsorily. In the latter case the Authority are under obligation to carry out the work which they themselves considered to be not unduly costly.   (Section 23.)TJnder Section 20 a local authority is empowered to secure the closing for human habitation of any part of a building which is unfit and is let separately and to prevent the use for sleeping purposes of any underground room (which is unfit within the meaning of Section 18 of the Act of 1925.In order to avoid the infliction of undue hardship on owners the local authority are empowered where they carry out works in the owner&apos;s default to arrange for the cost to be repaid by weekly or other instalments over a period not exceeding 30 years (Section 18 (5) ) or the Authority may make advances to owners to enable them to carry out necessary works. (Sec-tion 47.)Where a dwelling is demolished no compensation is payable, and, where a dwelling is acquired compulsorily, under Section 23, only cleared site value is payable. But the local authority is given discretionary power in Section 41 to make an allowance towards removal expenses or loss of business.(c) Improvement Areas (Sections 7-12 of the Housing Act, 1930. Section 7 (1) provides as follows:  Where a local authority, upon consideration of an official representa-tion or other information in their possession, are satisfied as respects any area in their district that the housing conditions in that area are dangerous or injurious to the health of the inhabitants by reason of the disrepair or sanitary defects of dwelling houses therein, and also by reason either of overcrowding in the area or of the bad arrangement of the houses or of the narrowness or bad arrangement of the streets, and that those conditions can be effectively remedied, without the demolition of all the buildings in the area, by
(i) the demolition or repair, as the circumstances may require, of &apos; those dwelling houses which are unfit for human habitation;(ii) the purchase by the authority of any land in the area which it is expedient for them to acquire for opening out the area and, if any buildings on that land have not previously been demolished, -the demolition of those buildings, so far as it is necessary to demolish them for that purpose; and(iii) the abatement of overcrowding in the area;the authority may cause that area to be defined on a map, and may pass a resolution declaring the area so defined to be an improvement area.The Authority is required before passing the resolution to satisfy the Minister that the area is one in which the housing conditions can be remedied effectively within a reasonable period, and that the necessary steps will be taken to provide any necessary rehousing accommodation.The Authority&apos;s resolution must be advertised in the local press, but no Inquiry by the Minister is required at this stage.Having passed a resolution the local authority is required (Section 8)-(i) to deal with unfit houses under the powers described in 2 (b) above;(ii) to purchase any land required for opening out the area, and to carry out such demolitions as may be necessary for that purpose unless the owners are prepared to open it out adequately;(iii) to make and enforce byelaws for preventing and abating overcrowding in the area and generally for securing the improvement of housing conditions, and the subsequent maintenance of a proper standard of housing conditions.These byelaw powers extend the scope of the local authority&apos;s powers, as previously such powers were confined to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family.If, in order to purchase land for opening out the area, the local authority have to proceed by Compulsory Purchase Order, the Minister of Health must, if there are objections on grounds other than price, direct the holding of a Public Local Inquiry which is advertised beforehand, and at which all interested persons can appear and give evidence!3. Public Health Acts.The fitness of a dwelling for human habitation may also be dealt with by local authorities under the Public Health Acts, which, require them to carry out inspections to detect nuisances and enable them to take action to remove them. section 91 of the Public Health Act, 1875, includes among the definitions of nuisances which are to be dealt with summarily &quot; any premises in such a state as to be a nuisance or injurious to health.&quot;Other provisions of the Public Health Acts Telate to the provision of sanitary accommodation and water supply (sections 36 and 62 of the Act of 1875 and sections 39-42 of the Act of 1907).4. Power of Local Authority to acquire properties for the purpose of repair, alteration, enlargement or improvement.A local authority may acquire houses by agreement under Section 57 (1) (c) or Section 58 (2) of the Housing Act, 1925, and under Sections 57 (1) (d) and 57 (2) the Authority have power to alter, enlarge, repair or improve such houses.A local authority may acquire a dwelling compulsorily for the purpose of reconditioning where, as noted in Part 2 above, a house is acquired which has been represented by them as capable of being made fit at a reasonable expense, and the Court, on appeal, has decided against them.

Housing (Bural Workers) Acts, 1926 and 1931.These Acts provide that local authorities who are authorities for the pur-poses of the Acts may submit to the Minister schemes with respect to the reconstruction and improvement of houses or buildings, and may, in aeeord-ance with such schemes, give assistance in. respect of any&quot;such works of reconstruction or improvement.The provisions of the Acts apply only to houses, the value of which, when the approved works of improvement have been carried out, does not exceed  400, and assistance is not available in aid of works costing less than  .50. The Acts exclude works of ordinary repairs and upkeep except in so far as they are incidental to the work of improvement or reconstruction.The assistance given by the local authority, which may be in the form of a lump sum or by payments spread over 20 years, must not exceed two-thirds of the estimated cost of the works, or  100. One-half of the local authority&apos;s expenses in making grants is refunded to them by the Exchequer over a period of 20 years, so that the approved cost is borne in equal shares by the owner, the local authority and the Exchequer.The local authority may as an alternative or in addition to a grant make a loan to cover the owner&apos;s share of the cost of the works within the limits of an approved estimate.The Acts require that a building reconstructed or improved with the aid of grant shall be occupied by a person of the class which the Acts were designed to help and let at a low rent. The building must be occupied, if the assistance given to the owner is not to be repaid by him, for 20 years by an agricultural worker or person of substantially the same economic condition, and the rent must not be increased by more than 3 per cent, of the estimated expenditure incurred by the owner. Where the building has not previously been occupied the criterion is the rent normally paid by a tenant of the class referred to above.In the event of a breach of the conditions the payment of grant is dis-continued and the grant already paid must be refunded together with compound interest calculated from the date or dates of payment.6. Sent Sestrictions Acts.A tenant can apply to the Court for an order suspending the whole of the 40 per cent, permitted increase of rent, if he is able to satisfy the Court by a certificate of the sanitary authority, or otherwise, that the house is not in a reasonable state of repair; alternatively, he may withhold the 40 per cent, increase, and, if he is sued for payment, may put in the certificate as presumptive (though not conclusive) evidence that the house is not in a reasonable state of repair. The new Rent Restrictions Act makes it a duty of a local authority to issue such a certificate on application if satisfied that the house is not in a reasonable state of repair. The Act also provides that a local authority shall not refuse a certificate under the Rent Acts in respect of a house on the owner of which they have served a notice under section 17 of the Housing Act, 1930, requiring the execution of works in the house.The new Act empowers borough and district councils to publish information as to the rights and duties of landlords and tenants under the Acts and as to the procedure for enforcement; and empowers the Minister to prescribe the matters in regard to which notice in rent books and similar documents is to be given to tenants.A landlord has power under the Acts to increase the rent by an amount equivalent to 8 per cent, on expenditure on improvements or structural alterations (not being decoration or repairs), and this provision has been extended in the new Act to include the provision of additional or improved fixtures or fittings.(8/33)  (21012r-52)   Wt. 2151-1259  1000 10/33 P.
