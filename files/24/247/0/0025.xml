CONFIDENTIAL .C.2B6.BOARD OP-TRAPS ADVISORY COUNCIL,STATE OF TRADE - DECEMBER, 1955.Summary of Reports submitted &quot;by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases by statistical Information from other sources).Employment.    The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges in G-reat Britain at 18th December was 2,324.079, a decrease of 55,938 as compared with 20th November. The number wholly unemployed including casuals decreased by 24,624, and the number temporarily stopped by 31,314.The changes between 20th November and ICth December in the different divisions were as follows:-The estimated number of insured persons in employment at 18th December was 10,008,000, this being 52,000 more than a month before and 568,000 more than a year before.There was a further improvement in coal mining, engineering, shipbuilding and ship-repairing, steel melting and rolling, miscellaneous metal goods manufacture, motor and other vehicle building, the manufacturing section of the cotton industry and the distributive trades.   Employment also improved in textile bleaching, dyeing, etc., tailoring^  printing and bookbinding, and in the road transport, shipping, hotel and boarding house services.    The seasonal decline continued in building and public works contracting, and there was a setback in the pottery, boot and shoe, leather, hosiery and lace industries.Overseas Trade,,    Imports during December were  63,162,000 compared with  60,666,000 in December, 1932, while exports wereLondon.......oo.co..South Eastern.....o oSouth Western.....e.Midlands............North Eastern.....o.North Western.......Scotland............li/ales.............**- 6,107* 7,258* 4,954- 9,165 -36,391 -21,265 4- 3,763 + 1,015-1-
 30,430,000 compared with  32,445,000.    Exports of imported., merchandise were  4,043,000 compared with  4^U33r0OC and transhipments under bond were  1,949,000 compared with  2,099,000,Imports for the whole year 1933 amounted to  675,847,000 as against  701,670,000 in 1932.    Exports of United Kingdom goods were  367,424,000 compared with  365,024,000, and re-exports  49,078,000 compared with  51,021,000.Rail and Road Traffic.    Railway traffic receipts for the four weeks ended 31st December, 1933, were  573,000 (5.32^ more than in the corresponding period of 1932/33).    The increase was due mainly to merchandise, minerals, ;nd livestock. Receipts for the 52 weeks ended 31st December shewed a decrease of  109,000 (0.08;&apos;), due wholly to coal, coke and patent fuel.The number of passengers.,, excluding season ticket holders, conveyed by standard gauge railways, other than those of the London Passenger Transport Board and the v/hitechapel and Bow Joint Railway, during October was 1,445,000 more than in the corresponding month of 1932.The number of motor vehicles, other than motor cycles, newly registered in November, 1933, was 4,140 (23*0 more than in the corresponding period of 1932.    The increase comprised 2,485 private cars and 1,655 goods and other vehicles. Registrations of motor cycles show a decrease of 471 (21.6^).Retail Trade.   Retail sales during November were 2.8$o greater in value than in November, 1932.    Sales of food and perishables were 1.5$4 greater and of other commodities 3.9^ greater.    The largest increases were in hardware, men&apos;s and boys&apos; wear and furniture.    Stocks were 0.6^ less in value than a year before.An increase in both food and non-food sales was shown in every district except that in the &quot;West End of London there was a decrease of 0.5^ in food sales.
In departmental stores, sales in November were 3.greater than in November, 1932.     In the United States there was an increase of 2%, and in Germany a decrease of 20.3^: in similar stores.Finance (a) London. The comparative steadiness of the foreign exchanges during December led to e somewhat greater feeling of confidence than in the previous month.The bank note circulation at Christmas reached  392j,OO0y00C, the largest figure since the amalgamation of tii^ note issues in 1928.Discount rates following the usual trend rose towards the middle of December, reaching on the 15th a maximum of 31.3.11 for the Treasury bill tender.     The last tender of the year on the 29th dropped, however, to 19/4d.     It is feared that the normally reduced offering of Treasury bills in the last quarter of the financial year will force discount rates down.As expected by the market, the Treasury have announced that  105,000,000 of 4f!- Treasury bonds will be repaid on the 15th April, 1934.The Australian Government hr.ve converted five State loans of 5-5^6 interest by the issue of .316,000,000 in the form of a 3t loan at 99 with a life of 13 to 16 years.(b) France.   The passage of the Budget has not fundamentally improved the position of French public finances. Some of the sources for meeting the deficit are of a   non-recurring nature and even if th^ anticipated yield is realised, it really means that the deficit is to a large extent passed on to future years.     A new series of 5 to 15 year 5 j Treasury bonds has been issued at 97^- to ease the Treasury position due to the sluggish flow of tax receipts, to meet the heavy maturities in the next six months and to consolidate a part of the floating debt.
(c) Germany.     The Reichsbank has announced that in 1954 only 30&apos;t of the interest on the external debt will be remitted abroad in cash, the remainder being paid in KonversionBkasse scrip.     There is considerable controversy not only as to the necessity for this step but also on account of the preferential* treatment to Swiss and Dutch long term creditors who are to secure payment in full,  the countries concerned undertaking to accept additional exports from Germany in return.Industrial activity in G-germany has improved, recently as shown by the increase in bills discounted,  the falling off in bankruptcies and the increase in thJ yield of the Stock Exchange turnover tax.The Reichsbank rate remained unaltered at 4% throughout1933.(d) U.S.A.    The measures recently taken by iresident Roosevelt hove succeeded in satisfying his supporters and placating his opponents.     The ratification of the London Silver Agreement and the provision for the uionetization of virtually all the domestic production of silver have won the support of the silver interests at a small cost, as the dangers of inflation from this move ar-J negligible.     The new budget which provides for expenditure on a vast scale has won over the inflationists, while on the other hand the President&apos;s promise to raise his requirements by way of loans and io balance the budget by 1935/36 has eased the minds of the more orthodox.      The questions now being asked are whether this vast expenditure on public works will, in fact, succeed in giving the American economic machine sufficient impetus to enable it to continue of its own momentum once this expenditure ceases,  and whether it will be possible to balance ths budget by the time stated.
The President&apos;s messages to Congress contain no definite declaration on monetary policy.     As it is proposed to raise $10,000 n,  in the next six months by means of loans.) the bond market will have to be kept firm.There is a general feeling in the United States that the worst of the slump is past.      Steel production rose steadily during December and Christmas trade is reported as being the best since 1920.Ooalr,     The output of coal for the 51 weeks January 1st to December 23rd, 1933, was 208,121,000 tons compared with 209,704,000 tons in 1932.      In each of the four weeks ended December 23rd, however, the output was greater than in the corresponding week of 1932.The number of persons employed in the industry on 23rd December was 780,500 compared with 782,400 on the correspond ing date in 1932 and the output per person in the week ending 23rd December was 6.23 tons compared v/ith 6*12 tons in the corresponding week in 1932.Exports during December, 1933, were 3,049,000 tons compared with 3,089,000 tons in December, 1932.      Among the countries to which exports increased may be mentioned Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany and Prance.      Shipments as bunKers were 1,152,000 tons compared with 1,287,000 tons.On the Horth-Sast coast the export trade improved during the last three months of 1933 as a result of the Trade Agreements and also of the efforts of coal owners to prepare their coal in accordance with c ontineivfcal standards.In Scotland; export conditions remained satisfactory but in South Walls ft there wao no improvement.      The Midlands experienced an improved demand for domestic fuel on account of cold weather and industrial demand was also bettor.
Shipping.      The index of shipping freights (191S a 100) for December was 87.95 compared with 80.56 in November and 84.15 in the previous December.    The gross tonnage of shipping laid up at the beginning of 1954 was 2,036,000 tons compared with 3,194,000 tons at the beginning of 1933.    During 1933, the tonnage sold to foreign shipowners for use and to British and foreign shipbreakers amounted to 1,245,000 tone.The merchant shipping under construction on the 31st December amounted to 332,000 gross tons, an increase of 28,000 tons on the previous Quarter and of 106,000 tons on the last quarter of 1932.    Of the total tonnage being built in the world at the end of December, 43,8% was in Great Britain and Ireland. Iron and Steel.    The output of pig iron in December was 409,300 tons compared with 284,500 tons in December, 1932, and of steel ingots and castings 668,900 tons compared with 430,400 tons. For the whole of 1933 the pig iron output was approximately 15&quot;? and the crude steel output about 33^ greater than in 1932.The present outlook in the iron and steel industry is more encouraging than at any time since the slump.   Most of the available business in semi-finished material is being obtained by domestic producers.    New business in finished steel is also fairly active although increased competition from continental producers is reported in certain products.In Scotland, the improvement reported last month has been fully maintained.    The additional orders placed -with the Clyde shipbuilding yards have produced a favourable change in outlook.    Export trade continues however, to be unsatisfactory and orders from the normal consuming markets are very scarce. Prices of raw materials tend to move upwards.    The price of scrap has risen by about 15/- per ton during the past six months
but prices of finished products so far show no change.   On the North-East Coast, the tonnage on the order books shows an increase over the preceding month, the improvement being mainly due to an expansion of domestic demand.    The improvement in demand for semi-finished material noted during the past few months is now extending to finished steel products.    In South Wales the makers of sheet and tin plate bars are fairly well occupied but the future outlook is not very favourable on account of the falling-off in the demand for tin plates and galvanised sheets.    Welsh tinplate makers   have lost orders in certain markets to American and German manufacturers.    The position in the heavy steel trade has improved slightly.    In Sheffield   the orders received are regarded as very satisfactory.    Forward business in pig iron is expected to develop in the next few weeks and an expansion of output will probably be necessary before long,    The demand for basic steel billets is exceptionally good.    The heavy forges are still busily occupied with recent orders for shipbuilding and railway material.Cotton.     Activity in the cotton industry reached its highest 19?3 level during November and then suffered the usual seasonal decline in December.   After making allowance for Christmas holidays the fourth quarter showed a marked improvement.    Average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to the mills were 24.8 million lbs. In December compared with 29.8 million lbs. in November and 24.7 million lbs. in December, 1932.    The total deliveries for 1933 were greater than in any year since 1929.Activity in the ;^yptian section of the spinning industry continues to be greater than in the American. Conditions in the weaving section were also better during the last three months but there are still disputes regarding the &quot;more looms&quot; question.
Raw cotton prices fell during November but recovered in December and have continued to strengthen in the New Year. The operation of the price fixing agreement covering all sections of the spinning industry should lead to firmer yarn prices in future.    Cloth prices on the whole have also improved.    Exports of yarn and piece goods recovered during November but slackened again in December.    The total exports for 1933 did not reach the 1932 level.Wool.     Unemployment in the wool industry in December, 1933 was only 9,2% as compared with 19.0-j in December, 1932, and the index of machinery activity was 84.4&apos;*.   Exports of wool tops and yarn in December were less than in the previous month, but for the year as a whole exports of tops, yarns and tissues were in each case greater than in 1932.Raw wool prices have continued to move upwards but the increase has not yet been fully reflected in prices of tops and yarns, and even less so in the case of the finished article. Electricity.     The production of electricity during December was 1,536,million units compared with 1,269 million units in December, 1932.    The total amount of electricity generated by authorised undertakings during the year 1933 was 13,554 million units an increase of 10,7% on 1932.The percentage of productive capacity occupied fell to slightly over 50?? owing to the completion of certain large contracts in the home market.    Home orders for heavy plant were smaller than in December, 1932, but export orders improved. Machine Tools.    The home market position is satisfactory.    There is a lag in the demand for the heavier machine tools, but here an improvement is expected.
Machine tool manufacturers are considering the possibilities of Poland as an export market,December exports of machine tools were only .359,000 compared with .3167,000 in 1932.      Of these 53,000 went to the Soviet Union, compared with  119,000 in December, 1932..Motqr Industry.    The new French quota which came into force at the beginning of 1934 ie causing considerable anxiety In the industry.In Spain the 35$ reduction in customs duty granted to French cars has been extended to British cars as from 1st October, 1933.The proposal of the Argentine Government to remove the exchange control is likely to delay the entry of United Kingdom motor manufacturers into that market.United Litates competition in overseas markets is increasing and prices have been reduced.Chemicals.    Deliveries of heavy chemicals declined in December on account of Christmas holidays but export shipments were v/ell maintained.      Ihe slackening in demand for sulphuric acid experienced earlier in the year has been completely made up,Sal^sof dyestuffs fell off during December owing to the usual slackness prior to annual stocktaking.     Trade in the main dye-consuming industries continues good.The demand for coal tar products is active, and the use of creosote as a substitute for heavy petroleum oils is spreading as a result of the new duties on heavy hydrocarbon oils.     The difficulties which were anticipated in the change over to creosote do not appear to have been encountered.Paper.    The home demand for paper and paper boards during . December was better than in December, 1932, and the production of British mills was definitely higher.     The increased demand also led to larger imports of wrapping paper during November.     The export figures for November show a small decline compared with
November, 1932, but the export of printing and writing papers to Australia and bouth Africa continues to increase.     The depreciation of the dollar appears to be increasing the competitive power of Canada in overseas markets.The price of mechanical pulp has risen owing to the probable curtailment of production in Norway and Finland resulting from the shortage of water after the dry cummer of 1933,Cement,   During t?he first 10 months of 1933 the British share of the export market in cement diminished.     Denmark,  Italy, Japan, United btates and &quot;Jugoslavia all increased their percentage of the world trade.     The competitive position of Italy and Yugoslavia is due almout entirely to the utate subsidy of Italian shipping, and has led to considerable inroads into British trade on the West Coast of Africa, in India, and Ceylon,      Belgium is also recovering the ground lout in the early part of 1933, Although world prices of cement fell to only a very small extent during 1933,  the productive capacity of the world increased considerably and there seems little prospect of any increase in the world price.Other industries.,   The home demand for ruober tyres ic still good but export trade ir. difficult.      The position in the rubber footwear market remains unchanged.      oales of margarine are still&apos; adversely affected by the low prices of butter and for the whole year 1933 showed a reduction of nearly lO/J as compared with 19o2,      Prices of edible oils and fats will have to be reduced from the beginning of January.Canadian Trade.    Imports in November amounted to 43,712,000 dollars, a higher figure than in any month since May, 1932. Exports were the largest cince December, 1930.     The excess of exports over imports was 17,215,000 dollars compared with 8,852,000 dollars in November, 1952.The index of the physical volume of business and the index of manufacturing production wore both lower than in October. Mineral production was in general also at. a lower level.      The
index of wholesale prices was 6Ba7% compared with 67.9^ in October.      The price of No.l Northern wheat roce from 60.5 cents per bushel to 63.7 cents during November.The estimated wheat production for 1933 was lower than in any year since 1924.Australian Trade.    Imports during November amounted to 36,831,000 compared with 57,081,000 in 1932.     Statistics of exports are not yet available.From the 1st July to the ond of November 19^3 , 2,108,000 bales of wool wore received into store of which 1,231,000 bales were disposed of by sale and nhipmont,,      The average price for greasy wool rose at the December sales to 14.3d. -per pound.The 1933 total of bank clearings in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane showed in each ca^e an increase over the previous year. The Post Office and Customs revenue for the last 6 months of 193 was also greater than in 1932.
