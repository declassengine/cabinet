HIS DOCUMENT IS TEE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.)SJJ K E T117 -1 \COPY NO. E^Ll^LU A&apos; ji 1 i!1    t    i&quot;J     h     T1PROPOSED RAILWAY ELECTRIFICATION IN london memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer^1. The Minister of Transport&apos;s memorandum (CP. 38 (34)expresses his view that if the Government desire to press the London Traffic pool to proceed with electrification and a new tube at an early date, they must consider whether they are prepared to offer financial assistance. 2. It should be appreciated that a considerable time must elapse before any works could be started even if the Board were prepared to proceed with their proposals at the present time,    private bill legislation would be required and it is improbable that airy substantial beginning could be made before the end of 1935 at the earliest.    There is, therefore, no immediate   employment value in the proposals. It is also interesting to note that at a recent meeting of the Trade and Employment Panel Sir Jo siah Stamp expressed doubts whether  the schemes would ultimately give as much employment as might at first be thought.3. I am, however, in entire agreement with the Ministerof Transport that it is very desirable that the improvements outlined by the Standing joint Committee should be carried out as early as possible.    At the same time I am unable to find any grounds on which Exchequer assistance towards the cost of carrying out the works could be justified.
4. It appears to me difficult to imagine a less meritor-ious subject for State aid than London passenger transport. London has a more intensive traffic and probably lower traffic fares than any other great city and to suggest that London passengers should be subsidised by the general taxpayers seems, in present circumstances, definitely.contrary to the public interest.5. Practically every supporter of the London passenger transport Act based his support on the assumption that when London Passenger Transport was under one management and the whole of the traffic receipts were pooled, nothing v/ould stand in the   way of all necessary improvements and developments. An extract from Lord Ashfield&apos;s speech is quoted by the Minister.      On Third Reading,  the Minister of Transport said -&quot;In the Governments opinion,  the provision of facilities like these (extensions and developments) should be found by the combined and pooled resources of the transport undertakings of the area.      They should not be a charge either upon the Exchequer or upon the London ratepayer&quot;.The Attorney General,  in winding up the debate for the Government,  took much the same line and throughout the debates the Government left little doubt in Parliament that further subsidies to London Transport would not be given. 6. The Transport Board will be subjected to the strongest possible pressure by the travelling public of the North Eastern suburbs to put these necessary improvements in hand. After Lord Ashfield had maae the statement in the House of Lords which is quoted in the Minister&apos;s memorandum, he went on to explain the importance and urgency of building a new tube railway and electrifying the suburban lines which he submitted v/ould be made possible by the London Passenger Transport Act.
These statements were made in March 1933 when conditions were less favourable than they are at the present time and the Board will find it almost impossible to delay action very long.      They will certainly he unable to shift the responsibility for the non-execution of the works on to the Government.7.      It must be borne in mind that so long as Lord Ashfield has sound business reasons for not embarking cn schemes at once, he is in a strong tactical position to ask for Exchequer assistance if he is pressed by the Government to expedite the work.      I have little doubt, however,  that if it is made clear that Exchequer assistance will not be offered, and will be refused if asked,, the pool will be obliged, as soon as their organisation is in order and they are on firm ground as regards their liabilities, to go to Parliament for power to proceed with these essential improvements.      They can scarcely justify their existence unless they start to take action as scon as their initial difficulties are over.      Lord Ashfield may safely be trusted to find the necessary ways and means if he is convinced that he cannot rely on Government aid.      But to induce him to go faster than he is prepared, under public pressure, to go on his own resources is,  in my opinion, i*u justifiable on economic grounds,  foreign to the conception of the London Passenger Transport Act and seriously embarrassing to the whole future relations of the Board and the Government.(Intd.) N.C.r-easury, s.V/. 1, February 12th,  1934.
