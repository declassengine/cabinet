SECRET. C.P.  50 (34).C A B I NET.NATIONAL MARITIME -MUSEUM; Sir James Caird&apos;s offer.Note by the Prime Minister.(1)      The project of establishing a Maritime Museum on a National scale dates from early in the century.      It took practical form about ten years ago when the Society for Nautical Research began to call attention to the fact that many of our unique naval relics had passed by sale to public or private collections in foreign countries, and that several of the remaining famous collections,  such as the Macpherson Collection of Naval Prints and the Mercury Collection of Ship Models, were in imminent danger of being broken up and similarly lost to the country.      The Society urged that there was insufficient incentive to private individuals to buy these collections for the Nation, so long as there was no definite prospect of the foundation of a Maritime Museum on a National scale in which they could be preserved and made accessible to the public.In 1927 a public statement to the effect that upon the removal of the Royal Hospital School from Greenwich to Holbrook in about five years from that date, the Queen&apos;s House at Greenv/ich (meaning the block of buildings of which it forms the centre) would be allocated for the purposes of the Museum, was authorised by the First Lord of the Admiralty after con-sultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the First Commissioner of Works,  and was made by the Chairman of the Council of the Society at their Annual Meeting (8th June,  1927) Since then many valuable gifts have been made in anticipationCOPY NO.      *JTTHIS DO GUMS NT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. )
of the establishment of a Museum and have been in charge of a &quot;body of temporary Trustees, legally constituted for this purpose towards the close of 1927 at the instance of the First Lord of the Admiralty.      In particular Sir James Caird, who has taken a keen interest in the project, has acquired privately many ships models, pictures, and other objects with a view to handing them over to the Museum.     His purchases include the Macpherson Collection of Naval Prints and the Mercury Collection of Ships Models;    these he has already entrusted to the care of the temporary Trustees.      I am informed privately, though Sir James Caird has not stated any figure, that his purchases have amounted in value to over  300,000.(2)     The Royal Hospital School vacated Greenwich inApril 1933.      In December last I received a letter from sir james Caird offering to make a Deed of Gift of his remainingcollections to a National Maritime Museum, and furthermore todefray the cost of adapting and equipping the buildings atGreenwich required for the Museum according to the estimate ofthe Office of Works (viz.  29,000), subject to three conditions.      That provision shall be made during the financial year 1934-35 for the inauguration of the Museum:2.      That the Museum shall be controlled by Trustees appointed by the Prime Minister of the day, and that they shall be directly responsible to the Treasury:3.      That the site of the Queen&apos;s House and of theSchool buildings be thrown into Greenwich Park, the Government providing the necessary funds to lay it out and to maintain it as part of the Park.(3)    A scheme as follows has now been prepared by the Departments concerned:-
(a) The Museum to he established in the West wing immediately, and ultimately in both wings of the buildings of which the Queen&apos;s House is the centre. It is contemplated that the Queen&apos;s House itself, which was built by Inigo Jones and is of historic interest, will be open to the public, but that it will only contain exhibits of such nature and to such extent as not to interfere with the beautyof the House.(b) The property to be transferred without payment by the Admiralty to the Office of Works for the purposes of the Museum.(c) The Museum to be controlled by an independent body of Trustees appointed in the usual manner by the Prime Minister, the necessary funds being provided in a new vote.(d) The site to be converted into park land at some later date.      (Estimated cost  7,500).(4)     A.part from the non-recurrent expenditure on initial adaptation and equipment of the buildings, which would be re-, paid by Sir James Caird., and on the conversion of the site into park land, which would be deferred until some later year, the expenditure involved would be:-(a) an annual charge (less saving of  1,200 on Navy Votes) of perhaps  15,000 per annum, including allied services, on the maintenance of the Museum; only a fraction of this would be required in 1934, and it would probably be some time before the full figure was reached.(b) a non-recurrent expenditure of  15,000 to be incurred in 1934 and 1935 by the Office of Workson the Queen&apos;&apos;s House as an Historic Building.      This expenditure would be coincident with but not, dependent on.the establishment of a Museum.The first step would be to introduce a Bill for the estab-lishment of the Museum.    The Bill would contain a clauseempowering the Admiralty to make a free grant of the property.(5)      The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the First Lord of the Admiralty and the First Commissioner of Works agree to this scheme and I submit it for Cabinet approval.(Intld.)    J.R.M.10 Downing Street, S.W.1.February 19th, 1934.
