C1&apos;TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.184OCUMENTGOVERNMENT.It is. requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.3D23(34)NO -CABINET.Mineral rights,in Petroleum in Great Britain. Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet last November (Cabinet 66 (33), Conclusion 6), I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues the draft of a Bill to give effect to the proposals which I put before them, together with a brief memorandum explaining the clauses of the Bill.In view of the desire of my colleagues that the Bill should be kept most secret, there has been no consultation with any Government Department or other interests except that Clause 2 (which provides for the payment of a royalty to the Government) has been agreed with the Treasury.      The Treasury has also concurred in Clause 4.      It is possible therefore that some minor alterations may be found necessary at a later stage, but, these could be dealt with after a decision has been reached on the question of principle.I would draw special attention to the proviso to Clause 1In my previous memorandum, I explained that the application from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (which has been f^llotfed by informal approaches from other concerns) makes it desirable that an early decision should be reached.      I hope therefore that I may be authorised to make the announcement referred to in paragraph 10 (f) of my memorandum CP. 279 (33;.W.R.ard of Trade. January, 1934.
PETROLEUM (PRODUCTION) BILL. EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM^Clause 1.Under this Clause, the property in any petroleum which may exist in this country is vested in the Crown, and the Crown is given the exclusive right of searching and &quot;boring for and getting petroleum.     The Crown will thus own the oil and he able to secure that the search for and production of oil shall he carried out in an orderly manner.The proviso to this Clause exempts any petroleum which may he obtained from areas in respect of which licences have already been granted under the Petroleum (production) Act, 1918.      There are three of these licences still operative, and they are scheduled to the Bill. Clause 2.Sub-Clauses (1) and (2) .     Persons desiring to search for and get petroleum will be required to obtain a licence from the Board of Trade, acting on behalf of the Crown,  and the Board of Trade is given power to determine the terms and conditions of licences.      The financial consideration will be settled in consultation with the Treasury.The licences may be of two kinds (a) a prospecting licence, and (b) a mining licence or lease.     The basis of payments in the two cases would be quite different. Generally speaking, the prospecting licence will be for a short period, of say,  two or three years, and either a lump sum or an annual amount would be charged.     A mining licence or lease would cover a much longer period (periods
up to 70 years are not uncommon) and besides a royalty payment on a tonnage basis there would probably be provision for a ;ainimum annual rent.   It is considered desirable not to attempt to prescribe the financial terms at this stage.   If oil should be discovered in commercial quantities, it would be possible to settle rates of royalties and minimum rents on some definite basis for the future.   For the time being, however, these terms can be settled for each case as it arises by the Board of Trade and the Treasury.    The Petroleum Department of the Board of Trade has a great deal of inforiaatioii of the rates of royalty unu oth^r   financial aonbiuerutione paid in all the principal oil producing countries, and the best terms possible will be secured.    The provisional talks which have already taken place with the Anglo-Persian oil Company inuicate that they are prepared to offer quite good terms. Clause 2.   Sub-clause (5)    This Clause makes it clear that thegrant of a licence will not interfere with the existing rights of owners of the surface, and that licensees will have to secure the facilities they need for carrying on their operations, either by agreement with landowners or where such agreement cannot be secured, by applying to the Railway and Canal Commission under the provisions of the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act, 1923, for the grant of the necessary rights.   &quot;Where arrangements are made on a voluntary basis the compensation to be paid will be agreed between the parties,    ^ere an application is made to the Railway and Canal Commission, the Commission has power to settle terms.
Clause 2.    Sub-clause (4).        This Clause applies theprovisions of Part I of the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act, 1923, to applications which may be made to the Railway and Canal Commission under this Bill.    The question of pipe lines for conveyance of oil is an important matter in connexion with petroleum working under the Bill,     Any licensee desiring to construct a pipe line will have to go to the Railway, and Canal Commission for an Order if the pipe line is to cross a public highway at any point. This will give the Commission the opportunity of examining all such pipe line schemes before they are approved and enable interested parties to raise objections.   Where the Commission makes an Order they will incorporate such of the sections of the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847, as are mentioned in the Bill as it considers desirable.    These sections relate to rights to break up the roads, giving notice to interested authorities, keeping a plan of pipe line schemes, etc. Glause 3.In the search for petroleum it is often the case that considerable quantities of gas are met with, and in certain instances this must either be wasted or used for industrial purposes.    This Clause would enable an oil company, with the approval of the Board of Trade, to Bell the gas to an industrial undertaking, but the gas must first have been offered at a reasonable price- to an authorised gas undertaking. Clause 4.This Clause provides for the keeping of an account
of any receipts from royalties etc., and of expenses of administration. Olause 5.This Olause gives the Board of Tra-de power to make regulations as to the procedure for making application for licences and kindred matters, and also enables the Board to prescribe model clauses which would form the basis of licences. Clause 6.This Olause gives the same powers to inspect plans of mines to technical officers and inspectors of the Petroleum Department of the Board of Trade as are given to inspectors of mines.     This is necessary to ensure that if oil borings are in the neighbourhood of other mining operations the necessary preoautions can be taken for safety purposes. Clause 7.Empowers the Secretary for nines to aot for the Board of Trade. Clause 8.Re-enacts an existing provision in the Petroleum (Production) Act, 1918, but in the later form of this provision as1 included in the mining Industry Act, 1936, to enable the Geological Survey to secure geological information. Olause 9.Re-enacts an existing provision in the Petroleum (Production) Act, 1918. Olause 10.Sub-clause (g) .     The Cabinet direction, that the three small areas in respect of which licences granted under the 1918 Act are still in operation, should be excluded, has been interpreted to mean that any oil which may exist under these lands should not be deolared State property (see Olause 1  (l)) but that in other respects these licences should be treated as if they had been issued under this Bill.
