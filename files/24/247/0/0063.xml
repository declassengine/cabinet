3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.C A B I.....NET.REDUCTION OP HOURS OP WORK. or .Reply to Inta rnatiortaI Labour Office Questionnaire. MEMORANDUM BY MINISTER OF LABOUR.It is necessary to send an early reply to a Questionnaire issued &quot;by the International Labour Office on the subject of the reduction of hours of work, a subject which is to be further discussed at the International Labour Conference of this year. The Questionnaire centres round the point as to whether Governments are or are not in favour of the adoption next June of an international Convention providing for a 40 hour working week oi&quot; v/ide application,I attach paper T.5o0.(32)31 which I circulated to the Trade and Employment Committee recently and which gives an account of the present position and a summary of the considera-tions involved,      I also attach a copy of the relevant minutes of the meeting of that Committee held on 7th February.The 40 hour working week proposal is one of considerable public interest and it can be anticipated that any declaration of policy made by the British Government with regard to it will be the subject of widespread discussion.,      The reply to Geneva defining the attitude of H.M.Government is, therefore, one of considerable importance entailing, as it does,  aecisions upon the following major points:-lo    Does HoM.  Government consider that international regula-tions designed to reduce hours of work should be proceeded with forthwith? 2.    If so,  should they be on the basis of a 40 hour week,  orThe views expressed by my    colleagues on the Trade and Employment Committee suggested that the answer to tho firstmmP.63(34).on the basis of some other number of hours;    and what should be the nature and scope of these regulations?
(intd. )   H. B.Snd March,  1934squestion is in the negative and that the second question does not therefore arise.      This is clearly my own view, and on this basis I have prepared a draft of a letter, and accompanying statement, which I propose to send to the Director of the International Labour Office      I attach copies of these documents which are designed to make it clear that, for the reasons given, H.M0Government is opposed to the immediate formulation of international regulations concerning hours of work - whether they attempt to maintain wages or not - but suggests that the subject is one which can be usefully discussed only industry by industry,      I should be glad to have the approval of my colleagues to the views expressed in the draft letter and statement,,
DRAFT. I.L.173/1933.The Director9The International Labour Office, Geneva.Sir 91, I am directed by the Minister of Labour to refer to your letter (Do 618/101) of 31st July,  1933, with which you enclosed the Red Report containing a Questionnaire on the subject of the Reduction of Hours of ^ork,      H.M.  Government in the United Kingdom has given the most serious consideration to this important subject and has proceeded to enquire into the relevant facts and considerations and to consult the interests most directly concerned with a view to reaching a sound judgment on the main issues set forth in the Questionnaire,,2o The enquiries and consultations referred to have not yet been concluded, but the facts and opinions so far elicited are sufficiently comprehensive to enable H.Ma  Government to reach a definite conclusion on the pivotal point of the Questionnaire, viz,.   the desirability or otherwise of adopting in June next an international Convention designed to reduce hours of work,,      On this point HoM.  Government, on the information before it,  is of opinion that the adoption of a Convention likely to be effective is impracticable.3. Having regard to the expression of view contained in the preceding paragraph,  it is not proposed to attempt to reply to the Questionnaire in the detailed form contemplated by the Red Report,    but there is attached:(a) a statement of relevant facts and considerations which have contributed to the conclusion reached byH. Mo Government j(b) a note with regard to the points contained in the Preamble in the Red Report.4.    In conclusion,    I am directed to state that H.M.Government does not take the view that weekly hours of work are immutably fixed at their present levels.     A continuous review of the
problem industry by industry will,  in the opinion of Ff.M.  Government, reveal the scope for useful action as and where this exists and it is contended that the question of the limitation of hours can only be dealt with, either nationally or internationally,  industry by industry in the light of the special characteristics of each industry,,I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,
S T A T B M E N T.Proposal for a Convention,makin^no, provision foi&apos; the maintenanceof wages and salaries,,(i) The subjects of hours and wages cannot properly be separated. The two subjects are invariably regarded as interdependent by the negotiators of industrial agreements.(ii) The strength of the Trade Unions differs widely in different countries.    In countries where there is no adequate protection of wages either by voluntary organisation or by legislation any additional cost arising from a reduction of working hours might be offset by a reduction of wages.&apos;   This would affect the wages position in other countries, having regard to competition in world markets,  and industrial strife would arise from proposals to make corresponding reductions.(iii) In the United Kingdom the Trades Union Congress General Council has expressed the view that a Convention should not be framed on the basis that no provision should be made for the maintenance of wages and salaries.    Legislation on the basis of a Convention for the compulsory reduction of hours would be bound to make provision as regards -wages and no satisfactory Convention could be framed -which ignored this fact.Proposal for a Convention providing that wages and sal.ries will not be reduced by reason of its application.(i) A rigid limitation of hours to such a number as 40 would have widely different results in thevarious industries and services of this country.    There are industries or establishments whose agree-ments provide for little,  if at all, more than an average of 40 hours a week or in which not more than 40 hours are worked on the average over the year and the effect in those cases.would differ very widely from that in those industries which adhere to a 47 or a 48-hour week or in industries where work must be carried on continuously.(ii) A considerable amount of short-time working is already in operation,  so that the hours of employment of many workpeople would be unaffected by a reduced limit or affected to a comparatively small extent.
(iii) Those industries in which a rigid limit on hours could he met by an. increased rate of production would be effected in an entirely different way from those in which the machine sets the pace,(iv) Unless the number of shifts is increased, a rigid and reduced limit on hours of worlc would entail plant standing idle and&apos;this would be a matter of greater- significance for those industries whose plant is extensive and costly than for those in which plant is of less importance.    Where more shifts are impracticable the maintenance of production on the same level of individual output would involve expenditure on additional plant and accommodation,,(v) A reduction of hours and a maintenance of existing earnings is the  equivalent of an increase in the hourly rate of wages and, unless production is speeded-up,  of piece-rates.    The effect of such an increase would vary according to the proportion of the total cost of production represented by the Wages Bill which shows very wide variations,  industry by industry.(vi) Reference has been made to short-time arrangements.    The maintenance of the hourly rate would mean the same weekly earnings for those whose hours were reduced from the present normal to the new limit, but a rise of weelcly earnings for all those now on short-time.    Confusion and industrial strife could hardly fail to result.(vii) The percentage of unemployment varies widely amongst occupa-tions and it is impossible that any uniform effect would follow the imposition of a general limit on hours.    While an improvement in the employment situation might occur in some sections of industry,  in others the result would be detrimental,,(viii) In countries in which wages are comparatively high an increase of hourly rates amongst all the countries signatory to a Convention would multiply the difference of the wage-cost in favour of low-wage countries.    In the former countries this might lead to an increasein unemp1oyment.
(ix) The imposition of a general reduced limit on hours of employment would tend to stimulate reorganisation and mechanisation and so curtail employment.(x) The proposals  take no account of the number of shifts worked, a question which in certain industries,  e6g.s cotton,  is of not less importance than the hours of employment of the individual,,

There is no sanctity in the number of 40 in regard to weekly hours of work.    It is not a figure which is scientifically related either to current methods of organisation or to the social and industrial habits of the peoples of the world.      Moreover,  it is not seriously argued that -iO hours of work a week is the maximum which humanitarian considerations will permit.    The fact is that in origin the number 40 is a slogan designed to promote the movement towards shortening the hours of work with a view to relieving the unemployment position.    But the operations at Geneva have tended to elevate the slogan into an article of faith and to crystallise it in a creed for the acceptance of all,  regardless of the fact that not two industries are alike and that no two countries have the same historical, social and industrial background.    The differing wage standards in the various countries of the world is an example of a relevant factor which has tended to be ignored.    But, unreal as the Geneva operations may have been,  it is necessary to take stock of them and to d escribe very briefly their history.2.      Following preliminary discussions on the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, a    Tripartite Preparatory Conference on the question of the reduction of hours was held in Geneva in January,  1933.    The Report of the Conference was carried forward - together with supplementary matter - for the consideration of the 17th Session of the International Labour Conference held in the summer of 1933.    The latter Conference decided to proceed towards the formulation of a draft convention or recommendation on the subject of the reduction of the hours of work and to issue to Governments a series of questions with a view361
to drawing up definite international regulations at the Conference to be held in June 1934.    These questions are numerous and detailed, but they are for answer at once and they involve certain general issues which are matters of Government policy and which can only be decided as such.    Outstanding points requiring immediate decisions are as follows, and until these points are determined it is impossible to proceed with the questions as a whole:-(1)    Does the Government consider that further internationalregulations designed to reduce the hours of work should be proceeded with, forthwith?(2)    If so -(a) Should these regulations be on the basis of a 40 working hour week or some other number of hours?    (Note: The Washington 48 working Hour Week Convention is s till in being, although largely unratified).(b) What should be the scope of application of these regulations?    (Note:    So far, maritime and agricultural workers have been excluded from the field of consideration). (3)    If the answer to (1)  is in the negative, should this be a plain &quot;No.1  or one accompanied by suggestions as to alternative action?    In the latter case, what should the suggestions be?30      So far,  the activities of British Government representatives at Geneva have been mainly concerned with pointing out difficulties in the way of the further international regulation of hours of work and with pressing for a fuller consideration of the problem on the basis of ascertained facts.    This attitude naturally involved the Government in some responsibility in the matter of obtaining and examining relevant facts and opinions in Great Britain itself.    The Minister of Labour has taken action in this direction, and has been in active consultation by correspondence and by personal contact with the National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations, as representing the
employing interest, and. with the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, as reoresenting the workers.    The position of the Government as a large employer of labour has also been examined by the Treasury in co-operation with the principal employing Departments concerned.The consultations with the National Confederation of Employers&apos;  Organisations have been protracted and are not yet-complete.    So far, the results have been in certain respects disappointing.    The general attitude of the National Confederation is not in doubt:    it is one of uncompromising hostility to further international regulation of hours of work, and in one way or another the Confederation have produced general arguments of substance in support of their view.    They have not, however, produced the body of facts,  industry by industry, which were expected from them.    When asked to suggest methods of absorbing more workers into industry they have practically confined their proposals to(a) an indication that Government expenditure is too high and should be reduced; and(b) a suggestion that wage levels have been kept too high, particularly in fields where Government and Public Authority action has a direct influence.As indicated,  discussions with the Confederation are proceeding, but it is doubtful whether further results are likely to emerge in time to be useful in connection with the questions put by GenevaeThe attitude of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, may be briefly summarised as follows:-(a) It is desirable to proceed forthwith with international regulations designed to secure a 40 hour working week in all countries and in all industries,,(b) Reduction of hours of work should not be accompanied by any reduction of pay,
4o      The relevant questions in the International Labour Office Questionnaire were put by the Treasury, at the request of the Ministry of Labour,  to the Government Departments with industrial employees.    The questions and the results of the inquiry are in the attached note,     Main attention was directed to estimating the increased cost involved in introducing a 40 hour week and of estimating the additional number of Government workers which would be required under the proposed new conditions.    It is estimated that the introduction of a 40 hour week would entail an e xtra charge on the Exchequer to the extent of .33,246,400 (or about 18o9;&quot;&apos;: of the Wage Bill),  on the basis of the maintenance of present weekly wages for the reduced hours.    On the basis of no alteration in hourly rates or piece-rate^, an additional charge of  357,200 (or about 2,08-&apos; of the Wage Bill) would be entailed.    The numbers of additional employees which would be absorbed (whether or not existing earnings are increased)   are estimated at 14,890 or 14.09&quot;. of the total now employed.    These figures do not take into account the repercussions on other Government employees,  e. go manipulative grades in the G. ?0 0,5a      The case for the 40 hour working week to be instituted by international regulation is usually put forward along the following lines -(a) The increasing efficiency and productivity of machinery should lighten trie burden of labour required from the workers, who should thus be left with greater leisure.(b) Work should be shared more equitably than at present.    It is unreasonable that some should have a very full week of work while others are wholly unemployedo(c) While the introduction of a 40 hour week would, not abolish unemployment it would materially diminish its volume and thus do much to mitigate one of the chief evils afflicting modern civilisation.4o
(&amp;) Owing to the competition of countries in world markets and of individual undertakings within a country,  it is essential to have an international regulation of working conditions on advanced and humane lines.    Otherwise,  enlightened countries and undertakings will be at a disadvantage in competing with others with lower standards of working conditions^    Hours of work is an important aspect of working conditions and should be dealt with internationally in a progressive spirits6.      On the other ha no., many difficulties have been raised both at Geneva and at home with regard to the 40 hour working week proposals.    These may be summarised from the point of view of Great Britain as follows:-(a) Hours and wages are bound up together and c annot properly be dealt with s eparately in present circumstances.    But while it is conceivable that hours can be regulated inter-nationally, wages are not susceptible of being treated in this way.(b) British workers desire a shorter working week, but with the same pay.    It is impossible to s secure this by inter-national regulation.(c) British workers would not accept a shorter working week if this entailed a pro rata reduction in pay,,    The workers of certain other countries would do so, however, and the^iesult of a 40 hour week international convention would be that British employers would, feel compelled to attempt to reduce pay so as to be in a position to compete with other countries in world marketSc.    An era of industrial strike in Great Britain would follow,,(d) A shorter working week would be more costly to operate in high wage countries like Great Britain than in low wage countries.    In world markets, which are, of&quot; course,  of first importance to Great Britain,  the dice would,  therefore,, be loaded in favour of low wage countries.    Moreover, the question
is seriously affected by the number of shifts worked,  e. g,  in the cotton industry,  one shift is worked in this country and in India and two or three in Japan.(e) It is not reasonable to apply the same maximum working hours to all industries.    If 40 hours a week happens to be a suitable figure in some industries,  it will obviously be unsuitable in others.    President Roosevelt has recognised this in his National Recovery administration.(f) Shorter hours would give an impetus to mechanisation and reorganisation to reduce labour costs which would tend to curtail employment.(g) The proper administration of international regulation is impossible to secure in present conditions.    While a law enforcing a 40 hour week in Great Britain would be carried into effect,  experience indicates that a similar law in many other countries would either be ignored or be ineffectively applied.(h) If the 48 hour working week as laid down in the Washington Convention has secured only a very limited application, what hope is there for a 40 hour convention?7c      The International Labour Conference to be held in June of this year may decide to proceed with a 40 hour working week convention.    In this case it is anticipated that the convention will remain very largely a dead letter.    Many countries of industrial importance,  including the oriental countries, will certainly not be prepared to ratify such a convention, and this attitude will no doubt be regarded by other countries as a sufficient reason for their own abstention.    On the other hand, the Conference may decide to /jive attention to proposals of a less ambitious but more readily realisable nature.    One possible line of progress is the examination of the problem of working hours,  industry by industry, both nationally and inter-nationally.    Such a process certainly appears to be more along the lines of natural evolution than any attempt to impose a 40 hour week on all industries in all countries.    In ordinary . 6.
industrial settlements hours are always discussed in association with wages and it is impossible to disassociate them.    It is, of course, absurd to regard working hours as immutably fixed at their present levels, and to reduce the working week rather than lengthen it is the obvious development of the future.    Each industry might,  therefore, keep this question of hours constantly under review in order that all reasonable opportunities of reduc-ing the working week should be embraced.    In British industry this process of examination ia already at work in certain fields. The engineering industry, for instance,has proceeded   by way of(a) a demand from the workers for shorter hours;(b) a careful review by the organised employers of the relevant facts - with results published;(c) joint consultation between the two parties,  which is now proceeding,,The business cf the Government in such a matter may well be to Keep in close touch with both parties,  to assist with informa-tion,  and to help towards a aettlement which is not only reason-able for the industry but is in line with the national interest. The Engineering, Shipbuilding and Postal Workers Sections of Government employees have recently lodged claims for a shorter working week without redaction of pay,  and it will presumably be for the Government to examine such claims on their merits and to see whether present circumstances ma,:e it reasonable to travel along the line desired by the workers and.,  if so, at what pace.(Intld.)

This assumption uoes not take account of the serious practical difficulties tnat would arise, particularly in the case of employees on the lower ranges of pay,  in the way of reducing the individual&apos;s weekly earnings by 9% (in the case of men now working a 44 hour week)  to 16^-% (in the case of men now working a 48 hour week).      Some mitigation of these reauctions would probably be inevitable, with consequent increase of costs above the figure quoted.VI,,    Technical Practicability of reducing hours of work to 40 per week.The proposed reduction is considered not to be technically impracticable, but it is    evident both from explicit statements and from the implicit reliance on overtime, particularly in Admiralty
establishments,  that this is true only if consiaerable latitude as regards overtime is allowed.Questipnnaire.1.      On the question whether the limitation of hours ofemployment should take the form of an average weekly limit,  or that of a rigid limit for each week,   (paragraph 9 of Questionnaire),the replies at first sight display some divergence.      While theAir Ministry,  Office of Works, Stationery Office, and Post Officeprefer an average weekly limit (the period of averaging ranging from 6 to 8 weeks)  the Admix,alty and War Office prefer a rigidweekly limit.     But all Departments evidently contemplate thenecessity of exceeding the weekly limit on occasion;    and the comparatively heavy estimate of the cost of overtime in Admiraltyestablishments suggests that that Department would find itnecessary to maintain flexibility by habitual resort to overtime.2* Special Provisions for Small Establishments,(Pa&apos;ragrap*h&quot;&quot;l5&quot; of&quot; Questiohnglrej.Difficulties are anticipated in maintaining output at smallestablishments where it is not practicable to compensate for the shorter week by engaging additional employees.      These departments which require to use overtime freely in their larger establishmentsdo not consider special arrangements necessary for smaller units.In any case it appears impracticable to differentiate hourlyrates and overtime rates as between large and small establishments.3o Exclusion of Certain , Categories,,__(Paragraph 14 ofQu es t i onna ire).Such employees as Kightwatchmen, firemen, caretakers etc.,should be excluded from a limitation to 40 hours employment perweek.      In most Departments it is considered necessary also to exclude persons holding positions of supervision or managementwho are now remunerated by salary or upstanding wage inclusive of overtime.      Doubts are expressed whether these exclusions canbe stated with sufficient precision for inclusion in a convention.4. Alternatives to the 4C hour week ^Paragraph.JL6\jotQuestionnaire^.The Air Ministry consider that a 42 hour week would avoid the necessity of revising the hours of non-industrial staff in11.
industrial establishments now conditioned to a 42 hour week.5*       The Problem of Continuous Work (Paragraph 17 (a) ofQuestionnaire).The Service Departments, who are principally concerned,consider that a minimum 42 hour week should be allowed forcontinuous work;    a 48 hour week would be required in certainWar Department Establishments.6. Exceptions  (Section E of Questionnaire).For the most part. Departments contemplate meeting the problems described in Section E of the Questionnaire by recourse to over-time.     Limitation of the amount -of overtime is not favoured.Ngte: 1.    The percentage of the deficiency in man-hours arising from the introduction of a 40 hour week which would be made up by the engagement of extra labour in the various Departments is as follows:-Admiralty 70Ordnance Factories 77 Other War DepartmentEstablishments 83Air Ministry 51Office of Works 84Stationery Office 75Post Office 98Except in the case of the Admiralty, where it is anticipated that the balance  (30%) of the deficiency in man-hours will be made up entirely by overtime,  the Departments expect that the shorter working week will to some extent improve the average output per man-hour.Note:_2.    In the financial estimates submitted, under which the costs of the existing output are estimated to be increased by  3,250,00^ or ^357,000 per annum respectively according as hourly rates and piece-work prices are increased in proportion to the reduction of hours or maintained at existing levels,  no account is taken of increased costs of material etc.,  that would result from the introduction of a 40 hour week in industry generally. Note: 5.    In the foregoing estimates of increased costs that would arise from the introduction of a 40 hour week in
Government Industrial Establishments no account has been taken of the effect on Post Office Manipulative Staffs.      It is estimated that,  on the reduction of the working week of these staffs from 48 gross to 40 net the increased costs would be(l) On basis of the maintenance ofexisting wages  2,000,000 per annum(2) On basis of a pro ratareduction of wages Negligible.A reduction to a gross working week of 40 hours would however involve increased costs of  5,000,000 per annum and  170,000 per annum under assumptions (l) and (2)  respectively.H.Q. 238-80 B.D.
EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OR THE 10th MASTING OF &quot;THE CABINET COMMITTEE ON TRADE AND p EMPLOYMENT, HELD ON FE.l3R.UARY&quot; YthT 1934.Spreading of     4o      The Committee had under consideration a Work.memorandum hy the Minister of Labour (T.E.C. (32) 3l)The 40-hour week. giving an account of the history and presentposition of the discussions,  in the International Labour Office and elsewhere,   regarding the proposal for a universal 40-hour week in all industries and in all countries.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR explained to  the Committee that the upshot of his consideration of this matter as contained in the memorandum was that the proposal to apply a 40-hour week generally to all industries was hopelessly impracticable.    He saw no reason, however, why the question should not be examined on a more detailed basis with particular reference to the conditions obtaining in individual industries.    He himself was proceeding on these lines,  and he had some time ago asked the Con-federation of Employers&apos; Organisations for a report on this basis which he had now received.    This report was in some respects disappointing and he had asked the Confederation for further information.Proceeding,  the Minister of Labour called attention to the information contained in para-graph 4 of his memorandum which shewed that  the effect of introducing a 40-hour week for industrial employees in Government establishments (assuming that the present weekly wages were maintained for the reduced hours) would be to impose an additional charge of just under    3-? million on the Exchequer, while the total number of additional employees who    could be absorbed wouldnot exceed  15,000.    This furnished a valuable-5-
indication of the cost of such proposals and the results tnat might he expected in the way of additional employment.The proposal to apply a 40-hour week generally seemed to him to he based on the supposition that conditions in all industries were the same. In fact,  the effect on industries which were dependent on their export trade and so were subject to world competition would be entirely different from the effect on industries which enjoyed a safe home market. While,  therefore,he thought that the proposal was entirely fantast-ic as applied to industry as a whole, he repeated that there were not the  same objections to examining it from the point of view of individual industries. He thought, however,  that it was absolutely essential that the effect upon any particular industry should be made quite clear,  and he was therefore approaching the representatives of industries trade by trade with a view to seeing whether in any particular industries anything on these lines was possible,  and if so what  the cost would be.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS expressed the view that nothing was so likely to give  rise to industrial  trouble as to allow it to be known that the Government was considering this proposal seriously,       A 40-hour week was not perhaps impracticable, but in advocating this proposal the Trade Unions had in mind that the same earnings v/ould be obtained as for the present longer week.       The answer to that was provided by the export trade $    any hope of recovery in that trade would be destroyed.If tMs matter was discussed seriously with
representatives of employers and of the Trades Union Congress&apos;he was afraid that it would result in diminishing the confidence of employers while it might create an artificial agitation on the part of the Trade Unions in favour of the resolution which had been passed on this subject at the last Congress,In his view the proposition was ridiculous.    On the railways a 40-hour week would mean that there would be less than 50 hours actual work performed every week.    In the case of Government establishments any additional staff that was taken on would, he thought, be unnecessary staff.    But quite apart from its merits the most serious danger lay in the uncertainty that would be aroused if it was thought that the Government were treating as serious a proposal which, he believed, would be quite disastrous for industry.THE CHANCELLOR OE THE EXCHEQUER agreed generally with the views expressed, by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. There was no logical basis for a 40-hour week or a week of any other number of hours.    The proposal was largely a matter of politics.Nevertheless, he was impressed with the fact that one of the causes of the intractability of our unemployment was the contin-ual application of new scientific discoveries to industry and the consequent saving of manual labour resulting in increased unemployment.      It was said that this matter would adjust itself in time, but there was always a lag, and he could not see when this lag would be overtaken,  as the mechanisation of industry was a continuous process.      It was, therefore, natural to  ask both on grounds of humanity and of ethics whether there was any possibility of sharing the available work in wrder that we might avoid the present position under which some people were continuously at work and some people more or less continuously out of work.It was clear that  there were great practical difficulties,especially in regard to the particular proposal for shorteningthe weekly hours of work.    Eor example, if the effect was tokeep plant idle which would otherwise be working, that would-7-
add to  the overhead, costs in adaiticn to the extra wages-costs involved in paying the same wages for a shorter week&apos;s work.    In the same way, a firm which was already employing the whole of its plant could, only take on new workers for the purpose of working a shorter week by purchasing additional plant, with the result that both the eld and the new plant would be idle for some part of the week - thus edding to the difficulties of organisation and of costs.      It seemed clear, therefore, that the  shortening of tho working week was neither a practicable nor a desirable way of attaining the proposal to share out available work.he would, however,  suggest that the Minister of Labour might take into consideration the possibility of discussing with various industries the question of employing men on rotation.      He noticed that in certain establishments, mainly in the coal mining industry, men were being employed for three weeks out of four in rotation and drawing unemployment benefit during the week in which they &quot;played&quot;.      It seemed to him that this plan was not open to the same objections as the proposal for saving hours (fox&apos; example the difficulty of keeping plant idle would not arise).      It was true  chat the difficulty regarding the amount of earnings to be pro-vided for a shorter period of work remained.    In general he felt that the whole question was one which could not be settled by Government but only by the representatives of individual industries.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS stated that the difficulty regarding the additional expense involved in Keeping plant  idle could be got over if it was agreed to work more than the one shift per day, but the Trade Unions were entirely opposed to that suggestion.He went on to say that sharing of work schemes always gave rise to difficulties, and instanced the case of the coal trimmers in South Vales who had arrangements under
which for a period the whole body of trimmers pooled both their wages    and their unemployment benefit.    The result was that the Unemployment Fund was actually paying men who were on holiday and considerable difficulties had arisen.     He himself had approached t] railway companies with a view to the introduction of a five-day week as an alternative to the dismissal of workers,, but, although the companies   were agreeable, the Unions would only consent provided that the same wages were given for a five-day week as had previously been drawn for a six-day week.      The result was that the Unions were now paying large sums in unemployment benefit to men who otherwise would be employed.SIS HORACE WILSON suggested that one indirect result of schemes of spreading of work was either to put up costs or to give rise to trade disputes. He recalled that Lord Weir had made the point that a general reduction of hours would put up costs in the sheltered trades and this would react disastrously on the industries which depended upon their export trade.THE POSTMASTER GENERAL stated that the same problem arose in connection with the postal workers from whom he was receiving a deputation on this very subject within the next few days.      To carry out the proposal for all Post Office workers would cost many millions.      The cost of applying it to the industrial staff alone would cost  1,000,000 a year and the additional employment provided would net amount to more than 5,000 persons.      He had to tell the deputation that this was a proposal which could not be contemplated.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR explained that in his talks with representatives of industry he had men-tioned the suggestion for rotation of employment, which had been raised by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer;    he had only recently written to representatives of the- steel industry on this subject.      a good deal of work-sharing was already being done voluntarily.      There was a scheme which applied to the Shale mining industry as a whole, and a number of colliery undertakings had also adopted work-sharing schemes.      He was clear that it was not possible to impose such schemes compulsorily, although he thought that they might be encouraged.      At the moment he felt that there was no further step which he could take in this matter.      He was anxious to ascertain the facts in connection with particular industries and until that was done he would not be willing to see any further step taken in connection with the reduction of hours.In conclusion the Minister of Labour drew attention to certain proposals which Lord Trent had made in Birmingham on the previous day which might be summarised as follows:-(a) Each industry and establishment should be respon-sible for its own unemployed.(b) Hours of work of each individual should be reduced so as to distribute the total hours worked amonga larger number.(c) As an experiment, in certain selected firms, hours of work should be reduced, and. additional work-people taken on proportionate to the reductionin hours.      The State would undertake to pay a substantial proportion (say two thirds)  of the unemployment pay saved on every extra worker taken on over a period of six months or a year.(d) In retail businesses there should be a compulsory month&apos;s holiday with pay every year for all employees. The last proposal   was quite clearly one whichcould not be applied generally since, while it might suit some establishments, it would put others right out of business.    He thought that this was typical of the kind of irresponsible contribution to the solution of the problem under consideration which was made by men in responsible positions. -10-
