Drummond to Sir John Simon. (Received December 28.)       . - : (No. 982.)Sir, Rome, December 19, 1933..I HAVE the honour to inform you that I went to see Signor Suvich this evening in order, nominally, to inform him of your projected visit to Capri. I ventured to tell him in this connexion that I thought it likely, though nothing was yet definitely arranged, that you would come to Rome at the beginning of the new year in order to pay your respects to the head of the Government. Signor Suvich said that he was most glad to learn that you would probably visit Rome. He considered it of the highest importance that you should have an exchange of views with Signor Mussolini. The situation as regards disarmament was becoming very serious and urgent. He saw no possibility of the French and the Germans reaching an agreement if left alone. The German Government had gradually increased their demands, while the French Government had not budged from their original position. At present the former were abiding by the proposals they had made to Sir Eric Phipps, since they still hoped for agreement on such a basis, but once they were convinced that no agreement could be reached, then they would certainly begin rapidly to rearm. Though he did not think they had as yet gone very far in this direction, they were, in fact, already becoming somewhat impatient. It was for these reasons that he attached so much importance to your visit, and he trusted that you would be prepared to remain in Rome at least two, and even better, three days.2. Signor Suvich then told me in detail of the conversations which he had had with the German Chancellor regarding disarmament. He prefaced these remarks by saying that he believed that Hitler was absolutely sincere and that he was the dominant force in the Government. It was true that he did not go into detail in the same way as did Signor Mussolini, and therefore on detail sometimes he might not be accurate; but the general lines of policy were determined by him and what he said was decisive. The Chancellor had given him verbally the information which he had already conveyed to Sir Eric Phipps. Signor Suvich had remarked that he considered the number of 300,000 men excessive, but the Chancellor insisted that he could not take less because the figui&apos;e of 300,000 put him vis-a-vis France in a worse position than he would have been under the original British draft convention. France had to-day over 600,000 men, while he was only asking for 300,000. Signor Suvich enquired whether the Chancellor could not be satisfied as regards material with smaller amounts, increasing by stages as time went on. This would calm French fears to some extent. The Chancellor replied that this was impossible. He could not agree to stages, because he would be replacing the Reichswehr by a short-term army of 300,000 men, and it was necessary that they should receive proper training. Secondly, it was much easier and cheaper to manufacture all these arms at one time. And, lastly, he could not give way on this point for reasons of prestige, for the honour of the nation demanded such a measure of defensive rearmament. As to the S.S. and S.A., he repeated to Signor Suvich what he had already said to Sir Eric Phipps in regard to these organisations.3. I asked Signor Suvich whether he thought that the Germans would be prepared to bargain about these figures. -He shook his head, and said that they might be prepared to give way a little, but a very little. The figures and ideas emanated from the Chancellor himself, and he did not think there was much chance of the proposals being diminished. At the same time, there was one question to which he gathered that the Chancellor and the German Government attached great importance, and if this was satisfactorily settled concessions were more likely to be made on armaments matters. He referred to the Saar. He said that the Chancellor was looking for some victory of prestige in foreign affairs.[995 ee-2]
2He had not obtained this as regards Austria. If, however, he could say that he had; secured the: return of the Saar territory to Germany two years before the plebiscite, this would, be&quot; a signal success. (Of course, it&quot; may&apos; be&quot;&apos; that&quot; Signor Suvich laid SO much stress on the Saar problem because he thought that if the Chancellor succeeded here Nazi pressure on Austria would diminish:) -When he was speaking of the Saar, I said to him that, to the best of my recollection, in the negotiations of 1929-30 between Germany and France all questions relating &quot;-to the Saar were to have been discussed, and that if a settlement had been reached the plebiscite would have been abandoned. I was therefore somewhat astonished to see the instructions which the French Government had given to their Ambassador in Berlin on this subject. My general impression is that Signor SuviCh considers the Saar to be the best card which France now holds in regard to an immediate arrangement with Germany.4. Signor Suvich. said that he had discussed the question of League.,of Nations reform with Herr von Neurath and Herr von bulow. Neither the Chancellor nor General Goring had shown any interest in the subject. The German Foreign Office had said that they agreed generally with the criticisms which had been put forward in Italy concerning the League, but that they would not return to an institution in which they found themselves so completely isolated as had recently been the case at Geneva. Germany was much happier in. the presence of other Great Powers than in that of a number of small States.5. I observed that Germany, when she entered the League, had the sympathy of many small States, such as the Scandinavian countries, Holland and Switzerland. If she had pursued a different policy she certainly would not have been isolated. Signor Suvich remarked that this was perfectly true, and that it was Germany that had brought isolation on herself, and the League could not be blamed for it.(5. He had then broached the question of Austria with the Chancellor. Herr Hitler stated that he did not desire the &quot; Anschluss,&quot; but that he could not approve of an anti-German policy in Austria. To this Signor Suvich replied that he believed Dr. Dollfuss to be thoroughly Germanic, but that as an Austrian, patriot he could not allow the independence of Austria to be threatened. Signor Suvich did not think that he had made much impression on the Chancellor, although the latter listened carefully to what he said. He told me that he would shortly be going to Vienna to return Dr. Dollfuss&apos;s visit to Rome.&apos; Dr. Dollfuss had let it be known that his visit to Berlin without a further visit to Vienna would be misunderstood by and discourage the Austrian people. Signor Suvich thought it most important that everything should be done to encourage Dr. Dollfuss, and that we should all talk as if we were certain that he would be successful in his struggle to preserve Austrian independence. He himself thought he would succeed.&apos; 7. He again reverted, as I left, to the immense importance he attached to the conversations which he hoped you would have with Signor Mussolini.8.
