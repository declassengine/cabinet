(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)..COPY NO.   4? .SECRETCP. 9 (34).CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation by the Government of India, dated 15th January 1934.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political situation in India dated 15th January 1934 issued on the authority of the Secretary 6f State for India.The demand for a meeting of the All-India Congress Committee has been dropped for the present.   This is the result.lt of a statement of the Government1s policy referred to in paragraph two of the last appreciation, combined with the continued opposition of Mr. Gandhi and Pandit Jawahar Lai Nehru to such a meeting.. Mr. Gandhi has been continuing his tour in Madras Presidency and the general appreciation of its results there is very similar to that given regarding his tour in the central provinces. large crowds have collected, attracted moreby curiosity and by personal veneration in which Mr. Gandhi continues to be held, than by enthusiasm for the cause he represents. . .His monetary collections appear to be fairly large, but not to have come up to his expectation.   As in the Central Provinces, considerable doubts are felt about the destination of funds which he. has. collected, and it is thought not unlikely that less scrupulous of local leaders may apply such funds as they receive to objects other than uplift of untouchables and, in particular, to the revival of Civil Disobedience activities. It is observed that, in Madras, Gandhi has been cautious about being drawn into discussions on the vexed question of Temple entry, and prefers to deliver speeches on the general aspects of Harijan uplifting.In Bengal the terrorist situation, as explained in an earlier appreciation, is under control and important results have been achieved.   But the end is still distant.    In spite of the very successful activities that have been pursued by the police and troops in the Chittagong area, a serious outrage&apos; was
attempted there a few days ago and, though the attempt met with no success and all four of the perpetrators were either killed or captured on the spot, it is clear that the organisation there, for all its losses, is still active and enterprising.     In the province generally, improved intelligence system has served to show that the movement has wider ramification than was believed a year ago and active recruitment still continues.    Government have therefore fresh legislation under consideration, designed particularly to strengthen their hand in checking fresh recruitment.At the recent All-India Trades Union Conference, held during Christmas week at Cawnpore, many of the speeches were strongly flavoured with c ommunism.    It is true that such a conference does not represent more than a very small .. percentage of the total industrial population, but the views put forward at the Conference show that the communist peril is a real one.
