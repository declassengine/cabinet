CONFIDENTIAL. A.C. 884.BOARD OP TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL. STATE OP TRADE - NOVEMBER. 1955.Summary of Reports submitted lay members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in..some oases with information from other sources) *Employment.     The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at 20th November, was 2,280,817, a decrease of 18,756 compared with 23rd October. The number wholly unemployed, including casuals, decreased by 1,202 and the number temporarily stopped, by 17,534,   The changes between 23rd October and 20th November in the different divisions were London 4- 13, South-Eastern + 5,864, South Western 4- 457, Midlands - 15,461, North-Eastern - 7,113, North-Western - 2,962, Scotland + 8,046, Fales - 7,580.The estimated number of insured persons in employment at 20th November, was 9,956,000, being 31,000 more than a month before and 597,000 more than a year beforeThe improvement previously noted was continued in coal mining, engineering, ship-building and ship repairing, vehicle building, miscellaneous metal goods manufacture, the cotton, carpet, pottory and glass industries, woodworking and furniture making.    There was also an improvement in iron and steel, tin plate, silk and artificial silk manufacture and in the distribu-tive trades.    The seasonal decline in building, public works contracting, hotel and transport servioes, and hat and cap manufacture continued and there was some setback in tailoring and dressmaking.Overseas Trade.    Imports in November, 1935, werd  63,734,000 compared with  61,516,000 in November, 1932, while exports were  34,455,000 compared with  31,094,000.   Exports
imported merchandise were  3,619,000 compared with  4,060,000* Transhipments under bond amounted to  2,005,000 compared with  2,307,000.Rail and Rq&amp;d. Traffic,    inuring the five weeks ended 3rd December, 1933, the railway traffic receipts were  572,000 (4.37$;) more than in the corresponding period of 3 932;    tine increase was mainly due to merchandise, minerals and Livestock.The number of passengers (other than season-ticket holders.) conveyed by all standard gauge railways in Great Britain, other than those of the London Passenger Transport Board, and the T/hitechapel and Bow joint railway, was 6,536,008 more in September, 1933, than in the corresponding period of 1932.The number of motor vehicles, other than motor cycles, newly registered in October, llJ33, was 778 (4.4-i) more than in the corresponding period of 1932*    This figure comprises an increase of 1,300 in commercial vehicles and a decrease of 522 in private cars.   Motor cycle registrations showed a decrease of 296 (11$).F?nance and banking.    (a) ^onflon.    Honey continued reasonably easy and a small number of capital issues were successfully floated.    Discount rates showed a further slight advance, and at the end of the month lj-j per annum was the cleaving banks&apos; buying rate for the longer maturities^The erratic behaviour of the foreign exchanges during November, has affected both the security and commodity markets. The dollar, under the influence of the daily increases in the official price for gold In America, fell from 4.80 at the beginning of the month to 5.52 on the 16th, when a rally set in which brought it baok to 5.10 in the early days of December. This sharp reaction was probably due to the existence of a very large &quot;bear&quot; position in dollars.    The franc has also displayed weakness and fell steadily from 80 at the beginning of November to about 84.50 at the end of the month.    Gilt-edged stocks showed some weakness as a result of the uneasiness induced by the sharp fall of the dollar.
(b) France. The Sarraut Government, defeated on its Budget proposals, was succeeded by the Chautenps Government almost identical in composition.    This Government has since managed to pass the Budget through the Chamber.    The Treasury position is again causing alarm, and available information suggests that unless the Budget is soon balanced there may be some difficulty in raising funds for current requirements. This difficulty has been increased by the recent rise in money rates in Paris, due to the repayment of the 3rltish bankers&apos; credit and to the contraction of credit with which the Bank of France is meeting its heavy gold losses.(c) Germany.    The improvement in conditions in the financial markets continued steadily during November.    The Reichbank&apos;s gold and foreign exchange holdings show an increase of over RM. 130 millions since June and now amounts to canada. 408 millions.    Part of this increase is attributable to the repatriation of holdings of German nationals abroad. In recent weeks the payment of interest on the   Youngloan and on oertain other credits has led to an efflux of about . RM.10 millions in spite of the satisfactory export surpluses for September and October, amounting to almost Rii.100 millions in eaoh month.    It is understood that a considerable volume of exports is being paid for not in foreign exchange but out of Konversionskasse scrip and blocked Reichsmark balances.      The public works programme involving a total expenditure over a period of years of over RM.8 milliards is already beginning to make itself felt in a rise in the price level.    This is being met by somewhat restricting oredit facilities to private borrowers in order to counteract the effect of the financing of public works.    It is probable, however,  that the adverse effect of the rising internal price level on the exporting capacity of Germany will be obscured, at any rate
- ... itemporarily, by the ability of exporters to acquire Konversionskasse scrip and blocked Reichsmark balances at a large discount.U.3.A. Though there is little concrete evidence of any change in President Roosevelt1s monetary policy, the violent movements in the dollar rate show that opinion regarding the future of the dollar has vacillated considerably during the month.    Economic conditions show little change.   Business activity is still declining,  though more slowly, but both wholesale and retail business has increased somewhat, and steel production has risen slightly.    Exports in October at / 194 millions are the highest for any month since October, 1951, but in the absence of detailed figures it is impossible to say which classes of goods are responsible for the marked improvement.The fall in the dollar, which started at the end of October, with the announcement of the gold buying policy, continued till the middle of November, under the influence of almost daily rises in the U.S. Treasury price for gold.    These gold price increases were interpreted as inflationary and this interpretation of the Government&apos;s policy was reinforced by certain changes in personnel.    There were later developments, however, which gave rise to the hope, if not of an early stabilisation, at least of a toning down of the drive to depreciate the dollar.    There has been a growing volume of criticism by the advocates of &quot;sound money&quot;,    though it must be -remembered that it is difficult for them to make their case to the public against the promises of the inflationists.    Moreover,  to the popular mind the &quot;sound money&quot; school is associated with the much discredited Wall Street.    It should be noted, however, that U.S. bonds have developed some weakness since the new gold buying policy was announced, and that it is essential that the market in these bonds should be kept -good unless the Administration proposes issuing notes to finance its extensive public works programme and its Budget deficit which, although at a lower level than last year, is running
at the rate of over J&amp;LOO millions a month.    It has been said that the stop in the rise of the official gold price in the middle of November, which led to the rally of the dollar, was prompted by the desire toreasssure the bond market.   One factor which contributed to the weakness of the market may possibly have been the decision of the Federal Reserve System temporarily to stop its purchases of Government securities, the reason given being that the purchases made so far are sufficient to meet any desired increases in credit.Coal. The output of coal for the period January 1st to November 25th, was 188,984,500 tons as compared with 191,095,500 tons in the same period of 1932.    In each of the five weeks ending November 25th, however, the output was greater than in the corresponding week of 1932.The number of persons employed on the 25th November, 1933, was 770,300, compared with 775,700 in 1932, and the weekly output per person was 5.80 tons compared with 5.60 tons.Exports of coal during November amounted to 3,607,094 tons compared with 3,591,156 tons in November, 1952.   Among the countries to which our exports have increased may be mentioned Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Belgium,  Spain, Portugal and the Argentine Republic.    Shipments for bunkers were 1,169,769 tons compared with 1,168,701 tons.In the North-East Coast area the demand in Northumberland is now good, and in the Durham market there has been a slight improvement.    In Scotland, the export market remains firm. There has been no change in the position in South Wales and it is said that the advantage gained by other districts in the export trade has caused greater competition from Germany and Polish sources in markets which previously belonged to South Wales.    The demand for house coal from the Midland districts has improved.
hi hiAllocations of output for the first quarter of 1934 have been fixed at H^fi above the actual output of the first quarter of 1933.Iron and Steel.    The output of pig iron in November, 1933, was 374,900 tons, and of steel ingots and castings 695,000, compared with 267,700 tons and 473,800 tons respectively, in November, 1932.    The general improvement of previous months was maintained during November, although some seasonal falling off is usual at this time of the year.    The domestic demand continues to improve, and the increased orders placed by the railways and shipbuilding yards are an encouraging feature. Export trade, however, shows little change and is hampered by exchange restrictions, tariffs and quota systems.   The demand for pig iron has increased, and stocks are falling.   Most of the producers of semi-finished material are also well occupied, and in some cases are behindhand with deliveries.Conditions in Scotland have improved during the past month, and the shipbuilding orders are stated to be the best of any month since the beginning of the present slump.      On the North East coast activity is particularly noticeable in semi-finished material, and the supply is only just keeping pace with demand.    The output of material for bridge and otherconstructional work has improved recently.    In South Wales the position shows little change.   The demand for tinplate is less satisfactory, and keen competition is being encountered in export markets from American producers who are taking advantage of the depreciation of the dollar.   Recent orders for railway material have benefited the heavy steel producers.    In the Sheffield district the improvement in all types of iron and steel continues.Shipping.    The index number of shipping freights (1913 -100) during November was 80.56 compared with 76.71 in the previous month and 81.67 in November, 1932.
^Electricity. The output of electricity in November, was 1,420 million units compare-:, with 1,230 million units in November, 1932.    The output for the first 11 months of 1933, showed an increase of 9.5.&apos;.?; compared with 1932.    In electrical apparatus manufacture, the position remains   much the same as in October, and the proportion of productive capacity in use is about 60%,    There was little change in the home market but a slight improvement in the export market as regards heavy plant; the home demand for lighter apparatus increased.Building;. Despite the usual seasonal fall in employment, builders in many parts are still busy.   For some orafts the demand at present exceeds supply, owing to the fact that local authorities wish to finish their building schemes by March 31st, 1934, in order to qualify for subsidies.    In one area over-txme and Sunday work are in progress and artificial light is being used to permit late working.   Prices of building materials in general are stable.Chemicals.    Sales of alkali and chlorine products during November, continued to show steady improvement both in the home and export trades.    Deliveries of hydrochloric and sulphuric acids were well maintained and sales of industrial nitrogen products were normal.    Trade in dyestuffs appears to be good although some nervousness is felt as regards India and Japan.Owing to difficulties arising from the depreciation of sterling and of the dollar, the North African producers of phosphate rock&apos;formed in July, 1933, a central selling bureau to control prices.    The bureau has since come to an agreement with American producers regarding export markets and is now in negotiation with the Egyptian and Pacific Ocean producers including the British Phosphate Commission.    It appears, therefore probable that a world phosphate cartel will shortly be in existence which may have reactions on the price charged to consumers in this country.
Machine Tools. The home demand for machine tools has -------------improved recently and it is expected that the new constructional programmes of the railways and shipping companies will stimulate further demand, particularly for the heavier types of tool. The exports of machine tools for November, 1935,  were  102,000 compared with  297,000 in 1932.    Of this,  18,000 went to Russia compared with  247,000 in 193a.    The fall in the dollar has rendered the competitive position of American manufacturers in the Russian market much stronger than in the past.Motor Industry. In the home market progress is satisfactory, &quot;but competition from the United States is now being felt, as a result of.the fall in the dollar.Paper. The improvement noticeable in the earlier part of the year in practically all sections of the paper trade has continued during the past month.   Most paper mills were busier during November than they have been at this season for a number of years. The improved demand has checked the downward trend of prices but has not allowed the price to be increased to an extent comparable with the increased prices of raw material.    Prices of newsprint have continued downwards in all markets.Imports of paper show a definite increase despite the fact that production is on a higher level.    Exports of paper increased during October, owing to the better markets now available in Empire countries, particularly in Australia.Other Industries. The home demand for rubber tyres continues at a high level and shows considerable increase over the previous year.    In the export market competition is very strong.    The home outlook for rubber footwear is good, apart from the uncertainty created by increasing duty-free imports from Singapore;. Dominions markets are also purchasing from that source.    Expert business in general is at a very low ebb, and is mainly in the hands of the Japanese.    Sales of soap during November, were normal.    The consumption of margarine remains low, owing to the
condition of the butter market.    General deliveries of edible oils and fats are slightly in excess of those of last year.Canadian trade. Exports for November, were $69&apos;, 585,000 compared with ,$45,945,000 in November, 1952, while imports were z$24,489,000 compared with   ^25,095,000.The index of wholesale prices declined in October from 68.9 to 67.9 while the index of the physical volume of business fell from 90.8 to 88.2.    On the other hand the index of employment after seasonal adjustment was 88.4 on the 1st November, compared with 86.9 on the 1st October.Australian trade. Imports during October amounted to  6,251,000 oompared with  6,559,000 in October of the previous year.    Exports of wheat for the season were 149,000,000 bushels which was 2,000,000 bushels less than in the previous season. Shipments of butter to the United Kingdom for the period 1st July to 25th November were 22.5% less than last year.    Customs revenue and postal revenue for the five months ended 30th November, showed in each case an improvement on last year and bank clearings for the period January to November were also greater.South African trade. Exports for the 10 months ended October 51st were  77,737,000 (the gold being valued at the market price) compared with  57,389,000 in the corresponding period of 1932.    Imports were  39,5 07,000 compared with  26,944,000.The prolonged drought in the agricultural districts has now broken in nearly all parts.    The effect of the rain is not yet, however, visible in prices and milk, butter and live stock are all fetching temporarily enhanced prices.    The shortage of water is reflected in the reduced estimates of crops,  e.g. wool 225 million lbs. or 20fo less than the previous year, maize 8,541*000 bags compared with 19,034;000 bags, wheat 2,811,000 bags compared with 5,188,000 bags.    The sugar crop, however, is
estimated at 386,000 tons, an increase of 50,000 tons on the previous year.Gold mining activity continues to expand and is reflected in an increase in general industrial activity.    The Exchequer receipts for October exceeded those of October, 1932, in all classes and railway revenue for the 6 weeks ended 18th November showed an increase of 20%.Indian trade. Imports in November, 1933, were 1,001 lakhs of rupees compared with 1,114 in November, 1932, while the corresponding figures for exports were 1,319 and 1,237 lakhs of rupees.   The net export of gold was 246 lakhs of rupees comparer with 657 in November, 1932.    The excess of imports over exports for the month was 562 lakhs of rupees compared with 785 lakhs for the corresponding month in 1932.    The wholesale price index for the month of November was 88 as in the two previous months.    The crop prospects appear on the whole to be favourable.
