Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1934.SECRET. Copy No. 43CP. 60 (34).CABINET.SALE OF ARMSTRONG-SIDDELEY AERO-ENGINES TO GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.I CIRCULATE this note to acquaint my colleagues with my views on the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum on this subject (CP. 59 (34)).I agree with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s presentation of this case, and my own solution of the problem would be to let Sir John Siddeley fill this order of 118 engines, making 200 in all to be delivered to Germany. I should make the further 260 engines conditional upon a much clearer statement of the case later on. After all, 200 engines is not a great number with which to equip three-engined machines : allowing for reserves, it would be sufficient for about forty such machines. I think it would be difficult to say that Germany&apos;s civil aviation could not absorb this number.On the other hand, we have an opportunity of bringing some  200,000 worth of work into the country, and if we hold over the decision on the further prospect of 260 engines till later, we shall see how the Germans actually do use those that are now to be supplied.I would remind my colleagues that the Germans are behindhand in the design of air-cooled engines, and that they could certainly get all they want from America. They have instead chosen to come to this country, and I think it is an opportunity which should not be let slip. I am of opinion that this is a genuine order, and that, although the Germans are prepared to entangle us in an evasion of the Paris Agreement, they do, in fact, want the engines, and are not merely decoying us into a false position. We can call a halt in the supply of engines when we feel that the needs of German civil aviation have been reasonably met.There is another similar point requiring decision. The Germans have asked that a small number of their pilots should be trained at Sir John Siddeley&apos;s school at Hamble. I am in entire agreement with the Foreign Secretary that this should not be allowed in present circumstances.L.Air Ministry, February 24, 1934.[9706]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
