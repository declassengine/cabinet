national Medical Servicc;  correspondence with British Medical Association.Note by Minister of Health.I circulate lor the information of ray colleagues a copy of a letter (Appendix A) from the British Medical Association suggesting that I should call a conference of representative bodies to discuss the problem of a general medical service for the nation.    The main purpose of such a conference would, no doubt, be to consider and discuss the development of public health services on the general lines of proposals published by the Association in the British Medical Journal in April, 1930.    The nature of these proposals can be seen from the annexed outline  (b) .I propose to reply to the Association on the following lines:-&quot;The Minister appreciates  uhe importance of the issues which the Council of the Association have in mind in putting forward this suggestion.   He assumes that the main purpose of the projected conference would be to consider and discuss the development of public health services on the general lines indicated in the.proposals published by the Association in the British Medical Journal in April, 1330, and subsequently discussed at the Annual Representative Meeting.    The Minister does not desire to comment on the merits of those proposals as he thinks that the Council will appreciate that financial conditions would not at present, and may not for some  lime to come, permit the adoption of a scheme of comprehensive health services such as they have in mind, however desirable ouch an end might be in itself.

APPENDIX A.Copy of letter from British Medical Association. Sir,The Council  of this Association has had before it a suggestion that a conference should be called early in 1934 to discuss the problem of a general medical service for the nation, to which selected bodies representative of medical practitioners, hospital authorities, public health authorities, public health officers, national health insurance and others, should be  invited to send representatives.The Council is of opinion that a free discussionof this important question by a body fully representative ofall those who are concerned with the promotion of the health of the nation could not fail to serve a very useful purpose,but it is also of the opinion that if such a conference is held it should preferably be called by the Ministry of health or under its aegis.     There is a widely expressed desire infavour of the holding of such a conference, and the Councilof the Association would be glad if the Ministry could seeits way to take the initiative in calling such a body together.I am,Yours faithfully,G.C.
