THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1934.SECRET. Copy No.    40CP. 7 (34).CABINET.THE SITUATION IN  PALESTINE.Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.ON behalf of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, I circulate for the information of the Cabinet, in continuation of CP. 2 (34), a copy of a Secret despatch received yesterday from Sir Arthur Wauchope on the situation in Palestine.(Initialled)   J. H. T.Downing Street, January 12, 1934.Annex.Secret Despatch from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated January 5, 1934.Palestine. (Secret.) Reference No. CF/431/33.)Sir, January 5, 1934.I HAVE the honour to report that there are indications in the Arabic Press that the Moslem feast at the end of Ramadan, called Eid-al-Fitr, will be made the occasion for political demonstrations and processions.In this connection, I enclose a copy of a communication I have received from Musa Kazem Pasha, Head of the Arab Executive, and my letter in reply to that communication.I have instructed Major Campbell to visit the Pasha, who is now in Jericho, to see if some arrangement can be made with the Arab Executive to prevent illegal demonstrations on the 16th January, or any other date.2. I had a very friendly talk with the Mufti on the 2nd January. I told him that I had informed Musa Kazem Pasha very clearly that I would allow no procession without the permission of Government, and that I would allow no procession to pass within the neighbourhood of Government offices.The Mufti said he fully accepted these two principles, but that he believed that the people merely wished to walk peacefully through the streets of Jerusalem and other towns as a protest against Jewish settlement in Palestine, and that they had no wish to cause disturbances.I said I believed that was true of the people in general, but I was doubtful if it were true of all the leaders and that some of the leaders had made speeches that might well excite people to commit illegal acts.The Mufti remarked that there were many excitable individuals both among the Arabs and the Police, but in order to prevent disturbances he would be willing to select a number of respected people whom he could trust to walk with the crowd on leaving the Mosque on the 16th, and these men would act as a steadying influence on the crowd. On the other hand, he hoped that I would give orders to ensure that the Police should show every forbearance so long as the people remained orderly.[9520]
Chief Secretary,On the 27th December Musa Kazim Pasha-al-Husseini telephoned to me and asked me whether I could call on him at his house. I said yes and complied with his request at. once. I found him in his bed and he started the conversation by telling me that he was going the next day to Jericho and that he wanted that the following message be transmitted to his Excellency :&quot; The Arabs have definitely decided to hold the demonstration on the &apos;Id Day. It was decided that he (Kazem Pasha) should not take part in the demonstration. As a mark of friendship to his. Excellency he wishes that his Excellency should not prevent the people, from making their peace-ful demonstration; if the demonstration is opposed by the Police the demon-strators may resist more than the last time, even if the Police kill half of them ,v and the. situation in the country will become worse. He said that this is not the last demonstration, and that other demonstrations will take place until the Arabs are granted their requests.I replied that His Eminence could be sure of that, but I would make a further request to him that he should give definite instructions to &quot;all preachers in the various Mosques of Palestine not to adopt a merely negative attitude in their sermons on the 16th and on the preceding Friday, but that these preachers should use all their influence by advising the crowd to behave in an Orderly manner.His Eminence promised he would do this.I then quoted to him some inflammatory words reported to have been used by two prominent Waqf officials, whom I named.The Haj replied that these two men were by no means personal friends of his, and,, as a matter of fact, he was now being accused by his opponents of being pro-British in sentiment and of acting under my instructions, but, none the less, he was grateful that I had given him this information regarding these two officials.I then said that Government could not allow any procession, even if it started peacefully from the Mosque, to proceed by the route proposed by the Pasha, and the Mufti at once said that he would use all the influence that he possessed to persuade the leaders to give up this route and to confine the movements of the procession to the cemetery, very close to the Mosque, and a short route which 1 had suggested. He added that he thought there would be more chance of my proposal being accepted if he could induce the Arab Executive to make the suggestion as if it came rather from them than as an order from me.I said that Major Campbell, the District Commissioner, would be in touch with the Arab Executive, and I should be very glad if His Eminence could induce the Arab Executive to make this plan on their own suggestion.The Mufti said he thought he could persuade them, but, personally,! have the gravest doubts if anyone can now induce the Arab Executive to listen to moderate counsels. I emphasized the strong feeling that would be roused in England if an Arab crowd were to cause the death of British police or British soldiers, and how such feelings, if once excited in England, would adversely affect Arab interests and would make the adoption of a liberal policy in Palestine all the more difficult.3. It is hard to see clearly into the mind of any Arab, especially such an acute mind as His Eminence possesses. I am confident that the Mufti likes me, respects me, and is anxious to help me; how far he is sincere in his promise to be of active assistance to the Government is a more difficult problem. He realizes the folly of unlawful demonstrations and clashes with authority, but he fears that the criticisms of his many opponents that he is too pro-British may weaken his influence in the country. The fact, however, that his influence is on the side of moderation is of definite value; were it contrariwise, I consider widespread disturbances would be inevitable.I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. G. WAUCHOPE,High Commissioner for Palestine.The Bight Hon.Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, G.B.E., M.P., &amp;c,        &amp;c, &amp;c,His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies.
diuit -n   &quot;He expressed the opinion that the prosecution of leaders was super-i-  .&apos;. fluotts and only caused the people to be irritated. .m:?       r &quot;Hesaid that;there are people such as Haj Amin Eff. Al Husseini, with.;.     whom his Excellency can discuss these matters.. ;. V He asked that his Excellency should do something with a view to re-establishing the confidence of the people and to put an end to their fears .regarding their future. , ..   ,,, , .- .&quot; As regards the demonstrations, every town will make its own arrange-ments, but they will be peaceful everywhere.&quot;On enquiring from him about the arrangements regarding the demonstration at Jerusalem, he informed me that nothing has finally been decided, but that he discussed the matter with a secretary of the Arab Executive, and he thinks that the people will assemble in the morning at the Mosque for the &apos;Id prayer. After prayers the demonstrators will leave the Mosque and visit the two cemeteries at St. Stephen&apos;s Gate, from there they will visit the Herod&apos;s Gate Cemetery, where they may take their resolutions, and from this cemetery they will go to the Damascus Gate to the Old City where they will disperse. The resolutions taken in the cemetery will be transmitted to Government by a special delegation. He reiterated that if the demonstrators are not interfered with, no incident what so-ever would occur.&apos;&apos; The route to be followed by the demonstrators is being entirely within purely Arab quarters.&quot; He again asked me to invite his Excellency&apos;s attention to the fact that this is not the last demonstration, but that other demonstrations will be held until the Arabs obtain their demands.&quot;(Signed) RUHI ABDULHADI.December 29, 1933.(Private and Personal.)My Dear Pasha, January 2, 1934.I AM grateful to you for your oral message, which was duly delivered to me by Ruhi Bey. I note that it is the intention to organize processions in Jerusalem and elsewhere on the Feast of Bairam. I have no doubt that the promoters of the proposed procession in Jerusalem will make formal application in accordance with the law to the District Commissioner, who will inform them whether a licence may be granted and, if so, subject to what conditions. The same procedure should, of course, be followed by the organizers of the processions which you inform me that it is proposed to arrange in other towns in Palestine.I confidently look to you to use your influence to ensure that the requirements of the law are in each case observed. It is not enough to. propose peaceful intentions and then to contravene the clear stipulations of the law. In view of your illness, of which I was most sorry to learn from Ruhi Bey, I have asked Major Campbell to visit you in order that you may have an opportunity to discuss the matter frankly with him. In the meantime, however, I should wish you to know that I cannot permit any procession to pass by the Government Offices in Jerusalem. Your long administrative experience will tell you that this prohibition is as necessary to-day as it was felt necessary during the Turkish regime.I note your statement that the Arabs propose to hold further demonstrations after Bairam and to continue to do so until their requests are granted. I ant confident that you and other leaders will do nothing to countenance any demonstration for which Government sanction has not first been received. Any such demonstrations are certain to lead to disorder and suffering, and can only discourage the British Government from pursuing the liberal policy which they have in contemplation.You and others leaders are well aware that Government, while always ready to listen to reason, will concede nothing to disorder or illegal acts;indeed, such acts make it only more difficult for Government to pursue a liberal policy.Hoping that the change to Jericho will be of great benefit to your good health. - - 1 &apos;&quot; &quot; &apos;   -Yours very sincerely, (Signed)        A. G: WAIJCHOPE.
