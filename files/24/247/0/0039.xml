&quot;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.&quot;&quot;&quot; : 4 rifliCRST. COPY NO. &quot;S. P. 39(34)CABINET.CONCESSIONS TO AUSTRIA. Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.Baron Franckenstein approached me this morning.     He told me that Dr.  Schtiller must return to Vienna this evening, and he thought it essential that Dr. Schtiller should be able to tell Dr. Dollfuss our general attitude in regard to the proposals which were submitted to me the other day and which were reported to the Cabinet in my memorandum CP. 35.This afternoon, 1 received Baron Pranckenstein and Dr. Schtiller.      They explained to me that they could not carry their proposals further without knowing whether the British Government were prepared in principle to examine those proposals sympathetically.I repeated my assurance that, for a limited period at all events, we were prepared not to assert our most-favoured-nation rights in respect of preferential ooncessions given to Austria by her neighbours.      I explained that, as the Austrian Minister knew, the United Kingdom was always reluctant to give up her definite rights; nevertheless, for Austria, and for Austria alone, we were prepared to make this concession.      I added that we were ready to consider sympathetically the adoption of a similar attitude in regard to concessions by other European countries which were not neighbours in the strict sense.      In particular we would raise no objection to the arrangements which they hoped to make with Prance for preferential treatment of Austrian timber.In the light of the Cabinet discussion, I went tyn to tell them that, much as we sympathised with Austria and anxious as we were to help her in her economic difficulties, my colleagues
and I agreed that it would he impossible to ask Parliament- to grant preferences to Austrian manufacturers.I gathered from their attitude that neither .oaron Franckenstein nor Dr.  Schtlller was really surprised at the decision in regard to preference for Austrian goods.      They thanked me for their reception and for the consideration which had been given to their proposals.W.R.Board of Trade.8th February, 1934.
