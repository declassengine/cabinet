(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 01? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY13 GOVERNMENT )COPY NO.     itoSECRETCP.  44 ( 54 )CABINET india appreciation of the Political Situation by the Government of India, dated 15th February 1934.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
CONE IDENTIAL APPRECIATION OP THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN INDIA dated 15th February 19 34ISSUED ON THE AUTHORITY OP THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA.The outstanding event of January, 19 34, was the earthquake which occurred on 15th January.      The total death roll, as at present ascertained, is nearly 7000.    The full extent of the damage to property cannot even now be accurately estimated;    damage to  cultivated land by deposits of sand and alterations of the water level in an area in which the density of a purely agricultural population in some tracts is over 900 to the square mile may prove to be as serious as, if not more serious, than the wholesale destruction of houses in the towns.    The disaster has had effect of diverting attention from political questions and it is satisfactory that, in Bihar itself,  it has resulted in an improvement of feeling in local circles.Babu Rajendra Prasad, the local Congress leader, recently released from jail, has inaugurated a relief fund to which large subscriptions have already been given and has offered to assist and co-operate with other relief organisations both official and non-official.      Some Congress newspapers,  especially in Bombay, have, however, endeavoured to make political capital out of the disaster by alleging that the Government of Bihar and Orissa and its officers were slow to take immediate steps to meet the distress, but this charge, which was also put forward by Pandit Jawahar Lai Nehru after he had visited the area, has been repudiated by the public of Bihar who have expressed their appreciation of the action taken by the Government and of the way in which hardly tried local officers, most of whom were completely cut off from the outer world, set about their work.
That Jawahar Lai Nehru should adopt this attitude is not surprising for his recent speeches show that he loses no opportunity of stirring up feeling against the Government.    In a carefully guarded speech at Allahabad, on Independence Day (26th January) he attacked the Government of Bengal for their action taken against terrorism in the districts of Midnapore and Chittagong. In Calcutta he also delivered three highly objectionable speeches, and the Government of Bengal have sanctioned his prosecution for sedition.   While in Calcutta, although he condemned individual acts of terrorism, he appears to have made no secret of his predilection for direct action by the masses.Mr. Gandhi&apos;s tour continues in Madras and reports corroborate appreciation previously given;    when he is in a district large crowds collect, but do not evince any particular enthusiasm, while after he leaves there are signs of reaction and disillusionment;    he appears to be doubtful whether to take any active part in relief of sufferers from the earthquake;    that he is obsessed with the question of untouchability is shown by the fact that he attributes the earthquake to this evil.The Bill introduced by Bengal Government for dealing with terrorism, which aims in particular at rendering more difficult the enlisting of recruits by terrorist agents and preventing terrorist mentality, has been referred to a Select Committee by a large majority. The Legislative Assembly has also, by a large majority, referred to a Select Committee the Princes&apos; Protection Bill which is designed to prevent seditious agitation and subversive movements against administration of the States being carried on in British India.
