(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)E  C R E T ..P.$(34)CABINETIMMIGRATION    FROM    THE    IRISH    FREE    STATECopy NoAND    OTHER    DOMINIONS.Note    &quot;by    the    Home    Secretary.1  circulate herewith a memorandum on the subject of immigration from the  Irish Free State and other Dominions which,   in pursuance of Conclusion 5  (b) of Cabinet 61(33), I have prepared in consultation with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,  the  Secretary of State for Scotland,  the Minister of Health and the Minister of Labour.J . G .HOME  OFFICE:10th January,   1934
IMMIGRATION PROM THE IRISH FREE STATE AND OTHER DOMINIONS .Population.1.      In 1931,   there were in England and Wales, 380,000 Irish-born persons,  of whom about 300,000 had been born in the Irish Free State.     No information is available as to the period of their residence in this  country.      In the same year,  there were 123,000 Irish-born persons in Scotland, of whom 55,000 had been born in the Irish Free State.     About 5,500 of those born in the Free State had resided in Scotland for less than 5 years and about 10,300 for less  than 10 years.2.      The percentage of Irish-born persons to the total population of &quot;Rnecland and Wales is 1 per cent .      The figure for Scotland is higher (2.57 per cent.) but there has    been a continuous decline since 1851 when it stood at 6.66 per cent.      In 1921 tne figure was 3.26 per cent.3 .     There has been a corresponding decline in the number of Irish immigrants into Scotland, which fifteen years ago was about 3,000 a year and is now about 2,000 a year - of whom rather more than 1,150 are from the Free State.4 .     Figures relating to persons  of Irish descent in this  country are not available, but there is no doubt that the population of Irish extraction in Scotland has grown considerably at a time when the rest of the population has declined.      The average enrolment at Roman Catholic schools in Scotland (which are mainly recruited from persons  of Irish descent)  rose progressively from 71,293 in 1901-2 to 132,289 in 1931-32, while the average enrolment  of other schools in Scotland fell from 713,662 in 1901-2 to 704,099 in 1931-32 .
In Northern Ireland,  unemployment benefit is only payable after three years&apos;  residence in the United Kingdom.      The Minister has power to allow exceptions.The Free State has just passed a measure limiting the appli-cation of its unemployment assistance scheme to Free State nationals.      For the purpose of this provision the following are to be Free State nationals:-(a) persons born in the Free State  or in the area now comprised in the Free State;(b) persons born outside the Free State or the area now comprised in the Froe State whose mother at the time  of their birth was  ordinarily resident in the Free State or such area .(c) persons who at the  relevant time are and for not less  than five  consecutive years immediately preceding that time have been ordinarily resident in the Free State.For contributory pensions in Northern Ireland a minimum of two years&apos;   residence in that country is required.Unemployment Insurance and other Benefits .5.     In regard to unemployment benefit,  transitional benefit, health insurance benefit,  and contributory old age and widows&apos; and orphans&apos;  pensions,  no distinction is made in England and Wales between British subjects and aliens,  or among British subjects according to their place  of domicile.      Healthinsurance contributions paid in the Free State in respect of- -.persons who subsequently become insurably employed in this..   .country count as contributions for benefits here.      There is no corresponding arrangement as regards contributory pensions, for which a minimum qualifying period of two years&apos;   insurance in this country is required.Non-contributory old age pensions are payable only to persons who have been British subjects for 10 years and have resided in the United Kingdom for 12 years out  of the previous 20In Scotland the position is the  same,  except that a recent decision of the Court  of Session has upheld the right of a widow to pension under the Widows&apos;,  Orphans&apos;  and Old Age Contributory Pensions Acts although her husband had not been resident and insured in Great Britain for two years before his death but had for part of that time been resident and insured in the
Irish Free State   (where there is no Pensions Scheme, and where,  therefore,  contributions are paid only in respect of Health Insurance) .c.      The Ministry of Labour is not in a position to supply figures showing the number of persons born in the  Irish Free State or in other Dominions or Colonies, who are  in receipt of unemployment benefit.Public Assistance .7.      Public assistance is given in this  country,  without differentiation,   to all resident destitute persons.8.      In England no data are available on which to frame an accurate estimate of the number of Free State-born persons  in receipt of public assistance.     A special inquiry made at Liverpool in respect of one week in 1930 showed that 925 persons born in the Free State were receiving out-door relief,  being 7 .7 per cent .  of the  total number in receipt of relief,  at a cost representing  27,000 for a full year.      The position of Liverpool is, however,   exceptional and it is believed that the figures for the country as a whole would be very much lower.9.      In Scotland, in the present year,   there are nearly 14,000 Irish-bom rate-aided persons  (including dependants but not including able-bodied poor) .      Of these it is estimated that about 6,200 wore born in the Irish Free State.      The Irish-born population is 2-j- per cant,  of the total population, but it accounts for 7 per cent,   of the paupers in Scotland.10.        Prior to 1922,  persons of Irish birth who became chargeable to the poor rate in Oreat Britain before completing five years&apos;   continuous residence in Great Britain could be repatriated to Ireland.      Since the  Irish Free State ceased to be part of the United Kingdom,  this arrangement no longer applies
to Southern Ireland and remains in force only in respect of Northern Ireland.      Repeated efforts have been made, without success,   to get the Free State to agree to the  conclusion of a reciprocal arrangement by which such persons  could be repatriated compulsorily.11.    When a rate-aided person desires to return to the Dominion or foreign country to which he belongs,  his return can he effected at the  cost of the public assistance authority.      The Free State High Commissioner in London has agreed that, with his  consent, a family may be returned to the Free State where removal is desirable in the interests of the persons concerned.Crime and Lunacy.12.    In Scotland a very considerable proportion of the convicted prisoners,  Borstal inmates and criminal lunatics are Irish-born or the children of an Irish-born father.      In 1925 the number was 3,508 being 25 per cent,  of the total prison population.      In 1932,  the corresponding figures were 2,070 and 15 per cent, respectively.      In England Irish-born prisoners number about 2,000 each year, being 6 per cent,  of the prison population.The number of Irish-born pauper lunatics in Scotland in 1933 was 840,  being 5.5 per cent,  of the pauper lunatics in the country,   of whom it is estimated that about 380 were born in the Free State.      No statistics  for England are available.Law as to Admission and Deportation.13 .    If it were considered that steps  should be taken to remove persons born in the Irish Free State who become, or are likely to become,  a public charge  in Great Britain,  the measures to be considered  (failing some agreement with the Irish Free State on the lines indicated in paragraph 10) would
be  (a)  povfer to refuse leave for certain categories of immigrants to land in this country,,  and (h)  power to deport undesirable classes  of persons from this  country.14.    Under the existing law of the United Kingdom, no British subject can be refused admission to the United Kingdom,   and no British subject can be deported from the United Kingdom.15.    Canada, Australia,  New Zealand,  and South Africa,   on the other hand, have imposed restrictions on the entry of British subjects who are likely,  inter alia,  to become  chargeable  to public funds,  and they have power,   subject to certain restrictions as to domicile or length of residence,  to deport British subjects who after immigration become  chargeable to public funds or commit offences.      In 1932,  4,248 British subjects were deported from Canada,  117 from Australia,  10 from South Africa,  and none from New Zealand.      The Irish Free State has so far not taken power  to deport except for sedition and crimes  of violence .      The power to deport in all these cases depends in practice on the  fact that this  country maintains an open door  for British subjects.16.    It has been calculated that  in Scotland the number of persons who could at present be returned to the Free State,  if any person was liable to deportation who within five years of arrival in the country became a public charge in the widest sense of the term (covering criminals,  lunatics, paupers and persons  in receipt of unemployment benefit or transitional payments),  would be  certainly under 3,000 and would not be likely tjo exceed 2,000.,     A scheme for deporting Free State-born persons to the Free State must,  so long as the Free State remains  in the British Commonwealth,  depend on the Free State being prepared to receive them.      If the Free State became a foreign country,  it would be under an obligation at international
17.    Apart from the persons deported from Canada,   the number of immigrants from the Dominions other than the Irish Free State who become a charge on public funds appear to be negligible.     The presence in this country of British subjects from the Colonies,  particularly coloured &quot;seamen,  occasionally gives rise to  complaint.law to receive its nationals who were deported from other countries .
