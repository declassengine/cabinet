[This Document is the Property ot His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1934.SECRET.CP. 61 (34).CABINET.Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.Policy in regard to Afghanistan.Questions for Decision.It is desirable to keep clearly distinguished the two questions which are before the Cabinet: (1) whether the policy last reaffirmed in 1928 in regard to the integrity of Afghanistan still holds good, and (2) if so, whether to acquaint the Afghan Government with our policy, or what instructions to give to our Minister at Kabul. If, as I think, the first question should be answered in the affirmative, we have then to consider separately the second question, to which quite different considerations apply.Beaffirmation of Policy of 1928.2. The policy reaffirmed in 1928 is, briefly, that the preservation of the independence and integrity of Afghanistan as a buffer State between Russia and India is of so great importaiice to Indian and Imperial interests that any substantial Russian encroachment into northern Afghanistan must be treated as a casus belli in the last resort. We now have the report of the Chiefs of the Staff that no military factors have arisen since 1928 which would make it impossible to implement this policy, and I need not dilate on the cogent arguments in favour of the policy itself, as they are familiar to my colleagues. But 1 would lay stress on the fact that the policy requires not only the independence, but the integrity of Afghanistan. As the Chiefs of Staff point out, if Russia were to conquer Afghanistan, Russia aud India would then have a common frontier of some 500 miles in length. I would merely add that our buffer State policy would equally be defeated by a Russian occupation of northern Afghanistan alone up to the Hindu Kush. For a State consisting only of the south-eastern portions of Afghanistan, deprived of the richer northern provinces, would not constitute an effective buffer ; in order to prevent Russian domination of this small and impoverished State, we might well have to take it under our protection and effective control, and we should then have a common frontier with Russia in just the same way as if Russia conquered the whole country. This point may have some relevance, as I will hope to show, to the question whether we should acquaint the Afghan Government with our policy.Question of giving the Afghan Government an Assurance of Military Support.3. The next question is whether, and, if so, what information can be given to the Afghan Government regarding our policy ; whether, in other words, we can give them some assurance beyond those already given of the action which we would take to preserve the integrity of their country, such as the assurance recommended by the Government of India of military support against military aggression by the Soviet. I. would emphasise here that this is a new proposal, which was not recommended by any of the authorities in 1928. It has now been raised for the first time, and not by His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Kabul, but by the Government of India.Grounds advanced by Government of India for their Proposal.4. There are two main grounds on which the Government of India propose that we should volunteer an assurance of this character to the Afghan Government. In the first place, while it is common ground that &quot; at present the Soviet Government neither intend nor are able to take the offensive against Afghanistan,&quot; the Government of India suggest that the natural nervousness of the Afghans regarding the possibility of such an offensive may induce them &quot; to adopt a pro-Russian policy against their better judgment,&quot; and that the Afghan Prime Minister may &quot;feel compelled to come to terms with the Soviet as the only means of saving his country.&quot; In the second 2636      80   3.34 ACopy No.
place, they suggest that an assurance of military support should be given in order that we may have the opportunity of concerting measures of defence in co-operation with the Afghans, and in particular induce them to improve the roads from India to Kabul and Kandahar up to a high standard.Assurances already given to the Afghan Government.5. I will deal first with the argument that the large commitment proposed by the Government of India is necessary because the Afghans may otherwise feel compelled to yield to the embraces of Russia. In this connection I would venture to remind my colleagues of the extent of the assurances which we have already given the Afghan Government and to draw attention to the very marked anti-Russian trend of the policy of that Government, In order that there may be no misapprehension as to what we have already told the Afghan Government, I append (Annex A.) a summary of the questions which they asked in 1931 and 1932 and of the replies which we gave to those questions. It will be seen that the Afghan Ministers asked whether they could count on any kind of support from His Majesty&apos;s Government (without specifying military support), and what would be the attitude if the Soviet attacked Afghanistan. The carefully considered replies, embodying extensive assurances, which were given were favourably received on each occasion. In 1931 the Afghan Foreign Minister said that the reply Avas all that his Government could reasonably expect, and in 1932 the Prime Minister expressed his arjpreciation of the reply, and noted particularly the very important statement that, if the Soviet attacked Afghanistan, this would be regarded by us as an attack on British and Indian interests, and would force us to take the steps normally taken by the Government of a State when its interests are seriously threatened.Requests made by Afghan Government last October.6. Since the Afghan Government received the assurances which the Cabinet decided on in 1932, they have not again raised the question of our attitude in the event of Russian aggression, nor asked for any further assurances. What they have now asked for is (1) consultation with the British General Staff in connection with the defence ofthe northern road ; and (2) arms, ammunition and aircraft on payment by instalments.These requests were made on ]2th October 1933, and though they have not since been pressed or renewed, the British Minister is naturally anxious to take some step towards replying as soon as possible. As regards a supply of munitions, though the Government of India have themselves raised certain difficulties, I think that these can be overcome, and if the Government of India agree to sell the arms, this request can be satisfactorily met. As regards the other request, the Minister himself recom-mended, and the Government of India agreed, that it should in the first instance be dealt with in the manner proposed in the joint memorandum of 2nd February. That proposal was that Sir R. Maconachie should have an informal talk with the Afghan Prime Minister with a view to showing His Majesty&apos;s Governments sympathetic interest in his problems and ascertaining exactly what he had in mind in making his request (after which the Minister could be authorised to promise military advice on the defence of the northern road with the Afghans&apos; own resources if this is what they desire). This step is the gesture that Sir R. Maconachie has been anxiously waiting to be allowed to make (which is referred to in paragraph 24 (c) of Lord Hailsham&apos;s letter of 8th February) in order to give the Afghans &quot;reason to think that we are taking their requests seriously.&quot; In telegraphing thus Sir R. Maconachie was not referring to any pending replies to the Afghan Government as to our attitude in the event of Russian aggression, for these replies were given long ago.Sir R. Maconaehie&apos;s Appreciation of existing Policy of Afghan Government, and liis Views on Question of the Proposed Assurance.7. In view of what is known of the Anglophil policy of the Afghan Government based on a realisation of the community of British and Afghan interests, and having regard also to the nature of the assurances which we have alreadj7 given, I felt that the Government of India were greatly exaggerating the risk of the Afghans being
intimidated into the adoption of a pro-Russian policy. But as the question is in any case one on which our Minister at Kabul is best qualified to advise, I suggested 1 to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that it would be desirable to obtain from Sir Lt. Maconachie a first-hand appreciation of the recent trend of the policy of the Afghans as between this country and Russia, and of the existence and degree of any risk of their adopting a pro-Russian policy. A telegram of enquiry was accordingly sent to him (Annex B). His reply of 3rd March fAnnex B) gives a most illuminating appreciation, which speaks for itself and to which I would draw the special attention of my colleagues. It confirms our previous information that the Afghan Government is definitely embarked on a pro-British and anti-Russian policy. Ever since the accession of Nadir (whose success in stabilising his regime was largely due to the handsome present of  175,000 and 10,000 rifles sanctioned by the Cabinet in July 1930), the Afghans have been drawing continuously closer to us and away from Russia. Sir R. Maconachie gives numerous recent examples which lead him to the conclusion that &quot; there is no indication that the Afghan Government have departed from their original policy of preserving and strengthening the British connection, and at the same time humouring Russia (whom they look on as the real enemy) with concessions in what they regard as unessentials.&quot;Pro-British Policy of Afghan Government.8. I would add that Nadir and his Ministers have constantly turned to Sir R. Maconachie for consultation, and in regard, for example, to frontier matters, have adopted a policjr of co-operation with us, to the extent even of aiding us in the control of the frontier by giving wholesome advice to our dissident tribesmen when they turned to the Afghan Government, in accordance with their age-long practice, for countenance and support.   In particular, the Afghan Government have always sought our advice in regard to their dealings with Russia, and it, is not too much to say that by the policy which we have pursued we have entirely won their confidence. This definite orientation of their policy, for  which great credit is due to Sir R. Maconachie, seems indeed to have been specially noteworthj7 since they received our assurances of 1932.   It will be remembered that the reason for giving those assurances was to stiffen Afghan resistance to certain dangerous demands which had at that date been made by the Soviet in regard (inter alia) to the renewal of Amanullah&apos;s permit for the air service between Termez and Kabul, and a commercial treaty of the dangerous type usual in the dealings of the Soviet Government with their Asiatic neighbours.   The position  now is that  these demands have been, rejected  and  have  not  since  been  renewed.   Arrangements  according  closely with  the  advice  we  gave  have   been made  for  the  exchange of goods with Russia, and the air service merely continues on sufferance till the northern road is fit for normal traffic.   A further remarkable development is that during the last 12   months the   Afghan   Government well aware of the political  clangers of Soviet economic penetration appear to be  doing all in their power (as will be seen from the instances cited by Sir R. Maconachie) to encourage trade with India and this country through the foreign trade monopoly which they recently established.   Perhaps the most important Afghan export is Persian lamb, in which the Soviet are geographically well placed for obtaining a monopoly. &quot;The Afghan Government have sought to counter this Soviet advantage by giving encourage-ment to British traders in this commodity.   On 4th January last an agreement was signed for the supply of petrol from India, to which our Minister rightly attaches considerable importance.   The Afghan Government have purchased from Marconi material for two wireless installations at Khanabad and Herat, and have invited tenders for  a large  station at Kabul from the  same firm, as well   as from German, French and Japanese competitors.   Arrangements for the import of dyes and chemicals are in contemplation under conditions which would probably be favourable for a contract with Imperial Chemical Industries (from whom also other orders have been carried through or are under consideration).   Two further important facts are that the Afghan Government have agreed to receive a trade delegation from India to discuss the expansion of trade between India and Afghanistan and that the appointment to London of a representative of the Afghan state trading organi-sation has been under consideration. All these unprecedented efforts, encouraged by our Minister, to foster trade with us are undoubtedly actuated by political motives and appear to signify a recent acceleration in the movement of Afghanistan towards tub and away from Russia.   Moreover, the theory of intimidation by the Soviet is not
&quot;borne out by recent, secret information, which shows that the Afghan Government have taken a most firm stand in regard to certain matters.Anti-Russian Temperament of Afghan Prime Minister.9. Finally, we must bear in mind the personality of the present Afghan Prime Minister, Muhammad Hashim, uncle of the young King and real ruler of the country. It is well known that one of his principal characteristics is his dislike of the Soviet, dating from the time when he was Amanullah&apos;s Ambassador at Moscow. Sir R. Maconachie has twice recently reported that he has no reason to think that the Afghan Government would commit themselves seriously to Russia so long as the present Prime Minister is in power. It is true that Muhammad J:Iashim&apos;s life cannot be regarded as a very safe one. Put his disappearance would probably be followed by a period of internal disturbance and possibly even anarchy, during which there would be no stable Afghan Government that we could make the recipient of further assurances or possibly even recognise.Is it necessary to give Afghan Government an Assurance of Military Support?10. I have troubled my colleagues with, these facts regarding our present relations with the Afghan Government and the assurances which we have already given them, because they are relevant to the question whether there is any grave danger of our &quot; driving the Afghans into the arms of Russia &quot; unless we now give them a further assurance. We have an Afghan Government which, by a just appreciation of its own true interests, is pro-British and anti-Russian ; we have recently given them certain significant assurances to strengthen them against their fear of Soviet pressure ; their policy has recently been marked by, if anything, an even more pronounced pro-British trend, and they show no signs of any serious commitment to Russia or of being intimidated into compliance with Soviet demands. Is it, then, necessary for us to enter into the far-reaching commitment recommended by the Government of India for the purpose of preventing the adoption by the Afghan Government of a pro-Russian policy against their better judgment ? As this is a new proposal, the burden of proof lies, of course, on those who make it.Government of India s desire for Improvement of Roads to Kabul and Kandahar.11. The second ground on which the Government of India support their recommendation is that if we inform the Afghan Government of our policy of military support we shall gain the advantage of concerting measures of defence with them, and especially that we shall be able to induce them to improve the roads from the Indian frontier to Kabul and Kandahar up to the standard required to enable us to give effective military support when lite time comes. As regards this, Sir R. Maconachie has separately reported that the Afghan Government are already committed to the effective improvement of these roads, though their standard of construction is not likely in the ordinary course to be so high as to satisfy our military requirements. He has suggested two alternatives to an assurance of military support. The first is that we should inform the Afghan Government that, while it is impossible to commit ourselves to a definite assurance in the unknown circumstances of any future contingency, it would in fact be impracticable to give them military assistance unless these roads were first greatly improved. The second would be to give a substantial contribution in money, either from His Majesty&apos;s Government or the Government of India, towards the improvement of these roads. Tins alternative would be in accordance with the principle recommended in paragraph 53 (a) of the Defence of India committee&apos;s Report of 1927 and with the policy of occasional &quot; subsidy in kind &quot; towards projects which promote the mutual interests of Afghanistan and ourselves.Disadvantages of giving the proposed Assurance.12. I must now touch on the disadvantages, as they appear to me, of the proposed assurance of military support.   They are as follows : (i) It will be remembered that the Defence of India Committee of 1927 concluded against informing the Afghans of our policy because of the danger that Amanullah would adopt an arrogant attitude towards Russia, and we should then &quot; have surrendered the issues of peace or war with the Soviet to the
incalculable actions of an unbalanced and unscrupulous barbarian.&quot;   With the disappearance of the impulsive Amanullah and the establishment of the present regime this danger is less than it was.   But we have to remember that since the assassination of Nadir the stability of the present Government is again less secure than we could wish, and that, in the event of its falling, we cannot foresee the character of the Government that may succeed it. Moreover, whereas Nadir&apos;s cautious temperament could have been safely relied on, Muhammad Hashim is temperamentally anti-Russian, and the risk of his adopting a provocative attitude cannot be entirely discounted. If, however, it were decided to give the suggested assurance, it would be possible to some extent to guard  against  this particular danger of a provocative Afghan attitude towards Russia by means of a careful caveat. A public announcement of our policy would, of course, be open to over-whelming objections, among others to those that are clearly explained in paragraph   2  of  the Government of India&apos;s Despatch  of 4th January (CP. 40 (31)).   The primary desideratum of our policy at present must be to preserve and strengthen the stability of the Afghan regime, shaken as it must have been by the assassination of Nadir.   The chief menace to its stabilitj&apos;- conies from the propaganda of disaffected Afghans and the Soviet to the effect that the regime is subservient to British interests.   A public announcement of our policy would be represented by these enemies of the Afghan Government as meaning that the latter had sold their country to the British, and this would be &quot; extremely damaging, if not fatal, to the present Government in Afghanistan.&quot;   A public announcement is therefore out of the question ; but, the point to which 1 would draw the attention of my colleagues is that the same unfortunate consequences would be likely to ensue from even a confidential assurance in proportion as it leaked out, and that it might be very difficult to keep it confidential and at the same time to obtain the advantages, which the Government of India look for, of concerting measures of defence and  ensuring  (presumably by inspection) a high standard of road construction in Afghanistan. On the other hand, an unpublished assurance cannot constitute an inter-national engagement, because such unpublished engagements are forbidden by Article 18 of the Covenant of the League of Nations and declared not to be binding.   Consequently, an assurance could only amount to a statement Of our present policy.   This means that, looking at the matter from the Afghan point of view, there would in the nature of the case be some uncertainty as to its durability.   It seems to me essential that we should leave the Afghans under no illusion as to this degree of uncertainty.   For if it is not made clear to them, and if by any chance when the time for action comes there were a change of policy, the assurance which they thought they had received would not be implemented, or not so fully as they expected, and this would have the most disastrous consequences on our reputation for good faith throughout Asia.   It would, therefore, in my view, be necessary to make it clear that any statement which we made to the Afghan Government did not go beyond a statement of present policy, with the element of xmcertainty that that involves.   But the question, of course, then arises whether such a statement would be of appreciably greater value to the Afghan Government than the assurances which we have already given them.) In the military conversations for concerting measures of defence which, as proposed by the Government of India, would follow a statement of our policy, the Afghans might well ask us awkward questions to which, in the present state of our military plan, we might find it difficult to give such replies as they would consider satisfactory. For, while I understand that the General Staffs at home and in India are agreed on the first phase of the operations, which would take us to the hue Kabul-Kandahar, I am not aware that agreement yet exists as to a plan, or alternative plans, for the second phase i.e. the question (which to the Afghans must be all-important) of the means to be employed for forcing the Russians out of the northern provinces. Unless in the discussion of measures of defence we could satisfy the Afghans that we had a pretty clear idea of the means, not only of defending Kabid, but of freeing their country from the invader, it is to be feared that the Afghans might lose heart ; they might doubt whether we had the effective means of securing the political objective, namely, the2636 B
Gintegrity of Afghanistan, or whether we took sufficient interest in their northern provinces to justify them in relying on our military support; with characteristic suspicion they might even doubt whether the integrity of Afghanistan is our primary concern. In any of these cases the result of our declaration to them might be the reverse of what we hoped for, and defeat otrr own purpose of stiffening their resistance to possible Soviet pressure.Conclusion.13. In view of the various considerations suggested above-the fact that we have already given the Afghans extensive assurances ; the pro-British trend of their policy, and the disadvantages of a specinc assurance of military support it appears to me that the further assurance proposed by the Government of India is neither necessary nor advisable. It can hardly be considered necessary merely for the purpose of the improvement of the roads from India to Kabul and Kandahar, for it should be possible to provide for this by other means, and it cannot in any case be a matter of great urgency since it is agreed that Russia at present has neither the will nor the power for a military offensive against Afghanistan. As regards the other argument, that the proposed assurance is necessary for the purpose of preventing the adoption of a pro-Russian policy by the Afghans, I think my colleagues will agree that this is contrary to all the weight of the evidence. My views on this point are more than confirmed by the careful conclusion of our Minister at Kabul in paragraph 16 of his telegram of 3rd March, that for the purpose of guarding against this supposed risk there is no necessity in existing circumstances and in such probable future conditions as he can foresee for the assurance proposed by the Government of India (nor even, he adds so far as this risk is concerned for a promise of arms or military conversations aborrt the northern road). Naturally, if at some future time the position should be materially altered by conditions at present unforeseen, it will always be open to us to reconsider the question whether we can enlarge the assurances which we have already given.   But in present conditions there is no case for doing so.Suggested Action.14. I would, therefore, suggest the following conclusions for my colleagues&apos; consideration ;  ?(1) That we should decide not to give the assurance suggested by the Government of India in view of the absence of any necessity for it and the weighty reasons against it.(2) That we should deal with the Afghan Governments requests of 12th October last in the following manner. It will be observed that in our Ministers opinion, while there is no real danger of an Afghan commitment to Russia, it is desirable to consider these requests favourably, in order to ensure a continuance of the Afghans&apos; present policy of co-operation with us in controlling the tribes on the Indian frontier. He thinks that the action suggested in paragraph 3 (a) and (6) of our telegram of 1st March would be adequate for this purpose. I feel strongly that, both for the limited purpose which he has in view and on wider grounds of policy, Ave should adopt his recommendation and instruct him as follows. He should agree to the request for the sale of munitions if the GoA^erument of India, on receiving information as to the Afghan requirements and method of payment, agree to this sale (and I have no reason to doubt that it will be possible to persuade them) and are able to supply them. As regards&apos; the other request, he should at once take the step, which he has adA-ocated and to Avhich the Government of India have agreed, to ascertain in a friendly talk Avith the Afghan Prime Minister what he had in mind in suggesting consultation with our General Staff in connection Avith the defence of the northern road. He should be instructed that, if it then appears (as the request, taken at its face A^value, seems to suggest) that the Afghan Govern-ment are seeking advice on the question of defending the northern road Avith their own resources, he should promise the military consultation which they desire ; but that if it appears that the Afghan request was designed to draw us into a military commitment, he should confine himself to a confirmation of the assurances which we have already given. If the Afghan Prime Minister Avere not satisfied with this confirmation, Sir R. Maconachie Avould.report for further instructions.India. Office, S. H.9th March 1934.
ANNEX A.Enquiries received from Afghan Government, and Replies given in 1931 and 1932.I. On 22nd April 1931 the Afghan Foreign Minister enquired what the attitude -of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the Government of India would he in the event of war between Russia and Afghanistan. He asked whether, in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Soviet, Afghanistan could count on any kind of support from His Majesty&apos;s Government, and stated that, without knowledge of the answer to this question, the foreign policy of his Government must remain fluid and opportunist, necessitating an attitude of surrender towards any demand which the Soviet Government might make and press home.After careful consideration of the matter by the Ministers concerned (Mr. Henderson and Mr. Benn), Sir R. Maconachie on 30th July 1931 gave a reply, the main substance of which was that, since British interests include the maintenance of a strong, independent and friendly Afghanistan, His Majesty&apos;s Government naturally could not regard with iudifference unprovoked aggression by a foreign Power against a friendly Afghanistan, but that the exact steps to be taken in that event must depend upon the circumstances of the moment. The reply also included an explanation of the relevant provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The Afghan Govern-ment expressed no dissatisfaction with this reply. The Afghan Foreign Minister said that even if it was not all that his Government could desire, it was, he thought, all that they could reasonably expect.II. On 29th March 1932 the Afghan Prime Minister and Foreign Minister enumerated the demands which were then being pressed by the Soviet. They included, besides many others : (i) Renewal of the agreement, which had been granted by Amaivullah, but has since lapsed, providing for a Russian air service between Termez and Kabul.(ii) Discussion of a project for a through&apos; air mail service from Russia throughAfghanistan to India.(iii) The conclusion of a commercial treaty, involving a system of State exchangeof goods and extra-territorial rights for Soviet trade officials and premises. The Afghan Foreign Minister stated that this meant a network of spies and propagandists all over Afghanistan up to the Indian border.The Afghan Ministers stated that the Afghan Government had hitherto rejected or evaded these demands, but were in doubt whether they could continue this attitude indefinitely and what they were to do if the Soviet applied pressure to obtain the commercial treaty. In conclusion, they asked for information to enable them to appreciate their own position and that of neighbouring Governments, viz.: (1) What was the political situation in Russia, and, in particular, were the Soviet in a position to attack Afghanistan ?(2) If the Soviet attacked Afghanistan, what would be the attitude of His Majestj^s Government and the Government of India, or the League of Nations ?They stated that these questions were vital and urgent, since on the answers to them would depend the attitude of the Afghan Government towards the Soviet in future and the possibility of their maintaining their present relations, as they sincerely desired to do, with His Majesty&apos;s Government.After consideration by the Cabinet, Sir R. Maconachie was instructed in the Despatch of 17th October 1932 to inform the Afghan Government as follows : (1) In the considered opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government there is no immediate danger of the Soviet attacking Afghanistan or applying forcible pressure. (The reasons for this opinion were elaborated in a memorandum given to Sir R. Maconachie for his use in conversation with the Afghan Government.)(2) (a) The replies which His Majesty&apos;s Government were in a position to give were not to be regarded as necessarily holding good for all time and in all circumstances ; they held good only in existing conditions, or so long as conditions so far as this country, Afghanistan and Russia are concerned remain materially the same as at present.(b) Subject to the above general caveat, if the Soviet attacked Afghanistan, this would be regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom
aand the Government of India as an attack on British and Indian interests,, and would force them to take the steps normally taken by the Government of a State when its interests are seriously threatened. The immediate step to be taken would clearly be diplomatic intervention, which might be followed if necessary by pressure in the sphere of economic relations.(c) A suggestion was incidentally added that Afghanistan&apos;s position would be strengthened by entry into the League of Nations, but this was accompanied by the statement that His Majesty&apos;s Government would always regard themselves as the Power primarily interested in the maintenance of her independence by Afghanistan.(d) It was also stated that in the event of a serious invasion of Afghan territory by Russia, and provided that such Russian action were clearly unprovoked by any action on the part of the Afghan Government, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfc would be prepared, if their previous diplomatic intervention had failed, to break off diplomatic and official commercial relations with the Soviet Government, but that this was the furthest length to which His MajestyV Government were prepared to go towards defining their attitude in advance, and the question whether any further action could be taken, if and when the case arose, would depend entirely upon circumstances at the time.Sir R. Maconachie made these communications to the Afghan Prime Minister and Foreign Minister on 1st and 14th December 1932. They were well received,, particularly the first sentence of 2 (b) above.III. On 12th October 1933 the Afghan Prime Minister said that the Afghan Government (i) wished to consult the British General Staff in connection with the defence ofthe northern road ; (ii) needed arms, ammunition and aircraft on payment by instalments.These are the two requests which are awaiting reply.ANNEX B.Telegram from Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty&apos;s Minister,Kabul, dated 1st March 1934.18. My telegram 22nd February, No. 15. His Majesty&apos;s Government have under urgent consideration whether if 1927 policy were reaffirmed they should promise Afghan Government military support against Russian aggression.2. It would be of great assistance to them if you could telegraph full information on following points : (a) Recent general trend of Afghan policy as between this country and Russia.(b) Effect of decision of 1932, in the light of your experience since that date, onattitude and policy of Afghan Government.3. Besides above information, please also telegraph your views on following questions on the basis of your replies to above questions : Does attitude of Afghan Government indicate, in your opinion, any risk at present or in near future of their being intimidated by the Soviet Government into adoption of a pro-Russian policy ? If so, is such risk so great that nothing less than the further assurance proposed by the Government of India in their Despatch No. 1 of 4th January would guard us against it? Or would it suffice (a) to promise sale of arms and military conversations about northern road, with a view to advising Afghan Government as to best method of defending it with their own resources, and (b) to repeat previous assurances if it should appear in the course of the conversations that Afghans are angling for a promise of military support ?4. We should be grateful if you could telegraph by 5th March self-contained and self-explanatory appreciation covering the above points which can be circulated as it stands in time for consideration on 7th March.
Telegram from His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul to Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, dated 3rd March 1934.Forminka 18.2. Tenour of my instructions has obliged me to avoid such conversations with Afghan Ministers as would give them opening for pressing their requests regarding military advice by General Staff and supply of arms on payment. Consequently, I have been unable lately to discuss with them policy of their Government towards Russia, and my replies to your enquiries regarding recent developments must, therefore, consist mainly of inferences from such facts as have been ascertained.3. Recent general trend of Afghan policy as between United Kingdom and Russia (your paragraph No. 2 (a)).(a) There has been no indication that Afghan Government have modified the conviction, which formed basis of their foreign policy, that Russia aimed at penetration of India through Afghanistan, and that therefore British and Afghan interests are essentially identical, viz. defensive as against offensive policy of Soviet Government.(b) Afghan Prime Minister lias more than once based his objections to coerciveaction by Government of India against tribes of North-West Frontier on alleged tendency of such action to prejudice solidarity of (i) India, (ii) frontier tribes, (iii) Afghanistan, in resistance to Soviet attack, which he regards as surely coming. Inference is. that he tends to regard British support against Russian aggression as in fact assured to Afghanistan by force of circumstances apart from any declaration of policy by His Majesty&apos;s Government.(c) But although their convictions on the broad issues remain unshaken, AfghanGovernment are occasionally compelled by the weakness of their position to meet immediate dangers by action which prejudices what they know to be their ultimate interests.4. Question then is whether they have recently taken action of this kind in (i) military, (ii) political, (iii) economic spheres.5. (i) Military. (a) Either by acceptance of gifts or by purchase they have adopted British&quot; 303 rifle as standard armament.(b) In October last they made purchase of ammunition from Imperial Chemicals.(c) They sent their air officers by invitation to see demonstrations by Royal AirForce, India, and have subsequently requested advice of latter regarding types of aircraft suitable for Afghanistan.(d) They have constructed road through the Hindu Kush to northern provincesin order to establish their own control of that area, not in order to link up with Russian system of communications. In fact, mere suggestion of latter possibility by Soviet Military Attache resulted immediately in their requesting advice of British General Staff regarding defence of this road against possible Russian aggression.6. On the other hand, they have, whether seriously or otherwise, enquired the price at which Soviet Government would supply them with artillery.7. (ii) Political. (a) Government of Nadir Shah within the period of four years concluded or ratified treaties with Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland (i.e. in Foreign Ministers words, &quot;little Powers threatened by Russia&quot;) and with Japan, which they regard as inveterate enemy of Russia.(6) All four local leaders of the Sikh Ghadr party, whom the Afghan Government, describe as most dangerous Soviet agents, have been arrested and imprisoned.(c) In September last they executed Muhammad Wali, on \shose behalf, when hewas tried for sedition in 1929, Soviet Embassy had made representations. It was common knowledge here that this man was the favourite of the Soviet. Embassy.(d) They claim to have definite evidence to prove that the Soviet authorities were concerned in seditious activities of Ghulam Nabi, who was executed in November 1932, and in intrigues of Amanulla as shown by letter from the latter to Ghulam Nabi, of which, at the request of the Afghan Government, I transmitted translation to you.
(e) They frequently inform me of alleged Soviet intrigues affecting, India and have even passed on to me photograph, given them by Soviet informant, of supposed British. Secret Service Agent.(/) They restrict intercourse of Soviet Consuls with all strangers ; e.g., Goldman, recently here, told me that he was unable to call on Soviet Consul at Herat without Afghan Governors permission, and Italian engineer was recently sent away under arrest from Mazar-i-Sharif for being too friendly with Soviet Consulate there.8. On the other hand (a:) They signed Eight-Power Convention regarding Definition of Aggressor with the Soviet Government. Foreign Minister explained this as in accordance with policy of accepting, while not trusting, any pacific assurance offered by Russia.(y) Although they undertook to close down Russian air service, Termez-Kabul, as soon as new northern road was opeued, this service still continues. Foreign Minister has reiterated undertaking, but said that condition of the road would not at present justify closure of the air service. This statement is confirmed by independent information.(z) Afghan Government favour and employ one, Maulvi Bashir, who, according to our intelligence, is dangerous Soviet agent. Afghan Government admit their own attitude towards this man, but absolutely deny correctness of our information regarding his character.9. (iii) Economic : (a) They have definitely refused Soviet demand for Commercial Treaty, butoffered exchange of goods on basis of barter through State agencies on either side so as to prevent political penetration of country by communist agents, in guise of local representatives of Soviet organisations. Soviet Embassy at first refused, but later accepted this.(b) Last January they concluded agreement with Burma-Shell for future supplyof petroleum products from British India.(c) Last autumn they negotiated sale of quantity of Persian lamb to British firm and agreement for large annual sales to this firm in future. Agreement, fell through owing to attitude, not of Afghan Government, but of British firm.(d) They have accepted proposal that trade delegation from India should visitKabul to explore possibility of mutual expansion of British Indian and Afghan trade.(e) They have purchased two wireless installations for Kabul and Herat fromBritish Marconi&apos;s and contemplate placing further orders with the same firm..10. On the other hand (x) They have admitted mission of Russian experts for destruction of locusts in northern Provinces. Mission is reported to consist exclusively of members-of Communist Party and to be politically active. Although local Afghan Governor was reported to have recommended that numbers of mission should be drastically reduced this has not apparently been done.(y) They recently concluded agreement with Soviet organisation for exchange of&apos; Persian lamb from Afghanistan for Russian sugar and petrol in accordance with (iii) (a) above.   (This agreement is  now  reported  to have been suspended for reasons not yet definitely ascertained.)11. My conclusion is that on the facts known to us there is no indication that the Afghan Government have departed from original policy of preserving and strengthening British connection and, at the same time, humouring Russia (whom they look on as real enemy) with concessions in what they regard as unessentials. They are, however, greatly impressed by constitutional developments in India as indicating impending abdication of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as well as by Japan&apos;s firmness of purpose and growing strength. Consequently they look on Japan as destined successor to His Majesty&apos;s Government, both in control of India and as supporter of Afghanistan against Russian aggression.12. Effect of decision of 1932 on attitude and policy of Afghan Government (your paragraphs (b)). I have no definite evidence.   Decision was well received at
the time and, since it was communicated to them, Afghan Government have not -ashed for it to he modified. Their general policy as outlined above was laid down by Nadir Shah in 1930, and how far decision of 1932 has contributed to their adherence to it must be matter of speculation (arrangements for exchange of goods on basis of barter, paragraph 9 (iii) (a) above, accord very closely with advice given by His Majesty&apos;s Government through me in 1932).13. Risk of Afghan Government being intimidated by Soviet Government at present, or in near future, into adoption of pro-Russian policy and measures proposed for preventing developments of this hind (your paragraph 3). In existing conditions, viz., with present Prime Minister in power, no internal disturbance iu Afghanistan, and Soviet Government apparently not prepared to threaten military pressure, I do not think there is serious risk of this kind. Afghan Government seem, at present, to regard any protests of Soviet Government with comparative equanimity owing to supposed preoccupation of latter with Far-eastern situation.14. Position would be radically altered if : (i) Prime Minister disappeared, with disturbances throughout the country andmarked weakening of Afghan Government as result. Such developments seem quite possible at any moment, and Soviet Government might then be able to enforce modification of present Afghan policy to almost any extent by silent threat of subversive intrigue in northern Provinces.(ii) Policy and circumstances of Soviet Government changed in such a way as to lead them to employ military measures to achieve their objectives in Afghanistan.15. In the event of (i) above, I do not see that any assurance of support by His Majesty&apos;s Government would be likely to restore the situation, since the real danger would arise from collapse of central Afghan Government, and in the event of (ii) occasion would appear to be one for action rather than assurances.16. In the existing circumstances, therefore, and such conditions as I can foresee as probable in the near future, it does not seem that either assurance proposed by Government of India or alternative mentioned in your paragraph 3 (a) and (b) would be necessary for purposes of preventing the adoption by the Afghan Government of pro-Russian policy.17. Real danger at present seems to me that unless His Majesty&apos;s Government show themselves ready to give favourable consideration to Afghan enquiries regarding military advice and supplying of arms, Afghan Government may register their disgust by discontinuance of the present policy of co-operation on the Indian frontier. Alternatives in paragraph 3 (a) and (b) of your telegram should, however, in my opinion be sufficient to obviate this danger.
