this document is the property op his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1934.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.CP. 17 (34).[E 242/1/93]CABINET.THE ASSYRIAN QUESTION THE PRESENT POSITION;THE interest taken in the Assyrian question by certain sections of public opinion was reflected by a deputation of Members of Parliament which I received on the eve of my recent visit to Italy. I promised the deputation to bring their views to the notice of the Cabinet, and the following is a brief summary of what passed :  2.   The deputation consisted of Sir R. Mitchell Banks, Lord Hugh Cecil, Sir A. T. Wilson and Colonel Wedgwood.3. Emphasis was laid on what the deputation considered to be the grave moral responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government, arising partly from the participation of the Assyrians in the war, and the hopes, alleged to have been held out to them, of autonomy after the war, but chiefly from the service which the Assyrians have performed in the levies in Iraq since the war. Their service in this capacity had not only saved Great Britain considerable expense, but had done more than anything to make the Assyrians unpopular with the Arabs and the Kurds. Reference was also made to the frequently quoted statement by Sir F. Humphrys to the Permanent Mandates Commission in 1931 regarding the moral responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government in connexion with the termination of the mandatory regime in Iraq. It was claimed that, whatever view might be held about the meaning of that statement, it was probably true to say that, if it had not been made, the League would not have decided to terminate&apos; the mandate. The main object of the deputation was to appeal to His Majesty&apos;s Government not to attempt to minimise their responsibility, but, on the contrary, to discharge that responsibility by a money payment to supplement the contribution towards Assyrian resettlement outside Iraq, which the Iraqi representative at the meeting of the Council in October last had promised on behalf of his country.4. Lord Hugh Cecil regarded this as a matter in which the honour of His Majesty&apos;s Government was involved, while Sir A. T. Wilson expanded the more material argument that by using Assyrian battalions in Iraq instead of British soldiers, this country had been saved several million pounds. He thought the saving must have amounted to as much as  500,000 a year, and he contended that a revolving fund of, say,  250,000 would be a small return for this annual cash saving.5. Colonel Wedgwood, although agreeing with his colleagues regarding-the responsibility which lay with His Majesty&apos;s Government, was not in agree-ment with them as to the solution. The proper solution, in his view, was not to pay money for the migration of the Assyrians, but to afford them adequate British protection in Iraq. He advocated the appointment of a &quot;British repre-sentative in the Assyrian area either a consul or a missionary to look after-Assyrian interests and to report on their plight to the Foreign Office.6. I pointed out the obvious practical difficulties involved in affording such protection. Either it must be by agreement with the Iraqi Government, and such agreement was unlikely, or it must depend ultimately on force.   The other7200   [9521]
members of the delegation appeared to agree with me that the question could only be faced on the basis of the fact that the League Council had appointed a committee with the object of transferring the Assyrians outside Iraq. I made no secret of the fact that this transfer was turning out unexpectedly difficult. It was not easy to find a foreign country willing to receive the Assyrians in a single area. Various parts of the Empire had also been considered, but in each case the difficulties appeared insuperable. There was, in fact, no promising alternative to the scheme for settlement in Brazil, which had been favourably reported on, but which was still the subject of discussion between the Brazilian Government and the Council Committee. I made it clear that I had no desire to minimise the importance of the Assyrian question or to treat it on purely legal and technical lines. It was not clear that moral responsibility could be measured in money; and in any case the question of a monetary contribution was a Treasury and Cabinet matter. It was quite plain that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to bear their share of the liability, and it was not fair to say that they were disclaiming responsibility; but it was one thing to say that they would pay their fair share of a League contribution, and quite another to entrust the work of settlement to a League Committee, and simply to say that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would bear the cost. Obviously His Majesty&apos;s Government could not give carte blanche to the League.7. It may be useful to my colleagues if I add to the above summary a brief account of the present position of the Assyrian resettlement question.8. As I have already indicated, the solution of this question has proved unexpectedly difficult. If the matter were not urgent and if it were simply a question of settling so many individuals in groups or batches wherever suitable land could be found, the problem of the settlement of 10,000 to 20,000 persons might not be a very formidable one. In the present case, however, it is, in the first place, a matter of trying to find an area in which all the Assyrians in Iraq, numbering some 20,000 persons, can, if they so wish, be settled together in a homogeneous unit. Not only is it difficult to find an uninhabited or practically uninhabited area sufficiently large, but Governments are apt to think twice before allowing the establishment in their territory of an enclave consisting of a little-known race which does not seem predisposed to assimilation. On the other hand, it has been repeatedly emphasised that the situation in Iraq, following upon the events of last summer, is inevitably tense and that, if the Assyrians are not resettled outside Iraq in the near future, there will be a serious and imminent risk of a recrudescence in Northern Iraq of trouble and bloodshed which it may be most difficult to localise.9. The committee which was set up by the Council on the 14th October last has had under consideration the possibility of settling the Assyrians in a number of different countries, and, although the replies from certain Government who were approached among them, the Governments of South Africa, Australia, Canada and New Zealand are still awaited, the only concrete scheme which has so far appeared sufficiently practicable to enable the committee to take it into consideration is one prepared by the Nansen Office for settlement on land belonging to a British firm of high standing Parana Plantations (Limited)  in Brazil. Some details of this scheme were given in CP. 272 (33), which was considered by the Cabinet on the 15th November, in connexion with the question of a possible financial contribution by His Majesty&apos;s Government.10. Progress with this scheme has been delayed by difficulties with the Brazilian Government. Owing in the main to suspicion, bred by lack of knowledge of the Assyrians, the Brazilian Government, contrary to expectations, declared themselves prepare ^ed to accept only 100 families (500 souls) as an experiment. This, of course, offered no solution to the urgent problem which faced the Council Committee. The committee accordingly made every effort to dispel the apprehensions of the Brazilian Government and to induce them to change their mind. As the president of the Council Committee is a Spaniard, representations were made in Rio de Janeiro by the Spanish Ambassador on behalf of the committee, but, on my instructions, he was aided unofficially by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rio de Janeii-o. I also appealed to the Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs, expressing the hope that the matter might
be reconsidered. The Brazilian Ambassador informed me on the 9th January that, in response to this personal message, his Government had decided to modify their attitude, and they have now informed the Council Committee that they are willing to accept all the Assyrians in groups of 500 families a month, as and when Parana Plantations (Limited) can find accommodation for them, on three conditions : (a) That the Assyrians are agriculturalists; (b) that no expense devolves on Brazil; and (c) that Parana Plantations (Limited) assume responsibility for repatriating them or settling them elsewhere at their own expense if they do not adapt themselves to Brazil.11. The third of these conditions is obviously impracticable. The reply is, however, a great advance, and the Brazilian scheme must now be definitely regarded as a practical possibility.12. The Council Committee, which resumed their meetings on the 15th January, are considering the conditions made by the Brazilian Government and other details connected with the scheme. In the first place, however, they have thought it essential to make sure that the Assyrians are likely to thrive in the area concerned, by sending out an investigator qualified to form an opinion by reason of his special knowledge of Assyrian needs and requirements. They have accordingly passed a Resolution entrusting this investigation to Brigadier J. G. Browne, C.M.G., C.B.E., D.S.O., who, from April 1926 to April 1933 commanded the Assyrian Levies in Iraq. Brigadier Browne will be accompanied as experts by representatives of the Nansen Office and by the Counsellor of the Swiss Legation at Rio de Janeiro.13. Although, therefore, much remains to be done before the Brazilian scheme can be placed before the Assyrians, the Council Committee will, no doubt, feel able to report to the Council that there is sufficient prospect of this scheme proving suitable to justify it in asking the Council to consider the means of financing it, as, otherwise, further material progress in settling the Assyrians may be found impossible before the next session of the Council in May. A request to the Council in this sense is likely to raise a most difficult problem. It will be remembered that at the Council meeting on the 14th October, the Iraqi delegate promised on behalf of his Government as generous a contribution as the resources of Iraq would permit. So far the Iraqi Government have not committed themselves to a definite figure, but Sir F. Humphrys thinks that it will be impossible to obtain from them more than  100,000, whereas the cost of resettling the Assyrians in Brazil is likely to vary between  300,000 and  600,000, according to the number who elect to go. His Majesty&apos;s Government for their part have declared that, while they can only contemplate payment as part of a League scheme, they are prepared to bear their share of a League contribution. Unfortunately, the provision of a League contribution, at all events on the scale required, is likely to meet with the most serious obstacles.14. The United Kingdom representative on the Council will, of course, press to the utmost the claim that this is a League responsibility which should be met out of League funds, but there will be great difficulty in getting this view adopted. In fact, there seem to be no League funds available. The danger will be that the Brazilian scheme may be threatened with shipwreck for want of finance, in which case (as the report of the above interview shows) there will not be wanting critics in Parliament.J.
