fThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1934.SECRET.CP. 51 (34). Copy No. ...?.%.CABINET.Proposals of the Government of India foi? the Extension of Special Powers for dealing with Terrorists to Assam.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.The increase in the effectiveness of the measures taken in Bengal against the terrorists has had the result of driving some of the members of the terrorist organisations outside the Province into Assam. In the last few months of last year several armed dacoities occurred iu the Sylhet district of Assam which the investiga-tions of the police have shown to be the work of terrorists operating on the same lines and to some extent in conjunction with similar organisations in Bengal. It is known that the principal Bengal terrorist organisations now have branches in the districts of Assam adjacent to Bengal and there is reason to believe that other outrages have been and are being planned.In estimating the true significance of the proposals which the Government of India have put forward for dealing with this situation by the extension of special legislation to Assam, it is important to bear in mind that the areas affected in Assam are geographically and ethnologically part of Bengal, and that the whole movement, both in Assam and Bengal, is one and the same movement and springs from the same origin in Bengal. Movements such as the Terrorist movement in Bengal invariably tend to have special reactions on the neighbouring Province, and it is essential to take effective action immediately to nip the development of terrorism in Assam in the bud. It is no less important from the point of view of the Government of Bengal that steps should be taken to deal with terrorists who cross the border into Assam ; otherwise much of the value of the good work done by the police in Bengal itself will be wasted.The problem is, in fact, a joint one and demands full co-operation between the authorities in both Provinces. In order to render this co-operation effective the Government of India consider it necessary that certain of the special powers witli which the authorities in Bengal are armed under the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act and other recent Acts should be extended to Assam. The Government of Assam have drafted a Bill accordingly which they desire to introduce in the Assam Council immediately. A summary of the main provisions of this BiU is attached. The most important provisions are those dealing with the arrest and detention of terrorist suspects without trial and those dealing with the institution of special Courts to deal with terrorist offenders. These provisions are taken directly from the existing Bengal legislation. It is also proposed to enact the penalty of death for attempted murder. It is not proposed that the provisions of the Bill should apply to the whole Province automatically, but they will be extended by notification to those districts only where terrorism is active. Although it must be anticipated that the extension of this special legislation to Assam will be misrepresented in this country, I feel it impossible to oppose a proposal of this nature put forward by the Government of India with the joiut support of the Governors of both Provinces, who are convinced that it is essential for the safeguarding of the lives of Europeans. To the criticism that this measure is an indication that terrorism is spreading all over India there is an effective reply on the line that the districts of Assam affected are really Bengali ones and that the trouble is really only an extension of the main terrorist conspiracy in Bengal. I would therefore propose to sanction the introduction in the Assam Council of a Bill on the lines proposed. The Government of Assam find it difficult to forecast the prospects of the Bill being passed by the Council, but they think it possible that it will be passed by a narrow majority. I presume that if it is not passed they intend to certify it, but I am not clear whether they consider that all the provisions of the Bill would necessarily have to be certified or whether they would be prepared to agree to the omission of certain clauses, as, for instance, the death penalty for attempted murder, if that would facilitate the passage of the rest of the Bill. I propose to make further enquiries from the Government of India on this point.The Bill as introduced will be without limit of time, but if restriction to five years Avould facilitate its acceptance the Government of India would not press the point.India Office, S. H.3rd March 1934,2627      65   3.34 [p.T.O.
Summary of the Provisions of the Bill.Sections 1-15 provide for trial by special tribunal, as in Bengal, of cases involving seditious conspiracy, rioting, murder, grievous hurt, dacoity, use of bombs, criminal intimidation, kidnapping and the like, when the offenders are considered by the Local Governments to be members of a terrorist body. Tribunals to consist of Commissioners appointed by the Local Government, and to proceed in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure, with certain modifications designed to increase speed and efficiency, such as power to proceed in the absence of refractory accused, to exclude the public from a trial, to include in a trial already proceeding accused who were absconding when the trial began, to avoid unnecessary reiteration of evidence, &amp;c. Appeal from tribunals to lie to the High Court, and sentences of death to be confirmed by the High Court in any case. Tribunals to be empowered to sentence to death for attempted murder.The effect of these sections is to extend to Assam the sj^stem of trial of terrorist cases by special tribunals already existing in Bengal. It may be noted that while the tribunals will have the power not provided for in the ordinary Penal Code of sentencing to death for attempted murder, which was extended to the Bengal tribunals in 1932, there is not any proposal (such as the Bengal Government is at present making in a Bill before the Bengal Council) to empower them to condemn to death for offences under the Arms Act, viz. for the possession, manufacture, sale, &amp;c, of arms for terrorist purposes.Sections 16-29 provide powers, as in Bengal, to deal with terrorists who on good evidence are suspected of the intention to commit a terrorist crime or who are members of a terrorist organisation A suspect may be committed to custody in a jail or detention camp, or may be served with an Order to notify his movements, report to the police, remain in, or out of, a specified area, or conduct himself in a specified manner. Detailed provision is made for the serving of Orders, which need not necessarily be served in person if they are published in the Gazette and Press. The onus of proof of ignorance of an Order rests on the suspect himself. The evidence on which an Order against a suspect is based, together with a statement of the Governments allegations against the suspect and the snspect&apos;s repty to the allegations, must be examined within a month by two judges, who must report to the Local Government whether or not in their opinion there is lawful and sufficient cause for the Order. Power is also given to arrest suspects without warrant and detain them for not more than 15 days, to search places suspected of being used or about to be used for terrorist purposes, and to pay allowances at discretion to detenus&apos; families.The effect of sections 16-29 is to extend to Assam the powers of detention, surveillance, and search which are at present enjoyed by the Bengal Government,, and are designed to deal with dangerous terrorists &quot;who cannot be dealt with in the Courts. There is not any proposal to extend the extraordinary powers conferred by the Bengal Suppression of Terrorist Outrages Act for instance, the powers to control traffic, impose curfew orders, control the movements of youths, &amp;c, which are in force in the Chittagong district. Nor is it proposed to take powers such as the Bengal Government is at present securing, which are designed to prevent, with the assistance of parents and guardians, the recruitment of young persons. The provisions of the Bill are directed entirely against individuals who are terrorists and who have actually committed or are suspected of intending to commit, terrorist crimes.   The ordinary life of the public will not be affected.Clause 30 is separate from the rest of the Bill. At present the All-India Press Act of 1931. prohibits the encouragement in the Press of murder or violence. Direct encouragement has ceased, but indirect encouragement (such as the adulation of individual terrorists and the praise of revolutionary ideas) continues in some Provinces. This clause is borrowed from this year&apos;s Bengal Bill, and prohibits (so far as Assam is concerned) the publication of matter which in the orjinion of the Local Government tends to create an atmosphere favourable to the gaining of adherents to the terrorist movement. The clause also prohibits the publication of the names of witnesses appearing in terrorist cases.
