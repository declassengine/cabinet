DOOUMEKT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHHIO majesty*S GOVERNMENT....... - -..... - (Copy No. c      -&quot; (54)cabinet. RUSSIAN TIMBER* Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,I attach, for the information of my colleagues, copies of letters which have passed between me and the High Commissioner for Canada on the subject of imports of Russian sawn softwood.     Following the receipt of tho observations of the Soviet Government on the Canadian representations ashing that Article 21 of the United Kingdom - Canadian Ottawa Agreement should be applied to Russian timber, discussions took place with Mr. Ferguson resulting in the arrangement set out in the correspondence.     This arrangement, which has been communicated to the interested parties, has made it unnecessary to ask the Import Duties Advisory Committee to proceed with their Inquiry into the matter.The ?fhite Sea Trust, the shippers, and. Timber Distributors Limited, the underwriting syndicate, are about to conclude a contract on the ba3i3 laid down, namely, that the maximum quantity of Russian sawn softwood should be limited to &apos;550,0O0 standards, as compared with the figure of 4&quot;5,000 standards previously proposed, and that the &quot;fall&quot; clauses-should be eliminated.   The price previously proposed was  2 a standard in excess of last year&apos;z opening prices, and the restriction to 350,000 standards will involve a further increase of about 10/- a standard.     The average price will therefore now be about  13.10s.0d. a standard.These arrangements will make it unnecessary for any formal steps to be taken under Section 5 of the Ottawale &quot;fall&quot; olause Is a olause tinder which the Russians agree to a reduction in the guaranteed price in the event of a fall in the price of certain competing Baltic woods.   The Canadian interests have always regarded this clause as depressing the market, and though there are grounds for regarding this view as mistaken, xt was thought better that this cause of complaint should be - eliminated.
2119V ju J*-Agreements Act;    such a proceeding might have been embarrassing in many ways.As 3oon as I know that the contract formalities are completed, I propose to make a statencnt in Parliament to the effect that, acting in the spirit of Article 21 of tho United Kingdom - Canadian Agreement, His Uajeaty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have informed the timber interests concerned that their provisional contract for Russian sawn softwood for 3934 3hould be modified on the linos indicated.Board of Trade,5th February, 1934&quot;
21223rd January, 1934.My dear Ferguoon,Since you wrote to me on the 6th December on the subject of Canadian Russian timber imports into this country, you will have received our memorandum of the 20th December.      In that memorandum it was stated that, with e view to consolidating end improving the position of Canadian timber in the United Kingdom market, and in order that there may be no question of their desire to act in the spirit of Article 21 of the United Kingdom-Canadian Agreement, H.M. Government in the United Kingdom would be willing to inform Timber Distributora ltd. , that the maximum quantity provided for in the proposed underwriting contract for sawn softwood must be reduced to 350,000 standards, on the understanding that this action is accepted by H.M. Government in Canada as providing adequate opportunities for Canadian suppliers in the United Kingdom market and as being therefore in conformity with the principle of Article 21 of the United Kingdom-Canadian Agreement.On the 17th January, you intimated your government&apos;s general agreement with the proposals in the memorandum but asked that consideration should be given to three points not specifically dealt with in the memorandum, namely, the ^fall&quot; clause, possible &quot;leakage&quot; through Finland and limitation of the quantity of Siberian pine.      I refer to these three points below.In view of that intimation, H.M. Government in the United Kingdom have informed Timber Distributors Ltd. that they wish the Company&apos;s proposed contract in respect of Russian sawn softwood for 1934 to be modified so as to reduce the maximum quantity to 350,000 standards.      Timber Distributors Ltd. have also been informed that H.M. GovernmentHon. G. Howard Ferguson, K. C, LL. D.
in the United Kingdom desire that the &quot;fall&quot; clause should be omitted from the 1934 contract.      The Company, for their part, accept this and will endeavour to arrange a contract in which the &quot;fall&quot; clsuse will not appear and in which the maximum quantity will not be more than 350,000 standards,,As regards &quot;leakage&quot;, there is a normal trade in Russian timber, mainly legs, --vhich, after undergoing further sawing in Finland and other adjoining countries, is exported to the United Kingdom.      This normal trade cannot, of course, be stopped by us;    but it is part of the proposed arrangement that there should not be evasion, and the position in this respect will be watched.      Timber Distributors Ltd. are equally interested in stopping evasion, and their provisional contract already contained a clause to this end.    S&apos;e can therefore rely on their co-operation.&apos;-vith regard to your request that, if possible, there should be some limitation of the quantity of Siberian pine provided for in the contract, Timber Distributors Ltd. anticipate no difficulty in arranging for a reduction of at least 2,500 standards in the maximum quantity contemplated in the provisional contract.I propose that a statement should be made (probably in reply to a House of Commons Question; to the effect that, acting in the spirit of Article 21 of the United Kingdom-Canadian Agreement, H.M. Government in the United Kingdom have informed the timber interests here that their provisional contract for Russian sawn softwood for 1954 should be modified in the way indicated above.Yours very sincerely,(civilian.)    Walter Runcimon.
CANADA HOUSE,TRAFALGAR SQUARE, LONDON, S.iff.1.29th January, 1934.Dear Mr. Runciman,In acknowledging your letter of the 23rd January, I am Instructed by the Prime Minister of Canada to inform you that the Government of Canada notes with satisfaction that His Majesty1s Government in the United Kingdom have informed Timber Distributors, Limited, that the maximum quantity of Russian sawn softwood to bo supplied under their contract for the year 1934 must not exceed 350,000 standards, thereby affording to Canadian timber exporters to the United Kingdom market increased opportunity for fair competition in general conformity with the principles underlying Article XXI of the United Kingdom-Canada Agreement.The canadian  Government further note, with satisfaction, that the &quot;Fall&quot; clause Is to be eliminated from the agreement between the Soviet Government and Timber listributors Limited. They ask me to emphasise to you that their acceptance of this arrangement Is based upon the assumption that Its terms will be strictly complied with by the contracting parties, and that no evasion will be permitted whereby Russian sawn softwood will find its way into the British market by channels, direct or indirect, other than through Timber Distributors, Limited, and thereby nullify the effects and purposes of that contract. His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada accept with great satisfaction the undertaking of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in that respect.I am further instructed to express to you the appreciation of the Canadian Government of the   efforts *f His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to bring about an adjustment of the difficulties that have arisen by reason of the Importation
of Russian timber into the United Kingdom, and the expression of your desire to maintain alike the intent and spirit of Article XXI of the United Kingdom-Canada Agreement.It is to be hoped that the reduction of the quantity of Siberian pine to be imported under the contract by 2,500 standards will afford a reasonable opportunity for Canadian white pine to find a place In this market.Very sincerely yours,(SGD.)    G.H. FERGUSON,Right Honourable Walter Runciman, M.P., Board of Trade,Great George Street, S.W.1.
