TS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT.Copy No. ^.P. 6(34)CABINET.COAL MINES ACT. 1930.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate, for the consideration of my colleagues, a memorandum by the Secretary for Mines, recommending the immediate introduction of a Bill to amend Part I of the Coal Mines Act, 1930.W.R.Board of Trade,1st February, 1934.
PART 1 OF THIS COAL MINES ACT, 1930.Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines.1. On the 23rd March last it was announced in the House of Commons with Cabinet authority that the policy rf His Majesty&apos;s Government was that the Central Scheme in force under Part I of the Coal Mines Act, 1930, must be amended so as to provide for separate inland and export allocations and for inter-diBtrict co-ordination of minimum prices, and that, failing satisfactory assurances from the Central Council of Colliery Owners by the middle of April that these amendments would be submitted for approval, the Government would take the earliest opportunity of proposing legislation to give the Board of Trade general powers to amend the Central Scheme in order that these amendments might be made.      Since that announcement the Central Council have continued their efforts to reaoh agreement with regard to the submission of amendments, but without avail.     These efforts have now been in progress for twenty months, but I learn from Mr. Evan Williams, the Chairman of the Council, that there is no prospect of reaching within a reasonable time such a measure of agreement on any one of the proposals before the Council as would secure a majority of 85 per cent, which, by the terms of the Central Scheme, is necessary before amendments can be submitted to me for approval.2. I think that the time has come when definite decisions with regard to the future of Part I must be taken.      The possible lines of action, as I see them, are three:-3. By passing the Coal Mines Act, 1932, which extended the life of Part I for five years, the Government accepted that the Act was essential for the well-being of the industry.     In February last I expressed the view, after a careful examinationcertain respects.
of the working of the Schemes and of the criticisms that had been levelled against them, that it was essential that they should continue in force.      I am still strongly of that opinion.In spite of the present differences within the industry with regard to the amendment of Part I, there han been no move towards its revocation.     Mr. iivan Williams has assured me that an overwhelming majority of the coal owners consider that Part I must be retained.      With few exceptions, the coal owners who have constituted the recent deputations to me from the districts have expressed a similar view.      It is also the policy of the Miners1 Federation.The economic and social effects which would ensue on the revooation of Part I cannot be over-emphasised.     Although its operation has tended to maintain wholesale coal prices at a time v/hen other commodity prices have been falling, the financial position of the industry remains bad.      Its productive capacity is still greatly in excess of any demand that can be reasonably foreseen.      Unleashing that excess capacity would result in a severe fall in prices whioh the finances of the industry could not bear, and would lead inevitably to attacks on wages.      In the absence of statutory regulation of outimt and prices, extensive cut-throat competition would undoubtedly oe embarked upon.      Part I has enabled the available employment in the industry to be spread among the greatest possible number of men.      If it were revoked, the available employment would be concentrated, and I estimate that there would be an addition of nearly 150,000 to the number of workpeople totally unemployed.The Coal Mines Act, 1950, acts as a buffer between the Government and economic and industrial strife in the coal industry.      If it were revoked, the wages of the workmen could, of course, be safeguarded by providing by Act of Parliament that the present minimum basic rates of wages
should remain in force until, say, the end of 1937.     Such a proposal would safeguard the wages of the men who remained in employment, hut it would not prevent that increase in the number of miners totally unemployed to which I have already referred.     Moreover,  it i3 certain that the adoption of such a course in the mining industry would be followed by applications from the workmen in other industries for similar statutory protection.     The policy would be strenuously opposed by the coal owners and by industrialists generally.4. I submit that to permit Part I to remain unamended is also very dangerous, and would probably lead gradually to the same economic and social results as if Part I were revoked.     The Cabinet decision which preceded the announcement of Government policy in the House in March last was made at a time when our negotiations for trade agreements with the Scandinavian countries were approaching conclusion.      we were being pressed by the Scandinavian delegations to give assurances that the necessary supplies of coal would be available if they guaranteed to take certain quantities from Great Britain.     The delegations were not satisfied with the assurances that the British coal trade were prepared to give;    they regarded the existence of statutory regulation of output as an obstacle to the fulfilment of those assurances.     The announcement in the House was therefore brought to their notice, and it was made clear to them during the discussions that coal for export would be virtually freed from quantitative control.     No undertakings of this nature were either incorporated in the agreements or covered by an exchange of letters.     The manner
in which we carry out the agreements is our domestic concern.nevertheless, there is no doubt that the scandinavian government expect something to be done in the matter.Indeed, it is already clear, although the agreements havebeen in force only a few months, that Scandinavian buyerswill urge that the existence of the quota system in itspresent form lias prevented them from obtaining from GreatBritain all the coal that they have undertaken to buyhere, ,md that they are consequently entitled to a reductionof the percentage prescribed under the agreements.If overseas demands are to be met under the presentsystem of regulation, the allocations to the exportingdistricts must be on such a generous scale that inevitablymore coal will be available for the inland market than it requires.    Sir Adam, tfimmo, who, from being an opponent ofPart I, has become a supporter, states the position veryappositely in a private letter:-&quot;So long as there is a single allocation which covers even a portion of the export requirements there will always be a throw-back of export coal on the inland market and the inland price will continue to be depressed so long as the potential output is in excess of the demand as it must inevitably be in the existing circumstances.&quot;Then there is the question of evasions of minimum prices, the number of v/hich is increasing to the serious detriment of the financial position of the industry.   Many Executive Boards are anxious to deal with this problem, but they are unwilling to take isolated action as they fear that others may not follow suit.    It is difficult for an Executive Board to maintain its authority when the coal owners of the district know that, by reason of their observance of minimum prices, they are being under-cut by coal owners in another district,
whose minimum prices ii^vo been fixed at an unduiy low level, Fer the mgment th^re Is no redress against a district which adopts this latter course.     By giving the Central Council power to co-ordin^tt the minimum prices of the various districts and to penalise a district for the non-observance of its rulings, much of the suspicion which now exists will disappear and with it some of the incentive to evade.5. I favour th-   third possible course - that the Government by legislation should make the necessary amendments in Part I * of the 1930 Act.    For twenty months the coal industry has discussed this problem.    It is clear, and the deputations from the coal owners that I hav* seen during the past few weeks have only served to confirm, that the interests of the various coal mining districts so conflict, notably in regard to their respective shares in the inland markets, that it Is hopeless to expsct them to take a national as opposed to a local attitude in regard to amendments.   The coal owners in the exporting districts consider that no amendment of the Act is necessaryj they point to the assurances that have been given by the Central Council that ample allocations will be given to the exporting districts in order to enable increased demands from abroad to be met.      They claim that thesr assurances are sufficient,    alternatively, they suggest that a system of export pools should be constituted from which collieries with additional export trade will be abla to obtain additional quota.    The exporting districts admit frankly that during the period of depression in exporting business their colleeries havw mads inroads into the inland markets.    While anxious to
develop their export trade, they desire that their present freedom to take advantage of favourable inland markets should remain unimpaired.On the other hand, the inland districts desire protection from the continuation of the competition to which they have been subjected by the exporting districts during the past few years.      They point out (and Mr. Evan &quot;Williams has made the same point) that giving unrestricted allocations to the exporting districts inevitably means at the same time flooding the inland markets with coal that they cannot absorb, the result being a decline in prices.     There is a marked difference between realisable prices of coal in exporting markets and in homo markets, coupled with a greater reduction in demand for export than at home.      This condition makes the home market a point of attack to the exporting districts.The inland districts object to a system of export pools unless safeguards are incorporated in it which will prevent any further expansion of the exporting districts&apos; trade in inland markets.      The exporting districts regard these safeguards as making the export pool scheme entirely unworkable, and I think they are probably right in this.60 Part I of the Goal Mines Act, 1930, conferred on the coal industry unique powers, which should, indeed, have enabled it to Improve its financial position.      These powers have not been utilised as wisely as they should have been,,    Instead of improving the condition of the industry they have, up to the present, only served to prevent its financial position from becoming worse.     There i3 o substantial measure of agreement in the industry with regard to two amendments which should tend towards a proper fulfilment of the objects of the Act, viz.  separate allocations for the inland and export trade and inter--district co-ordination of minimum prices.     Although
over 60 per cent, of the industry is in favour of &quot;them, it is not surprising,  in an individualistic industry like the coal Industry, that the majority of 85 per cent., which, under the terms of the Central Scheme,  is necessary for the incorporation of the amendments in that Scheme, cannot be secured.     But if the coal industry cannot help itself, it seems to me that in respect of separate allocations for the Inland and export trade and inter-district co-ordination of minimum prices - and in these two respects only - the Government must carry out the policy that it announced In March last and assist the Industry by introducing an amending Bill.     For that reason, I think that it is better not to confer general powers of amendment of the Central Scheme upon the Board of Trade, as was suggested in March last, but to restrict the Bill to the specific amendments that I have indicated.     I propose, Indeed, that In one respect there shall be a little more freedom.     From a practical point of view there is not a great deal of difference between virtual and actual freedom of export from output regulation;    but the latter course affords a complete answer to the allegations by the Scandinavians that difficulties In securing supplies cf British coal are due to the quota system.     It also goes a long way towards meeting the criticism of shippers and exporters who have been the most persistent and vocal opponents of Part I. I think, therefore, that it is better to give the export trade entire freedom from quantitative control rather than have separate allocations for this side of the trade.7.    The industry has now reached a stage when the further consideration of amendments by the Central Council is a mere pretence.     The various groups of districts havo, in turn, sent deputations to sf3e me to urge their separate points of view. It is clear from what those deputations have said that the coalowners now expect the Government itself to amend Part I. The threat by the Government in March last to confer on the Board of Trade general powers to- amend the Schemes failed to
reconcile the differences between the districts.     Those differences are so fundamental that I have little hope that the actual introduction of a Bill would reconcile them.     I am certain that a repetition of the threat to introduce a Bill would make no impression whatever on the   coalowners.      In the meantime in view of the uncertainty of the position, the administration of the Schemes under Part I is suffering.8.    I submit, therefore, that authority should be given for the introduction, at the earliest possible date, of the draft Bill to amend Part I that has been prepared.     A copy of this Bill is attached.E.B.1st February, 1934.Mines Department.
