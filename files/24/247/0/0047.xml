Copy No.CP. 47 (34).CABINET.Produce Markets Supply  Committee.REPORT ON THE MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS SITUATION.1. THE Produce Markets Supply Committee of the Cabinet, which was set up on the 29th November, 1933 (Cabinet 66 (33) Conclusion 7), has had under consideration memoranda by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries on the market situation regarding (1) beef, and (2) milk and dairy produce (P.M.S. (33) 2 and 3)2. The beef situation, being a matter of greater urgency, was considered first. The action recommended by the Committee was approved by the Cabinet on the 20th December (Cabinet 70 (33), Conclusion 10), and has been duly taken. See statement by Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in House of Commons on the 20th December, 1933, and the Cattle (Import Regulation) Order, 1933, subsequently made by the Board of Trade.3. The Committee are now in a position to make recommendations to the Cabinet in regard to milk and milk products. It is inherent in the nature of the industry that there should be a quantity of milk surplus to liquid requirements. This surplus has represented little short of 20 per cent, of the total quantity of milk sold under contract this winter, and the proportion is likely to be over 40 per cent, of the larger volume of contract supplies available in the spring and summer.4. The surplus has to find a market in manufactured form, chiefly as butter and cheese. Low prices for butter and cheese mean low values for surplus milk and affect the income of every producer. The prices of home-manufactured butter and cheese are determined by the prices of imported supplies. Imports have increased enormously in recent years, much of the increase being attributable to imports from Dominion sources. Prices are at record low levels and seem likely to deteriorate further under the pressure of supplies. It is clear that when the spring and summer flush of milk comes on to the market the price structure of the whole dairying industry in this country will be seriously undermined.5. Under the Ottawa Agreements Act, we are debarred from any regulation of Dominion imports until August 1935. Attempts have been made during the past year, including discussions with the High Commissioners in London, with Dominion Ministers at the Economic Conference, and a visit of the Chairman of the English Milk Board to New Zealand, to come to some arrangement with the Dominions for the voluntary regulation of their exports to this market, but all efforts have so far failed. Accordingly, measures to deal with the immediate situation are necessary.6. It is clearly desirable that as large a proportion as possible of the United Kingdom supply of milk should be consumed in liquid form, the more so because our consumption of liquid milk is low per head of population. It is, however, impossible to transform at short notice the habits of the consumers, and further-more there is a certain amount of distrust felt as to the purity of milk in this country.7.   We recommend to the Cabinet the following proposals : (1) A price-security arrangement to ensure, by means of repayable advances from the Exchequer, minimum returns to the English and Scottish Milk Marketing Boards in respect of milk manufactured in factories and into cheese on farms.[9643] b
It is proposed that (i) By means of repayable advances from public funds, and for the twoyears beginning the 1st April, 1934, the Milk Marketing Boards should be guaranteed minimum prices of 5d. per gallon in summer (April-September), and (id. per gallon in winter, in respect of milk manufactured in factories in Great Britain.(ii) For the same period, the Milk Marketing Boards should receive thesame amount of repayable advance per gallon of milk manufactured into cheese on farms in Great Britain as accrues to them in respect of milk manufactured into cheese in factories.(iii) The rate per gallon of the advance to the Boards should be at a uniformrate, determined monthly, and should equal the excess of the minimum price per gallon of milk over the price per lb. of imported cheese, less lfd*(iv) The sums advanced should be repaid under the arrangement in (v)below, during the two years from the 1st April, 1936, to the 31st March, 1938 any outstanding balance at the latter date to be finally accepted as a charge on public funds, (v) The rate per gallon of the repayment during the two years commencing the 1st April, 1936, should be determined monthly, and should equal the excess of the price per lb. of imported cheese (defined as in the footnote to (iii) above), over Qd. per gallon in summer and Id. per gallon in winter. Thus, the areas between 5d. and Qd. in summer and Qd. and Id. in winter would be &quot;neutral zones,&quot; in which repayment would be excused.(2) The provision from public funds of a sum not exceeding  750,000, spread over the next four years, for the purpose of launching an efficient campaign for securing a purer milk supply. It will be the responsibility of the Boards to continue the campaign as soon as they are in a position to do so.(3) A contribution from the Exchequer on a   for   basis to a Milk Publicity Fund for a period of two years. It is unlikely that the contribution from the Exchequer would exceed &amp;\ million in the first year, and it should be limited to &amp;\ million in any year, according to the amount contributed by the Milk Marketing Boards; the grant to be contingent on the submission of an approved programme containing, inter alia, provision for the supply of milk to schools at reduced rates.8. In putting forward these proposals, which are set out in greater detail in the annexed Report of an Inter-departmental Committee, we wish to emphasise strongly the point raised by Sir Horace Wilson in his covering note that these suggestions are made to meet the immediate needs of the situation, on the assump-tion that the Milk Marketing Boards should be or as quickly as possible should become self-supporting. We also attach considerable importance to the recommendation in paragraph 21 of the Report, and agree that very careful consideration should be given by the Agricultural Departments and the Milk Boards to the possibility of controlling over-production, should such take place.v; 9/ In connection with the supply of milk to school-children at reduced rates, we appreciate that it is important to avoid conceding a principle which Avould lead to demands on the Exchequer for grants for other services. It will be seen that the form of our recommendation overcomes this difficulty.10. Legislation will be necessary to give effect to these proposals, but, in view of the widespread interest which is being taken in the milk problem, there is every reason to hope that it will be favourably received.11. It is recognised that the details of the proposals, which concern several Departments, will need elaboration. This will be undertaken as soon as authority is giyep, by,the pabinet, to, fcheftproposals.r(i-jTJfe,,PQ^u^ijiteye. 1&apos;^p^nm^no1, that,fthe.

THE MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS   SITUATION.Report of Sir Horace Wilson&apos;s Committee.Chancellor of the Exchequer. Secretary of State for the Dominions. President of the Board of Trade. Minister of Agriculture.I ATTACH the Report of the Committee on the Milk&quot; Situation (Sir Frederick Phillips, Mr. A. W. Street, Sir Geoffrey Whiskard, Mr. Carlill and myself). In making suggestions to meet the immediate needs of the situation, we have proceeded on the assumption that the Milk Boards should be or as quickly as possible should become self-supporting. We think this is of the utmost importance, not merely from the point of view of the Exchequer, but in order to impress upon the Boards a full.sense of their responsibility, while at the same time strengthening them as against their constituents.&apos;(Initialled) H. J. W.The Milk and Milk Products   Situation.1. In drawing up the proposals described below for dealing with the situation in the milk industry in Great Britain (disclosed in the memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture dated the 7th December, 1933, P.M.S. (33), 3, and discussed at the meeting of the Produce Markets Supply Committee on the 18th December, P.M.S. (33), 4th Cons.), it has been assumed that the consumer must be saved the burden of increased prices for liquid milk and that the income of the industry must be maintained at such a level as will preserve the milk marketing schemes.Position of the Dominions.(a) Quantitative Regulations.2. The Ministers memorandum shows that the present low value of &quot;manufacturing&quot; milk is, in fact, a threat to the continuance of the schemes. The main source of trouble is the low level of prices of butter and cheese, imports of which come largely from the Dominions. It is essential, therefore, to secure the collaboration of the Dominions in measures designed to place and to keep our dairy industry in a position which the Government can regard as satisfactory. It will probably be found necessary to secure some limitation on Dominion supplies to this market. The Dominions would not like such a limitation, and they would almost certainly ask what is our long-term plan. If it is not yet practicable to indicate the scope of the whole of our agricultural policy, it seems possible to go some way to reassure the Dominions so far as regards milk products. We should not be able to give a full statement, showing precisely the degree to which we desire that our home milk industry should expand, for some time; our long-term plan for milk could only be prepared after an exhaustive investigation lasting some months and adequate information on which it could b&amp; basbd ^ijni$tvbb&apos;,aVfiiUHle&apos;&apos;vhiiliil(&apos;towards the end of tijis^y^r^whe^fi the fust  Welve&apos;monthsof &apos;the milk marketing&apos; sbn&apos;eme&apos;sr operations&apos; will have been completed.3. Care will need to be taken in deciding at what moment to approach the Dominions. They might be willing to co-operate without waiting for the expiry of the relevant provisions of the Ottawa Agreements (eighteen months from now) if we were prepared at this stage to make it clear that, while resorting to emergency measures to avoid a collapse in the spring of this year, our policy is [9643] b 2
to ensure only the maintenance (or, at most, a reasonable expansion) of our present cheese and butter production, and that we are willing to examine with them ways of assuring that their supplies to this market should expand when demand expands. If, however, we make this declaration now we may be giving away a bargaining counter that might be much more effective if used when we get nearer to August 1935. Moreover, prices for butter and cheese on this market are likely to fall still further during the next three or four months, and this further fall may induce the Dominions to approach us (and possibly Denmark and other foreign suppliers), and in that event our negotiating position would, of course, be greatly strengthened. It is improbable that, if we were to approach the Dominions at once, their agreement to any measures we propose would be forthcoming in time to help to deal with the immediate crisis which will come in March or April.4. On the other hand, there is no need to wait until the relevant provisions of the Ottawa Agreements have almost run out. Suggestions might well be made to the Dominions (as soon as circumstances are favourable for discussing the point with them) with a view to improving the situation pending the expiry of those provisions in August 1935. In the light of the results of this discussion, further suggestions could be made to deal with the position after August 1935, the object being, if possible, to avoid imposing restrictions upon them against their will after August 1935 a course which might well have serious reper-cussions upon the whole of our relations, economic and political, with the Dominions.(b) The Levy Scheme.5. In the Ministers memorandum (paragraph 5) it is suggested that overseas Governments might possibly prefer an &quot;equalisation levy&quot; on their butter and cheese (if accompanied by a corresponding levy on home-produced supplies) to the quantitative regulation of their butter and cheese supplies to this market. It seems unlikely that the Dominions would agree to such a levy, at any rate now. They may well be in a different frame of mind in the spring, when they will be suffering still more severely from the effects upon prices of an overloading of the market for which they are largely responsible. If, however, they were induced to agree, reluctantly, to a levy now, they would probably attribute their troubles in the spring to the levy instead of to their unwillingness hitherto to co-operate in remedial measures, and consequently be less willing to collaborate in the working out of our long-term plan for milk. It should also be borne in mind that the levy could not be imposed without the consent of foreign countries, as our trade agreement with Denmark conventionalises the butter duty at 15s. per cwt.; Denmark would probably suggest that we should use, for the purpose in view, some of the 15s. duty.6. Even if the Dominions were ready later on to accept the levy scheme as an alternative to quantitative regulation, there would still remain the political objections here both to a levy which would be, in effect, a customs duty and to a corresponding levy upon milk products produced at home. Nevertheless, from the consumer&apos;s point of view, the levy scheme would be a cheaper method of securing a substantial increase in home producers&apos; returns than that of raising the prices of the total supply of milk products through quantitative control when so large a proportion of that supply is imported.Proposals for Repayable Advances.7.   This Committee&apos;s proposals for the immediate future are as follows :  (1) By means of repayable advances from public funds and for the two years beginning the 1st April, .1934,; the IVIilk marketing boards ; ;        ^should be guaranteed ^i^inimuhi^pnce^ of 5d/per /^ilpiirift^siam&amp;er 1     (April-September) and 6ch per &quot;gallon in winter in respect of milk manufactured in factories in Great Britain. (2) For the same period, the Milk Marketing Boards should receive the same amount of repayable advance per gallon of milk manufactured into cheese on farms in Great Britain as accrues to them in respect of milk manufactured into cheese in factories.
(3) The rate per gallon of the advance to the Boards should be at a uniform rate determined monthly and should equal the excess of the minimum price per gallon of milk over the price per lb. of imported cheese, less lfd.*(5) The sums advanced should be repaid under the arrangement in (5) below, during the two years from the 1st April, 1936, to the 31st March, 1938 any outstanding balance at the latter date to be finally accepted as a charge on public funds.(5) The rate per gallon of the repayment during the two years commencing the 1st April, 1936, should be determined monthly, and should equal the excess of the price per lb. of imported cheese (defined as in the footnote to (3) above, over 6d. per gallon in summer and 7d. in winter. Thus, the areas between 3d. and 6d. in summer and 6d. and 7d. in winter would be &quot; neutral zones&quot; in which repayment would be excused.An example, illustrating the method of operation of these proposals, is appended.8. The suggested minimum summer price of 5d. may be regarded by farmers as unduly low, but it is unlikely that the present request for assistance would have been made had the value of manufacturing milk as indicated by the price of imported cheese remained at that figure. There is, moreover, a precedent for it; in the negotiations between producers and distributors in 1932, prices were fixed as usual on an imported cheese price basis, but were subject to a guaranteed minimum of 5d. The higher price of 6^. is suggested for winter (when costs of production are higher) in order to make the plan more attractive to the producers. The summer production of manufacturing milk is almost three times the winter production, so that the average minimum price for twelve months would be 5^d.9. The quantity of milk covered by this plan would, it is estimated, be from 160 to 180 million gallons, and, assuming an average rate of advance of 2d. per gallon in summer and 3d. per gallon in winter (the price per lb. of imported cheese under paragraph 7 (3) above will probably be in the region of 3d. in April next), the total advances in the first year would be about  1-1 million. The total advances might well be much less in the second year owing to a rise in imported cheese prices due to a change in world conditions or to the measures we may be able to take in conjunction with overseas suppliers. Indeed, there is a distinct possibility that the realisation value of manufacturing milk would be in excess of the guaranteed minimum price before the 1st April, 1936; but it seems reasonable to defer the commencement of the repayment period&quot; until then and also to provide the &quot; neutral zones &quot; mentioned in paragraph 7 (5) above so as to give the industry a chance to recuperate from the present price situation. It seems reasonable also that the industry should be relieved from all liability under the plan at the end of four years.10. This scheme does not provide for milk manufactured into butter on farms. Such milk is potentially less mobile than farm cheese milk, owing to the association of butter-making on the farm with stock-raising. It constitutes a much smaller danger to the financial stability of Milk Marketing Schemes, and may be disregarded. The salvation of the farm butter-makers lies, not so much in receiving regional milk pool prices as in better prices for dairy cows, and in a rise in the beef market leading to improved prices for store cattle. The most likely .effect of their exclusion will be an increase in creamery butter manufacture  a move which, in view of the poor quality of much farm butter, is to be welcomed.11. In practice, no demand for further assistance would normally arise in respect of milk manufactured into cream, condensed milk, milk powder or ^m^W^^HfcfP^^fe^&apos; fpi&apos; the ;domestxc market, , A measure! of:,, quantitative regulation lias.&apos; Been applied ^^^^^;&apos;\iQi%.tii^eproducts, arid &quot;production for home consumption is already bringing to the Milk Marketing Boards a value considerably higher than would be the case if the milk so utilised were handled* The price to be the average wholesale price per lb. of New Zealand Finest White and Finest Canadian W hiti- less lfrZ. per lb. to cover the cost of manufacture. Une gallon of milk makes on the aveiage 1 lb. of cheese.
in cheese or butter factories. It is essential that the English and Scottish Boards* should obtain the same prices in disposing ,of their milk for the manufacture of these products. Continuous trouble will be inevitable if these antonomous Boards are free to fix competing prices for the milk sold for these products.12. It is thought that this scheme of repayment advances would be open to less serious criticism from the business world than a scheme for a subsidy. It would, of course, mean a charge on the Votes and would involve legislation.13. The Minister of Agriculture has urged, in addition to a price security arrangement, measures (a) to secure purer milk by a campaign to clean-up the herds, and(b) to develop the milk-drinking habit through an extension of the &quot; milk in schools&apos;&apos; movement.Cleaning-up of Herds.14. The Grigg Commission recommended the appointment of a whole-time veterinary service to ensure that the requirements of the Milk and Dairies Order and of the Tuberculosis Order are efficiently carried out. (It is understood that in England and Wales only 6 of the 59 county authorities with powers in this matter have appointed whole-time veterinary officers; about 300 such officers are required for the inspection of the national herd.) The Commission estimated that the additional cost involved when the scheme is in full operation, would be at the rate of about  200,000 a year for England and Wales the figure, allowing for contingencies, might be  300,000 for Great Britain and they recommended substantial assistance from public funds. It is understood that the Gowland-Hopkins Committee of the Economic Advisory Council will shortly report strongly in favour of a scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.15. Until the Milk Boards were set up, the cost of a service of this character would have had to be borne by public funds; but now that the industry is organised on a monopolistic basis, there is a strong case for the expenditure being made a charge on the industry. It is hardly reasonable, however, to ask the Milk Marketing Boards to find the money while they are faced with their present difficulties. It is proposed, therefore, that a sum not exceeding  750,000, spread over the next four years, should be provided from public funds to launch an efficient campaign for cleaning-up the herds. (It is anticipated that it would not be possible to put this service into full operation at the outset, and the figure of  300,000 a year would not, therefore, be spent in the first two or three years.) It would, of course, be the responsibility of the Boards to continue the campaign as soon as they are in a position to do so. In the meantime, action on the above lines could be justified on the ground that the purity of milk is the joint concern of the general public, and of the dairy industry. It appears to be common ground that the cleaning-up of the herd is an urgently required reform, Mnd it does.not appear to be necessary to wait for the report of the Gowland-Hopkins Committee before deciding on the step recommended above.Milk in Schools.16. The proposal to extend the &quot;milk in schools &quot; movement at the cost of the taxpayer raises issues beyond the competence of this Committee; but it is recommended that, if anything is to be done on these lines, it should only be as part of a wider publicity campaign for the development of the milk-drinking habit. At present, about 8 million gallons of milk a year are consumed in schools in England and Wales, mainly at the cost of the parents. For this milk, the Milk Board at present realises Is. Id. per gallon on the average. If it were made Available; at &amp;M- per gallon (the&quot;average guaranteed;-price; proposed for injariu-f acthfihg milk-paragraphs: 7 and 8)&apos;, the result would &quot;be a&apos; loss&apos; of&apos;&apos; revenue to the English Milk Board alone of  J million (8 million gallons dropping nearly 8d. per gallon in price), and this loss would be increased in proportion to the increase* The present Scottish Milk Marketing Board only covers the area south of the Grampians. A scheme is at present before Parliament for the creation of a Milk Board in the Aberdeen area, comprising the counties of Aberdeen and Kincardine.
in milk consumption in schools which the lower price would bring about. It appears that the &quot; milk in schools &quot; movement aims at a five or six-fold increase; if a four-fold increase were secured in this way, the loss to the English Board would be about  1 million a year.17. The milk industry, in ordinary circumstances, should be expected to bear the cost of a milk publicity campaign in the same way as other industries pay for their campaigns to push sales. In present circumstances, however, having regard to the financial difficulties confronting the Milk Boards, some assistance seems needed to enable the industry to launch a publicity campaign. The Exchequer and the industry might therefore contribute on a   for   basis to a milk publicity fund. The Exchequer grant might amount to about    million, according to the amount contributed by the Boards; it should not exceed  1 million a year and the period covered should be two years. Any grant so made should be contingent on the Boards putting forward a publicity programme of which the Government approve, and on the programme containing, inter alia, provision for all milk supplied to school children being made available by the Boards at not more than (say) the price guaranteed for manufacturing milk under the repayable-advances plan. As in the case of the cleaning-up of the herds, the responsibility for continuing the publicity campaign on these lines should rest entirely on the Milk Boards when the Exchequer grants cease.Future of the Milk Marketing Schemes.18. Under the milk marketing schemes, the farmer has a, guaranteed market for all the milk he cares to produce for sale, and he can be sure of receiving the pool price for it. Provided this price is remunerative, he has consequently every incentive to produce milk, since, in practice, he is largely relieved of all anxiety regarding its disposal. It is true that the English Board have power to charge a commission of \d. per gallon on unsold milk which they take over, but even this small item is not being charged at present, because the Board have, so far, not had to buy unsold dairies. The transfer from the individual farmer to the Board for the responsibility for finding a market is probably inseparable from a scheme of this kind; but its consequences may be serious, unless the Board can find some way of controlling production.19. This might be done (a) by paying a proportionately lower rate per gallon for manufacturing milk than for liquid milk; or (b) by some form of direct control of production, so that a producer who delivered milk in excess of an assigned quota would receive for the excess a price decidedly below the regional pool price. The absence of any check on over-production may easily prove in practice to have more serious consequences than those feared from an attempt to restrict production. Moreover, the Government is vitally interested in the matter. A breakdown in the milk schemes through over-production would be very serious. Expanding production would lead to continual pressure by the industry on the Government to exclude more and more Dominion and foreign&apos; products in a manner possibly very injurious to the national interests.20. One serious practical, though temporary, difficulty in the way of regulating production must be stated. No adequate statistics of use for control purposes will be available until after the end of the first year&apos;s working of the Milk Boards the 30th September in the case of England and Wales and the 30th November in the case of Scotland. Premature discussion of these questions would involve a serious risk that production would be immediately expanded wherever possible since the farmers are well aware that the statistics of the present twelve months will be the only possible basis for computing quotas.21.   This Committee recommend, however that very careful consideration give^ by,&apos;the/ Department&apos;of Agriculture in Scotland and the Milk Boards to the possibility of controlling over-production, should such take place, and that the necessary statistics for examination of this question should be prepared as soon as practicable after the completion of the Board&apos;s first year of operations. In the meantime, the English Board should be asked to consider the advisability of having recourse to their power of charging a commission of \d. per gallon on unsold milk which
they take over. The Scottish Board should consider the advisability of seeking an amendment of their scheme to obtain the same power. The announcement of assistance by the Government would be a convenient opportunity for the Boards to make a move in this direction.(Signed) H. J. WILSON (Chairman).(Signed) H.
