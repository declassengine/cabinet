(1) COMPULSORY INSURANCE AGAINST THIRD PARTY RISKS IN RESPECT OFHSEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY.(2) ROAD TRAFFIC (COMPENSATION FOR ACCIDENTS) BILL.(?) ROAD TRAFFIC (EMERGENCY TREATMENT) BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.In my recent Memorandum on road accidents (CP. 312(33.), I stated that I proposed to circulate a further memorandum deal-ing with certain amendments of the existing law relating to compulsory insurance against third party risks in respect of personal injury or death in motor accidents.     The matter was dealt with very briefly in my earlier memorandum CP. 296(33) on the Road Traffic (Compensation for Accidents) Bill and the Road Traffic (Emergency Treatment) Bill.2.      In the latter memorandum I mentioned in particular the desirability of amending, as regards motor accidents, the general principle of law that in questions of tort right of action abates on the death of the negligent party (actio personalis moritur cum persona).      The Attorney General in an appendix to my memorandum supported this suggestion.     He pointed out that a good deal of injustice is caused by the operation of this legal maxim and that no real Injustice would be caused by its abrogation in this particular case.Apart from cases where the motorist is killed outright and consequently no claim can be made by the injured party,  it is at present possible for an unscrupulous  insurance company to delay settlement of the claim, in the hope that the motorist who may have been severely injured will die before the claim can be settled.3.     A number of cases of hardship have been brought to my notice due to repudiation of liability by an insurance company on account of misrepresentation by the assured in the proposal form,IsECRET.CAB I N E T.[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GO VT5RMJENT).COPY NO. ft?:.....
Z 8or on account of the breach of some condition attached to the policy.     While it is clearly impossible to cover all cases where a motor vehicle is used outside the terms of the policy (for example when it is driven by an unauthorised person) there can be no doubt that some of the less reputable insurance companies not infrequently repudiate liability on grounds whichhave no material bearing on the accident.      It is by this and similar means that such companies are able to quote exception-ally low premiums end thereby attract business.I propose to provide that if a certificate of insurance has been issued by an insurrnce company, which purports to cover the driver in the circumstances of the particular accident,  it should not be open to the insurance company to repudiate liability in respect of claims for personal injury or death arising under the Act,  on the ground of misrepresentation or non-disclosure in the proposal form. Such a proposal may be represented as being at variance with the principles governing the ordinary law of contract, but the .position as regards motor accidents seems to me fundamentally altered by the fact that Parliament has made insurance against third party risks compulsory in respect of death or injury.      This step was taken to protect the injured third party and must therefore to a certain extent affect the freedom of contract between the assurer and the assured. Section 112 of the Road Traffic Act,  1930* provides severe penalties if a person knowingly makes a false statement or withholds any material information for the purpose of obtaining a certificate of insurance,2f.      I have already pointed out that it is not in general possible to cover cases where the motor Vehicle is used outside the actual conditions of the policy.     There is one condition however which offers opportunities for evasion to the less reputable companies.     Most motor policies contain a condition to the effect that the company shall not be liable if the motor
vehicle is driven in an unsafe or damaged condition i.e.  if the vehicle has not teen properly maintained and is not roadworthy. Gases of repudiation have been brought to my notice where defective maintenance has been put forward as a reason for repudiation though the particular defect in maintenance may have had no bearing on the accident.     It is for consideration whether a condition of this nature should not be made void.5.      I am of opinion,  further, that in the case of liabilities in respect of personal injury or death, which the Statute requires shall be covered by insurance, there should if necessary be a direct remedy against the insurance company.     At present it is only open to the injured party to proceed against the negligent motorist and he has no guarantee that the insurance company will assume liability either for compensation or for the costs of the action.     If the driver of the vehicle is a man of straw and the insurance company for some reason refuses to pay, the only remedy open to the injured person is to proceed against the driver and make him bankrupt, after which event he can prosecute his claim against the insurance company under the Third Parties,  (Rights Against Insurers) Act,6.     Suggestions have been made in many quarters that the deposit of fifteen thousand pounds required to be made with the Supreme Court under Section 2j-2 of the Road Traffic Act, 19^0, by a company undertaking motor insurance business, should be substantially increased, and that the deposit should be earmarked for the satisfaction of outstanding claims if the insurancs company is wound up.      The Board of Trade have been consulted and are disposed to regard any substantial increase as wrong in principle and open to objection in practice.     A deposit of twenty thousand pounds is required in respect of each other class of insurance, such as life, fire and employers&apos; liability.     A substantial increase in the amount of the deposit for motor insurance business would inevitably lead to a demand for
- ^ -corresponding increases in the other deposits with the result that a company would have an unreasonably large amount of capital locked up.     The deposit could not in any case &quot;be made so substantial as to cover all possible outstanding claims. There is the further point, which has been made by the insurance interests, that an increase of the deposit in this country might lead other countries to increase the deposit required from alien insurance companies as a condition of carrying on business in their territory.     The Board of Trade do not consider that there is a case for doing more than providing, when opportunity arises, for an increase in the deposit in respect of motor insurance business from fifteen thousand to twenty thousand pounds so as to bring it into conformity with the deposit required in other clssces of insurance business.The question whether the deposit in respect of motor insurance business should be earmarked for the satisfaction of outstanding claiias when an insurance company is wound up, stands on rather a different footing.     Even in the case of a comparatively small insurance company, outstanding claims would&quot; usually greatly exceed a deposit of even twenty thousand pounds and in the case of the larger companies would be entirely out of proportion to the amount of any reasonable deposit.     At the same time,  the proposal has its attractions and I am inclined t*J recommend amendment of the law in this direction7.     There are some further alterations in the machinery of compulsory insurance which might with advantage be made with a view to tightening up procedure and bringing the provisions of the Statute more directly to the notice of the users and owners of motor vehicles.     These, however, are of a minor character and it is not necessary for me to trouble the Cabinet with them.8. It will be necessary for me to consult representatives of the insurance interests before finally drafting my proposals. I seek authority to approach thorn on the basis that the
Government desires to see the following amendments made In the law relative to compulsory insurance against third party risks In respect of death, or -personal injury in motor accidents:-(a) Right of action shall not abate on the death ofthe insured:(b) Where a certificate of insurance has been issued,purporting to cover the driver in the circumstances of any particular accident, it shall not be open to the insurer to repudiate liability on the ground of misrepresentation or non-disclosure in the proposal forms(c) Any condition in a policy to the effect that theinsurer is not liable if the vehicle is driven when unsafe or damaged shall be void,  so far as any third party is concerned who has suffered personal injury or death:(d) An injured third party shall have a direct remedyagainst the insurer:(e) The deposit with the Supreme Court in respect of motor insurance business shall be (i) increased from  -15,000 to  20,000 to hying it Into conformity with the deposit required in other classes of insurance business^    and (ii)if practicable, earmarked for the satisfaction of outstanding claims in respect of death or personal Injury,  in any case where an insurance company is wound up.As regards (b)  (c) and (d) above it w0uld be desirable toprovide a right of recovery by the insurer against the insured.ROAD TRAFFIC (COMPENSATION FOR ACCIDENTS) BILL. ROAD TRAFFIC (EMERGENCY TREATMENT) BILL.&apos;Memorandum C.P.296(33) dealt with a Bill introduced by Lord Danesfort, of which the main object is to ensure that where bodily injury, including fatal injury, is caused by.the use of a motor vehicle, damages shall be recoverable from the owner of the vehicle, except where the injury was solely due to the negligence of the injured person.As I explained, htrd cases undoubtedly occur in which pedestrians are unable to secure compensation in circumstances in which they are justly entitled to it, but the Bill would have
*m Mno effect in reducing accidents, would lead to increases in premiums and involves a marked departure from the general principles of law.     In these circumstances,  its expediency-seems to me gravely open to doubt.The second Bill,  introduced by Lord Moynihan,  (with which I also dealt in CP. 296(55)) is on a different footing. It provides that a medical practitioner or a hospital that renders first aid treatment to a person injured in a motor accident shall be entitled to recover from the owner of any vehicle involved in the accident a fee of 12/6d., together with a mileage allowance for any distance which the practitioner has to travel.     This Bill has been exhaustively considered by a Committee of the House of Lords.The Committee considered an alternative proposal that a contribution should be made out of the Road Fund to meet the expenses of medical practitioners and hospitals and that to provide the necessary revenue an increase of 2/b&quot;d., or some such sum,  should be made in the fee for the driving licence. The objections to such a proposal are obvious, and after hearing the Treasury,  the Committee preferred the alternative embodied in the Bill.As I stated in my Memorandum I feel that it is not strictly just to throw on the motoring community as a whole,  in the shape of increased insurance premiums, the cost of remedying a grisvance created by the callous behaviour of a limited number of persons, and I have carefully considered whether there are any alternative methods of meeting an old grievance suffered by one section of the community without Imposing a new grievance on another section.      I fear, however,  that the alternative schemes, namely, a contribution from the Road Fund, or a contribution from the Exchequer,  are clearly impracticable.The feeling in Parliament is so strong that,  felling alternative suggestions,  amendments on the lines of Lord
11th January.Moynihan1 s Bill are almost certain, to be inserted in any legislation that may be introduced.      In these circumstances I feel, though reluctantly, that the best course is to incorporate Lord Moynihan&apos;s proposals in the Bill for the amendment of the Road Traffic Act,  for which I am now asking the approval of tho Cabinet.(intld.)
