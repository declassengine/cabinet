243 3^THIS DOOUkENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNkBNT).CABINET,F.-Q1 OBEB ELECTRIFICATION OF RAILWAY LINES AND CONSTRUCTION OF TUBERAILWAYS, IN EAST LONDON.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.ffiGSES COPY NO....3.?CP,38(3^)I have now received a memorandum from the Standing Joint Committee of the London Passenger Transport Board and the Main Line Railway Companies established under the London Passenger Transport Act, 1^33, which has for some time had under examination the question of affording additional facilities in North and East London.      The parties to the Committee are agreed that the most urgently needed scheme is one for providing an extension of the tube eastwards from Liverpool Street and an electrification of the suburban lines to such places as Ilford, Romford and Ongar.So long ago as 1526, the London Traffic Advisory Committee, after a prolonged public inquiry, reported that further railway facilities to  serve these places were urgently required and urged, in particular, that the suburban lines of the London and North Eastern Railway serving the area should be electrified.Since that date the London and North Eastern line between Gidea Park and Shenfield has been ^iaened from two to four tracks and the electrified tracks on the London, kidland and Scottish Company&apos;s line between &quot;whitechapel end Barking has been extended to Upminster so as to admit of the District Railway electric trains being operated as far as that town. Both of these works were   carried out with assistance from the Exchequer under the Development Act, 192$. ana while they have enabled Improved railway services to be provided beyond Gidea
- 2 -Park and Barking respectively, the services between the main centres of population in the area remain substantially as they were in 1926*     Since that date substantial housing and industrial developments in the area have intensified the need for improved facilities for passenger transport.The Joint Committee consider the following proposals to be necessary if the needs of the area are to be adequately provided for:- (a) the electrification of the L. &amp; N.E.Railway between Liverpool Street and Shenfield and between Liverpool Street and Ongar.Estimated Cost 7,000,000(b) an extension of the Central London TubeRailway via Stratford to a point north-east of Ilford.Estimated Cost 10,000,000(c) alterations to the joint line betweenAldgate and tfhitechapel to enable additional trains to be run by the Board between the City and Barking, including trains from the northern arc of the Inner Circle.Estimated Cost 1,850,000The additional facilities last-mentioned will apparently bring additional traffic and become remunerative.The other two schemes, the Joint Committee state, will not become fully remunerative for a number of years after completion.     They estimate that after 5 years the additional net revenue to be derived from these two schemes will be equivalent to little more than 2 per cent on the estimated capital expenditure of  17,000,000.It may well be that, on investigation, it will be found that the amount of capital expenditure which could properly be attributed to the improvement of suburban services is less than the  17,000,000 given as the estimated cost of schemes (a) and (b) and also that more favourable estimates of net revenue from the new works would be justified.
The Joint Committee make it clear that they consider that the three schemes are complementary and should he regarded as an inuivislble whole.      They contemplate that short distance traffic, e.g. up to 10 or 12 miles, would gravitate to the tube, thus enabling the surface lines to give quicker services to the longer distance traffic.     By this means housing development may be spread and encouraged farther afield in a way which is not possible so long as the same trains heve to serve the inner as well as the outer zones.     The postponement of any of the schemes would, therefore, In the Committee^ view, tend to prejudice the development of the area according to a harmonious and satisfactory plan axid would therefore not be in the best interests of traffic or of the wider social aspects of the problem, including town planning.     The Committee undoubtedly make a strong case for dealing with the problem comprehensively, and with regard to future   developments, rather than proceeding with the programme piecemeal.The Joint Committee attribute the relatively poor financial results which they estimate would flow from the execution of these schemes to the abnormally high proportion of persons resident in the area who have neither the resources nor the aptitude to seek their pleasures or to do their shopping other than locally, with the result that the traffic is mainly confined to a few peak hours and that during the remainder cf. the day rolling stock necessary to cope with the peak traffic is little used.      The Committee suggest, however, that the provision of comfortable and speedy railway services adequate to the needs of the area and the projection of those services to the main centres of shopping, pleasure and interest in London would encourage a large leaven of more prosperous residents in the area.
Under the pooling arrangements to he maae between the Board and the Main-line Companies-in accordance with the Act of 1955, the remuneration of any additional capital expended by the Board or the Main-line Companies on Improving passenger transport facilities in the London area becomes a charge on the Pool and the Joint Committee report that under existing conditions there is no margin of profits to support the capital expenditure required for schemes (a) and (b) referred to above.They add that there is no reluctance on the part of theBoard and the Main-line Companies to use the resouroes of the pool to the utmost but point out:-(l)    thet the Board is still uncertain of its obligations as the consideration to be paid for a number of omnibus undertakings which falls to be determined by the Arbitration Tribunal;(2)    that, by reason inter alia, of the fact that the terms of the pooling arrangement between the Board and the Main-line Companies have not yet been settled, no reliable estimate can be made of the net revenue of the Board, but that(3)    all the evidence would tend to show that the Board is incapable at the present time of earning interest upon its UC&quot; or junior Stock at the full rate contemplated by the Act of 1333 and- oould not Issue &quot;C&quot; Stock to provide, in part, for the capital cost of the proposed Tube extension.The London and North Eastern Railway Company are clearly not in a position to raise fresh capital except by the issue of further debentures.In the circumstances, despite the admitted urgency of providing additional travelling facilities in the area in question, I am satisfied that, until the financial prospects of the London pool show signs of definite Improvement, neither the Board nor the Main-line Companies are likely to embark on works of improvement in the London area Involving any appreciable capital expenditure which is not expected to be immediately remunerative.A small increase in the. level of fares generally in the London area would no doubt provide the necessary margins to support! the additional capital required for the suggested improvements, but!
I hesitate, under existing circumstances, to suggest to the board or to the Main-line Companies that they should increase theirfares.     Such a course,  if adopted at this stage, would undoubtedlycreate a good deal of public resentment and do much to impair the prestige of the Board before it had got properly into the saddle,and the responsibility, if any such suggestion were made, wouldquickly be cast upon the Government.During the passage of the London Transport Bill,spokesmen for the Government claimed that it should place london passenger transport on a self-supporting basis.      Lord Ashfieldhimself in his speech on the Second Reading of the Bill in theHouse of Lords said:-&quot;I have never allowed myself to believe that the travelling public of London would be permanently subsidised at the expense of the general taxpayer.      I firmly believe that in this London Passenger Transport Area, with a population which is roundly equivalent to 25 per cent of the total population of all these Isles, a population which is growing every year - in ten years a place the size of the City of Leeds has been added and last year alone the population increased by over  0,000 - by complete co-ordination, by complete fusion of all the different transport agencies and by coming to friendly arrangement with the main line companies in respect of their suburban services,  it ought to be possible to provide the facilities which are absolutely necessarj&apos; for the convenience and comfort of the people residing in this ares on a basis of fares which will attract them to the service and without calling on the taxpayers to provide any subsidy&quot;.I do not suppose that Lord Ashfield would wish to retract what he has said.      He will probably content himself by saying that for the reasons fully stated by the Joint Committee he cannot carry the proposals further at the present stage.If therefore the Government desire to press  the parties to the London Traffic pool to proceed with electrification and a new Tube at an early date, they must, in my opinion, consider whether they are prepared to authorise an offer of some financial assistance by the Government, and until some decision is reached on this vital point, detailed discussion of the Joint Committee&apos;s proposal on my part could serve no useful purpose.
248    &apos;- a - :The works suggested &quot;by the Joint Committee would, of course, provide substantial employment in the heavy engineering, electrical and railway carriage building industries, and would undoubtedly go a long way towards removing the crowded, unhealthy and uncomfortable conditions under which largo sections of the London public have to travel to and from their work.I understand that parliamentary powers would be necessary in connexion with the acquisition of land for the widening of the London and North Eastern line outside Liverpool Street and the Board would require powers for the construction of the proposed new tube.
SUMMARY.My conclusions in the matter are as follows(a) Of the many improvements needed in connection with London transport, entirely new rail facilities in the sector north of the Thames end ee3t of the River Lee should have priority.(b) The Boa id ana the Main Lines should be urged to proceed at once, end out of their owrj resources, with the alterations to the joint line between Aldgate and Whitechapel, wi-ich are estimated to cost under  2 millions and to be remunerative.(c) por the proper development of the area, and in order to avoid the creation of new housing and other problems In future, it is desirable that the construction of a newtube through Stretford to a point In the neighbourhood of Ilford, and the electrification of the L. &amp; N.&amp;.  suburban line between Liverpool Street, Ilford, Romfcrd and Shenfield should be treated as a comprehensive and complementary scheme, elthough the two lines will to some extent be competitive.     While no doubt the Standing Joint Committee is saved the difficulty of giving one of these two new facilities priority over the other by their present recommendation, I think that on merits there is a great deal to be said for their srgument that no satisfactory solution of the problem will be provided by one of them alone.     Whether or not they both need to be started et once is another question, but in considering the financial burden to be thrown upon the pool, both of them should be taken Into consideration together.(d) An essential element in any satisfactory scheme is the provision of direct facilities between the districts to be served and the west End of London.(e) The estimated expenditure of  17 millions is subject to examination and should admit of substantial reductions for the purpose of determining the amount proper to be charged to capital in respect of the nevv facilities.(f) But when all such adjustments have been made, the cost is such as to make it unlikely that either the Board or the Main Lines could agree to the necessary charge on tho receipts of the pool in the circumstances in which they are now placed.(g) There can be no doubt as to the value of the new capital equipment which Lonaon would receive by the execution of these works, or ss to the   substantial volumeof employment which they would provide in the iron and steel, electrical and rolling stock industries.(Intld.)
