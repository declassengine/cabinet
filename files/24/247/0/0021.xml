THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET . COPY N0.&amp;OGAB I NET.CP.21   (54)PURCHASE OP OILS OF RUSSIAN ORIGIN BY THE AIR MINISTRY.Note &quot;by the Under-Secretary of State for Air.1.      During the past few days statements have appeared in the Press to  the effect that the Air Ministry is making extensive purchases of oil from Russia.*   2.     As some of these statements have been highly mis-leading, the Cabinet may wish me (in the absence of the Secretary of State) to let them have a brief account of the facts, which are as follows(i)    The contract is for requirements of minerallubricating oil for aircraft engines and its total value (apart from distribution costs) will probably not exceed  22,500. (ii)    It is not &quot;being placed with R.O.P., but with the Anglo-American Oil Company and Sternol in the ordinary course.      No direct negotiations with Russian interests are involved., (ill)    What in fact has happened is that,  in inviting quotations this year, the Air Ministry decided to enquire the provenance of the oil from the firms tendering.      In -previous years there is little doubt that similar oil supplies have contained components derived from Russian sources, but as tenderers were not required to state the country of origin, this has not been.brought to notice. No change in specification has been made, but, owing to improvements recently introduced in Russian refining methods, oil companies in this
country have now found themselves able to meet requirements from entirely Russian sources.(iv)    None of the tenderers quoted for supplies from the Empire - no Imperial source heing apparently available.      The nearest approach was a single quotation for Peruvian oil, which would have been refined in Canada, (v)      The difference, however, between the price for the Peruvian produced and Canadian refined oil and that for Russian oils blended in England was approximately 40 per cent, and it was accordingly decided that the tender for oils of Russian origin should be accepted.(vi)      In view of the drawbacks to a fighting service of dependence on such foreign sources of supply, an investigation is being put in hand in the normal course to ascertain whether a source of Imperial supply at reasonable prices cannot be developed.P.  SASSOON.Air Ministry, 23rd January,1934.
