this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s goyernmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1934.SECRET. Copy No.    41CP. 32 (34).CABINET.INSTRUCTIONS TO SIR MILES LAMPSON1. THE new High Commissioner in Egypt. Sir Miles Lampson, is in London until the 10th February, when he leaves for Cairo. He has already spent ten days in Egypt on his way home from China : but his forthcoming return to Cairo will mark the real beginning of his term of office, and King Fuad and the Egyptian Government will naturally expect him to be in possession of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government on Anglo-Egyptian questions.2. In July last the Cabinet considered the question of the resumption of treaty negotiations with Egypt, and the Minutes record that the trend of the views of the Cabinet could be summed up as follows : (a) At the present moment it is undesirable to make any communication tothe Egyptian Government on the subject of the proposed Treaty negotiations.(b) When the Egyptian Government press for a reply, as no doubt they willwhen a favourable opportunity (such as the arrival in Cairo of the High Commissioner) arises, they should be told that our preoccupations in the coming winter make it impossible to begin conversations now, but that we do contemplate doing so some time in the course of next year.(c) That, in agreeing to negotiations next year, notwithstanding the state-ment of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that &apos;&apos; there is no prospect whatever, in my view, of the present, or any, Egyptian Government accepting any Treaty which maintains the British troops in or near Cairo &quot; (CP. 152 (33)), the Cabinet are in no way committed to a decision in favour of removing the troops from the neighbourhood of Cairo.(d) That, whenever a communication on the subject has to be made to theEgyptian Government, it would be inadvisable, in the first stage, to warn them of the special difficulties likely to arise in connexion with the Sudan and the stations for the British troops.(e) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should consider the besttime and method for giving effect to the above policy.3. No action has been taken in Cairo as yet on these Conclusions, but King Fuad has already mentioned to Sir Miles Lampson the subject of the Treaty, and will certainly raise the question again on Sir Miles&apos;s arrival from London next week. Consequently, unless Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s instructions are varied, he will, in virtue of conclusion (b) above, be authorised to say that we contemplate entering upon treaty negotiations with the Egyptian Government some time in the course of the present year. I feel, however, that there are two considerations which should be present to our minds before the carrying out of such instructions is entered upon, and they are of such gravity as to lead me to ask the Cabinet to vary the instructions.4. The first consideration is that the Sidky Ministry has fallen and the present Egyptian Government (the Prime Minister since Sidky&apos;s resignation in September last is Abdel Fattah Yehia Pasha) does not possess that degree of7239   [9613]
support in Egypt itself which would constitute a satisfactory guarantee for the stability of any treaty settlement into which we might enter with them. The previous decision of the Cabinet, above quoted, was in part reached because Sidky Pasha&apos;s Administration appeared to provide an exceptional opportunity for negotiation with a trustworthy Egyptian Government, which would endeavour to fulfil its obligations under the new Treaty. But all the indications are, since Sidky Pasha&apos;s resignation, that the reins of government in Egypt are being drawn increasingly into the hands of King Fuad himself. The present Egyptian Cabinet provide merely a parliamentary facade, and their majority is precarious, even in a Chamber from which the chief Opposition group, the Wafd, is excluded. Their defeat in the Chamber, or, indeed, a continuance of the kind of trouble and agitation which is already occurring in the Egyptian Parliament, may well result in the suspension of the Parliamentary regime altogether. In short, the present Egyptian Government is not a suitable Government with which to negotiate a treaty. On this point my advisers, including Sir Miles Lampson on the basis of his admittedly short experience of Egyptian affairs, are emphatic.5. And there is a second consideration. On further reflection I doubt very much whether it is expedient to announce our readiness to open negotiations until we have determined in our own minds where we stand on the unsettled, but most important, point of the future location of the British forces. I have already told the Cabinet, in my memorandum of the 2nd June last, CP. 152 (33), that in the view of my advisers, both in Egypt and in London, there is no real prospect of obtaining an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty which does not involve the withdrawal of the British forces from the neighbourhood of Cairo. Until we have decided whether we are prepared to withdraw our forces to the Canal zone as the only condition upon which a Treaty could be obtained, we should, in my opinion, be ill-advised to say anything to the Egyptians to the effect that we hoped to negotiate a Treaty with them this year.6. On the above two grounds I hope that the Cabinet will consider it wise to modify the instructions above quoted. I should propose, in that event, to tell Sir Miles Lampson to reply to King Fuad, when challenged on the point, that he has had some preliminary discussions with us, but that we wish him to make a further report on the situation in three or four months&apos; time, as we feel that we could not decide how to proceed until we can have the full benefit of his advice, based on actual experience of the conditions of the country and other circumstances. I should propose, further, to authorise Sir Miles Lampson to use his own discretion as to whether or not he should drop a hint that the prospects of treaty negotiations being entered upon were naturally affected by considerations relative to the stability of the Egyptian Government.7. If instructions on these modified lines were approved, this would enable Sir Miles Lampson to send us promptly, before his general report, his own views formed on the spot as to the pros and cons of moving the troops. The Egyptian Sub-Committee would, I imagine, desire to have these views before they enter upon and decide the question whether or not we could contemplate any and what removal as the condition of a Treaty.8. There is a further matter connected with this subject which I take this opportunity of bringing to the notice of the Cabinet, though it does not directly bear upon the instructions to be given this week to Sir Miles Lampson. It is as follows : As stated above in paragraph 4, it seems very possible that the present Parliamentary regime in Egypt will not survive, and that King Fuad, who is showing an increasing tendency towards autocratic rule, will become a despotic Sovereign without any effective legislature or any independent ministerial advice. In this event, Anglo-Egyptian relations will take on a new phase which may involve considerable embarrassment and even danger for ourselves. Assuming that British troops remain in Cairo, their presence there will, in fact, more and more be regarded as the support of the Palace. If King Fuad adopts the bad behaviour into which an oriental monarch may be tempted to lapse and revolu-tionaiy demonstrations against him arise, we shall be faced with the difficult choice between supporting the King in spite of his behaviour and helping to suppress the trouble, or of warning him that we cannot support.him in such courses and thereby attempting actively to influence the internal policy and administra-tion of Egypt.  It would be a serious matter to abandon our present policy, which
has often been publicly proclaimed, that we do not interfere in the internal affairs -of Egypt. On the other hand, we should run great risks if the King gathered round him much unpopularity, for we should be accused of buttressing Palace Government which would otherwise come to an end. Moreover, if the end of it was that absolutism is overthrown, our own prestige would in that event suffer a heavy blow, and the popular demand would be that the despot and his guard should go together.9. These are general considerations which will, of course, be the subject of Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s close thought in the days to come. But they seem to me also of some immediate importance as bearing upon the question whether our troops, by remaining in Cairo, are not exposing us to special risks of being involved in such difficulties as I have sketched out above. Another aspect of the matter, which will have to be weighed, is whether we do not keep a useful hold over the King and restrain him from adopting a line of policy which we could not approve, by holding before him the prospect of a treaty if suitable Parliamentary Government in Egypt is re-established.10. As I have said, the observations in paragraph 8 above need not be immediately considered in reference to Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s instructions, but, perhaps, the Cabinet would think it well to refer them for consideration by the Egyptian Sub-Committee when they next meet. The Cabinet will remember that the general question of the Egyptian treaty has been remitted to a Sub-Committee of the C.I.D. (Cabinet 50 (32), Conclusion 6 (a)).J.
