Note &quot;by the Secretary.I am directed by the Prime Minister to say that,  in accordance with the instructions of the Cabinet35 a meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence was held on Thursday, February 22nd,  to consider the question of giving a guarantee of protection to the Sheikh of Q,atar.Immediately afterwards a meeting of Ministers was heldat which the following conclusions were agreed:-(i)    that It was desirable,  in principle, that any oil concessions granted in the Sheikhdom of Qatar should be retained in British hands;(ii)    that before the question of the opening of negotiations could be considered further it would be necessary to draw up a formula as to the &quot;basis of such negotiations; this formula to represent a middle course between the proposals of the Secretary of State for India for full and complete guarantees and  the recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff for a guarantee    limited to protection against major aggression;(iii)    to instruct the Standing OfficialSub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East to work out a formula on the lines indicated in (ii)  above as early as possible;(iv)    that there should be included in the formula document an indication of the geographical boundary which would limit the extent of any guarantee that might be contemplated;-1-*Cabinet 6(34) Conclusion 3.
(v)    that a short report to the Cabinet should be drawn up for consideration at their next meeting which would include the formula to be suggested by the Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East, together with a further recommendation that if approval was given to open negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar on the lines of the formula to be prepared,  the Secretary of State for India should be asked to keep his colleagues in touch with the progress of the negotiations, and that if they developed unfavourably the basis might have to be reconsidered..Attached to this Note is a copy of the formula prepared by the Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions concerning the Middle East, referred to in Conclusion (ii) above.2, Whitehall Gardens, S*W.l. 23rd February,  1934.
TERMS OP GUARANTEE TO EE OFFERED TO THE SHEIKH AND LIMITS OF THE AREA TO 71JICH THAT GUARANTEE SHOULD APPLY.Formula agreed to &quot;by the Standing Official Sub-Committeefor Questions Go:; ierning the Middle East.1. His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to givethe Sheikh a guarantee in respect of unprovoked aggression by land in return for the grant by him of an oil concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (acting for the Iraq Petroleum Company), but are anxious to confine it to major aggression, i.e.s to unprovoked attack by the ruler of a neighbouring State, and to major Bedouin raids.       They could not, without establishing a regular defensive system on the frontier, which they cannot contemplate, give an assurance that in no circumstances would any small hostile force be allowed to cross the Qatar boundary, and they cannot accept liability for meeting minor raids.      Moreover, here, as in Koweit, they would of course expect the Sheikh to take reasonable steps for his own defence and for maintaining order within; his own borders. If, as His Majesty&apos;s Government hope, a guarantee within these limits will satisfy the Sheikh, they suggest that it might be in the following terms -&quot;That in the event of any serious and unprovoked attack His Majesty&apos;s Government will come to his assistance and maintain the independence of his State&quot;.2* His Majesty&apos;s Government have considered, as analternative, an assurance on the lines of the Koweit formula of 1914, 1. e. , that Qatar shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection. This seems unlikely to satisfy the Sheikh, since His Majesty&apos;s Government are already in treaty relations
with him as an independent ruler, while the term &quot;protection1  thus used might alarm him by suggesting the idea of a Protectorate.      If, however, the Resident thinks that the Sheikh would prefer it, either alone or with addition of formula suggested above, he may use it so long as it is clearly understood by the Sheikh that the assurance of protection does not go beyond the limits specified in paragraph 1 above.3- It would of course be essential to obtain fromthe Sheikh, in return for any guarantee given, the facilities required by the Royal Air Force to enable the guarantee to be implemented - i.e. , probably two landing grounds and freedom of movement for the necessary British personnel.      We assume that no diffi-culty will arise about this and that the csheikh would he willing to provide, on payment, guards for aerodromes.4. The question of the precise boundary to beadopted is already under reference to you (see India Office telegram No. 440 Of 16th February, 1934). Subject to your further views his Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the area to which the above guarantee should apply should for the present not be regarded as extending to the south of a line drawn from a point at the head of Bohat-as-Salwa Bay passing south of Salwa and of Saleak to the coast immediately north of the Khor-al-Odeid inlet.
CONCLUSION.THE SUBCOMMITTEE unanimously reached the following Conclusions -(a) They recommend that the terms of the guarantee to be offered to the Sheikh, and the limits of the area to which that guarantee should apply, should be on the lines proposed in the attached draftt ele gram (Append i x)0(b) The question of a caveat providing that the guarantee shall not apply in the event of oil not being found, or, if found, not being exploited, is mentioned in the papers circulated to the Sub-committee. This point is not directly referred to them for an opinion.        It is, however,so closely bound up with that of the terms of the guarantee that the Sub-Committee feel it their duty to record their opinion upon it.      They appreciate the arguments in favour of a caveat of this nature, but are of opinion that its addition to the proposed assurance would very seriously diminish the value of that assurance to the Sheikh.    It is moreover relevant that the Iraq Petroleum Company, on the informa-tion available, may well adopt a very con-servative policy as regards the development of any oil found in Qatar.      In the opinion of the Sub-Committee, even to suggest such a    caveat would, apart from other consequences, gravely jeopardise the chances of securing the concession for the Iraq Petroleum Company, while insistence on it would, in their view, inevitably result in failure to achieve this object.
APPENDIX. DRAFT    TELEGRAM.  -1&apos; His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to givethe Sheikh a guarantee in respect of unprovoked aggression by land in return for the grant by him of an oil concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (acting for the Iraq Petroleum Company), but are anxious to confine it to major aggression, i.e., to unprovoked attack by the ruler of a neighbouring State, and to major Bedouin raids.       They could not, without establishing a regular defensive system on the frontier, which they cannot contemplate, give an assurance that in no circumstances would any small hostile force be allowed to cross the Qatar boundary, and they cannot accept liability for meeting minor raids.      Moreover, here, as in Koweit, they would of course expect the Sheikh to take reasonable steps for his own defence and for maintaining order within his own borders. If, as His Majesty&apos;s Government hope, a guarantee within these limits will satisfy the Sheikh, they suggest that it might be in the following terms -&quot;That in the event of any serious and unprovoked attack His Majesty&apos;s Government will come to his assistance and maintain the independence of his State&quot;.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government have considered, as analternative, an assurance on the lines of the Koweit formula of 1914, Le. , that Qatar shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection. This seems unlikely to satisfy the Sheikh, since His Majesty&apos;s Government are already in treaty relations
with him as an independent ruler, while the term &apos;protection&apos;  thus us ed might alarm him by suggesting the idea of a protectorate.      If, however, the Resident thinks that the Sheixh would prefer it, either alone or with addition of formula suggested-above, he may use it go long as it is clearly understood by the Sheikh that the assurance of protection sees not go beyond the limits specified in paragraph 1 above.3. It would of course &quot;be essential to obtain fromthe Sheikh, in return for any guarantee given, the facilities required by the Royal Air Force to enable the guarantee to be implemented - i.e. , probably two landing grounds and freedom of movement for the necessary British personnel.      We assume that no diffi-culty will arise about this and that the Sheikh would be willing to provide, on payment, guards for aerodromes.4. The question of the precise boundary to beadopted is already under reference to you (see India Office telegram No. 440 of 16th February, 1934), Subject to your further views his Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the area to which the; above guarantee should apply should tor- the present not be regarded as extending to the south of a line drawn from a point at the head of Dohat-as-Balwa Bay passing south of Balwa and of Saleak to the coast immediately north of the Khor-al-Odeid inlet.
