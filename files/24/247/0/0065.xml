THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT409Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1934.SECRET.A copy No.CP. 65 (34).CABINET.RUBBER REGULATION SCHEME.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.AT the 70th Meeting of the Cabinet on the 20th December, 1933 (Conclusion 70 (33), Item 7), the Secretary of State for the Colonies gave a review of the negotiations which had taken place to that date in regard to the proposed scheme for rubber restriction. He then emphasised (i) that it was for the producing interests concerned to submit a generally agreed and practicable scheme to their respective Governments; (ii) that he had made it clear to the British producers that they must accept the responsibility of examining and guaranteeing to His Majesty&apos;s Government the practicability of the arrange-ments proposed by the Dutch producers and authorities for the regulation of rubber supplies in the Netherlands East Indies.2. Negotiations between the producing interests concerned have continued since the 20th December, and there was also a discussion (on the 10th February) between Dr. Colijn, the Dutch Prime Minister, and Sir John Campbell (the Financial and Economic Adviser to the Secretary of State for the Colonies), who was accompanied by Mr. J. G. Hay, the leading representative of the British producers.3. The following documents are now circulated to the Cabinet at the request of the Secretary of State for the Colonies : (A) Note of the discussion referred to in the preceding paragraph, preparedby Sir John Campbell;(B) Extracts from private letters sent to the Secretary of State (at port said) on the 15th and 22nd February by his Private Secretary;(C) Telegram received from the Secretary of State (at Port Said) on the3rd March.4. No immediate action by the Cabinet is necessary, but it will be convenient to summarise the present position below : (a) The crux of the problem remains that of controlling effectively nativeproduction in the Netherlands East Indies. As mentioned in the letter sent to the Secretary of State on the 22nd February, the representatives of the British producers were urged not to agree to the signing of any agreement and its submission to His Majesty&apos;s Government until they were in a position to give an assurance that they were satisfied that an effective scheme for the control of native rubber in the Netherlands East Indies had been put forward by the Dutch authorities. They have again been urged strongly, in a similar sense, since the receipt of the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram. It is believed that the British producers now understand the position clearly, and that there is no risk of their signing and submitting an agreed scheme until they are in a position to give the assurance required.[9757]b
(b) There is little hope that progress will be made, so far as the furtherelaboration and examination of the Dutch scheme is concerned, until the &quot; Secret &quot; Committee which Dr. Colijn has agreed to set up has met. Dr. Colijn has recently been reminded as to this, and has been asked to appoint the two Dutch representatives on the &apos;&apos; Secret&apos;&apos; Committee and to convene an early meeting. No reply was received until the 5th March, when Dr. Colijn informed Sir John Campbell of the names of the two Dutch representatives. It is hoped that a meeting of the Committee will take place on Monday, the 12th March, the earliest day convenient to the Dutch representatives.(c) Most of the points to which the Secretary of State refers in his telegram are matters of detail which can most suitably be discussed by the &apos;&apos; Secret&apos;&apos; Committee, when constituted, or by the Joint Negotiating Committee to which they would be submitted by Mr. Hay after unofficial discussion with the Colonial Office.(Signed) J. H. THOMAS.Dominions Office, March 7, 1934.(A)Note of a Meeting with Dr. Colijn on February 10, 1934.Present:Dr. Colijn, his private secretary, Mr. Reyseger; Mr. A. van der Eijk (of the &quot;Amsterdam&quot; Company and a member of the Dutch negotiating committee); Sir John Campbell and Mr. J. G. Hay.THE discussion lasted for two and a half hours.General Statement of British Position.Mr. Hay gave a summary of the present position. He explained what was being done to bring in Siam, mentioned the success with Sarawak, and emphasised that we did not know as yet how the scheme, as outlined generally in the draft agreement, would be applied in fact in the Netherlands East Indies. He stressed the point that a most dangerous situation was rapidly being built up; the price had risen; production especially native production in the Netherlands East Indies was increasing very rapidly. The task before any international regulating committee was becoming harder each day; and the rise in price would most seriously affect the willingness of native producers in particular to &apos;&apos; come in &quot; to any scheme. They did not look beyond immediate facts. They saw now a profitable price, with unrestricted production; they would be most reluctant to abandon that position. Speculation was rampant; and the whole situation had been materially worsened by the communiques issuing from Amsterdam, in particular. There had been a series of such communiques, showing &apos;&apos; inside &apos;&apos; knowledge, and all tending to produce the impression that regulation was practically an accomplished fact. It was essential to stop this, in the interests of the Governments concerned, of the industry, and of the prospects of primary        finally arriving at some scheme of regulation.   Dr. Colijn said, from his pointn.e.i.s m t 6  of view, there were four primary factors.Control of (a) Control of native rubber in the Netherlands East Indies.   This was thenative rubber, dominant question. They could not work a &quot; quota &quot; scheme at once; time was necessary for that. But, equally, the time during which some provisional arrange-ment would continue must be short say one year. Control initially would have to be by export taxes; but any such system meant, essentially, inequalities, and could not last for long. The man near the ports could always produce; the distant man could not. The natives would not stand that for long the inequity of the thing would become too obvious. It was essential, therefore, that they should pass as rapidly as possible from this system to a real quota system. He thought that, by employing Europeans they could easily get about 2,000 now unemployed they could work out a regional system; fix the quotas by small
regions; and work rapidly to a real quota basis. The export duty would have to vary, according to the necessities of the case, in demarcated regional areas. He emphasised that the thing would in any case be so worked as to carry out tae agreement; the Netherlands East Indies would shoulder the full responsibility for seeing that total exports did not exceed their national quota.(b) This led him to his second main point.The export duties would obviously depend on the external price of rubber; the higher that price was, the greater the difficulty. The export duties would have to be correspondingly high; and this brought in its train a whole series of difficulties political, economic, and social. Price and export duties would have to run together. This was the reason (mainly, but not wholly) for the Netherlands East Indies insistence on a price somewhere near 4rf. gold say Qd. sterling. He strongly insisted on this point. The thing need not go into the agreement; but it would have to be accepted as in the minds of those who had to work that agreement.(c) He said that the relation between the European and native production required that the measure of restriction should not exceed 50 per cent. Anything greater than 50 per cent, seemed impracticable, administratively. This also need not be put into the agreement; but the preceding remarks applied. It would have to be understood that this was the limit of restriction.(d) Lastly, the situation which had developed necessitated some method of gradual progression to attain the initial measure of restriction which the inter-national committee might agree on. Native production was running, now, at the rate of say 180,000 tons a year. The standard was 147,000 tons. Suppose 60 per cent, production was finally decided, they could not bring the natives down from 180,000 (and the figure would probably be higher then) to 88,200 at once. His definite suggestion (after considerable discussion) was give them their standard for the first month (147,000); then cut the standard by 15 per cent, a month till the 88,200 figure was reached. This meant roughly four months before a 40 per cent, cut would become fully effective.Mr. Hay dealt with these points. His first question was how can you relate an export tax to actual exports ? Dr. Colijn appreciated the difficulty; but said the Netherlands East Indies would give their guarantee as to exports they would not exceed the national quota. The thing was workable in practice; and they would work it, in accordance with the agreed scheme.Mr. Hay then pointed out that, even if one accepted this, production might, and probably would, pile up behind the export barrier. That would in itself be contrary to the scheme. Dr. Colijn&apos;s reply was that the Netherlands East Indies would attend to that also; production would not be allowed to pile up; they would destroy the rubber, if necessary.The discussion then turned to the price question. Mr. Hay and I pointed out that the price to-day was already close to Dr. Colijn&apos;s limit. The effect on the native producer was again alluded to. What would his reaction be? and how would this price limitation affect the willingness of plantation owners to support the scheme ? I emphasised the fact that the scheme, as at present agreed, gave no control whatever, of a direct character, over prices; price had to adjust itself within the framework of the scheme. In one case only could we affect price by deliberately allowing more rubber than was required to be produced, as a possible weapon to counter a price rise which was considered dangerous. That would, of course, have its inevitable repercussion. It meant action, counter to the funda-mental policy of the scheme, and designed solely to meet a price rise, considered dangerous, which could not be met by any other method.Dr. Colijn then asked us to consider, in this connexion, another major problem. He felt that the restriction scheme should be definitely designed to cut out the inefficient producer. The price weapon was the only weapon one could employ to that end. He alluded to American anxieties as to price, and the political effects of a high price generally. Mr. Hay and I replied that you could not obtain the necessary support for any restriction scheme which had as its avowed object the elimination of all but the efficient producers. No Government could get a restriction scheme through, nor could it work it, without the support of the mass of producers. They were behind the present scheme, because it offered  or seemed to offer to all of them a chance of surviving, till better times came. If you offered them now a price very close to the existing price, as a maximum,[9757] b 2The necessity for working to a price.Maximum measure of restriction.Graduation ininitialrestriction.British criticism of the above points.Export tax law related to actual exports.Production, as distinguished from exports.Price.Price, as affecting the elimination of the inefficient.

Both of us discounted opposition from the United States of America -they were not in a position to take up any strong line in this matter. I pointed out also that, even under Dr. Colijn&apos;s plan, if it could be applied, there was no real solution. The rubber would still be there : it would pass into Chinese hands, probably to a large extent; they would have it at a &quot; bargain price&apos;&apos;; they would have almost no &quot;overheads &quot; ; and they would then in turn become the &quot;most efficient producers.&quot; But the major objection was that, as already explained, the scheme gave no normal means of price control. We could not possibly embark on a scheme, if it were regarded as linked essentially to a determined price, with no means whatever of reaching and maintaining that price. Dr. Colijn then asked what price Mr. Hay had in mind as probable, under the normal working of the scheme. Mr. Hay said something like 7d. or 8d.- but it must be recognised that this matter would be settled by the play of the market.  He could not undertake the role of prophet.Mr. Hay then passed to the limit of restriction proposed 50 per cent. He pointed out that, logically, there ought to be no limit; we did not know how the thing would work. A heavy drop in consumption might force us below 50 per cent. If we fixed 50 per cent., we tied our hands; and we might, by adopting that limit, render the scheme ineffective. The result of any failure to restrict adequately on price, and on market opinion as to the effectiveness of the scheme, was alluded to. He pointed out that the scheme, as drafted, enabled the -Netherlands East Indies to prevent any &quot;cut&quot; coming into force, if it felt that it was impossible for it to work that &quot; cut.&quot; I agreed; and drew attention to our &quot;tin&quot; experience in this matter. A measure of restriction, which the circum-stances demanded, was declared by Malaya to be administratively impossible; the logic of events, and the accumulation of experience of restriction, enabled Malaya later to accept that &quot;cut,&quot; and to go much lower than they had originally contemplated as possible, in any circumstances. There would not improbably be something analogous in the case of rubber. After considerable discussion, Dr. Colijn was satisfied that this point should be abandoned.   He dropped it.Mr. Hay then dealt with the proposal to introduce restriction gradually. He pointed out the effect of this on the market, and on price; unless the world at large was convinced that we &quot;meant business,&quot; the price would not respond. (&quot;Tin&quot; experience supports this view, strongly.) He appreciated the adminis-trative difficulties which this proposal was designed to alleviate; and personally he would be prepared to accept it, while recognising its disadvantages. Nothing would, he presumed, be said as to this in the scheme; the matter was clearly one for the international committee, when constituted. Much would depend on the wording of their announcement. A suitable form of words would mitigate the undesirable repercussions of such a plan. Dr. Colijn said, if we were prepared to accept this point he would drop his &quot;price&quot; point. Mr. Hay and I accepted, so far as we personally were concerned. Mr. Hay did not anticipate any difficulties from the point of view of the negotiating committee; nor did I, from the point of view of the Colonial Office or the Governments. It was made clear that this measure of gradualness would be general; it would apply to all the parties to the scheme. The necessity arises from the position as regards native rubber in the Netherlands East Indies; but the application would be general. Dr. Colijn agreed. The &quot;price&quot; point, and the &quot; maximum limit of restriction &quot; point, were thus dropped; &quot; gradualness &quot; will be dealt with as above. (I do not think this will present any difficulties; indeed, it is likely to prove acceptable in itself to all the Governments, and to the industry, as making the transition from freedom to restriction easier to them. It delays a little getting to grips with the problem but four months is not a serious matter, once restriction is accepted. And a careful wording of the announcement will do much to mitigate the effect on price, and on confidence in the scheme.)Dr. Colijn then asked when assuming the thing went through the scheme could be put into operation. He suggested, tentatively, the 1st April. Mr. Hay and I worked out a probable time-table; it was clear that the 1st May would be Communiques, the earliest possible date. We returned to the subject of the Amsterdam communiques and communiques generally. Dr. Colijn promised to do all he could, both in Holland and in the Netherlands East Indies, to put this matter right.   In this connection I pointed out the &quot; political &quot; effect of what had beenLimitation of restriction abandoned by Dr. Colijn.Gradual restriction in initial stage.&quot;Price&quot; point dropped it gradual restriction accepted.Gradual restriction accepted initially.Time when scheme can be operated.
going on. Distrust was being bred; some people here thought that the Dutch were deliberately utilising the negotiations as a means of national or sectional advantage. The effect of this on the prospects of getting any scheme through were obvious. Dr. Colijn appreciated the point, and the fact that all this optimistic talk was making the problem very much harder for everyone. On the suggestion of Mr. Hay, Dr. Colijn agreed to the issue of an immediate communique (from the Colonial Office) in the following terms: &apos;&apos; Current reports, to the effect that agreement has been reached for the regulation of rubber supplies, are inaccurate and without authority. The Government of the Netherlands concurs in this statement.&quot; We all agreed that the issue of this at once would do much, probably, to damp down the existing excitement and speculation; all of us felt that the issue of this statement was desirable, in the interests alike of the Governments concerned and of the industry. Mr. Hay then raised the question whether we could not adopt some method which would, in itself, secure greater secrecy. He suggested that, without in any way affecting or interfering with the existing machinery, there should be a very small secret committee to discuss questions such as those we have been considering to-day. After some conversation, it was agreed that such a committee would be advantageous : one &apos;&apos; Government&apos;&apos; and one &apos;&apos; industry &apos;&apos; man, both nominated by the Government, on each side. Dr. Colijn will make his nominations and inform us. On our side, I suppose it had better be Mr. Hay and myself? Dr. Colijn thought that it would be wise for this small committee to meet anywhere but The Hague and London.   The Hague, anyhow, is unsuitable.Mr. Hay then referred to two minor points : the adhesion of Siam and the position of the producer manufacturer. He explained the steps taken as regards Siam, and indicated that, to save time, it might, perhaps, be advisable to go on with all the preparations for the introduction of the scheme before having Siam&apos;s formal adhesion. The thing might be worked out in detail and ratified, subject to the adhesion of Siam to secure which all measures possible would meanwhile be taken.  Dr. Colijn agreed.As regards the producer-manufacturer, Mr. Hay said opinion in the industry was that they should be on exactly the same basis as other producers. He summarised the objections to any special treatment being accorded. Dr. Colijn agreed generally. He said that Goodyear&apos;s people had approached him, very tentatively, asking what measure of support they might count on if they erected a factory. &quot; Hapm &quot; which is understood to be, in effect, the American General Rubber Company had also raised the latex question, on the same lines that Dunlops took with us. After discussion, it was agreed that this latex question,. and the treatment to be accorded to the producer-manufacturer, were matters for the consideration of the international regulating committee. These people would have to make out a case, and to convince the Committee that what they asked for was in the interests of the industry, and reasonable in itself. It was the Committee&apos;s affair and should be left entirely to them. Before concluding the discussion, I asked Dr. Colijn if he was satisfied that tne Netherlands East Indies could effectively work the scheme, on the main lines as now settled, for native rubber in their territories. He said he was. But there were essential conditions which must be satisfied. As already explained, the control by export taxes must be temporary. He did not think they could &quot; hold &quot; that situation for more than a year. The regional quotas must be worked out within that period. He was satisfied the plan could and would be worked effectively; but again he repeated that time was of the essence of the matter. The export tax device must be limited in time otherwise it would fail. It was possible that the Volksraad in the Netherlands East Indies might reject the restriction scheme; if it did reject any.scheme which he finally decided to accept, he would go over their heads by a Royal Decree. If it came to that, the Volksraad had a right of appeal against that Decree to the Dutch Parliament. His business would then be to defend that Royal Decree there, and to carry his point. It was agreed that this meeting should be regarded as entirely secret. The small secret committee proposed above would similarly work as a secret committee; only when things had been worked out would the &quot;industry&quot; members of that small committee communicate such information as appeared desirable to their respective committees.(Signed) J.

(B) (1)My dear Secretary of State, February 15, 1934.I am writing to you again about rubber. In my last letter I mentioned that Campbell was going to see Colijn last Saturday (the 10th February).I now enclose (1) A copy of campbell&apos;s note of the meeting.(2) A copy of the Press communique&quot; which appeared in the Press here on Tuesday. (I might mention that the communique has already had an excellent effect in steadying the market. The price has dropped from over 5d. to 4 21 /S2d.)Lord Plymouth and Sir John Maffey discussed Sir John Campbell&apos;s note briefly with him, and as a result of this it was decided that he and Mr. Hay should be our representatives on the &quot; Secret &quot; Committee. Dr. Colijn has been informed to this effect. A copy of the note is also being sent out secretly to Stubbs* and Caldecott,t who are being informed that no objection is seen here to the proposed gradual approach within which the measure of restriction decided upon by the International Committee is to be made effective.Hay says that it is likely that the restriction scheme proposed by the industry will be submitted to us as early as the 22nd of this month. Assuming that this happens, it is proposed to send the scheme out at once to Malaya and Ceylon by the first air mail. Simultaneously, the scheme will be examined here, and will be presented to the Cabinet for preliminary consideration. It should then be possible for a summary of the Cabinet&apos;s provisional views to be telegraphed to Ceylon and Malaya within a very few days of their receiving the scheme, and it would be possible to let the local people know what action to take as regards public consideration of the scheme in those colonies. If things work out as Hay prophesies, you will, I am afraid, not be home in time to present the scheme to the Cabinet, but we assume that you would not wish to delay the submission to the Cabinet on that account.The only other news, and it is disappointing news, is about Siam. As I think I told you, Hay suggested that two members of the local &quot; restriction &quot; committee in Malaya should go to Bangkok to negotiate direct with the Siamese Government. This suggestion has been put to the Siamese Government, and strongly supported by our Minister in Bangkok, Dormer; but a telegram received from him on Tuesday states that there is still dreadful confusion in the Government Departments in Siam, and that, despite constant reminders, he has been unable to obtain a definite reply from the Department concerned. Apparently the matter will have to be considered by a Council of Ministers, whenever such a Council meets. Dormer was very pessimistic about our chances of obtaining any prompt co-operation from Siam, but, as you will see from Campbell&apos;s note, the matter is not as urgent as it once was, since Dr. Colijn is fully seized of the position, and has agreed that non-participation by Siam need not be a fatal bar to the introduction of a scheme.Yours sincerely, (Signed) F. G. LEE.(2)My dear Secretary of State, February 22, 1934.Rubber.There is, I am afraid, no progress to report. We understand that the agreement is ready for signature by the parties concerned and for submission to the Governments; but that the question of the control of native rubber in the Netherlands East Indies is still outstanding and unsettled.Play is getting more and more anxious about this; the latest figure for native production there runs at the rate of 200,000 tons a year, although the quota proposed under the scheme for 1934 is only 146,000 tons, and it does not actually rise to 200,000 tons until 1938. In other words, before the scheme has started to function, the Dutch native has demonstrated his ability to export rubber at a rate* Governor of Ceylon.f Acting Governor of Straits Settlements.
which is equivalent to 130 per cent, of his first year&apos;s quota. If the initial cut is to be 40 per cent., then the native will have to descend from 130 per cent to 60 per cent. In no other class of producer will the descent be so heavy. There really does not seem much hope that the industry or we here will be able to scrutinise the Dutch plans for native rubber control in detail until the secret committee which I mentioned in my last letter has got to work. Nothing has been heard from Dr. Colijn about this if we do not hear in a day or two, Campbell will send a tactful letter of enquiry.It is possible, according to Hay, that the negotiators may wish to sign the agreement for a restriction scheme and to submit it forthwith to the Governments concerned, making it clear, however, that no assurance could yet be given to the effect that they were satisfied with the adequacy and efficacy of the Dutch plans for control of native rubber. Past experience suggests strongly that the fact that the agreement had been signed and submitted would not be kept secret and the Government would presumably be at once badgered as to the action which they had taken, and criticised severely for what would, in the circumstances, be inevitable delay in getting the scheme started. We are, therefore, suggesting to Hay that, however embarrassing this may be to the negotiators and to the Rubber Growers&apos; Association, the wiser course would be to hold the thing back until it can be presented to Government in a complete form, i.e., with the Dutch scheme &apos;&apos; vetted &apos;&apos; by the industry. Meanwhile, we shall do all we can, through the secret committee, to force on the Dutch the completion of their scheme for the Netherlands East Indies.The market has been rather quieter. Hay thinks that it has at last begun to believe that the warnings which we issued earlier were justified by the situation, and were not a mere tactical step.Yours sincerely, (Signed)        F. G. LEE.(0)Decypher Telegram from His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Consul, Port Said. Dated 3rd March, 1934. (Received 9-30 a.m. 3rd March, 1934.)No. 1.Following for Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies from Secretary of State for the Colonies : Begins: Rubber meeting admirably handled.   Following comments : Agreement must provide clearly exactly how it is to be worked. This is particularly important if Dutch native rubber is to be controlled by stages.There can be no secret understandings.   All producers must know terms.Immediate negotiations must be secret, but if a revised plan is to be adopted it must be approved by industry as a whole, as we originally arranged.Fixing of price and limit on restriction both impossible.Gradual approach of maximum restriction could be accepted, but interim period should be as short as possible as stocks will pile up.I strongly suggest agreement should provide for date by which maximum limitation as fixed by International Committee must be reached.I think production in excess of permitted quota or export should be destroyed unless International Committee otherwise direct. Any surplus stock depresses the market.You will not get any scheme accepted if you say it is designed to eliminate inefficient producer unless you offer definite compensation. You may, and I hope will, eliminate him later by the price Committee fix and by transfer quotas. United States cannot object (a) their policy is to raise prices, (b) they have no complaint if price to all consumers is the same.I doubt whether you can leave producer-manufacturers to be dealt with by International Committee. Both they and other producers will want to know where they stand.I think that they should make their case nationally before their National Producers&apos; Committee.
This is surely necessary, because each administering Government has to allot quotas before scheme starts.Campbell and Hay should be on secret committee, but I foresee difficulties unless Hay can report secretly to his small committee.If scheme adopted earliest possible date desirable.Caldecott knows this.I see great difficulties in temporary export tax, but if Colijn guarantees that export will not be exceeded, and excess rubber will be destroyed, I think we cannot refuse to accept his undertaking.If scheme is to be turned down I think it essential it should be turned down by rubber producers and not by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Otherwise Government will get odium of refusing restriction when the whole industry want it and believe it can be worked.Your letter of the 22nd February just received. On no account should rubber producers sign agreement which does not include whole proposals for dealing with Dutch native rubber.It was agreed with Hay that British producers must take responsibility of vetting Dutch scheme and of recommending it to His Majesty&apos;s Government. In view of difficulties inherent in new Dutch native proposals, this is more necessary than ever.We have always maintained and must maintain that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment can only consider complete scheme presented by industry and certified by them to be in their opinion practicable and supported by large majority of producers.Cabinet should have this immediately.o
