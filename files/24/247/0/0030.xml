THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS:-BRITANNIC&apos; MAJESTY&apos;&apos;8 rGOVERNMENT.C A B I N.EJi\, 2-*SECRET. &quot; Copy No. &apos;CP. 50(34).----    R1jGU:LAa,I0H    op    7AGS3    IN    THE    MANUFACTURINGSECTION    OF    THE    COTTON    INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1.      In reply to a recent joint deputation of representatives of the Cotton Spinners&apos;  and Manufacturers&apos; Association and of the Weavers&apos; Amalgamation I promised to place before my colleagues their desire that legislative action should, he taken to make agreed working conditions binding throughout the manufacturing section of the industry.      I attach a copy of the statement made by Mr. John Grey,  the employers&apos;  chairman.     Mr. Andrew Naesmith, on&quot; behalf of the operatives, made a similar statement. 2.     Although these organisations represent a substantial majority of employers and employed,  their position as the authorities for the constitutional settlement of working conditions has been steadily weakened by the action of employers who have operated lower conditions,  taking advantage of the weakness of the operatives in the depressed circumstances of the industry.    This has occurred mainly in respect of mills engaged in the manufacture of plainer cloths but its effects have been felt throughout the industry with the result that employers who wish to maintain the constitutional joint arrangements and to remain loyal to agreements are having to face the alternative of sacrificing their business or of ceasing to observe agreed conditions.    The general effect of this undercutting of wages and of selling prices is to impoverish the industry without increasing its total volume of business.    It has been, also, a serious handicap to those who have sought to reduce costs by higher technical efficiency and better management rather than by reducing wages and the effect has been to weaken the financial position of the industry and to cause increasing labour unrest.
3.      It will be remembered that one of the most difficult obstacles in the way of settlement of the dispute at the end of last year was the question of the reinstatement of operatives who had left work rather than continue at wages below agreed rates, the employers&apos;  organisations being unable to take any effective action to prevent the undercutting of wages.      Although a large proportion of these were reinstated as the result of the agreement made in settlement of the dispute,  a sufficient number failed to secure re-employment to cause other operatives to accept lower conditions during the past few months in fear of displacement.     In some cases they have retained or secured employment only by payment of sums of    25 upwards to employers in addition to working under lower than agreement conditions, thus enabling business to be taken from employers able and willing to observe those conditions.4.     Negotiations for the revision of existing wages lists in order to remove anomalies and to make the necessary adjustments in the Uniform List in relation to the More Looms Agreement have been impeded by the fact that the employers cannot assure the unions that any new agreements reached will not also be broken.      This is causing Independent action by individual employers and the whole situation is leading towards the breaking up of the employers&apos;  organisations.     All the Darwen mills are at the present time in danger of being stopped by a case of this kindo     While this would give added force to the extreme section of the operatives,  it would be a still further obstacle to that co-operation within the industry which is its chief need at the present time.     Moreover, In such circumstances, a situation might soon arise in which the Government would find it impossible to avoid taking some action in respect of the regulation of working conditionso
5*      It can be argued, therefore,  that if, without assuming financial responsibility or the duty of enforcement of wages such as are involved In connection with Trade Boards,  a Bimple method cculd be found of enabling agreed rates to be given effect by Order in this section of the cotton industry,  there is a case for acceding to the request of the organisations end so enabling them to have again the authority which ohey used to possess before the depression.      It can be assumed,  in considering the matter,  that provision would have to be made for the proper consideration of objections to the enforcement of particular conditions end that action could only be taken on conditions acceptable to and agreed by the appropriate organisations in the industry.6.      As my colleagues are aware general legislation of this character has hitherto been opposed by employers&apos;  and workers&apos; organisations in the majority of industries.      It is still the case that most industries do not desire action but I understand that neither the National Confederation of Employers&apos;  Organisations nor the Trades Union Congress would offer opposition in this case.      There are three or four other industries which have actively sought such powers and. owing to changed circumstances in regard to effectiveness of organisation, it is undoubtedly the case that there are industries in which the maintenance of voluntary agreements is being seriously threatened,  and that, in these Industries,, the desire for statutory action is growing. If legislation for the Cotton Manufacturing Industry was regarded as en experiment^ the Government could reasonably require experience of its operation to be awaited before considering other cases.7.      The cotton industry has long occupied a special position as, while it has been made clear in many Government statements that the responsibility for action must rest mainly upon those
engaged in the industry,  it has been indicated that the Government would be prepared to reader such supplementary assistance as might be necessary and the deputation made it clear that they regarded the present circumstances as justifying such assistance.      The alternative,  in the opinion of the deputation, would bo the breaking up of the organisations and the virtual destruction of agreements.      I have no reason to doubt the probability of such a development having regard to the circumstances of the industry and,  on this ground alone,  the proposal for legislation requires the most careful consideration,(Intld)      H:*Bo9th February, 1934.4C
MR. GREY:    First of all, I desire to thank you for so readily agreeing to meet us,  and particularly when -we bear in mind the fact that you have come to meet us at- no little personal inconvenience to yourself,  and at a time when you might have been enjoying some little respite from the cares and worries of office.The situation that has led to our coming here is one of the utmost difficulty,  and I do not think I over-stress it when I say it is one of serious gravity for the cotton industry.    In the first place, may I point out that we are here as a joint delegation representing the Weavers&apos; Amalgamation, on the one hand, and the Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers&apos; Association on the other,  to lay before you our case for the cotton manufacturing or the weaving side of the industry.     V/e are not concerned,  in what we arc putting before you to-day, with the spinning section of the industry, or with any other of the allied parts of the industry,  such as finishing and bleaching, dyeing and printing, we are merely here representing the weaving section, but it is in that section in which there is by far the greatest amount of what cannot be better described than as sheer piracy on the part of employers as regards the operatives&apos; wages,  and it is causing the greatest amount of insecurity and dislocation, and it is for that reason we have come to put our case to you.We have bad this trouble now for a year or two, but it has become much more acute during the last six or nine months, or certainly,  say, during the last twelve months.    I think we would all accept the view that tho strongest defence for wages agreements is a well-organised, powerful Trade Union,  and with our past history that is proved to be the case.   Whenever we have been able to reach agreements with our workpoople on wages oonditions, notwithstanding whatever difficulty and
contention there may have been in arriving at our conclusions, those conclusions, -when arrived at, have in the main been honourably observed and carried out.    I am not placing it so low as to say that a strong Union has been the sole reason; there has been a sense of honourable obligation,  and behind that there has always been the knowledge that strong Trade Union action would keep in line those who might have desired to be recalcitrant had they been able to get away with it-    But now conditions are entirely changed, the Unions are not in that position where they can, without incurring grave responsibility to those whom they may lead into strike action, compel the observance of agreements as they have been able to do in times past,  and the temptations to break those agreements are infinitely greater than ever they v/ere - trade is bad,  the volume of trade in insufficient to employ the machinery that we have or the operatives who are seeking work,  there is an enormous number of people unemployed, those who have work are desperately afre.id of losing it, and those who have not work are exceedingly anxious to obtain it,  and that is a situation that people, many of whom would regard themselves and have been regarded as honourable     people,      are succumbing to, to the temptation to take advantage of the operatives&apos; weakness and in an endeavour to secure business to get it on the basis of paying something less for their labour than the agreed rate of v/ages.   Well, you can seo that that is a condition that spreads very rapidly,  and in a state of trado where the total supply is utterly inadequate to meet all tho machinery demands and all the labour d emands, we are very rapidly approaching a condition of chaos, where no man knows on what basis a competitor may bo estimating his wages rates,  and that is a situation which is being exploited by every buyer of cloth on the Manchester Royal Exchange.
Now, we are a very intimate industry - that is one of our weaknesses.      Tie know far too much of what each other is doing.      It is the easiest thing in the world to buy from the Lancashire cotton industry.      The Royal Exchange is a great advantage, but it has its disadvantages;    it makes it far too easy for a man who wishes to exploit and find out the weakest buyer to do so with the minimum of effort, and when your weakest buyer happens at the same time possibly to be weak in his principles as well as in his desire for work, then that is an opportunity that every buyer is searching for, and it is those people who can undercut who are getting business, and other people who desire to remain faithful to wages agreements are finding their machinery becoming idle.MINISTER OF LABOUR:    You said the weakest buyer, but I think you mean the weakest seller.MR. GREY:      Yes, Sir,  the weakest seller.      Well, we have been considering this matter for some time.      We discussed that question very thoroughly during our wages dispute, which resulted in the Midland Agreement, in August of 1932, Mr. Leggett, whose time we have teken up far too much in our disputes in Lancashire during the last year or two, knows that that was one aspect of the question with which we were most seriously concerned, not only to reach agreements but to be assured, when those agreements were reached,  that they would be carried out and observed.      Well, as I say, things have gone materially worse during the last year.     We have been endeavouring, the operatives and ourselves,  or at least we, as employers, have been endeavouring to persuade the operatives to consider some revision of the rates of payment and some what we call simplification but which they say is a reduction. There is truth in both statements, hut we have been, as I say, discussing this matter with the operatives, and the operatives
cj.ui.te logically - and I think it is the attitude that I should have taken up myself - have turned round to us and said, &quot;What is the use of entering into any farther agreements if you cannot give us an assurance that those agreements, v/hen entered into, on whatever &quot;basis, will be observed?&quot;, and we cannot give that assurance.      They,  on their side, cannot give the assurance that if they entered into an agreement their people would observe it. They cannot control tneir operatives, we cannot control the employers,  therefore we have come definitely to this conclusion, that the Government must give that measure of protection to the industry in this respect that the industry cannot give itself, and that is the reason why we are here, Sir, to speak to you to-day.     Y/e have been discussing, at several meetings lately, this question of the legalisation or the legal enforcement of wages agreements,      We put forward to the operatives, at our meeting a few weeks ago, our proposals that we should ask you    to secure the assent of the Government to present to Parliament an Enabling Bill that would give you authority, when such Bill became law, to make obligatory any wages agreements which we jointly requested you so to do.      How,  the operatives&apos; view was that v/e should come and ask you to get through Parliament a Bill that made all wages agreements obligatory as existing now.      We did not go so far as that, but we had a further meeting, and afte some discussion - I do not know whether one could safely say that we got nearer together, I think we did - I put this point to the operatives, and they entirely agreed that we had reached a degree of unanimity on the desirability of legal action being taken, that before we proceeded any further to discuss the matter in detail we should come to see you, Sir, and make an application to you for some measure of legal protection, and get your guidance and your advice as to what you thought was the best way and method for that legal protection to be given.V      - ill
MINISTER OP LABOUR:    But you do not ask my advice.      I mean you are not asking my advice,  surely,  as to whether airy particular agreement, existing agreement,  should he the agreement which you now propose to enforce?     That is entirely a matter for you,  is it not?MR.  GREY:      No,  what we have come really to ask you is this -are we talking in the dark when we are talking about legalisation of wages agreements,  or have we an assurance that the Government will give protection to wages agreements if we ask them so to do.MINISTER OP LABOURS      Yes,   I fellow now.MR. GREY;      Therefore we say that before we talk any further we had better see you and get to know hew far the Government is prepared to act  along the lines that we are discussing,  cr along other lines which they may suggest as a better alternative,, We have in mind,  Sir, the statements that have been made by responsible Ministers from time to time,  and particularly during the last few months.      We also have in mind that there was a Government enquiry into the condition of the cotton industry some years ago when the Government did pledge itself in a considerable measure to do its utmost to give effect to any joint requests that the industry might make.      That is why,  Sir, we are here to-day.      As I say,  the employers&apos;  idea is an Enabling Bill with a schedule which you could fill in as and when requested.      There would have to be a question probably of geographical limitation,  as to how much of the country that Bill should cover.      The manufacturing section of the industry, as you know,  is highly concentrated so far as the geographical area is concerned;    unfortunately so,  in the present condition of the trade.      You can take it that we are sincere as employers just as the operatives are in this application to you for legal assistance which we are now asking the Government to
implement in the promises that they have given previously.      I think the condition is such. that the Government must face it and handle it courageously and not with any undue timidity.      I do not think I can overstross the unfortunate aspect of this side of our industry ana the evil consequences that    it is having all the way through.&quot;,7e hoar a great deal,   Sir,  about cur industry needing some measure of re-organisation.      Well, we ere&apos; convinced of this, that before any re-organisation can take place,  and any improve-ment in the industry can take place, the first essential is that there must be a stable foundation on wages rotes,  that there must be equity right through,  and that there must be honourable observance   of those wages when agreements have been come to by those two sides that represent the responsible parties to the industry on the employing and operative sides, and for that reason,  Sir,  we are hero to-day to ask you how far you are prepared to go to meet this application that we are putting to you,  and give us that support that unfortunately wo cannot exercise ourselves.Now, that is all I wish to say at the moment,   Sir henry. Mr. Naosmith will supplement what I have said.
