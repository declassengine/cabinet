[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1934. SECRET. Copy. No......&quot;CP. 28 (34).CABINET.THE SITUATION IN INDIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.Now that the protracted period of three years&apos; co-operation with the Indian delegates has come to an end, my colleagues may find it useful to have a general survey of Indian affairs. So long as the Joint Select Committee is sitting, it is, of course, difficult for them to deal in their speeches with the details of the White Paper. None the less, it seemed to me that it would be extremely helpful to all of us if they could keep Indian questions in their proper focus before any audiences that they might be addressing, and that, this being so, the best material with which I could provide them would be a comparison of the state of affairs when the National Govern-ment came into office with the situation that has been created by a constant adherence to the dual policy of resolute administration and constitutional advance. I need not say that the last impression that I wish to create is that of complacency. The Indian situation is always apt to change with almost kaleidoscopic rapidity. Nor do I wish this paper to be regarded in any way as an apologia pro vita mea during the last two-and-a-half years. Rather is it an effective justification of Government action both in India and in London, and a reassuring introduction to the next chapter upon which we shall be engaged when in the spring or early summer the Joint Select Committee makes its report.There is nothing in the&apos;Memorandum that is confidential except the reference to the Treasury guarantee for the purchase of the cotton crops and the reference to the relief to be given to Bengal in this year&apos;s Indian Budget. My colleagues, if they so wish, can, with these exceptions, use any of the details contained in it as they think fit.S. H.India office,3rd February 1934.Review of the Indian Situation, 1931-33.Civil Disobedience.In the field of Law and Order the dual policy of pressing on with the proposals for constitutional reform, and at the same time suppressing with a firm hand the illegal activities of Congress, which has been steadily pursued for the last two years, has met with marked success. It will be remembered that when Mr. Gandhi arrived back in India on the 28th December 1931, after the second Round Table Conference, he found that his hand had been forced by the action of his followers, who had started a no-rent agitation in the United Provinces and a similar movement by the Red Shirts in the North-West Frontier Province in flagrant violation of the Irwin-Gandhi Pact. To enable the authorities to deal with these movements the Governor-General had been compelled to issue Ordinances containing special powers. When the Viceroy made it clear that he was not prepared to discuss with Mr. Gandhi the necessity for these measures and for measures taken against terrorism in Bengal, the Congress issued an ultimatum under the threat of civil disobedience, demanding that Government should take certain action which they knew to be impossible. The Government immediately took up the challenge. Ordinances applicable to all parts of India were promulgated giving Local Governments all the powers used against the civil disobedience movement in 1930 and in addition the special powers of detention without trial and of controlling the movements of suspects, which had already been applied in the United Provinces and North-West Frontier Province. Mr. Gandhi and all important leaders were at once arrested. The initiative thus taken was maintained, with results which have been better than might have been expected. The Congress programme was disorganised and the movement  prevented  from  obtaining  momentum.    In  the North-West Frontier2537      60   2.34
Province the assistance of troops had to be invoked in the early days, but the situation soon became quiet and the only further disturbances of importance occurred in April at the time of the elections to the newly created Legislative Council. Forcible action against riotous mobs was necessary in many other places also, and not infrequently the Police were obliged to resort to firing, especially in Bihar and Orissa, where for a time the movement took the form of organised attacks on Govern-ment buildings, especially police stations. The success attending the demonstrative side of the Congress programme decreased, however, as time went on, and, generally speaking, it is true to say that in this phase of the civil disobedience movement Law and Order was never seriously threatened even in the storm centre of Bombay. The number of convicted persons in jail reached the peak figure of 32,458 in April 1932. From that time onwards the total steadily declined and by the end of 1932 it had dropped to 14,815. i .Welcome evidence of the changed attitude of public opinion towards the civil disobedience movement was shown in the fact that at the end of 1932 the Central and the Provincial Legislatures endorsed the policy of Government by passing, by sub-stantial majorities, Acts replacing the special powers previously taken by Ordinance. A year before, the Ordinances had been introduced amidst widespread protest and discontent. We were told that we were permanently alienating large sections of the population. Yet an extension of the drastic provisions of the Ordinances, to the extent to which the Executive Governments considered necessary, was obtained by the vote of the Legislatures throughout India without resort to certification. This is a remarkable fact and surpassed our expectations at the time.By the beginning of 1933 civil disobedience was already at a very low ebb, and Mr. Gandhi, who still remained in jail, had started to concentrate his attention mainly on the removal of untouchability. His example was followed by a number of important members of Congress, who found in that work a substitute for defiant opposition to Government. The year 1933 has been entirely devoid of incident and has passed without any serious disturbances either of -a communal nature or in connection with the civil disobedience campaign. An abortive attempt was made to hold a session of Congress in Calcutta in March, but this was frustrated by the authorities without any difficulty and it proved a complete fiasco. In the North-West Frontier Province the Red Shirt movement, which in 1930-31 had proved a serious menace to authority, almost entirely collapsed, and in September, out of 4,447 Red Shirts listed in the Peshawar Tehsil no fewer than 3,566 publicly renounced their connection with the movement. Later, in December 175 Red Shirts from the Mutena area voluntarily presented themselves before the Deputy Superintendent of Police and swore to remain loyal to the Government in future.The main difficulty which the authorities had to deal with was presented by Mr. Gandhi&apos;s own personal mancevres. In May he started one of his periodical fasts, which he stated was solely concerned with his movement for the improvement of the position of the Depressed Classes. During the fast he was released, but little general interest was aroused, and the chief immediate result was the suspension of civil disobedience during and for six weeks after the fast. In July a meeting of Congress leaders was held at Poona, but the only result was that civil disobedience was still declared to be the policy of Congress. Consequently, when Mr. Gandhi subsequently asked the Viceroy for an interview to discuss the situation this was refused. In the following month Mr. Gandhi, after disbanding his ashram, announced his intention of embarking on a march through the district of Kaira to show his sympathy with the villagers most hit by Governments action to suppress civil disobedience. He had, he said, no desire to invite the villagers to mass civil disobedience, but individuals would be invited to offer individual civil disobedience. To have allowed this march to take place might have caused a serious revival of the movement, not only in the Bombay Presidency, but elsewhere. He and his followers were therefore arrested before the march started and he was removed to Poona. After a few days he was released but served with an order not to leave Poona. He at once defied this order and was therefore prosecuted and sentenced to a year&apos;s simple imprisonmeut. His arrest, which effectively prevented any trouble in the Ahmedabad area, caused little interest and there were no demonstrations such as took place when he was arrested in 1930. Mr. Gundhi next put forward a claim that he should have, as a convicted prisoner, exactly the same facilities to carry on his anti-untouchability campaign as had been allowed him as a State prisoner the year before when the movement was first inaugurated. He was offered by Government facilities which were ample to enable him to make effective contribution to his anti-untouchability work, but he refused this offer
and started yet another fast. On this occasion he was allowed to continue his fast in jail until his health reached the danger zone, when he was released on the 23rd August. After an interval for recuperation he once more considered his position. Realising that if he restarted civil disobedience activities and returned to jail he would be committed to another fast, he announced that he would not court imprisonment by aggressive civil disobedience until the period for which he was sentenced to imprisonment had expired. In pursuance of this decision he has handed over the direction of civil disobedience to his lieutenant Jahawarlal Nehru, and is now engaged on an all-India tour in prosecutiou of his movement for the uplift of the untouchables. None of these activities of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s has aroused any general interest and the present indications are that his tour is by no means the success for which he hoped.As the result of the   waning  interest  in  the civil  disobedience  campaign, Government were able to embark on a policy of speeding up the release of prisoners. This policy has been carried out steadily throughout the year, with the result that at the end of December the total of convicted prisoners still in jail had dropped to 2,778. These releases have caused no embarrassment to Local Governments, and those released, with few exceptions, have shown no inclination to court a further period in jail by renewed activities.   There have, on the other hand, been indications of a growing revolt among members of Congress against  the barren policy of civil disobedience to which Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Nehru still cling, and there is now a considerable body of Congress members who are anxious to abandon civil disobedience altogether and to concentrate on securing power in the new Constitution.   No one yet, however, has been strong enough to challenge Mr. Gandhi&apos;s hold over Congress.   lie still dominates it and dictates its official policy.   His view apparently is that un-conditional withdrawal of civil disobedience would mean absolute surrender and humiliation, and he is determined not to withdraw from a movement with which his own personal reputation is so closely identified unless he can secure from Government terms which approximate to those of the Irwin-Gandhi Pact of 1931.   Council entry and acceptance of office are, therefore, anathema to him, and he probably intends to play a waiting game in the hope that sooner or later a suitable opportunity will present itself for him to organise another civil disobedience campaign such an opportunity, for example, as might occur if any substantial alteration of the White Paper Scheme were followed by an agitation in India.   For the moment he appears to recognise the strength of Governments position and is unwilling that Congress should fritter away its energies on useless and provocative activities.The improvement in the internal situation has its counterpart in other directions also. During the latter part of last year Sir F. Sykes made a farewell tour in the Province, and the welcome which he received, even in villages situated in the districts that had previously been the strongholds of the civil disobedience movement, provided striking evidence of the change that had taken place in the attitude of public opinion towards Government. As for the campaign for the boycott of British goods, that is to all intents and purposes dead.The frank exchange of views with the representatives of India and Burma, both at the Round Table Conferences and at the Joint Select Committee, has done much to create a better spirit in India. Misconceptions have been removed and the suspicion and distrust of our policy in regard to the reforms, so evident a year or so ago, have slowly, but very surely, given way to a feeling of greater hopefulness and confidence.Not only in the political and administrative spheres, but also in that of social relationships, have we witnessed a remarkable change. Two years ago it was considered inadvisable, owing to the activities of political agitators, to send a M.C.C. team to India. But in December last, Bombay, the former stronghold of non-co-operation, civil disobedience, and boycott, treated our team with the greatest courtesy, and over a quarter of a million spectators attended the first, Test Match. The Press paid many tributes to the enthusiasm, sportsmanship and impartiality of the crowds, in which the colleges and schools were well represented. The same may be said of the second Test Match at Calcutta.The change of feeling is further illustrated by the fact that all the members of the Bombay Legislative Council recently joined to give Sir Frederick Sykes a farewell dinner, and by the very cordial atmosphere at dinners given to me by more than 25 members of the Indian Legislature who were in London in the summer, and later by the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly.
Terrorism.The year 1931 was one of the darkest in the history of terrorist crime. The Chittagong Armoury Raid in the spring of 1930 bad been the opening blow in a campaign which is not yet over, and terrorist activity had spread steadily in Bengal throughout 1930, during which year 36 outrages were committed. In the early months of 1931 the same tendency was intensified, and by July 1931 it was evident that existing legislation (even including the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act, re-enacted in 1930, which gives.powers of preventive detention and provides for trial by special Commissioners of terrorist accused) was insufficient to cope with the menace. Soon after the assumption of power by the National Government, further measures were carried through; one was a Press Act prohibiting incitement to murder or violence in the public Press, and another the Bengal Emergency Powers Ordinance (later the Suppression of Terrorist Outrages Act), under which, inter alia, wide powers were given to the District Magistrate of Chittagong (where there was virtually a reign of terror) to commandeer property, impose collective fines, regulate traffic and transport, &amp;c. With the promulgation of this Ordinance a combined attack was made on the forces of terrorism in the Chittagong district by police and military.Thus, by the end of 1931, though, the number of outrages in the year had risen to the formidable total of 66, an offensive campaign by Government had been begun. The police were armed with a reasonable supply of legislative weapons, and the Chittagong situation (where it had not even yet been possible to round up absconding participants in the Armoury Raid of 18 months before) was being tackled.There was no immediate improvement, and the total of outrages in 1932 was even higher, at 75, than that of the previous year. But in 1933 the tide began to turn. In the first six months the total of outrages dropped to 12, and while in the later months, for which figures are not yet available, there were several serious crimes, including the murder of Mr. Bvirge, it is an undeniable fact that the number of terrorist enterprises which came to fruition had very considerably declined.There were also, during 1933, many important arrests of terrorist leaders. In January a widespread conspiracy in Calcutta was unearthed and about 25 arrests made. In February Surgya Sen, described as &quot; the most wanted criminal in Bengal,&quot; whose participation in the Armoury Raid was only one item in a catalogue of terrorist crime, was run to earth. In May there followed the arrests of Dinesh Mozumdar, who escaped from jail in 1930 after his conviction for attempting to murder Sir Charles Tegart; the woman, Kalpana Dutt, who took part in the Armoury Raid of 1930 ; and other leaders who had been consistently active in promoting terrorist crime. These important successes heartened the police, who have continued to maintain pressure with satisfactory results, particularly in regard &quot;to the recovery of terrorist weapons and ammunition. There has been a great improvement in the quantity of information which the Police have been able to obtain about the movements and activities of terrorists. This is always a sign of an improvement in the position as it implies confidence as to the eventual success of the Government.Although, however, it is clear there has been real progress in suppressing outward manifestations of terrorist activity, expert opinion is unanimous that the back of terrorism has not been broken. It is pointed owt that while fewer outrages occur, a very large number are only prevented by police vigilance ; and that while, as is undoubtedly the case, public opinion is much less critical of Government^ &quot;repression&quot; than formerly, there is, especially among middle-class youths (largely unemployed) and the student comnrunities, an enormous body of latent hostility which makes good soil for the terrorist seed.Only qualified optimism is therefore possible about the situation resulting from the efforts, signally successful in themselves, of the last two and a half years. But there may perhaps be for the future a larger hope. A notable departure in policy has been made by Sir John Anderson&apos;s Government. Until the end of 1933 our policy was largely negative. We were almost entirely concerned with the task of stopping holes. But Sir John Anderson&apos;s speech at. the St. Andrews Day Dinner in Calcutta, followed by the appointment of an Economic Commission, foreshadows for the future a dual policy. The Government of Bengal are at present introducing still more rigorous legislative measures to hinder terrorist activity, and the preventive police pressure which has recently been so successful will- be unremittingly maintained. But the Government are now also turning their attention to a long term policy of economic development which, if it gives employment for unemployed youth, may eventually
help to solve the problem, by making a place in the economic structure of the Presidency for many of the youths who otherwise would have found an outlet for their energy in terrorist crime. It is proposed to give the finances of Bengal some much needed relief from the Centre in this year&apos;s Budget.&apos;3Recruitment for the Indian Services.Candidates of the required standard have continued to present themselves in sufficient numbers for appointment to the Indian Services. The average number of European candidates who sat for the open competitive examinations held in London during the past three years was 87 in the case of the Indian Civil Service, and 84 in the case of the Indian Police, as compared with averages of 94 and 70 respectively for the five preceding years. In the case of the Police the results have been entirely satisfactory, both as to the numbers of European recruits obtained and their quality. In the case of the Indian Civil Service the quality of the European recruits has been fully up to the standard, but owing to the operation of the open competitive system which is laid down by statute, we are not, at present, getting quite as many as we should desire. The proposal in the White Paper which bears upon this point would enable us to remove the defect in the system which, at present, hinders us from getting the full number of European recruits for the Indian Civil Service, and we should then, on the basis of recent experience, expect to find the supply satisfactory both as to quantity and quality. As regards the Indian Medical Service, there has been a definite improvement in the recruitment of European officers so far as numbers are concerned, and, on the whole, the quality of the candidates has also improved. The number (35) appointed in 1933 was the largest for any year since the Avar.Economic Relations.While there has been a great improvement in the political and administrative spheres, there has been also a remarkable change in the economic relations of India and the United Kingdom. Indian opinion is steeped in the belief that the object of British policy is economic exploitation, and the greatest care had to be used to secure Indian support for participation in the Ottawa Conference. By scrupulous respect for the spirit of the Tariff Autonomy Convention we were able to secure a satisfactory agreement at Ottawa, which, after a period of some anxiety, was ratified by the Indian Legislature by a substantial majority. The results up to date have been definitely encouraging.In the case of imports into the United Kingdom from India, the position is complicated by the fact that several of the preferences were brought into effect from the 1st March 1932 and other dates before the 1st January 1933, when the Ottawa Agreement came into force. The share of the total imports into the United Kingdom coming from India was in the first nine months of 1931, 3 &quot;96 per cent. ; in the corre-sponding months of 1932, 4&quot;2 per cent. ; and in the corresponding months of 1933, 5 per cent.A case in which the benefit of the Ottawa Agreement to India is very clearly seen is linseed, of which the imports from India in the first 11 months of 1933 rose to 109,387 tons from 7,717 tons in the corresponding period of the previous year, with a corresponding fall in imports from other countries. There were also satisfactory, though moderate, increases in such important commodities as rice and tobacco, and the Indian share of the tea imports into the United.Kingdom, after a decline to 52 per cent, in 1931, rose to 53 per cent, in 1932 and remained at the same figure in 1933.On the other side of the account (imports into India from the United Kingdom) the tendeucy is towards a marked improvement in the British share of the import trade. The total imports are reduced, but the British share over comparable periods of 1932 and 1933 rose from 35&apos; 7 to 41&quot; 1. The improvement is well spread over a variety of items (such as cutlery, earthenware, hardware, paints, boots and shoes, woollen piece-goods, provisions and pneumatic tyres). The outstanding example is motor cars, lorries, &amp;c, which rose from 23 lakhs in a period of six months in 1932 to 54 lakhs in the corresponding period in 1933. His Majesty&apos;s Senior Trade Commissioner in a Report published in December last, says: &quot;The advantageous effects of the Ottawa preferences are becoming more apparent as time goes on, aud it is confidently anticipated that when the import trade attains normal proportions, the fiscal advantages secured by the United Kingdom will prove most beneficial.&quot;* This should nob he referred to iu public until the Indian Budget has been introduced at the end of February.
The Ottawa Agreement in itself conferred no benefit on the British cotton trade except in respect of some quite minor items. An indirect result of the Agreement has, however, been to change for the better the whole attitude of the Government of India towards this important trade. The Ottawa Agreement says : &quot; The Government of India will consider in the light of the findings of the Tariff Board the protective duties to be imposed on goods of cotton and artificial silk according as they are made in the U.K. or elsewhere . . .&quot; Shortly after the Agreement was signed the Indian Tariff Board made recommendations which, if accepted, would have placed British cotton goods on almost the same footing as foreign cotton goods. The Government of India have not acted on the recommendations of this Report. In the course of their negotiations with Japan they have stabilised the duty on foreign cotton goods at a level 25 per cent.* above that on British goods ; and there is a possibility that this difference may later be increased to 30 per cent. A still more valuable result of the improved relations between the two countries is in the fact that the quota given to Japan under the new Trade Agreement is so regulated as to reduce Japanese imports of certain qualities of goods in which her competition has been specially damaging to the United Kingdom.The imports of Japanese cotton piece goods into India will be limited for the next three years to a maximum of 325 to 400 million yards per annum, varying according to the amount of Indian raw cotton imported into Japan. This compares with more than 550 million yards imported from Japan in 1032. Moreover, the total quota is subdivided into four sections of Grey, Bordered Grey, Bleached and Coloured goods. Of these the most important from Lancashire&apos;s point of view is bleached, of which the new quota allows Japan to import a maximum of 38*4 million yards compared with a growing import of 54 million yards in 1931 and 110 million yards in 1932. This arrangement may undoubtedly be regarded as satisfactory from the British point of view. It would have been more satisfactory had India been to anything like the same extent dependent on the British market for the disposal of her raw cotton as she is upon the Japanese market. It certainly would not have been secured without the guarantee! which the Cabinet authorised me to give as to the financing of the cotton crop, and which played a decisive part at the critical stage of the negotiations. The strength of the Japanese position was due to the dependence of India upon the Japanese market for the disposal of her raw cotton. The Lancashire industry appears to realise this and is actively engaged in trying to remedy the situation. The Indo-Japanese negotiations point to the necessity for increasing the consumption of Indian raw cotton in this country, and more generally to the great importance of anything which tends to tie up the economic interests of Great Britain and India as closely as possible.There have also been conversations&quot; between representatives of the cotton industries of the two countries, of which a Report of the India Section of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce says: &quot;The cotton industries of (he two countries had established an understanding which, if properly developed, would serve them well for many years to come.&quot; Now that the Japanese negotiations are finished we are engaged in the process of clearing up the situation for the benefit of British trade. The result may not give satisfaction to the excessive expectations of some sections of the Lancashire industry. But it ought to meet with the approval of those who face the facts squarely and appreciate the gravity of what might easily have happened if the political and economic tendencies of a year or two ago had developed unchecked.Indian Finance and Credit.A further notable feature of the last two and a half years has been the achievement and maintenance of a very great improvement in the credit of India. In the late summer of 1931 Indian credit was at a very low ebb and the financial outlook generally appeared almost desperate. A loan of about  15 millions was due for repayment in January 1932, and the total of sterling loans, including this one, maturing within the next seven years amounted in the aggregate to no less than  67 millions. On the other hand, between January and May 1931 public issues aggregating  52.millions, including  5 millions for conversion purposes, had been* It was fox- a time 50 per cent, above (75 per cent, against 25 per cent.), but the cutting down of the Japanese imports by the quota system made the 75 per cent, duty on foreign goods unnecessary fox-any pnrpose.t No public allusion should be made to this gurmuitee.
--made on the London market. Even if the market had continued a willing lender it would not have been in accordance with sound financial principles or common prudence to continue borrowing on such a scale indefinitely ; but, in fact, the London market and the investing public had already become alive to the position, and the issue in May 1931 of  10 millions India 6 per cent. Bonds of only two and a half to three and a half years&apos; currency had, in the main, to be taken up by the underwriters and fell before long to an appreciable discount. The estimates for the year showed, in spite of the new taxation which had been imposed in the Budget for 1931-32, the prospect of a serious deficit ; the balance of trade was far from satisfactory ; and substantial inroads had had to be made on the sterling currency reserves for the purpose of supporting the rupee, and as a consequence of this the Gold Standard Reserve holding in London, normally maintained at  -10 millions, had dropped by the end of September 1931 to  12 &quot;1 millions,The two events which marked the turning point were : (1) the introduction of a supplementary budget in September 1931 containing fresh emergency taxation measures associated with further drastic retrenchment, including a cut in the pay of the Services ; and(2) the decision to allow the rupee to remain linked with sterling when the latter left gold.The result of the budgetary measures was that the inevitable deficit of 1931-32 was greatly reduced, and the Budget Estimates for 1932-33 provided for a substantial surplus of revenue over expenditure, which was, in fact, realised. As regards the current financial year, the Budget, after allowing for the remission of half the pay cut, provided for a nominal surplus, and, while the intensification of the depression and its adverse effect on public revenues makes it clear that this will not be realised, enough has already been done to make it evident to the public that the finances of India, unlike those of many countries at the present time, are being managed with a real determination to make both ends meet and with a substantial measure of success.It may be remarked that the Indian Budget for 1933-34 provided for what has been generally considered an excessive charge against revenue for debt reduction. If this allocation is suspended or cut down substantially, as the hard times would justifj7, a surplus will be shown.As a result of the decision to allow the rupee to remain linked to sterling the pressure on the exchange, which constituted a serious menace to the rupee, was relieved, and in fact the tide of exchange turned in the opposite direction, so that between October 1931 and the third week of January 1934 Government secured sterling-remittance to the extent of  103,250,000, of which  18,750,000 has been added to the Gold Standard Reserve in London for the purpose of fortifying the exchange and currency position. Another result of this decision was the beginning of substantial private exports of gold from India, the total by now amounting to over  125 millions in value. This process has more than counteracted the relative weakness in the favourable balance of trade in merchandise, so that India&apos;s balance of payments, including treasure, has actually been more favourable during the last two or three years than in any of the years immediately preceding.The combined effect of the improvement of Indian credit springing from the above causes and of the fortification of the sterling resource position, has been that it has been possible to pay off without difficulty the various maturing sterling obligations. Not only was the  15 millions outstanding of the loan maturing in January 1932 repaid without resort to fresh borrowing, but since then the  6 millions of 6 per cent. Bonds, 1932-33, the  7 millions of (5 per cent. Bonds, 1933-35, and the  10 millions of 6 per cent. Bonds, 1933-34, have all been extinguished by repay-ment on the earliest possible redemption date in each case. The process has been assisted by the raising of fresh sterling loans, but these, which were in each case over-subscribed, were of relatively Jong date and on a much lower interest basis than the short-term issues which they replaced.Simultaneously, great progress has been made in India with the repayment and conversion of short-term rupee debt. Five important loan transactions, largely designed for funding or conversion purposes, have been completed and, as in the case of the sterling loans, the basis of borrowing has been steadily reduced. Moreover, an important reduction has been made in the floating debt in India, the amount of Indian Treasury Bills outstanding with the public having been reduced since the -end of August 1931 from Rs. 84 crores to about lls. 32 crores.
If the improvement in India&apos;s credit is measured by the usual method of noting the change in the prices of typical stocks it will be seen that the 3^- per cent. Sterling Stock has risen from 42 in September 1931 to about 88 in January 1934, while the 4  per cent. Sterling Stock, 1950-55, has in the same period risen from 61 to about 108.The fundamental assumption upon which the White Paper proposals for the transfer of financial responsibility are based is that, before the first Federal Ministry comes into being, a Reserve Bank, free from political influence, will have been set up by Indian legislation, and be already successfully operating. It is clear evidence of the improved political situation in India that the necessary Bill has already jiassed the Legislative Assembly in a form generally satisfactory to Government, and will, it is hoped, shortly be disposed of by the Council of State. This Bill, it should be remembered, embodies provisions to secure the independence of the Bank similar to those which were rejected by the Assembly in 1927-28. The progress so far made is thus very significant and gratifying.
