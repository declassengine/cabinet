(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC majesty.S GOVERNMENT)CABINET. &amp; 6 9CENTRAL ELECTRICITY BOARD. Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.SECRET COPY NO,CP. 45(34).1. Now that the Electricity Grid is substantiallyconstructed and working,  it is found, as might be expected, that there are certain directions in which the complicated and novol provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1926, require amendment, if the operations of the Central Electricity Board are not to &quot;be unduly hampered.2. On one point an amendment of the law has becomeurgently necessary.     There are some Generating Stations which, although their efficiency and importance is not sufficiently great to warrant their permanent inclusion as &quot;selected stations&quot; in the national scheme, are for the time being producing electricity at a relatively low cost, and which therefore could not economically be closed down at present or in the immediate future.     It is Important, both in the interests of the national scheme and of the &apos;-   undertakers themselves, that undertakings of this kind should not be dissociated from the national scheme, and the Board have hitherto successfully overcome the difficulty by making spocial arrangements with the undertakers owning such stations for the control of the stations and the inter-change of supplies between the systems of such undertakers arid the National Grid.     Recently, however, some of these undertakers have been legally advised that suoh arrangements are ul;tra vires and two of such undertakers (Taunton Corporation and Torquay Corporation) are seeking powers,  in Bills which they are promoting this Session, to legalise such arrangements.     I am satisfied that such special-arrangements are necessary in certain oases to enable the Board to continue its operations successfully.     The Law Officersj however,
advise me that such arrangements are clearly ultra vires under the existing law.     In the circumstances, I ask for authority to announce forthwith that the Government will introduce general legislation validating existing or future arrangements of this kind.        This would enable me, I think,  to secure the withdrawal or the proposals in the two Private Bills referred to which,  if further proceeded with, might provoke controversy in Parliament.There is a second important point on which an amendment of the law might at any time become urgently necessary.      The Board&apos;s Tariffs, fixing the terms on which they are prepared to supply authorised undertakers, contain provisions to the effect that special prices may be quoted to enable authorised undertakers to negotiate prices with consumers for exceptional supplies in cases in which the Board are satisfied that special circumstances exist.     Without such a provision, it might of course be impossible to hold out sufficient inducement to make it worth while for large undertakings, such as a mine or railway,  to be electrified. Electricity supply undertakers are not In general precluded from quoting special charges in such circumstances but the Law Officers have advised that the Central Electricity Board have no such power and that the existing provisions in their Tariffs on the point are accordingly illegal.     I should propose, therefore, to include in the Bill provisions legalising the action of the Board in this respect.I thinh that it would be desirable, also to take the opportunity of this legislation to give effect to the recommendation contained in the Report of Lord Y/eir&apos;s Committee on Main Line Railway Electrification to the effect that the Board should be given power to afford direct supplies for railway electrification schemes.     At present, such supplies can only be given indirectly through authorised undertakers who are required to pass it on at cost price.      It v/ould assist railway electrification schemes if the railway companies could negotiate direct with the Central Electricity Board instead of having, as at present, to negotiate with the various authorised undertakers concerned.
Prom the point of view of the Grid Scheme some amendment of the law would he desirable to make provision for. the determination by a central authority of the value of the Board&apos;s undertaking as a whole and the apportionment of that value among the constituent parts.      Such amendment might also deal with the basis on which the value of the undertaking as a whole for rating purposes is to be ascertained having regard to the special financial provisions which govern the National Grid;      the valuation for rating purposes of selected stations; and the valuation of transformers and switch gear in Scotland. I propose te pursue these matters with the Minister of Health and the Secretary cf State for Scotland, but unless substantial agreement is found to exist among all those concerned as to what should be done, I will defer proposals for legislation until some more suitable opportunity.There is a number of other matters, for the most part cf a technical kind, where amendments cf the existing law would be desirable, but which cannot be regarded as urgently necessary. The Schedule to this Memorandum contains a list of such matters but I should not propose to include in the present Bill any of them which might unduly overload it or prove controversial^-I ask authority, therefore, to enable me to- announce that the Government will introduce legislation this Session to deal with the point referred to in paragraph 2 cf this Memorandum, and to include in the Bill provisions on the points referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 and in paragraph 1 of the Schedule.I should like also to be authorised to include in the Bill any of the ether points if they can be included without arousing controversy or if (contrary to my expectation) any of them become of immediate urgencyo14th February, 1934. (Sdc.-)   O.F.G.S.
SCHEDULE.An amendment of Section 12 of the Act of 1926 to enable the Electricity Commissioners in determining the prices to he charged for supplies of electricity passed on in hulk from one authorised undertaker to another, to pool the cost of tho whole or large part of tho transmission systems of certain power companies and to divide it hotween the various takers of the supply.A provision with this general object is included in the North Wales Electric Power Company^ Bill of the present Session.     Subject to certain amendments being made, the proposal is unobjectionable, but it would be better if it were to apply to all power companies. No opposition is anticipated.An amendment of Section 40 of the 1926 Act to make it clear that the additional payment, provided for in the Section, in respect of a discontinued generating station is not barred by the fact that when the under-taking is purchased by the local authority, the generating station may have been scrapped and be no longer in existence, or by the fact that the distribution system has been converted to standard frequency while the generating station has not.An amendment of Section 10 of the Act to make it cloar that the Board have unrestricted power to supply electricity directly to authorised undertakers who are the owners of a selected station situated within the area of supply of a power company or the district of a joint electricity authority.An amendment of Section 20 (3) (a) of the Act to empower the Board to supply directly at the Tariff fixed under Section 11 to the owner of a selected station not being an authorised undertaker all the electricity
- 2 -required by him for the purposes of his business or undertaking.Provisions giving statutory confirmation to the arrangements which have been made between the Board and the representatives of the supply industry concerning the incidence of cost of Switchgear consequent upon alterations resulting from connections to the Grid System.An amendment of Section 13 of the Act to provide that the protection afforded by that Section to the owners of existing selected stations shall apply to such owners oven when they are not authorised undertakers.A provision for spreading over a period of years compensation paid under Section 15 of the 1926 Act, due to the closing or restriction of output of generating stations.An addition to Section 15 of the 1926 Act, to provide that the compensation paid under the Act to employees due to the closing or restricted working of generating stations forms part of the cost of taking a &quot;Grid&quot; supply.
