MEMORANDUM ON DISARMAMENT.I.1. On the 22nd November the Bureau of the Disarmament Conference unanimously decided that the work of the conference should be suspended for a period, in order to permit of parallel and supplementary efforts being carried on between different States, mainly through the diplomatic channel. In the interval this method has been actively pursued, and bilateral communications have taken place between various capitals. As a result, the points of view of certain Governments have been further defined, and some general propositions which they had previously advanced have taken a more concrete shape. Yet it must be admitted that, on comparing the attitudes thus disclosed, no firm basis of agree-ment at present emerges; and, while these diplomatic exchanges have undoubtedly cleared the ground and revealed the immensity and difficulty of the problem in their true proportions, the method recently followed cannot in itself produce a unanimous result and is in danger of exhausting its usefulness. On the other hand, a resumption of the discussions at Geneva without any new directive suggestions is only too likely to lead to further disappointment.2. In these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom consider that the time has arrived when they should make plain their own attitude in the present situation, the gravity of which must be apparent to every thoughtful mind, and should thus make a further positive contribution, so far as lies in their power, to promote a reconciliation of views in a matter upon which the future of the world may depend. If agreement is to be reached and a Convention is to be signed, it is useless for any Power merely to insist on its own ideals and its own requirements or to refuse to depart in any degree from the solution which it deems best. His Majesty&apos;s Government are making the present communication, not for the purpose of formulating unattainable ideals, but in order to indicate the lines of a compromise which they believe, after reviewing the history of the discussions and closely studying the recent interchange of views, should be generally acceptable.3. Before dealing with any specific proposition as to the measure or the regulation of armaments, His Majesty&apos;s Government must reassert the main objective to which all proposals on this subject are directed. That objective is, as article jB of the Covenant declares, the maintop a/nce of peace. Even though increase of armed strength may be actuated by reasons of defence, it is an index of fear of attack from another quarter, and a measure of the alarm and disquiet existing between peoples. Conversely, a general agreement securing the limita-tion of armaments at the lowest practicable level would be the most effective and significant proof of international appeasement and an encouragement of the mutual confidence which springs from good and neighbourly relations. Consequently, His Majesty&apos;s Government regard agreement about armaments not as an end in itself, but rather as a concomitant of world peace and as an outcome of political amelioration. Eor this reason, they have always acknowledged the relation between the conception of equality of rights on the one hand, and of security on the other. For this same reason, they welcome the indications that Herr Hitler&apos;s recent proposals, whatever may be said of their precise content, are concerned not only with technical questions of armament, but with political guarantees against aggression.4. It follows from the above considerations that agreement is most likely to&apos; be reached on a broad basis which combines regulation of armaments with assurances in the political field. Protracted debates on disarmament in its-limited and purely technical aspect can lead to no conclusion, unless wider7211   [9538] b
considerations touching the equality and the security of nations are borne in mind and provided for. Hence the United Kingdom Draft Convention, which was approved at Geneva as a basis of the ultimate agreement by a unanimous vote which included both France and Germany, began with a &quot; Part I &quot; on the subject of Security, proposing methods of consultation for the purpose of determining on appropriate action in the event of a threatened breach of the Briand-Kellogg Pact. The amplification of this proposal is dealt with below (paragraph 9). His Majesty&apos;s Government must emphasise that they have never departed from the principles and purposes of the Draft Convention or have sought to substitute a second and contradictory draft for it. If there were any misapprehension in any quarter on this score, the declaration they are now making will finally remove it. The Prime Minister, when presenting the Draft Convention to the Conference in March of last year, plainly intimated that it was not necessarily to be regarded as a final and unalterable text, and subsequent discussion has shown that it requires adjustment in certain respects if general agreement is to be reached. Any suggestions which have since been put forward for consideration have been tentatively advanced with a view to seeing whether they would promote such agreement, and for no other purpose. But the underlying conceptions of the Draft Convention remain the standpoint of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and could only be abandoned if and when a more acceptable alternative were generally agreed.5. But while His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to depart from the lines of the Draft Convention without being assured that there is an alternative which would more readily lead to universal agreement, they have been perfectly prepared to give unprejudiced consideration to new suggestions and to do their utmost to promote their general acceptance. The failure to reach agreement would inflict a fearful blow upon the hopes of all friends of peace throughout the world, whereas the attainment of agreement would create and build up that confidence which is the only secure basis for the limitation of armaments. The importance, therefore, of attaining international agreement by any possible means is so great that no suggestions, from whatever quarter they come, should be rejected merely because of a preference for a better solution which is, in fact, unattainable. An illustration lies ready to hand. It is some-times urged that the solution of the disarmament problem lies in the immediate abandonment by all the world of all the weapons which the Peace Treaties, withheld from certain Powers. But it is manifest that such a solution is in practice unattainable at the present time. - That is no reason for abandoning the effort to secure, in this first Convention, all that can be attained. The devotion of the whole British people to the cause of disarmament is deep and sincere, as is sufficiently proved by the present position of its armaments in comparison with those of other leading Powers. They realise that further progress can only be achieved by agreement, and. therefore His Majesty&apos;s Government would still work for agreement, even though, having regard to the principle of equality of rights, agreement is found to involve alongside of disarmament in some quarters some measure of re-armament in others.6. It should not be overlooked that the scheme of the Draft Convention itself involves some degree of rearmament for those States whose armaments are at present restricted by treaty. Germany, for example, in view of the numerical increase proposed in her effectives, would need larger quantities of such weapons as she is already entitled to possess. And this is not all. His Majesty&apos;s Government have more than once publicly stated that an international agreement based on the admitted principle of equality of rights in a regime of security necessarily involves that, within the stages provided for by such an agreement, the situation must be reached in which arms of a kind permitted to one State cannot continue to be denied to another. His Majesty&apos;s. Government see no escape from this conclusion, and they do not seek to escape from it, for they are convinced that the best prospect for the future peace of the world would be afforded by an agreement which recognises and provides for this parity of treatment, while it abolishes or reduces to the lowest, possible level all arms of a specially offensive character, and provides by the most appropriate means available for a greater sense of security. So far as Europe is concerned; a. reconciliation of the points of view of France and Germany is the essential
condition of general agreement. If a way is not found to accommodate their respective points of view, this greater sense of security will not be promoted. And without it, substantial disarmament is impossible. On the other hand, if an agreement is reached, even if the agreement at present attainable falls short of the highest hopes, the gain of reaching and observing such an agreement would be immeasurable, and the fact that it had been reached and observed would form the firm foundation on which a further agreement of more comprehensive character might be based in the future.7. We must therefore seek a solution where a solution can be found. No agreement is no solution at all, and the world will be thrown back upon unrestricted competition in the supply and manufacture of weapons of destruc-tion, the end of which no man can see. Putting aside, therefore, as not immediately attainable the ideal of universal disarmament to Germany&apos;s permitted level, and refusing to acquiesce in the conclusion that agreement cannot be reached, the choice appears to His Majesty&apos;s G-overnment to lie between two conceivable courses so far as the future armaments of the heavily armed Powers are concerned.  These two choices are : (1) To reach agreement in a Convention which will involve the abandonment of certain classes of weapons by the most heavily armed Powers.(2) To reach agreement on the basis that the most heavily armed Powers are unable or unwilling to disarm, but that they will undertake not to increase their present armaments.The second course is the one which is indicated in certain quarters as the most that can be hoped for. But His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot contemplate as acceptable a conclusion which, though it would provide for a limitation of armaments, would do nothing whatever to secure their reduction. His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, would earnestly press upon other Governments that the first course, which they most strongly prefer and regard as more in accord with the main object to be attained, should not be abandoned, but should be actively pursued. The second part of this memorandum sets out the way in which His Majesty ^Government believe this could be accomplished.II.8. His Majesty&apos;s Government conceive that international agreement in the matter of armaments can only be reached by making adequate provision under the three heads of (a) security, (b) equality of rights, (c) dis-armament. These three topics were all dealt with in the Draft Convention, and the object of the present document is to explain how, in the light of actual circumstances and of the claims and proposals put forward from various quarters, the contents of that Draft Convention might be modified or expanded in certain particulars with a view to securing general agreement. His Majesty&apos;s Government have studied with close attention the points of view advanced by the French, Italian, German and other Govern-ments in the course of recent interchanges. Nearly a year ago His Majesty&apos;s Government undertook the responsibility of placing before the General Commission a full Draft Convention. The adjustments now proposed in the text of that Draft are such as subsequent communication and consideration show to be best calculated to bring about concrete results.9. Security.-Part I of the Draft Convention dealt with the subject of security. As the result of a redraft which was unanimously approved on the 24th May, 1933, it now consists of four articles, three of which provide in effect that, in the event of a breach or threat of breach of the Pact of Paris, immediate consultation may be called for and shall take place between signatories to the Convention for the purpose of preserving the peace, of using good offices for the restoration of peace, and, in the event that it proves impossible thus to restore the peace, to determine which party or parties to the dispute should be held responsible. It will be observed therefore that, as at present drafted, the event which brings these provisions into play is the breach or threatened breach of the Pact of Paris. His Majesty&apos;s Government regard such provisions as of very great importance. But so vital is the connexion of a feeling of security with the peace of the world that they wOuld add to them yet further articles.[9538] b 2
It is in their view important to extend the principle of consultation in the event of a. breach or threat of breach of the Pact of Paris to the event of a breach or threat of breach of the Disarmament Convention itself. They would therefore suggest that three new articles 2 (a), 2 (6) and 2 (c) should be inserted between the revised articles 2 and 3. The first of these 2 (a) would be article 89 of the present Draft Convention, which declares that the loyal execution of the Convention is a matter of common interest to the High Contracting Parties. Article 2 (b) would declare: &quot; The provisions for immediate consultation contained in article 1 will also be applicable in the event of the Permanent Disarmament Commission, to be set up in accordance with Part V, Section I, of the present Convention, reporting the existence of facts which show that any High Contracting Party has failed to execute loyally the present Convention.&quot; Article 2 (c) would state : &quot;It shall be the object of such consultation to exchange views as to the steps to be taken for the purpose of restoring the situation and of maintaining in operation the provisions of the present Convention.&quot; The insertion of these articles would, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, emphasise the inescapable duty of all signatories of the Convention to keep in the closest touch with one another, and to do whatever is right and possible to prevent or remedy any violation of so important an international treaty.A further contribution to the cause of peace and security, by lessening any tension or anxiety which exists between Germany and surrounding States, is provided by the willingness of the German Chancellor to conclude pacts of non-aggression with all Germany&apos;s neighbours. Such pacts should in no way weaken, but, on the contrary, should expressly reaffirm existing obligations to maintain peace under such instruments as the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Pact of Paris and the Treaties of Locarno, and His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot doubt that if such pacts were expressly entered into in connexion with the Convention (which, like the pacts themselves, His Majesty&apos;s Government, for reasons stated below, consider might be made in the first instance for a period of ten years) their practical value for the purpose of creating a sense of security will not be disputed.His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the suggestions here collected under the head of security constitute a sum total worthy of general acceptance. They have a right to expect that, if these provisions and pledges were solemnly entered into, they would not be lightly violated, and that any violation of them would be met in the most practical and effective way by immediately assembling Govern-ments and States in support of international peace and agreement against the disturber and the violator.10. Equality of Rights.- The Five-Power Declaration of the 11th December, 1932, put on record, in connexion with the problem of disarmament, the principle &quot;of equality of rights in a system which would provide security for all nations &quot; and declared that this principle should find itself embodied in a Disarmament Convention effecting a substantial reduction and limitation of armaments. From this Declaration His Majesty&apos;s Government have never withdrawn and they now reaffirm their unqualified adherence to it. The previous paragraph of this Memorandum attempts to define the essential elements of security without which the necessary conditions for an adequate Disarmament Convention would not be fulfilled. But His Majesty&apos;s Government do not hesitate to declare that the principle of equality of rights is no less essential in the matter of armaments than the principle of security both must have their practical application if international agreement about armaments is to be reached. The proposals which follow, no less than the Draft Convention itself, are conceived in that spirit, and constitute a practical fulfilment of that principle.11. Disarmament. His Majesty&apos;s Government are glad to understand that Chancellor Hitler has declared that Germany voluntarily renounces any claim to possess &apos;&apos; offensive &apos;&apos; weapons and limits herself to normal &apos;&apos; defensive &apos;&apos; armaments required for the army with which she would be provided in the Convention. The German Chancellor, moreover, advances this proposition on the assumption that the heavily-armed States are not prepared to abandon under the Convention any portion of their existing weapons. As already indicated in paragraph 7 of this Memorandum, His Majesty&apos;s Government are entirely unwilling to accept this last assumption, and must insist that the only agreement worthy of the name of a Disarmament Convention will be one which contains reduction as well as limitation of armaments.   There is, moreover, a
further reason why His Majesty&apos;s Government emphasise the fact that the German Chancellor&apos;s declaration renouncing offensive armaments and claiming only what is necessary for normal defence, is based upon the assumption that the heavily-armed Powers are not prepared to reduce their own armaments in any degree. The measure of Germany&apos;s needs will necessarily be reduced- if this assumption proves incorrect. A positive contribution to disarmament by the heavily-armed Powers will therefore help to bring the scale down all round, and should, as His Majesty&apos;s Government conceive, reduce the demands which Germany might otherwise be disposed to put forward.12. The following proposals, in modification of the Draft Convention, are put forward on the assumption that the agreement would last for ten years. They have been framed after giving the fullest and most anxious consideration to suggestions and criticisms from all other quarters, and represent, in the judgment of His Majesty&apos;s Government, what might well be agreed in existing circumstances.13. (a) Effectives. While His Majesty&apos;s Government are still in favour, so far as they are concerned, of the figures given in the table they submitted at the end of article 13 of the Draft Convention, they are aware of the recent discussion with the German Government in regard to the proper number of average daily effectives which should be allotted to Germany. To the figure of 200,000 on a basis of 8 months&apos; service proposed in the Draft Convention, the German Government have suggested the alternative of 300,000 on a basis of 12 months&apos; service. This is one of the outstanding points of difference emerging from the recent exchange of views through the diplomatic channel. Though the point is difficult and serious, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not think this divergence ought to raise any insuperable obstacle to an agreed compromise. In the Draft Convention they themselves proposed 200,000 as the figure for the average daily effectives stationed in the home country for France, Germany, Italy and Poland. It is not the figure of 200,000 which in their mind is the essential and unalterable element, but the principle of parity, fairly calculated and applied, in these effectives between the four countries. They are aware that difficult calculations are necessary to establish the right figures for the ten years which, as above suggested, would be the life of the Disarmament Convention, but His Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that the fixing of the proper figure cannot be beyond the power of adjustment between the States principally concerned if the problem was made the subject of frank and conciliatory discussion between them. If the figure of 200,000 was found to be too low, an accommodation could surety be found between this figure (which His Majesty&apos;s Government believe to be preferred by the majority of the Powers concerned) and 300,000.Agreement as to this figure will enable all European continental armies to be reduced to a standard type composed of short-term effectives as proposed in the Draft Convention. His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest that this process should be completed in, at most, four years. In article 16 of the Draft Convention, eight months was suggested as the maximum total period of service for these effectives, though, at the same time, it was recognised that in special cases the period might have to be twelve months. His Majesty&apos;s Government appreciate that this must necessarily be a matter for the continental Governments to determine, and they are ready to concur in the longer period if such is the general desire.In regard to land armed forces stationed overseas, His.Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have no further reductions to propose in addition to those already inserted in the Draft Convention. These, it will be remembered, would entail a considerable reduction of French overseas forces.A difficult problem has been raised in regard to the so-called &quot; para-military training,&quot; i.e., the military training outside the army of men of military age. His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest that such training outside the army should be prohibited, this prohibition being checked by a system of permanent and automatic supervision, in which the supervising organisation should be guided less by a strict definition of the term &quot;military training&quot; than by the military knowledge and experience of its experts. They are particularly glad to be informed that the German Government have freely promised to provide proof, through the medium of control, that the SA. and the S.S. are not of a military
character, and have added that similar proof will be furnished in respect of the Labour Corps. It is essential to a settlement that any doubts and suspicions-in regard to these matters should be set and kept at rest.14. (b) Land War Material. Certain countries will require, for the increased numbers of their standardised armies, an increased number of such weapons as are at present possessed by their smaller long-service armies. His Majesty&apos;s Government accept this view. They would emphasise that, under the Convention, prohibition as to the possession of anti-aircraft guns would disappear. They would suggest that the maximum calibre of guns in permanent frontier and fortress defensive systems should be fixed by international agreement.Of the types of land war material at present denied by treaty to certain Powers, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider two weapons in particular must be dealt with. His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed in their Draft Convention that the maximum limit for the weight of tanks should be 16 tons. They recognised, however, that this problem &quot; evidently requires further international examination.&quot; They are most anxious, in the interests alike of disarmament and of the realisation of the equality of all countries, that progress should at once be made with the elimination of tanks above the 16-ton limit. They suggest, therefore, that tanks over 30 tons should be destroyed by the end of the first year, over 20 tons by the end of the third year and over 16 tons by the end of the fifth year. These practical steps should help towards the solution of the problem, but &quot; further international examination,&quot; as contemplated by Article 21 of the Draft Convention, is obviously necessary. His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that this examination should be held by the Permanent Disarmament Commission, and should be completed not later than by the end of the third year. His Majesty&apos;s Government understand that the German Govern-ment maintain that tanks up to 6 tons are, in their view, necessary for the defence of their country. This view of the German Government was based on the supposition that other countries would make no reduction in respect of tanks at all, whereas His Majesty&apos;s Government now propose the reductions set forth above. None the less, His Majesty&apos;s Government are, for their part, willing to agree that the new German short-term service army, contemplated by the Draft Convention, should be equipped with tanks up to 6 tons. His Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to agree to a similar arrangement in respect of Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria.As regards mobile land guns, it will be recalled that in the Draft Convention His Majesty&apos;s Government made the proposal to secure that the maximum limit of these&apos; guns for the future should be 115 mm. They would greatly regret any proposals which tend to increase the size of future construction beyond this calibre, but they are bound to face the fact that the German Government maintain the view that mobile land guns up to 155 mm. are necessary as part of the armament of the proposed new short-term service army. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, though still preferring the more drastic proposals of their Draft Conven-tion, are willing to acquiesce in this proposal as part of the Convention, if by so doing they can secure prompt and general agreement on all points. His. Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to agree to similar proposals in respect of Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria.But there remains the question whether it is not possible, by means of the proposed convention, to secure the reduction in the maximum calibre of mobile land&apos; guns possessed by any Power. His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that such guns over 350 mm. should be destroyed by the end of the first year, those-over 220 mm. by the end of the fourth year and those over 155 mm. by the end of the seventh year.15. (c) Air Arm.aments.-His Majesty&apos;s Government have repeatedly emphasised the great importance of agreement in regard to the limitation and reduction of air armaments which may, in the future, prove the most potent military weapons in the possession of mankind. Full reflection has convinced them of the justice of the proposals contained in articles 34-41 of their Draft Convention. Article 35 requires that the Permanent Disarmament Commission shall, immediately, devote itself to the working out of the best possible schemes providing for the complete abolition of military and naval aircraft, which must
character and have added,that similar proof will be furnished in respect of the Labour Corps. It is essential to a settlement that any doubts and suspicions, in regard to these matters should be set and kept at rest.14. (b) Land War Material. Certain countries will require, for the increased numbers of their standardised armies, an increased number of such weapons as are at present possessed by their smaller long-service armies. His Majesty5s Government accept this view. They would emphasise that, under the Convention, prohibition as to the possession of anti-aircraft guns would disappear. They would suggest that the maximum calibre of guns in permanent frontier and fortress defensive systems should be fixed by international agreement.Of the types of land war material at present denied by treaty to certain Powers, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider two weapons in particular must be dealt with.

(c) Air Armaments. His Majesty&apos;s Government have repeatedly emphasised the great importance of agreement in regard to the limitation and reduction of air armaments which may, in the future, prove the most potent military weapons in the possession of mankind. Full reflection has convinced them of the justice of the proposals contained in articles 34-41 of their Draft Convention. Article 35 requires that the Permanent Disarmament Commission shall, immediately, devote itself to the working out of the best possible schemes, providing for the complete abolition of military and naval aircraft, which must
be dependent on the effective supervision of civil aviation to prevent its misuse for military purposes. His Majesty&apos;s Government are aware that the German Delegation at Geneva moved an amendment to this article, proposing the total abolition of military and naval aircraft without, however, making any specific provision for solving the problem of civil aviation. The appropriate occasion to discuss this proposal would be the immediate enquiry provided for in article 35. In their view it would be prejudicial to the prospects of the enquiry that any party not hitherto entitled to possess military aircraft should claim such possession pending the results of the enquiry. At the same time they frankly recognise that Germany and other States not at present entitled to military air-craft could not be asked to postpone for long their claim. They suggest, there-fore, that the maintenance of the status quo laid down in article 36 of their Draft Convention should be modified as follows : If the Permanent Disarmament Commission has not decided on abolition at the end of two years, all countries shall be entitled to possess military aircraft. Countries would reduce or increase by stages, as the case might be, in the following eight years so as to attain, by the end of the Convention, the figures in the table annexed to article 41, or some Other figures to be agreed on. Germany would acquire parity with the principal air Powers by these stages, and corresponding provisions would be made for other Powers not at present entitled to possess military or naval aircraft.16. It is, of course, understood that all construction or fresh acquisition of weapons of the kinds which are to be destroyed during the life of the Convention would be prohibited.17. (d) Naval Armaments. His Majesty&apos;s Government, for their part, still stand by the Naval Chapter of the Draft Convention. They appreciate, however, that the time which has passed since they put forward that Draft Convention last March has brought much closer the assembling of the Naval Conference of 1935. Should it be thought, in view of this consideration, that the situation prior to the 1935 Conference could appropriately be dealt with by some simpler arrangement than that contained in the Naval Chapter, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to make proposals to that end in due course. They suggest, however, that prompt agreement on other matters, and embodiment of that agreement in a world-wide convention, would be of great assistance to the naval discussions proposed in article 33 of the Draft Convention.18. Supervision. His Majesty&apos;s Government are well aware of the great importance attached by various Governments to the institution of a system of permanent and automatic supervision to control the observance of the Disarmament Convention. There is obviously a close connection between mutual agreement about levels of armament and a system of adequate international supervision. There are, however, many technical difficulties which arise in this connection and which must be practically met. His Majesty&apos;s Government affirm their willingness, if general agreement is reached on all other issues, to agree to the application of a system of permanent and automatic supervision, to come into force with the obligations of the Convention.19. It will be seen that the adjustments which His Majesty&apos;s Government propose are based on a duration of ten years for the Convention. The Draft Convention suggested five years. Continued reflection, however, on the subject and constant discussion with other Governments have convinced His Majesty&apos;s Government that any stable system should be founded on a longer period. Only if a longer view is taken can substantial reductions of armaments, and the full realisation of all countries&apos; equality of rights and durable security, be realised. The proposal of the German Chancellor, that undertakings not to resort to force between Germany and other European Powers should be of at least ten years&apos; duration, fits in very closely with the proposal now made by His Majesty&apos;s Government that the Disarmament Convention itself should be of ten years&apos; duration. They confidently hope that, if a Convention on the lines now proposed can be accepted, humanity will within the coining ten years acquire such a deep-rooted conviction of the contribution to peace which such a convention can make that, when the Convention is due to expire, further progress can be achieved in the reduction of armaments. By the successful conclusion of a Convention on such lines, and in the atmosphere of firmer peace and increased
mutual confidence which would accompany it, the way will be prepared for a closer and more hopeful approach to the political and economic problems which at present perplex and divide the nations of the world.20. The object of His Majesty&apos;s Government in formulating these proposals and presenting them for consideration is not to describe the terms of an agree-ment which they themselves would most desire, without regard to the claims or needs of others, but to propound a basis of compromise on which it would appear, in present circumstances, that general agreement could and should now be reached. The proposals, therefore, must be considered as a whole and they are framed in the endeavour fairly to meet essential claims on all sides. The grave consequences which would follow the failure of the Disarmament Conference are realised by all and need no further emphasis. The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the international sphere is directed, first and foremost, to contributing to the utmost of their power to the avoidance of these consequences by promoting general agreement. If agreement is secured and the return of Germany to Geneva and to the League of Nations brought about (and this ought to be an essential condition of agreement), the signature of the Convention would open a new prospect of international co-operation and lay a new foundation for international order.January 29, 1934.o
