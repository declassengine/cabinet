January 1934.SECEET.Copy No.51CP. 1 (34).CABINET.COMMITTEE ON FINAL REPORT OF ROYAL COMMISSION ONLOTTERIES AND BETTING.1. AT their meeting on the 19th July, 1933 (Cabinet 47 (33)), the Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Home Secretary (Paper CP. 179 (33)) covering the Final Report of the Royal Commission on Lotteries and Betting, and agreed that a Cabinet Committee composed as follows The Home Secretary (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for Air.The Secretary of State for Scotland,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Minister of Transport,The Attorney-General,The Lord Advocate, andThe Financial Secretary to the Treasury,should be set up to study the Report with a view to submitting recommendations to the Cabinet in the autumn.We have held twelve meetings at which we have given careful consideration to a series of memoranda prepared by the Home Office, in consultation with the Scottish Office, summarising the recommendations of the Royal Commission, and we now submit the following report.2. We think that there will be general agreement with the conclusion of the Commission that the law on the matters referred to it for inquiry stands in need of revision in the light of present-day conditions.We are in general agreement with the principles which the Royal Commission suggest should govern legislative policy in the field of betting and gambling, namely: (a) that the State should not interfere with private gambling between individuals, and is concerned only with the organised exploitation (often for private gain) of the gambling propensity; and(b) that the object of the State in dealing with facilities for organised orprofessional betting or gambling should be to place restrictions upon such facilities, and such facilities only, as can be shown to have serious social consequences if not checked.3. The two matters on which the Government are being pressed to reach an early decision are the regulation of betting on greyhound tracks (and in particular the question whether the use of the totalisator should be allowed on those tracks) and the measures to be taken to deal with the sale in this country of tickets in large-scale lotteries, and particularly in the Irish sweepstakes.On the other hand, there is a close connection between the various forms of betting, on-the-course and off-the-course, and from the point of view of police administration there is a strong case for taking early action to deal with theReport.
difficult problem of street betting. Again, the question of lotteries is intimately connected with that of competitions of mixed skill and chance, such as are promoted in certain newspapers. These considerations point to the desirability of dealing with the whole subject of lotteries, betting, and gaming in a compre-hensive fashion. At the same time, we realise that a measure covering the whole field would be a major and complicated piece of controversial legislation and might occupy a considerable amount of parliamentary time..It is for the Cabinet to decide whether the promised legislation should deal with these matters on a comprehensive basis, or whether it should be confined to a smaller measure dealing only with the more urgent issues, even at the risk of some difficulties which may arise from the limited scope of the legislation. Should the Cabinet decide to limit the scope of the Bill, the most convenient arrangement would be to confine it to lotteries (including competitions), betting on the course (including the regulation of totalisator betting), and certain amend-ments of the Racecourse Betting Act, 1928, relating to the operations of the Racecourse Betting Control Board.4. Our report deals with all major questions raised in the Royal Commission^ recommendations. For the convenience of the Cabinet, we have grouped our recommendations under the headings of (a) on-the-course betting, (b) off-the-course betting, and (c) lotteries and competitions; and our detailed proposals are summarised in the respective appendices attached to this report. In what follows, we propose to refer only to the salient features of those proposals and to points of substance Avhere we propose a departure from the recom-mendations of the Royal Commission.We have not formulated detailed recommendations regarding the operations of the Racecourse Betting Control Board, but we outline our views as to the policy which should be pursued in paragraph 23 of this report.The amendments in the law recommended by the Royal Commission in regard to gaming are of minor importance, and, in our judgment, a Cabinet decision regarding them is not required.(A) On-the-Course Betting.5. The undesirable social consequences arising from unregulated betting at greyhound tracks which have sprung up all over the country, have made it necessary to devise measures for the regulation of betting on the course.Limitation of Betting Days.6. The Commission recommended that the number of days on which betting-facilities may be provided at any course, should be limited by statute to not more than 10 days in any calendar month and 100 days in any calendar year. In order to prevent neighbouring tracks so arranging their 100 days as to provide facilities for continuous gambling in an area, the Commission further recommended that County Councils and the Councils of County Boroughs should be required to fix two week-days on which betting facilities may normally be provided at courses in their area which were licensed for betting.7. We recommend the adoption of the principles (a) that there should be a statutory limitation of the number of days in any calendar year on which betting-facilities may be provided at any course, and (b) that in order to avoid the provision of continuous gambling facilities, the days on which betting facilities may be provided should be the same in any given area. We consider, however, that local authorities should be given a complete discretion as to the distribution of betting days throughout the year, and that no attempt should be made to fetter their discretion. At the same time, we think that, in order to allow local authorities, if they so desire, to allot the prescribed statutory maximum uniformly throughout the year by prescribing two week-days, it is desirable that the annual maximum should be 104 days, instead of 100 days as recommended by the Royal Commission.These recommendations will in practice affect only greyhound tracks. The number of days in any year on which horse-racing takes place at any course is far below the maximum proposed, and the restriction of betting to certain days specified by the local authority will not apply to horse racecourses.
Local Control over use of Places for Betting.8. We recommend the adoption of a system under which the management of any course which wishes betting facilities to be allowed there, would be required to obtain a licence from the County Council or Council of the County Borough, as the case may be. This would not apply to horse racecourses approved by the Racecourse Betting Control Board, or to courses used occasionally only (i.e., not more than eight days in the year).We consider that the grounds on which a licence may be refused by the local authority should be more narrowly defined than was proposed by the Royal Commission, and in Appendix I are set out the only grounds on which a local authority should, in our view, be empoAvered to refuse a licence.9. We further consider that a moratorium of five years should be granted to existing tracks in view of the outlay involved in the erection of the track, and the hardship Avhich would be involved by the immediate closing of any of these tracks. When a Private Member&apos;s Bill, which proposed a measure of local control over the erection of greyhound tracks was before a Standing Committee of the House of Commons last Session, the Committee agreed that existing tracks should be exempted for five years from the requirement to secure a licence.Types of Betting Facilities to be Allowed.10. The Royal Commission recommended as general principles that the management of a course should not be allowed to provide betting facilities, and should have no direct financial interest in the betting on the course.We do not think that it is practicable to apply these principles with too great rigidity, but where we have departed from them we have suggested such, safe-guards as we consider to be reasonably necessary.Bookmakers.11.   We recommend the adoption of the Commission^ proposals, namely : That a bookmaker registered in the manner described below should be allowed to stand at a fixed place on a course with such portable equipment as he may require.This proposal regularises the present position, while sweeping away certain subtle and artificial questions which arise through the application of the Betting Act, 1853, to the bookmaker^ operations on racecourses.Totalisator. .12. For reasons elaborated in its Interim Report the Commission recommended that the use of the totalisator elsewhere than on approved horse racecourses should be prohibited. In the view of the Commission, the use of totalisators on greyhound tracks, if it were to be allowed, could only be allowed under the strict and detailed control of a Government Department or a statutory board, but the Commission saw no reason in the public interest why a Board should be set up for this purpose. In its Final Report the Commission reiterated the view that there was no justification for the establishment of a statutory board to control betting on greyhound tracks.On the other hand, we were impressed by the force of the contention (though it does not appear to have appealed to the Commission) that, if betting at greyhound tracks is to be allowed, the backer should not be deprived of the fairer method of betting provided by the totalisator, especially as the totalisator is allowed on horse racecourses. Further, we believe that the undesirable develop-ments with which the totalisator at greyhound tracks has in the past been associated can be checked by the general restrictions which we have recommended for the control of on-the-course betting and by special restrictions oh the use of the totalisator.13. After carefully weighing the arguments on both sides, we have reached the conclusion that the use of the totalisator at greyhound tracks should be allowed, and we have set out in Appendix I our proposals for regulating the use of the totalisator. The principles by which we have been guided in drafting our proposals are (a) that the element of private profit should, so far as possible, be
eliminated, and (&amp;) that any question of State responsibility for the conduct of the totalisators, through the exercise of supervision by a statutory board or by a Government Department, should be avoided.14.   The main features of the scheme which we propose are as follows :  (a) the management of a greyhound track which has obtained a licence for betting from the local authority or any person authorised by them, should be allowed on the prescribed days to operate a totalisator, provided that it is mechanical and is of a type which conforms with Regulations to be made by the Secretary of State;(6) the operators of the totalisator should be allowed to retain not more than 3 per cent. fi*om the amounts staked with the totalisator. Although we are unable to obtain any precise information, we believe that a 3 per cent, deduction from pools would in the average case cover approximately the charges which have to be met by the operators. We do not, however, consider that the Government are called on to guarantee to the operators a sum which they will in all circumstances regard as adequate. The totalisator will be an added facility on a course, and if the deduction from pools does not recoup the operators for their charges, they may properly be expected to recover any deficit from the admission charges;(c) the operators of a totalisator should be required to produce annually to the local authority a certificate in a prescribed form from an accountant belonging to a recognised society that the accounts of totalisator operation are in order and that the totalisator has been conducted in a proper manner.15. We recommend that the right to operate a totalisator under these conditions should be confined to greyhound tracks, and that this should be made clear beyond all question in the proposed legislation. The practical question at the moment is whether the totalisator should be allowed on greyhound tracks; and we consider that the claim of any other sport in the future to be given this facility should be dealt with on its merits if and when the claim is made.(B) Off-the-Course Betting.The Problem of Street Betting.16. The Commission pointed out that the subject of off-the-course betting was dominated by the problem of street betting. After considering various proposals the Commission came to the conclusion that the only practicable way to tackle the problem of street betting was to provide some alternative facility. The Commission were opposed to the legalisation of cash betting offices, but proposed that cash postal betting (which is at present illegal) should be made legal; and a majority of the Commission recommended further that a bookmaker should be allowed to receive bets deposited at his office in a special box provided that the backers did not enter the office or come into contact with the bookmaker or his employees.17. We have found it impossible to form a close estimate of the extent to which cash postal betting would replace street betting and other similar forms of betting. We believe that bookmakers would probably find it to their advantage to transfer their street business and a considerable proportion of their credit business to a cash postal basis, in the one case because of the heavy costs and in the other because of the bad debts incurred. The uncertain factor is whether backers could be induced to alter their present habits of betting in public places and in factories and workshops.18. We believe that cash postal betting would at least go some way to replace street betting. Its legalisation would also remove the reproach that the present law, which allows credit betting in certain circumstances, but not cash betting in similar circumstances, represents &quot;class legislation.&quot; We accordingly propose the legalisation of cash postal betting without &apos;&apos; resorting.19. We do not recommend the adoption of the proposal made by a majority of the Commission that a bookmaker should be allowed to receive bets deposited
in a special letter box at his office by a backer. Police officers who have been consulted have pointed out grave practical difficulties in the way of giving effect to this proposal. Further, the policy of the existing law is to discountenance the establishment of betting offices to which persons resort for the purpose of betting, whether on a cash or a credit basis; and to legalise deposit boxes would seriously undermine this principle of the existing law.Registration of Bookmakers..20. As an integral part of our proposals to regulate off-the-course betting, we recommend the adoption of a system of registration of bookmakers, though without certain features of the Commission^ proposals which appeared to us to suggest a guarantee by the authorities of the bookmakers honesty. Our detailed proposals under this head will be found in Appendix II. We believe that regis-tration would prove of considerable value in the enforcement of the law relating to off-the-course betting.Other Measures.21. We recommend the adoption of the proposal made by the majority of the Commission that a bookmaker should be allowed to conduct football combina-tion betting at fixed odds for ready money or on credit. Ready money football coupon betting (besides entailing in many cases a contravention of the Betting Act 1853) is at present subject to special prohibition under the Ready Money Football Betting Act, 1920, a measure sponsored by the Football Association. If cash postal betting is to be legalised in the case of horse racing, dog racing and other sports, it seems to be very difficult, as the majority of the Commission point out, to maintain a discrimination against ready money betting in the case of football alone.22.   We also recommend, as proposed by the Commission (a) that a bookmaker should not be allowed to conduct betting on thetotalisator or pool principle. This form of betting requires some kind of supervision, and the Government does not seem called upon to furnish supervision to a bookmaker conducting betting from an office;(b) that it should be an offence for a bookmaker knowingly to have a bettingtransaction with a person under 17 years of age;(c) that it should be an offence to employ a person under 17 in the conductof a betting business or as a messenger conveying betting slips.Racecourse Betting Control Board.23. The Royal Commission took the view that there could be no question of reversing the decision of Parliament, made as lately as 1928, to establish the Racecourse Betting Control Board and to allow it to conduct totalisator betting on cash terms at horse racecourses with persons attending these courses.Of the activities of the Board which do not clearly fall within these limits, only one matter calls for a Cabinet decision. Under present arrangements the Board pays commission, out of the deduction from the sums staked with the Board&apos;s totalisators, to a private company (Tote Investors^ Ltd.), which collects credit bets from its clients and translates them into cash bets staked with the Board&apos;s totalisator on the racecourse. The legality of these commissions is at present being tested in a case pending before the High Court.The Royal Commission took the view that there was objection on grounds of principle to a system under which the Board expended money staked with the totalisator for the purpose of attracting off-the-course bets to the totalisators.In considering this question, it must be borne in mind that the Board has incurred a considerable capital liability in the conduct of its business, and that, if the source of revenue at present available to the Board through the operations of Tote Investors, Ltd., is cut off, there will be a serious risk of the Board becoming insolvent. If this were to happen, responsibility for it would be regarded as falling on the Government, and there would be little prospect of any money ever being available for the purposes specified in the Act which set up the Board.We are not in a position to make any specific recommendations to the Cabinet on this subject, since, had &quot;we entered into discussions with the Board and Tote
Investors, Ltd., we might have prejudiced the general question of policy. The general feeling of the Committee, however, is that, in order to keep the Racecourse Betting Control Board solvent, it should be lawful for the Board to obtain money brought to the totalisator from off the course either by arrangements such as those now made with Tote Investors, Ltd., or by some other, and perhaps more satisfactory, means.Betting Inducements.24. The Royal Commission took the view that the State should adopt a more restrictive attitude in dealing with inducements to betting than in dealing with organised betting facilities, since the object of such inducements is not to meet an existing demand for betting facilities, but to increase the demand.25. We recommend that advertisements by bookmakers should be drastically restricted, and that the activities of the professional tipster should be prohibited, but we do not recommend that there should be any interference with the publication of racing information in the newspapers.(C) Lotteries and Competitions.Promotion in this Country of Large Lotteries.26. The Royal Commission came to the conclusion that large-scale lotteries, whether promoted by the State for the direct benefit of the Exchequer, or by a statutory board for charitable objects, or by individual charities, were socially undesirable and should not be allowed.We believe that large-scale lotteries are not desired by the country at large and we recommend that they should not be legalised.Sale of Tickets in Foreign Lotteries.27. The Royal Commission point out that, whatever be the policy in regard to the promotion of large lotteries in this country, the sale here of tickets in lotteries promoted abroad must remain prohibited; and the Commission make detailed proposals for rendering more effective the prohibition of the sale of foreign lottery tickets in this country.28. The principal proposals of the Commission, which we recommend should be adopted in the form set out in Appendix III, are as follows : (i) That the publication in newspapers of information about lotteries(particularly the publication of results of draws) should be prohibited. Undoubtedly a considerable factor in the popularity of the Irish sweepstakes has been the publicity given in newspapers in this country to the results of the drawings; and to photographs of the drawings and of the winners.(ii) That the activities of agents and ticket sellers should be more comprehensive-sively prohibited than is the case under the existing law.Small Lotteries.29. The Royal Commission considered that very small lotteries for small prizes (which are at present illegal though frequently not interfered with by the authorities) do no social harm, and that, provided that the danger of fraud and nuisance can be prevented, there was a good case for removing them from the ambit of the criminal law. The Commission indicated the lines on which they believed that satisfactory exemption could be framed for (a) &apos;&apos; private &apos;&apos; lotteries promoted in clubs, trade union branches and other institutions, and (b) lotteries of the bazaar raffle type.30. We have examined with some care the terms of the exemptions for those small lotteries. There is the danger, on the one hand, that, if the exemptions are framed too loosely, large schemes will be promoted under cover of the exemptions; and, on the other hand, that, if the exemptions are defined too closely, the restrictions will be denounced as pettifogging and as an unjustifiable interference with the liberty of the subject. In the proposals outlined in Appendix III we have attempted to reduce to a minimum the restrictions on the promotion of exempted schemes. We regard as the most important safeguard the elimination of private gain from the promotion of these lotteries.
Competitions.31. Because of the danger that persons may be led into the betting habit, the Commission recommended that competitions for the forecasting of sporting events promoted in newspapers and sometimes by traders should be prohibited altogether; and, in regard to other competitions similarly promoted, the Commission proposed that the value of individual prizes should be limited to  100, and that certain other restrictions should be imposed.We believe that the press generally would welcome a rigid restriction on newspaper competitions.32. We consider that, in the case of competitions promoted both by newspapers and traders, those in which prizes are offered for forecasts of events should be absolutely prohibited; other competitions similarly promoted should be subject to such restrictions as are necessary to ensure that they do -not develop into large-scale lotteries. For these reasons we recommend that there should be a prohibition of all such forecasting competitions, and of all other competitions in which there is not a substantial element of skill.33. We. submit to the Cabinet the following recommendations on which a Cabinet decision is required : (1) The law relating to lotteries, betting and gaming is out of harmony with modern conditions and requires; amendment.As pointed out in paragraph 3 of this Report, two alternative courses are open to the Cabinet, and it is for the Cabinet to decide whether the proposed legislation should (a) deal with the whole subject of lotteries, betting and gaming ona comprehensive basis, or(b) be restricted to the regulation of betting on greyhound tracks(including the use of the totalisator on these tracks) and the measures to be taken to deal with the sale in this country of tickets in large-scale lotteries and particularly in the Irish sweepstakes.(2) If it is decided to proceed on the comprehensive lines of (1) (a) above, we recommend the adoption of the various proposals contained in the sections of this Report headed (A) On-the-Course Betting, (B) Off-the-Course Betting, and (C) Lotteries and Competitions, and Appendices I, II and III respectively.(3) If it is decided to proceed on the more limited lines of (1) (6) above, we recommend that the provisions of the Bill should be confined to our proposals regarding lotteries (including competitions), betting on-the-course (including the regulation of totalisator betting on greyhound tracks), and certain amendments of the Racecourse Betting Act, 1928, relating to the operations of the Racecourse Betting Control Board.(4) In either case Cabinet authority is requested for the preparation of a draft Bill, embodying the Cabinet decisions, with a view to submission to the Cabinet in due course.Signed on behalf of the Committee : JOHN GILMOUR, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, January 1, 1934.
Appendix I.Regulation of On-the-Course Betting. (A) General Regulation of On-the-Course Betting.Licensing of Courses for Betting.1. SUBJECT to the exceptions mentioned below in paragraph 6, betting facilities shall not be provided at any place where racing or any other sporting-event is carried on unless the management of the course has obtained a licence from the Council of the County or County Borough in which the place is situate sanctioning the provision of betting facilities at that place, and shall only be provided under such a licence on the days fixed by the Council under paragraph 11.2. Notice of intention to apply for a licence shall be advertised by the applicant in two newspapers circulating in the district.3. Within a period of one month from the date of the advertisement, the police, resident ratepayers, owners of property, the governing body of any neighbouring institution which considers that it might be adversely affected if the licence applied for were granted, the responsible authority under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932, and local authorities within the licensing district or adjacent local authorities, shall be entitled to make representations to the licensing authority, and the licensing authority shall take such representations into consideration.4. A licence shall not be refused except on one or more of the following grounds : (a) that the health and convenience of residents in the immediate neighbour-hood is likely to be adversely affected, having regard to the density of the population of the neighbourhood;(&amp;) that the interests of children attending schools and of inmates of institutions in close proximity are likely to be adversely affected;(c) the preservation of the amenities of the neighbourhood;(d) if the licensing authority considers that the preservation of law, order or public safety, or the prevention of traffic congestion, might be endangered by the grant of the licence;(e) if the applicant is a person whose licence has been revoked, or who hasbeen convicted of an offence under paragraph 9.The grounds of any refusal to grant a licence shall be stated in writing by the licensing authority.5.   A licence, if granted, shall be for a period of seven years.6.   A licence from the local authority shall not be required in the case of (a) horse racecourses existing on the date of the introduction of the Bill which possess certificates of approval granted by the Racecourse Betting Control Board under the Racecourse Betting Act, 1928;(&amp;) places used for racing or other sporting events, at which betting facilities are provided on not more than eight days in any calendar year. In the case of such places, notification must be given in advance to the Chief Officer of Police of the district in which the place is situated, of any day or days on which it is proposed to provide betting facilities.7. The management of a place (other than an approved horse racecourse or a place used occasionally only (see paragraph 6)) which, on or about the 4th December, 1932, was being used for any racing or sporting event, in connexion with which betting facilities were provided at that place, shall be entitled, if application is made within three months of the passing of this Act, to a licence which shall be valid for a period of five years from the passing of the
Bill, provided that if, during the currency of such a licence, the place in question is used (and betting facilities are provided) for the purpose of a racing or sporting event of any kind for which it was not being used on or about the 4th December, 1932, the licensing authority may revoke the licence. Upon the expiration or revocation of a five-year licence, it will be necessary to obtain a licence in the ordinary way to authorise the provision of betting facilities at the place in question.8. A licence shall be liable to be revoked by a court of quarter sessions having jurisdiction in the district if the court is satisfied on complaint by the licensing authority or by the police that the place in question has been conducted in a disorderly manner, or so as to cause a nuisance.9. It shall be an offence for any person to provide, or to allow to be provided, betting facilities at any place used for racing or other sporting events, which (being subject to the requirement to obtain a licence) is not in possession of a licence from the local authority.Limitation of Betting Occasions.10. Betting facilities shall not be provided at any place used for sporting events on more than 104 days in any calendar year.11. The licensing authority for each area shall prescribe annually by resolution 104 days in each calendar year, on which alone betting facilities may be provided in their area on licensed tracks.12. Betting facilities shall not be provided on Sundays, Christmas Day or Good Friday.13. The licensing authority may delegate its power of granting licences, and of prescribing the days on which betting facilities may be provided, to a Committee of the Council, but there shall be no delegation of these functions to the Councils of County Districts.14. There should be provision enabling licensing authorities to act in combination by means of a joint committee or otherwise if they so desire, for the exercise of their powers.Conduct of Betting Facilities.15. Notwithstanding any provision in any enactment, it shall be lawful for a registered bookmaker and his assistants to occupy a fixed place at a course at which betting facilities may lawfully be provided, with such portable equipment as may reasonably be necessary for the purpose of betting with persons attending the meeting.It shall not be lawful for the management of the course to employ bookmakers or themselves to provide betting facilities other than in the case of dog tracks-totalisator facilities conforming with the conditions prescribed below.16. It shall be lawful for the management of a place at which betting facilities may lawfully be provided to charge a bookmaker for admission to an enclosure for the purpose of the bookmaker&apos;s business five times the amount of the highest charge made to members of the public for admission to that enclosure. A bookmakers&apos;s assistant shall be admitted to an enclosure on the same terms as members of the public.17. It shall be an offence for the management of a place at which betting facilities may lawfully be provided to charge more that the authorised charges, to bookmakers and their assistants.18.   Penalty for an offence under this Act (a) On summary conviction one hundred pounds for every offence, and on a second or subsequent conviction such a fine and three months&apos; imprisonment,(6) On conviction on indictment five hundred pounds for every offence, and on second conviction such a fine and a year&apos;s imprisonment,
and where an offender who holds a licence permitting betting on a course is convicted on indictment, the court may revoke his licence.Provision will be made for the punishment of directors and officers of a company guilty of any offence under the Act.(B) Use of the Totalisator on Greyhound Trades.19. Subject to the provisions set out below, it shall be lawful for the management of a place which is in possession of a licence for betting, or any person authorised by them, to operate a totalisator on days on which greyhound races, but no other races, take place thereon; provided that the days on which the totalisator is operated are the days prescribed for betting by the licensing authority.20. The totalisator shall be mechanically operated, and shall be of a type which conforms with conditions to be prescribed by regulations of the Secretary of State.21. The operators of the totalisator shall distribute or cause to be distributed the whole of the moneys staked by means of the totalisator on any race among the persons winning bets made by means of the totalisator on that race, provided that it shall be lawful for the operators to deduct in respect of each race, an amount not exceeding three per cent, of the total amount of money staked on that race, and provided that the operators shall not be required to pay out to persons winning bets any fraction of a penny.22. Within seven days of the end of each calendar month the operators of the totalisator shall submit to a qualified accountant a statement giving in respect of each race a full and true account of the sums received through the totalisator, of the amount retained by the operators by way of percentage deduction, and by way of &quot; breakages,&quot; and of the dividends paid to the persons making winning bets.23. The accountant, or any person authorised by him to act on his behalf, shall have access at any time to the premises in which the totalisator is operated, for the purpose of inspection, and may during such inspection examine any part of the machinery or the working of the totalisator, and may demand from the operators any information he thinks necessary for the purposes of the inspection.24. If the accountant is satisfied, after such inspection as he deems to be necessary of the operation of the totalisator and after audit of the accounts, that the totalisator has been operated in a proper manner, he may issue a certificate in a form to be prescribed in the Act.25. If within the period of 14 days from the end of the calendar year the operators of a totalisator have not lodged a certificate in the prescribed form with the licensing authority, or if at any time within the course of the year the auditor reports to the licensing authority that the totalisator has not been operated in a proper manner, or that the provisions of this Act have not been complied with, it shall be open to Quarter Sessions, on the application of the licensing authority, to revoke the licence for betting.26. An annual fee not exceeding  50 shall be payable in respect of a totalisator to the licensing authority by the holder of a licence for betting facilities.
APPENDIX II.Regulation of Off-the-Course Betting.Registration of Bookmakers and their Employees.1. NO person shall carry on the business of a bookmaker (which expression includes an agent negotiating bets on behalf of a bookmaker) unless he has registered himself as a bookmaker with the Chief Officer of Police of the police district in which his office is situated. Registration shall be annual, and a person shall be entitled to be registered by the police as a bookmaker on payment of an annual fee of  1 to the police fund.It shall not be lawful for a bookmaker to carry on his business as a bookmaker on any premises used for any other trade or business.In the case of partnerships, firms or companies, or businesses occupying more than one office, all those responsible for the management of the business must be registered.Heayy penalties to be provided against the carrying on of the business of bookmaking by unregistered persons.2. The registration of a bookmaker who has been convicted of an offence involving dishonesty or who has been adjudicated a bankrupt shall be cancelled by the police; and any such person shall not be eligible for registration as a bookmaker for two years from the date of such cancellation, or while he remains an undischarged bankrupt.There shall be a right of appeal to a court of summary jurisdiction from a decision of the police that a bookmaker^ registration must be cancelled or that his application for registration must be refused.There shall be a provision enabling a partnership to get rid of a partner whose registration has been cancelled.Inspection of Premises.3. There will be a provision on the lines of Section 11 of the Betting Act, 1853, empowering Justices to grant a search warrant (with power to seize and detain documents) in respect of premises where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the business of bookmaking is being carried on unlawfully.Betting Facilities which may be provided by Registered Bookmakers^4. Off-the-course betting may be conducted by a registered bookmaker at his office (a) for the receipt of credit bets (as is legal at present) from persons who donot &quot; resort &quot; to the office for the purpose of making bets (i.e., who make credit bets by telephone, telegram or letter);(b) for the receipt through the post of bets on cash terms (which is illegal atpresent) from persons who do not resort to the office. This would enable cash to be sent through the post either for the purpose of betting on a particular race or for the purpose of establishing a deposit account.5. An off-the-course betting business of this character may be carried on by a bookmaker only in a police district in which he is registered. In each police district in which he is registered, a bookmaker must notify to the Chief Officer of Police the address of the office or offices at which he is carrying on his business.6.
