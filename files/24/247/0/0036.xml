This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet, February, 1934SECRET.copy No. f* 5CP. 36 (34).THE CABINETPOLICY IN REGARD TO AFGHANISTANMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for India have circulated a memorandum on the subject of Policy in regard to Afghanistan (OP. 33 (34)), in which they direct attention to certain immediate questions which have been addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul by the Afghan Government and put forward suggestions as to the steps which should be taken to determine the answers to these questions. Their suggestions involve a delay which undoubtedly has serious military as well as political implications, and, in my judgment, is avoidable. I therefore desire to recommend that we should proceed on somewhat different lines.2. The present phase of the Afghan problem cannot be properly appreciated without a brief reference to past history. As my colleagues are aware, the maintenance of Afghanistan as an efficient buffer between Russia and India has been a consistent feature of British policy for a century, and the question of the action that should be taken in the event of Russian aggression directed against Afghanistan has been a subject of careful examination from time to time. For my immediate purpose, however, it will suffice to begin by referring to the last formal enquiry that was held before the Great War.3. In 1907 a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence under the chairmanship of Mr. (later Lord) Morley recorded the following conclusions :  &quot; We accept the view that the gates of India are in Afghanistan ; that the problem of Afghanistan dominates the situation in India ; and that the lines we are pledged to defend determine our true strategic frontier in case of war these are the propositions that have weighed with us in arriving at the conclusion that the frontiers of India and Afghanistan are, from the point of view of Anglo-Russian relations and resistance to designs of aggression, identical.We consider that, alike by definite treaty and by our plain interests, our obligations to guard the independence and integrity of Afghanistan are unimpaired ; and that the deliberate crossing of the Oxus or the occupation of Herat by Russia would be the violation of a frontier which we are bound to defend.We therefore assume that Russian action of the kind indicated would be followed by a declaration of war against that Power.&quot;4. The Committee of Imperial defence accepted the above conclusion as a general guide to the policy to be adopted in the event of Russian aggression directed against India.5. Among the signatories to the report of the Sub-Committee were Mr. Morley himself, Mr. Asquith (later Lord Oxford and Asquith), Sir Edward (later Lord) Grey, Mr. (later Lord) Haldane, and Lieutenant-General Sir John (later Lord) French ; while Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman presided at the meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence at which the report was approved.6s. In 1919 there occurred a fundamental change in our relations with Afghanistan. Up to that time her foreign affairs had been under our control and her boundaries with Russia were defined in British treaties. We, for our part, paid the Amir an annual subsidy in cash and were bound by solemn engagements to assist him in repelling unprovoked aggression. In short, Afghanistan was a protected State within our orbit.i C.I.D. Paper No. 98-D.s C.I D. Minutes, 98th Meeting.3 Paragraphs 6 and 7 are almosi verbatim quotations from the reports of Lord Birkenhead&apos;s Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 158-D).
In 1919 the Amir Habibullah, who throughout the war had been staunch to his engagements, was assassinated. Amanulla seized the throne by ousting the recognized heir-apparent and, within four months of his accession, delivered a wanton and entirely unprovoked attack on India. This was repelled without real difficulty, but the treaty of good neighbourliness, which was concluded after protracted negotiations, ushered in an entirely new phase in our relations with Afghanistan. Her ruler is now wholly independent of us. No longer have we any control over his foreign affairs. No longer do we pay him a cash subsidy. No longer are we pledged to assist him to repel aggression.Soviet Russia was not slow to take advantage of the opportunities which the events of 1919 presented to her. All the Czarist treaties including, of course, the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907-had been ostentatiously torn up. Afghanistan on her own initiative had thrown off the British yoke. The door which had so long been closed could now or so it seemed be prized open. In 1921 the Russo-Afghan Treaty, with its million rouble subsidy, its gifts of aeroplanes and munitions, and its promises of assistance of various kinds, was formally ratified. Afghanistan was no longer in our single orbit.73. Towards the end of 1925 an acute Russo-Afghan crisis arose over the forcible occupation by the Russians of Urta Tagai, an island in the River Oxus, which had for many years been in the de facto possession of the Afghans. Afghan amour propre was inflamed and serious trouble seemed imminent. This particular storm blew over, but it brought into prominence the necessity for a searching examination of the larger questions which lay behind it. If Russian policy in Asia was to hem in India with a circle of Bolshevik States, and if northern Afghanistan was destined to be the next region to be drawn into the orbit of the U.S.S.R., what was to be the policy of Great Britain ? Was it essential for the safety of India that we should actively intervene to prevent any violation of Afghanistan&apos;s integrity ? And if so, what steps should be taken now, and in the future, to render our intervention possible and effective ?8. These questions were remitted in 1927 to a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence under the chairmanship of Lord Birkenhead. This Sub-Committee included Lord Balfour, Sir Austen Chamberlain, Lord Salisbury, Mr. Winston Churchill, Sir Samuel Hoare, Lord Peel, the Chiefs of Staff at the time, and the Secretary, Military Department, India Office.The enquiry extended over a period of nine months in the course of which evidence was taken from Lord Reading, Lord Haig, Sir Francis Humphrys (then British Minister in Kabul), Sir Denys Bray (then Foreign Secretary to the Government of India), Sir Andrew Skeeu (then Chief of the General Staff in India), and other highly qualified witnesses.9. As the result of this searching examination Lord Birkenhead&apos;s Sub-Committee satisfied themselves that (a) despice the fundamental change in our  relations with Afghanistan (see para. 6 above), and irrespective of moral obligations, the material conse-quences of any substantial Russian encroachment would be no less dangerous to India and no less disastrous to our general interests thau they would have been in the past ; and that(b) we had the military power not to prevent a Russian violation and temporaryoccupation of the northern part of Afghanistan, but, in co-operation with the Afghans, to turn them out as the result of a more or less prolonged war.10. Accordingly, they submitted a comprehensive report in which they (a) unanimously and categorically recommended the reaffirmation of the policyformulated by Mr. Morley&apos;s Sub-Committee (see para. 3 above) : and(b) suggested the measures which might be taken at once, and in the future, torender our intervention possible and effective.11. The Sub-Committee^ report was accepted by the Government of India, endorsed in its entirety by the Committee of Imperial Defence5, and approved by the Cabinet6 in February, 1928.3 Paragraphs 6 and 7 are almost verbatim quotations from the reports of Lord Birkenhead&apos;s Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 158-D). 1 C.I.D. Paper No. 158 D.5 C.I.D. Minutes, 232nd Meeting (Minute 2), and C.I.D. Paper No. 162 D. u Cabinet 11 (28), Conclusion 4.
12. In May, 1929, Amanulla fled the country, and, with his disappearance, many of the specific measures proposed by Lord BirkenheacTs Sub-Committee became obsolete. But the principle that governed their recommendations, namely the desirability of &quot;yetting closer&quot; to Afghanistan, became valid again as soon as Nadir Khan had re-established a stable central government towards the end of 1929 ; and it is valid today.    The next move, however, was to come from the Afghans themselves.13.7 In April, 1931, the Afghan Foreign Minister enquired of the British Minister at Kabul what the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the Govern-ment of India would be in the event of war between Russia and Afghanistan. He i asked whether, in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Soviet, Afghanistan could count on any kind of support from His Majesty&apos;s Government, and stated that, without knowledge of the answer to this question, the foreign policy of his Govern-ment must, remain fluid and opportunist, necessitating an attitude of surrender towards any demands which the Soviet Government might make and press home. Sir R. Maconachie was instructed to give a reply, the main substance of which was that since British interests include the maintenance of a strong, independent and friendly Afghanistan, His Majesty&apos;s Government naturally could not regard with indifference unprovoked aggression by a foreign Power against a friendly Afghanistan, but that the exact steps to be taken in that event must depend upon the circumstances of the moment.14. In March 1932, the Afghan Government returned to the charge. In a long interview with Sir R. Maconachie8, the Afghan Prime Minister, and Foreign Minister, enumerated the embarrassing demands which were being pressed upon them by the Soviet. They stated that they had hitherto rejected or evaded these demands, but doubted whether they could continue that attitude indefinitely. They therefore asked for information inter alia as to what would be the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India, or the League of Nations, if the Soviet attacked Afghanistan. They added &quot; these questions were vital and urgent, since on the answers to them would depend the attitude of the Afghan Government towards the Soviet in future, and the possibility of their maintaining their present relations, as they sincerely desired to do, with His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;915. In October, 1932, after a lapse of some six months, the questions dealt with in the preceding paragraph were referred to the Cabinet in a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for India10. As a result, the Cabinet approved the draft of a despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul which authorized him inter alia to give a specific assurance that in the event of a serious and clearly unprovoked aggression of Afghan territory by Russia His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared, if diplomatic intervention failed, to break off relations (including officiai commercial relations) with the Soviet Government.16. 1 now come to a point to which I desire to draw the particular attention of my colleagues, since it indicates the misconception which has been responsible for the delays of the last two years, and which, if it remains unconnected, will cause further serious and dangerous delay.My point is this. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for India appear to think that the Cabinet, in approving the above despatch, decided that a re-examination of policy was necessary by reason of the fact that the following incidental passage was included in it : &quot; In this connection His Majesty&apos;s Government have noted that the Defence of India Committee of 1927, whose report was approved hy the Cabinet of that time, assumed (paragraph 41 of their report) that Russian action of the kind in question would in fact in the last resort be followed by a declaration of war against that Power. But that report is now five years old, and it may be11 that the questions dealt with therein are in need of re-examination by the Committee of Imperial Defence.&quot;17. Obviously the recommendations put forward by the Defence of India Committee as to the steps which should be taken to improve our relations with Afghanistan and so forth became obsolete with the disappearance of Amannlla.   To7 Para. 13 is an almost verbatim extract from a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for India.   (CP. 300 (152).) 8 CP. 300 (32), para. (4). &apos; CP. 300 (32), para. (5). 1&quot; CP. 300 (32). 11 The italics are mine.
this extent it is of course true that a measure of reconsideration is called for. But I can see no justification for holding that, because the Cabinet approved a despatch containing the above tentative, I might almost say incidental, expression of opinion, it should be taken for granted that a re-examination of the broad question of policy must be undertaken. I am strengthened in this opinion by the fact that the despatch in question advanced no reason whatever to support the conclusion that a re-examination of this magnitude was called for. In any event it is my purpose to show that no such re-examination is necessary.18. It will be seen from paras. 9 and 10 that Lord Birkenhead&apos;s Sub-Committee based their recommendations as to the policy that should be adopted in the event of a &apos; Russian violation of Afghanistan on two factors, namely : (a) that the material consequences of any substantial Russian encroachment wouldbe no less disastrous to our interests than they would have been in the past; and(b) that we had the military power to afford us a reasonable expectation of beiny-able to force the Russians out again.19. As regards the first factor I should be surprised if any arguments could be produced to suggest that anything has happened in the last six years to render the consequences of any substantial Russian encroachment one whit less disastrous than they have always been.20. If this be correct, it is evident that the argument for re-examination rests on the supposition that there has been some material change since 1927 in the second factor ; and this is borne out by the following extracts from CP. 33 (34), para. 4 :  &quot; . . . It follows that in any re-examination of the policy accepted in 1928, one of the first questions to be decided is whether we now have the military power to enforce that policy&quot; : and again, para. 5 : &quot;. . . The Cabinet might now request the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence to consider existing plans .... and report whether we have the resources required to enforce the policy accepted in 1928.&quot; I regard both the argument and the conclusion as fallacious.21. It is of course true that, since 1927, Soviet Russia has considerably strengthened her military power, particularly by the development of air and mechanized forces and of her capacity for the output of armaments of all kinds, although il has yet to be shown that her inherent defects in the matter of organisation and administration do not still persist. It is of course equally true that our existing armed forces have not increased correspondingly in quantity, although their standard of efficiency, particularly in air and mechanized forces, is second to none in the world.22. But, when all is said and done, a detailed comparison of the relative military strengths of the British Empire on the one side and the Soviet on the other at any given moment would not help us very much, since military strength is not constant. Such an examination conducted to-day might give one result ; in a few years time a fresh examination might well furnish us with a different answer. Our policy in a matter of this importance cannot change, almost from year to year, with fluctuations in the actual organizations and establishments of our own and the Russian forces : it is the potential war effort that can be developed by either side which is the all-important factor. Consequently it is not so much a question whether we have at this moment the military power to maintain the integrity of Afghanistan, as a general proposition whether the British Empire has a reasonable expectation of being able to enforce her will upon Russia in defence of her vital interests, whensoever they may be threatened. Viewed from this standpoint, I contend that our potential capacity for war is just as great as it was in the war of 1914-1918, and I refuse to accept the idea that the British Empire is any less capable of forcing the Russians to evacuate Northern Afghanistan than it was in 1927. So long as Afghanistan remains an efficient buffer between Soviet Russia and India we shall have the necessary time margin for the development of our war effort. Once, however, the integrity of Afghanistan is impaired, the time margin which is so vital to us would decrease in proportion to every important advance which Russia might make beyond the present frontier.To sum up, I contend that, if a friendly Afghanistan is violated by Russia and invites our assistance, we still have the military power to restore her integrity, and therefore that the second factor on which was based the policy accepted by the Cabinet in 1928 remains substantially unchanged.23. Should any of my colleagues doubt my conclusion, I would remind them that the establishment of Russian influence in Afghanistan would be a &quot; most serious threat
not only to security of India and peace of the frontier but even to the stability of the Empire. So long as we can keep a strong and independent Afghanistan between ourselves and Russia, the Empire has no land frontier of importance on which we can be forced into war by any foreign Power in circumstances unfavourable to ourselves. If, however, Russian influence becomes predominant in Afghanistan and Afghan independence is threatened, we should be confronted before long with a land frontier 500 miles in length against a major European Power which would involve us in military commitments and expense far beyond any which we at present contemplate.&quot;12Were we to allow such a situation to develop we would, in the words of Lord Balfour, run the risk of &quot; throwing upon our children, if not upon ourselves, the greatest military problem that has ever confronted the Government of this country.&quot;13Surely then we have no choice as to the broad policy that we should follow, and there is no need, particularly in view of the danger of delay, to await the detailed plan, which our military advisers are elaborating in accordance with instructions issued by the Cabinet in 192S,1J before reaffirming a policy which has been consistently followed by successive Governments.24. The conclusions that suggest themselves may be summarized as follows : (a) The specific questions that have been put to our Minister at Kabul by theAfghan Government have not been placed before the Committee of Imperial Defence because it was wrongly considered that their consideration must involve an enquiry of the same searching scope and character as that conducted by Lord Birkenhead&apos;s Sub-Committee, a task of such magnitude as His Majesty&apos;s Ministers, owing to other overwhelming preoccupations, could not be expected to undertake.(b) It has, however, been shown in the preceding paragraphs that, since theenquiry of Lord Birkenhead&apos;s Sub-Committee, there has been no material change in either of the fundamental factors on which the Sub-Committee based their recommendations as to policy. There is, therefore, no justifica-tion for altering this policy or for embarking upon an exhaustive re-examination of ground that has been so recently and so thoroughly explored. In other words the Committee of Imperial Defence could have addressed themselves forthwith to the specific questions put to us by the Afghan Government, taking the policy accepted by the Cabinet in 1928 as their starting point, and the whole matter could have been settled without any undue delay.(c) The delays which have already taken place have, in my judgment, beenunnecessary. Not only that, they have been dangerous. They may not have exhausted the patience of the Afghan Government, but they must have tried it severely. Any further delay might well be the last straw and might result in driving the Afghans into the arms of Russia. In expressing this apprehension I have the support of the Government of India and His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul. &quot; We regret the delay anticipated,&quot; say the Government of India, &quot; and hope that arguments put forward in our Despatch No. 1 Secret Frontier of 1934 will convince you of the desirability of expediting the matter.&quot;16 &quot; I still feel,&quot; telegraphs our Minister at Kabul on 16th January, 1934, &quot;that since first phase of delay has now lasted over two years, time has come to make some gesture, which would at any rate give Afghans reason to think that we are taking their requests seriously.&quot;1625. To return to the immediate issues, our Minister at Kabul reported on loth October, 1933 (his Forminka No. 37) that the Afghan Prime Minister had stated that : (a) &quot; The Soviet Military Attache had put forward proposal for continuation of new northern road due north from Haibak to the Oxus with bridge over the latter, to which the Russian railway system might be extended, and had said that substantial assistance in money would be given for this project by the Soviet Government.12 Government of India telegram to Secretary of State for India No. 1993, of 10th September, 1932.13 Hansard, Parliamentary Debates, 4th Series, Vol. 146, col. S4 (11th May, 1905). 14 Cabinet 11 (28), Conclusion 4.16 Government of India telegram to Secretary of State for India No. 114 of 19th January, 1934. 18 Telegram No. 8 from His Majest,y&apos;s Minister at Kabul of 16th January, 1934.
(6) The Afghan Government must now seriously consider defence of the northern road, in connection with which they wished to consult British General Staff.(c) The Afghan Government needed arms and ammunition and aircraft for which tbey could pay, but only by instalments &quot;.He added that it would be very difficult to stave off enquiries, and that he would be grateful for information regarding progress of the case.26. I anticipated that these new and important advances on the part of the Afghan Government would either be referred as early as possible to the Committee of Imperial Defence, or, failing that, would at least be made the subject of interdepartmental consultation. In view of the military implications, I certainly never contemplated that a postponement of the issue would be decided upon without some reference to the interested Service Departments.   This, however, is what has happened.27. On 8th January, 1934, i.e., nearly three months after the latest Afghan representations, the Foreign Office despatched the telegram of which an extract is appended. This telegram starts off with the argument (which I have tried to prove erroneous) that a re-examination of the whole question of policy is an indispensable preliminary to the consideration of the specific questions that the Afghans have put to us. It then goes on to say that the &quot; question of policy must depend on whether we have the military power to enforce it, and cannot be adequately considered until Imperial and Indian General Staffs have agreed on a plan of action.&quot; I have already dealt with the argument as regards existing military power. As regards a plan of action I need only say that the General Staffs are already in agreement on the first phase of the operations (which is based upon the outline approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1928). Subsequent steps must depend on enemy action and the general course of the war, and the General Staffs are elaborating alternative plans to meet the various situations that may arise later. But, here again, there is no case for re-opening decisions as to policy or for postponing consideration of the questions immediately at issue.28. The only other point in the telegram to which it is necessary to invite attention is the observation that there will be a delay of four or five months before any of the questions at issue, except the gift of munitions, can be settled. In the light of what has happened since, the Afghans made their first advance nearly three years ago, 1 cannot but regard this estimate of the probable delay as being optimistic ; but, in any case, I consider that a delay of even this limited duration is unnecessary, and, as explained in para. 24 (c), that it is dangerous.29. The questions at immediate issue may be summarised as follows : (i) Are we going to give the Afghan Government an assurance that, in the eventof an unprovoked violation of their northern frontier by Russia, we will give them military assistance ?(ii) Are we going to accede to the request of the Afghan Government for militaryadvice regarding the defence of their northern frontier in general, and of the north road in particular ?(iii) Are we going to accede to the Afghan request for arms and ammunition, andfor aircraft ?I would earnestly urge my colleagues that they should now reaffirm categorically and immediately the policy accepted by the Cabinet in 1928, that they should inform the Defence of India Sub-Committee accordingly, and instruct them to consider, on that basis, and with the least possible delay, the specific questions detailed in the preceding paragraph.H.The War Office,8ifA February, 1934.P.S. Since writing the above I have had an opportunity of reading Government of India Despatch, No. 1 Secret Frontier, of 4th January, 1934. It appears to me to reinforce strongly the views I have put forward.
APPENDIXP.Z. 8318/33.Cypher telegram from Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty1 s Minister, Kabul,dated 8th January, 1934SECRET. XXXIMPORTANT.   No. 3.*****2. I now fear that it will not be practicable for some time for Defence of India Committee to consider question of policy in the event of a substantial Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the question raised in penultimate paragraph of Government of India&apos;s telegram No. 404 K of 25th November. Question of policy must depend on whether we have military power to enforce it, and cannot be adequately considered until Imperial and Indian General Staffs have agreed on a plan of action. But, apart from the fact that Secretary of State for India will be fully occupied with Indian constitutional reforms during early part of this year, four or five months must elapse before agreed military plan is completed.* * * * * -(b34/8)   70   2/34   w.o.p.   7620
