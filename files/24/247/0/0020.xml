TENTH  REPORT.Survey of the economic situation, January 1934.Part 1. Survey of recent economic developments.1. THE principal economic event since our last report has been the further depreciation of the dollar as a result of the gold-buying policy announced by President Roosevelt in his speech of the 22nd October last. The average daily rate for the dollar in the months succeeding the banking crisis of March has been as follows : Table 1. Dollar sterling exchange. Average of daily rates.1933- 1933-March         ...      ... 3-433            August ...... 4-505April......      ... 3-586            September ...... 4-661May   ...      ,..... 3-939            October ...... 4-668June......... 4-142            November ...... 5 137July......... 4-644            December ...... 5 1182. Since the new policy was announced the fluctuations in the exchange rate have been as follows : Table 2. Dollar sterling exchange.Weekly fluctuations since October 22, 1933.

It will be observed that when the. Reconstruction Finance Corporation first began to buy gold, the official price of gold was higher than that which the dollar sterling exchange and the market price in London justified. Subsequently, the dollar, under the influence of a bear movement, depreciated at a much faster rate than the changes in the internal price of gold warranted. Finally, however, the dollar recovered, and the official price of gold in New York is now very much above the equivalent of the market price in London. This recovery of the dollar does not indicate any real confidence that its value will not fail further. It represents, rather, the natural reaction from the previous bear movement, in the absence of any confident expectation of a further fall. It was announced on the -2nd January that the purchases of gold abroad by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation amounted to just over 50 million dollars.5. The franc has also displayed weakness relative to sterling, the rate falling from about 80 to the pound, near which figure it stood throughout September and October, to 84^ to the pound on the 30th November. The rate, however, subsequently rallied to 83 during December. The gold holding of the Bank of France fell from 82,277 million francs on the 1st September to 77,098 million francs on the 29th December, a decline of over 5 milliard francs. During the same period the foreign balances of the Bank of France fell by 1,497 million francs, from 2,639 millions to 1,142 millions. Thus the combined holding of gold and foreign exchange of the Bank of France fell by 6,676 million francs, equivalent at the current rate of exchange to about  80 million.6. During November there was a heavy discount on both forward francs and forward dollars, with the result that considerable funds were attracted or returned to the London money market. In spite of this, however, the advance in the short-term rate of interest, which was brought about during October by the concerted action of the joint stock banks, was maintained until the last days of the year. As a result of this action, the rate on Treasury bills was raised from a figure of less than 5s. per cent, during September to over  1 3s. in mid-December, though it has since fallen back to 18s. lid.7. The movement of commodity prices in the principal countries is shown in the following table :

The increased buying power in the hands of the public resulting from the increased industrial activity in the summer seems now to be making itself felt.11. Electricity production in Great Britain showed an increase, compared with the corresponding month of 1932, of 13 per cent, in October, of 15-4 per cent, in November and of 21 per cent, in December. The comparable increases in July, August and September were 13-1, 11-4 and 10 - 8 per cent, respectively. Building plans passed by 146 local authorities (excluding London) were valued at  6,981,800 in October 1933, compared with  6,505,100 in October 1932. The fourth quarter of 1932 was relatively satisfactory in this respect. Steel production in the United Kingdom has, since September, been upon a level which was last attained in May 1930. The output of steel in September, October and November last was 669,000, 668,300 and 695,000 tons respectively. The output for the three months is over 50 per cent, higher than last year. Moreover, the extent to which stocks have been lately drawn upon pending an increase in the supply of coke, the number of blast furnaces blown in during December, and the rise in the price of scrap all indicate the probability of a further increase in output in the near future. Railway freight traffics also maintained a satisfactory rate of improvement, the figures for the last quarter of the year showing an increase of 6-6 per cent, compared with the corresponding period in 1932.12. In the United States the recession in business activity which began in July of this year continued up to the end of October. The Federal Reserve Board seasonally, adjusted index of industrial production, which rose from 60 in March to 100 in July, fell to 91 in August, to 84 in September, to 77 in October and to 73 in November. The course of business in recent weeks may be judged from the weekly index published by the New York Times.%10. There is no indication that advance in industrial activity has so far received any check in this country. The latest figures for employment are encouraging : Table 7.
November 4   ...      ...   71-8            December 2   ....... 74-7November 11......   73-0             December 9    ...... 74-7November 18......   73-9            December 16...... 77-1November 25 ......   74-8            December 23 ...... 77-6December 30 ...... 79-613. There was some fall in the level of United States Government bonds in the course of November. For example, 3 per cent. United States Treasury bonds repayable in 1951-55, which had been as high as 99^ in the course of this year, fell during the week ending the 25th November to 93^. Subsequently there was some recovery, the United States Treasury supporting the market partly by purchasing bonds on a modest scale and partly by bringing pressure to bear on banks and other financial institutions to avoid sales. The Presidents budget message to Congress has been followed by a further but not very serious decline. Since the 9th November, 1932, there has been no substantial increase in the Federal Reserve Bank&apos;s holding of government securities.14. Evidence accumulates that there has been a distinct slackening off of economic activity in France since the summer of this year. The index of pro-duction published by the Statistique Generate, which reached 112 in July, fell to 111 in August, to 110 in September, to 108 in October, and 107 in November. The decline in traffic receipts in comparison with the previous year, which up to the end of September amounted to approximately 6 per cent., has been as follows during recent weeks :- Table 9.Percentage change in weekly French railway traffic^ receipts as compared with corresponding week in 1932.Week ending 			Week ending 			October 7	- 6	84	November 11		7	29October 14	- 6	63	November 18	4-	1	07October 21	- 7	67	November 25	. &apos;-&apos; -	2	84October 28	- 9	-25	December   2    ...	4-	1	05November 4	- 8	60	December   9	) -&apos;	4	5915. There was a more than seasonal increase in France between the end of September and the middle of November in the number of unemployed in receipt of relief. The numbers registered as unemployed at the French employ-ment exchanges increased from 263,000 in August to 287,000 in November. Reference has already been made to the loss of gold by the Bank of France. This loss has been accompanied by a reduction in private deposits at the Bank of France from 17,069 million francs on the 1st September to 13,193 million on the 29th December. There has been some tightening of the money market in France. Apart from the statistical indications of a worsening economic position, there has been a marked development of depression psychology in recent weeks.16. The German situation appears, in so far as it is correctly reflected in the statistics of employment and unemployment, to be still improving. Employ-ment and unemployment figures in recent months have been as follows : * including passenger receipts.New York Times index of business activity. Computed normal - 100.

There has been some increase in building activity in Germany in recent months.Table 11.Building activity in German communes with 10,000 or more inhabitants.Number of Buildings.September. 1933. 1932.Nine months to September. 1933. 1932.Contracts given Buildings begun Buildings finished7,888 8,216 9,7065,867 6,388 7,71751,295 46,335 62,11943,817 40,709 45,85318. Despite the favourable statistical indications, the extent to which there is a genuine economic recovery in Germany is very doubtful. There is reason to suspect that many businesses are at present being carried on at a loss; and, although, ostensibly, reductions in wage-rates are avoided, it appears to be not uncommon for employers to effect the same result by changing the classification of workers to grades carrying lower rates of pay. The effective incomes of the wage-earners are, moreover, curtailed by large deductions by way of contribution to Nazi party funds, winter relief, &amp;e, while, on the other hand, the cost of living-is kept high by the dearness of foodstuffs resulting from extreme agricultural protection. The consequent decline in the effective purchasing power of the mass of the population is reflected in a poor volume of retail trade, the business of the large stores, which were originally the object of Nazi attack, having declined considerably, without any very apparent benefit to the smaller traders. In these circumstances, the future course of German economic activity remains highly uncertain.19. The gold value of world trade as measured by the League of Nations index remained comparatively stable throughout the third quarter of last year.

British freight trade returns continued to show satisfactory results until the end of November. In December, however, there was a decline in the exports of United Kingdom produce as compared with the previous year. It is too early to judge whether this represents a setback to the recent improvement, or is merely fortuitous.Table 13.British foreign trade in 1932 and 1933.	Imports.

Part 2. Possible repercussions from the United States.21. The recovery in Great Britain, as the above survey shows, continued to make steady progress in the concluding months of 1933. In our last report, dated the 24th October, 1933, we analysed the underlying conditions, which pointed, in our judgment, to the conclusion that the recovery in Great Britain was &quot; soundly based,&quot; and we expressed the view that, subject to the possibility of adverse repercussions from abroad, &apos;&apos; the economic outlook for Great Britain seems to us more hopeful than it has been at any time since the depression began.&quot; Among the adverse repercussions that were possible, we indicated the following : &quot; (a) the possibility of a severe and prolonged industrial set-back in the United States;(&amp;) the possibility of a substantial further depreciation in the American dollar, as the result of the arrangements lately announced for controlling its gold value;(c) the possibility that the gold countries may find their position insupportable and abandon the gold standard.&quot;These possibilities still represent in our judgment the only real source of danger to the sustained progress of the British recovery. It is desirable, accordingly, to examine once again the rapidly changing situation in the United States..22. The set-back to American industrial activity which we noted in our last report continued into November, but, as our survey in part 1 suggests, it has now been arrested, and there appears to be a general expectation in the United States of an improvement in the volume. of business activity in the New Year. We are, on the whole, hopeful that this general expectation will be realised. We place small reliance in this connection on the effects of the administration^ &quot; gold-buying &quot;policy, as announced in recent weeks. We are doubtful, moreover, whether the codes under the National Industrial Recovery Act are likely to prove, on the whole, a helpful influence. It should be observed, however, that there is a growing measure of sympathy and support among&quot; American industrialists for the code system, the idea being widespread that unregulated individualism had proved disastrous and that the code system, which appears to be undergoing various modifications, in practice, may pave the way for better co-ordinated industrial arrangements.23. The policy of the administration in regard to public works and expenditure generally is likely, we think, at this juncture to prove of material assistance to recovery. There are signs that orders are now being placed on a substantial scale under the public works programme, and these orders (including replacement orders by the railways as a result of government financial assistance) are probably mainly responsible for the recent slight increase in activity in the iron and steel trades and in the building trades. Recently, moreover, with the idea of bridging the interval which must elapse before the public works programme is operating with its maximum effect, a new organisation entitled the Civil Works Administration has been set up, charged with the task of finding temporary work for some millions of unemployed. It appears that the Civil Works Administration, which is not hampered by having to weigh the utility of the work provided, is already succeeding in finding temporary jobs and paying-wages to very large numbers of men. Whatever the ultimate effects of this new departure may prove to be, the immediate effects should undoubtedly be helpful to the restoration of economic activity, since in this way a substantial volume of purchasing power is being put into the hands of the consuming public. Similarly, the financial position of the agricultural community has undoubtedly been materially improved, partly as the result of higher prices and partly as the result of the substantial financial assistance given in one form or another by the federal government. A steady increase in the purchases of manufactured goods by farmers, who represent a very important part of the consuming public of the
United States, may therefore reasonably be expected. More generally, the very magnitude of the excess of expenditure over receipts, disclosed in the President&apos;s budget message to Congress, though this probably greatly overstates the expen-diture which will actually be incurred, indicates the substantial scale upon which federal government finance is being used to swell the money incomes or to liquefy the assets of the American people.24. It is, of course, conceivable that the stimulus to trade which the increase in effective purchasing power brought about by this expenditure would be likely to supply might be frustrated by a renewal of acute financial distrust. It is sometimes suggested, for example, that misgivings attributable to the heavy financial commitments which the government is incurring in connection with its recovery policies may lead to a heavy fall in the prices of government bonds which may again undermine the solvency of the banking system and lead to a new financial panic. In view, however, of the large resources with which the govern-ment might support the market in case of need, we think it very unlikely that any serious danger will arise under this head in the near future, whatever may be the ultimate consequences to federal government finance and the level of American taxation, in regard to which matters the United States is in a stronger position to take risks than other countries, such as Great Britain. On the other hand, the prices of American Government bonds may be adversely affected to a material extent by distrust on the part of foreign holders.25. The extent to which the United States programme of public expendi-ture will be effective in stimulating revival, instead of merely preventing further deterioration, is another matter. Hitherto various deflationary influences, such as the liquidation of closed banks, have been operating on a scale sufficiently large to absorb much of the benefit of the expenditure incurred by the government. Much will depend on how strongly such deflationary influences are likely to continue to operate. There can be no reasonable doubt, however, particularly in view of the experience of m other countries, that the depression in the United States has now reached a stage at which the underlying conditions are much more favourable to recovery than they were two years ago, apart altogether from government intervention. During the last few years manufacturers and traders have allowed their stocks to run down and plant has been allowed to fall into disrepair. During last summer there was an important &quot; re-stocking movement,&apos;&quot; based largely on the expectation of increased consumption. There remains the impulse to recovery which would be supplied by any widespread tendency to undertake plant renewals, including the substitution of up-to-date for obsolescent machinery. Hitherto, as we have pointed out in previous reports, the recovery programme has failed to set this tendency in motion on any important scale, and it is chiefly on account of this failure that we have regarded the American recovery as having been less soundly based than our own. None the less, the arrears of plant renewals which have accumulated in the United States during the last few years must be heavy; the natural disposition to overtake these arrears as soon as a reasonable degree of business confidence is established must be correspondingly strong, and is likely to become. stronger with the passage of time. We have thus as a fundamental fact underlying the whole American problem that the extreme curtailment of constructional activity which has ensued during the course of the depression supplies a natural basis for a considerable recovery.26. With this natural basis to work upon, we are of opinion that the expenditure policies of the federal government will serve on balance to promote recovery, and we are optimistic therefore that there is likely to be a definite increase in American industrial activity in the near future. On the other hand, the recovery in the United States is based on less reliable foundations than it is in Great Britain, and is exposed to correspondingly greater possibilities of subsequent reaction. A substantial reduction in the present very high level of interest rates, particularly industrial interest rates, is an essential condition for any sustained recovery. In the meantime, real business confidence has still to be Testored in the United States, and until this is achieved the course of recovery is likely to be chequered.   But so far as Great Britain is concerned, there is no
reason to apprehend that our recovery, which has stood up so well against the American setback of the past few months, is likely to be exposed to any further strain in the immediate future from the first of the possible adverse repercussions (mentioned in paragraph 21), viz., the possibility of a severe and prolonged industrial setback in the United States.27. The possibility, of an indefinite continuance of a heavily depreciated dollar opens out a far more serious danger to British industry and to world stability generally. Since the departure of the United States from the gold standard in April 1933, the depreciation of the dollar has been a constant source of anxiety to the outside world. But until the adoption of the gold-buying policy towards the end of October, it was possible to hope that American policy taken as a whole might do more to help than to retard recovery in other countries. For a considerable period, the growing exchange depreciation of the dollar was accompanied by a substantial increase in the costs of production in American industry under the new codes of fair competition, and also by the very marked improvement which took place in the summer months in American industrial activity. The increase in costs went a long way in some industries to offset the lower exchange value of the dollar so far as competitive conditions for manu-f actured exports in international markets were concerned, and in this connection it must be borne in mind that immediately prior to the American departure from gold, sterling was probably under-valued relatively to other currencies, including the dollar. Meanwhile, the rapid American business recovery led to an increase of imports, of every description and contributed accordingly to the general economic improvement of the world. For these reasons in our discussion of the question in our seventh and eighth reports we took the view that so long as recovery in the United States proceeded without any serious interruption, the effects of the American experiment were likely to prove on balance advantageous to the outside world.28. But the adoption of the &quot; gold -buying &quot; policy at the end of October has materially changed the outlook. For this opens out the possibility, though the latest developments make this less likely, of a further gradual, but substantial, fall in the dollar, without any assurance, or, indeed, likelihood, that this will be accompanied by a commensurate rise in American costs of production. Wherever, accordingly, American industry competes with British industry in world markets, the former is likely to be in a position to undersell the latter by a margin which may become very large if the gold depreciation of the dollar is carried to the full extent of the 50 per cent, authorised by Congress, and would be considerable if the President took steps to make his present gold price effective. Again, wherever American agriculture is in competition with the agriculture of those Dominions or other countries which are linked with sterling, the interests of the latter will be liable to suffer, the most probable outcome being a rise in the dollar prices of the commodities concerned by a percentage less than that of the exchange depreciation of the dollar, and a fall in their sterling price. It is true that American exports consist largely of specialities such as particular varieties of machinery and motor-cars and household appliances and particular varieties of tobacco and cotton, which are not in very direct competition with the.products of other countries. But even in such cases there is an important element of indirect competition; the range of goods in which there is direct competition is considerable, and a fall of the dollar to a point at which American goods generally were much cheaper than those of other countries could hardly fail to stimulate American competition in commodities and markets where it has recently become negligible or has hitherto scarcely existed.29. In view of the time-lag between the placing of orders and their fulfil-ment, the favourable British foreign trade returns for recent months must be regarded as reflecting the results of the trading position before the &quot;gold-buying &apos;&apos; policy was begun. It is noteworthy that almost the whole of the welcome increase in British exports during the third quarter of 1933 as compared with the third quarter of 1932. is attributable to an increase in exports to foreign countries. As the following table shows our exports to countries within the Empire showed only a slight increase in the third quarter of 1933, as compared with 1932, and a reduction as compared with 1931.

Thus it is impossible to attribute the improvement in British exports to the specially favoured position which we enjoy in Empire markets. A more detailed analysis of the increase in British exports yields instructive results.Table 15.British exports in the third quarter of 1933 compared with the third quarter of(a) Countries to which exports showed large changes.-	1932.		1933.

Thus the market which contributed by far the most to the increase of British exports was the United States. It is true that this increase is largely accounted for by tin, the exports of which increased in the quarter in question by just over  2,000,000 and that this item is attributable to the adventitious factor of the exhaustion of stocks under the tin restriction scheme rather than to a genuine improvement of trade. Even, however, if this item be excluded, the remaining increase in our exports to the United States during this quarter is noteworthy. The large increases in our exports to south American countries, such as Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, and to Canada, countries within easy reach of the United States, are also noteworthy. These facts suggest strongly that the American experiment in its earlier phases was helpful rather than adverse to the trade of Great Britain and of the world as a whole, and confirm the optimistic expectations which we expressed in earlier reports.32. But the same facts suggest that if, as the result of the gold-buying development, the influence of American policy upon our trade now becomes predominantly detrimental, the recent improvement in our export trade may be highly precarious. We can hardly hope, in face of a seriously undervalued dollar, to export increasing quantities of goods to the United States herself, and under such conditions we shall be hard put to it to hold our own in other countries on the American continent. It is true that the flow of international trade is determined in an increasing degree by the terms of bilateral trade agreements, as distinct from ordinary price considerations; and in some markets the trade agreements which we have recently concluded may help us to increase our trade despite adverse competitive conditions. So far as we can gather, moreover, the order book position of export manufacturers remains satisfactory upon the whole, although there are indications that the difficulty of competing in markets in the American continent is already being felt. Possibly, therefore, despite the disconcerting drop in December, the figures for British exports will continue to be favourable for a few months to come. But we can feel no assured confidence that our export trade recovery will be sustained over a longer period, if the present depreciation of the dollar in terms of sterling is maintained, and still less if the depreciation is carried further.33. There is, moreover, another danger latent in the situation besides that of the actual transference of a certain amount of export trade from Great Britain and other countries to the United States. If the depreciation of the dollar were to be carried much further, &quot;the possibility would have to be taken into account that buyers throughout the world might postpone their purchases in the expectation of lower prices. It is conceivable that in this way a new deflationary tendency might be set in motion outside the United States. Such a result would be a by no means unnatural consequence of forcing down a currency so important as the dollar to a level far below its true equilibrium in relation to other currencies. -;&quot; 34. To sum up, we regard it as vital to distinguish between the depreciation which the dollar underwent up to the time of the adoption of the gold-buying policy, and the depreciation which has since taken place and which might conceivably be carried much further. From the standpoint of the appropriate relationship between different currencies, the former bore the character partly of a correction of an existing over-valuation of the dollar and partly of an adjttst-ment which was appropriate to keep pace with the increase in American costs of
production. It thus entailed no serious disturbance of conditions in world markets, while being of material help to the United States. On the other hand, the depreciation of recent months threatens to give rise to a new and formidable under-valuation of the dollar, capable of seriously disorganising international trading. conditions.35. &quot;We have argued in the foregoing paragraphs on the assumption that the gold-buying policy will succeed in effecting what is manifestly its object,, namely, a depreciation in the gold value of the dollar, as measured by the foreign exchanges, corresponding to the price fixed by the United States Treasury from time to time for its gold purchases. Recently, as has been pointed out in part 1, the exchange rates of the dollar have diverged widely from the rates that would correspond to the official gold price. But this divergence is likely, we fear, to provoke developments which may prove an additional source of international disturbance.36. If the United States Administration were to allow the present divergence to continue, its gold-buying policy would be reduced to a manifest futility. Indeed, inasmuch as the ordinary forces of the exchange market, apart from speculative calculations, would almost certainly bring about a recovery in the dollar, the divergence would probably increase, rather than diminish, if no steps were taken in the near future to correct it. It is probable, therefore, that the administration will shortly take some steps designed to make its official gold price effective. But, in order to do this, it must either buy gold abroad on a really large scale, or, at least, buy foreign currencies, sterling, francs, &amp;c, across the foreign exchanges upon a really large scale, an operation which appears-to be beyond the present&quot; legal powers of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. The adoption of the method of large-scale gold purchases abroad would constitute a new menace to the position of the gold standard countries in Europe, and would renew apprehensions, which latterly have been appreciably calmed, that these countries will shortly find themselves compelled to abandon their gold parities. There is a considerable possibility, therefore, that the American gold-buying policy may entail a phase of renewed monetary uncertainty in Europe, entailing an intensification of trade restrictions, and possibly culminating in general exchange confusion.37. Thus, great anxiety must necessarily attach to the development of the American situation. Serious problems, relating in particular to the conduct of our own exchange policy, are likely to arise. If the depreciation of the dollar were to reach a point which threatened to set back the trade recovery in Great Britain, we might be obliged to protect our interests by effecting a further depreciation in the gold value of the pound. Such action on our part is not to be lightly undertaken, since it would probably have the effect of making the position of the gold standard countries insupportable.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, January 10, 1934.o
