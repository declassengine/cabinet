InS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). B C R B T.,P.  24 (34). COPY NO.    V-CABINET.PRESS REQUESTS FOR COPIES OF ANSWERS TO PARLIAMENTARY &quot;QUEST!ONG.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Last December some of my colleagues referred to certain difficulties that had arisen in view of requests made by the press for copies of answers to Parliamentary Questions.      It appeared that there was some discrepancy in the practice of departments in this matter.    I asked Sir Warren Fisher to look into it and I attach a note by him explaining the present position and making certain recommendations.      If my colleagues agree I suggest that it would be for the convenience of all Ministers and their departments if a uniform system were adopted on the lines and by the method indicated in Sir Warren Fisher&apos;s note.(Intld.)    N.C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.25th January, 1954.
I have heen instructed by the Cabinet to investigate the system under which copies of the Replies to Questions in the House of Commons are supplied to the Press, and to see whether a more uniform system can be adopted by all the Departments,      My enquiries show that in the main the present system has worked and is working well.      It was brought into being years ago when most of the principal London,  and some of the larger provincial, papers each had.a gallery corps of reporters.      Copies of the Replies of Ministers to all important Questions were then supplied in order to assist them in the compilation of the long reports of parliamentary proceedings which then appeared,,    At the present moment the only paper which goes to the expense of maintaining a full gallery corps of reporters is The Times, and the old privilege should still be accorded that paper,,      Most of the other papers rely upon the News Agencies for their Parliamentary reports,  supplemented by the articles of their Parliamentary sketch writers.      Copies of the Replies to Questions are therefore now sent in the case of the Prime Minister to:-la The Member who asks the Question.2o The Official Reporter.3c The Reporters&apos; Gallery.4. The TimeSo5 a Reuters.60 Press Association.7. Central News.In the case of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to:-1. The Member who asks the Question.2. The Official Reporter.3d The Reporters&apos; Gallery.43 Press Association.5. Reuters.6 . The Time s.7U The Foreign Office.Every paper of any standing receives a complete service from one Agency and most of them receive the services of all three.The present enquiry has resulted from an application on the part of the Daily Express to be supplied with copies for its own use.    Although not mentioned by this paper, the reason is that in the case of its purely Scottish edition published in Glasgow it has recently sought to obtain additional circulation by-1-
publishing Parliamentary Questions and Answers which have,  or appear to have, any local interest.    At the present moment the Daily Express can obtain from the Secretary of the Press Gallery access to a copy of any Question and Answer;, but,  if its request for a special copy were complied with, we should at once be met with a demand from every Scottish and provincial paper for similar treatment.    Every sketch writer in the gallery, whether representing a London or a provincial paper, would also ask for a copy.    As there is an average certainly of not less than 70 Questions per day, and as about 50 copies of the Answers and Questions would be asked for, Departments would be faced with the task of producing   over 3,000 sheets of typed matter every day the House was in session.      This would necessitate additional staff both for production and distribiition, for it is obviously impossible for the existing staff in most of the Departments to cope with this additional work.      In the case of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, for example, each has two days for Questions in each week, and any extension therefore of their present list would be completely impossible without an increase of the Treasury Establishment.I find that in some Departments the list is slightly larger,  due to the fact that copies are still supplied to papers which received them years ago.    I think it would be advisable in these cases to reduce the list to the length and character of the Prime Minister&apos;s or the Chancellor&apos;s list because  the existence of the privilege to the few outside papers makes it difficult to refuse in other cases.    There is no paper on these lists which does not receive the information from the Agencies,  or whose representative could not see the oopy sent to the Secretary of the Press Gallery.    I suggest that Mr.  Steward be asked to see the newspaper representatives concerned and tactfully explain the situation with a view to the abolition of the preferential treatment.(Intld.)   N.P.W.P.
