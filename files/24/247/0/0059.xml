THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 59 (34).CABINET.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum, prepared in collaboration with the Air Ministry, in regard to the offer to Messrs. Armstrong-Siddeley by the A.E.G. (which is understood to be acting as the agent of the German Government in this matter) of further orders for aeroplane engines.I understand that the Air Ministry desire that no obstacle should be placed in the way of Messrs. Armstrong-Siddeley accepting this offer. The Air Ministry have, however, consulted the Foreign Office; but, in view of the considerations set forth below, and in particular of the extensive character of the new orders, I have felt great hesitation in signifying a purely departmental concurrence, without giving my colleagues an opportunity of further considering the matter.J. S.February 23, 1934.The Sale of Armstrong-Siddeley Aero-Engines to Germany.I. Historical Summary.ON the 15th July, 1933, General Goring asked His Majesty&apos;s Government for permission to buy in this country 25-50 British aircraft for police purposes.On the 24th July, Berlin Embassy informed the German Government that British aircraft could not be sold to the German Government for police purposes forbidden by the Paris Air Agreement of 1926.On the 28th July, the Cabinet decided (Cabinet Conclusions No. 49 (33) of the 28th July, 1933, Conclusion 4), as the result of a request from Messrs. Armstrong-Siddeley to sell manufacturing rights to a German firm, that (1) the Governments concerned should be invited to request their aircraft and engine manufacturers not to sell any aircraft or engines to the German Government direct, or to any German military or public authority, without a written assurance from the German Government that the material would not bemused for any purpose contrary to the Paris Air Agreement. Such action by His Majesty&apos;s Government would be subject to corresponding action by the other Governments;(2) that, meanwhile, no restriction should be placed on such sales by British manufacturers; -.(3) that Armstrong-Siddeley should be allowed to negotiate for the sale to A.E.G. of manufacturing rights above-mentioned.I The Governments approached all replied that they were prepared in principle . to: take the action suggested, except the United States Government, which declined to. accept the condition of a wiutten assurance; but it was finally decided that : their attitude was sufficiently satisfactory for the matter to be pressed no further with them.7278   [9702]
On the 10th November the Governments concerned were informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom now proposed themselves to take the action suggested. They understood that the other Governments would act similarly, but asked for immediate confirmation. The Governments, with the exception of Italy, replied that they were taking, or ready to take, the action desired. The Italians have, it is understood, decided to follow the American example, and, pending the receipt of their reply, the arrangement is not being applied so far as the United Kingdom are concerned.In August Sir John Siddeley visited Germany, where he saw Herr Hitler and General Goring (on this occasion he improperly communicated to the latter confidential information which he had received from the Air Ministry). Following this visit, Messrs. Armstrong-Siddeley received an order for 82 Panther engines from the A.E.G. This order is, it is understood, now in process of completion. Sir J. Siddeley visited Berlin again early in December; and on the 23rd January the Air Ministry informed the Foreign Office that an offer for a further order for 118 Panther engines had been received by Sir J. Siddeley, to be followed, in all probability, by a yet further order for 260 engines.The question for decision is whether an attempt should be made to veto these last orders or not.II. Statement of Reasons For and Against Intervention by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.A gainst.(a) There is no reason why, on legal or technical grounds, these engines should not be sold to the A.EG.(i) The engines are not on the Air Ministry&apos;s &quot; secret list,&quot; i.e., they are not classed as material which, for service reasons, the Air Ministry do not wish other Governments to possess.(ii) Such sale would conform with the Cabinet decision of the 28th July, upon which the sale of the first 82 engines was accepted by the Air Ministry, and would not be contrary to the self-denying arrangement which we proposed to the other Governments concerned last August (even were that arrangement being applied, which is not the case), since the engines are not being sold to the German Govern-ment or to a German Government Department.(iii) Assent has already been given to the sale of the above-mentioned 82 engines, and the further orders can, therefore, be regarded as no more than an extension of an accepted principle.(b) Intervention to forbid the execution of the orders might not be successful. The sale is in no sense illegal in itself, and the arrangement whereby aeronautical firms in this country consult the Air Ministry about foreign orders is only a &quot; gentleman&apos;s arrangement,&quot; and is not in the nature of a binding agreement. There are no legal means by which a governmental veto on the new orders can, in existing circumstances, be enforced. Although the Air Ministry could bring considerable pressure to bear on Messrs. Armstrong-Siddeley, they would be most reluctant to do so, particularly as the firm is suffering from a shortage of orders from the Department at the present time.(c) If the Germans are prevented from buying these engines in this country, they may proceed to transfer their custom to some rival aeronautical firm in, for instance, the United States, France or Italy.For.The objections which can be advanced against the sale are of a purely political character.(1) The first order for eighty-two engines having now been followed up by the offer of a second order for 118, with the probability of a third order for 260 engines, the whole transaction may be held to be rather suspicious, in view of the personal contacts which Sir J. Siddeley has established with Herr Hitler and General Goring on his recent visits to-Germany. There is little doubt that the German Chancellor is personally interested in these orders, and he is known to have suggested that Sir John Siddeley should convey a message to the Secretary
February 23, 1934.of State for Foreign Affairs on the matter. The Foreign Office declined, however, to receive this message.(2) Though there may be a genuine civil requirement for a number of these engines, the majority are almost certainly meant for the use of the air fleet which the German Government is determined to build up, for the A.E.G. is known to be the agent of the German Government in its dealings with the Armstrong-Siddeley group of aeronautical concerns. It might be difficult to explain, if the transaction-tions are allowed to go forward and eventually become known publicly, the action of His Majesty&apos;s Government in conniving, for whatever reasons, at the partici-pation of the British aircraft industry in the building up of a type of air fleet which Germany is forbidden by the Peace Treaties to possess.(3) Once this trade is allowed to start, vested interests may grow up, and it will become increasingly difficult to stop without causing considerable loss and hardship to British manufacturers at a later date.(4) There is the danger that the German Government may at some subsequent period find it convenient to try to exploit the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government made no difficulty in allowing the export of aeronautical material to Germany which, they should have known, was intended for an illegal German military force.(5) In fact, it is quite possible that the whole thing is a trap intended to involve His Majesty&apos;s Government and the British aeronautical industry, and that it is not really necessary for the German Government to have these particular British engines rather than any others. On this assumption, it is conceivable that, if the German Government fail in their effort to buy these engines here, they will not attempt to obtain similar engines from some other foreign country, but will proceed to manufacture them themselves.
