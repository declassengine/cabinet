THIS DOCUMENT IS TIIE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S QOVESBHMBWT, SECRET.Q.P. 86 (84). COPY NO.      - &apos;CABINET.Anglo-Soviet Trade Negotiations.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade,.My memorandum CP. 267(33) showed that the Russians had agreed to include in the proposed new agreement two important provisions which did not appear in the 1930 agreement.   These provisions (which involved concessions to us representing a departure on cardinal points from the commercial policy hitherto followed &quot;by the Soviet) relate to:-(a) a modification of most-favoured-nation treatment for russian goods designed to leave us free to carry out our obligations under Article 21 of our Ottawa Agreement with Canada; and(b) a balance of payments scheme under which the Russiansundertake (after an initial period for the change over from the existing position) to spend here approximately the same amount as they receive for their sales to us. There was disagreement between the two sides as to the period to be allowed for negotiation and notice of a complaint under provision (a) and the putting into force of prohibitive measures against the defendant party&apos;s goods.   The Russians wanted five months; my colleagues thought (Cab. Con 62(33)3) that we should offer three months only.   The Russians have now conceded this point.The Cabinet also agreed that we should try to obtain further concessions on four other points relating to (l) shipping (2) herrings, (3) the treatment of our diplomatic and consular officials in Russia,, notably in the matter of supplies of food-
-0-stuffs, and (4) the Lena -Qoldfljeldjs- Company^ olainu-  jPoJjrt^ (3) and (4) ape--re-ally extraneous, hut it was thought worth while to use tho trade negotiations as a lever to obtain assurances which we had been unable to get by means of diplomatic representations.The Russians are willing to declare in a letter their intention of using an increased proportion of British ships so long as the charter rates are not raised against them.   As regards herrings, the Soviet Trade Representative in London has stated that while no written undertaking can be given at present the importance of Sovie-t Purchases to the British herring industry is fully appreoiated, and that he expects to be able to purchase substantial quantities of herrings after the conclusion of a trade agreement.    Having regard to the concessions already made by the Russians, and to the opportunities provided for our industries, including the shipping and herring Industries, in the balance of payments scheme, I am content to accept the offers as regards herrings and shipping - the only two outstanding &quot;trade&quot; points.We have not succeeded, by connecting the question of treatment of our representatives in Russia with the trade negotiations, in inducing the Soviet Government to give the hoped for assurances in respect of supplies of foodstuffs. H.M. Ambassador at Moscow has therefore been instructed to inform the Soviet Government that we feel it necessary to place it on record that we cannot admit liability to pay duty on past cr future imports of necessities for H.M. Embassy or Consulates In the Soviet Union and that, if the present arrangements for adequate provision of such goods were seriously modified to the disadvantage of our reprssentatives^ we should have no alternative but to withdraw the Ambassador.As to the Lena Goldfields claim, the Soviet Government have been informed that, in view of M. Litvinov&apos;s statement that the Soviet Concessions Committee would r*i&amp;coduct favourably
to an offer by the Company to resume negotiations and that such resumption would indicate a mutual amendment of terms,   H.M. Government will advise the Company to inform the Concessions Committee that they propose to send representatives immediately to Moscow on the understanding that their own terms will now be materially reduced, and the Committee&apos;s last offer materially increased.   M. Litvinov, having consulted the Concessions Committee^assented to this arrangement.    The Lena Company have been notified accordingly and have intimated their willingness to send a representative to Moscow to negotiate with the Concessions Committee.Unless^ therefore, we are held up by the Russians^who do not like what we propose to do about timber, I think we should now conclude the agreement on the lines which I have indicated.W.R.oard of Trade,26th January, 1934.
