THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1934.SECRET. Copy No.     40OP. 2 (34).CABINET.THE SITUATION IN PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the. Colonies.I SHALL be glad if my colleagues will read the following letter which T have received from the High Commissioner for Palestine.(Initialled) P. C.-L.Downing Street, January 2, 1934.Annex.Private and Personal Letter from the High Commissioner for Palestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated December 18, 1933.Government, House, My dear Philip, Jerusalem, December 18, 1933.THE Arabs have declared their intention to hold general demonstrations about the 16th January on the feast of Bairam, which is held on the first day after Ramadan.Since the disturbances of last October feeling in the country has become more bitter; consequently the liability to further riots is greater, since instead of a reasonable measure of goodwill there is now a general feeling of hostility, and crowds are even more readily swayed than formerly because of the hostile feeling against the police, due in great measure to the loss of life from gun-fire, in Jaffa and Jerusalem.At no time did I consider the recent disorders very serious as a threat to the State for three main reasons : First, because their character was purely political; second, because the fellaheen did not join in the riots; and third, because the leaders showed no powers of organisation.It would be folly to count on these conditions lasting. The demonstrations this year have been political in character and definitely anti-British because the British policy is to adhere to the policy of the Balfour Declaration and the Prime Ministers letter to Dr. Weismann. If demonstrations take place on Bairam, which is a religious festival, and rioters are shot, religious feelings will be strongly excited. Should religious as well as political cries be raised, a number of the fellaheen;, many of whom are landless and many very poor, will join; after their recent experiences it is probable that in future the leaders will attempt to arrange for outbreaks to take place simultaneously in different places, fire-arms may be freely used and communications cut. Our difficulties therefore are liable to be far more formidable in the future than they have been in the past.Consequently if no change takes place, we must be prepared to face more serious disturbances, if not in mid-January then at some later date, than anything that took place this autumn.Even so I remain confident we shall suppress any riots that may occur, but it seems to me possible that the number of killed and wounded on both sides may greatly exceed the casualties that occurred this year.[9473] b
The riot in Tel Aviv on the 9th December was not important. It was confined to Revisionists and denounced by Dizengoff and the Municipality. D nfortunately the stone-throwers inflicted a number of casualties on our police, who at first were few in numbers.&quot; There&apos;s some say we won. And some say they won, But I say nane won at a&apos;, man.&quot;But all Jews hate, as much as Arabs approve, the. principle of deportation of illicit Jewish immigration.. It will be understood from the above remarks that, much as I deplore bloodshed, and fully as I appreciate the disastrous effects of serious riots on the minds of the people and the general diminution of the sense of security of life and property in Palestine, I am not alarmed as to our ability to maintain order, though possibly only after action by the military as well as by the police.It is not the present, but the future, that chiefly concerns me, and it is equally my duty to express my views on the future as on the present situation.It does not seem possible to me that the present hostility and widening breach between the Arabs and the British rulers can remain as they are to-day; either we find means to bring ruler and ruled more in sympathy, or the separation and hostility will grow deeper and more permanent each year.Consequently, it is not &apos;only our duty, but our interest, to explore every means to bring about some form of reconciliation and so prevent the present discontent from becoming permanent and more widespread.There are three main influences which bear on the Arab mind : (a) Religious. (6) Political. (c) Economic.(a) The riots of 1929 (and those of 1920 and 1921) were due to fears that Jewish settlement threatened Arab security from a religious, political and economic standpoint.This autumn the religious cry was not raised, because the fear of any threat, direct or indirect, on their religion is dormant, though not dead. This is an extremely important step in advance, because riots would double both in number and in intensity were they backed by religious leaders and supported in the mind of the fellaheen by the belief that their religion was threatened. This satis-factory position is due mainly to the agreement Government made last year with the Supreme Moslem Council and to my own (at present) most happy relations with the Mufti and other members of the Supreme Moslem Council.(b) The political hostility towards Government is due to three main causes : (i) The growing hatred of the institution of the Jewish National Home as its results are, each few years, more clearly seen.   The fear that as the years pass, not only the lands, but the Arab people of Palestine, will be more and more dominated by the Jewish invaders, (ii) The growth of national feeling in Palestine and other Arab countrieswhich causes any foreign rule to grow more and more distasteful, (iii) The action of political leaders, who, for their own political existence, are bound to outvie each other in denunciation of a foreign Govern-ment which supports the Balfour Declaration.(c) The economic situation in Palestine is at present, from the ordinary point of view, so satisfactory, it may seem strange that the majority of Arabs should regard it as a cause of widespread dissatisfaction against Government, especially among the fellaheen.It would be foolish, however, to ignore this attitude. Educated Arabs admit that Palestine as a whole gains economically from the entry of Jews and Jewish capital, but they argue that this gain is temporary and local.   It is of advantage,
they admit, to those individuals who sell their lands to the Jews, but this process has three evils : (i) It replaces a landlord who employed the cultivators of the soil by a landlord who refuses all employment to Arabs. &apos;(ii) It reduces the amount of available land, already small enough, to meetthe needs of the normal increase of the Arab population, (iii) It increases the numbers of landless Arabs, and of unemployed Arabs.In.this connexion I enclose a Report on Unemployment in Palestine.These three evils exist. They are mitigated by the fact that a certain number of Arabs gain employment from Jews, and that by improvements in agricultural methods the land can be made to support a larger number of families. You know the efforts Government has made in this direction the last two years, but the process is necessarily a slow one.These cannot be ended so long as we adhere to our present interpretation of the Balfour Declaration, for a large number of immigrants must be admitted on the basis of the absorptive capacity of the country, so long as the country generally is prospering and developing as it is to-day.But there is an important distinction to bear in mind as to this prosperity : the immigration of Jews, though of economic benefit to the country as a whole, is not of benefit to many Arabs. None the less, these evils cannot be suddenly ended as the Mufti would wish, and before a change of policy would be justified we are in need of more facts, and the formation of a Statistical Bureau will help to that end.For these evils no swift or radical remedy exists. Startling measures are recommended by both Arab and Jew, but I feel that dramatic action is not what is called for in Palestine. In fact, my chief differences with the more sensible leaders of both parties are not so much of principle as of pace. I believe the aims and interests of the two races are reconcilable, but I fear at present leaders on both sides lack either sufficient political wisdom or authority to adopt a policy that will effect a reconciliation in the near future.Government must therefore continue to perform its double duty under the Mandate. The record during the past years shows that Government has done much to facilitate the National Home, and something to mitigate the poverty of the fellah and improve his conditions of health, his chances of education and his methods of agriculture. Government has not yet fulfilled its pledge to establish a Legislative Council, but this I hope to do in accordance with my statement made with your approval at Geneva last year. Such a Council will at least give all classes a means of expressing their views and grievances and lessen the temptation to adopt unconstitutional methods. The establishment of this Council may not restore Arab confidence in the British Government, but failure to give some form of local self-government at an early date will certainly increase and perpetuate the present mistrust.Further disturbances and bloodshed will make this policy all the more difficult of fulfilment. For that and other reasons I am now considering under what conditions manifestations of public feeling can safely be given expression in the various towns of Palestine. These conditions will naturally vary from place to place. If there is definite evidence of an intention to organise processions or assemblies, I shall encourage, and I hope induce, the moderate elements to apply for prior permission. Permission would only be given under conditions designed to minimise the danger of disorder. If permission is not applied for, Government will be in a very much stronger moral position for dealing with any subsequent disturbances which may result.Two other measures, I hope, may be of good effect, though neither can be achieved in the twinkling of an eye.When vacancies occur in administrative or executive posts of Government service, I hope with more success in the future than in the past to consider the possibility of finding capable Palestinians of good character to fill such positions.Unless we were to declare &quot;that in view, of the changed conditions of to-day with those of 1923, the present form of the Balfour Declaration should be reconsidered, I do not see that any change can be made in the principles of our immigration policy. But when the Statistical Bureau has been in working order for some months, I trust with more facts and figures at our disposal, I shall be able[9473] b 2
to give more convincing reasons for the numbers allowed under the Labour Schedule. But so long as illicit immigration continues Arabs can fairly claim that immigration is unregulated and unfair in its working.The political state of the country is not satisfactory any more than is the economic state of the fellaheeri, but both are due to specific factors which cannot be suddenly changed:My endeavour is to lessen the tension of political feeling by the policy indicated above, just as I hoped to improve the condition of the fellah by the slow but sure means of education, mainly technical and agricultural development.Arab leaders may be desperate, but I doubt their power to persuade the mass of the people to join in general disturbances in defiance of Government, unless the Mufti told them their religion was at stake.I believe both Arab and Jew realise that whatever laws are passed they will be upheld, and though I am ever ready to listen to the voice of reason, I shall not be influenced by the threat of force.Yours verv sincerely,ARTHUR WAUCHOPE.. Enclosure. .Memorandum on Conditions of Employment in Palestine at the end ofOctober 1933.THE improvement in the labour situation of Palestine noticeable at the end of September last has continued throughout the month of October, with the exception of the last five days of the month, during which Arab activities in trade and industry were partly suspended for political reasons. The capital brought in by recent immigrants is having an unmistakable influence on the building and plantation trades.2. Agriculture among Arabs showed an improvement as a result of the com-mencement of the orange season.In the orange districts the cultivation by Jews and Arabs of new groves continues unabated. Shortage of Jewish hands for this and other agricultural work has led to the increased employment by Jewish growers of Arab workers. About 5,000 Arab labourers are said to be employed by Jews in the orange growing district.Other seasonal agricultural and related activities which provide Arab agricultural labourers with employment, include olive picking in which women are engaged, woodcutting and charcoal-making, in the Jenin, Safad, Acre, Haifa, Ramallah, Gaza, Nablus and Jerusalem sub-districts.In the grain-growing districts, ploughing and the sowing of &quot; afir &quot; comprise the seasonal activities, which provide employment for the greater part of the agricultural labourers. In certain parts of these districts, which have suffered from the drought of the past summer, the issue by local authorities of seed loans, and the provision of relief works, have been responsible for the alleviation of distress from which the population had been suffering. Public works have given an appreciable relief in the Safad, Baisan, Nazareth and Tiberias sub-districts.These activities, together with a noticeable development in orange plantation in the entire length of the coastal plain, have had their due effect on the figures of agricultural unemployment. There are no Jewish agriculturists without employment, while the number of Arab agriculturists unemployed has fallen by almost 2,000 in a month. At the same time, the movement of Arab workers from the country districts to the towns has ceased, and an appreciable number of workers have returned to their villages. This, together with the departure of a number of Trans-Jordanians, has led to a scarcity of labour in the towns, especially in the Port of Jaffa.3. There has been a definite moderation of the movement into Palestine of Trans-Jordanians in search of work, to which attention has previously been drawn, and a number of these men have returned to their homes.4. Building activities, especially among Jews in Haifa and Tel Aviv, continues high, and the scarcity of skilled building workers has led to a rise in
wages. Another result has been the increased employment by Jewish contractors of Arab building workers. Attracted by the rise in wages, Jewish skilled workers are still proceeding to Haifa and, to a less extent, to Tel Aviv.Building operations are expanding in the Jewish villages of the orange districts, as a consequence of the influx of new settlers. In the Jewish villages and settlements of the grain-growing districts, particularly in the Emek or Vale of Jezreel, building activities are, however, slack.The Arab Building Trade is well maintained in Jaffa, Ramleh, Gaza, Acre, Haifa, Jerusalem and Tiberias.   Elsewhere, slackness is experienced.5. Greater activity is reported in the Jewish and Arab textile trades. Jewish textile factories are working full time, some of them in two and even three shifts.Arab weaving in Majdal is progressing satisfactorily. A Union of Arab weavers has been formed in this town, the first trade union in its history.Seasonal increase in activity is observable in the Boot and Shoe and Clothing-trades, with the approach of winter. Unemployment among Jews and Arabs in these trades does not exist, with the exception of- Jewish dressmakers, among whom unemployment is increasing. Unemployment among Jewish women is becoming a problem, and is undoubtedly larger than the figures given at the end of this memorandum suggest.Employment among wood workers is also expanding, and there is practically no unemployment there, one of the principal causes being the great demand in connection with the manufacture of orange boxes.Unemployment is increasing among the Arab tanners of Jaffa and Hebron, while Arab and Jewish tanning activities in Ramleh and Tel Aviv-Benei Beraq respectively are stationary. Nine tanneries have recently been closed in Jaffa, where there are about a hundred men of this trade out of work.6. It is estimated that at the end of October 1933 apart from men who were on strike for political reasons there were about 17,000 Arabs (including 600 women), and at least 1,000 Jews (including 600 women), in need of and seeking employment. Of the Arabs, about 9,000 were agricultural workers, and about 3,600 general unskilled labourers. The remaining 4,400 claimed to be members of skilled trades. Unemplojmient is relatively high among Arabs in Nablus, Hebron, Tulkarm and Nazareth districts.The Jewish women, who probably exceed 600, are practically all dressmakers, clerks, typists and shop assistants. The Jewish unemployed concentrate in Tel Aviv.The comparative figures of unemployed for the months of September 1933 and October 1932 were as follows : Jews October 1933 : 1,000 (of whom 600 were women). September 1933 :  1,000 (of whom 625 were women). October 1932 : 1,120 (of whom 400 were women).Arabs October 1933 :  17,000 (including 600 women). September 1933 : 18,000 (including 500 women). October 1932 :  14,000 (including 325 women).
