[This document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1934..1/ LSECRETCP. 40 (34). Copy NoCABINET.Policy in regard to Afghanistan.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.In paragraph 6 of the memorandum dated 2nd February by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and myself, reference is made to a recommendation by the Government of India that His Majesty&apos;s Government should most seriously consider the question whether, if they reach I he conclusion that military aggression by Russia on Afghanistan would in the last resort inevitably lead to military support of Afghanistan, it would not be advisable to inform the Afghan Government accordingly. Appendix 2 to that Memorandum quotes an extract from a telegram dated 25th November 1933, from the Government of India, in which they indicated their reasons for this recommendation.I have received a Despatch, dated 4th January 1934, from the Government of India, which has been under preliminary consideration in my Department, containing a more detailed exposition of their reasons for their recommendation, and circulate copy of this Despatch for the information of my colleagues.The Government of India&apos;s recommendation raises a question of the first importance which will require detailed and careful consideration. The arguments in favour of the course which they recommend are clearly stated in their Despatch. On the other hand, these arguments have to be weighed against certain obvious difficulties in entering into a commitment to the Afghan Government of the kind which they recommend. The best course will, I think, be to refer this question to the Defence of India Committee when the other matters referred to in paragraph 5 of the joint memorandum of 2nd February come before it. If this procedure is adopted, I should propose in due course to submit to that Committee the considerations on either side of the question which appear to me to be relevant to its discussion.S. H.9th February 1934.Government of India Despatch No. 1, Foreign and Political Department,dated 4th January 1934.Attitude of the Government of India towards Russian aggression against Afghanistan.Sir,We have the honour to refer to our telegram No. 2783, dated the 25th November 1933, in which we recommended that His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt a certain attitude towards recent requests put forward by the Afghan Government. In the concluding paragraph of that telegram we indicated our intention of sending by Despatch a more detailed exposition of our reasons for recommending that the Afghan Government should be informed confidentially of our intention to support them against military aggression by the Soviet, and this communication is sent in fulfilment of that intention.2. We wish, in the first place, to make it clear that we do not desire any public announcement to be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to any further assurances which they may decide to give to .the Afghan Government.   As you will no doubt recollect, His Majesty&apos;s Government Vide despateh from foreign Office to His   decided as recently as December 1932 that it was Manesty s Minister, Kabul, No. 100, dated ,    .    n J . ...the 1st December 1932. undesirable to make a public  announcementregarding the very guarded assurances given by His Majesty&apos;s Minister to the Afghan Foreign Minister in July 1931, because they considered that such an announcement was superfluous and calculated to increase the existing friction in the relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government with&apos; the Soviet Government. The same objection, no doubt, applies to the more explicit and definite assurances which it is now proposed to give, although it might be argued that such an announcement would serve to prevent the Soviet from under-2567      100   2.34 A
talcing an adventure in which, they would have: to reckon on armed resistance from Afghanistan supported by the British Empire. There appears, however, to us to be a more cogent objection arising out of the manner in which such an announcement could and no doubt would be utilised by the enemies of the present regime in Afghanistan. The whole, history of King Nadir Shah&apos;s reign has been remarkable for the difficulty experienced by the Afghan Government in maintaining a friendly attitude towards His Majesty&apos;s Government without incurring the opprobrium of being the subservient creature of that Government. It is, we think, obvious that a public declaration of the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to support the Afghan Government if they were attacked by Russia would be represented by the pro-Amanullah party and other disaffected Afghan parties as meaning that the Afghan Government had consented to sell their country to the British, who would defend it from Russia for their own advantage. Such propaganda&apos; would, we consider, be extremely damaging it&apos;not fatal to the present Government in Afghanistan and it-seems in the last degree improbable that they would themselves be prepared to incur such a risk.3. We have briefly indicated in our telegram No. 2783 the arguments which have led us to recommend to His Majesty&apos;s Government that more definite assurances -should now be given by His Majesty&apos;s Minister to the Afghan Government, but we feel that these arguments need to be more fully developed before we can hope for acceptance of our proposal. The first point which we wish to emphasise is how greatly the military and strategic conceptions which have hitherto been accepted with regard to the possibility of military aggression by Russia against India through Afghanistan have altered of late years. Until comparatively recently Russia could only in the then existing state of her internal communications send an expeditionary . force against India by the Kushk-Herat route to Kandahar. This journey could not be -accomplished by a military force of any size in less than a year and that force would be dependent upon a long and vulnerable line of communications. Our military -advisers now point out that the Soviet Government have so developed their railway system that they can now maintain forces along the northern frontier of Afghanistan with all the paraphernalia of war from three distinct bases of operations instead of being confined to a single line of supply via the Caspian and Central Asiatic Railway. Moreover, terminal facilities now provided bear an ominous resemblance to the German railways pointing towards Belgium and France in 1914, and permit of the deployment of those forces on a wdde front. The Soviet Government have also a very large air organisation at Tashkent, and the danger of this arm being-utilised for a rapid offensive both against Kabul and India cannot be overlooked.We have no desire to  question the accuracy Vide Enclosure 1 to Despatch No. 82 of   0f the conclusions reached bv His Majesty&apos;s 17th October 19:32 from His Majesty-s   Government in 1932, when the general con-Secretary ot state tor JBoreisrn, Aftairs to     .... . it ct ci d -i iHis Majesty-s-Minister, KabuL ditions in  the   U.S.S.R. were  examined, andwe are satisfied that at present the Soviet Government neither intend nor are able to take the offensive against Afghanistan and India. But it would be idle to disregard the fact that Russia has the largest army in the world, a very large air force, munition factories and air depots on a large scale -and inexhaustible man-power. She has also bitter enmity against the British Empire and a very clear idea that the land frontier of India, if it can be reached through Afghanistan, is the one place where she can make effective use of her military strength against a maritime Power. To us, therefore, it seems certain that she will not hesitate, should opportunity arise, to use Afghanistan as Germany used Belgium. But, even if this danger is not now imminent, our immediate pre-occupation is the effect which the facts stated above must have on the minds of those at present responsible for the safety and integrity of Afghanistan. We understand that the Afghan Prime Minister, who has spent several years in Moscow, is deeply imbued with fear and distrust of the Soviet Government. It is clear that these feelings have driven him hitherto to , turn to us for advice and support against Russian threats, but there is the clanger already alluded to in our telegram that, if he can get nothing from His Majesty&apos;s Government but half-hearted phrases hedged about with qualifications and conditions, he will feel compelled to come to terms with the Soviet as the only means of saving his country. This most -dangerous eventuality could, we believe, be prevented, if we assure him now that he can rely on us for military support in circumstances which would, we feel, compel us to give that support, even though we had not committed ourselves beforehand.   That support can, however, only be effective if steps have been taken
in advance to concert measures of defence in co-operation and to improve our communications with Kabul. Unless, therefore, we encourage the Afghans to check the development of their communications with Russia and to co-operate with us in improving our own, the Russians would be able to throw an expeditionary force into Kabul before we could take any effective steps to forestall them. We attach a note by the General Staff on communications in general, which shows the remarkable increase of the communications between Russia and Afghanistan to which we refer. If His Majesty&apos;s Government would consent to give the assurance which we recommend, and military conversations follow, it should be possible to convince the Afghan Government that they must join with us in improving the communi-cations between India and Kabul and encourage them to take a strong line in resisting Russian demands for improvement of communications from the North. It is perhaps hardly necessary to emphasize the fact that good communications between India and Afghanistan would greatly simplify all our problems not only in connection with Russian aggression but also in connection with a possibly hostile Afghanistan and our own tribes.4. The argument stated in the preceding paragraph is mainly based upon larger considerations of Imperial policy, and will, we hope, convince His Majesty&apos;s Government that they can no longer afford to maintain a non-committal attitude towards this problem. We would, however, add that we also anticipate certain more local advantages from the policy which we now advocate. It appears to us that, if the existing Afghan Government are assured of support against Russian aggression, we can reasonably hope that they will continue to give the Government of India friendly co-operation in the problems of our common frontier. On the other hand, failure to give any satisfactory replies to their overtures may well induce them to reconsider their policy towards the tribes and again involve us in great difficulties with the tribes on our own side of the Durand Line, because these latter can count on support against us from a hostile or indifferent Afghan Government.5. In conclusion, we feel it necessary to comment briefly on the objections which will be urged against our proposal.   We are aware that in July 1931 His Majesty&apos;sGovernment after carefully considering the i * Forminka No. 80, dated,the 24th July matter instructed* His Majesty&apos;s Minister to 1931, from, troreign Otnce, London, to His ,.     ,      ,     .P1        ,,      J     J    ,   , i   ,   -Majesty&apos;s Minister, Kabul. explain to the Afghan Government that it was contrary to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to enter into military alliances, also that a secret agreement or understanding ,.with another Power was not only incompatible with the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, but also with their obligations under Article 18 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. It will no doubt be difficult to make an exception to a policy of this kind and even more difficult to give promises to Afghanistan which might be regarded as infringements of our obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations. We observe, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government in paragraph 3 of their telegram No SO, dated the 24th July 1931, in which the above instructions were conveyed, stated that their policy in any contingency that might arise must be guided by their own interests, as well as by provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations. We venture, therefore, to urge that the interests of the Empire are so vitally involved in the adequate defence of India against Russian aggression that it would be extremely unwise to deprive ourselves of any weapon which can assist us in maintaining that defence. To us it seems that while the military commitments of the Empire have been enormously increased not only by mandates, but by actual treaties, such, for instance, as the Locarno Agreement and the treaty with Iraq, His Majesty&apos;s Government should examine most carefully all the conflicting arguments before they decide not to give a confidential assurance that we intend to resist Russian aggression against the buffer State which protects the only laud frontier of the British Empire.6.

Note by the General Staff, India.1. The development of both railway and road communications in Soviet Turkestan during the past six years is of such military importance as to warrant close examination.2. The following paragraphs set forth briefly the course such developments have taken and the effect they are likely to have on the military situation.3. I. . . . Along the Northern Frontier of Afghanistan.4. Railways. (a) The completion of the Turk-Sib (Turkestan-Siberian) railway connects Tashkent and, through Tashkent, the right bank of the Oxus with the Trans-Siberian railway and so with Siberia.This railway taps a fertile grain-producing area with unlimited resources ; it connects Turkestan with the projected munition factories in Siberia; it allows of the transport oE reinforcements from Siberia.(6) The extension of the railway east to Andijau and beyond opens up another fertile area from which supplies can be drawn.(c) The extension of the Kagan-Termez railway to Stalinabad (Dushambe) and thence to Kulab, and the projected extension from Kulab to the Oxus, and from Stalinabad to Kurgan Tapa, allow of deployment on a wide front with three separate railheads, thereby avoiding congestion at Termez.5. It is true that the limitations imposed by the Kagan-Termez section limit the number of divisions which can be maintained in the Oxus area, but according to our information the railway in its present state is capable of maintaining eight divisions. By adding crossing places the capacity of the line could be increased at short notice.C. Roads. (a) The completion of the northern road across the Hindu-Kush via Dare Shikari brings Kabul into direct communication by motor with Mazar-i-Sharif and so with Termez ; and although the road in its present state would not staud up to continuous motor traffic, the fact that a motorable road exists at all is of considerable military significance.(?)) Work is also proceeding on the Tash Kurgan-Khanabad road. The existing tracks from Kunduz to the Oxus at Sarai Kamar and from Khanabad via Rustak to the Oxus south of Kulab could easily be improved to M.T. standard.7. From a military point of view the net result of these developments may be summarized as follows : (a) The Russians could concentrate and could maintain a force of some eightdivisions on the line of the Oxus between Termez and Kulab ; supplies and munitions for this force could be drawn by the Turk-Sib railway from Siberia, by the Orenburg-Tashkent railway from central Russia, and by the Central Asian railway from Southern Russia.(b) This force could deploy along the line of the Oxus on a front of some 150 mileswith three separate railheads.(c) Except for a gap of 12 miles a road fit for M.T. exists from the Oxus atTermez via Mazar-i-Sharif and Haibak to the Hindu-Kush and thence to Kabul via Shikari and Charikar, and subsidiary lines of advance could be developed via Kunduz and Khanabad.8. That the Russians hope to develop these subsidiary lines is indicated by the recent request made by the Soviet Military Attache, who suggested that a new road should be constructed from Haibak to the Oxus and should be linked with the Russian railway system by a bridge over the Oxus. He presumably had in mind a road from Haibak via Kunduz to Sarai Kamar combined with an extension of the Stalinabad-Kurghan Tapa spur to Sarai Kamar.9. A second line of advance against Afghanistan still exists via Kushk Post on Herat. This line has not been developed or improved in any way during the past six years, and although&apos; the railway from Merv to Kushk is still capable of maintaining eight divisions, and the road from Kushk to Herat is capable of taking motor traffic, there is no room for the deployment of a large force, there is only one railhead, and the lead for supplies and munitions from Siberia and from central Russia would be increased.
ii567B10. From Herat there are two linea of advance, one east towards Kabul and the other south towards Kandahar. The former has been considerably improved during the past year, and is now motorable throughout except for a portion of some 75 miles in length in the neighbourhood of Daulatyar.The Herat-Kandahar road, although used by a fairly regular lorry service, has had little or nothing done to it for some years, is deficient of bridges over several important watercourses, and contains long stretches of sand and &quot; put &quot; which would not stand up to continuous traffic without metalling.   Water is scarce.11. The above description of the rail and road facilities which now exist on the two lines of advance from Soviet territory into Afghanistan shows that both for purposes of the initial concentration and of the subsequent maintenance of the field forces, the dice are heavily loaded in favour of an advance from the direction of the Oxus.   If that is conceded it follows that such advance will be directed on Kabul.II. Along the frontier of India.12. There are at present only two lines of advance from India into Afghanistan which are practicable for a modern army, namely, the northern line via the Khyber, and Jalalabad to Kabul, and the western line from Chaman to Kandahar, and thence to Kabul and Herat.13. Railhead on the northern line is at Landi Khana.The existing road from Landi Khana to Kabul, though used by lorries, would not stand up in its present state to continuous M.T. traffic. It requires re-making and in places re-alignment.14. Railhead on the western line is at Chaman. The existing road from Chaman to Kandahar is an unmetalled track traversing a practically waterless area. It is in use by lorries, but 60 per cent, of its length is soft &quot; put,&quot; which cuts up badly under M.T. traffic and is impassable after rain. The road requires metalling to make it fit for continuous traffic.15. Fro a Knndahar there are two further lines of advance, one west to Herat, and one north fco Kabul.The Herat road is unmetalled, and although used by lorries, has had little or nothing done to,it for some years. It is deficient of bridges over several important rivers and contains long stretches of sand and &quot; put &quot; which would not stand up to continuous traffic without metalling. The reconstruction of the road would be a slow process, owing to the absence of suitable stone for road metal and the many waterless stretches.The road from Kandahar to Kabul is unmetalled, except for the section of 91 miles between Ghazni and Kabul. It is in use by lorries but would not stand up to continuous M.T. traffic in its present state. Numerous bridges existed at one time, but practically all of them have been destroyed or become useless through neglect.Our conclusion, therefore, is (a) that whereas in 1927 communications practically restricted offensive operations by Russia to the western line via Kushk and Herat on Kandahar, to-day communications not only favour but will impel Russia to select the northern line for such operations, and that her primary objective in future will be Kabul rather than Kandahar. Such change of plan need, however, in no way prejudice a subsidiary advance via Kushk on Herat. Any subsequent advance from that place is more likely to be in an easterly direction towards Kabul than in a southerly direction towards Kandahar.(6) That if road and railway communications in Soviet Russia and in the Northern Provinces of Afghanistan continue to develop at the rate they have developed during the past seven years, without some corresponding improvement in the roads connecting Kabul with India, we may find the Russians in an even more favourable military position vis-a-vis Kabul than we are ourselves.
