Memorandum by Minister of Health .The Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer of the Ministry of Health for 1932 included a survey of theeffects of the continued unemployment on national health.-The general result was that there was no medical evidence available of any general increase in physical impairment in sickness or in mortality as the result of economic depression or unemployment.The survey was in respect of the year 1932. I think it is desirable to make some special inquiry into the position up-to-date, and I have discussed the matter with the President of the Board of Education from the point of view of the children of school age.We are agreed that we should assign suitable officers of the two Ministries to make a joint local inquiry on the spot into present conditions in the most distressed areas. Ytfe have at present in mind the South Wales Coalfield, the Worth-Eastern Area and certain selected parts of Lancashire .We propose that the inquiry should be set on foot forthwith and that a suitable announcement should be made in the House of Commons in answer to an agreed Question.(Intld.)    TS.H.Y.23rd February, 193-i.
