S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT) .C A: B I N E T.PAY-BEDS IN VOLUNTARY HOSPITALS. MEMORANDUM BY THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL.1.&apos;    This Memorandum is submitted in order to obtain the approval of the Cabinet to the introduction into Parliament of a Bill authorising voluntary hospitals, with the authority of the Charity Commissioners, to set aside beds for patients who are prepared to pay for the accommodation provided. 2.     At the present time many voluntary hospitals are by the terms of the trusts under which they are established prevented from providing hospital facilities in return for payment.      At the same time, recent advances in medicine and surgery have necessitated greatly increased expenditure by hospitals, while there has been a marked decline in charitable donations.      These two factors have placed the voluntary hospitals in a position of great difficulty.      In some cases they have curtailed their accommodation;    in other cases, notwithstanding the probability that such action is a breach of the truats upon which the property of the hospitals is held, they have in fact contracted with patients, local authorities, workmen&apos;s and employerfs hospital associations and the like bodies to provide treatment in return for specified charges.3-      During the last Session of Parliament certain voluntary hospitals &quot;promoted Private Bills giving them powers to set aside such beds.      In accordance with my duties I reportedE CR E T..P.  29 (54).
upon these proposals as affecting the charitable trusts of the hospitals concerned.      The Bills were in due course passed, and I understand that other hospitals are seeking similar powers this Session.      It is undesirable, in my opinion, that hospitals should be put to the great expense of Private Bill legislation unless it is absolutely necessary, and it seems to me better to deal with the matter by a General Act conferring on the voluntary hospitals the necessary powers, with proper safe-guards.      The necessary Bill would, I think, be quite short and would authorise hospitals, notwithstanding the trusts upon which the property and funds of the hospitals are held, to maintain such number of beds and for such period as the Charity Commissioners may from time to time authorise for the reception and treatment of patients who are able and willing to pay the charges to be specified by the Commissioners. 4.      I have had the opportunity of discussing the matter with the Minister of Health and I understand that he entirely supports the proposals put forward in this Memorandum.      I also am informed that the King Edward VII Hospital Fund, the British Hospitals Association and the British Medical Association support the general principles involved.(intld)    T.W.H.I.LAW OFFICERS1  DEPARTMENT. 29th January, 1934.
