Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1934.SECRET. Copy No. 44CP: 52 (34).CABINET.BETTING AND LOTTERIES BILL.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.IN pursuance of the decision of the Cabinet taken on the 16th January, 1934 (Cabinet Conclusions 1 (34), Conclusion 7), / circulate for the consideration of h tj* &amp;w jay colleagues the attached draft of a Bill dealing with betting on the course (including the legalisation, subject to restrictions, of totalisator betting on greyhound tracks), lotteries (including competitions), and certain amendments of the Racecourse Betting Act, 1928, affecting the operations of the Racecourse Betting Control Board.It will be observed that, in pursuance of the Cabinet decision, the Bill is a limited measure and does not cover the whole field dealt with in the Report of the Royal Commission. A comprehensive Bill dealing with all forms of betting, lotteries and gaming would include (in addition to the present contents of the Bill) provisions relating to betting off the course, to betting inducements and to gaming.PROVISIONS OMITTED FROM THE BILL.The following is a very brief outline of the matters omitted from the Bill : 1. As regards betting off the course, the main problem is that of street betting. The Royal Commission took the view that the only way to tackle this problem was to provide some alternative facility. The Cabinet Committee agreed with a recommendation of the Royal Commission that cash postal betting should be legalised as an alternative facility, and that bookmakers should be registered. One obvious advantage of the legalisation of postal cash betting is that it would remove the reproach that the existing law (which allows credit betting, but not cash betting in similar circumstances) represents &quot;class legislation.&quot; On the other hand, it is a matter of speculation how far postal cash betting would replace street betting, and a proposal to legalise postal cash betting would be criticised in some quarters on the ground that it provided additional facilities for betting.2. As regards betting inducements, the main proposals of the Royal Commission are that drastic restrictions should be imposed on bookmakers&apos; advertisements and that the activities of the professional tipster should be prohibited. The proposal to restrict bookmakers&apos; advertisements is largely consequential on the Commission^ recommendation that cash postal betting should be legalised, since without such restrictions it might be expected that there would be a very considerable increase in bookmakers&apos; advertisements, with a consequential extension of the betting habit.3. As regards gaming, the main recommendations of the Royal Commission were that the law relating to gaming houses should be clarified and consolidated; that, as regards gaming machines, the English law should be strengthened on the lines of the Gaming Machines (Scotland) Act, 1917, which prohibits the use of gaming machines in shops and other places; and that whist drives for small prizes should be legalised. The enforcement of the law is left to the Police, and it is their general practice to take such action as is possible to secure the suppression of automatic gaming machines, while they have been advised by the Home Office[9684] this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
not to interfere with whist drives, unless they have reason to think that actual harm is being done. There is no urgent demand for an amendment of the law relating to gaming, much as it needs clarification and consolidation, and this subject can well await any subsequent legislation of a more comprehensive character.CONTENTS OF THE BILL.The provisions of the Bill are based on the proposals made by the Royal Commission, as modified by the recommendations of the Cabinet Committee contained in CP. 1 (34). Both in regard to betting on the course and lotteries, the Cabinet Committee found themselves in substantial agreement with the recommendations of the Royal Commission; and though the Committee recom-mended important modifications of the Commission&apos;s proposals, the only matters of principle on which they found themselves at variance with the Commission were the recommendations of the Commission that the use of the totalisator should not be legalised on greyhound tracks, and that the Racecourse Betting Control Board should not be allowed to pay commission in respect of bets brought to the Board&apos;s totalisators from off the course by agency services. Following the recom-mendations of the Cabinet Committee, the Bill contains provisions legalising (subject to certain rigid safeguards) the use of the totalisator on greyhound tracks, and provisions will also be inserted to legalise the payment of commissions by the Board. These latter provisions will be framed in the light of the decision of the High Court in a case now pending on the question whether the payment of such commissions is lawful under the existing law.The Bill is admittedly a compromise, and to enable the Cabinet to have before them a clear picture of the effect of the Bill it may be convenient to indicate very briefly the important directions in which the Bill, on the one hand, relaxes the provisions of the existing law, and, on the other hand, imposes fresh restrictions.(A) Betting.Relaxations proposed by the Bill.(1) The Bill proposes the legalisation of the use of the totalisator; but the proposed extension of the use of the totalisator is confined to greyhound tracks and is made subject to rigid safeguards designed to prevent the exploitation by the operators of the public&apos;s betting propensity and to minimise the risk of fraud.(2) It is proposed to legalise the payment of commission by the Racecourse Betting Control Board in respect of bets brought from off the course to the Board &apos;s totalisators by agencies.Restrictions proposed by the Bill. The Bill proposes (1) that the number of days in any calendar year on which betting facilities may be provided at any track shall be limited to 104, and that no betting shall take place on any Sunday, Good Friday or Christmas Day;(2) that (save in the case of horse racecourses approved by the Racecourse Betting Control Board and of tracks used occasionally) betting facilities shall not be provided at any track unless the occupier holds a licence from the licensing authority, who are empowered to refuse a licence on certain specified grounds;(3) that, in order to reduce the opportunity for continuous gambling in any area, the 104 days on which betting facilities may lawfully be provided must be the same days for all licensed tracks in that area;(4) that, in order to prevent the managements of tracks from making undue profits from betting, the managements shall not engage, either directly or indirectly, in bookmaking; and shall not make excessive charges on bookmakers who attend their tracks;(5) that betting with persons under seventeen on a track shall be unlawful;(6) that in order to prevent a recrudescence of totalisator clubs and to prevent fraud, all betting on the totalisator or the pari-mutuel principle shall be unlawful, except in so far as it is permitted at approved horse racecourses and at licensed greyhound tracks.
(B) Lotteries and Competitions.Relaxations proposed by the Bill.The existing law prohibits all lotteries, private or public, and irrespective of their size and object. Under existing administrative practice the police do not interfere with private or quasi-private lotteries confined to members of some club or institution; and the police also turn a blind eye to various small public lotteries conducted at bazaars and similar entertainments.The Bill proposes to regularise the existing administrative practice by legalising bazaar raffles, and lotteries promoted in clubs, institutions or among persons working or residing on the same premises. The legalisation of these lotteries is made subject to a system of restrictions designed for the purpose of ensuring that they do not develop into large scale lotteries.Restrictions proposed by the Bill.The Bill maintains the existing principle that all large scale lotteries are unlawful.As pointed out by the Royal Commission, the existing law has proved adequate to deal with lotteries promoted in this country, but not with the sale of tickets in the Irish sweepstakes. The Bill re-enacts in a simplified form the existing elaborate and archaic code, and, in addition, seeks to deal with the situation created by the Irish sweepstakes by strengthening the existing law in the following respects : 1(i) It prohibits the publication of the results of drawings or any matterlikely to encourage the public to participate in lotteries, (ii) It makes it an offence to bring into this country, for the purpose of sale or distribution, any tickets or advertisements of a lottery.(iii) It prohibits the sending abroad by agents of money derived from thesale in this country of foreign lottery tickets.(iv) It proposes to make it an offence to use the post for the purpose of sending tickets, advertisements or money relating to a lottery.(v) It provides that a Court, when convicting in respect of a lottery offence,shall confiscate any money brought before it which the Court is satisfied represents subscriptions to the lottery.The Bill also prohibits all forecasting competitions conducted by newspapers or trading firms, and any other competition success in which does not depend to a substantial degree on the exercise of skill.The Cabinet are asked to authorise the introduction of a Bill on the lines of the attached draft, subject to any amendments of a minor or drafting character, which may be found to be necessary on further examination of the draft. A Scottish adaptation clause will be framed as soon as the main provisions of the Bill are finally settled.An appendix is attached, explaining the more important clauses of the Bill, and calling special attention to the most important points of principle on which specific directions of the Cabinet are desired.J. G. G. P. C.Whitehall, February 23, 1934.[9684]
APPENDIX.Notes on Clauses. Clause 1.THIS clause, which is based on a recommendation of the Royal Commission, adopted by the Cabinet Committee, imposes a limit of 104 days as the maximum number of days on which betting facilities (either by bookmakers or by a totalisator) may be provided on any track; and provides that betting facilities shall not be made available on Good Friday, Christmas Day, or Sunday. The object of this clause is to prevent the provision of facilities for continuous gambling throughout the year.Clause 2.This clause makes it unlawful for bookmaking to be carried on at any track (other than a horse racecourse approved by the Racecourse Betting Control Board or a track used for betting on not more than eight days in any calendar year) unless the occupier is in possession of a valid licence authorising the provision of betting facilities issued by the licensing authority in pursuance of the provisions of clause 5.The clause further provides that bookmaking shall not be carried on on any track which requires to obtain a licence, except on the 104 days specified by the licensing authority in pursuance of clause 8.Both clauses 1 and 2 provide that if unlawful betting takes place on any track, the occupier shall be deemed to be guilty of an offence unless he can prove that the offence did not occur by his sufferance.Clause 3.The effect of this clause is to prohibit all betting by means of the machine known as the totalisator and generally all betting on the pari-mutuel principle (whether or not a machine is used), except in the case of totalisators operated on horse racecourses in pursuance of the Racecourse Betting Act, 1928, or on licensed greyhound tracks in pursuance of clause 9 of the Bill (which provides inter alia that a totalisator can be operated on such tracks only on the 104 betting days fixed by the licensing authority). There is an express proviso, which maintains the present position under which it is lawful for an agency to receive bets and to transmit them to the totalisator on an approved horse racecourse. It would remain open to a bookmaker to offer to pay to his customers odds calculated with reference to the dividends declared by a lawfully operated totalisator.It will be observed that this clause is not limited to betting on the course. The reasons for prohibiting betting on the pari-mutuel principle, other than by the Racecourse Betting Control Board or by the operators of a totalisator on a licensed greyhound track, are as follows : (1) It is generally agreed that the mischiefs arising from what are known as &quot; tote clubs,&quot; whether conducted on a cash or credit basis, are so serious that no loophole should be left open for a recrudescence of this evil. It is at least doubtful whether a tote club in which the betting is conducted on credit terms contravenes the existing law.(2) Unsupervised betting on the pari-mutuel principle offers considerable scope for fraudulent practices; and there is no reason in the public interest why the State should set up the elaborate machinery which would be necessary to supervise off-the-course betting on this principle. Some of these businesses are no doubt conducted on honest lines, but the Royal Commission reported that they had reason to believe that other such businesses were of a fraudulent character.(3) If the financial position of the Racecourse Betting Control Board makes it essential that the Board should have a share in off-the-course betting, then a strong case can be made out for preventing their competitors from conducting betting on the pari-mutuel principle off the course, just as they are prevented from so doing on the course.
The prohibition of pari-mutuel betting was recommended by the Cabinet Committee as part of a scheme for regulating off-the-course betting; and Cabinet authority is sought for the inclusion in the Bill of a general prohibition of pari-mutuel betting (other than betting through a lawful totalisator), although that prohibition would extend to both on-the-course and off-the-course betting.Clause 4.This clause provides that the authorities to be entrusted with the function of granting licences authorising the provision of betting facilities on tracks shall be the Councils of administrative counties and of county boroughs.Provision is made for the combination of adjoining licensing authorities where they so desire, with the object of securing that the betting days should be the same over as wide an area as the authorities may determine.The Minister of Health agrees with the proposal made by the Royal Commission and approved by the Cabinet Committee that County Councils and County Borough Councils are the proper authorities for authorising the provision of betting facilities. At the same time it is important that the power of the Town Planning authorities to control the erection of tracks (as distinct from the provision of betting facilities) should be preserved, and provisions for this purpose are included in clause 5Clause 5.This clause provides the machinery for the grant of licences by the licensing authorities. It gives certain specified persons, whose interests might be prejudicially affected by the grant of a licence, the right to make representations to the licensing authority.The most important part of this clause is sub-clause (4), which prescribes the grounds on which a licence may be refused by the licensing authority. These grounds are that the grant of a licence would injuriously affect the health and comfort of persons living near the track, or would seriously impair the amenities of the neighbourhood, or would cause undue congestion of traffic, or seriously prejudice the preservation of law and order. In addition to these discretionary grounds, a provision has been inserted, after consultation with the Minister of Health, with the object of preventing any conflict of jurisdiction between the licensing authorities and the town-planning authorities. This provision is to the effect that a licensing authority shall not grant a licence for betting to a track unless the erection of the track has been sanctioned by the town-planning authority, or shall grant a licence subject to such sanction being obtained.Clause 6.Licences shall remain in force for seven years, and an annual fee not exceeding  50 (to be prescribed by the licensing authority for their area) shall be paid in respect of each licence. The fee is not intended as a tax on betting, and its sole object is to reimburse the licensing authority for the expenditure incurred by them in carrying out their duties under the Act.Clause 7.The Cabinet Committee were of opinion that, in view of the outlay involved in the erection of a track , it would be unreasonable to expose existing tracks to the risk of being closed down, through the immediate application to them of the licensing provisions contained in clause 5, and they recommended that existing tracks which have regularly been in use for betting should get almost automatically a licence which would last five years. Sir Walter Smiles&apos;s Dog Racing (Local Option) Bill, 1933, as amended in Standing Committee, provided for a moratorium of five years for existing tracks.The clause is of more immediate practical importance than clause 5, since few greyhound tracks are now being erected and all existing tracks will presumably apply for the five years&apos; licence proposed under this clause.Provisions have been included to ensure that this privilege of a special licence is not abused-for example, the special licence only applies so long as a track
is being used for the kind of sporting events at which betting took place during 1933. The object of this provision is to prevent existing grounds on which dog racing had never previously taken place from obtaining a licence under this elapse and being converted into dog racing tracks, with the result of considerably increasing the number of such tracks.Clause 8.A licensing authority must appoint 104 days in each year as the days on which betting facilities may be provided on licensed tracks in its area. The days appointed for betting by a licensing authority must be the same for all licensed tracks in the area of that authority.The object of these provisions is to prevent facilities for continuous gambling-being provided in any area, by requiring all licensed tracks in the area to provide betting facilities only on the prescribed days. Without a provision of this kind, the intention of clause 1 would be entirely frustrated.The clause does not apply to courses which do not have to obtain a licence from the licensing authority namely, approved horse racecourses and places used only on a few days in the course of the year.Clause 9.Sub-clause (1) legalises the use of totalisators, but only on dog tracks licensed by the licensing authority. The combined effect of this Bill and of the Racecourse Betting Act, 1928, would be that totalisators could lawfully be operated only on &quot; approved &quot; horse racecourses and on licensed greyhound tracks.The machinery for regulating the establishment and operation of totalisators on dog tracks is set out in the First Schedule of the Bill. The Schedule gives effect to the scheme recommended by the Cabinet Committee, who were opposed to the establishment of a statutory body for this purpose, and recommended the adoption of a form of control which would be free from the objections attaching to any form of State control. Following the recommendations of the Cabinet Committee, the Schedule provides that totalisators on dog tracks must be mechanically operated, that the amount deducted from the pools by the operators must be limited to 3 per cent., and that the operation of the totalisator must be supervised by a qualified accountant who is required to make periodic reports to the licensing authority. The object of these restrictions is to limit the exploitation of the totalisator for encouraging gambling and to prevent fraud. Power is given to the licensing authority in clause 14 to revoke the licence for betting in respect of a track if they are satisfied that any totalisator on that track has been maintained and operated otherwise than in accordance with the statutory requirements.The effect of Sub-clause (2) is to require the occupier of a licensed dog track on which a totalisator is operated to allow bookmakers to carry on bookmaking at that track. Without a provision on these lines, it is probable that the proprietors of a dog track which has a totalisator would exclude all bookmakers, since they would desire to divert all betting on the track to the totalisator in order to increase the turnover of the totalisator and so increase the amount to be derived from the deduction from the pools. The Cabinet Committee made no specific recommendation on this point in their Report; but it appears impossible as a matter of practical politics to omit to provide any protection for bookmakers on dog tracks, when Parliament has already decided in the Racecourse Betting Act, 1928, to give them protection on horse racecources and it is certain from representations made by the National Bookmakers&apos; Protection Association, since the date of the Cabinet Committee&apos;s report, that bookmakers would strongly oppose any Bill which, while allowing the occupier of a dog racing track to operate a totalisator, did not protect the interests of bookmakers by a provision securing that bookmakers shall be allowed to carry on bookmaking in competition with the totalisator.Specific Cabinet authority is sought for the proposal that the occupiers of dog tracks should be required to allow bookmakers to carry on bookmaking if a totalisator is in operation.
Since the Kempton Park case, the legal position of a bookmaker on a track has depended on the artificial question whether or not the bookmaker is &apos;&apos; using a place,&quot; a problem which has given rise to some not very solid distinctions. The effect of this clause is to make it clear that a bookmaker may lawfully take up a place at a track, with such portable equipment as he may require, for the purpose of bookmaking, provided that he does not use a permanent structure or that special places are not appropriated by the occupier or his servants to individual bookmakers.No question of principle arises on this clause.Clause 11.This clause limits the charges which occupiers of tracks may make to book-makers to five times the amount of the highest charge made to members of the public for admission to the same part of the track. The clause also contains a provision directed against the levying of any other charge on bookmakers as a consideration for allowing them to carry on bookmaking.This clause follows the analogy of a similar provision in the Racecourse Betting Act, 1928, where the charge for admission which may be made to book-makers is likewise limited to five times the ordinary charge for admission.Clause 12.This clause makes it unlawful for the occupier, or any other person having any interest or control over any part of a licensed track, to engage in bookmaking.The principle underlying this clause and the preceding clause, limiting the charge to bookmakers, is the same as that underlying the provision which limits the amount which may be deducted by the operators of a totalisator from the pools. As the Royal Commission pointed out, the profits derived by the manage-ments of the tracks from betting have been used for the purpose of increasing the facilities for gambling. At present, one dog track at least is known where the bookmakers are salaried employees of the proprietor, and it appears to be essential to tighten up the law in this respect.Clause 13.This clause prohibits betting on a track with young persons under seventeen.Clause 14.This clause prescribes the circumstances in which a licence for betting may be&apos; revoked. Revocation of a licence is the most important sanction for securing that the track has been conducted in an orderly manner, that the totalisator has been maintained and operated in accordance with the provisions of the Bill and that the occupier complies with the requirement to allow bookmakers to carry on their business when a totalisator is in operation.The Cabinet Committee decided that a licence should be revocable in such circumstances, but recommended that the power of revocation should be exercised only by Quarter Sessions (or on conviction of certain offences, by Quarter Sessions or Assizes). Great practical difficulties were experienced in trying to give effect to this recommendation. It was found on examination to be almost unprecedent-dented, at any rate in modern times, to give original administrative jurisdiction to Quarter Sessions in a matter of this kind, and the usual procedure is to empower the licensing authority to exercise the powers of revocation in the first instance. It has accordingly been thought right to empower the licensing authority to revoke a licence for betting granted by them, on the grounds specified in the Bill. At the same time it is recognised to be necessary to provide safeguards against an arbitrary exercise of the power of revocation and the Bill accordingly provides for a right of appeal from the decision of the licensing authority to Quarter Sessions, acting in their judicial capacity. There are in the Public Health Acts several instances of such a right of appeal to Quarter Sessions from administrative decisions of a local authority.
Specific Cabinet approval is sought for the proposal that the power of revocation should be conferred on the licensing authority in the first instance with a right of appeal to Quarter Sessions.Clause 15.The object of this clause is to safeguard the existing position under the Street Betting Act, 1906, which empowers the occupier of premises used for sporting events to prohibit betting on those premises on any day on which he exhibits a notice that betting is prohibited:Clause 17.Following the recommendations of the Royal Commission and the Cabinet Committee, this clause re-enacts the existing law. The effect of the clause is to make all lotteries unlawful, with certain exceptions provided for in later provisions of the Bill.Clause 18.This clause enumerates the acts in connection with the promotion of a lottery which are made illegal.   The majority of these acts are already illegal under the existing laWj but in accordance with the recommendation of the Royal Corn-mission, which was adopted by the Cabinet Committee, the clause seeks to relate the offences more closely than does the existing law to the methods of present-day lottery promoters.  In addition to re-enacting in a simplified form the prohibition of the existing law, the clause contains the following new provisions strengthening the law for the purpose of dealing more effectively with the Irish sweepstakes :  (1) It prohibits the publication of matter descriptive of the drawing or intended drawing of a lottery (including lists of winners), or any other matter calculated to encourage the public to participate in lotteries. (2) It makes it an offence to bring into or to invite any person to send into this country any tickets or advertisements of a lottery for the purpose of sale or distribution.  The onus is put on the importer of any large quantity of lottery matter, of proving that the importation is not for the purpose of sale or distribution. (3) It prohibits the sending abroad by agents in this country of counterfoils - or money derived from the sale in this country of foreign lottery tickets, and the offence of distributing tickets, advertisements, or money relating to a lottery, is so defined in clause 25 as to make it an offence to use the post for this purpose.As regards the publication in newspapers or elsewhere of matter relating to a lottery, the Cabinet Committee took the view that the publication of all such matter should be prohibited. In attempting to find words to give effect to this recommendation it appeared to be very difficult to justify a proposal that the Times should not be allowed to print an item of news, such, for example, as that for certain national purposes the Spanish Government had decided to promote a lottery or to report an inquest on the prize-winner in some lottery. Accordingly, the clause penalises the publication of matter (other than advertisements, drawings and lists of winners, which are wholly prohibited), only if that matter is calculated to act as an inducement to the public to participate in lotteries. Specific Cabinet authority is sought for this limitation.The attention of the Cabinet is also specially drawn to the provisions relating to the use of the post the effect of which is that the use of the post for the distribution of lottery matter is made unlawful. The Post Office were advised by the Law Officers in 1895 to the effect that they should not allow the post to be used for underakings of an illegal character, and in pursuance of that advice all open postal packets containing lottery matter are detained. The Postmaster-General has, however, no power to open sealed packets; and these can only be opened and detained in pursuance of a warrant issued by the Secretary of State under the prerogative power which is recognised in the Post Office Act, 1908. Under the existing law it is not, however, an offence to use the post for transmitting lottery matter, and the only action that can be taken is to detain packets when observed in the course of transmission.   It is believed that if the
use of the post for this purpose were made illegal, large numbers of persons who at present make use of it would be deterred from so doing, and the necessity for exercising the distasteful duty of examining suspected correspondence for the purpose of detecting lottery matter would, it is hoped, largely disappear. The Joint Select Committee on Lotteries (1908) recommended, inter alia, that the use of the post for lottery matter should be made illegal, and the proposal in the Bill follows the analogy of other statutory provisions which make the use of the post illegal for the transmission of, e.g., indecent advertisements.Clause 19.This clause exempts small lotteries conducted at bazaars, sales of work, &amp;c.r from the general prohibition of lotteries, provided that certain conditions are complied with. These conditions are framed with the object of limiting the size of the schemes, by eliminating the element of private gain, by allowing only prizes in kind, and by limiting the sale of tickets to persons attending the bazaar.The only point arising on this clause to which special attention should be called is that relating to the limitation of the sale of tickets to persons attending the bazaar. The limitation was not included among the Cabinet Committee&apos;s recommendations, but, in drafting the Bill, it was felt that unless some such limitation were imposed a loophole would be provided by which the exemption in favour of harmless bazaar raffles would provide opportunities for carrying on schemes on a very large scale, which would give rise to all the mischiefs against which the law regarding lotteries is aimed.Specific approval is required for the proposal that the sale of tickets in a bazaar lottery should be limited to persons attending the function.Clause 20.This clause exempts from the general prohibition of lotteries certain small private lotteries promoted among members of societies, clubs, or institutions, or among persons working or residing in the same premises, provided that they comply with certain conditions. Like the conditions governing bazaar lotteries, these conditions are designed to limit the size of the schemes and to prevent them from developing into large-scale lotteries.The principal features of the scheme of legalisation are as follows : (i) the promoters can only sell tickets to members of the club or to persons working or residing on the same premises, as the case may be; but the scheme does not make it unlawful for tickets to be passed on by the purchasers to other members of the public; (ii) the promoters can only issue the tickets in return for cash representing the value of the tickets. The object of this provision is to prevent the indiscriminate broadcasting of books of tickets, for which no initial payment has to be made, and which are hawked around for sale;(iii) the element of private gain is eliminated by providing that the wholeproceeds of the lottery, after the payment of certain specified expenses, shall be devoted to prizes or to the purposes of the society;(iv) restrictions are imposed on the extent to which the lottery can beadvertised;(v) every ticket must bear on the face of it a statement of its price (which must be the same for all tickets), and a statement that prizes will be paid by the promoter only to persons to whom tickets can lawfully be sold by the promoter; (vi) no use may be made of the post for the distribution of tickets.   .The restrictions on private lotteries proposed by the Bill are numerous and drastic, but it has to be remembered that under the existing law all lotteries are unlawful, and these restrictions appear to be necessary if the legalisation of private lotteries is not to offer scope for ingenious persons to promote large lotteries of a public character.Clause 21.This clause enables the Board of Trade to revoke their sanction to Art Unions, if they think fit to do so, without requiring the Board to be satisfied (as they must be, under the existing law) that the Union is no longer being run for
the encouragement of the Fine Arts. The Board of Trade desire this power to enable them to exercise a more effective supervision over Art Unions than is possible under the existing law.Apart from this, no alteration ic made in the law relating to drawings by-Art Unions; and no question of principle arises.Clause 22.This clause provides savings, for the purpose of making it clear that certain loans issued by His Majesty&apos;s Government, foreign Governments and corporations shall not be deemed to be lotteries, merely by reason of the fact that the bonds or stock to be redeemed at a particular date are to be settled by chance.The exact terms of this clause have not yet been finally settled.Clause 23.This clause prohibits what are known as forecasting competitions conducted by a newspaper or in connection with any trade or business, or any other competition so conducted success in which does not depend to a substantial degree on the exercise of skill.The clause follows the recommendations of the Cabinet Committee, and it is believed will be welcomed by the great majority of newspapers.Clause 24.This clause empowers Justices to issue a search warrant, authorising the police to enter and search premises and to remove documents or money believed to relate to an illegal lottery. There is power under the existing law to obtain a search warrant in respect of premises used for illegal betting, and this clause provides similar powers in respect of illegal lotteries. The clause would be in substitution of powers under existing statutes to break into premises where lotteries are being carried on and to arrest offenders and (in connection with an arrest of offenders) to seize lottery matter.Clauses 26, 27 and 28.These clauses will be drafted in the light of the decision to be given by the High Court in a case now pending on the question whether it is lawful for the Racecourse Betting Control Board to pay commission to outside agencies in connection with bets transmitted to the Board&apos;s totalisators by such agencies.The effect of the proposed clauses will be : (1) To legalise the payment of such commissions by the Board.(2) To amend certain provisions of the Racecourse Betting Act, 1928, for the purposes of removing doubts as to the legality of the Board&apos;s present practice in conducting &quot; double event pools &quot; and &quot; pre-race pools.&quot;(3) To provide that the totalisator on an approved horse racecourse shall be operated only by the Board itself or by the management of the race-course under a licence granted by the Board.Specific Cabinet authority is required for the inclusion in the Bill of provisions to this effect.Clause 30.Sub-clauses (1) and (2) of this clause provide penalties for offences under the Bill.Sub-clause (3) provides that the Court, on convicting a person of a lottery offence, shall order the forfeiture of any money and the destruction of any documents (including cheques, postal orders, &amp;c.) which are in the possession of the police and are shown to the satisfaction of the Court to represent sums subscribed to the lottery. A provision on these lines is necessary for the purpose of disposing of the material seized by the Police in executing a search warrant under clause 24, or in the possession of the Police in the case of money found in the course of transmission through the post to lottery promoters abroad.
Unless there were a power to confiscate such material, it would be necessary for the Police either to deliver it to the promoter or to endeavour to return the money in their possession to each individual subscriber. When a lottery promoter has been convicted of an offence and the lottery (having been declared unlawful) is stopped, it is clearly undesirable that the proceeds of the lottery should be restored to the promoter, who would thus reap considerable financial benefit from his defiance of the law. On the other hand, there are the strongest objections to throwing on the police the responsibility for returning money seized to individual subscribers. Quite apart from the enormous burdens which this responsibility would throw on the Police, it would open the door to numerous fraudulent claims and to endless disputes.For these reasons the Royal Commission and the Cabinet Committee thought it necessary that power should be conferred on a Court to order the confiscation of lottery subscriptions, and past experience in other fields shows that if such a power is to be exercised the power should be mandatory rather than discretionary in form, since the Courts would have no criterion for determining the considera-tions which would justify them in refraining from making an order for confiscation, and the provision would tend to become a dead letter.It is hoped that the power to seize (which clause 24 confers) and the power to confiscate (which this clause confers) subscriptions to a lottery will have a strong deterrent effect on lottery promotion. These combined powers should make it unnecessary, save in the most exceptional cases, to make use, in respect of lotteries promoted in this country, of the prerogative power of opening and detaining lottery matter sent through the post, and in future the use of the prerogative power in this field would be almost wholly confined to stopping the transmission of matter relating to lotteries promoted abroad.While the power of confiscation will secure the substantial advantage of preventing the promoters of illegal lotteries from reaping their harvest, it must be pointed out that from the point of view of the subscribers it will work rather unevenly. In the first place, money can only be confiscated if it is in the hands of the Police and by order of a Court. In the case of money found in the post in the course of transmission to a lottery promoted abroad, it would not be practicable, in view of the amount of work involved, to bring each individual subscription before a Court and small sums would have to be returned. An even greater difficulty is the difficulty presented by cheques. Cheques cannot be effectively dealt with, and it may be argued that the provision will work inequitably in that the rich man who subscribes large sums by cheque will not have his money confiscated, while the poor man who sends cash will be penalised. On the other hand, it may be anticipated that when the public begin to realise that subscriptions are liable to confiscation, there will be a tendency to have greater recourse to the use of cheques.The specific authority of the Cabinet is sought for the provision that the Court should have the power to order the confiscation of money and documents relating to an illegal lottery, and that the power should be mandatory on the Court.o
Unless there were a power to confiscate such material, it would be necessary for the Police either to deliver it to the promoter or to endeavour to return the money in their possession to each individual subscriber. When a lottery promoter has been convicted of an offence and the lottery (having been declared unlawful) is stopped, it is clearly undesirable that the proceeds of the lottery should be restored to the promoter, who would thus reap considerable financial benefit from his defiance of the law. On the other hand, there are the strongest objections to throwing on the police the responsibility for returning money seized to individual subscribers. Quite apart from the enormous burdens which this responsibility would throw on the Police, it would open the door to numerous fraudulent claims and to endless disputes.For these reasons the Royal Commission and the Cabinet Committee thought it necessary that power should be conferred on a Court to order the confiscation of lottery subscriptions, and past experience in other fields shows that if such a power is to be exercised the power should be mandatory rather than discretionary in form, since the Courts would have no criterion for determining the considera-tions which would justify them in refraining from making an order for confiscation, and the provision would tend to become a dead letter.It is hoped that the power to seize (which clause 24 confers) and the power to confiscate (which this clause confers) subscriptions to a lottery will have a strong deterrent effect on lottery promotion. These combined powers should make it unnecessary, save in the most exceptional&quot; cases, to make use, in respect of lotteries promoted in this country, of the prerogative power of opening and detaining lottery matter sent through the post, and in future the use of the prerogative power in this field would be almost wholly confined to stopping the transmission of matter relating to lotteries promoted abroad.While the power of confiscation will secure the substantial advantage of preventing the promoters of illegal lotteries from reaping their harvest, it must be pointed out that from the point of view of the subscribers it will work rather unevenly. In the first place, money can only be confiscated if it is in the hands of the Police and by order of a Court. In the case of money found in the post in the course of transmission to a lottery promoted abroad, it would not be practicable, in view of the amount of work involved, to bring each individual subscription before a Court and small sums would have to be returned. An even greater difficulty is the difficulty presented by cheques. Cheques cannot be effectively dealt with, and it may be argued that the provision will work inequitably in that the rich man who subscribes large sums by cheque will not have his money confiscated, while the poor man who sends cash will be penalised. On the other hand, it may be anticipated that when the public begin to realise that subscriptions are liable to confiscation, there will be a tendency to have greater recourse to the use of cheques.The specific authority of the Cabinet is sought for the provision that the Court should have the power to order the confiscation of money and documents relating to an illegal lottery, and that the power should be mandatory on the Court.o
