THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 01&apos;&apos; HIS BRITAINIC majesty&apos;s S GOVERNMENTCAB I N S T. ^SECRET. &quot; JCOPY NO..CP. 55(54).ANTIMONY POISONING DUB TO THE USE OF ENAMELLED VESSELS.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.1.      I wish to circulate information as to certain measures which I am proposing to take with regard to the use of antimony in enamelled vessels.2.      In the preparation of enamel for hollow-ware and similar articles it is customary to use tin oxide as an opacifier.      A few firms have adopted the practice of using antimony instead of tin because it is cheaper.3.      Antimony enamels are liable to be acted on by organic acids and in recent years some serious outbreaks of illness have occurred through the preparation of lemonade and other acid drinks in vessels coated with such enamels. In most of these cases the vessels were not intended to be used for containing food but there was nothing to indicate that there would be any danger if they were so used.4.      In February 1933, I issued a memorandum giving particulars of the outbreaks of illness which had then been reported and conveying the warning that &quot;enamelled hollow-ware vessels obviously intended for other purposes may be dangerous if used for the preparation or storage of food or drink&quot;.      Some further cases have been reported since that date.
5.    Following the issue of this memorandum, representations were received that the use of antimony in enamel for hollow-ware should be prohibited.    The representations included a resolution from the Wrought Hollow-Ware Trade Employers Association, which was passed unanimously at a meeting at which 90$ of the Enamelled Hollow-Ware manufacturers of the United Kingdom were represented.6.    It has been stated by the International Tin Research and Development Council that 85$ of the worldTs tin is smelted on British territory and there appears to be no antimony produced on British territory.7.    I have thought it desirable to have special investigations made in order to consider whether any further measures are necessary and a report has now been made by a technical officer of my Department.    This reporf deals with the facts stated above and shews that almost all enamels containing antimony give up small amounts of the metal to food.    The control,  or preferably the prohibition,  of antimony in enamelled hollow-ware is recommended in the report.8.    There are serious practical difficulties in securing effective control by such methods as the marking of vessels or allowing the use of only certain specified antimony compounds,  and I propose that legislation should be introduced for prohibiting the importation,  manufacture or sale/of e&quot; defined class of hollow-ware containing antimony in the enamel.
9.       The matter has been discussed with the Board of Trade and I understand that the President would be agreeable to legislation on these lines but considers that the manufacturing and importing interests should be consulted as to details (including the definition of the class of goods to be regulated) .10.     The matter has also been discussed with the Department of Health for Scotland, and the Secretary of State concurs in the action proposed.11.      I propose therefore to publish the report to which I have referred and to proceed in consultation with the Board of Trade and the interests concerned to prepare legislation on the lines set out above.(IETLD.)      E. H. Y.23rd February,  1934.
