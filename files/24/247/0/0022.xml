1.   I regret that I must he in Manchester tomorrowj otherwise I should have ashed at the meeting of tho Cabinet for permission to raiset as a natter of   &quot;urgency.;, the question of French quotas.     It was impossible for me to circulate a memorandum on the subject earlier, as the latest French proposals were only received on January 21stjand even now their examination is not complete 0   As I am unable to be present at the meeting, and as I have   not been able to ask in advance that the question be raised specially, I hope my colleagues will forgive me for circulating thismemorandum at such&apos;   short notices2.    My colleagues will recollect the trouble we had. with the French at the end of last year about the 15 per cent, ad valorem discriminatory surtax and the differential import turnover tax.   Ultimately,  after securing the authority of the Cabinet to take counter-measure3 (Cabinet Conclusions 59 and 68)  and after publicly threatening such measures, we secured the removal of the surtax as from 1st January,1934, and an undertaking to remove the differential Import turnover tax as soon as legislative powers could be obtained. It was part of the understanding that the two countries would enter into conversations in due course for the adjustment of their commercial relations.   The French have now tried as from the beginning of 1954 to improve their negotiating position-1-rXXJUHBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAJHBIO MAJESTIES.

vis-a-vis not only ourselves &quot;but other countries by introducing drastic reductions in import quotas, with the avowed object of securing concessions in return for the restoration of the quotas to their former level.     United Kingdom trade has been severely hit by these restrictions. Apart from coal, the volume of United Kingdom trade affected in articles to which quota restrictions were applied was about  4 million per annum and as the cut in quotas was no less than 75 per cent, the effect was to reduce the volume of trade to about  1 million per annum.Representations against this action were made to the French Government and they were given to understand that it would not &quot;be possible for His Majesty1 s Government to contemplate giving effect to the oral agreement to initiate conversations, which is referred to above, in the unequal situation resulting from this action.     Before, however, any formal protest could actually be 1 odged, the French authorities intervened to say that, of their own free will, the Government had decided to restore to 100 per cent the quotas on a &quot;very abundant list&quot; of United Kingdom goods.     This list was received on 21st January and it shows that while 100 per cent, is in fact to be restored on a wide range of the British trade affected, nothing has been done in regard to cotton yarns, most classes of cotton piece goods,  certain kinds of electrical material and a few other articles of minor importance.   Moreover, in the case of motor cars, cycles and parts, copper sulphate, certain kinds of textile machinery and some other classes of goods of less importance, the quotas are only to be restored to 75 per cent, of the former figure.     It is roughly estimated that the reduction in the value of our trade resulting from these failures to restore the full 100 per cent, quotas is  500,000 per annum, of which cotton yarns and piece goods account for about  200,000, motor cars, cycles and parts for  120,000 and copper sulphate for  65,000.
But objectionable as is this arbitrary reduction in the volume of our trade in goods subject to quota restrictions, a far worse feature is the resulting discrimination actual or potential against ourselves in comparison with other importing countries.     According to an announcement made by the United States Embassy in Paris, the 100 per cent, quotas have been restored to all classes of United States goods.     The United states do not send to France appreciable quantities of cotton goods or of some other classes of goods on which our full quotas have not been restored, but they do send substantial quantities of motor cars and parts, of textile machinery and of certain other categories of less importance.     There is thus already in force actual discrimination against us in favour of the United States on certain of the goods concerned.     Further, while we have no direct evidence on the subject, it is persistently rumoured that; Belgium has had, or is about to have, all her quotas restored to 100 per cent, and if this is so there is or will be discrimination in her favour notably in respect of cotton yarns and piece goods, motor cars and cycles and parts, and certain kinds of electrical and textile machinery.     Attempts are being made to confirm these rumours, but as a general policy of secrecy is being followed in France regarding the , concessions which France is making to the various countries, it may be impossible for us to verify them for some time.I turn now to coal,     The French note gives the quota for coal as 90 per cent, the remaining 10 per cent being subject to negotiation; but it is not quite clear whether the 90 per cent, is based on the imports before the beginning of December,1933
(when a 10 per oent cut was made) or whether a further 10 per cent cut is contemplated.     Enquiries have &quot;been made on this head and it is hoped to have the information almost at once.   In any case, 10 per cent of our coal trade with Prance is v,iorth to us about  700,000 a year.While the Trench have come to terms with the United States and probably also with Belgium, they are not known to have concludes arrangements as yet with any other country.     Indeed both Germany and Italy have already adopted retaliatory measures.Other countries, notably the Motherlandst have been considering the use of quotas for purposes of bargaining in the same way as the French, and, as it is &quot;well known that we are in controversy with the French about their quotas, there is a grave risk that we may find our trade with other countries si . ilarlv- prejudiced if we show any Ytieakness In dealing with the Trench.In all the circumstances, I recomra^rn: that we should at once inform the prsnch that, having regard to the &apos;-crave interference with United Kingdom trade resulting from their n.\; quota policy and to the discriainatorg character of the reductions which they still maintain on important classes of British trade, we cannot tolerate the existing situation;    that we find ourselves forced to take immediate retaliatory action, unless they have met the situation to our satisiaction within, say, ten days from the date of the intimation.I accorc;ingly ask for the authority of my colleagues to take the action suggested in the preceding paragraph.     I also ask for authority to settle meanwhile, after consultation with the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the ^chequer and the Secretary of state for Foreign Affairs, the terms of an Order under Section 12 of the Import Duties Act imposing special duties on a suitable ranje of French goods.Board of Trade*23rd January, 1934. i.
