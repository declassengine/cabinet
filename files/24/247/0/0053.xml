TO  BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.M --- 1 &apos;   324&apos;It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document. This document i________________ ____Sovermiment.-CABINET. Copy Wo.......INCITEMENT    TO    SEDITION    BILL.Memorandum   by    the   Home    Secretary.1. I have been considering the provisions of the draftIncitement to Sedition Bill which was approved by the Cabinet oh the 18th October, 1933  (Cabinet 53  (33), Conclusion 6), and I shall be glad if the Cabinet will authorise an extension of this Bill so as to cover the Police as well as the Defence Services.      The question of including the Police within the scope of the Bill was not before the Cabinet in October but the extension of the Bill to the Police would be a small matter and I have no reason to suppose that it would make the Bill any more controversial.2. The Cabinet will remember that the Bill has two objects -(a) to provide a summary method of dealing with attempts to seduce members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces from their duty and allegiance;(b) to empower Justices of the Peace to grant search warrants if they are satisfied that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that an offence under the Bill has been committed.3. So far as regards the former of these objects, no newprovision is required for the Police as it is already, under Section 3 of the Police Act, 1919, an offence  (which can be dealt with summarily) to cause or attempt to cause disaffection amongst the Police.4. As regards the latter object, however, there are inrelation to the Police no provisions as to the possession of documents the dissemination of which among members of the Police Force would be an offence under the Act of 1919, nor any provisions as to the right of search for documents, etc.SECRET. CP.  53(34).
23rd February, 1934.comparable with those proposed to be enacted in relation to the Defence Services by the Bill.5. A good deal of information has come to light recentlywhich suggests that the Police Service contains at least a proportion of men who could not be relied on to withstand attempts to undermine their loyalty, and though the evidence that such attempts are being made is not so strong in the case of the Police as in the case of the Defence Services, there can be no doubt- that the risk of such attempts is a serious one.     I think therefore that it would be desirable to take the opportunity of this Bill to extend the powers which already exist under the Police Act, 1919, and I am advised that such an extension would, in certain contingencies, be of great value.6. The grounds on which the Cabinet decided that the Billshould not deal with the Civil Service do not apply in the case of the Police.      The Police Service is a disciplined Service comparable in general though not in detail with the Defence Services;    Parliament has already considered it necessary by the Act of 1919 to make special provision for dealing with attempts to create disaffection among the Police, and it is therefore appropriate that any measure for extending the existing powers for dealing with attempts to create disaffection among the Defence Services should also be applied to the Police.J.G.
