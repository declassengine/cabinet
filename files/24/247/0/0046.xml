this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s government Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1934.SECRET. Copy No.  43CP. 46 (34).CABINET.HOUSING POLICY  COMMITTEE.REPORT.AT their Meeting on the 7th February, 1934 (Cabinet 4 (34), Conclusion 13), the Cabinet had before them memoranda on Housing Policy by the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. 12 (34) and CP. 34 (34)) respectively, and agreed : (a) That in view of the importance of the Minister of Health&apos;s proposals, the policy envisaged therein should be considered in the first instance by a Cabinet Committee; (b) that the composition of the Cabinet Committee should be left to the Prime Minister and the Lord President of the Council in consultation with the Minister of Health; (c) that the matter should be treated as one of urgency.The composition of the Committee was subsequently settled as follows : The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman).      -The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.The Secretary of State for Scotland.The Minister of Health.The Minister of Labour.The Postmaster-General.The First Commissioner of Works.We have carefully examined the various considerations and proposals set out in the Minister of Health&apos;s memorandum (CP. 12 (34)), and are in general agree-ment with his conclusions as to the nature and scope of the problem in England and Whales and the measures to be taken to deal effectively with it. Our attention has also been directed to the exceptional circumstances affecting the housing problem in Scotland, to which reference is made in the Memorandum of the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. 34 (34)), and we recognise that the Minister of Health&apos;s proposals may in their application to Scotland call for some modification to meet the special Scottish conditions.We are satisfied, for the reasons given in the Memorandum, that the decisions taken in 1932 to terminate subsidy in aid of housing generally and to concentrate effort on slum clearance were right and proper, and we should deprecate as a retrograde step any proposals to revive the housing subsidy on the former basis.The particulars given on page 2 of the Memorandum indicate the substantial progress which has been made in regard to slum clearance since the coming into operation of the Act of 1933. We are unanimously agreed that the Government cannot limit their housing policy to slum clearance alone, that, now that the campaign against slums is under way, the time is ripe to deal with certain other aspects of the housing evil, and, in particular, with overcrowding and redevelop-ment in relation thereto, and that if these aspects are vigorously and satisfactorily disposed of, the Government will have dealt with the main evils of which public opinion complain.   But we are clearly of opinion that no scheme could be[9657]
considered satisfactory which did not contemplate a level of rent within the capacity of the class who now occupy the buildings to be dealt with.The Cabinet will recall that the Minister of Health&apos;s principal proposals relate to Reconditioning : Overcrowding and Redevelopment: and Management.Reconditioning.We have no comments to offer on the reconditioning proposals on pages 2-4 of CP. 12 (34). We understand that the Minister does not contemplate that any form of Exchequer assistance will be necessary to enable the Local Authorities to implement the reconditioning proposals. We agree with the Ministers view that the recommendation of the Moyne Committee that Public Utility Societies should be brought on the scene as housing authorities for reconditioning alternative to and capable of replacing the present housing authorities should be rejected. It should be clearly recognised that the duty of the local authority in housing matters is primary and that the relation between the two bodies will be that the local authority may accept the proposal of a Public Utility Society to carry out some specified part of its programme. We also agree with the Minister in thinking that the Moyne Committee&apos;s proposal to adopt the &quot;refund&quot; basis of compensation for houses compulsorily purchased for recon-reconditioning should not be entertained.Overcrowding and Redevelopment.This is mainly a problem of the large towns, London in particular. The object to be attained is the rehousing under proper conditions and at reasonable rents of the overcrowded population either on the present site or in its imme-diate neighbourhood. Normally, this will necessitate the clearing of the site, and the erection thereon of blocks of flats, instead of ordinary small houses.Both these considerations (central sites and flats instead of houses) involve extra expense and it is clear that the Local Authorities, whose full and active support is essential to the success of the scheme, will not be prepared to undertake it without State aid. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has informed us that provided the two conditions, namely, the use of the central sites and the erection of blocks of flats, are satisfied, he will be prepared to consider the grant of Exchequer assistance towards the extra cost involved. The Minister of Health would have liked to go further and to have been empowered to offer a subsidy in special cases (which may be expected to arise in the smaller rather than the larger towns) where the local authority may desire to rehouse the overcrowded population not on or near the central site in flats but in ordinary small houses on undeveloped land on the outskirts. The other members of trie Committee see very grave objection to any such extension of the proposal. Apart from other considerations, it appears to them that it would be impracticable to attempt to draw and to maintain a distinction between these special cases and ordinary unsubsidized housing schemes and that the result would be a demand for the revival of the housing subsidy in its discarded form. In these circumstances the other members of the Committee agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the offer of the subsidy should be strictly limited to those cases which satisfy the two conditions named by him. Some members of the Committee expressed the hope that it might be possible for the proposed subsidy to be made conditional on a definite maximum weekly rental per unit; and, in order so to keep down the costs of building the new tenement blocks, special efforts will have to be made to encourage the adoption of modern technical improvements, even if these would require the modification of the bye-laws of some Local Authorities.Management.We are in general agreement with the proposals regarding &quot; Management&quot; set out on pages 6 and 7 of the Memorandum, including the establishment by statute of the proposed Central Committee with wide co-ordinating and advisory functions.In the concluding paragraph of his Memorandum the Minister of Health asks for general approval in principle of his proposals in order that he may then enter into negotiations with the local authorities. These negotiations will be difficult and prolonged, but if the new scheme is to be a success it is imperative that it
Treasury Chambers, February 16, 1934.should only be launched after the fullest discussion with the authorities, and, if possible, with their entire support. It will not be possible to determine the financial conditions (including the basis and amount of the subsidy), until the negotiations with the authorities have been completed, and we are informed that it is improbable that the Minister will be in a position to bring his final detailed proposals to the Cabinet for sanction for some considerable time. We would suggest to the Cabinet that these final proposals should be examined by the Committee (which might be kept in being for the purpose), before being submitted to the Cabinet for final approval.We submit the following recommendations to the Cabinet :  (a) That, subject as stated in (b) below, general approval in principle shouldbe given to the various Housing Policy proposals set out in the Minister of Health&apos;s Memorandum (CP. 12 (34)).(b) That as regards &quot;overcrowding and redevelopment &quot; the offer of financialassistance from the Exchequer should be strictly limited to cases where the rehousing is effected on or near the central site by means of blocks of flats and should not be given in cases where the rehousing is effected by means of ordinary small houses erected on undeveloped land on the outskirts of the area of the local authority.(c) That as regards Scotland it should be recognised that some modification in the Minister of Health&apos;s proposals will be necessary to meet the special housing circumstances in that country.(d) That the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for scotland should be authorised to open negotiations forthwith with the local authorities in England and Wales and Scotland respectively on the basis of the proposals as approved by the Cabinet.(e) That in order to ensure the most satisfactory outcome of the discussions with the local authorities it is desirable that as little publicity as possible should be given to the Government&apos;s new proposals pending the results of those discussions. (/) That after the conclusion of the discussions with the local authorities the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland, in con-sultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, should prepare and circulate to the Committee (which should be kept in being for the purpose) detailed final proposals with a view to the Committee submitting a report thereon to the Cabinet.Signed on behalf of the Committee :NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN. Chairman.
Note by the Lord President of the Council.I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to the last sentence of paragraph 8 of the attached Report. The wording of this sentence is taken from a joint Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, which was eh-culated to the Committee. It has been suggested on behalf of the Secretary of State for Scotland that the opening words of the sentence should read : &quot; We note the recommendation in paragraph 21 of the Report that very careful consideration . . . .&quot; Owing to the absence from London of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it has not been possible to ascertain his views on this suggested alteration, and in these circumstances it seemed best that his original wording should be retained, on the understanding that the point is reserved for consideration by the Cabinet at their meeting on the 21st February.(Signed) STANLEY BALDWIN.February 16, 1934.
