TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.VERY SECRET.CP,  11  (54)o COPY NO.CABINET,ANGLO-SOVIET NEGQTIATIQNS.BALANCES IN THIS COUNTRY BELONGING TO FORMER RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, &apos;Note by the Chancellor of the ExchequeroIn accordance with the suggestion made during the discussion on the Anglo-Soviet negotiations at the meeting of the Cabinet on the 15th November, 1933 (Cabinet 62(33) Conclusion 3), I circulate herewith a memorandum agreed between the Treasury and the Board, of Trade on the subject of balances belonging to the former Russian Government (including the Russian State Bank)0(Intd)o    N.CoTreasury Chambers,s.w.1..17th January, 1934.
Memorandum by Treasury and Board of Trade.I, The only important balances are those held by messrs. Baring.      Messrs. Baring feel bound not to disclose the amount except under an Order of the Courts.      The Treasury have been told very confidentially that the balances amount to over  6 millions^ but that various claims may be made good which would reduce the net amount to  3 millions or less.2. In May 1918 the Treasury requested Messrs. Baringto pay over these balances,, but Messrs. Baring were advised that they could not properly comply with this request, which indeed had no legal backing.Prom 1921 to 1927 the balances were protected by Article X of the Russian Trade Agreement whereby the Soviet Government undertook not to claim them.In May 1927 the Russian Trade Agreement was denounced. The Government decided to introduce &apos;special legislation to &quot;block&quot; the balances and Messrs. Baring in effect undertook not to part with them in the meantime without an Order of the Court.      But in the autumn of 1927 the Speaker decided that such a Bill must be a &quot;Hybrid Bill&quot; involving a delay of some six weeks between the publication of the proposals and the Act coming into force.      In March 1928 it was decided to drop the idea of legislation,  especially as no claim had been put forward in the meanwhile.In July 1928 Messrs. Baring gave to His Majesty&apos;s Government an undertaking not to part with the balances in return for certain assurances.      Both the undertaking and the assurances were limited to the period during which the existing Government was in office and accordingly lapsed when the Labour Government came into power in May 1929, and they have not been renewed since then.
3. The existing position is very unsatisfactory, since this  6 millions is lying idle to the benefit of no one. In equity the money should be paid to the British taxpayer since, broadly speaking,  it represents money advanced to the former Russian Government for the prosecution of the War, but not used for this purpose.      Alternatively it might be proposed to use the money as a fund for meeting the creditors of Russia.     But the Soviet Government seem unlikely to agree to this unless the money is accepted in final settlement of all claims against Russia.The claims registered with the Russian Claims Department amount to some  260 millions and Rs;1,000 millions made up as follows:-(l)    Bondholders owning bonds for  40 millions (nomina and Rs.250 millions (nominal).(2)    Claimants and creditors for about  40 millions and Rs,753 millions.(3)    Owners of nationalised industrial and commercial properties in Russia who claim upwards of  180 millions, but are probably entitled to a con-si derably smaller sum if their claims could be judicially assessed.It would be an extremely difficult task to distribute a sum of between  6 millions and  3 millions between 36,000 claimants for  200 millions or more, especially as many of the claims can never be accurately assessed after a lapse of 16 years and with no access to the properties and account-books in Russia.     But the available money would no doubt relieve much hardship if only distributed in ex gratia awards to those claimants   who have been left in a state of actual destitution, or their dependants.4. Failing an agreement with the Soviet Government thatBritish nationals would abandon all claims arising out of the Bolshevik Revolution in return for an assignment to the Crown by the Soviet Government of their claim to these balances, they could only he obtained by confiscatory-p-
legislation.      Such legislation has been considered on various occasions in the past., but has not been proceeded with on account of the difficulties to which it gives rise. Moreover, it might well prove impracticable if an interval of six weeks has to elapse between the announcement of our intentions and the passage of legislation.      In any case legislation to confiscate foreign bank balances in London is open to obvious dangers and might involve lasting injury to the reputation of London as a financial centre, besides leading to the immediate withdrawal of foreign (e.g. German) balances.5. The conclusion seems to be that no action can usefully be taken about the Baring Balances until negotiations with Russia about claims and debts generally can be undertaken with some hope of being less of a fiasco than the abortive negotiations of 1924 and 1929.17th January. 1954.
