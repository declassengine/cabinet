Copy No.CP. 14 (34).CABINET.THE FRONTIER BETWEEN ITALIAN LIBYA AND THE ANGLO-EGYPTIAN SUDAN. [With Map.]Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I THINK it necessary to circulate to my colleagues in the Cabinet a note uponathe difficult situation which has arisen with Italy over the determination of the frontier between Italian Libya and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.Even before the war of 1912-13, by which Italy wrested from Turkey the territories of Tripolitania, Cyrenaica and Libya, the Italian Government had constituted themselves the champions of Turkish claims on the southern boundary of Libya. Those claims, to which the Italians have now in fact succeeded, and which are based on temporary Turkish occupation, extend at the present time far into the French Sudan, including Tibesti and Borcu, and reaching towards Lake Chad as their ultimate goal.The interest of this controversy for the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan lies in the fact that in 1899 and again in a slightly modified form in 1919 His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government agreed to define their respective zones of influence by a line starting from the intersection of the Tropic of Cancer with longitude 160 and continuing in a south-easterly direction until it meets longitude 24&quot; at the 19&quot; 30&apos; parallel of latitude. From that point the definite boundary (since 1923) follows longitude 24c to the south. The French regard the line referred to above as constituting a definite frontier. Our view of these agreements is that they purported to be nothing more than an agreement between the United Kingdom and France, under which each country undertook not to claim or take steps to acquire sovereignty in the sphere of influence allotted to the other by these agreements. The agreements did not purport to recognise that either Power actually at that moment possessed sovereignty up to these lines, nor to deny any title of any other Powers to parts of these areas, and explanations in this sense of these agreements have already been given by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Italian Government.The frontier between Egypt and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was fixed by the Anglo-Egyptian Convention of 1899 along the 22nd parallel. How far this northern boundary of the Sudan extended along that parallel to the west has never been determined; but it has for many years been customary to extend it in our maps until it met the Anglo-French line of influence referred to above. The resulting inclusion in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan of the narrow strip of desert known as the Sarra Triangle has never been disputed, until quite recently, by Italian cartographers; the strip is desert only, with no settled population and with the Sarra Well as its only source of water.Of rather more importance is the mountain of Owenat, situated across longitude 25Q at the tri-junction point between Egypt, Libya and the Sudan. Owenat is 10 miles across and rises to 6,000 feet, with wells at Ain Doua on the south-western side and at Kharkhour Mourr on the south-eastern side. The north-west and north-east portions of the mountain, which contain no water, lie admittedly within Libya and Egypt respectively.   I understand that the Air7212   [9539] b
Ministry attach some&apos; strategical importance to the possession of Owenat (south of the 22nd parallel of latitude) and the Officer Commanding the Sudan Defence Force has recently stated that he would view its possession by a foreign Power as an anxiety and a source of embarrassment. No permanent British, Egyptian or Sudan post has ever been stationed there. There is again no settled population, though Owenat is on the track of various caravan routes; its importance is due to its water supply and to its character as a landmark in the desert.As the result of a series of events which are summarised in chronological sequence in the Annex to this paper the Italians, working from Kufra Oasis, which they captured from the Senussi in 1931, are now established at Sarra Well and at the south-western Owenat Well (Ain Doua); the Sudan title to these places has to some extent been maintained by periodical Royal Air Force reconnaissances from Egypt, as well as in the diplomatic correspondence with the Italian Government.The conversations held in Rome in November last made it clear that the Italians were unwilling to accept any compromise solution such as one which would preserve the whole of Owenat south of the 22nd parallel to the Sudan, while ceding to Libya the Sudan&apos;s rights over the Sarra triangle (this is substantially a repetition of a proposal made by Lord Milner in 1920). These conversations further revealed that the Italians no longer regard Owenat (as well as Sarra) as a stage in their advance upon French Tibesti and Borcu, but intend also to utilise their occupation of the Ain Doua Well to further a claim (based on grounds to which I shall refer below) to a considerable slice of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan proper. The claim put forward at Rome extended to longitude 27Q, including the Oasis of Merga. ,In the face of these Italian claims instructions were given, after consultation with the War Office and Air Ministry, for the occupation of Merga by Sudan forces which are expected to arrive there before the 21st January, air reconnaissance having shown that the Italians are not there before us. Royal Air Force machines from Egypt are also to visit the eastern Owenat Well (Kharkhour Mourr) within the next day or two and to convert their visit into an occupation if the Italians are not there already and if the water supply is sufficiently accessible. They will be relieved by Sudan land forces as soon as practicable.Should these operations be completed successfully, we shall be in effect in a position to ensure the maintenance of the Sudan&apos;s western boundary at least as -along longitude 25&quot;, i.e., as a continuance of Egypt&apos;s boundary with Libya.But in any one of the following cases (a) should the Service Departments attach sufficient importance to the western Owenat Well (Ain Doua) to make it indisputably necessary to pursue our claim to it; (&amp;) should we be forestalled by the Italians in our attempted occupation of either Merga or Kharkhour Mourr (or both); or (c) even though we are satisfied with longitude 25Q as the western boundary of the Sudan, should it prove impracticable to induce the Italians to agree it with us or to consent to arbitration in any one of these eventualities it seems to me that His Majesty&apos;s Government may have to consider the expediency of some move to induce a more reasonable frame of mind in the Italians. Such a move would be the occupation of the Ain Doua Well by a Sudan force, conjointly with the Italians.So soon as the limits of military occupation on each side are determined my Department will submit to me their recommendations for the future conduct of the discussion with the Italians, including the desirability of recourse to one or other of the various forms of arbitration. I must explain here that the Italians are in physical occupation of the Sarra Well and of the well at Ain Doua. While it would probably be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to bring the matter before the Permanent Court of International Justice under the Optional Clause, in that case His Majesty&apos;s Government would be in the position of plaintiffs and, in claiming territory which was in the possession of another Power, would have to assume the onus of proof and showing sovereignty, in the Sudan, and in this His Majesty&apos;s Government would be very likely not to succeed. On the other hand, to submit the matter for decision in any other way would require the agreement of the Italian Government to terms of reference, and it is by no means certain that the Italian Government would agree to any terms of reference which excluded from the decision of the tribunal the Italian extreme claim to territory well to the east of Owenat, which has hitherto been regarded as indisputably
Sudanese. In an uncertain legal position as regards sovereignty possession being of so great importance, it has been thought well that the Sudan should also be in the position of a party having physical possession in respect of those wells in the disputed area where the Italians have not at the moment established any possession, and this is the principal reason for the occupation of Kharkhour Mourr and Merga. I need only add that, in view of French anxiety recently reiterated lest our proceedings should in any way confirm Italian claims upon French territory, it may be necessary to claim sovereign rights over the Sarra triangle, which the Sudan have never, in fact, exercised, if only in order to cede these rights to the Italians. The same consideration may even, in itself, determine the issue as between arbitration and a renewal of direct negotiations.The Italian claim, to which I have referred, to the Oasis of Merga and to the north-west corner of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan proper is founded upon a map which accompanied a Turkish decree (&quot; firman &quot;) of 1841 purporting to define the boundaries of Egypt (and, though less directly, those of the Sudan). A copy of this map was reproduced in the Green Book published by the Egyptian Govern-ment in 1926 after the conclusion of Egypfs negotiations with Italy for the determination of her western frontier with Libya. Application for permission to examine the original has been made to the Turkish Government, but even should it be forthcoming, and should it be found to be authentic, I am advised that no considerable weight need at this date be attached to it. It indicates the western boundary of the Sudan as somewhere in the neighbourhood of longitude 29c.J. S.January 16, 1934.ANNEX.Owenat and Sarra Triangle. Chronological Sequence of Events.1923.Owenat (mountain 10 miles across, rising to 6,000 feet) discovered by Hassanein Bey.1925-26.Owenat visited by Prince Kemal-ed-Din.October 1930.Owenat visited by expedition under Major Bagnold.January 24, 1931.Italian troops occupied Kufra Oasis.February 1931.Egyptian Desert Survey party under Mr. Clayton working at Owenat when refugees from Kufra came through.February 1931.According to stories told to Sudan officials by refugees from Kufra the Italian forces reached Sarra and killed refugees who had taken refuge there.March 13, 1931.Sir Spnald Graham told the head of the African Department in the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs that Owenat was in Sudan territory.. The official concerned formulated a reserve regarding Owenat, and said he would reply after consulting the Italian Colonial Office.[9539] b 2
April 1932.Wing-Commander Penderel, Sir R. Clayton-East-Clayton and Count Almasy visited Owenat by car, and Wing-Commander Penderel marked out a landing ground near Ain Doua. He is not sure whether the Italians had been there already or not.June 1932.Sir R. Graham informed the Italian Government of the composition and aims of Major Bagnold&apos;s forthcoming expedition to the Sarra Wells, and added that the communication was made in accordance with the existing friendly relations and to prevent the risk of any untoward incident.July 6, 1932.The Italian Government replied claiming that Sarra wells, &amp;c, were not in Sudan territory, but formed part of the territory of Libya. They would afford all possible facilities to Major BagnokTs expedition.October 1932.Two R.A.F. aircraft, under Wing-Commander Penderel, were sent to Owenat. Italians were met for the first time at Ain Doua on the 10th October, having, according to Major Bagnold, arrived there two days before. They had already marked out a landing ground. The Italian military party were accompanied by two aircraft and four cars. On the 10th October Wing-Commander Penderel marked out a landing ground much nearer to the well at Ain Doua than the Italian one. Major Bagnold found the Italians in &quot; military occupation &quot; of Sarra Well.January 1933.The second visit by RAP. aircraft to Owenat took place on the 15th January, 1933, when it was discovered that the Italians had established a dump of fuel at Ain Doua. No Italians were present on this occasion, but there was evidence that they had paid at least one visit since October 1932.May 1933.A further RAP. reconnaissance was carried out to both Owenat and Sarra between the 1st and 10th May, when an Italian military party were found to be encamped at Ain Doua, having been there for about a month; it was understood that they intended to stay for at least another month they were engaged on surveying and map-making. The corner markings of the R.A.P. landing ground had been removed, but the full petrol tins and oil drums were intact. On this occasion the R.A.F. party marked out a separate and better landing ground than that used by the Italians. It was also discovered on this occasion that the Italians had marked out a landing ground at Sarra.July 1933.On the 12th July the counsellor of the Italian Embassy called at the Foreign Office in order to draw attention to the fact that RAP. planes had landed at Owenat, &quot; which is situated in Libyan territory and is under Italian administra-tion and permanent occupation,&quot; on the 6th May without notice having been given to the Italian authorities.On the 18th July Sir R. Graham handed in a note to the Italian Government stating that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not regard the actions taken by the Italian forces in the Sarra triangle as constituting or reinforcing Italian claims to the territory, and suggested that conversations might be opened with a view to settling the question of sovereignty.September 1933.A further R.A.F. reconnaissance to Owenat and Sarra was carried out after preliminary notice to the Italians between the 12th and 18th September, and an Italian military party was again encountered, who stated that they were remaining indefinitely. The landing ground marked out by the RAP. in May had not been interfered with.
*    118[See Overleaf for Map.]October 1933.The Italian Government replied on the 19th October to Sir E. Graham&apos;s note of the 18th July agreeing to conversations in Rome, but maintaining the views which they had previously expressed.November 1933.Conversations took place at Rome, the 27th-30th November, between Mr. Peterson and Wing-Commander Penderel and representatives of the Italian Government. The latter showed no desire to reach a compromise solution, and claimed that the Sudan frontier with Libya should start from the intersection of longitude 270 and latitude 22and should follow longitude 270 south to latitude 19c, when the line would turn south-west to join the French frontier at latitude 16c.  The extent of Italian claims was thus revealed.
