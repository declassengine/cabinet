THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   January 1934.SECRET Copy No.O.O.S. 320.COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.THE FRONTIER BETWEEN ITALIAN LIBYA AND THE ANGLO-EGYPTIAN SUDAN. sREPORT.THE Cabinet, at their meeting held on Wednesday, the 24th January, 1934 (Cabinet 2 (34), Conclusion 10), directed-:&apos; That the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence should be invited at once to furnish a report on the strategic importance of the Owenat and Sarra Triangle, referred to in the Memorandum (CP. 14 (34),&quot;and we accordingly considered this question at a meeting held on Thursday, the 25th January.*2. We understand from telegram No. 249 from Cairo, dated the 31st December, 1933, that, in general, the view of the Sudan Government is that the existing boundary on longitude 24&quot; up to a point (about latitude 19&quot; 45&apos;) settled with the French on the Boundary Commission of 1919 should be maintained, but from this point the exact line of the boundary in a northerly direction until its intersection with latitude 22&quot; is not a matter of vital importance to the Sudan Government.3. We do not consider that the Owenat-Sarra Triangle is of particular strategic value. &apos; At the same time, we feel it is essential to put a check to Italian encroachments towards the east and south, and particularly that the Italians should be prevented from occupying the Merga Oasis, at which place they would not only be much closer to the Nile, but within easy reach of a series of oases giving access both to the south and to the east. As regards the Jebel Owenat, while of itself it may not have any particular strategic value, it is, we understand, only some eighteen hours from the Nile by motor transport, and its occupation by a foreign force is therefore undesirable. We attach, however, more importance to the retention of Merga than to the retention of Owenat.4. There is also a further point, rather of a psychological nature, which is that the extension of another country&apos;s powers into territory which has hitherto always been regarded as within the sphere of the United Kingdom may entail loss of prestige, which might not be confined to those living in the locality affected.. This seems to us another reason for checking Italian encroachment.5. We are also under the impression that France attaches some importance to the restriction of Italian activities in this area. There is always the possibility that behind the Italian moves may be some ulterior motive connected with other territories in this part of Africa.* U.O.S. 117th Meeting.[9570]
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. January 26, 1934.i;6. In conclusion, therefore, we are of the opinion that, although the area concerned is not of particular strategic importance, it is desirable to check Italian activities, and, in any case, that we should insist on the retention of Merga, and that we should endeavour, as suggested by the Government of the Sudan, to adhere to the existing boundary line.Summary of Conclusions. 7.   Our conclusions may be summarised as follows : (a) That, although the Owenat-Sarra Triangle is not of particular strategic importance, we agree with the view of the Sudan Government that the existing boundary settled with the French on the Boundary Commis-sion of 1919 should be maintained, since it is desirable that Italian encroachments should be stopped.(b) In the event of difficulties in the maintenance of the existing boundary,we attach importance to the retention, in any case, of Merga, and we should prefer that the Jebel Owenat is also retained, though it is of less importance than the former place.(c) That the psychological effect of Italian encroachment in an area hithertoregarded as a British domain cannot be altogether ignored.(Signed) ERNLE CHATFIELD.A.
