DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.     225J *;ET. COPY NO.__35 ( 34).CAB I N E T.CONCESSIONS TO AUSTRIA.Memorandum by the president of the Board of Trad-;.1. With reference to the memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, dated January 22nd,  (CP.19(34)), Baron Franckenstein and Dr. Schiiller called to see me today to discuss their suggestions for obtaining an improvement in Austrian exports to the United Kingdom,They referred to the comparatively small share enjoyed by Austria in the import trade in the United Kingdom of any classes of goods and appreciated that this fact made it difficult for us to make general reductions of duty applicable to_.aH countries.. Their proposal was that the United Kingdom should givo the desired encouragement to Austrian trade by entering into an agreement under which (when it came into force) a quota of Austrian goods would be admitted into the United Kingdom at a reduced rate of duty.    They suggested that the volume of any class of goods to which this proposal should apply shculd be the volume of our imports of those goods from Austria in 1930 and that the reduced rate of duty should be one-half the existing rate.    The most convenient way would probably be for the duty to be collected by our Customs at the usual rate and half the duty would be remitted periodically by us to the Austrian Government for distribution among the Austrian manufacturers.2. If this proposal is regarded as one for giving preference to Austrian goods it is, of course, ope..1 to other countries enjoying most-favoured-nation rights in the United Kingdom to protest.    Dr. Schliller professed himself satisfied that the probability of protest from other countries was so small that he would be quite prepared to accept the riak of the scheme being abandoned on that ground.    If, however, any country entitled to
2?^st w Omost-favoured-nation treatment made objections in regard to any particular article,  that article could be omitted before the arrangement was brought into force;    if they objected    in principle the whole agreement would go, but v/e should at least have indicated publicly our readiness to help Austria.    The limitation of the scope of the preference to a fixed quota was proposed by Dr.  ;Schuller in order to provide a safeguard for our own manufacturing interests as most or all of our imports from Austria are competitive with our own manufactures.3.    New legislation would be necessary to give effect to this suggestion.    In effect the Treasury is asked to make a payment from the Exchequer to the Austrian Government to be used to assist Austrian manufacturers to compete against our own and other foreign manufacturers in the United Kingdom market.    Attached is a paper giving particulars of the rates of duty and of the volume of trade in the goods to which Dr.  Schttller suggests the proposal should apply.    On the assumption that the value of Austrian imports affeeted by the arrangement is the same as in 1930 the estimated cost to th&apos;  Exchequer would be some &apos;3175fOOO a year.4.    The objections which I have already outlined tc the Cabinet to granting Austrian manufactures preferences, whether openly or disguised in the form su:;:oested by Dr. ochtiller,  still in my opinion remain as strong as ever, and the particular method suggested by Dr. Schuller intimately concerns the Treasury.If, however,  the Cabinet decide that in spite of these objections discussions should be proceeded with along the lines outlined by the Austrians,  an endeavour should certainly be made to obtain an adequate return for British trade as part of a trade agreement.    Dr. dchtlller in fact indicated that the Austrian Government would be prepared to consider proposals for increasing the quotas of United Kingdom goods which could be admitted into Austria.    He particularly mentioned coal and I understand that th quantity of coal which the Austrian State Railways consume and could be asked to take from the United Kingdom is 250,000 metric tons a year.    I&apos;he actual imports of British coal into Austria are
about 40,000&quot; tons per efnnum*.-v Further- there are-&quot;concessions in regard to austrian import quotas on certain articles we export to Austria, such as cotton yarns, cotton tissues, rubber tyres, linoleum, motorcars, and possibly certain other goods which might reasonably be pressed.V/.R.Board of Trade,6th February, ly&apos;34,
