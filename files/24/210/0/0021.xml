Ill(THIS unnUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OF. HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)S E  OR S  copy No.CP.  71  (30)CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE POSITION OF government employees WHO TOOK PART IN THE GENERAL &quot;           STOPPAGE OF 1926.REPORT.   1.  At their Meeting on the 22nd January, 1930, (cabinet(30) Conclusion 10) the Cabinet had under furtherconsideration the position of certain Government employees who took part in the General Stoppage of 1925 and agreedthat a Cabinet Committee composed of the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (In the Chair), the First Commissioner ofWorks and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, should review the question again and. advise the Cabinet as towhat should be their final attitude.   2. The facts of the case are set out in the Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper CP. 248(29))circulated to the Cabinet on the 19th September, 1929, andmay be briefly summarised as follows:-      Then the General Stoppage of 19^6 took place some450 &quot;hired&apos;  men and. a number of established (i.e. permanent and pensionable) employees in certain Admiralty Establish-ments stopped work.   Of the established men who came out a number returned to duty on being warned of theconsequences of their action, but all the 1 hired&apos; men and32 of the established men remained away for the whole periodof the Stoppage..   The &quot;hired&apos;  men and the established, men-1-
112who returned to wor&apos;i after warning were subjected to nopenalty.   The other established, men (with one exception)were subsequently readmitted to the establishment and accepted certain conditions of readmission of which one was the forfeiture in each case, of a small partof his previous service for pension instead of allprevious service which would in the usual course havebeen the penalty for such a break of established service.o.    In his Memorandum the First Lord reminded theCabinet that this decision of the late Government waschallenged by the Labour Party at the time* expressedthe view that in all the circumstances the penaltiesare heavy and that insistence on them would, reflectno credit on the State and suggested that if it wasdecid.ed to remit the penalties this should not be doneon any grounds that might be held to imply a generaladmission of the right of established employees ofthe State to go on strike, nor any condonation of theaction of these particular men who have already been declared by the officials of their unions to have actedwrongly.   The penalties could, he suggested, be remitted purely as an act of grace, with the object of removing a widely felt sense of grievance for what is felt to have been an unduly harsh decision.4.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer in a memorandum circulated to the Cabinet (Paper CP. 258(29) ) drew attention to certain grave objections to this proposalset out in a Memorandum by Sir Warren Pisher who pointedout that:-
13   &quot;Once it is accepted that the first duty of H.M.Government is to safeguard the existence of thecommunity, and that in order effectively todischarge this duty, the Government must at all times he able to count on the loyal support ofthe civilian and military employees of the Statewho are the instruments through which it operates,it is surely beyond question that the offence ofstriking is the most serious offence against Govern-ment that a civil servant could commit and the lastoffence which any Government mindful.of its   tresponsibility to the community, would lightlycondone. ;l        &quot;Consistently with this view,  Parliament has     sanctioned the grant of pensions  to civil servants     on the condition that they shall  have rendered faithful     and satisfactory service, and has in express terms     decreed that it is unlawful for the Treasury to     award the full rate of pension to a civil servant     who cannot, when he retires, be certified to have     served throughout his career  with diligence and     fidelity.&quot;and also stated that so far from being unduly harshlytreated, these men had        &quot;in fact been treated far less severely than the     police strikers who in 1919 were  dismissed from the     Service and have lost the whole of their pension.     And the penalty of a ten per cent deduction from     pension (or of the loss of all pre-strike service     for pension purposes) is still being imposed on the     post office workers who went on s&quot;trike in 1890. &quot;5.    Mr.  Snowden was inclined to agree with Sir WarrenPisher that the remission of penalties would &quot;tend toloosen their feelings of obligation to conform totheir terms of service&quot;, was impressed by the serious repercussions which must result from the total remission of the penalties and expressed the view that to concede the request for remission in the present case would, be dangerous.6.    At the Meeting on September 25th, 1929, (Cabinet35(29) Conclusion 8) the Cabinet in effect adopted theview of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.   The First lord was pressed, by the Member for Deptford. for a reply and. heduly informed Mr. Bowerman that the matter could not bereopened.
1147.   After further considering the circumstances of thecase we recommend the  adoption of the proposals set out in-oar.-great .phs 11 and IS of the First Lord&apos;s Memorandum(CP. 248(29). ), namely, that the penalties should heremitted as an act of grace in all the cases other thanthat of the man who was dismissed for alleged definiteacts of misconduct and that his  case should not hereopened unless the Tracle Unions concerned do so and.produce prima facie evidence of a miscarriage of justice.8.   In our view the Government in office in 1926 must bear a great share of responsibility for the GeneralStoppage and its consequences.   Moreover, the penaltiesinflicted, on tie established employees at Deptford should.bo contrasted with the complete immunity enjoyed by menin comparable positions (and with comparable superannuationrights) in outside industry.   Immediately after thetermination of the Stoppage in 1926 Mr. Baldwin in theHouse of Commons on loth May, described the appeals he had made to railway companies and. other large undertakingsnot to alter the conditions of employment of their employees who returned, to work and. specifically referred tothe  .-.decision of the I...  cz N, H. Railway Company that themen should go back &quot;at rates of pay they were receivingbefore the strike and without loss of service&apos;&quot;&apos;.    In theview of the First lord. and. the First Commissioner of Porks,it is unthinkable that Government employees in government establishments should.be subjected, to less favourable treatment than the late Prime Minister advocated, in thecase of railway and. other employees.
                                                         19.   The circumstances of 1926 were altogether exeptional and it is almost inconceivable that they can ever recur.The present case can, therefore, be treated as a special case and dealt with strictly on its merits.   It isnecessary to bear in mind the very difficult situation inwhich these particular men found themselves, having regardto the action of their fellow workmen.   Their misconductwas little, if any, graver than that of the &apos;hired&apos; menand the other established men who have suffered no penaltyof any sort.10.   Y/hilst we recognise the imperative importance ofmaintaining the principle that the first duty of an established, civil servant is loyalty to the Government ofthe day, we think that the course now recommended by uscould be adopted without prejudicing or impairing themaintenance of this principle.    At the same time we are agreed, that adequate safeguards against the possibilityof any such contingency must be devised.   One of us,indeed, holds that the Government should make it clearthat in future no employee of the State or of a LocalAuthority should be allowed to strike and such employeesshould be bound, to accept compulsory arbitration and toabide by its findings.   \7e are agreed, that the wholecuestion should, receive most careful  -examination inconnection with the proposed, legislation to amend theTrade Disputes and. Trade Unions ^:.ct, 1927, especially inview of Section 5 of that Act applying to the CivilServi ce.11.   The Financial Secretary to the Treasury dissentsfrom the Conclusions which we have reached and recommends
the Cabinet to adhere to the decision taken by them  inSeptember, 1929, for the reasons set out in his Reportattached hereto.                    (Signed)   A. V. ALEXANDERS                               GEORGE LANSBURY.7hitehall  Gardens,  S.1.  Larch  3rd.,  1950.

I find myself reluctantly compelled to dissent from the recommendation of my colleagues on this matter.My reasons are as follows1.        I regard as an inviolable principle the lo7yaltyof the Civil Servant to the Government of the day.   Ifit be suggested that an industrial worker is only technicallyto be regarded as a Civil Servant, I would urge that the fact of his establishment, if it is to mean anything, places aspecial fiduciary responsibility upon him.2,        I would&apos;welcome the release from all penalty ofthe men in question, if it were possible to do sqwithoutcreating a precedent for the future.   But I can see no way of achieving this.   No asseveration by the Governmentof the duty of loyalty on the part of a Civil Servantwould weigh on a future occasion against the fact of itscondonation of the past;  for deeds speak louder than words.I can conceive of circumstances, on either side in politics,in which the Opposition were much more pledged than in thepresent instance to reinstate Civil Servants and the present case would be quoted in justification for doing so.3*        I think it was open to the Government of the day-1-IS DOOPMEMT Ib  THE PROPERTY OJ;  HI3  BRITAIJNIC  IL-JLSTY^  GQYERU LIIT)a

Finally the present Government has already taken a decision and announced it0   To change it now would give an unfortunate appearance of yielding to pressure.          I accordingly am of opinion that the decision reached by the Government in Secptember 1929 not to makeany change in this matter should be allowed to stand,,                        (Sgd) F.W0PETHICE LAWRENCE.Treasury Chambers,     26th February,  1930.
