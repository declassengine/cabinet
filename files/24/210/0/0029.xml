THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;s GOVERNMENT.CRET.  79(30).COPY NOCABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE AGRICULTURAL MARKETING--g^--3.                           Report.          At their meeting on the 29th of January, 1930,  (cabinet (30),  Conclusion 2) the Cabinet had before them a memorandumby the Minister of Agriculture (CP.25 (30)) outlininghis proposals for legislation in regard to the marketing ofagricultural commodities, and agreed that a Cabinet committee consisting of -          The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (in the Chair)          The President of the Board of Trade,          The First Lord of the Admiralty,          The Secretary of State for Scotland,should examine the memorandum and prepare a Draft Bill for submission In the first instance to the Cabinet.          In accordance with the wishes of the Cabinet the Committeehave had special regard to the need for safeguarding the interestsof consumers and have had the benefit of an outline of theproposals of the President of the Board of Trade for setting up aConsumers1 Council.          The deliberations of the Committee have mainly centeredon this question of protecting the consumer and of securing thatthe bodies created under the Bill for the marketing ofagricultural produce should not be able to act in restraint of trade,by withholding supplies from particular traders or organisations, apoint to which the First Lord of the Admiralty, in the interests ofthe Co-operative Movement, attached great importance.          The Committee were at first disposed to reoommend that
the Agricultural  Marketing Bill  should  provide  for the protectionof the consumer through the machinery of the  proposed Consumers&apos;Council.   In view,  however, of the  congestion in the parliamentary programme  and the consequent   uncertainty as  to the date whenthe legislation setting up the Council  would  become law, thethe Committee decided that self-contained provisions for theprotection of the consumer should be  inserted in the Bill.  Theseare set out in Clause 3 of the Draft  Bill,  under which if a complaint  is made to  the Minister with  rogard to the operations of a body  administering a scheme under  the Bill, he may appoint an independent ad hoc Committee  to  investigate  the complaint,  andafter such investigation the  Minister is empowered by order toamend or revoke the scheme as he thinks fit or  he may require the body administering the scheme to rectify the  matter.   In reachingthis decision the Committee took into account the undesirabilityof putting in too many safeguards for the consumer, otherwisefarmers would be  apprehensive and be  disinclined to formulate sdi-anesforsetting up marketing  bodies.          On the  suggestion of the  First Lord of the Admiralty ithas been made clear In the Bill  (Clause 3(1)  on page 7) that themachinery  for the investigation  of  complaints can be invoked Ifa marketing body  is acting contrary to  the Interests of any large body of consumers.   This would enable the Consumers&apos; Co-operative movement to raise complaints  not only as consumers but also inconnection with attempts at restraints  of trade or holding up ofsupplies by producers&apos; organisations.          The Committee were  impressed  with the need for legislation to enable the formation of  schemes  to deal with the marketing  of milk and potatoes,  in  order to avert a possiblecrisis in  the dairy industry  during the coming  summer and avoid a repetition next  season of the present disastrous slump in potatoprices. The Committee understand that  the farmers1 representatives at the Agricultural Conference are  displaying considerable interest
nistry of Agriculture and Fisheries.     7th March, 1930.     in the proposals  outlined in  the Bill which has been  submitted     to them  confidentially, mainly because they foresee the     possibilities  of  dealing with these two commodities at an early     date.7,             neither the machinery of the Companies Acts nor of  the     Industrial  and Provident Societies Acts would be suitable for     the  incorporation of the administrative bodies for marketing     purposes proposed to be set up under the Bill.    The Bill     therefore provides in Clause  2 special legislative provisions     for  incorporating these bodies under the Bill.   This is on     the  analogy of certain Dominion legislation under which similar     marketing organisations have  been set up.8.             The  financial provisions for creating Agricultural     Marketing Funds for England and Wales and Scotland set out In     Part 2 of the  Bill are still  under discussion with the Treasury     as to details, but the Treasury are in agreement with the general     principles.    The Committee are satisfied with the financial     provisions  set out in the Draft Bill, subject to any detailed     amendments  which  may be agreed between the Departments concerned.

(6) The Minister,  immediately  after  approving  a  40      scheme, shall publish the scheme and the order approving      it in the Gazette and in such other manner as he thinks      best for informing  the persons affected thereby that the      scheme has been approved.
