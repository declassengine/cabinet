COPY HO.  jC A B I II E I.THE AGRICULTURAL SITUATION IK SCOTLAND.(Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by Instructions from the Prime Minister.     19th February 1930.    (Sd.)  LLP,A .Hankey. )     There are three main divisions of farming in Scotland  -the hill farms where sheep and cattle are bred, dairyfarms, and arable farms where grain, potatoes, and  cattlefeeding are tho chief interests.   Dairy and  arablefarming are often combined.   The hill farms  have beenvery profitable for a dozen years, the-dairy  farmers are doing moderately well, but most of the arable farmers arein serious difficulties.2.   -Arable farming has never recovered from  the slump in 1928.   It appeared as if an improvement was settingin towards the end of 1924 but the summer of  1925 sawprices falling again.   The neat &quot;war&quot; between Vesteysand the Chicago combine&quot; which lasted for about two  years was followed by two cold wet seasons in 1927  and 1928  .and many farmers found themselves involved in lossesboth these years, following on five lean years before that.   Last year was a disastrous year for nearly  allthe arable farmers.
3,   The first trouble was the fall in beef pricesowing to the abnormal drought in England forcing farmers to send cattle to market because of the dearth ox grass?The unfavourable seasons of 3.927 and 1926 and the refusal of the distillers to buy barley induced many farmers to grow oats instead of barley and 1929 saw oats increasedby 1G,000 acres.   The crop was a record one and the totalproduce is estimated by the Department of Agriculture at51j000 tons above that of 1928.   Potatoes were also a record crop&apos;and exceeded 1928 by 123,000 tons.  prices for both oats and potatoes have fallen to prices much below pre-war levels.   Oats are lower than for 40 yearsand both oats and potatoes are now practically unsaleable.Large quantities cf both will not be alls to find tuyorsat any price,40   It would have been difficult under any circumstances to dispose of the whole potato crop because it was inexcess of the market needs, but a succession of circumstances put the price below .cost of production fromthe beginning.,   Early potatoes from the continent werethrown on the market at throw away prices when the Ayrshireearlics were ready to market,   They could not be soldand were on the market when second earlies come on, whichhad to be held until the main crop was ready.   The result was slaughter prices right along the line *   I estimate that potato growers will lose anything from  10 to  12an acre if they can sello   If they do not manage to sell the loss will run from  15 to  20 an acre.5o   When oats were ready to come on the market merchantswore hawking samples of German oats at 7/Sd a cwt.   Oatsfell steadily from that price down as low as 3/od a oWt.,in the North East of Scotland, and oven at that pricebuyers are char3r.   Farmers would require about 8/- a cwt.to make it worth while to grow oats,                              -2-
6 .   The effect of the slump in prices was felt at the november hirings from the Tay to Inverness,   Only the single men were to hire then and we never had so many men left unemployed.   Prices had not then reached thelow level they have reached since otherwise I am confidentthe position would have been worse.   The farmers wereshaky then but they are in a panic mood now.   They have lost confidence completely in crop  -growing and are trying to reduce their acreage.   The effect will not be feltuntil the end of this year because the married men are engaged until  8th hay and most farmers could not reducestaffs until then, but I fear they will do so when theyget the opportunity and it will be in 1931 that we shallsee the big reduction in cropping.7.   It is unlikely that we shall see such a combination of adverse circumstances as in 1929.   Had it.beenstanding by itself, bad as it was, I do not think Scotsfarmers would have been frightened, but it came at theend of a series of bad years when most of  them were about the end of their cash resources and  pretty heavilyindebted to the banks and to auctioneers and merchants.They were forced to market immediately after harvestand the offers of German oats were used \)j the merchantsto force down prices.   The merchants miscalculated badlyand most of them have been caught with stocks on a marketout of which the bottom has dropped, but that makes theposition worse for the farmers who have not sold.8.   we aro not likely to see a  collapse in the industry.It is to everybody&apos;s interest to keep the  farmers goingand creditors will hang on to all except the weakest who may have to go under.  &apos; Most of  the farmers will adjustthemselves to the altered circumstances and reduce theircommitEients wherever they can.   That is the disquieting
feature from the social x)0int of view.   The process of reducing cultivation will be rapidly accelerated uhle&amp;bsomething can be done to restore confidence before theHi ay t e rm.9.   The potato growers have the matter in their own hands.   They can organise their own marketing and preventthe market being glutted when an extra large crop isgrown.   The scheme is prepared now and the report ofthe Departmental Committee on Marketing will be completedthis week.   77e recommend a guarantee for bank credit to enable the crops to be financed between harvest andactual sale so as to prevent forced selling at harvesttime.ICc &apos; The oat crop is a more difficult problem.   Itis the keystone of arable farming in Scotland andunfortunstely the demand is a decreasing one.   Theimport is only about 11 per cent of the total consumption in Great Britain, and has not been a serious competitoruntil the last two years when Germany has come into themarket again.   German oats are of high quality andcompare favourably with the best Scots oats.   The saleof Import Certificates gives the German exx)Orter aconcealed subsidy of about 3/- a cwt.   That means thatthe importer of German oats oan make the price on ourmarkets. &apos;  It will not be an easy matter to organisea Co-operative Marketing Agency for oats under any circumstances but it is quite hopeless as long as themarket is open to German oats with a 3/- subsidy.   Theeffect is psychological, perhaps, but that does not makeit any easier to got over and from what I saw in Prussiain November I think the export of oats to this countryis likely to increase.
11.   In their present mcod the farmers would welcomeany  system  of control of grain imports.  They realise that  there  is no  chance  of tariffs on grain whatever their own desires may be, nor have they any faith insubsidies or guaranteed  prices-.   I have been advocatingcontrol of  grain  imports hj an Import Board and if wecould poll  the farmers and farm workers of scotland to-day we could easily secure 75 per cent, in favour.12&apos;.    An improvement in  prices before November mightstop  the rot but  I do not think it would be safe totrust to that.    I cannot see anything in the market conditions  except a bad  crop failure this year whichwould bring about the necessary improvement, ana if wehave  a crop failure we shall be almost as bad as we areto-day with the bumper crops.   If nothing can be done to control  grain  imports I am afraid we must face aserious &apos;reduction in the arable area.(Intd.)     J.  D.19th February, 1930-.
