Copy No.   32O.P. 61 (30).                                  CABINET.NATIONALITY  OF  MARRIED WOMEN.       JOINT  MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARIES OF STATE  FOR HOME AND                              FOREIGN AFFAIRS.    THE International Conference on the Codification of International Law is tobe opened at The Hague on the 13th March next.  Delegates  have been appointed torepresent  His Majesty&quot;s  Government in the United  Kingdom and some  of theGovernments of the Dominions will also be represented.   Amongst  the matters forconsideration  by  the  Conference  is the  subject  of  nationality.   No  seriouscontroversial issue is raised except on  one branch of the subject, viz., the nationality of married  women,  which  has been under discussion  in  consultation  with theDominions for some years.  On the 15th April last a depxitation of women&apos;s societieswaited on Mr. Ramsay MacDonald,  when the  official  communique contained thefollowing reference to  the question:-        &quot;With regard  to the question of the  nationality of married women.    Miss  Chrystal MacMillan, of  the Edinburgh Society for Equal  Citizenship;    said that alterations  in the law  were desirable so  that  a  British woman who    marries an alien shall  not automatically lose her nationality; that a foreign    woman who marries a British subject shall not have British nationality imposed    upon  her unless she applies  to be admitted as  a  British subject;  and that a    married woman shall no longer be classified in the nationality laws with minors    and lunatics  as  a  person  under a disability, but shall be deemed competent to    apply for and be admitted to British nationality in her  own right.         &quot;Mr. Ramsay MacDonald said that he agreed with this  proposal.&quot;    A considerable body of enlightened public opinion in the  country would no doubtendorse these views  and  there  would  be no difficulty  in drafting  appropriateinstructions,  but the desirability of giving our delegation  definite instructions inthis  sense depends on the prospect of this policy securing general international agreement.  On  our present information it  is unlikely that this  policy would be generally  accepted at the Conference, for the folloAving reasons :     1. The League have made considerable preparations  for this  Conference. Aslong ago  as March 1928 they sent out a long questionnaire to be filled in by the participating Governments.  After  full  consideration  of the  question  by  an interdepartmental  Committee, the replies of  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  in theUnited Kingdom to this questionnaire were sent to  the League in  November  1928.The  replies  of the various Governments to the questionnaire were  considered by acommittee of  international jurists set up by the League, who drew  up bases ofdiscussion on each of the  principal points.  These bases  represented what theCommittee of Jurists thought to  be the greatest measure  of  agreement likely to be.reached between  the views  of the  different States.  The replies of His Majesty&apos;s;Government to the questionnaire and the relevant bases do  not go nearly so far asthe Women&apos;s  Associations would wish.  The Conference  will,  however,  take  thesebases  as  the starting-point  of  their  deliberations,  and  there  is  bound  to  be considerable surprise if the  delegation of the. United Kingdom entirely abandon the-attitude suggested in the. reply to the questionnaire.       5270   [20642]
2     2. While the views of a certain number of States, such as the United States anblFrance, may, generally  speaking,  coincide with the  aspirations  of  the Women&apos;sAssociations, it is very unlikely that in practice they will go so far as to agree toany considerable departure from  the bases prepared  by the committee of experts.It is known,  on the other hand, that a certain  number of States are strongly opposedto any such policy, and there is no prospect of general agreement  being reached onthe  bases of sex equality in matters of nationality.   It is, indeed,  unlikely thatgeneral agreement will  be  reached at  all  except  on the bases already  prepared.General international acceptance of the  principle involved in any proposed alterationof  the  law  is also essential for  practical  and administrative  reasons.  Unlesscivilised States agree to bring their  law  into  conformity with  the  principle of equality of  the  sexes  in matters of  nationality  cases of dual nationality  andstatelessness  will be multiplied and experience shows that such cases are frequentlythe cause of - international friction.     International agreement will also be necessary in order to settle the principle bywhich the national  status of the  children  is to be determined  in cases where  the parents possess different nationalities.     3. Apart from the lack of agreement with foreign countries, so far as we know the proposals of the women go beyond anything that some of the Dominions would beprepared to agree to, and there is, therefore, the  possibility of different parts of  theEmpire voting against each other at the Conference on a subject in regard to whichuniform action  by all  members  of  the  British  Commonwealth of Nations isparticularly  necessary.   The law of British nationality is the same throughout  theEmpire,  and it  is essential to maintain this  uniformity, which is one of the few remaining  links   holding   together   the   constituent   States   of   the  BritishCommonwealth of Nations.   Any amendment  of  British Nationality law, therefore,requires the concurrence of the Dominions.     A decision is required  whether or  not the delegation of  the  United kingdom should, in the circumstances, press for the policy  advocated by the women&apos;s societies.It is suggested :  (1) That the delegation might  make  it clear that His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  in the United Kingdom are, in principle, in favour of this policy,  butthat at the same time they are bound  to take account of  the practical difficulties$hat would stand in the way of giving effect to the  principle  in the event of itsfailing to find acceptance by the great  majority of States;  and (2) that the extentto which  the delegation  should press  for  the  adoption of this  policy  should  bedetermined in the light of the attitude of other States, and particularly  of  theDominions, as disclosed by the proceedings  of The Hague Conference.     In the event of this policy not finding favour with the Conference (as is probable),discussion  will presumably proceed upon the  Bases  drawn up by the  Committee ofJurists  appointed  by the League.  These Bases  (so  far  as the question of  the nationality of married women is concerned) embody principles which, so far as theygo, are in harmony with the policy advocated by the Women&apos;s Organisations.  the bases are as  follows :      Basis No. 16.         &quot; If the national  law of the  wife causes her  to  lose her nationality  on     marriage with a foreigner this consequence shall be conditional on her acquiring     the nationality of the husband.&quot;     Acceptance of this Basis is recommended by the Interdepartmental Committeeboth on the merits and in view of the probable concurrence  of all  the Dominions inthe proposal.     Basis  No. 17.         &quot; If the national law of the wife causes her to lose her nationality upon a     change  in the  nationality of her husband occurring during marriage,  this     consequence   shall  be   conditional  on  her  acquiring  her  husband&apos;s  new     nationality.&quot;     Acceptance of this Basis is recommended by the. Interdepartmental Committee.This Basis merely applies the principle of Basis  16  to the case where the loss of the wife&apos;s nationality is occasioned by the change  in the husband&apos;s  nationality aftermarriage.  The existing British law enables the  wife  in any such case to avoid  theloss of her British nationality by making a  declaration of her  desire to retain it.
    Basis No. 18.         &quot; Naturalisation of the husband during marriage does not involve a change    of nationality for the wife except with her consent.&quot;    The Interdepartmental  Committee  consider  that  if  general  agreement  is obtained for Bases No. 16 and 17 it is probable that Basis No. 18 might be generallysupported at the Conference on the ground  that the adoption of the Basis withBases No. 16 and 17 would be a reasonable  compromise and that, in that  event, our delegation might support it provided that the Dominions are prepared also to agreeto it.                                                                   *                                                                   J. R. C.                                                                   A.  H.    February 22, 1930.
