THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1930.CONFIDENTIAL.                                             Copy No.     34CP. 74 (30).                                 CABINET.    I CIECULATE to my colleagues the Report from Sir E. Ovey at Moscow.    There  are  obvious  objections either  to publishing it or to withholding  its publication.  If it is laid,  there is always a possibility of the Soviet Governmentstating that Sir E. Ovey is no longer persona grata to them for having reported on a subject which, in their opinion, is one of internal concern.   In that case they wouldbe furnished with the whip-hand for breaking off relations.    I would call especial attention to the private telegram from Sir E. Ovey which follows behind his report.                                                                      A. H.    Foreign Office, March 3, 1930.[N  1390]                            No. 1.             Sir E. Ovey to Mr. A. Henderson. (Received, March 3.)(No. 128.)Sir,                                               Moscow, February 24, 1930.    IN compliance with your  request for a comprehensive  report  on the  allegedatrocities against priests and adherents of the Orthodox Church and  other Churchesin Russia, I shall endeavour in the following paragraphs to present an estimate ofthe  actual situation of Christian and other  churches under the Government of theUnion of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics, which,  from its .outset, has  been avowedlyanti-clerical and anti-religious.   The subject is difficult, delicate  and complicated,involving,  as it does, much of  the  past history and much of the future policy ofRussia. The Church question cannot be separated from the general developmentof the Communist experiment.   It is bound up with the reaction against the Tsaristregime and all its works; it is connected  with the intensified socialisation of the last few months, and especially with the crusade against the kulaks.    2.  But I wish to premise, with some confidence, that the anti-clerical attitudeof the Government, and even the anti-religious propaganda of the Communist partydo not connote &quot; atrocities &quot; in the physical sense.   I have no evidence of any generalshootings of priests as priests, or massacres  of religious congregations.  There hasbeen no return to the thumbscrew-and-rack period of religious  persecution.   Asrecent  questions in Parliament convey an impression that such &quot; atrocities &apos;&apos; havetaken place, it would be of  great assistance to me if I could be put in possession ofthe  material facts in individual cases.    3.  In order to place the church question in its right perspective, it is necessaryto detach one&apos;s mind entirely  from any analogy  with  conditions in Great Britainand to make full allowance for  the following factors in the situation :     (1) The whole effort of the Soviet Government and of  the Communist party is           to put into actual and exclusive practice the theories of Karl Marx, not           only in economic affairs, but in the whole sphere of national life.    (2) Marx&apos;s views on religion are quite explicit;  it is not  merely a harmless           eccentricity, but it is a definite handicap to  that full development of the           reasoning  powers of man, which is the goal of his  &apos;&apos;  materialistic &apos;&apos;           philosophy.  &apos;&apos; Religion  is the Opium o&apos;f the People &apos;&apos;  is the  famous           dictum of Lenin, which now stands engraved on the city wall of Moscow           just opposite the former shrine of the Isversky Madonna.    (3) The Orthodox Church  had come to be regarded as an instrument of  Tsarist           rule.  I quote from Sir Bernard Pares&apos;s  History of  Russia (p. 393) :           &quot; Pobedonostsev was throughout this period  (i.e., reign of Alexander III)      5287   [20723]               &apos;          &apos;                         B
 -    :  :    Procurator of the Holy Synod, 5 the Tsars eye &apos;  to control the Church.           Preachers who expressed themselves at all freely were ordered to send           their sermons in advance to an ecclesiastical censorship.  Village priests           were expected  to  report to  the  police  authorities  those  of  their        *.  parishioners who were  politically untrustworthy.   Every form of dissent           was to be  prescribed; for instance, the Stundists, who resembled  our           Baptists;  the Dukbuhors. who, like our Quakers,  refused military           service; and  the peasant  and other followers of Count Leo  Tolstoy&apos;s           doctrine of non-resistance. .  .  . ,  The non-Orthodox and non-Christian        ,,  communities were all persecuted in the same period.&quot;    (4)  Monasticism had outlived its  period of utility to the people, and existed as           in XVth century England  as a decadent institution with wide territorial           possessions.     (5) Although there were,  and are,  many distinguished and  admirable men           among  the&apos;priests of  the Orthodox Church, yet there was  also great           ignorance  and corruption.  &quot; Pobedonostsev attempted  to  transfer  the           primary schools from the  Zemstva  to the  Church.  Most of the priests           were too ignorant for these duties &quot; (ibid., p] 394).   The story of Rasputin           is in itself sufficient and conclusive evidence of the degradation into which           Court favour and  superstitious ignorance had: dragged the- Church of           St.  Cyril.    (6)  It is logically impossible for the Orthodox Church to give  wholehearted           support to an avowedly anti-religious Government;  it is equally logical           for  the Soviet Government  to regard  the  Church as  a  nucleus of           opposition.    4..   For the historical sequence of  events after  the revolution, I quote againfrom Sir Bernard Pares (op. city, p. 490) :  -         &quot; At the  outset,  the  Bolsheviks raided the  Nevsky Monastery,  and they    sometimes fired on religious processions.  The Patriarch  (Tikhon) had met their    first acts with excommunication,  while at the same time expressly dissociating    the Church from all political parties, and; declaring that it  would save itself by    spiritual arms.  There followed a lull in the persecution, and the Commissary    for Education, Lunacharsky,  even engaged in public debates with the eccentric    Bishop Antonin.   Now, however;  the extremists  launched a-  new  crusade.    Mocking anti-religious processions of the  Communist League of Youth were    organised in Moscow at Christmas 1922;  a trial of Catholic clergy was staged    for the western Easter week of 1923,  and the public mind was prepared for the    trial  of the Patriarch in the week that followed, that  of the Russian Easter.    He had been compelled to suspend his functions, and, on  the initiative of Bishop    Antonin and others of less repute, a number.of - new church  groups were formed    under the protection of the atheistic Government.         &quot;In each of the two  trials the accused were charged with refusal, or    unwillingness to surrender church vessels  as a&quot; contribution  to  famine relief    (though other property  of the churches had been  willingly offered for  this    purpose); but  they were also called upon to give an under taking&apos;to obey a  recent    law  which forbade the teaching&apos; of religion to anyone  under eighteen.   The    significance of this law lay in the systematic efforts which at this time were being-    made by the State to bring up all children as Communists, and, therefore, without    religion.  The Catholic priests were indeed tried, and firmly refused to give  this    pledge; they were all sent to prison; Archbishop Cieplak and Mgr. Budkiewicz ;-) were condemned to death,  and the latter  was executed (March 1923).  But the    general outery in Europe  and America,  together with alarm for the trade    agreement  with  England, so impressed the Communist leaders that the trial of    the Patriarch was postponed.  He was deposed by a packed  Congress of Clergy     in May 1923,  but was later liberated on signing a retraction of hostility to the    Government; after which, the rival groups, such as the &apos; Living Church,&apos; which    never&apos; had any  vitality,  appeared to be  dropped  by the  Communists.   The    persecution which was  directed against all  forms of  religion-Orthodox,    Catholic,   Protestant, Jewish and  Mussulman was  continued  in  less  con- -yd spicuous forms, such as exclusion of Christian children from schools, the deprival v   of priests of all legal status and the exile of the more devoted of the bishops  and    clergy to  the far north  of Siberia,  The Patriarch died,; worn out,  on  the  ;! -&apos;7th April,  1925.  . .  . .  Any regular election of a successor was impossible; but     deputies continued to be appointed and were imprisoned, one after another, by    the Government.&quot;
     Without necessarily endorsing the facts given, and the motives alleged by Sir Bernard Pares in his account of a period anterior by several years to my arrival here, I think that this account by a recognised authority may assist you in under- standing the general development of this question up to the present date.     5.   The predominant factor of the actual situation,  as I have often pointed out in my recent despatches, is the speeding-up, especially during the last six months, of the socialisation (or communisation) of the whole country. The impression which seems to  be pervading Western  Europe  that  a  wave of  intensified  religious persecution is sweeping over Russia, appears to me to have arisen, not so much as the result of specific incidents, but as a distorted (or rather incomplete) reflection of this latest phenomenon.  The real objective of the new  campaign in Russia is the kulak, not the priest; but since the priest is often the friend of the kulak, some of the blows of the Communist drive inevitably fall upon his shoulders.  When kulaks are shot for opposing the Government&apos;^ policy, it may be  that priests are shot,  too; but in such a case they would be suffering  for their political errors and their economic fallacies, rather than for their religious faith. .-,  6.   As regards the purely religious side of the question, there is really no change to record.  The disabilities and disqualifications of the clergy are of long standing, so is the secularisation of education and the rigid  control of church life..  The anti-Christmas demonstrations have been going on since 1922.  The blatant  ridicule showered on  religion in such newspapers as  the &quot; Besbozhnik,&quot; and  the more temperate propaganda  of the anti-religious museums are. nothing new. One well- known monastery was blown up last January for propaganda effect, and in  celebra- tion of the anniversary of the death of  Lenin.  Two other famous monasteries have been recently closed.  Bells have been melted down for metal, and churches have been turned over to secular purposes.  But  this is a process  which  has been continuing over a series  of years,  and is not without its  counterpart  in  the history  of other countries, including our own.     7.   In any purely objective  report on  the state of the relations between  the Soviet Government and the various religious  bodies in Soviet Russia, including the Orthodox Church, it  is  necessary  to  distinguish between  the actual legislation promulgated *n the form of decrees by the  Soviet authorities, and the propaganda of the Communist party directed towards the gradual abolition of all religious ideas in the native mentality.    8.   The Government have not, as will be seen, issued decrees or laws designed to render the practice  of religion a criminal offence.   On  the  contrary,  however restrictive the legislation may be,  it is actually designed so as to permit  the con- tinuance of religion under certain very definite conditions.   A proof of this exists in the fact that a considerable number of churches are  open, and services are legally. freely and regularly held therein.    9.  To an enquiry why so many churches had been closed, the Soviet reply would be that their number was clearly superfluous, and that sufficient had been left open to supply the needs of those desiring to  exercise their religion.  A Soviet spokesman might add that churches are closed for two reasons :     (1)  As may occur in any country when the site is required for such purposes as           street-widening; and    (2)  When a report is received from local Communists to the effect that, whereas           the church as a religious building is only used by quite a few people, it           would, if  secularised and used as a club or meeting-place,  be of great           advantage to the  majority of the  commune.    10.   In such cases,  I understand, the evicted congregation are free to hire other premises for purposes of devotion.  For instance, at Minsk, which has a considerable Jewish population, I am informed that  the principal synagogue  has been secularised because the local authorities  considerd  it to be unnecessarily large for its religious purpose, but that the Jewish community is not prevented from hiring a room for the practice of their cult.    11.   It would be as difficult as it would be invidious for me to attempt to lay down .any opinion as to the extent to which these local communities act entirely ontheir own volition in demanding the secularisation, of  the churches.  In some cases,however, it is reasonable to suppose that the majority of the  people definitely desirethe change:      [20723]                                                        B 2
       12.   The aptual legislation regulating the practice of, religion in this country-  is embodied in Debreie No,:&apos; 8.58 of the 8th April, .1929, a translation of which was  enclosed&apos; in my despatch No. 110 of the 14th February.; In this decree the principal  points are as follows : -       (a). Every religious society lor group  has to register, and  such society can only.           -.. be attended by persons over the age of 18 years.       (&amp;) These societies must consist of at least twenty people.       (c) Any number of people unable to  form a society of twenty have the right to             form a religious group, but neither these societies, nor these groups, have          .   any judicial rights.                      -      &apos;       (d)  These societies have a right to lease free of charge from the town, or             province, or district executive committees premises for  the purpose of             prayer, as also the liturgical  appurtenances necessary for the carrying-             out of their religious rites.       (e)  The general meetings of the society  can only  be held  after special sanction             has been obtained from the relevant executive committee.       (/) Religious associations are forbidden to create mutual  credit societies or             co-operatives, or to use their building for other than religious purposes,             or to give material assistance to  their members; nor may they organise             special  prayer meetings  for children, young people, or women, such as             literary  gatherings,  or sewing meetings  for  the  purpose  of teaching             religion.       (g) Religious societies are only  allowed to make voluntary collections for the             upkeep of their  edifices;  they may not make any forced collection, or             contribution in aid of religious organisations;  they may not collect any             central fund or conclude any-form of contract or sale.  They have not the             rights of a juridical person.       (h)  While it is the policy of the Soviet Government to separate religion entirely             from Government schools and   Government education,  and  while  no             religious  observance or  service  is permitted  in  any State,  public, or             private institution, special permission may be given to allow religious             rites to be administered at the request of a dying  person, or, in cases of             serious illness, in a hospital or prison,  but in such cases, the religious             service must be held in a specially isolated apartment.       (i) Religious observances at cemeteries, or in  crematoria, are, of course, also             permitted.  (Indeed, funeral processions form quite as common a sight in             the streets of Moscow as in any other  capital.)       (j) Religious processions outside the bounds of a religious building and  its             premises  are only permitted after  preliminary   agreement  with the             Executive Committee of the district in which they are held.   For religious             services in connection Avith funerals no special permit is required.*       (k) Religious associations failing to  register will be closed.       13.  Besides the legislation specifically aimed  at the control  of religion,  it   should be observed that priests and church officials  have been assigned to that class   of the community which is known as the &quot;Lishienchi,&quot; or those deprived of civic   rights.  For instance, the law of the Constitution of  the R.S.F.S.R.  (the 11th May,   1925) includes among  disqualified  persons &quot; monks and  clerics of  all religious   denominations.&apos;&apos;  A  decree  of the  Presidium of the VTSIK (the 28th February,*  1927) enumerates the whole category of religious persons by name, including monks.   lay.brotb.ers, priests, deacons, choristers, mullahs, muezzins, rabbis, cantors, shamans,   Catholic priests, bible teachers,  and other  professional religious persons, whether   or no  they  receive  money  for  their religious activities.   Priests,  therefore, and   prominent believers  of all faiths, are in  the same category as ex-business men, ex-   bourgeois, ex-officials  of  the Tsarist regime, former Tsarist military and  naval   officers, former  Tsarist  police  and  kulaks  (rich peasants)- those,  in fact,  whose   activities are considered to be, or to have been, harmful to the welfare of the State.   Such persons are deprived of the right of voting.  Further, they are not allowed to   enjoy the advantage of ration-cards and other arrangements made for the regular   and organised provision of food  to persons employed,  directly or indirectly, in State   reconstruction.  This latter disability has been imposed upon them, so I  am informed,   for about a  year and a half.  It implies that they have to buy  all food and provisions   -at the highest prices, or go without.   This disability has, within the last few months,   been extended to housing space, at any rate in Moscow,.where  the housing question is   very acute.  Here, the &quot;Lishienchi &quot; are deprived of that right to a given area  of
 dwelling-room, to which all other Soviet, citizens are &apos;.by law-1 en titled. ... ^Further  by-ordinance of the Presidium  of the Moscow Soviet of the 31st July, 1929, /dealing with the ejection  from&quot; their dwellings  Of non-Workers&apos; ahcl&apos; former house-owners), they are liable to be turned out oi rooms actually inhabited by them, if the space is required by a citizen-of the privileged classes.  As a --result, -1 am informed that about half of the &quot; Lishienchi &quot; class  have left Moscow, drifting  either into the country or to other towns where the pressure is less severe.  About half have made their peace with the Soviet authorities by being  able to prove that they  are engaged in activities useful to the  State. But very few priests are to be found in this latter more fortunate category, since, in order to make terms with the authorities,, they would probably be required to abjure their religious faith and to find secular employment.  This means that in all probability a number of priests have had to leave Moscow, since there is no place here where they can find lodging.  I am told, however, that some of them are living  in their church buildings,  and that some are taken in  as guests in the rooms of charitable people.  This  is not illegal.    14.  I think  it may be fairly adduced from the  foregoing  paragraphs that, although  special  regulations have  been made for the control of religion in this country, yet  churches  are  open,  services are held, priests may function and even preach sermons, and the faithful may freely attend;  also that, although priests and other ministers of religion suffer from serious disabilities,  their treatment is  not wholly discriminatory, since they form but one  part of a whole class of disfranchised and disqualified persons;  and, finally,  that there are no &quot;atrocities,&quot; no  massacres and no religious persecution in the mediaeval sense of the term.  The  oppression and suppression of religion in Russia has (in recent years, at least) been of a  slow-motion character, and executions of priests and believers which have from time to time taken place have been punishment for political intrigues against the State, the  justice of which  it is hardly the business of another State officially to appraise.    15.  In paragraph 7 above, I emphasised the necessity of distinguishing between the actual legislation of the  Soviet authorities and the propaganda of  the Communist party.   The latter unquestionably aims at eradicating all religious ideas out of the mind of the  Russian  people,  but by  instruction,  example and ridicule, not  by forcible persecution or by physical violence.   The Government,  of course, does  not disfavour such propaganda; on the contrary, they have reversed the usual  practice of countries  where clericalism is dominant,&apos; in  that the  only propaganda  allowed is anti-religious propaganda.  Anti-Government, propaganda is, of course,  severely punished.  Propaganda by  instruction can be  studied by any visitor to Moscow in the so-called anti-religious  museums.   The  most important of these is housed  in the former Strastnoi Convent, and. the. exhibits appear to indicate two principal lines of approach to the subject :     (1) Demonstration  that all religions equally have developed from nature myths           and popular superstition, and are equally illusory and contemptible; and    (2) Demonstration  that the Orthodox Church in particular  was utilised by  the           Tsarist Government as  a means of oppressing  the people and as an           adjunct to militarism.    Although a small charge is made for entering the museum,  it is well attended, and official lecturers explain the significance of the exhibits. Another small anti- religious museum is attached to the (secularised) Cathedral of  Vassili Blazhenni. Here, one of  the principal slogans  displayed on the wall is to the effect that in  the abolition of religion as  the  source of the imaginary happiness of the people will  be discovered the foundation of their real happiness.    16.  Propaganda  by example  may be found in the ruling of the  Communist party that no party member may be a believer in,.or adherent of, any religious faith whatsoever.  The same stipulation holds good  of the Young Communists&apos;  organisa- tions (the Consomols) and the children&apos;s organisation (the Pioneers).  Propagandaby ridicule may best be observed  in such papers as the &quot; Besbozhnik &quot; (Atheist), to:which  I have referred  above.  The humour is  crude and frankly offensive.  Of the,same type  are the popular  processions  and  demonstrations,  which for some  years have regularly been held  on the  great Church festivals, especially  Easter  andChristmas.   These are usually organised by the  Young  Communists&apos; organisations,,and are willingly tolerated, if not actively encouraged, by the  Soviet  authorities.Grotesque representations of Bible scenes are  paraded on placards or in  tableaux;yicons are publicly burned, and files.of devout unbelievers spit on crucifixes and other,religious objects.
j,   17.  By,these and similar means, the atheistic element in Soviet Russia-and itji^ all-powerful in the high places of the party is confident that, with a generationor two,-it, can stamp out religion among  the people without having to take in hand the double-edged sword  of persecution.   I cannot attempt to prophesy whether theywill be successful or not.   My  personal experience is that  the young  people of moscow are not interested in religious questions j and I was struck by; the remark ofa child of 5 or 6, who commented to a member of my staff on the number of icons inthe room of one of., the  women-servants in a neighbouring house :  &quot; Why does shewant them? &quot; he said; &quot; everyone knows there is no God ! -&quot;    18.  In the course  of  this despatch, I have necessarily been mainly concernedwith the position of the Orthodox Church.  This is, of course, the principal Churchin  Russia.  The Metropolitan  Sergius, in his interview  with  the foreign press correspondents, given as an enclosure to my despatch No: 12.9  of the 24th February,states that it still numbers some tens of millions of adherents.   There is also a largeCatholic community,  chiefly in the Ukraine and on the borders of Poland.  I  am informed that a very high percentage of the Catholic clergy are in exile, principallybecause of  their stand against the withdrawal of children  from religious education.Then,  there is the Uniate  community, which  acknowledges the supremacy of the pope, but preserves many of the Orthodox rites.  There  are Lutherans-principallyamong settlers of German and Swedish origin. There are Protestant sects, holdingthe most diverse doctrines.   There are Armenians and Jews, and Mohammedans andBuddhists  and Zoroastrians  and  Shamanists and  other varieties of  religiousbelievers within the  vast  boundaries  of the  Soviet territory.   Towards  all thesefaiths, the attitude of the Soviet authorities is one and the same, viz., that they are all  equally futile and reactionary;  their priests and religious leaders are deprived of  civic rights, and their communities are politically suspect.   The  Jews areforbidden their Sabbath lights, just as the Christians are forbidden to ring theirchurch bells, and there  is,  so I have read, a hygienic campaign in progress for the suppression of the rite of circumcision.   Politically, however,  the Soviet authoritiesare anxious to find a satisfactory  solution of  the  Jewish question created by the elimination of the trading communities of the towns.  Agricultural settlements forJews have been started, and there is some idea of the possibility of founding a Jewishautonomous  State.   As  regards  the  position  of  Mohammedanism  and  other non-Christian confessions, I am not in a position to submit any definite information,but I  would  direct your attention to  the  final sentence of the -following recentsummary  of the situation  in  the German review &quot; Ost-Europa &quot;  (February 1930,p. 337) :-         &apos;&apos; The struggle against Church and religion is carried on more keenly, but    also in a more nervous manner.  Here is the unsatisfactory nature of the results    most  clearly shown.  This year Christmas celebrations were for the first time    officially forbidden.  The new working week (i.e., the five-day week) went calmly    on across the  25th  December; four-fifths of the people had to be at work.  So    the 25th  December was declared to be the &apos; Second Day  of  Industrialisation.&apos;    On the 22nd  December the  ancient and famous cave monastery of Kieff was    closed; on the 31st the almost equally famous Alexander-Nevski Monastery  in    Leningrad.  The former  was made into a .Communist Club, the latter into a    Communist Academy.  More and more churches  are shut  and  changed into    cinemas,  &amp;c, and church bells must disappear throughout the land.   Here the    radicalisation in 1 Stalinisinus&apos; is striking its hardest blows against the most    intimate  feelings of mankind.  It is aiming especially against the old  Greek    Orthodox  Church,  then against Judaism,  and now  with vigour against  the    Catholic  Church, but  against  Islam not  as yet with  the  same ruthlessness  as    against the other confessions.&quot;    I  should  add that perhaps a strong potential  weapon by which the localauthorities are enabled to bring  pressure to bear  upon churches and  religiouscommunities is that  of taxation.  The  same ,method  has also been reported to  befrequently used against the kulaks.  A demand for taxation,  for instance, is  made,arbitrarily  fixed  at  an amount which the community  is unable  to  pay.   Thecommunity may then forfeit its church and church furnitures, and, if it can continue at all, must survive on the sufferance of its enemies.    19.  The above estimate of the position is &quot;based upon  the personal  observationand reading of myself and members of my staff, and upon conversations Avith people who, from a longer residence  in this  country, have had  more  opportunity to collate^
the facts and to form opinions on their significance.1  I must repeat once again thatwe are here on very delicate ground, that we are dealing with a country which has at no time in its history been familiar with the ideal of religious toleration, that thepresent Government and its supporters are convinced that the material disadvantages of religious faith outweigh its spiritual consolations, that their policy is to secularisethe thought of the people, that they unquestionably exert to this end  a degree of pressure  which offends  our modern ideas of tolerance, but that they stop  short onthe fringe of persecution by violence, that their anti-religious policy is  a part, anda part only, of their comprehensive scheme for building up an entirely new country on entirely new lines, and that any. interference from abroad in what they regard asthe internal affairs of the Soviet Union would not only  be met with very generalresentment, but might quite possibly tend to increase the hardships and sufferings ofthat very class of people whose lot it was designed to alleviate.                                                      I have, &amp;c.                                                           ESMOND OVEY.                                    No. 2.            Sir E. Ovey to Mr. A. Henderson. (Received March 2.)(No.  102.   Private and Confidential.)(Telegraphic.)                                         Moscow, March 1, 1930.    FOLLOWING for Mr. Oliphant :-        &quot; From imperfect information here, I am not able to judge as to whether    Secretary of State may feel it incumbent on him or not to publish my report on    religious question.        &quot; I need hardly say that  I urgently hope publication may be avoided.        &quot; Even if report were considered in England to be pro-Soviet, newspaper    criticisms to that effect  would hardly help the situation  here.   On  the other    hand,  Russian press could hardly  in  any case  avoid some criticism of my    criticisms which  would render my position here  very delicate.        &quot; Matter is,  of course, entirely  for &quot;Secretary of State to decide,  and I am    willing to stand any racket if necessary, but I venture to point out that there    appear to be objections even from point of view of international [ ? precedent].        &quot; Please take any action  that may commend  itself to you on above private    and personal view, and telegraph me as soon as possible any definite decision.&quot;o
