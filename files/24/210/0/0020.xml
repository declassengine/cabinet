THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                     Printed for the Cabinet.  February  1930.CONFIDENTIAL.                                            Copy  No.   32CP. 70 (30).                                 CABINET.    I CIRCULATE for the consideration of my colleagues a memorandum in regard to accommodation for His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Moscow.                                                                     A. H.    Foreign Office, February 28, 1930.                              MEMORANDUM.    THE house at Moscow which is at present held on an annual lease, expiring atthe end of July next, at a rental of approximately  2,500 per annum, is the one whichwas occupied by Sir Robert  Hodgson, and a staff of  nine or more  people, from1921-27.   It contains only 13 rooms, and the staff of the Mission in Sir R. Hodgson&apos;s time was  terribly crowded, and existed under conditions of great discomfort.    Sir E. Ovey therefore considered, before going out to Moscow, that it wouldbe quite impossible for him to crowd all his staff into the present house. He there-fore allowed the members of the clerical staff, now numbering six, to have residential accommodation there, and the  remaining rooms are used as offices.   Sir  E. Oveyhimself,  with the three  members  of  the diplomatic  staff  and  two commercialdiplomatic  officers, are at present living  in the Savoy  Hotel until more suitable accommodation can be acquired for the whole staff.    Early  in  January Sir E.  Ovey  reported  that  the  Soviet Government wereprepared to place at his  disposal the Charitonenko House  at  a  rental of  4,500 ayear, together with eviction compensation of  20,000,  which could,  with suitablealterations,  estimated to cost about  10,000, be made to accommodate the wholestaff.  These proposals were put  before the Office of Works, who  at first objectedstrongly  to  the proposed payment of  20,000 for eviction compensation, on  theground that the whole of that expenditure wrould be wasted in the event of the with-drawal  of  the  Embassy. The  Office  of Works  suggested  that  the  evictioncompensation, instead of being paid in a lump sum, should be spread over the whole period of the lease, and authorised their  representative to make the following offer for the  Charitonenko House:  rent,   7,000 per  annum;  eviction compensation, 5,000.   The Soviet authorities  refused to modify their demand for   20,000 evictioncompensation, and Sir E.  Ovey is now waiting  to hear whether  these  terms can beagreed to.    The  First Commissioner of Works is now prepared to  defend the acceptance ofthe terms demanded by the Soviet Government if  the Cabinet decide that  they  canbe accepted, having regard to existing political conditions and the prospect of the embassy  remaining permanently in Moscow.  The Office of Works  point out in thememorandum attached to this  paper that if the mission is likely to be  retainedpermanently there would be a case for paying  the heavy  premium demanded andfor spending large sums  on alterations,  but that if there is any  prospect  of  themission being withdrawn  money so spent would be largely wasted.    There is no doubt that the accommodation provided in the Charitonenko House(together with the retention of  the present house)  would be much more satisfactorythan the existing arrangement under which the Ambassador, the  diplomatic and thecommercial diplomatic staffs live  in an hotel.  The cost, as shown in the  Office of    5282  [20710]
2Works memorandum, will be approximately  400 a year more  than at present,apart from additional charges for rates, heating, &amp;c, the amount of which wouldprobably come to &quot; several thousand pounds a year.&quot;    A tabular statement is attached showing the rents paid for the French, italian and Japanese Embassies as compared with those proposed for the British Embassy.

OFFICE OF WORKS MEMORANDUM.                 Accommodation for British Mission in Moscow.    I.  The Mission consists of the following :             Foreign Office--                 Ambassador.                 Counsellor.                 2  Secretaries.                 5  Clerical Officers.                 2  Chancery Servants.                 1  Vice-Consul to be appointed.            Department of Overseas Trade                  Commercial Secretary.                 A junior Commercial Secretary.    Accommodation is therefore necessary for twelve members of the Mission andtwo Chancery Servants; in addition, there are the usual personal servants.    2.  Five of the junior staff are at present housed in a building held on an annualtenancy at the rent  of  2,500 per annum.   The remainder live in an hotel, and aregiven rent allowances, which, including the two members to be appointed, will amountto  6,600 per annum.   The total cost  of  the Mission for  rent and allowances  can therefore be taken roughly at  9,000 per annum.    3.  The Soviet Government have  offered to lease a large building, known asCharitonenko  House.  On present information it should be possible to Obtain a20-year lease at a rent of  4,500 per annum.    The building is a fine one and in good condition.  It could provide quarters forthe Ambassador, the Counsellor and two Secretaries; Chancery accommodation; andquarters for eight  junior staff.  This would leave over unaccommodated the  twoCommercial Secretaries and the Vice-Consul, who could  continue to  occupy theexisting house or cheaper alternative accommodation  if it is available.
    In  addition: to. the, rent,  the Soviet Government are. asking for a premium of, 20,000 for possession, put forward as compensation for dispossessed tenants.    Adaptations to the building to provide for the Ambassadors quarters, Chancery,accommodation, separate  residential  quarters for the  staff, &amp;o, will cost, roughly, 10,000.    The comparison of the cost of the scheme with present costs is as  follows:                                Per Annum.Cost of Charitonenko House -                Rent     ..      ..      ..      ..    4,500  Premium and alterations =  30,000    Interest at 5 per cent.    ..       ..    1,500   Sinking fund at 4 per  cent, over 20     years ..      ..      ..       ..     990                                                                            6,990.                                           Addx Rent of present house ..      ..    2,500                                                      Approximately       ..    9,500    (N.B. In  any comparison of cost  it must be borne in mind that,  whilst the        allowances now being paid no doubt cover rates, heating, lighting and use        of furniture, the rental costs  under  the  proposed arrangement must be        loaded to provide for similar services.  The data to make such a calculation        are not available, but the additional costs are likely to amount to several        thousand pounds a year.)    There is a serious housing shortage in Moscow.   Other Missions  have had to accommodate their staff in a number of separate buildings.  If Charitonenko house is not acquired it will be necessary to continue the present arrangements whereby the majority of the staff live in hotels.    If the Mission is likely  to be retained permanently there would be  a case forpaying the heavy premium demanded and  for  spending large sums on alterations.If there is any prospect of the Mission  being withdrawn, money so spent would be largely wasted.    Up to the present the Soviet Government have refused to reduce the  amount of 20,000 premium.  If the negotiations are to go on, the principle and the amountmust be accepted  as a basis for further discussion, in which it might be possible toget slightly better terms.  Authority is required to proceed with the&apos; negotiations onthis basis.              Present  Cost.      Per Annum.
