HIS BRITAflNIO m-JESTY fS , GOVBRMMEMT) .RET.,99 (30) .COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURAL POLICYCopy of a letter to the Prime Minister from the Chairman,          ombodylng interim recommendations.To the Right Honourable     James Ramsay Mac dona Id, M.P.,          Prime Minister, First Lord of the Treasury.Sir,     1.   The Committee appointed by the decision of the cabinets on the 11th March 1930, to consider certain papers on agricultural policy, have held six meetings.     2.   The Committee are unanimously of the opinion            that the organised marketing of home-grown produce            by a co-operative method would be to the advantage            of arable farmers, as well as to the general advantage            of the agricultural Industry in Great Britain.          The Committee accordingly recommend that the Governmentshould adopt the Agricultural Marketing Bill.     3.   The Committee, however, wish to make it clear that thoestablishment of a marketing organization would not meet theproblem raised by the present depression of cereal prices and in the opinion of some of the members further measures arenecessary.   The Committee have therefore considered the twopolicies:-      (I)  for requiring by legislation the milling of a proportion          of home grown wheat by all British mills,   and    (ii)  for the creation of a state monopoly for the          bulk .purchase of grain and/or control of British flour mills^Cabinet 14(50)  Conclusion 1
          The problems presented by these two policiesare so large that up to the present the Committee are notable to reach such a degree of agreement as to enable themto submit a recommendation to the Government.   they accordingly propose to continue their investigation of  these problems with the hope of being able to make a further  Reportby Tuesday,, the 25th March 1930 *                    I am, etc .
