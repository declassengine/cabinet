Memorandum by the Minister of itgriculture                             and Fisheries.     1.      I submit, for the consideration of my colleagues9proposals     for the assistance of British growers of wheat.     2.      In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on 5th March     (Cabinet 13 (3q) conclusion 5 (b) I have set out (Appendix I) the     plan of an Import Board for wheat and flour which formed an     important feature of the Labour party&apos;s polioy for agriculture.     It has been necessary to modify the original proposal so as to     comply with observations received from the President of the     Board of Trade to the effect that any State or other monopoly     which applies to the importation of commodities into this     country must, if it is to conform with our international     obligations, apply equally to home produce.     3.      It was originally intended that the home producer should     be benefited by receiving advance information as to the figure     at which the Import Board would stabilise tho selling price of     imported produce.  The British farmer was, however, to be left     free to sell his crop as he thought fit.  This feature of the     original proposal has been found to be impossible under our     international obligations and the scheme described in Appendix I     accordingly provides for the Import Board being the sole purchaser     of the home wheat crop of milling quality as well as the sole     importer of all wheat and wheat flour.     4.      I have carefully considered whether the agricultural     advantages which could be secured by the establishment of an     Import Board could be obtained by setting up a wheat marketing     Board to purchase and sell the home crop only.  This
proposal, as described in Appendix II, though administrativelynot simple,  avoids the immense complications of the ImportBoard.  The financial risks would be very much smaller and theamount of fixed capital required would be negligible. It wouldalso avoid the whole of the international difficulties which ithas frequently been stated would be Involved in the establishmentof an Import Board. Moreover, the scheme for the creation of awheat marketing Board under the Agricultural Marketing Bill is a purely domestic due1, leaving our relations with other countries and the Dominions, as well as our import trade and our entrepottrade unaffected.5. I am, therefore, of opinion that the best means of improving the position of British growers of wheat will be by means of awheat marketing Board as mentioned in the preceding paragraph,coupled with a statutory requirement that millers should include in their grists a prescribed proportion of home-grown wheat.This proposal has the additional advantage that whereas theestablishment of an Import Board would necessitate a separate bill, the home crop only could be dealt with in the manner suggested by an extension of the Agricultural Marketing Bill.The present low level of wheat prices and the general lack ofconfidence among British farmers in the future prospect of wheatgrowing render It essential, if an effort is to be made to relieve the present depression, that some financial assistance should be provided by the State, even though it were of atemporary character.  The present depression among cereal growersis practically world wide, but whereas wheat producers in nearly every other country in Europe and In many outside Europe, areprotected by tariffs or assisted by sps cial legislation, nosimilar steps have so far been taken in Gt.Britain. The present position
 in the industry is suGh that I am confident that neither an Import Board not a marketing Board for home-grown wheat would stand the slightest prospect of being accepted by farmers if such proposal were based on existing market prices. 6.      I,  therefore, recommend that the British growers of wheat should be allowed by organisation and contingent financial assistance to secure 50s.  a quarter for wheat of good milling quality purchased by the Marketing Board.  The cost of this proposal to the Exchequer assuming that the total production  of wheat in Great Britain remains unaltered would not exceed  1^- million per annum. 7.      It will bo remembered that under the Com Production Act, 1917 (as amended by the Agriculture Act, 1920) prices were guaranteed for both wheat and oats and that the cost proved so great that the Act had to be repealed, payment for only one year being made on the basis of  3 an acre for wheat and  4 for oats. The guaranteed prices were, however, at that time placed at exceedingly high figures.  Moreover, the payment was to be made on an acreage basis.  The proposals now submitted are quite different. In the first placo, the price suggested is estimated to be no more than is sufficient to cover the cost of production on land now devoted to wheat.  Secondly, tho payment will not be on acreage but on production and limited to grain of milling quality.  Moreover, the Marketing Board would be in a position to define the range of milling quality it would accept, and to refuse to accept wheat of certain kinds.  Ib would thus be able to exert a valuable influence over farm practice and to secure improvements as regard varieties grown, grading and similar matters. 8.      I hope, therefore, that it may be found practicable to authorise me to announce that the Government has decided to introduce legislation with a view to the establishment of a Marketing Board to deal with the home wheat crop coupled with a  statutory quota for millers and contingent financial assistance. The details of  the scheme  to be worked out with  a view to the preparation of  tho necessary addition  to the Agricultural Marketing Bill  for submission  to  the Cabinet  Committee concerned..  .                                                  N.B.mistry  of Agriculture and Fisheries.       8th March,1930.
                      APPENDIX I.                                J02               IMPORT BOARD FOR WETJAT AND FLOUR.Scope  and.  Functions  of the  Import Board.(I)  The Import Board  should have the  sole right of  purchasing-    home  grown wheat  as well  as  wheat  for import.(2)  The Import Board  should have power to issue licences  to  trade    in re-exported  cargoes at its discretion.      -           ,(5)  The appropriate Ministers should  he  responsible  for the  appoint-    ment  of members of such Import Board for a  term of ye-irs, but    should have power to require resignation.   The majority  of  the    persons should  be selected from trade,  financial,  agricultural  or    other Experts-; Definite  provision should be made  for    representation  of the Co-operative Movement.  The  Minister    of Agriculture  should on  the analogy of the Broadcasting    Corporation bo  answerable to Parliament for policy, but  not for    business details  of transactions.(4)  The Import Board  would have  a seal and  would trade as  a    responsible business organisation using as  far  as  possible  the    existing trade  channels and  machinery.  It  would have  the rights    of purchasing,  selling, and  generally operating  as a business    concern.(5),  The Import Board  would be required to carry on  its operations    of import so  far  as practicable without a profit or loss averaged    over  reasonable periods of years,  but subject to this, it would    be required to  keep prices steady on the British market  for as    long  periods  as possible.(6 ) The Import Board  should be guaranteed a sufficient capital  by    the Treasury  for  its operations,  and be required to present to    Parliament annually audited  balance  sheets  and  full details of    its transactions, so far  as  such  disclosure is  not commercially    harmful.            It is impossible  to  give  any precise estimate  of the    capital which might be required in order to finance the  operations
of the Import Board.  Sir Warren Fisher, in a report to the PrimeMinister, has expressed the opinion that it would not be safe toestimate the sum needed to acquire the concerns now&quot; engaged in thetrade, including flour mills, and to provide the necessary working capital at less than from  35 to  40 millions.  It is not, however,proposed to acquire the concerns now engaged in the trade, nor is itcontemplated that the setting up of an Import Board, will necessitateany direct interference with flour mills.  If the Board made full useof existing financial and commercial facilities associated with thepurchase,insurance, shipment, importation and distribution of wheat,it would not sppear, from the experience of the Wheat Commissionduring the War, necessary to provide more than  5 or  6 million for working capital.  Additional sums would, however, be necessary inorder to finance any adverse balance arising in the course of theBoard1s operation towards stabilisation and also any supplies of grain which, it may be decided to hold in store in the national interest.The amount of the additional sums would dopend on the policy pursued.Operations to be limited to purchoso and sale of wheat and importedflour.        As the Import Board would be the sole importer of wheat and flour and the sole purchaser of the home crop so far as it is ofmilling  quality, comprehensive arrangements would have to be made bythe Board for disposal to the milling trade.  It would not, however,be necessary to tako statutory powers to control the milling industry,nor is it proposed to exercise any direct control over the bakingtrade or the ssle of other cereals or offals.Purchase of Home-C-rown Whoat.        In the Labour Party&apos;s proposal it was intended that the home producer would benefit by being given advance information as to theprice at which the Import Board would stabilise the price of importedtvhoat, the home farmor being left free to sell his produce as hethought fit.  In order, however, to meet our international obligationsit will be necessary to extend to the home grown crop the monopolywhich it was proposed to give to the Import Board.
        The function of the Board in relation to the home crop would, therefore, be to announce in advance the price which it is prepared to pay for home produce according to grade, such price to be based on the Board&apos;s selling price, having regard to the estimated cost of imported produce, the Board aiming at making neither profit nor loss on its transactions over a long period, Preferential Price to Homo Growers.        The Labour party&apos;s policy did not contemplate the payment of a preferential price to home growers.  In view however of the present situation in regard to wheat growing in this country a price above the level of general world prices would have to be guaranteed to British farmers if the recent decline in wheat growing is to be arrested.  There would be no difficulty in combining with the Import Board scheme a proposal for a guaranteed price for the home crop.        The Board would announce in advance each year the preferential price it was prepared to pay for home gi^own wheat, the additional cost of which above the parity of world prices would have to be voted by parliament and placed at the disposal of the Import Board by the Exchequer.        It would be necessary in the Bill to make provision, as was done in the Agriculture Act, 1920, for fixing andvarying from time to time the preferential price payable for the home crop, such preferential price disappearing, of course, during periods when world prices are at a level equal to the estimated cost of production in this country.The preferential price suggested for the home crop of goodmilling quality is 50/- per quarter of 504 lbs.   On the basis of the present market price and the average production Inthe last few years this guarantee  would involve  an expenditure by the State  not exceeding  3 million per annum.
              APPENDIX. II.Scheme for organising the marketing of  thehome wheat crop, associated with (l) a statutory quota of home wheat in millingand (2) contingent financial assistance.     1.   The essential  purpose of the  scheme  is to organise&apos;home wheat producers permanently for marketing their crop,  andto provide a permanent  assured market  for home milling wheatat a remunerative price *     2.   It Is  necessary  to  Introduce  two fundamental changesin the present  system ofs&amp;rketing home grown  wheat     (l) To set up a statutory wheat marketing board under  the     Agricultural Marketing  Bill which board  and  its agents will     be the sole intermediary between  farmer  and  miller.     (2) To reqiire British  mills to include  a minimum     proportion (hereafter referred to as the &quot;statutory quota&quot;)     of home grown wheat  in  all their  gristings.     (3) The wheat marketing board  will  be  required to purchase     from farmers all home grown wheat of mlllable quality.     It will define the f.a.q.  (fair average  quality) standard     of English milling wheat for each season, fixing price     differences for varying grades, and it will  decline  to     accept wheat&quot; of non-millable grades.   A  grower whose  wheat is     not accepted by the  board  will be free to dispose of  it     elsewhere.     (4) The powers of  this  board will make it a  valuable     influence for good in (l)  farming practice,  by fostering     the cultivation of the  best milling varieties of  wheat and     in reducing the number  of  varieties grown,  and  (2) In     marketing practice by defining f.a.q.  (fair  average  quality)     standards for varying grades,  and by  introducing orderly     marketing of supplies.
(5)  The fixing, by the responsible Minister,  of a statutoryand variable quota of home produced wheat  to be  used inmilling will secure a definite market for  all millable.wheat.(6)  The board,  as a le,rge co-o:;erative organisation of producers, would be allowed to use its concentratedbargaining power to secure from millers a  remunerative price,which,  at the present time, would be a premium over the normalprice parity of  imported wheat in the United kingdom.   TheI.linister&apos;s power to vary the statutory quota downwards canbe exercised if  the selling price exceeded parity by a specified premium (say, 10/- per qr.)  or  in the event ofthe selling price exceeding, say, 45/- per quarter, whichever is the  lower.  The maximum premium will only be  payable bymillers when the world price of wheat is lowest;   the premium will diminish as wheat increases in value,  and thusany possibility of the premium affecting the price of breadcan only arise when bread prices are low.(7)  It is, however, certain that the proposals  to establish a home  wheat marketing board, and a statutory quota, althoughfundamental and  beneficial reforms from the farmer&apos;s point ofview, will not suffice, in the present depressed condition ofagriculture, to  secure for them acceptanco from the agricultural industry, unless they are accompanied b-rsome measure  of temporary financial assistance.        As protective import duties on wheat are barred,  this assistance can only be provided by an Exchequer  grant;  itis preferable that it should be a fixed sum, so  that theExchequer liability may be known beforehand.(8)  It is proposed that the board shall be granted  1,250,000to be voted annually by Parliament for a limited term  of years.This sum will enable the board to pay to producers a price
exceeding parity-by at least 5/- per quarter for millable wheat, based on present average production.   provision should be made for the suspension or. variation of theTreasury contribution when the farmers price exceeds 50/- per quarter.         The board should secure from millers an additionalpremium over parity of at least another 5/-  per quarter,and it will be open to them to secure a higher premiumprovided that if it reaches 10/- per quarter or if the average price that they sell to millers exceeds 45/- for f.a.q.  (fairaverage ouality) milling wheat, the Minister can exercise his power to reduce the statutory quota and thus prevent an unduerise of price.(9)  The consumer is protected by the following safeguards    (a) English wheat on the average forms less than 20 percent, of the millers gristings.  A rise of  10/- in itsprice means an average of not more than 2/-  for the totalgristings, a figure that should not be reflected in the price of flour to an oxtent likely to influence noticeably theprice of the loaf.    (b)  The Minister will have power to reduce the statutoryquota.    (c)  The competition of imported flour is a check upon any attempt of millers to raise flour prices unfairly.(^)  The proposals are likely to be acceptable to millersprovided they aro accompanied by either,  -    (1) a requirement that imported flour shall, onimportation, be admixed with a quota of all  English wheat flour corresponding to the statutory quota imposed uponmillers, or   (2) if this is found to be impracticable, that a smallregistration fee be imposed on imported flour;  it mightbe about 2/- per sack of 280 lbs.
