S DOCUiVlBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAjffilG MAJESTY1 SGOVERNMENT.4OBET. 75&quot;1( 30)COPY No.,,CABINETINDIAN COTTON DUTIES.     Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     As I shall not be able to be at the cabinet when theMemorandum CP.49(30) circulated by the Secretary of Statefor India with regard to the Indian Cotton Tariff proposalscomes up for consideration I think it desirable to indicatemy views on it briefly.     It appears to me in face of the considerations advanced by the Viceroy that we must reluctantly admit that thegrounds on which the decision to increase the Indian cottonduties generally is based are difficult to controvert.  Itis of course greatly to be regretted that the lancashire cotton Industry should be faced at this moment with adecision to increase duties in one of its principalmarkets, but the decision, regrettable as it is, appearsto be inevitable.     On the other hand, the proposal of the Viceroy thatthe special protective duty which is to be placed, in theinterests of the Bombay Mill owners, on plain grey  goodsshall only apply to imports from outside the British Empireis one which should in my opinion be warmly welcomed.   i venture to think that His majesty1s Government would do well to express their appreciation of the consideration which theGovernment of  India have given to their views andparticularly of their readiness to submit to the legislaturea proposal of  this almost unprecedented character.     In all the circumstances, I very much hope that every-thing possible will be done to assist the Viceroy Inputting forward this proposal by meeting the other suggestions he makes in his telegram.  I ought perhaps  to
      add that whilst from the point of view of principle the      proposal that the special surtax on plain grey goods shall      not apply to exports from this country is one of considerable,      if not of epoch making importance, the actual effect on      Lancashire interests of the proposal is one which I have no      wish to exaggerate.           In the year ended iaarch 31st, 1928, the latest Indian      financial year for which I have detailed statistics, the      total value of all imports of cotton piece goods into India      from the United Kingdom was about 427 million rupees.  Of      this amount only 19 million rupees represented goods of the      classes which under the Viceroy&apos;s proposal will now enjoy      a preference over our foreign competitors, of whom, of      course, Japan is the chief.  On the other hand, more than      half of the imports of piece goods from Japan consisted of      goods of this particular description (46f million rupees out      of 82^ million rupees), and there is thus always the      possibility that we may recapture some of our lost ground in      this particular line of goods, which may compensate to some      extent for such loss of trade as will, I fear, inevitably      result from the increased duties on bordered grey goods,      bleached goods and coloured goods, in which we are mainly      interested.                                          W.G.Board of Trade.  14th February, 1950.
