  O^SS^L^L^A^^^1 QF.IIIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S government&amp;fflMIilKT)SI.3^90(30)CABINET.       Committee on the Colonial Sugar Industry.                    Beport.1.        At their Meeting on the 19th February, 1930,(Cabinet 11  (30) Conclusion 5), the Cabinet had before themcertain Memoranda (Papers CP. 40 (30) (covering the Reportof the West Indian Sugar Commission) and CF. 52 (30)),circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies inregard to the position of the sugar industry in the VestIndies and Mauritius and agreed, inter alia:-     that a Cabinet Committee composed as follows -         The Chancellor of the Exchequer         The Secretary of State for the Colonies         The First Lord of the admiralty should examine the whole of the questions raise a in regardto the position of the sugar industry in the West Indies and mauritius, including the question of transport to the west indies, and should consider,  in the first instance whethersomething could be done to obtain temporary assistancethrough the Colonial Development Fund.2.        Since the appointment of the Committee theSecretary cf State for the Colonies has circulated to theCabinet the Report of Sir Francis Watts on the MauritiusSugar Industry (Paper CP,, 59 (30))  and the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries has circulated a Memorandum(Paper CP. 57 (30) ) on the  position of the British sugar beet Industry.   This document was before the Cabinet attheir Meeting on 26th February, (Cabinet 12 (30)  conclusion).
3.        The facts as to the &quot;&apos;est Indian sugar situationare summarised in the Secretary of State&apos;s memorandumG.   40 (30),   The present world-wide depression in sugaris due to over-production which is largely the result ofencouragement by bounties, subsidies and protectivetariffs.    &quot;rith the exception of -Java and Cuba, the british colonies can produce sugar as cheaply as any countriesin the world:  they cannot, however, produce it at thepresent world price of 8/- a cwt.   Even with the existing british preference, efficient &quot;Test Indian producers are suffering  losses up to 2/- a cwt.   In the opinion of thevrest Indian Sugar Commission the removal of the  Britishpreference would result in the virtual winding up of theindustry after the present crop has been cut, withdisastrous financial and economic consequences to theColonies concerned and particularly to the islands ofBarb^does,Antigua and St.  Kitts which are v/holly dependenton sugar;  and even if the British preference is maintained at its present rate, there will be, if the present situationcontinues,  curtailment of sugar planting, and consequentunemployment and a decline in the local public revenues.The situation  of the Mauritius industry is very similar in all these respects to that of the 1-fest Indian industry.No other industry can take its place in Mauritius and in Sir P.  &quot;7atts&apos;s opinion its maintenance appears to be essential to the continuance of the econmmic and sociallife of the&apos;Colony.          The British Colonial sugar industry:is tolerablyefficient on its factory side &quot;but is somewhat backward onits :lanting side.
4.       The West Indies Sugar Commission recommended        1. that international action should he taken to           eliminate high tariffs and subsidies;        2. that an Import Board should be set up to buy           Imperial sugar at  15 a ton c.i.f. and other           sugar at the market price (now under  8)        3. that the British preference should be increased           from 3/8d.  to 4/8d. per cwt.  and maintained at           that figure pending the conclusion of an           agreement under (1) or the adoption of (2).5.       Sir Francis Watts recommended for Mauritiussubsidies to cover the excess of the oost of production,taken at 13/- per cwt, over the price realised in theColony.6.       As regards the -Vest Indies commission srecommendations -        (1) There is no immediate prospect of the action            suggested.        (2) Tho Committee have requested Sir Warren Fisher            to expedite the consideration of this proposal            by his Departmental Committee which is          v  examining  the general question of Import Boards.        (3) Apart from other considerations,any proposal  to            increase the existing  British preference            is open to the objection that such increase            could not  in practice be restricted to the            comparatively small amount of sugar imported            from the West Indies and Mauritius,  but would            have to be given also to Australia and South            Africa,  The question of an  increased preferenoe            should,  therefore,  be ruled  out  from  consideration.
 7.        India is the natural market for Mauritius sugar, and large numbers of Indians are employed in the Island  and would   hare to be repatriated to India if the sugar industry  is closed down.   The Government of India have recently  (in reply to a request made by the late Gowernment in April, 1929) given their reasons for adhering to their decision  that a change in the Indian Customs tariff in favour of sugar imports from Mauritius could not be justi&quot; ied. The Secretary of State for the Colonies has undertaken to make further representations to the Secretary of State for India on the subject, particularly with reference to a suggestion that it would be of material assistance to Mauritius if India could exempt Mauritius sugar from the increase of duty proposed in the new Indian hudget, even though she could not see her way to giving the Colony more preferential treatment. . 8.      Measures for the reorganisation and permanent improvement of the Colonial sugar industry, such as planting improved varities of cane, installing more modern machinery, amalgamating estates, developing the system of cane growing by peasant  farmers,  improving methods of cultivation and of transport etc.  would fall within the scope of the Colonial Development Fund,  and the Secretary of State for the Colonieswill arrange that  schemes will &quot;be prepared and submitted to the Colonial Development Advisory Committee as  quickly as possible. 9.      These,  however are long range measures,  and,  in accordance with the wishes of the Cabinet,  the Committeehave examined the  feasibility of obtaining temporary assistancfrom the Colonial  Development Fund to enable the industry tobe kept alive Meantime. 10.      The Committee are of opinion that if production is to continue  it  will be necessary to support the credit of the growers to  enable them to obtain ediort term  cropadvances to be  repaid when the sugar is exported or sold.

The Committee are of opinion that if production is to continue it  will be necessary to support the credit of the growers to  enable them to obtain ahort term  cropadvances to be repaid when the sugar is exported or sold.
Prom the point of view of possible reactions on british agriculture and other depressed British industries, it is imperative that the fullest use should be made of existingColonial machinery and resources and that the BritishGovernment should be kept as much as possible in thebaakground.11.      The Committee are of opinion that the colonial development Fund could not properly be used to affordtemporary financial assistance in order to keep an industryalive.   In any event there is no fund already in existence and whatever money the fund will need will have to beprovided &apos;-, from Totes.12.       The Committee have examined a scheme proposed bythe Secretary of State for tho Colonies whereby His majesty&apos;s government would advance to the Colonies sums sufficient toenable them to advance iaZ per acre to the growers as a shortterm crop advance recoverable on export.   At the requestof tie Committee,  the Secretary of State for the Colonies,in consultation with xhe Treasury, has conferred withrepresentatives of Barclay&apos;s Bank.13.       The representatives of Barclays Bank explainedthat recently they have been obliged to advance to west indian growers practically the whole cost of productionof sugar.   An advance of  2 per acre would not be sufficientand the prior lien of the Government in respect of thatadvance would prevent the Bank from making further advanceson an adequate scale.   The Bank would be willing to continueto make advances on an adequate scale if the Government would bear losses up to ZOjo of the sums advanced.    Their offer was for the West Indies only as they were not sufficientlyconversant with the working of the trade in Mauritius.    TheSecretary of State for the Colonies,  however,  induced theBank to revise their offer and agree  to share losses withthe Colonial Governments equally,  subject,  however,  to  thecondition that the Colonial Government&apos;s losses would be
                                                           3 ?3                                                           t* &amp; tilimited to half of 30$ of the sums advanced.   In the Bank&apos;6view  300,000 would cover the whole conceivable loss to theColonies in the West Indies.   But it is hoped that the total loss to the West Indian Governments will not amount to anything like that figure.14.        The accompanying draft telegram to the West Indieshas been prepared by the Colonial Office in consultation withthe Treasury to embody this arrangement.15,        Briefly the proposal is that the Colonial Governmentsshall guarantee to the Banks or other approved lenders halftheir losses subject to a limit of fifteen per cent, of theamount of each advance not recoverable at the expiration of twelve months from the end of the crop season.   If this is done it is proposed that His Majesty1s Government shallundertake to ask Parliament in due course to vote as a grant in aid half thedassesfentually incurred by the Colonies underthe scheme within a total maximum limit of  300,000 for theWest Indies.16.        If the draft telegram is approved by the Cabinet,the next step will be to communicate it confidentially to representatives of all the banks operating in the West indies and in Mauritius as the offer which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare prepared to make and to invite their co-operation.17.        The corresponding telegram to Mauritius will be modified in the sense that His Majesty1s Government are making this offer to the West Indies and are prepared to do the samefor Mauritius, subject to any modifications of detail rendered necessary by local conditions, and subject to an overridingtotal liability of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Colony ofone half of  200,000, which is a round figure bearing roughlythe same proportion to  300,000 as the average sugar exportof Mauritius bears to the average f/est Indian exports.
18,   The Committee recommend the Cabinet to adopt thescheme negotiated by the Secretary of State as set out  in  thedraft telegram appended hereto, and to authorise him tocommunicate the approved arrangements to the colonial governments concerned,,                      Signed on behalf -of  -       *                          the Committee.

His Majesty&apos;e Government suggest                 that the Colonial Government should guarantee                 the bank or other approved lender in respect of                 one half of the losses of capital and interest                 on crop advances not recovered within twelve                 months from the end of the crop season,,provided                 that the liability of the Government in any one                 case shall not exceed fifteen per cent of the                 total advance made in that case.    The advances                 must be made a first charge on the cane and/or                 sugar produced and any further legislation                 necessary for the purpose must be introduced,                 and should provide for an obligation to cultivate                 after receipt of the money.                           If the Colonial Government will make                 these arrangements His Majesty&apos;s  Government will                 be prepared to ask Parliament in  due course to                 provide half of any loss that may be incurred                 by the Colony   under the guarantee, the other                              7.
