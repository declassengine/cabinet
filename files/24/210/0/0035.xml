-J^G ret..P.^85j.30).COPY NOW-AGRICULTURE AND EMPLOYMENT.Memorandum &quot;by the Lord Privy Seal.I have read the memorandum of the Minister ofAgriculture (C.P. 76 (30)) and Sir Daniel Hall&apos;s memorandum to the Economic Advisory. Council (E.A.C.(H) 77) and wishto make some ohservations on the relation between thepresent difficulties of agriculture and our generalemployment policy.2.        We are, and must be, primarily an industrialcountry, dependent upon other countries for a great partof our food supplies, and finding in those countriesmarkets for the export of our industrial products.    Curagricultural policy must be based upon an acceptance ofthat fact.    Y/e cannot, for example, regard imports ofwheat from the Argentine .as a calamity, remembering how much of our coal and&apos;other commodities the Argentine isenabled to buy owing to her agricultural exports.    nor can we assume that our own interests would be better servedif we substituted more Canadian wheat for Argentine wheat,even if Canadian purchases of our basic products increased.3.        At the same time, reasonable stability in ouragriculture is essential to a healthy industrial position.In spite of all its troubles, agriculture still givesdirectly and indirectly, the largest field of employmentof any industry.   There is little doubt that we have to face an inevitable contraction of some other basic
 industries, and.&quot; w-ill have to struggle to maintain the level of our exports.   Fe cannot, therefore, afford to see an accelerated decline of employment or general production in agriculture.   Further, agriculture is a widely-spread, industry;  we already have serious difficulties in many of our &quot;big towns where industries and population are concentrated, and it is of the highest importance that the general economic position of the smaller towns and villages should not he allowed to he come so had. that they also slip down into financial straits.    It is to a wide distribution of industrial activity, helped by,the transport and power facilities that our Railway, Road and HHectrical policies are fostering,  that we must look for some compensation for the changed position of some of the basic trades.          ....s a matter of industrial policy, therefore, I would strongly support practical proposals for strengthen- ing the position of agriculture. 4.        .1s I understand it, the immediate problem is connected with cereals and potatoes;   the mill: and egg situation is- relatively sound and can be expected to improve;   meat may improve under the National Harks Scheme and the probable diversion to the United States ofAmerica of some of the Argentine supplies;  and bacon requires a  policy related to methods of production and requiring time before anything effective can be done. This difference of prospect is important;  although cereals and potatoes give more employment per acre than most other  forms of farming, it does not follow that our agricultural prosperity should be judged solely or mainly by the position of wheat.    It may be that in the future
 the line of evolution for our agriculture will he away from  cereals, except to the extent that they are required for feeding purposes or to help the land, and in the direction of more intensive cultivation of products easily marketable in adjacent towns.    The prosperous Scandinavian farming is not based upon cereals.    Further, much of the present difficulty of the crops other than wheat is probably temporary;  its consequences are felt because it comes after some difficult, but not ruinous, seasons.          For all products,  under the Statutory harketing Bill proposed in CP. 25( 30) and approved by the Cabinet, a policy, on what appear to me sound lines, is in preparation, but it will take time to bring it into operation, and. it is claimed that it will not help the present situation.We are, therefore, invited to  deal, on emergency lines,with an emergency, trying, if  possible, to-make our expedients consistent with the major policy and free from commitments which would embarrass that policy.    I hope I am correctly analysing the position, because important deductions follow from this view of it. 5.      .  What is that emergency?   Is it the same emergency for each of the cereals and. for potatoes, and. how far isa uniform remedy necessary or  desirable?   As I  read theposition,  wheat is one problem, oats and barley another,and potatoes a third.          The trouble in wheat is that after a steady decline over the last two or three years world, prices fell rapidly during the end of 1929 and the beginning of 1930,and now stand, below the average cost of production ofhome-grown wheat.    (This fall in raw material prices is                         -3-
not  confined to  agricultural products;  it is world-wideand  is responsible for much of the present anxiety in industry).          It must be remembered that we ere only producin,about 20 per cent, of our annual requirements of wheat.(I attach figures showing our home-production and importsof the chief cereals, and of hops and potatoes, over theyears 1926-8, which help to clarify the problem).   --ricefor home-grown wheat must, therefore, move in sympathy with world- prices.   Ho subsidy that is not financiallyfantastic could alter this;  and previous experience hasshown that any guarantee by the State of ;:fair prices&quot;,which the farmers translate as something on top of costof production,  only reducers  our dependence upon foreignsupplies very little.   For several years agriculturehas had a series of State &quot;dole?:&apos;1 of one form or another,from subsid.ies  to derating, but neither the industry northe State can show much benefit as the result.    these general doles have another bad effect, in that  the;/descend upon the good, and the bad- farmer without discrimination.    A whole system of controlled farmingwould, in any case be necessary if a subsidy is  not to beabused., and, I do not see the farmers accepting  this.          I am,  therefore, against any direct subsidy bythe State, either on an acreage basis, or by a  guarantee to purchase all wheat offered at what the agriculturistscall a ;:fair price:; (according to the AgriculturalConference now  sitting 55s. is a fair price;   this isabout 12/14-s.  above current import prices).
$ *  Import Boards .          whether or not on a long view there is anyjustification for a /-heat Import Board, with a statutorymonopoly of wheat purchases, (a question that is being examined by a Departmental Committee), it would be useless In the present predicament of the farmers unlessthe Board sere compelled to purchase all home-grown wheatoffered, at a price substantially higher than would berealised by the wheat in a free market.  I have seen itstated that the economies open to such a Board would,by averaging over the whole of our annual requirementsof wheat, produce for home-grown wheat 10s. a quarterabove world-prices without any Increase in the priceof flour.  This is apparently dependent also uponstatutory control of the flour-milling industry.  ButI have never seen any balance sheet of economies tosupport that statement, which is difficult to reconcilewith the competitive position created by the presentlarge offerings of low-priced wheat and low freights.          Further, in the event of a short worldsupply of wheat, the position of a monopoly purchasingBoard which admittedly has to purchase.se from abroadnot less than 80 per cent, of its requirements,would be financially unenviable as It would heexposed to concentrated attack from the producing countries.          There would in any case be serious politicaldlfflculties in front of. such a scheme which seem v,, meto make  Its Immediate adoption impossible, and th--.rOare important  Imperiai and  international complicationswhich must be  thought out to the end before we commit ourselves to such a policy  In relation to wheat.
7*   Statutory proportion of home-grown wheat in flour.          I think that urgent and serious consideration should begiven to a statutory requirement  that all flour milled in thiscountry must contain not less than say, 15 per cent, of home-grown wheat.  This should be experimental for two years, withthe declared intention of slowly raising the proportion if the experiment proved in the public interest.  (I understand thatsuch a stipulation operates in some Continental Countrieswithout difficulty).          This would give the farmers a guaranteed market for asubstantial proportion of their average production; indeed itwould probably encourage the cultivation of an Incree-sed acreageover the present figures, and it would tend to benefit the most efficient producers.          The fanners would have a strong bargaining; factor fora better price within that market, with the check upon them thatthe sale of anything above the 15 per cent  would depend uponthe average price they tried to secure for the whole, and throughthe importation of foreign flour if the farmers and the millersexploited the position.8.         To make the arrangement effective, some organisedmarketin- of home-grown wheat would be wanted.  If the Bill could go through in time, well and. rood, but even if not, the farmers would have some foundation on which, if ever at all, they might beexpected to organise themselves to the limited extent necessary.In paragraph 11 I make a suggestion with regard to some financial help towards this.  I suggest also that if the emergency is asgrave as the Minister of Agriculture fears, the Bill should beIntroduced and passed as quickly as possible.                           -6-
g.        In oats  and  barley,  there  is  no  similar dependence uponforeign supplies.   During recent months, as  I understand it, anamount of  fdreign  oats,  not  much more  than the normal importa-tion,  has  been dumped  on our market  at  very loft subsidisedprices.  In a home-market nervous  and  disorganised by a largehome oat crop, this has  had  a  result disproportionate to the size of the imports.  If this- is  so, and the trouble Is due toweak selling, organised  marketing  is probably the practical solution,  along the lines of the  proposed  Bill.  Small psreelsof dumped  goods do not shake an organised  trade.  In the caseof barley the disorganisation  does not  appear to have becomeso serious.10.       The same appears to  be true  of potatoes, except thatthe crop was abnormally  large, and that some panic appears tohave been created  by the arrival  of  rather large consignments of early foreign potatoes,  Here  again organised marketingseems  to be the solution.          I want to cail the attention of  my colleagues toC.P.58 (30) and in particular  to  paragraph 7.  This seems to mean account of the  trouble free from  exaggeration, with a recognition of the stability that  would be given by organisedmarketing u          I am bound to  say that  I do  not  see why import boardsare necessary for  oats,  barley and potatoes, or how they would help to meet the difficulty of cheap imported produce, unless,in addition to monopoly rights of  purchase, they also had theright to prohibit  imports, either generally or from particular countries.  Is this seriously contemplated, and if so, how dowe reconcile it with our general  trade policy ?11.       All these Indications point  the  same way,towards thenecessity for organised  internal  marketing.  Much of the presenttrouble,except in  wheat, is probably temporary and we ought not tobe put off our main xjolicy by the  clamour  of the National Farmers1Union or of the political press,or the studiously vague promises
of other parties.   I think it should he made clear to the     Ofarmers that this is our view and our policy, that they willbe expected to make an &quot;effort to help themselves as otherindustries are being forced to do,  with the support that ourBill will give them.          Unless they     willing to make this effort I donot see how  we can help them, or why we should.   But if theyare willing, thero are certain financial responsibilities 1 thatwill have ,to bo undertaken at once to start the organisation.Under the Bill It is apparently contemplated that this money should be provided by way of loan,  free cf interest in part.I feel that in the present mood cf the farmers they will hangback if they are asked collectively to undertake any financialliability, however contingent.   I suggest therefore that weshould consider the possibility of offering them, even iiiadvance of the Bill, a grant of all the money required for thepreliminary expenses connected with the organisation, for aperiod of two years.   This grant should not cover finance forthe &apos;holding&apos; of produce.   l1o do that effectively very large sums would be required and, at a time when the trend ofagricultural prices is uncertain, we should be exposingourselven to serious losses.   If the organisations developproperly  I see no reason why a system of advances  (or insurance against falls in price) could not be made to operate in thiscountry on the analogy of the Canadian wheat pool, though ofcourse not on identical lines.   But such a scheme, unless it is to be wrecked at once by grave errors of estimating, needs to be worked out carefully and to come gradually; nothing of thekind that wo^ild be both effective and safe could be done forthe 1930  crops.          I should prefer to see money spent in a constructiveeffort of this kind rather than  in a subsidy to an&quot;unemployment insurance&quot; acheme which would be criticised asa confession of failure to help the industry constructively.
12D      Summing up,  I suggest that we should:    (l)  reaffirm our view of the necessity of organised        marketing as the basis of any constructive policy,  and        announce our intention of putting statutory support        behind the efforts of the industry to organise itself,        and of supplying the initial expenses of the     &apos;        organis at icn;    (2)  require by Statute the milling of a fixed percentage        (say 157o) of home-grown wheat in all flour milled        either for home consumption or export;    (3)  declare ourselves against a direct subsidy to wheat        or against a wheat Import Board merely as a cloak for        purchasing home-grown wheat by the State above the        level of import prices.
