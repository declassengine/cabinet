I  H..B T                    MJRAL; AMBMITIES BILL .             Memorandum by  the  First Commissioner of Yiforks 0                    The special  interest of my department in  this  Bill          is  confined to the provisions relating  to  the  export  of          buildings and to  the  protection  of  bridges0                    The Commissioners  of Works already have some power          to  prevent the demolition and export of ancient buildings  by          the issue of a Preservation  Order under the Ancient Monuments          Act,,   The possibility of taking such  action depends  in  great          measure on the facts  being known in time;   and the  difficulty          is  that the owner is  under no obligation to give  notice  of          impending demolition  and  removal unless the building  has been          previously scheduled  under the act   Buildings  cannot be          scheduled so long as  they- are occupied as  dwelling  houses0          The advantage of  the  clause  in  the  Bill is that  the owner  of          any building proposing to export it in whole or  in  part  is?          whether it is scheduled or not,  put under an obligation  to          give notice to the Commissioners and obtain their consent  to          his proposalG                    As regards  bridges,  the  consent of the Commissioners          to alteration or removal  is  required in the case of those          which have been scheduled under the Ancient Monuments act          It is often a question of some  difficulty to decide whether          a particular bridge can be classified as an ancient monument          in the terms of the Act,  and there are bridges which could                                                              hardly
hardly be ao classified but yet which are of pleasing design and . which f i t so appropriately into the scenery that their removal or alteration would be a loss to the countryside,  Itwould be all to the good if some means such as are proposedby the Bill., were provided for giving weighty considerationto proposals for the removal or alteration of all old bridges 6&apos; *                                                              .., j          The Bill on these points usefully supplements theexisting powers of my department and, without going Intodetails, I can in general terms give It my support018th , 6hr^-ry-^19g0?-
