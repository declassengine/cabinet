REPORT.Introduction.    1.   WE have  considered  the Draft Treaty on Financial Assistance.    2.   A number of the Articles of this Treaty deal entirely with problems of a strictly  financial nature; we have  confined ourselves  to an examination of thosearticles which involved questions of a political character, as we understand that thefinancial side is being considered by the League&apos;s Financial Committee.The Draft Treaty.    3.   Four main points were  put before us as being still outstanding, and it  is with these that we  have been mainly concerned.    4.   I. Conditions for  Financial Assistance.    A rticle I: -        &quot; The financial assistance provided for by  the present Convention shall be    given in any case of war or threat  of war in which the Council of the League    of  Nations, seized  in virtue of  the Covenant, decides that, as a  measure to    restore or safeguard the peace of nations  in accordance with the objects  of the    Covenant, such assistance  shall be accorded  to  a High Contracting  Party    involved in the war or threat of war.&quot;    5.   The draft given above was drawn up by the  Financial  Committee  of theLeague  and has been subject to  much discussion, especially in regard to finding a substitute for  the words &quot; threat of war.&quot;  This phrase was considered to  be toovague.   The Foreign Office suggest redrafting  this article into two paragraphs, oneof which should deal with the actual case of war, and  the other with the  threat of war.  As redrafted, paragraph 1 would  read as follows  :                              (a.) In Case of War. &apos;    &quot; (a). If a State,  in violation  of its international obligations,  resorts to war against  a High Contracting Party,  the Council, seized in virtue of the Covenant,and at the request of that party,  should decide  that the financial assistance providedfor in the present Covenant  shall be accorded  to the said Contracting  Party.&quot;    6.   The-only  question  in dispute in this paragraph  centred on the word&quot;should.&quot;   We were informed  that the Germans  desired to substitute the word&quot;may,&quot; and the French to strengthen the meaning by altering the  words &quot;theCouncil  should &quot; to the words &quot; it shall be the duty of the Council to.&quot;    7.   We recommend that the word &quot; may &quot; should be used in preference  to theword &quot; should,&quot; though if this latter wording is strongly pressed, we  suggest thatit be accepted.  The word &quot; may &quot; gives rather more discretion to the Council.    8.   It is probable that certain States,  including, as we were informed, India,might be more ready to sign  the Convention if  the word &quot; may &quot; were used, thougheven so it seems unlikely that India would  sign on financial grounds.                             (b.)  Threat  of  War.    9.   We have had three drafts of this second paragraph put before us, preparedby the Foreign Office, by France, and by Germany and  Italy.  The British ForeignOffice proposal is as follows:         &quot;(p.)  If the Council, in pursuit of its duty under the Covenant, shall, in    any international dispute likely to lead to war,  have taken action to safeguard    peace,  then, if either of the parties to the dispute  shall refuse or neglect to    comply with any directions given by the Council in furtherance of  such action,    the  Council shall accord financial assistance to the other party.&quot;      [20509]                                                        B 2
    10.  The alternative proposed by France is as follows :          &quot; (&amp;.) Further, if two or more States have undertaken, under conditions to    be defined by a convention on the means of preventing war, or undertaken before    the Council to carry out the measures recommended by the Council in order to    prevent or arrest hostilities between them, the Council may  declare that it will    accord financial assistance to those of the States in question, being parties to    the  present convention,  to whose  detriment the said  measures  have been    infringed.&quot;    This French draft in effect requires that the two parties to the dispute shouldbe asked to vote on the question of either of them receiving financial assistance.Such a proposal would be abortive in practice.    11.  The German and Italian  Draft was as follows:-          &quot;(6.) If in a crisis the Council  considers that there is a danger of war,    it may notify the two parties to the dispute that  financial assistance will be    granted to the State against which one of the parties to the dispute goes to war.    The Council may add this notice to the recommendations that it may make in    virtue of Article 11 of the Covenant.&quot;    This  draft  does not provide for the granting of  financial assistance beforeaggression, but only for a promise that it will be granted should  aggression takeplace.  Such procedure might fail to give assistance effectively when it was required as a preventive measure.    12.  We  therefore prefer the British  Draft  as being more likely to operate inprevention of  war.  But we recommend some small verbal changes so that it would run as follows :-         &quot; (&amp;.) If the Council&apos;, in pursuit  of its duty under the  Covenant, shall, in    any international  dispute likely to lead to war, have decided  to take  action to    safeguard peace,  then, if either  of the parties to  the dispute  shall refuse or    neglect to comply with directions given by the Council in furtherance of such    decision,  the Council may accord financial assistance to the other party.         Before granting  financial  assistance,  the Council  shall  try  to use  all    appropriate measures to stop the conflict by mediation or other means.&quot;    13.  The representative of the Treasury has informed us that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer may wish  to criticise this scheme in principle when it is consideredby the Cabinet in view of its financial implications.  The Treasury representativealso raised the question of  the steps proposed  to  liquidate any  loan should noaggression take place.    We felt, however, that this was rather a matter for the Financial Committee.                          (c.) Peace-keeping Measures.    14.  We  recommend the adoption of this paragraph as amended by the ForeignOffice.  It  reads as follows :          &quot;The financial  assistance referred to  in paragraphs  (a) - and (b) of the    present Article shall only be granted  by the Council if the State involved :          &quot; (I.) Accepts and applies the provisional recommendations which may be                  made by the Council with  a view to preventing the aggravation of                  the situation or to the re-establishment of peace; and         &quot; (II.) Accepts  the  Council&apos;s   mediation or  the  arbitral  or  judicial                  settlement of the dispute.&quot;                            (d.) Refusal of Support.     15.   The French,  supported  by certain  other countries, have suggested theaddition of the following Article :          &quot; Without prejudice to the obligations arising from Article 16 of the     Covenant, the High Contracting Parties undertake to give no help,  direct or     indirect, to any Powers that  may be  involved in hostilities against a High     Contracting Party to which the financial assistance provided for in the present     Convention has been accorded.&quot;
    16.   We consider that the addition of this Article is superfluous, but harmlesssubject to one point.    17.   It appears to us that the Article is intended to apply only to one crisis, andas drafted now it might mean that no High Contracting Party in (say) 1940 would help the  enemies of a State to which a loan had been granted in (say) 1935;  theState having been a victim on the earlier occasion, but possibly open to blame on the later one.  We sought  legal  advice on this point  from  the  Foreign Office, whoinformed  us  that, in their opinion, the existing wording of the French proposal was open to  the criticism suggested, and that, although it would seem unlikely thatthe article would be so interpreted in practice,  it might be well to put the questionbeyond any  possibility of doubt.  Accordingly we recommend the addition of thefollowing words at the end of the article :  &quot;in connection with the said hostilitiesor with the dispute out of which they arose.&quot;    Should  the Convention be  ultimately limited to  cases  where hostilities have actually broken out, then it would of course be necessary to omit the words &quot; or withthe dispute out  of which they arose.&quot;    18.   II. Connection with  Disarmament.         &quot; The  present   Convention shall not come  into  force  until  a  general    Disarmament Convention, in accordance with Article 8 of the League Covenant,    has been brought into operation.  The present Covenant shall cease to have effect    as soon  as  the general Convention  ceases to be operative.&quot;         &quot;It is also to be a condition that no country  which is not a party to such    Disarmament Convention, or which shall  fail to  carry out its  obligations of    such  a   Convention,  shall  be  entitled to  the  benefits  under the  present    Convention.&apos;&apos;    19.   We understand that it is proposed to  add the above article with a view tolinking it up definitely with the Disarmament Treaty,  and that it has already beenadopted by the  Third Committee of the Tenth Assembly.    20.   We recommend that this Article be accepted.    21.   III. The Council&apos;s Vote.    We   have  had  under  consideration  the  question  whether  it  would  be proper for the Council to give a majority vote or whether unanimity  should beachieved.  We think that on Article I the decision should be unanimous ; on all other questions  we are advised that the decisions should be by majority.   In neither case should the votes  of the parties  to the dispute be counted.  We therefore  propose the adoption of the text for Article 26 recommended by the Third Committee of theAssembly, namely :    &quot; (1)  Decisions of the Council under Article I shall require the agreement of all          the  Members represented at  the meeting, other than the representatives          of the parties to the dispute;    (2) All other decisions taken by the Council in virtue  of the present Convention          shall be taken by  a simple majority of the Members represented at the          meeting, other than the representatives of the  parties  to the dispute.&quot;    22.   We are informed that the Third  Committee inclined to  the  view thatdisputes  as to application should be decided by the Council, and that disputes oninterpretation should be,dealt with by a  &quot;non-suspensive right of appeal to thePermanent Court.&quot;    The  Financial Committee of the League, however,  have expressed the view thatit is desirable, for the efficacy of the Convention, that the necessary decisions requiredby it should involve no delay and should be final in  character.  From this point ofview the  Financial Committee  recommended  that the present text  should not be altered, so that all disputes would be settled by  the Council.    23.   We agree with the view of the Financial  Committee and  recommend noalterations in Articles 21 and 25.
    We attach, as Appendix I, a copy of the articles which we have suggested shouldbe amended or added, and, as Appendix II, a copy of the Convention.-(Signed)   ARTHUR HENDERSON (Chairman).

                      REPORT OF THE  FINANCIAL COMMITTEE.     On September 18th, 1928, the following resolution was adopted by the Assembly:         &quot; The  Assembly:         &quot; (1)   Expresses its satisfaction  with the work of the Committee on Arbitration and     Security and the Financial Committee in connection with the scheme for financial assistance;         &quot; (2)   Requests the Council to invite the Financial Committee to continue the prepara-     tion of this scheme in the form of a draft Convention, bearing in mind the directions given     in the report (document A.60.1928.IX)  submitted to the  Assembly at  its  ninth  ordinary     session on behalf of its  Third Committee;         &quot; (3)   Expresses the hope that a full draft Convention complete in all its details may     be submitted to the Assembly at its  tenth ordinary session;         &quot; (4)   Invites the Secretary-General to  submit the draft Convention as  soon as it is     prepared to the Governments in order that they may give instructions to  their delegates at     the tenth ordinary session of the Assembly.&quot;     This resolution was transmitted to the Financial Committee by a decision of the Council ofSeptember 21st, 1928.  In accordance with this resolution, the Financial Committee has prepared a draft Convention, which together with an &quot; expose des motifs &quot; it has the  honour to submit to the Council herewith.     The idea underlying the plan for  financial assistance is a simple one, namely, that collectiveassistance should be  given promptly and  effectively to reinforce the powers of  resistance of aState threatened, in the view of the League, by aggression.   The translation of this idea into a legalinstrument  necessarily has resulted in  a  long and somewhat  complex  document.   It may be convenient to preface the draft Convention by some account of the origin of the scheme.     The Finnish Government, which was  the first in 1926 to advocate the desirability  of givingprompt help to a State menaced by  aggression,  urged the practical consideration  that certainStates would not enjoy a sense of sufficient security and would therefore not be  able to limit theirarmaments or indeed to refrain from creating war industries unless  they could rely on help of thiskind.  The memorandum containing the general proposals of the Finnish Government was referred by the Council to the  Financial Committee in December 1926, and since then the Committee hasaddressed itself to the task of translating it into a practical scheme which, backed by the collective responsibility of the States Members of the League, would ensure prompt and effective assistancewhenever the Council  decided that circumstances had arisen in which help should be given.     The Financial  Committee  has, of course, been aware that the preparation of such a schemeinvolved not only  technical, but also political,  considerations.   As it  stated in its report ofSeptember 1928, &quot;  the Committee realises, of course, that the political and constitutional aspectsof the above questions will need consideration by the. appropriate authorities and that financial considerations cannot  alone be taken into account.  It should be pointed out, however, that it isequally true that the questions referred to have a direct influence upon the financial practicabilityand  usefulness  of  the   scheme,  and their financial  aspects  will  therefore equally require consideration.&quot; 1     Accordingly, in the course of preparing the present Convention, the preliminary outline of theplan was submitted by the Council to a special Committee on Arbitration and Security set up inNovember  1927 which submitted a report to the  Assembly at its ninth ordinary session (1928)..The  suggestions which were  made on that occasion, as well as by the Assembly at its eighth2and  ninth ordinary sessions, have guided the Financial Committee in its  subsequent work.     The origin of the scheme indicates that its declared object was .to reinforce the general sense of security in order to promote the progress of disarmament.  In order to attain this object, it was essential that the scheme should satisfy the test of practical application.  More than this, in so faras it was intended to  act as  a deterrent, it was important that States which would be expectedto regard the scheme as a factor influencing their disarmament  policies should realise in advance that its application could and would be swift, automatic and efficacious.     It is with these preoccupations in mind that the Committee addressed itself to the task of framing a  Convention.  But the Committee was  obliged to take  into account  another set of considerations.   In practice,  the scheme, if it is to be of value, must ensure that a State menacedby aggression shall have the certainty of  obtaining rapidly a large sum  of money through thefinancial markets in circumstances where its credit is likely in the  eyes of the market to  be impaired.   This is a peculiar and difficult problem and any attempt to solve it  comes up against certain ineluctable  facts  concerning the willingness of markets to lend  in such circumstances and the necessity of having automatic guarantees.   It is the deliberate opinion of the FinancialCommittee that, if a workable scheme is to be set up which will satisfy the essential conditionof commanding  the confidence of participating States,  it must be surrounded by  a degree of automatic security as great as that which they contemplate in the present scheme.    1  Document A.45.1928.II   Report of Financial Committee on its Thirty-second Session.    -  The Assembly, at its eighth ordinary session, expressed its conviction &quot; of the need for a system of financial aid for contributing to&apos;the organisation of security, which is an indispensable preliminary to general disarmament&quot;.
                                 EXPOSE&quot;  DES MOTIFS.    i.   The object of the Convention is to provide machinery by which the Council of the Leagueof Nations, seized in virtue of the Covenant and as a measure to restore or safeguard the peace of nations, may authorise financial assistance to Members of the League involved in war or threat of war.  The aim of the scheme is to aid a Member in favour of whom the League has decided toenforce the Convention to reinforce its credit by the guarantee of all other Members.    The  Convention contemplates  that a loan would be  obtained in the  ordinary way in themoney market and that the Government concerned  should itself contract  such loan on the general security of its revenues.  It would be helped in so doing by the moral and material support of aninternational guarantee provided, under the aegis of the League, by the other signatories to theConvention.  This guarantee would cover the full  service of the  loan.    It would be essential, in order to create  confidence, that delay would not occur at the moment of crisis, that the Convention should be ratified forthwith by the signatory  Governments in sucha form that no further legislation of any kind would  be required in  connection with giving theguarantee.    Since, on  the outbreak of hostilities, the credit of a belligerent  country in foreign marketsis likely to be low, lenders would require guarantees  of a very substantial nature before they wouldsubscribe. Moreover, a multiplicity of guarantors involves difficulties and delays in circumstances where promptness of action is of the very essence of the Convention.  It is therefore proposed tofortify and simplify the scheme  by creating special guarantees  by  which  a  few financiallystrong signatories would guarantee, vis-d-vis  the investors, the whole service of the loan, whichwould, in this way,  become thrice secured:         (i)  By the borrowing  Government  itself;         (2)  By all the  signatories to the Convention (ordinary guarantee);         (3)  By  certain financially strong signatories (special guarantee).    2.  The advantages to the guaranteed Government would be:         (a)  The moral  support of the League  of Nations and the consequent classification of    the loan as a loan issued under the auspices  of the League  of Nations;         (b)  The market value of the guarantee at a moment when, ex hyfiothesi, the borrowers    credit  was weak;         (c)  The further market advantage  of the special guarantee;         (d)  The signatories&apos; promise of access to their markets;         (e)  The machinery (through the League Trustees, etc.) for the assured service of the loan.    The guarantors would only become liable in the contingency that the borrowing Government .itself was unable to meet its loan charges. In order to limit this contingent liability, the guarantorsare protected by:         (a)  A maximum  limit  on the  total annual service guaranteed;         (b)  A limit on  the maximum annual liability of any individual guarantor;         (c)  The primary responsibility of  the borrowing Government;         (d)  Provision  for a reserve;         (e)  The requirement of a unanimous decision of  the Council before a guarantee is given     in any individual case.     3.   Ordinary Guarantees.   The maximum annual liability of an ordinary guarantor Govern- ment, in respect of all loans contracted under the Convention, is limited to a figure bearing the same proportion to 100 million gold francs (this figure is purely illustrative) 1 as that Governments contribution to the League budget bears to  the total contributions from all Members of the League. Thus, if all the Members of the League become signatories to the  Convention, a maximum annual sum of 100 million gold francs can be guaranteed and a  Member contributing 5 per cent of the League expenses will have a maximum contingent annual liability of 5 million gold francs.   If, on the other hand, only some of the Members of the League sign the Convention, the  maximum annual sum that can be guaranteed will be proportionately reduced. For example, if the signatories pay together three-fifths of the League budget, the  maximum annual sum available  under the Convention will be three-fifths of  100, i.e., 60 million gold francs.     4.   Special Guarantees.   In addition to the above  ordinary guarantees, special guarantees are created to strengthen the security on which a loan is issued by ensuring that the loan service shall be guaranteed for its full amount, not merely by all the guaranteeing Governments as ordinary guarantors, but  also by a small  number of financially  strong  Governments which,  as  special guarantors, will bear the risk of any delay or default by the ordinary  guarantors.  The amount  covered by each special guarantee will include the  amount  of  the special guarantors liability    1  The Financial Committee has not fixed a definite figure, but it has not contemplated that the scheme would cover less than a substantial sum.
as an ordinary guarantor together with an additional amount which is determined in such a manner that the total of the additional amounts thus guaranteed by the special guarantor governments will equal the total amount guaranteed by the Governments which are ordinary guarantors only.In the event of default in the service of the loan, the full amount covered by a special guaranteeis payable by the special guarantors, but the  sum paid in excess of those  Governments&apos; liabilityas ordinary guarantors is reimbursable, after the  service has been met, out of the balance of callsto be made immediately upon the  guaranteeing Governments.    The maximum liabilities of special guarantor Governments are fixed by  dividing betweenthem the total of the maximum liabilities of the ordinary guarantors in proportion to the percen-tages which the special guarantors pay to the League budgets. If, for instance, as assumed above,the maximum contingent liabilities of the ordinary guarantors were a sum of 60 million gold francs,and if there were four special guarantors, who  pay 6, 6,  8 and 10 per cent respectively of theLeague&apos;s budget (total 30 per cent), the maximum contingent liabilities of these special guarantors(including their liabilities as ordinary guarantors) would be 6/30ths, 6/3oths, 8/30ths and io/3othsof 60 millions, i.e., 12, 12, 16 and  20 million gold francs respectively.    5. Application  to  a particular case.   When, in any particular instance, the Council hasdecided that a certain signatory shall receive  financial assistance, it will authorise such signatory to issue a loan (within the total available under the Convention) enjoying the ordinary and specialguarantees.   The maximum annual  service of this loan will be fixed by the Council.   The preciseresponsibility of each  ordinary guarantor for  each year will then  be determined by dividing theservice of the particular loan among ah the guaranteeing Governments in the proportion  of their maximum possible annual liabilities.   Similarly, the amount covered by each  special guaranteewill be determined by dividing the said service among the special guarantor Governments in theproportion of their  maximum possible annual liabilities.  The guarantors and special guarantorswill then deposit in safe keeping with the National Bank of Switzerland bonds bearing a separatecoupon for each payment for which they may be contingently liable, expressed in the currency inwhich the loan is payable.   Suppose that the  sum fixed by the Council as the annual service of aparticular authorised loan  amounts  to  15 millions, and that the maximum liabilities  of the fourspecial guarantors, considered above, are 12, 12, 16 and 20 millions respectively (total 60 millions),then the annual liability of these special  guarantors for the service of this specific loan wouldbe i2/6oths of 15; i2/6oths of 15; r6/6oths of 15, and 2o/6oths of 15, i.e., 3, 3, 4 and 5 millionsrespectively.    6.  The Convention further provides for  the appointment of Trustees (of Swiss  nationality)and the constitution by the borrowing Government of a reserve, to be held by the Trustees, of anamount sufficient to pay one-half of the annual service of each specific loan.    The operation of the guarantees in the event of default by a borrowing Government is indicatedin detail (Articles 16 to 20.)    7.  The decision by the Council to grant  assistance must be  taken by  the unanimous vote of its Members.  All other  decisions may be taken by single majority.    8.  The Council may accept an  offer by  a non-member of the  League to participate inguaranteeing the annual service of a particular loan.   Such participation may increase the totalof the loan, but must in no  way increase the liabilities of the Governments which are parties to theConvention.    9.  The Convention will be concluded for  a period of ten years, but  may be renewed  forfurther successive periods of five years.
                                     (Heads of States.)    Recognising the importance of creating a system of financial assistance to be given in the eventof war or threat of war with a view to restoring or safeguarding the peace of nations;    Considering that this object may best be achieved by means of an international convention;    Have appointed as their plenipotentiaries for this purpose:    Who, having communicated their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed as follows:                                        Article  i.    The  financial assistance provided for by the present Convention shall be given in any caseof war or threat of war in which the Council of the League of Nations, seized in virtue of theCovenant, decides that, as a measure to restore or safeguard the peace of nations in accordancewith the  objects of the Covenant, such assistance shall be accorded to a High Contracting Partyinvolved  in the war or threat of war.                                        Article  2.    The  financial assistance of the  High Contracting Parties shall  take the form of ordinaryguarantees and special guarantees covering, as below provided, the service of loans (which termshall include short-term credits) contracted in accordance with the present Convention.                                         Article 3.    For the ptirposes of the present Convention, the service of a loan  comprises the sums payable in each year for interest and amortisation, under the terms of the loan contracts.                                         Article 4.    No loan contracted under the present Convention shall be for a period exceeding thirty years.In order to facilitate, so soon as circumstances permit, the discharge of the ordinary guarantor and special guarantor  Governments from  their obligations in regard to  the  loan, a  Governmentcontracting a loan under this Convention shall, if possible, reserve the right to repay it before theend of its full period of maturity.Ordinary  Guarantees.                                        Article 5.    Each High Contracting Party hereby undertakes and recognises that the Governments of the territories for which he becomes a party to the present Convention severally guarantee as ordinaryguarantors, to the extent and in the manner set out  in the following articles, the due payment ofthe annual service of the loans which are contracted in accordance with the Convention.  Thesaid ordinary guarantees attach to each loan in virtue of the present Convention from the moment at which the loan is authorised, without any further action or consent on the part of the guarantorGovernment.                                        Article 6.    1.  Subject to the  provisions of Article 18 regarding payment of interest in the event ofdefault, the annual liability which can fall to the charge of any Government in the capacity of an ordinary guarantor, in respect of all the loans contracted in accordance with the present Convention,is limited  to a maximum.   This maximum shall  be a  sum  bearing  the same proportion to ........million gold francs as the contribution to the League&apos;s expenses payable by theGovernment, under the scale of allocation applicable on the date of the entry into force of thisConvention, bears to the total contributions due from  all the Members of the League.    2.  The  Council shall, as soon as possible, notify to the  various Governments the maximumannual liabilities which result for them from the provisions of paragraph 1.DRAFT CONVENTION ON FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.                       Preamble.
  G                                     SPECIAL  GUARANTEES.                                         Article 7.     Subject to the provisions of Article 10, a  High Contracting Party may accept the obligations of a special guarantor in respect of the  Government of any  of his territories.  Such Government is thereby constituted a special guarantor, and the guarantee which it accords to loans to be contracted in accordance with  the  present Convention shall be a special guarantee within the meaning of the present Convention, without  any further action or consent on the  part of the Government.                                         Article 8.     The special guarantees  are created  for the purpose of strengthening the security on which a loan contracted in accordance with the  present Convention is issued by ensuring that the service of such loan shall be guaranteed for its full amount, not merely by all the guaranteeing Governments as ordinary guarantors, but also by  a small number of Governments which, as special guarantors, will bear, within the limits of their special guarantees, the risk of any delay in the payment of the aniounts due from  any of the other  Governments as ordinary guarantors.  The amount covered by each special guarantee accordingly includes the amount of the Governments liability as an ordinary guarantor together with an additional amount, and it is determined, as provided below, in such manner that the total of the  additional amounts thus guaranteed by the special guarantor Governments will equal the total amount guaranteed by the Governments which are  ordinary guarantors only.   In the event  of a default by the borrowing Government on the service of the loan, the total amount covered  by a special guarantee is payable in full, but the sum paid by a special guarantor Government in excess of its liability as an ordinary guarantor is reimbursable, after the service has been  met, out of the balance of the amounts collected from the guaranteeing Governments.        .                   c&quot;                                         Article 9.     1.  Subject to the provisions of Article r8 regarding the payment of interest in the event of default, the annual liability which may fall to the charge of any special guarantor Government in respect of all the loans contracted in accordance  with the present Convention is limited  to a maximum which includes the Governments obligation as an ordinary guarantor and the additional amount covered by its special guarantee.  This maximum  shall be determined by dividing the sum total of the maximum obligations of all the Governments, as ordinary guarantors, among the special guarantor Governments in proportion to the contributions due from them to the  expenses of the League of Nations under the scale of allocation applicable on the date of entry into force of the present  Convention.     2.  The said maximum liabilities of the special  guarantor  Governments shall be notified to them by the Council of the League of Nations as soon as possible.  They shall be revised by the Council, in the event of any change in the number of  Governments which are ordinary guarantors or of those which are special guarantors, as soon as possible after such change has occurred.                                        Article 10.    The following Governments may be special guarantors under the present Convention:         (a)  The Governments  of permanent  Members of the Council of the League of  Nations;         (b)  The Governments  of other Members of the League which are unanimously invited    to become special guarantors by  those Governments which themselves are special guarantors.    Such invitation may be given either before or after  the entry into force of  the Convention.    Acceptance  of  the obligations of a  special guarantor may be intimated at the moment of signature or at that of ratification or at the moment of accession to the Convention, or subsequentlyby a declaration in writing deposited with the Secretary-General  of the League  of Nations, who shall notify such acceptance  to all the Members of the League.                                        Article 11.    The  Secretary-General of the League of Nations shall send to the Trustees provided for inArticle 12 a certified true copy of each notification of its maximum liability made to a Governmentin execution of Article 6 or  Article 9.                                        TRUSTEES.                                        Article 12.    1.  Upon the entry into force of the present Convention, the Council of the League of nations shall appoint five persons to act as Trustees of loans contracted in accordance with the Convention.The Trustees shall be nationals of the Swiss Confederation and habitually resident in Switzerland.
     2.  (a)   The Trustees shall be appointed for periods of five years.   At the end of their term of office, they may be reappointed for the like or any less period.  A Trustee may at any time resign on giving three months&apos; previous notice in writing to the Council of the League of Nations.     (b)  The Council of the.League of Nations may at any time remove a Trustee.     (c)  In the event of a vacancy occurring for any reason in the office of Trustee, the Council of the. League of Nations shall without delay appoint another Trustee.   If, in his opinion, it is necessary to do so, the Acting President of the Council may appoint a person to act  until the vacancy  is filled by the Council.     3.  (1)   The Trustees shall appoint from  their number a Chairman  and Deputy-Chairman and  draw up their rules of procedure subject to the provisions of the present Convention. Except in the  case mentioned in Article 15, paragraph 1, meetings shall be convened by the Chairman, or, if he is unable to act, by the Deputy-Chairman.     (2)  Three Trustees shall constitute a quorum.  All decisions may be taken by a majority; in case of equality of votes,  the presiding Trustee shall have a casting vote.     (3)  The Secretary-General of the League of Nations shall be entitled to be present or be represented  at all meetings of the Trustees.     (4)  The expenses incurred by the Trustees in executing their functions in connection withany loan and such honoraria for the performance of those functions as may be fixed by the Councilof the League of Nations shall be paid by the borrowing  Government.     (5)  The Council of the League of Nations may advance to the Trustees the amounts referredto in paragraph  (4); any sum  so advanced shall  be  repaid  to the League by  the  borrowingGovernment.     (6)  No Trustee shall  incur any  personal liability in  the execution of his  functions asTrustee, except for a breach  of his  duties knowingly and intentionally committed by  him.     (7)  The Trustees  shall report annually to the Council of the League of Nations upon  theexecution  of their functions as Trustees of each loan contracted in accordance with the presentConvention; they shall  be  entitled at any time to bring to the attention of the Council any difficulties experienced by them in performing such functions.AUTHORISATION  OF LOANS.                                        Article 13.    1.  Where the Council of the League of Nations decides, in virtue of Article i; that a HighContracting Party shall receive  financial  assistance under the  present Convention, it shallauthorise the Government of such High Contracting Party to issue a loan enjoying the ordinaryguarantees and the  special guarantees  resulting from the  Convention.  The Governments ofthose High Contracting Parties whom the Council declares to be involved in the war or threat of war shall be excluded from being guarantors.  The Council may exclude the ordinary guaranteeor special guarantee  of any Government if, in its opinion, it would not  be desirable that suchordinary guarantee or special guarantee should attach to the loan.    2.  (a)  The  maximum sum  to which the service of the  loan may amount in each yearshall be fixed by the Council.  The sum fixed by the Council shall be expressed in  gold francsas defined in Article  24, and, for  the purpose of determining the sum to which the  service mayamount in the currencies in which the loan is actually contracted, those currencies shall be treatedas being at the moment of signature of the loan  contracts on the legal parity with gold.    (b)   The annual  sum fixed for the service of the loan in any year shall not exceed the amount which can be covered  by special  as well as by  ordinary  guarantees without imposing  on any government a liability in excess of the maximum fixed by  the present  Convention.    (c)   The amount for each year of  each Governments liability as  an ordinary guarantorshall be determined by dividing the service of the loan among all the guaranteeing governments in the proportion of their maximum possible annual liabilities as ordinary guarantors underthis Convention, as fixed  by Article 6.   The total amount  covered by  each special guaranteeshall be determined  by dividing the said service among  the special guarantor Governments inthe proportion  of their maximum possible annual liabilities as special  guarantors as fixed by article 9.  For,the.purpose, however, of simplifying  the application of  the  special  guarantees,the Council, with the consent of the special guarantor Governments whose liabilities are affected,may make minor  fractional adjustments of the percentages attributable  to the special guarantorGovernments to the extent necessary to convert such percentages into convenient whole numbers.
    3.  For the purpose of the preceding provisions, no account shall be taken of the liability for interest which may result under the provisions of Article 18 from a default by a Governmentin meeting its obligations as an ordinary or as a  special guarantor.ISSUE OF AUTHORISED LOANS.                                        Article 14.    r.  The  Council shall require that the conditions and terms of  issue of a loan contractedin accordance with the present Convention, that is to say, inter alia, the method  of issue, the securities (if any) on which the loan is raised, the issue price, the rate of interest, the amortisation(including any stipulations as to repayment before maturity), the expenses of issue, negotiation and delivery, and the currency or currencies in which the loan is issued, shall be submitted forapproval to it or to a person or persons appointed by it for the purpose.   As provided in Article 13,paragraph  2, the currency or currencies in  which the loan is issued and in which  its service is payable shall, for the purpose of determining the maximum to which the service may amount,in every case be treated as being at the moment of  signature of  the loan contracts on  the legalparity with gold.  The arrangement made  by the Council with the  borrowing Government inquestion shall be embodied in a Protocol duly accepted by the  latter.    2.  The  loan shall not  possess the ordinary guarantees and special guarantees  resultingfrom  the Convention unless  the contracts relating to it  shall have been certified in writing bya person or persons appointed by the Council (such persons, if more than one, acting by a majorityif unanimity is not secured) to be in conformity with the decisions of the Council and the Protocolprovided for by  paragraph  1 above and the provisions  of the  present Convention.  A  signedduplicate of the certificate shall be delivered to the  Secretary-General of the League of nations for communication to the Trustees, together with copies of each contract authenticated by the borrowing  Government in sufficient number to enable him to send one to each Trustee.    3.  The  following provisions shall be obligatory in  all cases:    (a) The Trustees appointed under the present Convention, acting as provided  therein, shallbe Trustees of the loan  for all purposes for which Trustees are appointed, and in particular shall make all payments for interest or amortisation due on the loan out of the funds supplied by the borrowing Government  or, in the event of its default, by the Governments guaranteeing the loanas special or ordinary guarantors.    (&amp;) Except in the case of short-term credits of a currency not exceeding two years,  a reserveshall  be constituted in the hands of the Trustees by the direct  transfer to them by the issuinghouses out of the yield  of the loan of an amount sufficient to pay one-half of the annual serviceof the loan as issued.  Any sums drawn from this reserve by the Trustees shall immediately be refunded to them by the borrowing Government.    (c) The borrowing Government shall provide the Trustees with the  funds necessary to meetthe service of the loan in time of war as well as in time of peace.   Such remittances shaU be in thehands of the Trustees not later than thirty days before  each payment falls  due.DEPOSIT OF BONDS IN RESPECT OF PARTICULAR LOANS.                                        Article 15.    1.  As soon as possible after a contract for the issue of all or part of an authorised loan hasbeen certified in accordance with Article 14, paragraph 2, the Trustees, convened by the Secretary-General of the  League of Nations, shall examine the contract and the relevant decisions of theCouncil and ascertain  and notify to the Governments whose guarantees attached to  the loan:         (a)  What is the total amount of each payment due in respect of that issue in each year;         (b)  What is the maximum sum for which each Government, whether it be an ordinary    or a special guarantor, may be liable as an ordinary guarantor in respect of each such payment;         (c)  What is the maximum sum for which each special guarantor Government may be    liable as a special guarantor in  respect of  each such payment.    The sums mentioned in (b) and (c) shall be  determined in the manner provided in Article 13,paragraph 2 (c).
    OPERATION OF THE ORDINARY GUARANTEES AND SPECIAL GUARANTEES IN THE EVENT OF                        DEFAULT BY THE BORROWING GOVERNMENT.                                        Article  16.    1.  (a)  The  service of  loans contracted in  accordance with the present Convention shallalways continue to be primarily a charge upon  the borrowing Government.  The guaranteesprovided under the Convention shall enter into operation only if, and to the extent to which, the trustees  are neither provided with the necessary  funds by the borrowing Government nor  ableto meet the service out of the reserve constituted in accordance with Article 14, paragraph 3 (b).    (6)   In such  a case, the Trustees shall call simultaneously on all the guaranteeing Govern-ments, whether they be ordinary or special guarantors.  They shall apply the yield of the callsto meet the service of the loan and shall then reimburse to the special guarantor Governmentspro rata out of the balance of such yield the amounts paid by them in excess of their liabilities asordinary guarantors.  Delay by a guarantor Government in meeting a call is recognised as creating a duty to compensate special guarantor Governments as provided in Articles 18  and 20 for the prejudice caused to them by the resulting delay in the reimbursement of the amounts paid bythem  in excess of their  liability as ordinary guarantors.    (c)   All amounts  obtained  by the Trustees from  the guaranteeing Governments, with theexception of the amounts reimbursed as contemplated in paragraph (b) and of amounts paid tothem  by way of interest under Article 18, shall constitute a debt due, with  interest,  from the borrowing Government.    id)   The habihties between Governments which result from the present Convention shall besettled through the intermediary of the Trustees.    2.  The principles set out in paragraph 1 shall be applied in accordance with the provisionsof Articles 17  to  21 below.                                        Article 17.    1.   In the event of a default by the borrowing Government in providing funds to pay theannual service of an authorised loan,  the Trustees shall draw on the  reserve constituted  byapplication of Article  14, paragraph 3 (b), until that reserve is exhausted.  They shall at oncenotify the default to the Governments whose ordinary guarantees or special guarantees attach to the loan.  They shall likewise notify any payments into the reserve.    2.   If, thirty days before the date at which a payment for interest or amortisation falls due,the Trustees have neither received from the borrowing Government nor possess in the reservesufficient funds to make the payment, they shall inform each guarantor Government of the amountof the deficiency and the amount for which it will be liable if the deficiency is  not made good.If, twenty days before the due date of the payment, the Trustees still are unable to make it in full,they shall present for payment those coupons of the ordinary guarantee and special guaranteebonds which cover the service payment in question.  If the  deficiency is not total, the Trusteesshall reduce pro rata the amounts which they call upon the guarantor Governments to pay on the    2.  Within four months of the receipt of the above notification, each Government, according as it is solely an ordinary guarantor or a special guarantor, shall deposit to the order of the Trusteeswith the National Bank of Switzerland, or elsewhere  as requested by the Trustees, either an&quot; Ordinary Guarantee Bond &quot; in the form given in Annex I,  or a &quot; Special Guarantee Bond &quot; inthe form given in Annex II, bearing a separate coupon for each payment for which the Governmentmay be liable  in each year. The coupons shall be expressed and be payable in the currency inwhich payment is due to the bondholders. If the issue is made in more than one currency, separatebonds shall  be deposited in respect of the service due in each currency.    3.  The coupons of the said bonds shall be payable at an address satisfactory to the Trusteesfixed by the Government.    4.  The omission to deposit bonds as provided above shall in no way affect the  obligations of the Governments, whether as ordinary or as special guarantors,  or prevent the issue of theloan on the security of the ordinary guarantees and special guarantees which attach to it in virtueof the present  Convention.
said coupons and the coupons shall be endorsed accordingly.   If a guarantor Government has notyet deposited its bond as required by Article 15, the Trustees shall nevertheless call upon it andit shall be liable to make the payment due from it.    3.  The calls  which are made by the  Trustees  upon the ordinary guarantor and specialguarantor Governments shall be paid immediately by the  said Governments to  the  Trusteesnotwithstanding that they may be at war with the borrowing Government  or.with any country or countries in which a part of the loan has been issued, and notwithstanding that the holders of any or all of the bonds of the series of the loan in the service of which the default has occurredmay be subjects  of, or resident in, a country or countries with which they are at war.    4. , The Trustees shall meet the service of the loan out of the yield of the calls made upon theGovernments and  shall apply the balance, and their receipts from any calls which are paid at alater date,  to reimbursing  pro  rata to the special guarantor  Governments the  amounts paid bythem in excess of their liabilities as ordinary guarantors.                                        Article 18.       an ordinary guarantor or special guarantor Government fails to meet in full a call by the trustees by a date not later than ten days before the interest or amortisation payment in questionfalls due, the Trustees shall charge the said Government, and the Government shall pay to them,compound interest on the amount in arrears at the rate fixed  by Article 20.  This charge shall beconsidered as interest due to those special guarantor Governments which met their obligations bythe said date, in consideration of the fact that the delay was  calculated to retard payment of the sums reimbursable to them, and the sums received shall be paid over to the said special guarantorGovernments in  proportion to the amount paid by  them in excess of their liabilities as  ordinaryguarantors.                                        Article 19.    1.  The amount of each default by the borrowing Government in meeting a guaranteedpayment  due  on a  loan  shall constitute a  debt  of that  Government  to the  Trustees,bearing compound interest, at  the rate mentioned in Article 20,  as from the date  at which theGovernment was due to provide the Trustees with the funds necessary for the service of the loan.    2.  The payments received by the Trustees from the  borrowing Government after it hasdefaulted in meeting the guaranteed service of its loan  shall, if necessary, be applied in the firstinstance to  making good any arrears in the guaranteed service of the loan  which have occurred,notwithstanding  the ordinary guarantees  and  special guarantees  provided by the  presentConvention, and, secondly, to reconstituting the reserve provided for by Article 14,  paragraphs (6).Subject to this provision, any  amounts not required for meeting the  current service of the loanshall be used to reimburse to the special guarantor and ordinary guarantor Governments, with theappropriate interest, the amounts which they have furnished to meet defaults in the service of theloan and which  have not been reimbursed to them.  Each  Government shall be entitled  to be reimbursed  the sum paid by it in the capacity of an ordinary guarantor with compound interest at the rate mentioned in Article 20, as from the date of its payment to the Trustees.  Each specialguarantor Government shall, in addition, be entitled to receive the amount paid in excess of itsliability as  an ordinary guarantor, together with its share of any interest chargeable to  otherGovernments under Article 18.   Priority shall be given to reimbursement to  the special guarantorGovernments of the amounts paid by them in excess of their liabilities as ordinary guarantors,and the sums due in respect of earlier defaults shall be met in full before any payment is made inrespect of later  defaults.   Subject to the above provisions,  the reimbursement shall be effectedpro rata to the sums due to the various Governments.     3.  A reimbursement to the special guarantor Governments effected under paragraph 2 shallcancel pro rata  the  claims of  these  Governments  against  other  ordinary  or  special  guarantorGovernments.  The  Trustees shall determine what liabilities are  extinguished or reduced andnotify the Governments concerned.                                        Article 20.     The compound  interest provided for in  Articles 18  and 19 shall be calculated half-yearlyand shall be at a rate one per cent higher than the rate of interest payable on the guaranteed loan,or, if the loan was issued in several series, on the particular series in the service of  which thedefault occurs.                                        Article 21.     All questions arising in  the execution of Articles 15 to  20 inclusive shaU  be settled by the trustees, subject to appeal by any Government concerned to  the Council of the League of Nations,whose decision shall be final.  The appeal to the Council shall not suspend the execution of the trustees&apos; decision.          ,   GUARANTEE OF STATES  NOT MEMBERS OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.

- r8                                            IV.EXTRACT  FROM THE MINUTES OF THE FIFTY-FOURTH SESSION OF THE COUNCIL                            OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS                                 SIXTH MEETING  (PUBLIC).                   Held at Geneva on Friday, March 8th, 1929, at 10.30 a.m.                               President:  M. SCIALOJA (Italy).    Present: All the representatives of the Members  of the Council, and the Secretary-General.Finland was represented first by M. Procope and then by M. Holsti.  Roumania was representedfirst by M. Antoniade and then by M. Titulesco.2390.  Report of the Financial Committee on the Work of its Thirty-fourth Session.     (M.  Carapanos, representative  of  Greece, M.  Bouroff, representative  of  Bulgaria, andM. de Chalendar, Chairman of the Financial Committee, came to the Council Table.)     M. DE AGUERO Y BETHANCOURT read the foUowing report and draft resolutions:     &quot; Apart from the report concerning the loan of the Saar Governing Commission, which willbe laid before the Council by the representative of Italy, the Financial Committee submits to ustwo reports, one on Financial Assistance (document C80.1929, Extract)  and the other on various questions examined by the Financial Committee during  its thirty-fourth  session  (documentC.80.1929, Part I).     &quot; I desire to draw the Councils  special attention to the first of these documents, i.e., thereport  on financial assistance.   In conformity with the wish expressed last  September by theAssembly and by the Council, the Committee has drawn up a complete draft Convention.   this document is of great importance and  marks a new stage in the preparation of mutual  financialassistance.   Henceforward we shall be able to base our discussions on a concrete and definite text.     &quot; It is clearly impossible for the Council to pronounce at once on the details  of the  draft,which the Financial Committee was only able to present a day or two ago.  All that we can  do forthe moment is to request the Secretary-General to send the draft  Convention to all the  states members of the League of Nations, as decided  last September, in order that their governments may be able to give instructions to their delegates to the next Assembly, when the whole question will be debated.     &quot; You all know the main outlines  of the plan of financial assistance; they  have not been modified in the present draft.  The latter is  based on discussions which have already taken placein different organs of the League.   I shall therefore not take up your  time by giving you a detailedaccount of all the clauses of the draft Convention. - You will find a  very clear and concise summaryof them in the introduction which  precedes the  Convention.     &quot; Nevertheless I feel I should take this opportunity of emphasising once more the greatimportance of the plan of financial assistance.  The Members of the Council  will  remember thatthe idea  on which this draft is based was that of guaranteeing to States the possibility of securingrapid and effective financial assistance in case of war or threat of war, so as to increase materiallytheir feeling of security, and thereby enable them to limit their armaments  or even to refrain fromcreating  war industries.  Moreover, the possibility of setting in motion the machinery of financialassistance would  considerably increase the choice of measures open to  the Council in case of a crisis.  A country meditating attack on another would more than ever hesitate to carry it out ifthere were a risk that this other State might receive financial assistance from Members of the League.     &quot; It will be clear from these political considerations that the  plan goes far beyond the limits of a purely financial and technical  question.   Consequently, in drawing up its plan, the FinancialCommittee has not been able to  confine itself to making strictly financial proposals, but has been obliged to touch  upon certain  political questions.  The Financial  Committee points out  in  itsreport that it is well aware that these questions will have to be examined by  the proper authorities,and that.financial considerations cannot be the  only ones at issue.   On the other hand, the Com-mittee observes that political solutions have a direct influence on the financial possibilities and theefficiency of the plan, and therefore their financial aspects must  equally be taken into  account.     &quot; It is incumbent upon the political authorities of the various countries to examine the draftbefore us.  It is for them to take the next step.   It is clearly desirable that they should give suchinstructions to the delegates to the next Assembly as will enable the plan  for financial assistanceto be carried out with  the co-operation of the greatest possible number  of countries.
&quot; I beg to move the following resolutions :    &quot; &apos; The Council:    &quot; &apos; Thanks the Financial Committee for its-most valuable work in preparing the draftConvention on Financial Assistance;    &quot; &apos; Regards this draft as highly important, and hopes that the plan for financial assistancemay be adopted with the co-operation of the greatest  possible number of countries;    &quot; &apos; Requests  the  Secretary-General to communicate the  draft Convention to all  theStates Members of the League, and,    &quot; &apos; Invites the various Governments to examine the draft Convention  with the closestattention, and to give such instructions to their delegates to the tenth ordinary session of theAssembly that an exhaustive examination of the draft Convention may  be pos*sible in  thecourse  of that session.&apos;                             &quot;II.   Other Questions.&quot;    M. ZALESKI, while associating himself with the resolution proposed by the Rapporteur, wishedto express his satisfaction at the coming into force of the draft Convention on Financial assistance which would mark a step towards putting into practice, although in a partial and fragmentary way,Article 16 of the Covenant.  He was also glad  to note that some suggestions made in the Polishmemorandum, which had  been submitted to the Financial Committee  in 1927, had been founduseful in the preparation of the draft Convention.    M. PROCOPE, as representative of Finland, which had first put forward the idea of the systemof financial assistance, an idea which had later become one of the common tasks of the League,wished first to offer to the Rapporteur his thanks for his very skilful and interesting report.    He had at the same time great pleasure in expressing in particular to the Financial Committeeand the Economic and Financial Section of the Secretariat, as well as to its distinguished Director,Sir Arthur Salter, his sincere gratitude for the  great interest  they had taken in the investigation of the question of a first form of financial assistance  and for the very valuable work which had resulted in the precise and interesting draft Convention that  had just been communicated to theCouncil.    As the Governments would have an opportunity of studying the draft closely, and of intimatingtheir views at the next ordinary session of the Assembly, M. Procope did not wish to say anything in anticipation of the detailed considerations which his Government would present.  In view of theimportance of the question and of the extremely elaborate and detailed stipulations contained inthe draft, M. Procope would find it impossible to give the text any detailed examination  at  themoment.    While, in his personal capacity, he approved the draft in its main lines, he would ask per-mission to submit a few prima facie general comments,  which should not be taken as prejudginghis Governments final attitude.  It was  with great satisfaction that  he  noted that the draftConvention was based on two fundamental considerations which, in his view,  were of very greatpractical  value.    The first of these considerations was that, if the Convention were to be really efficacious, it mustcarry with it an assurance that  a State threatened by an aggression  would  be certain that itcould rapidly obtain financial assistance in the form of a considerable sum of  money in the eventof its credit being jeopardised on the money  market.   He wished to  make it  clear that, whilethe Financial Committee had found it impossible to fix any definite sum for the proposed guarantee,it had nevertheless laid emphasis on the point  that the plan  should provide for a relatively large amount which would correspond to the object of the Convention.    The  second fundamental consideration in the plan prepared by  the  Committee was that financial assistance should be obtained as promptly as possible, in virtue of a decision to be takenby the Council.    As regards the scope of the proposed Convention, the stipulation of  Article 1 to the effectthat the financial assistance prescribed should be granted not only in cases of war but also in casesof threat of war should be hailed with satisfaction.  This provision was of great practical value and emphasised at the same time the essentially preventive  object of the Convention, an objectwhich was in conformity with the fundamental conception of  the whole work  of the league and  which was calculated to strengthen  the  general feeling of security.    M. Procope considered that another great advantage lay  in the fact  that  under the termsof Article 2 of the draft, in addition to long-term loans, provision was made for the possibilityof short-term advances.   Certain comments might perhaps be made on  this subject, but he wouldomit them for the moment as they related to points of detail.    Obviously, the plan  for financial assistance  involved  certain political  and constitutional questions, which the Financial Committee was not competent to answer. The fundamental questionwhich arose was what would be the relations between the Convention on Financial Assistance andthe general system of disarmament, when the  time came for the final preparation and putting into  force of the Convention.    Without wishing to enter upon an examination of that question, M. Procope desired to call tomind the opinion that had been expressed by various delegates at the last session of the Assembly,namely, that a special Convention on financial assistance should be concluded,  such a convention to be brought at some future date within the general programme to be drawn up by the League for
the limitation  and reduction of armaments.  M.  Procope would confine himself to these fewremarks on the draft.    In conformity with the resolution adopted by the Assembly on September 18th, 1928, theRapporteur had proposed that the draft Convention drawn up by the Financial Committee shouldbe submitted to the Governments in order that they might give their instructions  to their delegates to the next,ordinary session of the Assembly.  M.  Procope was convinced that the governments would give the draft the exhaustive and favourable examination that it deserved.  He hoped thatthey would find it possible to give their delegates to the next session of the Assembly positiveinstructions of a kind that would favour the carrying out of the plan for the conclusion of a Con-vention concerning a first measure of financial assistance to be afforded in case of war or threat of war.    MY BRIAND, as representative of France, felt the greatest  satisfaction at the  draft that hadbeen submitted to the Council.  That draft did the greatest honour to the  Financial Committeewhich had prepared it  and to the Rapporteur who had presented&apos; it to the Council. Obviously, itwas outside the technical work which the Financial Committee was accustomed  to do, and it was within the very important and wide political sphere of the  practical organisation of peace.  Assuch it deserved the Councils attention, and M. Briand hoped that the States Members of the Leaguewould give it an exhaustive examination which would lead to  practical results at the next ordinarysession of the Assembly.    The draft was not, however, solely of interest  to the Members of the League,  but, by reasonof its  idealism and of the object with which it had been framed  and which was M. Briand wouldrepeat an  object of peace, it concerned  all countries interested in the maintenance of peace.He thought that it might be useful at some stage to submit the draft for investigation to countriesnot Members of the League in order that they might  have an opportunity of furthering, by their approval, the resolutions to be adopted by the League.    Sir Austen CHAMBERLAIN associated himself with the hope expressed by the representativeof France that the Financial Committee&apos;s proposal, when given  its final form, would be submittedto other nations besides those which were Members of the League.   As regards the attitude of hisGovernment, he ventured to remind the Council that the British Government had been the first to accept in principle  the proposal which had been  initiated by  the representative  of Finland,and he could promise on its behalf a careful and sympathetic  study of the proposals submittedby the Financial Committee.    M. PROCOPE wished merely to associate himself with what had been said by the French andBritish representatives in regard to the general character of the draft Convention and its relation-ship to the States that were not Members of the  League.   Furthermore, he wished to express the gratitude of those who had initiated the^scheme for the,support  they had received from theother  Powers, and in particular from Great Britain.                       .........    The first draft resolution proposed by the Rapporteur and relating to financial assistance was adopted.
