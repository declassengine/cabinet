AS  directed  by  the Prime  Minister,  we  have  considered  the  attached memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. 45 (30))  on the subjectof the proposed new Treaty with Iraq.    2.  The Chief of the Air Staff has been closely associated with the drafting ofthe Memorandum of Proposals for an Anglo-Iraq settlement (Annexure II) and thecovering despatch to the High Commissioner for Iraq (Annexure I), and we haveno observations of importance to make on these documents in their present form.    There are, however, two minor points to which we would invite attention.Proposal No. 7 (Annexure II).    3.  In this proposal it is stated that  His Majesty the King of Iraq authorisesHis Britannic Majesty to maintain upon  Iraq territory  ....  such  forces as HisBritannic Majesty considers  necessary for those purposes, provided that  no  major changes in the strength of these forces shall be made at any time without previous consultation with His Majesty the King of Iraq.    4.  It might well be necessary in certain emergencies either to reduce or increase our forces in Iraq temporarily, for example, for purposes connected with the defenceof Imperial interests  elsewhere than in Iraq, and  although it is  not  clear that theabove proviso would debar us in the last resort from taking such action, except withthe agreement of the  King of Iraq, such an interpretation might well be  advanced by the latter.    5.  We therefore suggest  that  the words printed in italics above should be omitted from Proposal No. 7.  In making this suggestion we  would point out that proposal No. 7 corresponds to Section 9  of the proposals for an Anglo-Egyptiansettlement (Command Paper  3376), and  that.in the latter there is no  restriction onthe size of the forces  wdiich His Britannic Majesty may consider it necessary tomaintain in Egypt.Proposals in regard to Military Matters (First Appendix, Section (B)).    6.  We observe that while provision is contained in  this Section for training facilities for military  aircraft, training facilities for British land forces are not mentioned.  We therefore suggest that the words  &quot;and land  forces on&quot;  should beinserted between &quot;aircraft over&quot; and &quot;Iraq&quot;  in the last line of this section.

ENCLOSURE[CP.  45  (30).!CABINET.NEW TREATY WITH IRAQ.          MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    IN conformity with the  conclusions reached by the Cabinet at their meetingof the 9th September last, I have caused to be prepared, and now circulate for theconsideration  of  my  colleagues,  a memorandum, with  annexures,  formulatingdetailed proposals for a new  Treaty to regulate the relations between  this countryand Iraq when the latter enters the League of Nations.   These proposals have been drawn up in  consultation with  the other interested  Departments.   I concurgenerally  in the  recommendations now submitted  and in the terms of the draft despatch of instructions, which it is proposed to address to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.    2.  The  accompanying documents  have necessarily  taken  some  considerable time to prepare.  Many important and delicate questions were involved, demandingclose  and careful examination, and the present measure  of  agreement was onlyreached after prolonged interdepartmental discussion.  As a result, some five months have  elapsed   since His Majesty&apos;s  Government  announced their  intention  of concluding a  new treaty with the Iraq  Government.   In the  meantime,   publicopinion in Iraq has grown restive at the delay and not a little suspicious  of the intentions of His  Majesty&apos;s Government.  The Iraq  Government have  frequentlybeen questioned on the subject in the local Parliament, and have found it increasingly difficult to satisfy their supporters that the delay in opening negotiations does not imply any change of policy on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    Furthermore, the  High Commissioner for Iraq has recently represented thatcertain matters of urgency and importance, indirectly connected with the negotiation of the newr Treaty, are pending, and that, in the absence of any indication  of thetreaty policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, no progress toAvards a  settlement ofthese is possible.   He presses for early instructions.    It  seems  clear  that the  good impression created by  the  announcement ofSeptember last is beginning to wear rather thin, and that if negotiations are delayedmuch longer thev will be carried out in an unfavourable  atmosphere, which mayseriously  prejudice the outcome.   Consequently,  it  is  important  that the HighCommissioner should, as soon as possible, be placed in a position to open negotiationswith the Iraq Government. I trust, therefore, that the Cabinet will, give this mattertheir  urgent consideration in  order  that full instructions may be issued  to theHigh Commissioner at the earliest possible date.                                                                          P.February 10, 1930.
                       NEW  TREATY  WITH  IRAQ.     On the 9th September the  Cabinet decided that  the draft of a  Treaty to be concluded with the Iraq Government prior to Iraq&apos;s admission to the League shouldbe prepared in consultation between the Foreign Office and  the Colonial Office, andthat the draft Treaty should then be submitted to  the Cabinet  for examination inits political aspects.  Subsequently the Cabinet decided  that the Treasury and theAir Ministry should also be consulted in the preparation  of the draft Treaty.     2.  The   accompanying   Memorandum   of  Proposals,  with   appendices(Annexure 2), has accordingly been drawn up as a- result of discussions between thefour  Departments concerned.   It was originally prepared, in  accordance  with instructions of the Cabinet, in the form of a draft Treaty; but the amended form,as now submitted, wras subsequently adopted as the result of a suggestion made bythe Air Ministry.  It was thought  desirable at the same  time to frame a draft despatch of instructions to the High Commissioner for Iraq; this draft despatch isalso submitted (Annexure 1).  Appended to the draft despatch will be found a draft memorandum  (Annexure 3) setting out the assurances which it is suggested the IraqGovernment should be prepared to give when applying for admission to the Leagueof Nations.     The draft despatch contains a fairly full explanation of the origin and purposeof the present proposals.  There are, however, one or two questions of principle, not expressly dealt with in the draft despatch, which call  for special mention.     3.  In  the first place, it  will be  seen that provision has  been  made  for thecontinued presence of British  Forces in Iraq after Iraq enters the  League ofNations.*  On this point the  Departments were without any clear guidance fromthe Cabinet; but as His  Majesty&apos;s  Government had announced that it  was their intention that the proposed new Treaty with Iraq should be on  the general lines ofthe recent proposals for an Anglo-Egyptian settlement  (Cmd. 3376),  and as those proposals contemplated the retention of a British  garrison in Egypt, the Depart-ments have proceeded on  the assumption that it was the  wish of His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment that British Forces shoidd similarly be retained under the new  treaty in Iraq.  There are,  moreover, the most cogent reasons  of  Defence Policy for theretention of British Air Forces in Iraq.  In our Imperial Air  Defence Policy-asin the sphere  of  commercial aviation Iraq  occupies  a  key position  similar in practically every respect to that held by the Suez Canal in our maritime policy.  TheAir  Ministry  have represented that the severance of the vital link in the chain ofair routes to the East, so  far from  diminishing the forces necessary  for ImperialDefence overseas,  would mean that  the  standard of air  strength to be maintainedboth East and West of Iraq wrould have to be correspondingly increased, since thesystem of inter-reinforcement upon which the security  of those regions is now basedwould become  impossible.   Iraq at present affords an ideal training station, containspermanent accommodation constructed at considerable cost to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, and represents the only possible place d&apos;armes for the location of the  centralreserve upon  which  is  based the  strength  and  disposition  of our Air  forces overseas.     Apart from its strategical value, the air route through Iraq is the main trunk road over which must pass the commercial air traffic and mails  to India, Australiaand  the Far East, and we must be in a position to safeguard that route.     Moreover, the presence of a strong British air force in Iraq affords an importantmeasure of security to the great  industrial enterprises in the South  Persian oilfields.and in the Persian Gulf, and acts as a deterrent to the several possibilities of actionhostile to the British Empire in  Persia and Arabia generally, and as a check to any threat to India from Central Asia.    4.  Provision is  made (proposal  2) for  an exchange  of  Ministers  (notAmbassadors)   with  Iraq.  The  disadvantages inherent  in such an  arrangement,together with  the  objections which would attach to the  alternative of an exchangeof Ambassadors, are briefly mentioned in the draft despatch to the High Commis-sioner,  But it should be explained that it was  with  some reluctance that  theColonial Office finally deferred to the view of the Foreign Office that an exchangeof Ambassadors could not be contemplated without the risk of great difficulties.  Thenature of such difficulties  will be readily understood; it might, for example, have unfortunate effects were the Ambassadors of great Powers, such as the United States   * The excess  cost of the British garrison in Iraq and of the subsidy paid  to&apos; the Iraq Army amounts atthe present time to apprtximately  472,000 p&apos;ir annum.      [20576]                                                       b 2
of America or France, called upon  to  yield precedence  to an Iraqi Ambassadorbecause of his earlier arrival in London.  On the other hand, it must be rememberedthat the proposal to exchange Ambassadors with Egypt has been published to theworld.  That being  so, it is unlikely that the Iraq  Government, who regard theircountry as no less advanced than Egypt, will be content to exchange Ministers only.Indeed, the vernacular press in Iraq is already demanding the appointment of aBritish Ambassador.  The reasons which  prompted the  proposal  that  we  shouldexchange Ambassadors with Egypt, viz., the necessity for ensuring the predominanceof  British  influence  and  for guarding  against  undue foreign  penetration orinterference, apply equally to the case of  Iraq.  On the other hand, the populationof Egypt is 14 millions, and that of Iraq 3 millions;  as  regards trade, Egypfsimports from the United Kingdom are 21 - 8 per cent, out of a total of 53 millionssterling, and her exports to the United Kingdom 38-3 per cent, out  of a total of57 millions sterling, whilst Iraq&apos;s  imports from this country are 34-4 per cent, outof a total of 7-3 millions sterling, and her exports to this country 26-6 per cent.out of a total  of 4-2  millions sterling.   Sir Francis Humphrys, with whom thisquestion was discussed before he left to take up his appointment in Iraq, stronglyfavoured the proposal  that this country should be represented by an Ambassador at baghdad, not by a Minister only.  The former has, and the latter has not, the rightto claim a  personal  interview with the Sovereign to whom he is accredited.  our high Commissioner at present enjoys a similar right in  Iraq.  If he is succeeded by an Ambassador this right will be preserved; if not, it will apparently be forfeited.It is understood, however, that the Foreign Office do not attach much importance tothis formal right of audience, since His Majesty&apos;s Government would in any caseinsist  on their Representative  being treated  with  proper  consideration  in  thisrespect.     There  is  a  further point  to which even  greater  importance  is  attached.It is always possible that other&quot; countries, e.g., Turkey arid  Persia,  may appointAmbassadors at Baghdad.  In that event, it would be impossible for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to insist, as is contemplated in the case of Egypt, that the British repre-sentative should enjoy  the permanent status of  doyen of the local Diplomatic Body,and in the absence of some such arrangement he will eventually have to take second place to the representative of some other  foreign Power.     On the  other hand, the  considered  view  of the Foreign Office is that theappointment of an Iraqi Ambassador at the Court of St.  James would, in practice,render it impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to refuse to receive  Ambassadorsfrom any other independent State  in friendly relations with this country, with theultimate result that the British Legations abroad would, in  almost  every case, haveto be raised to the  status of Embassies, and  apart from the obvious diplomaticobjections to such a  development, the annual extra cost would be considerable.  Ifthis is so, an exchange of Ambassadors with Iraq must be regarded as impracticable.&apos;It might be  possible to argue that, on the grounds of intimacy of relations and^identity of interests, Iraq stands in a special position towards this country and  is entitled to exceptional treatment; but this  is not a line of argument that the ForeignOffice think that it would be practicable to adopt towards other Powers.     In any case,  it is  considered that the arguments for  and against the proposal should be placed before the  Cabinet.   - 5.  The memorandum of proposals, in its present form,  contains no admissionon the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government that full responsibility for  the maintenanceof internal order  in  Iraq will, in the future, rest with the Iraq Government.  Thelate Sir  Gilbert Clayton, in his despatch of the 22nd July last (a copy of which accompanied the memorandum circulated  to the Cabinet by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies on  the 3rd September, 1929 (CP.  239  (29)), explained that thisquestion of  responsibility wras  one of the main points at  issue with  the IraqGovernment;  and it is clear from  the  attitude which they  adopted  when theamendment  of the Military Agreement of 1924 was under consideration  that theIraq Government attach a quite disproportionate importance to obtaining a  formaladmission from His Majesty&apos;s Government that the era of divided &quot;responsibilityhas definitely ended.  Such an admission might seem unnecessary, having regard tothe  fact that  the proposed new  Treaty will  be concluded  with  a  State  which,ostensibly  at  least,  will  by  then  have  attained to  complete   and  sovereignindependence; but the  Iraq Government obviously attach  such great  importance to*this question that it is.possible that they may ask that an acknowledgment in termsof their responsibility  should be included in the proposed new Treaty.   In  that
event,  it  would  be  difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to Oppose  the  IraqGovernments request.  The Air Ministry, however, are opposed to the insertion orany such provision if it can possibly be avoided.  They hold the view that it might,in future, prove a source of embarrassment to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and would,moreover, imply that the Government of Iraq are,  in fact,  capable of guaranteeingthe internal  security of the  country without assistance  from  British  forces,  animplication which, in the decided view of the Air Staff, has no warrant in fact.  Intheir opinion, circumstances may well render it essential for British forces in iraq to intervene to quell civil disturbances, not only for their own immediate security,but in order to prevent the machinery of Government being  entirely dislocated, with consequent danger to the security of the essential air communications  and other british interests in the country.  They are, therefore, most averse from the inclusion in the proposed Treaty of any article which would definitely preclude the intervention of British forces except at the express  request of the Iraq Government,  since they feel that the effect of the inclusion of such an Article would be to prevent the inter-vention of British forces in the  incipient stages of trouble,  with the result that thesituation  would be  likely  to  get  completely out of control and beyond hope  ofsuppression without  the help of considerable reinforcements.    The  other Departments  feel,  however, that if Iraq  is  to be  set  up as  anindependent  State,  responsibility  for  the  preservation of order throughout thecountry must, at  least theoretically, rest  with the  Iraq  Government, and that anyintervention by British Forces (other  than in self-defence)  in the internal  affairs ofIraq, except at the express request of the Iraq Government, would be incompatible with her  position as  an independent State.    Moreover, the inclusion in the  Treaty of a formal acknowledgment of the IraqGovernments responsibility for maintaining internal  security  would serve otheruses than that of satisfying Iraqi  amour-propre.  It would, to some extent,  disarmthe critics in  this country, who are always clamouring for the liquidation of Britishcommitments in the Middle East and it might, in some measure, serve to  dispel the suspicion prevalent at Geneva that Iraq cannot yet stand on her own feet  and that,whatever may be their public  professions, His Majesty&apos;s Government really intend to maintain a veiled protectorate over the country.    In all the circumstances, it  is  thought best to furnish  Sir F. Humphrys with afull explanation of the apprehensions felt by the Air Staff and to inform him thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government would  prefer  that the proposed new Treaty should not...contain an express admission of the Iraq Governments responsibility, while at thesame time  giving him discretion to insert such an admission in the treaty shouldthe Iraq Government press for it and should he consider it  unwise or impracticable1to oppose their wishes.    6.    There is another point which should be brought to the notice of the Cabinet.In paragraph 13 of the Departmental Memorandum circulated to the Cabinet by theSecretary of  State for the Colonies on the 3rd September (CP. 239 (29))  it wassuggested that the Iraq Government might object to the presence  of  a foreigngarrison  so close to the capital of  Iraq  as the Hinaidi Aerodrome.  It was further suggested that, if the withdrawal  of  the British Forces to  a  greater distance  fromBaghdad  were regarded  as practicable, it might be  better  tactics to make  aspontaneous offer of such withdrawal to the Iraq Government.  Since that suggestion was made  the Air  Staff  have  explained that they attach the greatest  possibleimportance to the retention of the Hinaidi Aerodrome, without  which  they are convinced that it wrould be  impossible on military grounds to secure the purposes for which the British garrison is provided.  They even consider it doubtful Avhethera British garrison could be safely  retained  in Iraq at all if that aerudrome had tobe relinquished.   In deference to these views, Hinaidi  has  been  mentioned  in clause A of  the  military proposals (first appendix to  Annexure 2)  as one of the stations where His Majesty&apos;s Government  wish to retain forces in  Iraq.   It  is,however,  necessary to point out  that, if  the  Iraq Government pressed for theevacuation of Hinaidi,  His Majesty&apos;s Government would  have  to be prepared  tomeet the charge of inconsistency based on the contrast which would be drawn between their policy in  Egypt and their  policy in Iraq  in regard to the retention of troopsnear.to the respective capitals of  the two countries.  But  up to the present  time there has been no evidence to indicate that the Iraq Government propose to press forthe removal of  British forces from the Aerodrome  at Hinaidi.

ANNEXURE I.              Draft Despatch to the High Commissioner for Iraq.Sir-,    ON the 14th September, with the full authority of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentconveyed in my telegram No. 264 of the 11th September, the Iraq Government were informed, without proviso or qualification, that His Majesty&apos;s  Government wouldbe prepared to support  the  candidature of  Iraq  for  admission to the  League ofNations in 1932, and that at the next Session His  Majesty&apos;s  Government would inform the Council of the League of Nations that they had decided not to  proceedwith the unratified  Treaty of 1927,  but that  they proposed,  in accordance with article 3 (1) of  the  Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1926, to recommend  Iraq for admission to the League of Nations in 1932.  / The Iraq Government were also informed on the same occasion that, as it wouldbe necessary to  conclude a  Treaty before  1932 in  order  to regulate the relationsbetween the United  Kingdom and Iraq after the lattets  admission to the League,the necessary steps  would  be taken  to  prepare a  Draft  Treaty for that purpose,which would be  based generally upon the recent proposals for an  Anglo-Egyptiansettlement.    2.  .This despatch is not primarily concerned with the  first part of that message.As you  were informed in  my telegram No. 351 of the 8th of November,  formalnotification  has  already  been made  to  the  League Council  of  His Majesty&apos;governments intention to recommend Iraq for  admission  to the League of nations in 1932, and the time is not yet ripe to  translate into performance the first  part ofthe undertaking given  to the Iraq Government.  It is sufficient to say that HisMajesty&apos;s Government wish to add nothing to,  and to withdraw  nothing from, thatundertaking.   It was intentionally framed in unambiguous terms,  and it needs nogloss.    3.   It  is  rather with  the second part of the communication  to  the IraqGovernment, namely, the proposed new Treaty  to govern the relations between thiscountry and Iraq after Iraq enters the League, that the present despatch will deal.Before referring to the main objects which His Majesty&apos;s Government hope to securein the new  Treaty, it would be well to point to one essential  difference between thenew Treaty and those which have preceded it.  Hitherto, our Treaties with Iraq havehad a double purpose.  They have been intended both to preserve essential imperial interests in Iraq and to enable His Majesty&apos;s  Government effectively  to  discharge the international obligations  which  they have assumed in respect of Iraq.   Thelatter object  has hitherto been  predominant  in  the&quot; instruments  regulating therelations between  the two countries.   It  will find no place in  the  new  Treaty.Whatever engagements Iraq may be called upon to  assume on  becoming a member ofthe League of Nations, those engagements must in future be assumed towards theLeague.  His Majesty&apos;s Government can assume no responsibility whatever  for thedischarge of Iraq&apos;s international obligations  after  her  entry into  the League.Consequently,  in  framing  the settlement  between this  country  and  Iraq,  HisMajesty&apos;s Government propose to  confine  themselves to safeguarding imperial interests and  to  avoid all direct or indirect  responsibility  for the protection offoreign interests (other than British) in Iraq.    4.  The main objects to be secured in the new Treaty,  and the general principles which should govern the future relationship between the two countries, have  alreadybeen suggested in paragraphs 5 and 6  of  the  late Sir Gilbert  Clayton&apos;s despatch,Secret B., of the 22nd July.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are in full accord with theviews there expressed,  and they  have now given careful  consideration to the best means of attaining  those objects and of translating  those principles into treaty provisions.   As  a  result,  the  Memorandum of Proposals,   with  appendices,accompanying this despatch has been prepared  as a basis for  negotiation.  You willobserve  that these documents are to a large extent based upon the print containing the recent proposals for an Anglo-Egyptian settlement (Cmd. 3376),  copies of whichhave already been communicated to you.  Where possible, the  actual terminologyemployed in the  notes  exchanged with the Egyptian  Prime Minister has  Mutatis Mutandis been employed                                                 V
    5.  The reasons underlying the provisions of the accompanying proposals mayriot in every case be readily apparent, and it is hoped that the following commentarymay serve to make the origin and purpose of each article clear.Principal Memorandum.    Proposal 1 calls for no special comment.  As you will see,  it follows closely the wording of paragraph 2 of the Egyptian proposals.  The first  sentence, which doesnot appear in the Egyptian model,  is taken from Article 2 of the Anglo-Iraq Treatyof 1927.                                                 ,Proposal 2.    Provision is made for the establishment of diplomatic relations by the exchangeof Ministers; not, as in the Egyptian proposals, by the exchange of representativesof the rank of Ambassador. His Majesty&apos;s Government appreciate that the arrange-meht  contemplated is open to important  disadvantages.  A British Minister may find himself required to take  second place to the  representative in Iraq of someforeign Power holding the rank of Ambassador, or to some  foreign Minister whoseappointment  is of anterior date  to his  own.   A British Minister would  not,moreover,  as  would an Ambassador,  have  the absolute right in virtue  of his appointment  to claim audience of the King  of Iraq.  Furthermore,  it is possiblethat the Iraq  Government may  resent the fact  that, whereas  an  exchange of ambassadors is contemplated in the case of Egypt, an exchange of Ministers only isproposed in the case of Iraq.    Nevertheless,  while  fully  realising the objections to the proposed  proposal,His Majesty&apos;s  Government are unable at  present to contemplate the  appointmentof  an Iraqi  Ambassador in  London.   Such  an  appointment  would  seriouslycomplicate the diplomatic situation  at the Court of St.  James&apos;s, and would placeHis Majesty&apos;s  Government in  a most embarrassing position vis-a-vis  those powers in  whose  capitals  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  have  not  hitherto  establishedEmbassies.  I  am advised that if His Majesty&apos;s  Government were  to accept an ambassador from King Faisal it would in practice be impossible to deny the privilege of establishing  an Embassy in London to any other  independent Power.    An alternative  proposal,  which would not be open to any of the foregoingobjections,  has been advanced.  It has  been suggested that, on  the analogy of thearrangement  between France and Switzerland, His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldbe represented  in Baghdad by an Ambassador and the Iraq Government in london by a Minister.   If this  arrangement were adopted, it would  still be  necessary, inorder to safeguard the position of the British Ambassador  as permanent doyen ofthe diplomatic body at  Baghdad,  to call  upon the Iraq Government to undertake not to receive  any other  diplomatic representative of a higher  rank  than that of minister.   I imagine that such an arrangement would be regarded as derogatory,and would be unacceptable to public  opinion in Iraq, but, if  you consider that thereis any prospect of its acceptance,  you are  authorised to  put  the proposal before theIraq Government.Proposals 3 and 4.    These  proposals closely follow^ the Egyptian model and call for no comment.Proposal 5.    This proposal is in almost identical terms with paragraph  7 of  the Egyptianproposals.    It is clear from the  attitude  which the Iraq  Government  adopted when theamendment of  the Military Agreement of 1924 was under consideration,  and  also from paragraph 17 of Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s despatch of the  22nd of July last, thatthe Iraq Government have hitherto attached a quite disproportionate importance tothe question of the responsibility for the maintenance of internal security in Iraq.and the defence of Iraq  from external aggression.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have.therefore given careful consideration to the question of including in the Treaty whichis to govern the future relations between this country and Iraq a definite admissionon the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government that full responsibility for the maintenance
of internal order in Iraq will in futui^e rest writh the Iraq Government, and that theera of divided responsibility  has  definitely ended.  Such an admission might seemunnecessary, having&apos; regard to the fact that the  proposed new Treaty  will  be concluded with a State which, on the entry  into force  of the Treaty,  will haveattained, ostensibly at least,  to complete and sovereign independence.  But, as theIraq Government obviously attach great importance to the question, it.is possible thatthey may ask that an acknowledgment in terms of their responsibility in the mattermay be included in the proposed new  Treaty.  In that event it might be difficult torefuse their  request! .     On the  other hand,  such an admission might prove a source of embarrassment toHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the future,  and would, moreover, imply that the IraqGovernment are, in fact, capable of guaranteeing the internal security of the country without the assistance of British forces.   I am advised that this implication is not one that can be accepted, and that the forces at present at the disposal of the. IraqGovernment are  not  adequate for the purpose in&quot; view.   It is possible, therefore,that circumstances might arise which would render it essential for British forces inIraq (the question of the presence of British forces in Iraq is dealt with in connectionwith Proposal 7  below) to intervene to quell civil disturbances, not only  for theirown immediate security, but in order to prevent the machinery of Government beingentirely dislocated, with consequent  danger to the security of essential  air com-munications and  to  other British interests in  Iraq.  From this  point  of view,therefore, it is preferable  that the proposed new Treaty  should  contain  nothing which would definitely preclude the intervention of British forces except at the express request of the Iraq Government,  since the effect of such a provision mightbe to prevent the intervention of British  forces in the incipient stages of disorder,with the result that the situation might  pass completely out of control and beyondhope of suppression without the help of considerable reinforcements.     It might be held, on the other hand, that if Iraq is to be set up as an independent state, at least nominal responsibility for the preservation of order throughout thecountry must rest with the Iraq  Government, and that any intervention by british forces (other  than in self-defence) in the internal  affairs  of  Iraq, except at the express request of the Iraq Government,  would be incompatible with her  status asan independent State.  ^   I have  thought it  well  to invite your attention to the various considerations affecting the question which His Majesty&apos;s Government have had in mind in reaching a decision.  They have decided that, in  all the circumstances, it is preferable thatthe  proposed new Treaty  should not contain an express admission  of  the IraqGovernments  responsibility  in  the  matter.  At the  same time, however,  HisMajesty&apos;s Government are  prepared to leave you discretion to agree to the insertion of such a provision  in the Treaty if the Iraq  Government press  for it  and youconsider that no other course is practicable.  .   If such a provision should prove to be necessary, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould suggest that it should appear as an additional paragraph of Proposal 5, andthat it should be  worded on the following lines :          &quot; Nevertheless, it is understood between  the High Contracting Parties that     full responsibility for the maintenance of internal order in Iraq and, subject to     the  provisions of the present clause, for the defence  of  Iraq from  external     aggression, rests with His Majesty the King of Iraq.&quot;Proposal  6.     This proposal  is based upon paragraph 8 of the  Egyptian  proposals  and sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) of the British Note on the subject of the Army.Proposal 7.     As you will see, this proposal, which is based upon paragraph 9 of the Egyptianproposals, provides for the retention in Iraq of a British Garrison after Iraq entersthe League.  It is to  be hoped that the Iraq Government,  as much in their  own interests as those of His Majesty&apos;s Government,  will be prepared to accept at least the principle of this provision, and the conversation between  King  Faisal  and major Young, reported in the latter&apos;s Secret despatch of the 14th October last, wouldcertainly seem to justify some degree of confidence on this score.   If, however, thishope proves to  be unfounded and the Iraq Government  definitely  decline to  con-
template the idea of British Forces  remaining in Iraq after 1932, then a serious situation will arise, and you should report to His Majesty&apos;s Government for further instructions.     There is one further  point  in connection with  this proposal which  demandsmention.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are in full agreement with the view expressedin paragraph 6.of Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s despatch of the 22nd July, that any groundtroops necessary for the protection of the Royal Air Force units remaining in Iraq,should hot be provided by the Iraq Army but should be entirely under British control.For  this purpose His. Majesty&apos;s Government wish to retain under the same degreeof British control as exists at present, the two remaining Battalions  of Levies.  Ifthe Iraq Government are prepared  to agree to this, the proposed Treaty settlementwill  presumably have to contain  provision to enable  His Majesty&apos;s Government tocontinue to recruit Iraqi subjects for service with the Levies.  The Iraq Governmenthave on occasion shown themselves dissatisfied with the present arrangement wherebypersons of Iraqi  nationality  are  serving in what are tantamount to British Units.and  they may well oppose  the retention of these Levy Battalions by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.  If  this proves to be  the  case, and the political  obstacles  to thecontinuance of  the present arrangement are found to be insuperable,  then it maybe necessary to introduce into Iraq an equivalent number of  Indian troops to replace the Levy Battalions.  His Majesty&apos;s Government would, however, be most reluctant to do this on account of the expense* and inconvenience involved, and you should do your utmost  to induce  the Iraq  Government  to allow  the existing  LevyBattalions to be retained on British charge.  If your efforts are unsuccessful, beforeacquiescing  in  any  other  arrangement you  should  report the  situation  to HisMajesty&apos;s Government and await instructions.Proposal 8.     This is based on paragraph 10 of the Egyptian proposals.  The second sentence,which is suggested by the Egyptian Note on Advisers, is intended to secure to HisMajesty&apos;s Government some control over the selection of British officials appointedto serve under the Iraq Government.  This is considered essential. As the numberof British officials  in  Iraq  decreases  and  the  Iraq  Government  become  moreindependent  of  external advice, the  choice of officials to fill the few remainingposts in the  Iraq Government Service open to  foreigners will acquire even a greater importance than  is now the case.     In view of the impatience of foreign control lately shown by the  Iraq.Govern-ment (as reflected in the  confidential programme of the present  Cabinet) and  ofthe recent Press  campaign in favour of  a  sweeping reduction of British officials,it was felt that it Avould be fruitless  to attempt to secure an undertaking from theIraq. Government to employ any given  number  of British officials.    The presentagitation probably derives  much of  its support from the fact that the  Iraq Govern-ment are  at present compelled  by Treaty to employ  British officials.  Once the element of compulsion is removed and the Iraq Government find that  they are free to employ as many or as few British officials as they like, it is to be hoped that thepresent artificial agitation will  subside, wiser counsels will  prevail  and the  IraqGovernment will  of their own free will turn once again to this country for militaryand  civil advisers in adequate numbers.     In the intervening  period your influence  with the Iraq Government should beused  to  restrain within  reasonable  limits  any  tendency towards   a wholesaledismissal of British officials.Proposal 9.     You will observe that  although mention is made of a second appendix dealingwith  financial matters, no  such  appendix actually accompanies this  despatch.  Ofthe important questions still at issue with the Iraq Government two only relate to finance, namely, the disposal of the Iraq Railways and of the Port  of Basra.  Itis to be hoped that both of these questions will be satisfactorily settled before theproposed new treaty enters into force.  If this hope is realised no special financial provisions will be required  and proposal 9 can  be omitted; if not, it will be necessaryto negotiate some instrument to provide a means of future settlement.  But at thepresent stage it would clearly be useless to attempt to  forecast what such instrumentshould contain.   *  It is estimated that the additional expenditure involved would amount, to some A&apos;30,000 per annum.       [20576]                                                          c
Proposals 10, 11 and 12.    These call  for ho special comment.Proposal  13.    This  provides that the proposed Treaty shall not enter into force until Iraq hasbecome a  member of the League of Nations.  It is possible that this provision willbe unwelcome to the Iraq Government, who apparently contemplate an earlier date for the entry into force of the new Treaty and for the complete emancipation  ofIraq.  But it is, I think, obvious that, until His Majesty&apos;s Government are formallyrelieved of  their responsibilities  towards the League  of Nations by the  admissionof Iraq to membership  of that body, they must retain the necessary Treaty powersto enable them to discharge those responsibilities.  The new treaty now contemplatedclearly would not provide them with  adequate powers for that purpose, and anytreaty which could be concluded and brought into force now would,  like the abortiveTreaty of 1927, necessarily be of a quasi-mandatory character, and thus unacceptable to public  opinion in Iraq.     As in the Egyptian model, revision of the terms of the treaty  by agreement atthe end of 25 years is contemplated.Proposal  14 is purely formal  and requires no  explanation.     6.  Before passing to the first  appendix  (military proposals)  there  is oneapparent omission from the principal  memorandum to which I would call attention.It contains  no provision on the subject of commercial relations between this countryand Iraq.  This omission is intentional.  It was considered that the most convenientmethod of regulating questions of commerce between the two countries, and one leastlikely to  excite in foreign  circles  suspicion that His Majesty&apos;s Government were seeking to secure a privileged position for British trade in Iraq, would be to concludewith the  Iraq Government a separate  agreement on the lines of the commercial treaties existing between  this country  and the majority of  other foreign  States.This would, inter alia, provide  for the reciprocal  grant of  most-favoured-nation treatment.   A copy of the Model Treaty is enclosed for your  information and guidance.*First Appendix: Clause A.     7.  You will  see that His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to retain British forces(actually, in each  case,  Air Force units  with protective ground troops) at or in the&quot;vicinity of  Mosul, Hinaidi and Basra.  (The  object of the words  &quot; in the vicinity of,&quot; and of the mention of Basra rather than Shuaiba, is to provide for  the retentionin their present locations of the land aerodrome at Shuaiba and the seaplane station at  Basra.)  The Air Staff  attach  the greatest importance to the retention of AirForce units at each of these three stations, and you should, therefore, use your utmostendeavours to persuade the Iraq Government to accept such an arrangement. The third paragraph of this clause is  intended to secure, without undue emphasis, theretention by the British Forces remaining in Iraq of the judicial and fiscal privilegeswhich they  at present enjoy under Articles 10  and 11  of the Military Agreement of 1924 and under Articles 14 and 15 of the  Financial Agreement. I understand that the Air Ministry have not yet had time to examine fully whether this  paragraphadequately  covers the requirements of  the garrison, and I will  communicate with youfurther on  the subject as soon as possible.Clause B.     The  first paragraph is based upon Article  13 of the Military Agreement of 1924. The words  &apos;&apos; of all arms &apos;&apos; have been inserted  in order to ensure without possibility of doubt that the provision applies to His Majesty&apos;s Naval as well as Military Forces. In this connection  I would invite reference to Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s Confidential despatch of the 2nd September on the subject  of facilities for the free movement of His Majesty&apos;s ships in the ports and  waterways of Iraq.* Not printed.
 Clause  C.     This closely follows Article 2 of the Military Agreement of 1924. Clause  D.     This is based upon the Egyptian proposals (paragraph (2) of the British Note on the subject of the Army).  The question of the strength and composition of the British Military Mission mentioned in this clause is clearly a matter  for discussion with the Iraq Government.  Although His Majesty&apos;8 Government have ho desire to interfere unduly  with the  Iraq  Governments discretion in the matter of the corn- position of this  mission,  they  wish  you to direct your efforts to securing the acceptance by the Iraq. Government of a British Military Mission  of a strength sufficient to exert a real and enduring  influence within the Iraq Army.     8.   In  paragraph  3 of this  despatch it is  pointed  out  that  His Majesty&apos;s Government do not propose in their settlement with Iraq to enter into any vicarious engagements to protect the interests of  other foreign Powers  or their nationals. This does not mean, however, that the League of Nations  will be content to admit Iraq to membership  without ensuring that the interests of other States members of the  League are adequately safeguarded.  On  certain points undertakings will undoubtedly be demanded,  and  will have to  be  given  before Iraq is admitted to membership; but  these undertakings will not, as hitherto, be entered into by His Majesty&apos;s Government on behalf of Iraq; they wall be obligations which Iraq will have to assume on her own behalf, and at first hand. Much consideration has been given to the question of what assurances, apart from those expressly mentioned in the second paragraph of Article  1 of the Covenant, Iraq may reasonably be expected to give, and in the light of past applications for admission  to the League and of the advice which  His Majesty&apos;s Government have received as to League practice, a memorandum, a copy of which is enclosed for your  information and  guidance, has been prepared setting  out  such assurances, as,  in  the  opinion  of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Iraq Government would be well advised to give, if invited to do so. A copy of this memorandum should be communicated to the Iraq Government with the necessary explanations at some suitable stage of the negotiations.     9.   I am  advised that  when applications  for admission to membership of the League are received they are  referred  to a  Committee  of the  Assembly.  This Committee then proceeds  to examine the  question whether  the applicant State satisfies the conditions prescribed in paragraph 2 of Article 1  of the Covenant, and to invite the representative of  that State to furnish  further information  or give specific assurances upon such points as the  Committee deems necessary.  When its investigations are  completed the Committee reports to the  Assembly of the League, who then put the question to the vote.  I understand that if the Committee&apos;s report is favourable, there is little or no likelihood of the application  being rejected by the Assembly.  It is  thus of the utmost importance that the  Iraq Government, when applying for  admission to the  League,  should  be in a  position to furnish the Committee  with   such  information  and such  assurances  as will  ensure that the  Committee&apos;s report is favourable.  It is not suggested that the assurances set out  in the accompanying memorandum  should necessarily be volunteered by the Iraq Government;  merely that their representative at Geneva should be armed with authority to give such assurances should the necessity arise.   It should also be noted that the list of assurances in the memorandum is not necessarily exhaustive, and that Iraq might be asked  to add others.     10.  I. will now examine the  assurances paragraph by paragraph :      Paragraph 1  calls  for  little comment.  It follows closely the wording  of the assurance given by  the Abyssinian  Government  when making application for admission. Paragraph 2.     With regard  to the first part of this  assurance, I should  explain  that HisMajesty&apos;s Government have given consideration  to the question whether the IraqGovernment could reasonably be expected to undertake in advance to accede to all orany of the international conventions and agreements  referred to in Articles 6 and 7of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty  of 1927.  A certain number  of those conventions have      [20576]           &quot;                                             c 2
already been acceded to either  by or on behalf of Iraq, and in the case of theremaining conventions there seemed to His Majesty&apos;s Government little justification for requiring Iraq to forgo the discretionary right which she should enjoy in common with  other  free nations  of  deciding  in which of  the various  international agreements, &amp;c, negotiated under the auspices of the League she should participate.    The Arms Traffic Convention, however, stands in a somewhat  different category.Article 1 of the Covenant contemplates the imposition of regulations in regard tothe armaments of a State applying for membership.   In the case of Abyssinia an assurance somewhat similar to that now suggested in the case of Iraq was demandedand obtained.  Iraq, like Abyssinia,  is a  territory originally  situated within oneof the &quot; special zones &apos;&apos;  prescribed by the Arms Traffic Convention, and  it seemsalmost inevitable that the Iraq Government will have to enter into an engagement to accede to this Convention so soon as it becomes operative, and,  at the same time, toassume the undertakings contemplated in Article 28 of the Convention.  As you are aware, the Iraq Government in 1925 agreed to adhere to this Convention on its entry into force, and it is  therefore  unlikely that they will take exception to the assurancenow proposed.    The second part of this assurance also  needs explanation.  It was thoughtprobable that the League might seek to continue in some form the non-discriminatoryprovisions of Article 11 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922, and  might attempt toobtain from the Iraq Government an assurance in  terms similar  to those employedin that Article.   The effect of this would be to limit to some extent the freedom ofaction of the Iraq Government in negotiating future commercial  agreements and in developing the natural resources of  the country.   It has been  suggested to HisMajesty&apos;s Government that, if the Iraq Government were to undertake to accede tothe Convention relating to the treatment of foreigners which has recently been underdiscussion at Paris, members of the League would  find it very  difficult to justify ademand for any further assurances.  If that  Convention,  when  it is concluded&apos; isgenerally accepted  as  providing adequate protection  for  foreign nationals in allother States of the  League, it clearly  would be both unreasonable and derogatory to regard it as inadequate in the case of Iraq.  A preliminary draft of the convention is enclosed for your information and that of the Iraq Government.Paragraph 3.    Something on the lines of this assurance will almost certainly be  required from iraq  and, as the Iraq Government presumably  have no intention of repudiatinginternational engagements regularly assumed,  they are unlikely to take exception tothis paragraph.Paragraph 4.  - Various organs of the League of Nations  have shown themselves  extremelysolicitous of the welfare of racial and religious minorities in the Near and middle east, and in their report to the Council on the  Iraq Report for 1928 the permanent mandates Commission suggested that, as a condition precedent to the admission ofIraq  to the League, adequate safeguards on  the  subject of minorities  should beobtained.   The Iraq Government  will  almost certainly  be required  to give an assurance in terms similar to that suggested in  the memorandum.Paragraph 5.    The new judicial  system which  it is proposed to introduce in Iraq on theabolition of the  Judicial Agreement  of  1924 is unlikely to enter into force untilshortly before the date proposed for the admission of Iraq. There will thus not be  asufficient interval to enable foreign States to satisfy themselves that the new system has been established on a satisfactory and enduring basis.  It seems certain that theLeague will require an assurance  from Iraq  that the system will be retained inforce for a sufficient period (say, 10 or 15 years) to ensure that  the administrationof justice in Iraq is likely to be maintained at a satisfactory level of efficiency.     11. It  is not  the wish  of His Majesty&apos;s  Government unduly to  limit  yourdiscretion in the matter of the wording of the proposed new treaty and  subsidiaryinstruments.  The,  accompanying proposals are intended in the main to be for yourinformation and guidance.   It is  quite  possible that  in the  give and  take of
                                      1-3negotiation you will find alternative wording which would be more acceptable to theIraq Government and would equally, well safeguard the interests of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.  It has often been found in the past that a comparatively unimportantalteration of wording or a  slight rearrangement of  ideas has  been sufficient  to overcome strongly pressed objections on the part of the Iraq Government.  It is not improbable that similar circumstances will  arise in  your forthcoming negotiationscapable of being handled in the same fashion.  The new Treaty will, however, come under close and most critical scrutiny at Geneva and elsewhere;  consequently, the wording palls for a greater degree of caution and assumes a greater importance than would  normally be  the  case.   It  would be well,  therefore,  that before  definitelyaccepting any important departure from the terms of the accompanying  proposalsyou should report to London for the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s  Government.    12.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are quite  content to leave the question of thebest method of  negotiating the proposed new Treaty to your unfettered discretionThey are, however, much impressed by the view taken in Major Young&apos;s  Secretdespatch of  the 14th  of October as to the desirability of arranging that the IraqGovernment should themselves take the initiative in making proposals.  There are obvious advantages in this  method.   It is possible that  by  this means  the IraqGovernment might, as Major Young apparently contemplates, be induced to offerspontaneously concessions which,  if  first asked for by His Majesty&apos;s Government,might only be drawn from them with great difficulty and in return for compensatingadvantages.   It would, moreover, go some way to  meet the  criticism, frequentlyventilated in the local Parliament and in the vernacular press, that hitherto the part played by the Iraq Government in the negotiation of treaties with this country hasbeen negligible, and that the treaties have in practice been imposed ready-made onIraq by His Majesty&apos;s Government.    13.  His Majesty&apos;s Government doubt,  however, the advisability of proceeding in quite so formal a manner  as is suggested in the last paragraph  of Major Young&apos;despatch. They are apprehensive  lest a formal request to the Iraq Government  tostate their desiderata might draw  forth a document  the effect  of which would be  to commit that Government too definitely to certain proposals at an early stage of thenegotiations, a document, moreover, which might subsequently acquire something of the character of a &quot; National Pact.&quot;  His Majesty&apos;s Government are inclined  tothink that it might be wiser to proceed in the first instance more informally, and  todraw from the Iraqi representatives in the course of preliminary conversations somerough indication of the provisions which they would wish to see included in the new treaty, and, while not disclosing the British proposals in the early stages, to bringthose proposals forward piecemeal  in the  course of  negotiation.  While  I have thought it well to mention this doubt and this suggestion, I wish  to emphasise thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government have no wish whatever to interfere with your discretionat any stage in regard to the conduct  of the negotiations.  You alone are in aposition  to  judge both  the opportunity and the method of approach,  and  HisMajesty&apos;s Government have the fullest confidence in your judgment.ANNEXURE 2.            Memorandum of Proposals for an Anglo-Iraq Settlement.Proposal 1.    There  shall be perpetual peace and friendship between His Britannic majesty and His Majesty the King of Iraq.    There shall be established between the High Contracting Parties a close alliancein consecration of  their friendship,  their cordial understanding  and their  good relations.Proposal 2.    Each High Contracting Party will be  represented at the Court  of  the other high  Contracting Party by an Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary,duly accredited.
Proposal 3.     There shall be full and frank consultation between the High Contracting Parties:in all matters  of Foreign Policy  which may affect their common interests.  Eachof the High Contracting Parties undertakes not to adopt in foreign countries an attitude which is inconsistent with the  alliance or might create difficulties for theother party thereto.  In pursuance of this undertaking, they will not oppose eachother &apos;s policy in  foreign countries, nor conclude with a third Power any agreementof a political character which might be prejudicial to the  interests of the other party.,Proposal 4.     Should any dispute with a third State produce a situation which involves therisk of a rupture  with that State, the High Contracting Parties will concert togetherwith a view to the settlement of the said  dispute by peaceful means in accordancewith the provisions of  the  Covenant  of the League of  Nations, and of any other-international obligations which may be applicable to the case.Proposal 5.     If, notwithstanding  the provisions of proposal  4  above,  either of the HighContracting Parties become engaged in war, the other High Contracting Party will,subject always  to the provisions of  proposal 10 below, immediately come to his aidin the capacity of  an ally.   In particular, His Majesty the  King of Iraq will, inthe event of war or menace of  war, furnish to His Britannic Majesty  on  Iraqterritory all the facilities and assistance  in his power, including the use of his ports,aerodromes and means of communication.Proposal 6.     In view of the desirability of  identity in training and methods  between the iraqi and British armies, His Majesty the King of Iraq undertakes that, should hedeem it necessary to have  recourse to foreign military instructors,  these  shall be chosen from amongst British subjects.  He further undertakes that any personnel of his forces that may be sent abroad for military training will be sent to  trainingcentres in  the  territories of His Britannic Majesty,  and that the Armament  andequipment of his forces shall not differ in  type from those of the forces of  HisBritannic Majesty.Proposal 7.     In  order to  secure  to  His  Britannic Majesty the  protection of essential air communications and of  his interests in the Persian Gulf,  and  to facilitate thedischarge of the mutual obligations of  the  High Contracting Parties under pro-posal 5 above, His  Majesty the King  of Iraq authorises His Britannic Majesty tomaintain upon Iraq territory, under the conditions specified  in the first Appendixannexed hereto, such forces as His Britannic Majesty considers necessary for those purposes,  provided that rio major changes in the strength of those forces shall bemade at any time without previous consultation with His Majesty the King of Iraq.Proposal 8.     In view of the close friendship  and alliance  between the High  ContractingParties and of  the similarity of administrative methods employed in their respectiveterritories, His Majesty the King of  Iraq will normally engage British subjects when in need of the  services of foreign officials.  Such officials will be selected by agree-ment between the High Contracting  Parties.     Nothing in these proposals shall, however, affect the validity of the contractsconcluded and in existence between the Iraq Government and British  officials, whichshall be maintained.Proposal 9.     The financial relations between  the High.Contracting Parties shall be regulatedin accordance with  the provisions of the  second Appendix annexed hereto.
Proposal 10.    Nothing in the present proposals is intended to or shall in any way prejudice the rights and obligations which devolve, or may devolve, upon either of the HighContracting Parties under the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Treaty forthe Renunciation of War signed at Paris on the 27th day of August, 1928.Proposal 11.    Should any difference arise relative to the application or the  interpretation ofthe provisions  of the  treaty to be based on the present proposals, and should theHigh Contracting Parties fail to settle such difference by direct negotiation, then itshall be dealt with in  accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the Leagueof Nations.Proposal 12.    The two Appendices annexed hereto shall be regarded as an integral part of thepresent proposals.Proposal 13.    The Treaty to be based upon these  proposals shall be ratified,  and ratificationsshall be exchanged as  soon as possible.  Thereafter it shall come into force as soon asIraq has been admitted to membership of the League of Nations.    At any time after the expiration of a period of twenty-five years from the cominginto force of the Treaty such modification of its terms as may be deemed appropriate in the circumstances as they then exist may be made by agreement between the HighContracting Parties.Proposal 14.    The Treaty  to be based  upon these proposals shall  replace  the  Treaties of alliance signed at Baghdad on  the 10th day of October, 1922, corresponding withthe 19th day  of SaTar,  1341,  Hijrah,  and on the  13th day  of  January,  1926,corresponding  with the 28th day  of Jamadi-al-Ukhra, 1344, Hijrah,  which  shall cease to have effect upon the entry into force of this Treaty.   It shall be executed in duplicate, in  the English and  Arabic languages, of  which the  former  shall beregarded as the authoritative version.

(Will be  prepared later if necessary.)ANNEXURE 3.Memorandum of Assurances which the  Iraq Government would be well advised  to-    be prepared to give in  connection with their application for  the admission of    Iraq to the League of Nations, if invited to do so.    1.  Iraq declares herself ready to accept the conditions laid down in Article 1of the Covenant, and to carry out both now and hereafter all obligations incumbentupon Members of the League of Nations under that Instrument.    2.
