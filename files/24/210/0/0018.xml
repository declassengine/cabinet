102HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).P.  68(30),Copy No.3^CABINET. Government of India&apos;s Cotton Tariff Proposals.    Question of publication of correspondence.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.        I have just received an urgent telegram fromthe Viceroy to the effect that, after considering the probability that there will be a. demand for the publicationof telegrams exchanged between the Cabinet and the Governmentof India on the Cotton Tariff proposals,  he thinks it willne best to put the cards on the table at  once and for theFinance Member (Sir George Schuster)  to read the telegramsin the course of his Budget speech.    This speech willbe delivered on Friday next,  the 28th February, at 5 P-n.which is equivalent to noon G.M.T.        The telegrams proposed to be  read out are shown below.   The first is the telegram sent after theCabinet meeting of 7th February (See  Cabinet Oonclusio&apos;hs9(30) 7th February No.2 and Appendix;  the second is anedited version of the Viceroy&apos;s private and personal telegram which was circulated in CP. 49(30);   thethird is the message which I  sent after the Cabinet meetingof 19th February (see Cabinet Conclusions 11(30)19th February No.4).        If no objection is 33on,   I propose to give theViceroy discretion to act as  he proposes.                                 \7.3.25th February 1930.
Telee-ram from Secretary of State to Viceroy,    -  Dated 7th February 1930.        Y/iuh reference to the proposed increase of theIndian c otton duties, theCabinet, at a special meetingheld this morning, resolved that it would not boinconsistent with the procedure governing the now wellrecognised Fiscal Autonomy Convention to make, at thisstage, the following representations to the  Government ofIndia.        First, the probability that such an additionalduty would be likely to raise the pi ice of goods in Indiaitself to the great detriment of the poorer classesgenerally in that country;   and secondly, the probability that such an additional duty would have a. disaterous efect in England at this moment - an effect  which theCabinet feels sure that you and your Legislature do not desire bo create.        From both points of view the  Cabinet views withthe gravest apprehension the proposed additional duty and trusts that full weight will be given to  the aboveconsiderations.                      .....oOo-------                         II.      Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State,              Dated 24th February 1930.        Official. Reference to your telegram  of the 8thFebruary 480.  I have discussed Cabinet representationwith my Council, and we are deeply impressed  by a message of this nature.  Nevertheless, we feel bound to adhere to our main uroposals.
         It  must  be  remembered, firstly, that we want revenue; secondly, that  customsis  our  chief  source;  thirdly, that general  revenue  tariff  stands at 15 per  cent, while duty on cotton piece  goods is  only 11 per cent.;  fourthly, that  Indian industry is suffering from deep depression, and that  as  regards  Bombay, the mills are approaching a desperate position which may  affect the whole future of this important centre of Indian commerce and finance.  Moreover,  in a year  like present when we have to impose heavy new taxation, wo could  not for revenue  purposes leave cotton duties alone.         As  regards  raising of cost  to consumer, we believe in those goods where external competition is chiefly felt, namely plain grey shirtings and light sheetings and cheaper coloured goods,  internal  competition will be weapon to keep prices down.     As  regards bleached goods and finer quality  grey and coloured goods, which Lancashire mainly supplies, a 4- per cent,  increase in price cannot bo represented as a crushing burden.         As  regards  second point in Cabinet decision -  the danger to British interests - we recognise that possible decline  in  consumption of Lancashire goods may be a serious matter,  but we  are clearly bound to put India &apos;s interests first.    7c  also recognise how important it is to India not  to antagonise British opinion,  and quite apart from  this-,  we  are  of course concerned at  this time to avoid unnecessary injury to British interests.    V/e  have carefully considered what  we  could do  in this respect,  and while we  cannot modify general application of 15 percent,  revenue duty,  we are prepared  to  propose  to  Assembly that,  as  regards any additional  and  temporary protective                                                  measures,
measures, their application might be limited to non-british goods 5 and that in these circumstances there should, be imposed, in addition t o 15 per cent, revenue duty,  a 5 percent, protective duty with a minimum of 3k annas perooUnd oh &quot;olain grey soods against all cotton niece  soodsfrom outside the United Kingdom.   We should proposeprotective duty for three years only, and undertake to have its effects examined by Tariff Board before end of  thisperiod.  Wo think it unlikely having regard to immensepreponderance of British imports  in classes of bleaehedgoods, of bordered grey goods and finer coloured goods,that additional duty would have any appreciable effect on prices.        In placing our proposals before the Assembly weshall point out that, so far as we are aware,  this  is thefirst occasion on which considered opinion of the cabinet has been conveyed in this form to the Government of India,and we are impressed with significance of the precedentso established.  We cannot ask the Assembly to commit themselves to Imperial Preference as a principle, but merely tc adopt a particular course which in our judgmentis consistent with India&apos;s interests at a critical  juncturewhen much may depend on Indian response to BritishGovernment&apos;s appeal.   We shall have to make it plain toAssembly that, while thero aro grounds for treating plaingrey goods exceptionally,  we could not in any circumstancesagree at present stage, and for emergency purpose whichwe have in view, to an additional protective duty of                                                    five
five per cent, on all classes of piece goods irrespective of the country of origin, since immediate benefit to indian producer would be wholly incommensurate with burdenimposed on Indian consumer.   We desire als-o to make  *it clear that in a matter of this kind after franklystating our case we should desire to elicit the most free expression of opinion from the Legislature with whom f inaldecision must rest.                   -------oOo------                        III.       Telee-ram from Secretary of State  to Viceroy,              Dated 19th February 1930.        The Cabinet has received your telegram andrecognising the position of India under the TariffAutonomy Convention is precluded from offering anyfurther comments on your proposals.                    ...----0Qo-------
