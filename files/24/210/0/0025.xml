As it is doubtful whether In present circumstancespayment of the  20,000 compensation can be justified, wouldyou let me know; as soon as possible whether you think that,in event of Charitonenko House scheme not maturing,requirements of yourself and Embassy would be met with reasonable comfort and dignity if present arrangements werereadjusted on following lines or any alternative thatyou can suggest:     That you should reside in present house with HonoraryAttache and one secretary, also keeping Chancery and office for Commercial Secretariat there:     That Counsellor, and remaining secretary, 2 CommercialSecretaries and Vice Consul should continue to live in hotel,and that clerical staff should live in hotel accommodation which  could presumably be obtained at less expensive rate than for diplomatic staff, and for which we should pay.-1-
     Decypher telegram from Sir E. Ovey ITo,  101 of March                  ......  ra&quot;t&quot;,&quot;&quot;l950TPERSONAL.     Following for Sir II,,  Montgomery:-     Your telegram Ho. 82 (of February 28th).     Your suggestion is not practicable if Moscow postis to be regarded as one of Embass3r status.     Present house which is of legation size would be suitable for Ambassador&apos;s residence along if quarters for Chancery and staff could be found at convenientdistance o    There are no such quarters available anywhere.Idea that Ambassador can live in the present house sharingfirst floor with Secretary and abandoning all ground floorexcept dining room to Chancery, Commercial Secretary, andthe heterogeneous crowd who come here on business or introuble to an Embassy Chancery would.be most undignified,inconvenient and uncomfortable.   It would be like theHodgson regime only worse for we have now a- larger staff.It would be most embarrassing for me to entertain mydiplomatic colleagues or Soviet officials (nearly all of whom have entertained me already on a sumptuous scale) insuch a ramshackle establishment.     It would also involve a serious political mistake.Soviet government wish our Embassy to be permanent here andCharitonenko House, one of the best in Moscow, is indicated as and very generally believed to be our futureEmbassj&apos;.   -Definitely to reject it and to limit ourselves to what can only be interpreted as temporal accommodation would be understood to mean that our presence here isephemeral and this would react unfavourably on my dealings
With Soviet government and on relations between the twocountries.   Nor would proposal be an economy..Hotel accommodation is expensive and very limited.To keep diplomatic and Chancery staff in any hotelthat is net positively unclean would I calculateactually cost more than any saving on hotel billsof myself, my attendants, and one secretary.
