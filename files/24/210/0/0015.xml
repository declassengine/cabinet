Copy  No.   41CP.  65  (30).REVISE.                                 CABINET.COMMITTEE ON  POLICY IN EAST  AFRICA                                  REPORT.    1.   AT their Meeting on the 17th December, 1929 (Cabinet 53 (29), Conclusion 2),the Cabinet agreed     That a Cabinet Committee, composed of             The Lord Chancellor (in the Chair),            The Secretary of State for the Colonies,            The Secretary of State for India,            The Secretary of State for Air,        should examine the documents circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of        State for the Colonies and advise the Cabinet as to the policy they should        adopt, directing their attention  more  particularly  to  the two following        points:          (i.) Whether  there should be a new officer appointed,  whose duties would               be to supervise Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda (a Governor-General               or a High Commissioner), and what  should  be his functions and               powers in relation  to the three Governments,  which among them               exercise jurisdiction over that area.        (ii.) Assuming such an officer be appointed, what alteration, if any, should               be made in the composition of the Kenya Legislative Council.    2.   We have adopted as the basis of our Report the Devonshire Declaration of1922, as follows        &quot; Primarily,  Kenya is an African territory,  and  His  Majesty&apos;s  Govern-    ment   think  it  necessary  definitely   to   record  their  considered  opinion    that   the  interests of  the  African  natives   must  be  paramount,  and    that if,  and   when, those interests  and  the interests  of the  immigrant    races  should conflict, the  former should  prevail.   Obviously,  the interests    of  the  other  communities, European,   Indian or  Arab,   must  severally  be    safeguarded.   Whatever  the  circumstances in which  members of  these com-    munities have entered Kenya, there will be no drastic  action or reversal  of    measures  already  introduced,  such as may have  been contemplated in some    quarters, the result of which might be to destroy or impair the existing interests    of those who have already settled in Kenya.  But in the administration of    Kenya His Majesty&apos;s Government regard themselves as  exercising a trust on    behalf of  the African population, and they are unable to  delegate or share this    trust, the  object of which may be defined as the protection and advancement of    the native races.   It is not necessary to attempt to elaborate this position; the    lines of development are as yet in certain  directions undetermined,  and many    difficult problems arise which  require time  for their solution.  But there can    be no room for doubt  that it is the mission of Great Britain to work continuously    for the training and education of the Africans towards  a higher intellectual,    moral and economic  level  than that which they had reached when  the  Crown       [20948]                                                        B
2     assumed the responsibility for the administration of this territory.  At present     special consideration is  being given to economic  development in the  native     reserves, and within the limits imposed by the finances of the Colony all that is     possible for  the advancement and development of the Africans, both inside and     outside the native reserves, will be done.&quot;     3.   As to (i) above, we  are all agreed that a High  Commissioner should be appointed to supervise Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda, and we are all-agreed that, if it were possible, the Council  to assist him in his duties should be of an  advisory character.  Unfortunately, however,  it is not possible to come to this determination^ by reason of the differences in  the form of government in the three territories.     4.   Uganda is a Protectorate, where we are more or less at liberty to  do as we like.     5.   Tanganyika is a Mandated Territory, which we haA^e to administer in terms of the Mandate.     6.   A small sea-coast strip  of Kenya is a Protectorate, but the larger part of the  territory is a Colony and subject to the provisions of  Section 3 of the British Settlements Act,  1887.     7.   We are advised that, as far as Kenya is concerned, it is not possible for us to recommend an Advisory Council as distinguished from a Legislative Council.  In these circumstances  we have had to agree upon a scheme for Closer Union in East Africa, which is  set  forth in the Appendix to this Report.   It will be observed that the  Council in this scheme is of a legislative character, but we hope that  the veto given to the High Commissioner under Section 1 (;&apos;) and (k) will meet the case.     8.   As to (ii). above, the suggested changes in the constitution of the Legislative Council of Kenya have been the subject of particular consideration.  The goal of con- stitutional evolution, in Kenya as elsewhere, is admittedly responsible government by a Ministry representing an electorate in which every section of  the population finds an effective and adequate voice.   But that goal cannot be reached at any early date in a community  where it has  so far been practicable to enfranchise less than 1 per cent, of the population, and where the idea of any substantial extension of the franchise finds little general support.  For the native African population, indeed, in so far as the tribal organisation is still the basis of its social organisation, the most promising line of development  for the near future may well lie, not in any direct participation in the Legislative Council, but in the increasing  importanceto be given to the Native Councils an importance  to be manifested alike in a continuous widening of their  functions, and in a constant communication  to  these Councils, through the  District  Commissioners  or otherwise,  of  the various pro- ceedings and proposals of the Executive Government, as well as the enactments or Bills of the Colony&apos;s Legislature.     9.   The  conclusion to which His Majesty&apos;s Government have come is, at this juncture, to leave the  constitution of the Kenya Legislative Council substantially unchanged and to retain the official majority. The eleven elected European members, the five  elected Indian  members, and the one elected Arab member, together  with the twenty  Official Members, should, for the present, remain unaltered.  All the  Council- lOrs, whatever their race, and  whether they are or are not Government officials, will,of course, be on an equal footing  as Members of the Council; and will, in particular,be entitled to a proportionate  share in the membership of any Committees that maybe set up.  His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that they are justified in assuming that all the members of the Council, official and unofficial,  will,  whatever their raceor position, discharge their duties as legislators with a view to the lasting advantageof the Colony as a whole, rather than as advocates of the temporary interests ofparticular sections.  At the  same time, the constitutional  right of the Governormust be preserved to require,  in  any  case in which  he may  deem  it necessary, thatall the official members should support his policy by their votes.  Moreover,  in orderto ensure a somewhat  fuller representation of the  interests and, as  far as may be practicable, the views  of that part of the population not specially voiced by theEuropean, the Indian  or  the  Arab, His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that thereshould  be  two (instead of one) members nominated by  the  Governor,  withoutrestriction of race, .to be  particularly charged with  defending the interests andvoicing  the feelings and opinions of the Africans and other unrepresented  persons
    10.  With regard to the  franchise for the Legislative Council of Kenya,  we agree that the establishment  of a common roll is  the object to be aimed  at andattained, with an equal franchise of a civilisation or education character open to allraces.  We have not, however,  sufficient evidence before us either from a political orgeographical standpoint  to say in what manner this desirable end can be reached.In these circumstances we recommend to  the Cabinet that  an  enquiry should beundertaken  by the  High Commissioner,  when  appointed,  as to what is the  mostpracticable action to be taken in this direction in the immediate future.    11.  We accordingly recommend  the Cabinet     (a) To give their approval in principle to the policy outlined in the Scheme  for           Closer Union  in East Africa set out in the Appendix hereto, and also to           the  policy  regarding the constitution  of  the  Legislative  Council  of           Kenya and  the Kenya franchise set out  in paragraphs  8-10 above.    (b) To authorise the  Secretary of State for the  Colonies (1) to  take steps with a           view to the appointment of a Joint Committee of both Houses to consider           the policy comprised in (a) above, and (2) to circulate to that Committee           as embodying  the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government  the Appendix to           this Report and paragraphs 8 and 9  and the substance of paragraph 10           above, together with a historical and explanatory memorandum, to be           settled by the  Secretary of  State for the Colonies in consultation with  the           Secretary of State  for India.    We also recommend the Cabinet to approve (subject to  the alterations necessaryto bring it into harmony with the decisions now reached) the Statement of native policy set out on pages 1  to 9 of the Note by the Secretary of State for the Colonies(CP. 360 (29)), and to authorise the presentation  to Parliament  of the Statementafter it has been duly  communicated  to the Governors of the Territories concerned for their information and guidance.
