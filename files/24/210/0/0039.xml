THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                                                           printed for the Cabinet&apos;  March 1930.         &apos;SECRET.                                                      Copy No.   3 6CP. (89) 30.                                 CABINET.    I CIRCULATE to the Cabinet a memorandum in regard to the instructions tobe given  to  our  delegates  attending   the  Conference on  the  Codification ofInternational Law in regard  to Territorial Waters.    It will be seen that decisions are required on two points :                 .    (1) Whether our delegates are to refuse to admit any claims to territorial waters          exceeding 3 miles,  even if this should result in the Conference failing to          come to any agreement as to the limit of  territorial waters for general          purposes;                                                         &apos;;-    (2) Whether our delegates should refuse to agree to the establishment by  the          Conference of a more extended limit of jurisdiction, up to 12 miles,  for          certain purposes, such as the prevention of liquor smuggling, and should          maintain  that the  proper course is the conclusion of bilateral agreements          on the subject where necessary.                                  ;  . /                                                                      A. H.    March 10,  1930.                                                     &apos;    Amongst the subjects to be discussed at the Conference on the Codification ofInternational Law which is to meet at The Hague  on the 13th  instant under the auspices of the League of Nations is that of territorial waters.    2.   This question formed the subject of a questionnaire issued by the Leagueto which His Majesty &apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and  a number of otherGovernments sent replies.  These replies were considered by a Committee of :Expertsappointed by the League, who formulated bases of discussion, and these bases werein turn considered by an Inter-Departmental Committee here.                -;;    Although there was substantial agreement in that Committee as to the principles to be aimed at,  there was considerable difference as to  the length to which it wouldbe  expedient for the United Kingdom Delegates to  go in insisting on the british point  of view with regard to  certain matters,  and as to the extent to which.theyshould be  prepared to make sacrifices with regard  to those matters with the,,soleobject of obtaining an agreement.  The principal  outstanding  questions; are thefollowing :  (1) The extent of territorial waters, and  (2) the recognition of a specialadministrative zone outside  territorial waters for certain purposes, more especially the prevention of smuggling.                                            :    3.  With regard  to (1), the Inter-Departmental  Committee  reported in favourof  the maintenance of the traditional limit of  3* miles, but, apart  from the repre-sentatives  of the Admiralty  and the Board of Trade, they were of opinion that theclaim  of Norway and Sweden  to a limit of 4 miles might possibly be supported O-nhistorical grounds, but only on the understanding that this should be  regarded asa special and exceptional case and subject to the clear acceptance of the 3-mile limitgenerally by all other countries.   The Admiralty, Board of Trade- and  Ministry ofAgriculture and Fisheries, which are the Departments directly concerned in securingthe greatest possible freedom  from restriction or interference ;fOr British&apos;-ships5 ofall descriptions, consider, however/ that&apos; other&apos;countries&apos; claiming fhore: than 3 miles      5301   [20759]
 such as France, Italy, Russia,; Spain and: Portugal, would not agree to specialconcessions being made to Norway and Sweden unless their  own claims were alsomet; and that the mere suggestion of an  extended limit to Norway and Sweden would weaken the case for  the 3-mile limit and open the door to claims which would havea serious effect on British maritime  interests all over the  world.   The Admiraltystrongly object to any exception being made, and the Board of Trade and Ministryof Agriculture and Fisheries take the view that it would be better to have no agree-ment at all on the point than to make any exception.     In  these  circumstances a  decision is required whether  the  United kingdom delegates are  to refuse to admit any claims exceeding 3 miles, even if this should result in the Conference failing to come to any agreement at all on this particularpoint.     4. (2)  The  Committee of Experts proposed  as  a  basis of  discussion the recognition  of a limit of  12 miles for certain specified purposes,  such as therepression  of  smuggling  and  sanitary control.   The  Three  Departments (theAdmiralty, Board of Trade and Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries) apprehendthat, were this agreed to, claims would soon arise for the extension of the applicationof this limit to neutrality, fishery and other matters.  Apart  from the views of theAdmiralty, who are strongly against the adoption of this  further limit as  they are anxious to keep the  limits of the jurisdiction of other nations over the seas to theminimum, the Board of Trade anticipate considerable interference with merchantshipping if such an extension were agreed to, while the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries contemplate with the greatest anxiety the  injury to the British  trawlingindustry which might result.  The Board of Trade and Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries consider that it would be better to have no agreement at all on this pointalso than to accept any general principle involving an extended right of jurisdiction.     No difficulty has arisen in recent times on this question except in the case ofthose countries which have  adopted  Prohibition  and are concerned with theprevention of liquor smuggling. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom have endeavoured to meet the United States upon it by concluding with them theAnglo-American Liquor Agreement.  Finland has a similar difficulty, and we havestated that, if she can show that British ships are concerned in liquor smuggling, weshould be quite ready to conclude an agreement  with her.  It is doubtful whether there is sufficient case for any general recognition of such an extension of jurisdictionas is oroposed.  There would, of course,  be no  objection  to the United  kingdom delegates agreeing to the insertion in the Convention drawn up by the Conference ofa provision recommending that, in cases where it is  established that local considera-tions render  such  a  course  necessary, an extension of  jurisdiction for specialpurposes, such as the prevention of liquor smuggling, should  be provided for by theconclusion of bilateral agreements  between the parties.   A decision is  requiredwhether the  delegates should decline to go beyond  the alternative outlined in thepreceding sentence,  even though this part of the labours of  the Conference should result in failure to reach any agreement.     5.   With regard to the  general  question  of  the advisability of acceptingdecisions which find a large body of support at the Conference, notwithstanding thefact that they are unfavourable to the  interests of this country, it is observed thatthe only object in so doing is to secure the adoption as international law of principlesmore favourable  than  might  be expected  to  emerge from judgments  of thePermanent Court of International Justice at The Hague when called upon to declarewhat International Law on a particular subject may be.-With regard to  maritime questions,  the Conference may be  regarded  as  a particularly unfavourable  forum,  as  many  States  having  little or  no  maritimeinterests will be represented and will have voting power which would not be repre-sented  on the International Court  to the same extent.  It  is the view of theAdmiralty, Board of Trade and Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries that it wouldbe safer in regard to matters of primary importance to this  country to leave disputesto be settled by the International Court, to whom the British  view of  the law mightwell commend itself, rather than to accept a general convention of an unsatisfactorycharacter.     The Admiralty, Board of Trade  and Ministry of Agriculture  and  Fisheriesbeing  the  Departments more closely concerned  with  these questions,  specialprominence has been given to their views.  I should, however, add that their viewsfindI ascertain measure,of supportdn other^Departments,
