COPY NO. 3                        CABINET                                                            t                     WHEAT AND FLOUR.       Memorandum sent to the Prime Minister by one of        the most Important&quot; grain &quot;Importers&quot;&quot;In the countryL                   THE PLAN IN OUTLINE.     a.     Parliament is to authorise the Government to enter     Into an arrangement whereby the purchase of wheat and     flour and the milling of flour are to be carried on by a     Company that is to enjoy a monopoly of  this trade.     b.     A valuation Is to be made of the physical properties     of the flour mills, including not only the plants but all     auxiliary properties necessary to the working of these     businesses.  This valuation to be determined by a mixed     Board, equally composed of representatives of the Government     and of the Millers.  The Chairman to be nominated by the     Government.     c.     Accountants are to audit the files of the flour     millers for the past five years, both as to income and     equity.  The valuation of these assets to be estimated upon                                                                 &quot; h     their physical worth and their proved earning capacity,     based on a five year record.  This should ensure that no     obsolete and useless property will be assumed Toy the     Corporation.secret&amp;T.P.88 (30 ) -
                                                            9                                                            Od.     The Company is to have an absolute monopoly to the importation of wheat and flour,  and the milling andselling of flour.  The Company is to issue debenturespound for pound up to the amount of the valuation of theproperties,.  These debentures are to be issued as   ,compensation for the acquisition of the milling propertiesand assets.       The rate of interest and the maturity of thesedebenture? are to be determined by the Treasury.       The Ordinary share capital of the Company is to be divided, as follows :-       51% in perpetuity t,o H.M. Government, and theremainder to be divided between the Flour Millers and the grain trade.  The proportions to be determined later by ajoint Committee of the Government, the flour millers andthe grain trade.  The shares are to be paid for and theappropriate instalments of payment arranged as will thenseem fitting.je..     The Board of Directors is to be nominated as to 50%by the Government, plus the Chairman, who is to have thecasting vote.  The Government is to appoint Directors from among recognised agricultural interests, trade unions,co-operatives and other consumers councils.  The othershareholders are to elect their own Directors at a  GeneralMeeting according to the ordinary routine of limited liability Companies .
jL 6f.     The management of the Company is to be conducted by its Directors and officers on an ordinary commercial basis,and is not to function in the manner of a GovernmentDepartment.  For all practical purposes, the Company is toact as an ordinary although gigantic and monopolistic   &apos;trade concern.  The Monopoly shall buy its wheat require-ments on a competitive basis direct from responsiblesources, whether these be co-operative or privateenterprises.g.     After the payment of the debenture interest, theCompany shall pay a fair1 rate of dividend on the ordinal1:/shares, after allowing for such reserves as is necessaryin a business, which, in the nature of the case, does not require a large proportion of working capital to turnover.h.     A reserve fund to be established towards the stabilisation of British wheat, the outlines- of which are discussed in the attached memorandum on the plan.i.   The Government should have the right to redeem thedebentures at par after a period of years; such period to bedetermined by the Treasury, or by further sanction ofParliament.jc     The Government to retain the right to acquire bypurcha.se, after a period of time, the 49 % Ordinary sharesat a valuation to be determined by a mixed Commission.
AMPLIFICATION  OP  PLAIT.1.     Though avoiding nationalisation,  this plan securesGovernmental control.2.     With the exception of the subscription by theGovernment for the 5!fa of tho Ordinary (and nominal)capital, this plan requires no special Treasury financing.3.     The debentures, although not guaranteed by theTreasury, would enjoy the high prestige of a charteredand monopolistic Company, in which H.I.  Government have a,controlling interest.4.     The ordinary share capital need not be-large, nor-fully paid up.  The nature of the business would make it possible for such a Corporation to finance its turnoverby acceptances.5.     The Corporation, though providing fair compensation,is only paying basis proven earning capacity.6.     hot only does this plan provide reasonablecompensation, but in offering the millers an interest atpar in a State monopoly, the plan insures the loyalco-operation of the best elements amongst the millers.In offering similar participation to the grain trade, itinvites the support of this trading body.These individual financial commitments create a materialinterest in the success of the Corporation among the tx&apos;adeat large.
7.     The consolidated position of the Milling industrylends itself to further unification.0.     The revolution in grain marketing has inflictedsuch injury on the grain community that, they will giveready support to such a constructive plan.9.     During the war, the Government subsidised the grain trade by a method which in effect was a cashdistribution on the basis of pre-war turnover.This present plan avoids any such costly procedure.10.    This State monopoly will buy their requirements from any responsible body of private traders, farmboards, pools or co-operatives, on a competitive basis and at net prices.11.    This policy will give a new lease of life to  the few independent wheat distributors at p^-resent facedwith elimination by Pools, Boards, Trusts and Combines.It will help to restore free competition in the world&apos;swheat markets.12.    A permanent buying Institution of this kind isa calculable factor which will enable London to regainits premier position  in the world1s wheat market.Commitments with such a stabilised buyer as thisCorporation will directly facilitate British merchantsrecapturing the Continental trade,13.    At the moment, Great Britain possesses the talent                                                   wi th
the necessary -technical knowledge to direct thisbusiness efficiently.   At the present rate oferosion, this might not be the ease at a later date.  This plan, in keeping the trade in being,retains a school of experience from which talentcan be drawn when required.          .           t14.    This plan provides for a reversal of policy should subsequent events make a return to privatetrading desirable without any undue complications.15.    The revival of competitive activities in grainbuying will be a great help to British shipping,at present suffering from disastrous freight rates.British merchant shipping should naturally benefit by the revived activities of the British grainShippers, and the preference extended to Britishbottoms carrying monopoly grain.16.    With the co-operation of -the Food Council,this State Monopoly will have direct control overthe Baking end distributing trade, assuring theconsumer a reasonable price and satisfactoryquality.17.    This Corporation will acquire home grown wheat based on quality eit a sliding scale, to bedetermined as follows : -In years of world large crops, it will allow aneconomic price to the British grower, without reference to the prevailing depressed world priceof wheat.In years of world short crops, the British farmerwill receive a fair and economic price, but notat the undue expense of the consumer.
                                                   9 i P                                               - ...   I QThis sliding scale system obviates the necessity of having a fixed price for wheat which might givesatisfaction neither to the producer nor theconsumer.  It does provide a stabilised priceon a basis economic to the farmer, even under worldglut conditions, and equitable to the Consumer underworld short crop conditions,,   The Company canadvance to the Farmer V5Jo cf a value to beestablished on the delivery of wheat at harvesttime, the balance payable on the completion of the cereal year.   This enables the farmer to get readyfunds when he most needs them,18.    Such a Corporation as outlined would bepowerful enough to trade on equal terms with the greatproducing combines.   Manipulators influenced by either political or private reasons would be more likely to consider the interests of a great nationalCorporation, than they would the Interests of privatemilling Combines, who are actuated entirely byprofit considerations, regardless whether the priceof wheat is justifiably high or low.19.    An official Corporation of this character coulddirect its operations into channels which would yieldreciprocal advantages to British trade.20.    The charter of incorporation extending to theGovernment a permanent option to acquire the remaining4-9% of the Ordinary stock on an equitable basis,when it is in the interest of the Nation to do so,should disarm the most radical critic.10th March,  1930.
