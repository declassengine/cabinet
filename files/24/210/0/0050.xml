[This Document  is the Property  of  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]The Question-of the Renewal of the  Bengal  Criminal Law                    Amendment Act,  1925.       MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE  FOR INDIA.   I circulate, for perusal by my colleagues      (i) a copy of a  secret letter from the Bengal Government, dated 16th January,        explaining the grounds of their apprehension of a recrudescence of anarchical        conspiracy and of a campaign of violence and outrage  if the existing Act is        allowed to lapse on  23rd  April at the end of  its prescribed term of five        years. In the light of this apprehension the Government of Bengal advocated        the passage of legislation (in the form of  the  draft Bill aj)pended  to  their        letter) having the effect of empowering the Executive to  bring the whole        Act into force again whenever, and for so long as required ;    (ii) a copy of an official telegram from  the Government of India recording the        discussion  of the above and various alternative proposals with the Governor        of Bengal  and  his Government.  The  final proposal, which  the Bengal        Government are prepared to  accept, is to pass a Bill renewing for a further        period of  five years the first part of the existing Act, which provides for the        establishment of special tribunals for the  trial of  offences committed under        the Act.           The remaining provisions of the Act, i.e. for arrest and  detention without        trial, would be repealed ;  but it  would be  made clear,  by  an announcement        to be made by myself in Parliament simultaneously with the introduction of        the Bill in the Bengal Council, that Government would  not hesitate to resume        these powers, by  the promulgation of  an  Ordinance, immediately on the        recurrence of the conditions of  emergency in.  which  they were originally        taken in 1924. &apos;   It will  be seen from this telegram (which was only received in full on 17th March)that the intention is to  introduce the Bill  on 31st  March, and  that it must, for thispurpose, be published on  Saturday next, 22nd March.  An urgent decision  is therefore necessary; and I propose to  bring the  question  (which I have  also discussed in private correspondence with the Viceroy) before  my  colleagues in the  Cabinet onWednesday. 19th March.Printed for the Gahinel.

SECRET.                            APPENDIX I.Letter  from the  Government of Bengal to the Government  of India,  Home           Department, No. 219 P.S.,  dated  16th January 1930.      Subject: Bill to provide for the continuance of the Bengal Criminal Law                              Amendment Act, 1925.sir,       :  &apos;.                      &apos;                    &apos; ..-   .     ..       I am directed to address yon on the subject of.  the situation arising from the approaching expiry of the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1925, which ceases to be operative at midnight of the 23rd April 1930.   2. The circumstances which  led  to the assumption of special powers to deal with.terrorism  and the terrorist movement in Bengal have been fully set  forth in  the lettersNo. 8111 P. of  August 1923,  No. 6721 P. of June 1924, and No. 1360 of  September1924, addressed by this Government to the Government of  India,  together with thoreports forwarded -with  those letters,  but, in short,  it may be recalled that theGovernment of Bengal,  finding themselves faced  with a recrudescence of terroristactivity,  which it had hoped would remain quiescent after  the  institution of the reforms and the declaration of an amnesty at the close of the war,  proceeded  to showthat the processes of the law in force at the time were unsuitable and inadequate, andthat it was  essential to arm them with those powers which alone had been found byrepeated investigations and long experience to be effective in dealing with a terroristconspiracy.   3. The  Government of India, after  consideration of the representations made tothem, at first authorised the  arrest  of certain leaders under  the provisions  of regulation III of 1818.  This action brought  about a temporary check,  only to befollowed,  however,  by  the  resumption of activities under&apos; new leaders, and  theGovernment of India found it necessary to arm  the Government of Bengal with special powers of wider application, and to provide immediate safeguards by the  promulgationof an Ordinance  designed  to  enable them  to perform  the fundamental  duty  of preserving  the public security on which political advance and all  the functions of acivilised organism depend.   When the Ordinance was promulgated it was  announcedthat it would be followed by  the presentation  by the Local Government of measureswhich would be permanent.    4. In  accordance with this announcement the Government of Bengal presented tothe  Legislative Council  the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment  Bill, in  which theprovisions  of  the  Ordinance  were embodied.   This   Government  held, and hadrepeatedly expressed the view, that such an Ordinance must be followed  by legislation of a permanent nature, for experience had  shown  that  while  spasmodic attack succeeded but in exciting reprisals and political opposition, the only effective remedy was steady and constant pressure.  To  quote  the  words of the Rowlatt  Committee, &quot; The powers which we  shall  suggest  for dealing with future emergencies must  be ready at short notice.  They must therefore be on the Statute Book in advance.   That fact alone is calculated to have some moral  effect, for it is then known exactly what a renewed  anarchical movement will encounter.&quot;   Important as  this  moral effect undoubtedly is upon the terrorists themselves, its reaction  upon the supporters of Government  and  Government servants cannot be  over-estimated.   Faced with a campaign  of  widespread and deliberate  violence  it is  essential, in  order  that Government should receive the support which it requires, that it should demonstrate- an unflinching determination to  protect its servants and  supporters, and to follow consistently a  strong and sustained line of action.  Circumstances, however, which are well known to the Government of India, and which need not be recapitulated bore, impelled this Government to consent to the limitation  of the operation of the Act to five years, a period which is now rapidly drawing to a close.    5. The Bengal  Criminal  Law Amendment  Act  had  as its object the prevention of outrages.  It aimed at providing a weapon for  the restraint of persons whose continued liberty was a source of imminent danger, and  at  providing a means  of dealing with the rank and file of the movement so arrested in a more  discriminating manner than was  provided for by Regulation 111 of  1818.   It was intended to be used in such a manner as to paralyse the organisation of the terrorists for the commission of outrages, and  to dislocate their schemes for the distribution and  smuggling of  arms and the       4383   75  3.30
preparation of explosives.  It was also, hoped that, it would provide a means of dealingwith the individual in such a manner as to induce him to abandon his belief in the efficacy of terrorism and violence, while  in  addition it provided a more  expeditiousprocedure for the administration  of justice.    6. The action taken immediately after  the  promulgation  of  the   Ordinanceundoubtedly justified its  promulgation.   The  persons arrested were  all  leading members of the main  branches  of the  terrorist movement, and their apprehensionresulted in the temporary paralysis of all schemes  of  terrorist activity.  It graduallybecame evident, however, that  the action which  had  been taken  had  not prevented the  continuance of  widespread   organisation for  future violence, and that furthersuccess depended on  establishing in the  leaders and in the [country generally a  belief that Government  did not intend  to relax  their efforts to stamp out terrorist crime.Owing  to  the limited period of  the  Act this belief  was unfortunately never frimly established, while the difficulty was further increased  by the lack of power to control the propagandist activities of the Press in favour of terrorism.    7. Although the absence of crimes of violence  by members of the Anusilan  andJugantar parties showed that the action taken had been effective in checking theviolent  tendencies of  those parties for the time being, yet it was clear in 1926 that theleaders still continued to contemplate a revolution by force in the future.    8. At a  conference held in Calcutta in December 192G it was, however, decidedthat, in view of the fact that the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment  Act had  littlemore than  three years to run, it was necessary to look ahead to consider the situation that Was likely to arise on  its expiration.   To keep a possibly increasing  number ofmen in  jail up to the  last moment, without  making any efforts to  make experiments in  the  direction of relaxing restraint,  while there was yet time, might  produce a difficult and dangerous  situation.   A  policy of gradual and experimental release  wastherefore decided on, combined with more comprehensive action against groups.    9. This  policy was  successful in  that  the releases were not  followed  by a freshseries of outrages.   No arrests have been made since March 1927 and no  persons arenow under restraint, though orders under section 11  (c) are  still in force against27  persons.  Terrorist   activity  has  not ceased,  however, but  is  increasing.  Onrelease  the leaders of the different terrorist  organisations lost little time  in makingpreparations to work out a concerted programme framed  by them while  in jail, and formed  in August  1928 an amalgamated  party whose object  was to work for thecomplete independence of  India, through open  associations at first, while developingtheir secret organisations, and  ultimately to proceed to acts of open rebellion.  Theyset themselves to spread  their  influence  throughout the  country,  to  build  rip anall-Bengal volunteer organisation on  the lines of the Irish A^olunteers, to recruit more members to their secret organisation, to capture  Labour  organisations, to assist in creating situations  favourable to  disorder, and to  infuse revolutionary ideas into the&quot;minds of the people.    10.  The amalgamation  of the two main parties has  not survived the  jealousy ofthe leaders, and the component groups are now working out their policy in their ownways.   The  Anusilan party are  working  to extend  their organisation  throughout India.   They are busily collecting arms and explosives  with  a view to  organisingsimultaneous risings in  different districts,  while their immediate programme includes the commission of dacoities and establishing foreign contacts.  The Jugantar party isorganising with a view  to ultimate violent action, and Surendra Ghosh of Mymensinghhas received over Rs. 50,000 from Subhas Bose from  the Congress Exhibition funds.The party has arms and  bombs in  its  possession and is  now preparing for future action.   The Bengal branch of  the Hindustan  Republican Association is known tohave arms and bombs under its control and to have been contemplating assassinationsfrom time to time,  while close  connection has been maintained  with other provinces.Jatin Das, a leader of this branch, was,  it will be  recalled, an accused  in  the Lahoreconspiracy case.  A further  striking illustration which  may be mentioned is that thepolice have information  of a reliable nature that both Bhagat Siugh and SbadashivMalkapurkar, now under trial in  the Bhusawal bomb case, visited Pratul Ganguli, thehead of the Anusilan party in  Dacca,  prior to  the Assembly bomb  outrage,  and.arranged for the provision of arms.    11.  Dissatisfied with the cautious policy of the older  leaders, the younger members!of the Anusilan and Jugantar parties, led by certain ex-detenus, have recently decided
on a  policy of  immediate terrorism.   They have met with disquieting  success  in purchasing smuggled arms, of  which they now  possess a  considerable number-theBhowanipur group alone is reported  to have  about 30.   At a recent  meeting  in Calcutta it was declared that their immediate intention was to bring about a rebellionin two  districts, surprise the  police,&apos; capture the  treasury and armoury and make a simultaneous attack on the houses of executive officers.   The Chittagong and Barisaldistricts were to be  organised for this purpose and outrages  on police officers and europeans were to be  committed  in  Calcutta.  This  party consider, not  withoutreason,  that such concerted attacks,  even if  heavily defeated, would, by the mere fact of their being made and resolutely carried out, have  a striking moral effect, not only upon  the rising generation, but upon  the  supporters  and servants of Government.The information on record also shows  that this  party is further organising their ownintelligence branch to  watch and  identify  police  officers and to ascertain agents forassassination.   12.  Isolated cases  have already occurred  which indicate  a growing tendency towards violence and show that the older leaders are no longer able  to  control the younger elements.   The following may be cited as examples :    (1) 4th August 1928 :   Bijhari  stabbing case (Faridpur). The brother of an ex-detenu, a Jugantar member of  the New Violence party, who was suspected to be a police spy, was stabbed by student associates of the ex-detenu.   (2) 10th March 1929:  Sub-Inspector  Jyotish  Chandra  Ray  of  Barisal  wasmurdered by a member of the Jugantar party of  Satindra Nath Sen Gupta.   [3) 1st June 1929 : Highway robbery at Tejgaon  (Dacca). An  Eurasian clerk  ofthe Dacca Telegraph Office was waylaid and robbed by Anusilan members of the NewViolence party in Dacca.   (4) 6th September 1929 : An  assistant sub-inspector of the 24-Parganas  DistrictIntelligence Branch  staff was  beaten  at  Dhakuria  by  Indra Chandra Narang andanother member of the New Violence party because he was  shadowing them.   (5) llth September  1929:  Puthia  attempted dacoity (Rajshahi). A motor buscarrying mail was attacked by armed youths  belonging  to Niranjan Sen  Gupta&apos;sgroup of  refractory Jugantar-Anusilan elements  pledged  to  start a campaign  of immediate violence.   (6) 12th September  1929 :  The Elahipur (Khulna) dacoity was  committed bymembers of the local Swaraj Asram  who belong to the terrorist organisation.   (7) 3rd December 1929 : Bajitpur dacoity. Committed  by members  of NiranjanSen Gupta&apos;s group of refractory Anusilan-Jugantar elements referred to in No. (5).   13.  Information on  record received  striking  corroboration from the inquiriesarising  out  of a search  which was  made  on the 19th December last at No.  22/3,Mechuabazar  Street,  Calcutta, a  house situated in  the middle of  a  Muhammadanbustee.  In a room in this  house Niranjan  Sen Gupta, an  ex-detenu,  was known  tohave been residing in very suspicious circumstances for some weeks.  The police hadbeen  watching the premises and  had  also  received  information regarding Niranjanand his activities  which showed  that he was actively collecting arms and  bombs andthat he  intended to print and issue a  seditious leaflet.  It  was further reported thatNiranjan and his associates intended to proceed to Lahore for the Congress and then to abscond in order  to  open a campaign of terrorism.  When the search was madeNiranjan was found in the  room together with Satish Chandra Pakrashi, an ex-detenutand Ramendra Narain Biswas, a known member of  Satin Sen&apos;s group  in Barisal.   Amanuscript copy of a highly seditious leaflet was found in Ramendra&apos;s pocket.   Certainnames and  addresses were found  and also a  dagger.  These  three  persous were arrested and a watch was placed on the room.  As a result of this watch SudhangsuDas Gupta was arrested carrying a suit-case which, on examination, was found,  to contain a bomb-shell of the Maniktala type.  The shell was not loaded, but had thetrigger  set and the  rubber band attached.  Sudhangsu&apos;s  arrest led  to  the search,among other places, of 107, Harrison Road.   Here in the possession  of Dharani Bosewere found  79  printed  copies  of the &quot;revolutionary  leaflet  regarding which previousinformation was on  record  and 16  copies of the same leaflet in envelopes ready forposting. On three sheets of  paper were found details of a &quot; District OrganisationScheme &quot; divided under various heads : Explosives, Finance, Volunteer Organisation,Spy System, Communications, Resources and Force.  Under each heading was giventhe name  of the man in charge  and the persons  constituting the group.  The final paragraph  gives the  names of 43  persons  who represent  the &quot; Group  for  presentaction.&quot;                       v
    14. Another search at 23,  Mechuabazar Street, resulted in the arrest  of NishiKanta Ray Chaudhnri, an I. A. student, a known member of the terrorist party, whohad in his  possession bottles of nitric  and sulphuric acids and  potassium nitrate,together with test tubes and other apparatus for the preparation of explosives.   Thedistrict organisation scheme referred to the Barisal district, where a series of searcheswere subsequently conducted.   The &quot;group for present action &quot; included the name,&quot; Kutti.&quot;  The local police traced  the identity of  this person as Debi Priya Chatarji,a  student of the Braja Mohan College, in Barisal.  On his house  being searchedcertain documents were found.  These include  information under three heads town  information,  district  information,  and maps.   The  &quot; town information&quot;includes  (1) than as, outposts, barracks, force, armed and unarmed, number of readyguards,  rifles  and  revolvers  and  ammunition, position of magazines ;   (2)  jail:position, forces, telegraphic and other connection,  lock keys of the jail gate and prisoncell ; (3)  quarters  of higher Government officials, LB. officers  and  spies, number ofguards for their protection ;  (4) communications :  inner and outer telegraph, and post offices, their situation and guards ;  (5) Treasury : position, number of ready and reserve guards, telephonic and telegraphic connections ;   (6) Government offices andcourts and guards,  &amp;c.;  (7) numbers of  private and hired cars with the  addresses of owners; (8) banks and loan offices, co-operative  office,  their position and guards;(9)  arms and  ammunition shops ;  (10) deserted places within or without  the  townsuitable for sheltering  and  general meeting  purposes.  The  particulars under thehead  &quot; District information &quot;  follow  very much the same line.   Under  the  head*&apos; Maps&quot; were  to be noted the  position of the  houses of  officials, police-stations,outposts, &amp;c, together with  a sketch map  of  treasuries, than as, barracks, &amp;c.   the printed  leaflet  referred  to  above, which  has been  circulated in  Bengal, is of a particularly inflammatory nature.   It urges the youth, of  the  country to follow the example set by terrorists in the past both in this country  and in Ireland.  The  presswhere this leaflet was  printed has been traced and searched and the compositor hasadmitted printing  3,000 copies under  the order of Ramendra Biswas.  Up to date12 persons are under arrest in connection with this conspiracy.    15. These  searches  have  completely corroborated  the  information  or  recordregarding this group.   A  particularly disquieting feature of the situation is the largenumber of names of conspirators given in the documents seized regarding whom thepolice had no previous information.  Apart from the particular bomb-shell which wasseized, the  party are reported to be in possession of several infernal machines andfirearms, the location of which is at present unknown.     16. From what has been  said  above, it  will be apparent that, while outrages havebeen  held in check, organisation and recruitment have proceeded  steadily  with increasing  momentum  and  increasingly ambitions objectives.   The  older  leaders have exercised a  restraining  influence, which, though only partially  effective,  hashone the less had  its effect.   They have done  so, not. from any change of outlook orabhorrence of  outrages, but because of a knowledge  that while the Act was in force a recrudescence of outrages would inevitably result in their own incarceration.   When the Act lapses they will no longer have any motive for  stemming the rising tide ofimpatience  among their younger followers.  It is  idle  in  the light of  experience toLope  that  political concessions will avert a further outbreak of  terrorist outrages.The terrorist has no belief or faith in constitutional agitation or in the efficacy of the leaders of political parties, however extreme in their views.  Asa class the terrorist now, as always, pins his faith to violence as being the only method  which will crown his efforts with success, and  it  is only  if he knows that outrages will  certainly and immediately be followed by  drastic action  under a measure such as the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act that there will be any hope of restraining his activities. Moreover, while terrorist outrages  have been held in check in  Bengal, there are clear indications  that the cult of violence has spread to other  provinces.  The result is shown by  the disclosures in  the  Kakori conspiracy case,  the shooting of Jitendra Banarji, Deputy Superintendent of Police,  at Benares,  the  bomb outrage  in the Assembly,  the Lahore bomb  case,  the  Manmad case and  the  Bhusawal bomb  case. In all these cases a link can be traced with Bengal terrorist groups.     17. The Governor-in-Council  therefore regards  the approaching  lapse of  the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act  with profound misgiving.   He feels that the Government of Bengal may, at any moment, be faced with a situation such as  was envisaged   by the  Rowlatt Committee, namely,  a campaign  of  widespread  and
deliberate violence,  to  meet which, in the words  of  the  Rowlatt Committee,  it isessential that  it should  demonstrate an unflinching determination to protect  itssupporters and take a strong line of action.  Were the Act allowed to lapse from theStatute Book  the restraining influences  referred to  above  would  be  immediatelyremoved from the terrorist groups.  The risk of outrages would certainly be increased,and  if  they  followed the morale of the police  would be shaken,  the intelligence organisation which  they have built up would be shattered,  possibly beyond repair,and  the terrorist organisations would immediately gain a  large number of adherentsfrom the discontented intelligentsia among the student community, whose minds havebeen consistently poisoned  by  propaganda in  the Press  and on public  platforms.Public confidence, which  has  to some extent been restored by the peaceful conditionssecured  by  the  operation  of  the Act,  would   disappear.  Such a situation  must inevitably be met sooner or later by the only means which has ever proved  efficaciousin Bengal in  the past, namely, by the use of special powers such as those given bythe Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act.  His  Excellency in Council feels  strongly that it would be far better to minimise the chances of a recrudescence of terrorism byretaining the weapon which is already in existence than to increase them by abandoningit.   It would, no doubt, be possible, if the Act were allowed  to lapse, to meet a fresh.outbreak by a fresh Ordinance and  the  re-enactment of  the Bengal Criminal law amendment Act.  But it is the considered  and  emphatic  opinion of the Governmentof Bengal that such  an outbreak would  be far  more likely to occur if the Act were allowed  to lapse than if it were retained, since the  terrorists are well aware of therepugnance with -which recourse  to such  measures is viewed  in England as well as inIndia.   A  further consideration which His Excellency in. Council  is confident willweigh with the Government of India, in favour of taking steps to  minimise as far aspossible the chances of a fresh outbreak, is that a  new campaign of terrorism, followed,as it must be, by the incarceration without trial of a considerable number of persons,would be the greatest possible obstacle to the creation and maintenance of an atmospherefavourable to  the success of the Round-Table  Conference which is to  be convenedin England to solve  the problem of India&apos;s future.  For, in the future, as in the past,detention without trial, on information which cannot be disclosed to the public, whoare  unaware of the secret  activities  of  the persons  dealt with  and in many casesgenuinely believe them  to be worthy citizens  without a taint of criminal  tendencies,cannot fail to engender  an  atmosphere of distrust and suspicion.  At the same time,His Excellency in Council recognises  that there are grave political objections to the initiation of legislation with a view merely to give permanence to the Bengal criminal law Amendment Act and to continue it in force without a break  after the 23rd April1930.   He therefore recommends the adoption of a middle course, and  urges thatsanction be  given  to a  Bill to amend  section  1  (I) of  the Bengal Criminal law amendment Act in such a  way that, whilst the Act will not lapse on the 23rd ofApril  1930, as originally intended, but will remain on the  Statute Book, it will beextended or  again  be brought into force only by  a  notification   issued with  theprevious sanction of the Governor-General in Council  if and when he is satisfied that conditions in Bengal are such as to  require  the use of the special powers which itconfers.  Being on  the Statute  Book the Act would remain  as  a check on terroristorganisations.  The onus of  bringing it into operation would be transferred from government to the  terrorist groups.  I am to enclose a draft Bill which is designedto  give effect to this  proposal.  It provides  either for the  extension  of  the Actimmediately after the  23rd April 1930,  in which  event any orders at that time inforce under the Act would continue, or for its subsequent enforcement.:    18. The foregoing paragraphs  take no  account  of such  recent happenings as the-attempt on the life of His Excellency the Viceroy and  the  proceedings of the recentsession of  the  Congress at Lahore at which a large majority Of the Bengal delegates&quot;voted   against  the   resolution  condemning  the  outrage  and  congratulating  HisExcellency on  his escape.  Though it is  at present premature to try to estimate  the precise effect of these incidents and of the declaration that  the goal of the Congressis  complete  independence,  it  may  safely be  predicted  that they will encourage the  terrorists,  and  particularly  the younger  and more excitable members of their-organisations,  to embark upon a fresh campaign of violence.  A situation may arise in the near future which  will  compel  this Government to  use their  powers under the bengal  Criminal Law  Amendment Act,  which  they  have&apos; for a  considerable periodavoided rising, to place  certain persons under restraint; and the existence of such a-situation would make it necessary to ask for a continuance of such powers.   But the
Governor in Council has preferred to base his request for sanction to legislation in.the modified form proposed on  known facts rather than on  speculation as to how the political outlook may develop.   -                                         I have, &amp;c,                                              W. D. R.  PRENTICE,                                   Chief Secretary to the Government  of Bengal.                                   ANNEXURE.         The Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act (Continuance) Bill, 1930.         A BILL to provide for the continuance of the Bengal Criminal Law                              Amendment Act,  1925.    WHEREAS the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act,  1925, is limited to  expire five years from the date of its commencement;    AND WHEREAS it is expedient to provide for the continuance of the said Act;    AND WHEREAS the previous  sanction  of the  Governor-General  has been obtained under subsection (3) of section 80A of the Government of India Act to the passing of this Act;    It is hereby enacted as follows :     1.  This Act may be called the  Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act Continuance- Act, 1930.  &quot;.  2.  In section 1 of the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1925, for subsection (4). the following shall be substituted, namely :     &quot; (4) It  shall cease to be in force  five years from its commencement unless this period is extended by the local Government by a  notification or successive notifications in the Calcutta Gazette made with  the previous sanction of the Governor-General in Council and on its so ceasing  to be  in force  it shall again  come  into  force only whenever and for such time as  the local Government by notification  in  the Calcutta Gazette made with the  previous sanction  of the Governor-General in  Council may direct.&quot;                         Statement of Objects and Reasons.    Section  1 (4) of the Bengal Criminal Law  Amendment  Act, 1925, provides that it shall continue in force for live  years from the date of its commencement.  Unless this provision is  modified in the meanwhile, the Act will  lapse at midnight on  the 23rd April  1930.   Secret terrorist organisations are still  in  active existence  and it would be premature and dangerous to allow the Act to  be removed  from the Statute Book.    The present Bill does not provide that  the  Act shall necessarily remain in active operation after the 23rd April 1930.  It provides, however, that it may be extended or  again be brought into force  by notification made with the previous sanction of  the Governor-General in Council if and when he is satisfied that conditions in  Bengal are such as to require the use of the special powers  which the Act confers.

We addressed Bengal on 17th February, pointiug out that it  seemed to us to be implicit in principle of the Bill forwarded  by them that periods  for which the  Act should be brought into force should be strictly limited to immediate emergenc3r -which,. at the moment of issue of notification, confronted the  Government, and  consequently that it would be possible to extend, the Act on each occasion only for a comparatively brief period.  At the expiry of that period the Government would again  be faced with. the difficult problem of deciding  whether the Act should be  continued  for a further period, and there might be series  of political crises as these various periods expired, while police would always be  kept in a state  of  uncertainty  as  to whether powers would be renewed or not. . Further, we suggested  that objection  of&apos; principle might lie taken to form of draft  Bill,  which amounted  to granting power  to  revive, by                * See Government of Bengal&apos;s letter of  16th January Appendix I.;:
-executive order, an  enactment  which had ceased to be  in  force, and had  thus, in-effect, ceased&apos;to exist.   We further  asked Bengal on  23rd February whether they:-considered  there was a reasonable prospect that draft Bill forwarded by them wouldbe passed by Legislative Council, and on  the other hand, that a Bill  for continuingexisting Act for another five years would not  be passed.    2. On the 28th February, Bengal replied.  They stated that they would much prefer to have an amending Bill which would bring the Act  into  force permanently,but had not suggested this in view of political objections which  they felt  might beraised to such a  proposal.   They did not agree that it was implicit in principle oftheir Bill that period for which the Act was brought into force on each occasion mustnecessarily  be comparatively brief, and  argued  that  if it were brought into force forbrief time,  such action would not be effective.   Unless,  therefore, we were preparedto abandon  this view, only  safe course would  seem to  be to continue  the Act in forcewithout any limitation by  the simple repeal  of  subsection (4) of  section 1, and if wewere prepared to do this, Bengal would gladly accept such a decision.    3.  With regard to objection of form, they argued that  this was merely  a detail of drafting, and could  be surmounted by drafting in a  different form.   With regard toour enquiry of 23rd February, they stated that neither Bill would  have much  chanceof acceptance.  They added, however,  that  Governor in Council was  not  in favourof suggestion to  extend present Act for a  period  of  five years only, which would necessitate  question of need for legislation being again  considered at the end of thatperiod.   They Avould  much prefer that an3T decision that may have to be takenperiodically should  be  taken by Executive.   Governor in Council therefore pressed for  legislation in a permanent  and not a  temporary form.  It  was clear  from  this letter and from subsequent  discussion  that  Bengal  Government had  hoped  by the-original draft  Bill to secure legislation which would remain  permanently on the Statute Book, like, for instance,  Seditious Meetings Act, but  that  the operation of it, instead of being occasional, would be for prolonged and possibly continuous periods, the effect thtis being very similar to permanent continuance  of the Act.  Sir Provash Mitter  appended a note in  which he  explained that he was in favour of limiting the Act to  five  years.  It was further stated that, whilst  Governor was in  general agree- ment wdth  views expressed in letter, he had strong doubts as to  policy  of  legislation-at the  moment, and proposed to place his views personally before  the Viceroy.     4.  Accordingly, Governor and Home Member came to Delhi- and discussed matters fully on 3rd March with Viceroy and  Home Member of the Government of India. As  a result of this discussion and further consideration in Council, we telegraphed to Bengal on 5th March that we considered it was not possible to propose  permanent retention of Act,  nor were we prepared to supj)ort proposal contained in letter of 16th January as further explained in  letter  dated  28th Eebruaiy, as we did not feel that we could agree  to use of the Act  in the manner contemplated by Bengal.   We stated  that there appeared to be  only two effective alternatives :       (a) To  continue the Act without  an interval for a period of five years.     (6)  To  allow  provisions regarding detention without trial  to lapse,  making  it clear at the same time, by an  announcement, that there would  be no hesitation in re-enacting  powers whenever  the  Government  were  convinced  that   they  were required, while  provisions regarding special procedure  should be continued without interval for a period of five years.     5.  On 7th March, Bengal telegraphed that  they  had  decided to submit as  final proposal alternative (b), and that their considered estimate was that the morale of the police  would not be adversely affected by the adoption of this  alternative, a point on which we had asked their definite opinion.   On  Sth March, they forwarded a  draft Bill to secure the continuance  of those  sections of  the Act which provide special -procedure.   There was some doubt  as  to whether, under  this draft  Bill, proceedings started under the existing Act could legally  be continued  after the date of its expiry, and also whether the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment (Supplementary) Act, 1925* would require re-enactment in order to  preserve the right of  appeal.   Our view is that, if the Bill is  cast directly and plainly in  the form  of an amendment to  the- Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1925, there would be no room for doubt on. -either point.  We are therefore proposing to Bengal  that  the terms of the Bill should be as  given in the di-aft appended.!     * This Act, which was a (certified) measure by the Central Legislature, provided for certain matters relating&apos; to appeals and revision, and place of  detention, which were not within the competence of the  Bengal Legislature.     t See Annexure.  The Bengal Government have since telegraphed accepting the terms of the draft.
   6. On question of policy we have DO hesitation in supporting  proposal  of  BengalGovernment.  The political difficulties in the way of proposing continuance of powers-of detention without trial at a time when they have not been Used  for some three years are very considerable,  and we regard reluctance of  Governor  to  recommend  thiscourse as decisive.  It is clear from latest  communication from.  Governor of  Bengalthat  this view has been  accepted  by his Government as a whole.  At the same time,it is  an essential part of policy of allowing this part of the Act to lapse that it shouldbe accompanied by plain guarantee that powers would be revived in case of  provedemergency.   The Governor contemplates : (a) That assurance should  be  given  thatGovernor-General,  on being  satisfied  by  Government  of  Bengal that  a  seriousemergency had arisen, would immediately authorise the promulgation of an Ordinancereintroducing powers  which  would  have to  be followed up  by local legislation;(b) that  Secretary of State should make a statement in Parliament  to the  effect that,in agreeing to lapse of these powers, he appreciated necessity of  their revival in  caseof such an emergency,  and was prepared  to  approve  promulgation of an Ordinanceimmediately he was satisfied that a state of emergency had arisen ;  (c) that it shouldbe made plain that as issue of Ordinance might take some little time and necessity ofarresting individual might  be immediate, the Government of India would, if necessityarose, agree to deal with such individuals under Regulation III pending the issue ofthe Ordinance.   These assurances are an essential  part of the  proposal and we consider that  theyare necessary in order to maintain confidence of  the police, and, so far as  may be, to impress the terrorists with our determination to  use  against them all our  existing powers if necessity  arises.  We shall consider further exact form of statement orstatements to be made and  forward our definite suggestions.   7. It is also in our opinion an  essential part of the proposals that special procedure should be  continued without a break.  This procedure  has  proved of the  gratest value, and  by enabling  the police to put cases into Court with, reasonable prospect ofsuccess  pro  tanto  diminishes  the necessity for having recourse  to  the  powers of detention without trial.  The special  procedure has been used  on  two occasions in1925, three  in  1926, three  in 1927 and two  in  1930.   One  important case  against27 accused persons, vide our telegram of the 21st ultimo, No. 589 S., is  at  present under trial.  It is improbable that this will be completed by 23rd April, when thepresent Act expires.  The experience  of the Lahore  conspiracy  case shows  how important it is in a province like Bengal  to retain this special procedure  for dealingwith cases of revolutionary conspiracy.   8. The Government of  Bengal ask for  very early orders.   Their present sessioncontinues until 29th March.  The intention is to extend  the session, and they wouldlike  to move, if possible, on the 31st March, that the Bill  be taken into consideration.Under standing orders, copies of the Bill must have been made  available  for use ofmembers for seven days   before motion  is  made.  The  Bill, therefore,  should bepublished in the Gazette not later than the 22nd March, if a motion is to be made onthe 31st instant.  We regret that the  case should be put before  you in circumstancesof such urgency, but as explained above it has been a matter of considerable difficulty to arrive at these agreed conclusions,  which have  the support both of the Governmentof Bengal and of ourselves.  We strongly urge their acceptance.                                   ANNEXURE.      A BILL to Amend the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1925 for                                 Certain Purposes.

EAST INDIA  (CRIME).                            No.  1.DESPATCH  FROM  THE   GOVERNOR-GENERAL  TO  THE    SECRETARY  OB1  STATE  FOR   INDIA,  DATE 0  22ND    JANUARY 1925.         The Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1925.My Lord,      I have the honour to  forward herewith  an authentic copyof the Act noted above, which, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2) of section 72E,  I have reserved for the signification ofHis Majesty&apos;s pleasure.  The  endorsement printed at the head of-theauthentic copy of the Act will show that the  Beng,d  LegislativeCouncil refused leave to introduce the Bill, and that His Excellencytbe Governor,  in exercise of the  power vested in  him  by sub-section (1) of section 72E, certified that the passage of  the Bill  was essential for the discharge of his responsibility for the provincialreserved subject described as &quot; Administration of Justice &quot; (item 17in Part  II of  Schedule  I to the Devolution Rules  made  undersection 45A of the Government of India Act).  The circumstances which necessitated the passage of the Bill are those which necessitated the making  and promulgation by me of the Bengal Criminal law amendment Ordinance, 1924, on 25th October  1924.  Those circum-stances  were set out in  a statement issued to me at the time  and published in the Gazette uf India.  A copy of  that statement is  sentas an enclosure to this letter.   The period for  which the Ordinancehas the force of law is limited  to  six months by the provisions ofsection 72, and  it was  therefore  essential  that, before the expiry ofthis period, an enactment  of  the local Legislature should be passed to take  its place.  With  this  intention  the Home  Member  of the bengal  Government moved in the Bengal  Legislative  Council on 7th January 1925 for leave  to  introduce  the Bill,  and leave  was refused  on  the same day.  His  Excellency the Governor of  Bengalthereupon  made the certificate  in the terms referred to  above, and placed his signature below a copy of the Bill in  the form in whichit was proposed  to be introduced.  The Bill thereupon  became an act of the local Legislature,  and in accordance  with  the provisionsof subsection  (2) of section 72E I  have  reserved  the  Act  for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure.   In addition to the enclosure referred  to  above, copies  of the papers relating  to the Act which  are mentioned in the accompanyinglist are enclosed.

       STATEMENT  OF  OBJECTS  AND  REASONS.   (1) A statement by His Excellency the Governor-Generalof the reasons which  have moved him, in the exercise of thepowers conferred upon him by section  72 of  the Government ofIndia Act, to  make and promulgate the Bengal Criminal law amendment Ordinance, 1924 (I of 1924), was published in  aCalcutta  Gazette Extra ordinary, dated  the 25th October 1 924.In another Calcutta Gazette Extraordinary of the same date,the Resolution No. 10580  P. of the Government of Bengal inthe Political Department, set forth the reasons which have led the Governor  in   Council  to  ask the  Governor-General  topromulgate such an Ordinance.   (2) The present Bill has for its object the continuance  byenactment by  local legislation of  the  provisions of the BengalCriminal  Law  Amendment Ordinance, 1924 (I of 1924), since that Ordinance is limited under section 72 of  the Governmentof India Act to expire at the end of six months from the date ofits promulgation.                                      11.

His EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR  OF  BENGAL  (THE earl of LYTTON) : Gentlemen,-This Council has met, as you know, ina special session for one purpose, and one  purpose alone, namely,to consider the proposals of my Government for suppressing terroristcrime in the Province.   I  shall not discuss the provisions  of theBill which will be submitted to you or say an3Tthing to-day of a controversial character.   The only  justification for  a  Bill of  thiskind is that the welfare of  the  State as a whole is in danger  andthat the danger cannot be averted by any other means.  In the speeches which I have recently made I  have tried to explain thecircumstances in which  my  Government have  felt  constrained totake this action and to  restrain the liberty of a few men  in orderthat the. liberty of many may be secured.  It is not necessary forrue to  repeat what I  have already said and it will  be for you to
deckle when you have heard the case, which of  the two evils is thegreater, that a secret organisation should be lefc free to threaten theHves  of those  of  whom they  die-approve,  or  that  the ordinaryprocesses of law should be suspended, for a limited time and in thecase of  a few individuals, in order to prevent  the commission  of violent  crime, and the spread of terrorism throughout the Province.    Any Government which seeks to employ exceptional measuresto deal with exceptional conditions must satisfy the general public that the special powers  will  only be used to  deal with  the specialcircumstances and  that all reasonable safeguards have  been  pro-vided against their abuse or their application to ordinary political activities.  In the  Bill which we have  drafted and which, will  besubmitted to you to-day we have endeavoured to provide such safe-guards, and to limit the use of the powers which the Bill containsto those conditions  alone  which have  constituted the danger to theState against which the Bill is aimed.  You will have to determinewhen you come to discuss the  clauses of the  Bill how far we havebeen successful.  I earnestly hope  that when  you have heard  fromthe Hon&apos;ble Member the case for the Bill of  which he is in charge,3 on will realise  the necessity for some legislation of this kind andwill help the Government to  make its  provisions as effective  aspossible for dealing with an admitted danger.    Gentlemen, I recognise that the subject-matter of this Bill isintensely controversial.  It would be improper for  me to  makeany speech on this occasion which would aggravate the controversyor embitter the  discussion.  My sole object   in coming to  addressyou at all is, if possible, to make it easier for all of you to conductyour debate in  a spirit of mutual tolerance  and respect.  Differ-ences of opinion in political  matters  there  must always be  in a healthy State, also  personal rivalries  among leaders and strugglesof contending parties  for power, and these  things will often callforth  bitter expressions in the clash of argument in debate.   Insuch matters, so far as  they exist in  Bengal, it is always my desireto keep aloof and detached as far as possible, not  to take sides but tobe  an  impartial friend to all  those who, in  the  exercise of their constitutional lights, are  willing to accept my friendship or advice.In  the  present  transitional stage of the constitution, this  task is rendered extraordinarily difficult by reason of the divided responsi-bility which is placed  upon  me.  But it is  made far more difficult by the  existence in  this  country  of  a deep-rooted  distrust  ofGovernment as such which does not exist elsewhere.   I recognisethat this is due to the  fact that the Government in this country has for so   long been  without any element  of  responsibility to repre-sentatives of an  electorate.  Parliament has also  recognised this factand has in recent  years pledged  itself to a  policy of progressiveadvance towards full responsibility and representative  Government.The success of this  policy in its initial stage is, however, stillhampered by that spirit of mistrust which is studiously fostered  inthe Indian Press.    In the last few weeks  this  measure which  we  have felt obligedto introduce has been made even more controversial than its naturenecessitates by the  constant  reiteration in the Press  of  the charge that the Government of Bengal has abused its  powers in the past.They  haVe  been accused of fabricating  false charges, of plantingarms  upon innocent men, and of trying to secure convictions  byperjured &apos; evidence.   It  is  also   stated and has recently  been repeated by an ox-Member of the Secretary of State&apos;s Council that
the High Court have on oceasious condemned them for their action.These general and in that form wholly undeserved charges  proveon investigation to be founded almost always on a single case namely, the Mussalmanpara bomb case of 1914-, and it is time thatthe Government and its police  officers should once and for all be-absolved from the absolutely false charge which is so often repeatedagainst them in connection with that case.   Whenever in  all the miasma of  falsehood which  clouds  the actions  of Government in  this country I have wanted to reveal the truth, I  have generally been prevented by the need of secrecy by considerations of somebody&apos;s  life or reputation.   It happens, how-ever, that by a strange chain of circumstances I am in a position totell the  truth concerning this one case, and I am going to do so inthe hope and belief  that it will help everyone to escape from theunhappy situation in which we  are all placed.   Gentlemen,  in that case there was  an error  &apos;&quot;f our imperfecthuman  justice and  a remarkable illustration of  divine  justice.  Aguilty man was declared innocent, but whereas if he had been foundguilty the only thing which the law could have done with him inthe name of justice would have been to hansr him by the neck until he was dead, or (o shut him up in prison for life, by a miscarriage ofjustice,  or may we suppose by the intervention  of Providence, hewas declared innocent. His life was given back to him and a chanceafforded to  him  to redeem the past.  This  unexpected, and someperhaps may think undeserved, opportunity has since been gloriouslyutilised, and the man has abundantly made good.  The divine  law of the forgiveness of sins has in his case triumphed over  the humanlaw of retribution a life for a  life.   Perhaps you  will remind methat three High  Court Judges declared the accused man in that case to  be innocent  and condemned the prosecution for trying to destroy  him by perjured evidence, and you may ask me what right,what justification I can have for now declaring him to be guilty.  Ido not of  course criticise the verdict of the Court  on the  evidence before it, but my answer is that I am privileged to know the man and that I am not ashamed to call  him my friend. My authorityfor what  I  have  said is no less a one  than his own.  The  story of how I  came to  make his  acquaintance, and of  my  subsequentrelations with  him  is one of  the  most dramatic  and  interestingepisodes of  my life.  Let me tell it to you as shortly and as  simplyas I can.  I first  heard of  him when I visited Newcastle  in 1921with the Indian Students&apos; Committee.  1 then  learnt from  all theauthorities at that University, that Nogendra Nath Sen Gupta  was&quot;the best student, the best scholar and the fineBt character that  hadever come  to  them.  They  could not  speak  too highly  of  thewonderful influence which  this man had exercised while he was intheir midst.  On  my return to  London, I made enquiries about thestudent who had been recommended to me in such glowing terms and found that  he was none other than the accused in the Mussal-manpara bomb case, of which I had never heard  till that  moment.I then looked into the  records of the case  at the  India Office  and found unmistakable proof of his guilt;  I marvelled that  so muchgood had  come out of so  much evil.  When I came to Bengal thefollowing  year I  made his acquaintance.  He  was living  at thattime at  the Oxford Mission at Behala, and the good opinions I  had heard of him in  England were confirmed by those who knew himmost intimately at that time.  I  found that he had  sincerely repentedof the crime of his  youth and  had determined ,to devote  the  life
which had been given back to him to making amends for  the past and  to saving others from  falling into the same error.  But  a difficulty  confronted  him.   His position before the world was a false one.   He was regarded as the innocent victim of Governmentoppression and in that capacity he was wedded to falsehood for life.On the other hand  to surrender the certificate of innocence whichhe had received from the law required a higher  standard of moralcourage than I was prepared  to find in any man.  I did eventuallyfind, however, to my surprise and delight, that the character whichiiad been  so strongly recommended  to me by  tho-e  who  knew itwas great  enough even for this supreme test, and I learnt that  hewas prepared, at whatever cost to himself, to correct the injusticewhich belit-f  in his innocence involved and to stand before theworld in  his  true  colours as a  man who, in the  mistaken belief that  he was thereby serving a righteous cause, had committed agrievous crime in  his youth but who, by his subsequent blamelessconduct and hard  work, had made atonement.   Although this was indicated  to me  soon after I first met him it was a long time before i feljt I knew him well enough to discuss with him face to face the sacrifice which  he was prepared to make, and  then  only  when Ibecame convinced  that the greatest service he could now render tohis country was to dispel by the light of truth the falsehood andprejudice  which had gathered  round the case in which  he was involved.   He has recently  given me  his  permission to  tell the truth, subject  to this single condition that I shall make it clear thatin confessing  his  own  guilt he had not incriminated anyone else.He has now removed by  a  supreme act of  self-sacrifice the  onlyburden which still rested on his conscience and he  stands absolvedin the eyes of God and man.   I hope that those true  friends  whobelieved in his innocence and stood by him in adversity  will notthink  the  worse but the better of  him for this confession, and Irejoice to  know  that he can now take in friendship the hand of themen whom he once sought to kill.  He  has passed  through the fire and  come out purified, and the truth in this dark story has at lastbeen revealed.   Gentlemen, I have told this story not  merely for the purpose of clearing a former  Government of a false charge, but in the  hopethat this example may help us without any submission or surrenderon one side more  than  on the other to find  a common  meetingground.   You know  the saying  once uttered  by  the founder ofChristianity, though the purport of it is not confined  I believe tothe Christian religion but is common to many others, &quot; know ye the truth and  the  truth shall make you free.&quot;  Here  is a truth by which one man  has  made himself  free.   May  we  not all use this  sametruth  to  make  ourselves  free also-from the  antagonism which now enslaves us ?   &quot;With this example before us of  all the  evil that must result from hatred  and  violence and of all the  good  that canfollow the abandonment  of such methods, can  we not all join inoffering to the young patriotic  men of Bengal a better way of serving their  country than by importing arms  and manufacturingbombs  for the destruction of its  supposed  enemies ?  I appeal toyou with  all the force I can  command to help us in saving  yourcountry from  the greatest evil which can  overtake  it.   If you onceallow secret terrorism to be established in your midst it will become a habit that you will never be able to eradicate.  It is not merelyBritish officials  who are affected by it and no .change in the form ofGovernment will  get rid of it.   It will  be resorted to  by  any
discontented minority under any form of Government.  Some of you know that this evil  has already spread to a dangerous extent.  Ithas even been used against some members  of  this Council  in thecourse of their ordinary political activities  and in the exercise  oftheir  constitutional  rights.   If  you do not  make  a  firm  andcourageous stand against it now it will  become  the  ruin of yourcountry, and a far greater menace to your personal liberty than thislaw which  my Government  is  placing  before  you  can ever be.Some of  you again may sympathize with, the motives which  inspirethese  methods of  terrorism  to-day,  but  if  these   methods  are successful it will be your turn to be  destroyed  by them to-morrow.Your  Swaraj Government when it comes, will  never have a  chanceof success if you once admit  the  right of those who disapprove ofit to threaten the murder of those who are responsible for it.   Gentlemen, we all deplore the necessity for special  legislation ofthis kind, but you will not get rid of that  necessity by rejecting this bill.  You can do  something better than  that.   You can  help  tomake it a dead letter when it is passed.  Some of you have influence with the  men who have  adopted  terrorism as a means to their end.I appeal  to you to take to heart the story I have just told you and tomake it the starting point of a new chapter  in the political  historyof Bengal.  If  you will  persuade these men to sink  their weapons in the waters of the  Hooghly and to abandon terrorism once for allas a political  method, we will promise you  our  whole-hearted co-operation in providing them with  other and better ways  of servingtheir country.  I offer you my assistance with both hands in  finding the best means of progressing towards the realisation of those idealswhich we have  in  common.  With  your  help  and goodwill  my government can do more good to those who look to us for assistancethan we can do against your oppo.-it.ion.  With our help you can do more  good in remedying the many social and  economic  grievancesof the people than  you can  if you are  wasting your energies inbarren political controversy.  We cannot in this Council settle theconstitution of India, but  we  can,  if we  will,  build  up  in  the villages and  countiw districts  of  Bengal workable self-governingrepresentative institutions which will serve as a solid foundation  onwhich the final structure of  provincial  self-government can after-wards be raised.  That  is in our power that  we can do ou:selveswithout reference to  the Government of India or to Parliament ; isit not the best service we can render to the people of Bengal ?  Is it not the best service which Bengal can render to the people of  India ?   If  this Council will  resolve to-day that terrorism and  secretconspiracy shall cease and  that all  parties  shall  come together toevolve the best possible system of  local self-government in the rural districts to serve as a foundation for  ultimate provincial self-govera-ment, future generations will have cause to  bless  your labours andto say of  this Council that it proved a turning point in  the consti-tutional history of India, as it turned Bengal  from the wildernessof profitless  strife in which  she  was wandering and  set her feetupon  a  broad highway which led straight  to the promised land ofher political aspirations.&apos;   His Excellency the Governor then left the Council, preceded bythe Honourable the President.   The Hon. Sir HUGH STKPHENSOX :  I ask for leave of the Councilto introduce a Bill to amend the Criminal Law in Bengal.  The Bill is     104                                                   B
 in the hands of members and it will be observed that it follows the provisions of Ordinance No. 1 of 1924 to supplement the ordinary criminal law in Bengal.  The operation of the Bill  is limited to five years ;  in  the  view of Government there are weighty  reasons for enacting the Bill in a permanent form.  This was  the view of the Rowlatt Committee who say :  &quot; The powers which we shall suggest for dealing with future emergencies must be ready for use  at short notice.   They  must, therefore, be on the Statute Book  in advance. That fact  alone is calculated to have some  moral effect,  for it  is then known  exactly  what a  renewed  anarchical movement  will encounter.  To postpone  legislation till  the  danger is imminent  is in  our view  to  risk  a recurrence  of  the history of the  years.190G-1917.&quot;  But in deference to the views of the supporters of Government we have limited its operation to five years.  There are one or two differences chiefly due to the fact that in  certain matters this Council is not competent to legislate.  The most conspicuous of these is the omission of clause 9 of the Ordinance  which gives the right of appeal to the High Court to persons tried  by the Tribunal ; there is no intention of taking away this right of  appeal and I am authorised to  say that a  Bill will be introduced in the  Imperial Legislature to provide for it.    I do not want to take up the time of  the  Council  by too lengthy a repetition of facts and arguments that have already been put before the public, but I trust that you, Sir, and  the  Council  will bear with me if I place as concisely as I can before the  Council the case for the enactment of the  legislation I desire to introduce.    The reasons which lead the Government  of Bengal to ask for extraordinary powers  and  the Governor-General to promulgate the Ordinance have been set forth in detail in the two resolutions issued simultaneously with the Ordinance.    As matters already known to the public  in connection with the conspiracy three murders,  two  attempted murders, the discovery  of a! bomb factory  and the  issue  of inflammatory Red Bengal leaflets announcing &quot;a campaign of ruthless assassination of  police officers&quot; and the condemnation &quot; to be despatched forthwith&quot; of all who  in any degree help Government were mentioned ; the public were also told that Government had  definite information of five distinct and specific attempts to assassinate individuals  since  the beginning  of July last, which had never been published.   I have been asked why Government  did not act  immediately&apos;  after  some  public  outrage which would  have attracted sympathy  to their side.  My reply is that in dealing with  a conspiracy such as  this the  significance of overt acts whether individually or collectively can  only be estimated by those who know the inner history of the conspiracy. Government could  rightly  be blamed  for  acting  hastily if  they  took stern measures merely  because  an overt act was  spectacular, while they would be  false to their own  responsibility if they refused to take. such  action merely  because  there were no overt acts when their information convinced them that the conspiracy was dangerous.   In the Government  statement the Serajganj resolution praising Gopi Nath Shaha is referred to  as the starting point of  a new impetus  to the conspiracy ;  our  information is that for one reason or another pressure was thereafter brought to bear on the leaders, not altogether successfully, to postpone overt acts and strengthen  their organisation and, a matter of very great importance, our  information  shows that one important section of the  conspiracy   were relieved of the necessity of obtaining funds for their  operations and the support  of
 absconders through the old  channels of: dacoities and obtained their fnnds from elsewhere.   The  House  will  appreciate tho immense strength this  lent to  the organisation.  I do not propose to labour the point, because the existence of a terrorist conspiracy is common ground with the majority of this Council, and I think I can go so far as to say that  no member of the Council has any reasonable doubt upon the subject.   I will only add to the testimony already received that of a prominent revolutionary who is an absconder.  In a leaflet quite recently distributed, and proscribed by Government only last week, Sachindra Nath Sanyal, whose revolutionary history may be familiar to  many of  you, says : &quot; Those who  say that there is no revolutionary party  in India  and  so the  promulgation  of the repressive laws  is an  oppression,  are not telling the truth ; for such an organisation  of a  very big  size  really exists   in  India. This party are endeavouring to bring  about independence of India through armed  revolution.&quot;  I would like, however, to  say a few words as to the nature, extent and danger of the conspiracy.  I will first quote  from  a synopsis of  the scheme of organisation  drawn up some time ago  by a leader who is now  a State prisoner.  After touching on the system of discipline and the sphere of  activities, he lays down under the heading topography a series of sub-heads under which  information should  be  collected and recorded; the last five headings are significant, namely :    Government institutions (a) courts, (Ji) than as, (e) treasury and        (d) post and telegraph offices.   Police stations number and reserved armed police.   Railway station and railway line.   Ein vpean quai&apos;tei&apos;S.   Houses of monied men necessary information.   The next  heading is &quot;information and  spying&quot;;  the first four sub-heads here are    (1)  Activities of other groups.   (.2) Activities of Government.   (3) Government strength.   (4) Sources of accumulating  strength (r/.) men,  (ft) money,  (c)        ammunition.   Coming to training, this is divided into physical and  military ; the military is  subdivided into  (1) shooting, (2) dagger  practices, (3) explosives, (4) lathi.   Under the heading Intellectual  Training is  comprised, I quote the  words &quot;a  comprehensive  study of  the  last  revolutionary movement witli  a  view to reorganise the society on a stronger basis by being more careful  than on the  former occasion.   Enforcement of the principle of secrecy and strict  military discipline  so  tar as practical works are concerned.&quot;   I  do not think it  is  necessary to  add any  comments on thesequotations.   As regards the extent of  the conspiracy I will refer  to papersfound recently with another member  who  is now under restraintunder the  Ordinance.   He had  been  commissioned to organiseoutside  this Province  by  a secret committee, and  a copy  of  theresolutions of that committee were found on him.  I will  quote &quot;five of these resolutions    (1) That only two departments be set up at present          (a)  Propaganda.         (ft) Collection of funds and arms.
   (2) That the  following  immediate steps  be  taken as regards           propaganda through newspapers and magazines which           can be utilised by members of different centres          (a) to set up a campaign against the 0.1. D. activities ;         (&amp;)  to  set up a campaign against  repressive  laws  and              measures ;         (c)  to criticise Congress activities  that hinder the work of             the association ;         (d) to  preach social revolutionary ideas and communistic             principles ;         (e)  to  collect stories, episodes and  other material  for             publication.   (3) That every possible  care be taken as regards the secrecy of       the activities of the Association.   (4) That every district organiser should try his best to help the       local clubs and associations with principles that may directly       or indirectly promote the cause  of  revolution, and to try to       become members  of  the  Congress and take  part in  its       activities  whenever  advisable, keeping in view  the rules of       the Association.   (5) That to provide wo2&apos;kers with work it is necessary to divide the       district activities into three channels          (a) village works ;         (b) secret works ;         (c) local  social  functions  and  activities connected  with             clubs and associations.   These papers  mentioned 2;5 districts in one area outside  thisProvince in which there are already district organisers at work and the member now under restraint  was on  his  way  to  strengthen  theorganisation in those districts.   To emphasise the  danger of the conspiracy let me refer for a mount to the question of arms.  I have seen it stated that therecan be no stock of arms because the police  in  making their arrestson 25th October did not come across them.  I should have been verymuch surprised  if the police had made any seizure of arms on  that occasion.  Even in the old  conspiracy, it was a cardinal principlethat the arms of  the revolutionary society should not be kept withthe leaders or those  promineut in  direct action,  but should bescattered among  those  whose- activities were thought not yet to besuspected  by the police.  I  was not in  India  at the time on 25thOctober but a perusal of  speeches  and the Idaily papers shows, Ithink, that  there was a very general idea that Government was about to take some action, and I think we may take it as perfectly certainthat the  terrorist party were well  aware of the rumours.  It  wasexceedingly unlikely that they would have left any arms in  anyplace which they thought  there was the remotest chance of tbe policesearching.  As  to the  existence of the arms  and bombs, we have,besides our secret information, the fact that  they  have been used on several occasions.  We know that  bombs  have  been prepared in Calcutta ;  six bombs and one unloaded shell were found at the WardInstitution, Manicktala, but our investigations showed that many more shells had been made, and a  recent case in Faridpore underthe Explosives Act  shows that the preparation was not confined toCalcutta ;  we know that  individual  weapons  and small parcels of weapons have been smuggled through the  customs  in considerable
numbers ; 34 revolvers and automatic pistols have been recovered bythe police in Calcutta during the year ; of these 17 were captured inattempts at smuggling.  But dangerous as past experience has shownthese comparatively small number of weapons to be in the hands ofmen of this  type, an even greater danger would be the possession bythese men of a large store of firearms sufficient to encourage themadness of open revolution and anarchy.  We know that during thelast war the revolutionary party made desperate efforts, with Germanhelp, to get  a cargo  of arms landed in  India ;  they failed, but during the past year at least  three more attempts have been made.Unfortunately, in post-war conditions it is far easier than  before toobtain firearms, and there are adventurers in most countries who are willing to provide  firearms to anyone who  can pay the  price and arrange for the receipt.  We know that there is one organisation  inGermany and  another under  a well-known leader in the  Far east which have for some time been  endeavouring to get consignments of arms into  India.  Members  of the Council may recollect that within  the last year  there  have been accounts  of  a considerablenumber of seizures of arms on ships  at Durban, Colombo, Shanghai,Singapore and other places.  We have reliable information confirmedfrom sources with which the Bengal  Police have  nothing whateverto do, that the ultimate  destination  of at least two of the cargoesseized was in India.   I will not  further  labour the point of  the  existence of the terrorist conspiracy ; it  has been admitted by those who have beenloudest in denouncing our attempts to deal with it.  I do not proposeto repeat here what has been said elsewhere of the evils of terrorism,the dangers of its growth and the insidious nature of its spreadinginto all walks of public or even  private life.   I think the council will  agree that the  unrestricted  growth  of a  terrorist  group is incompatible with the existence of any government, whether Swarajor not.  The evil, therefore, has to be tackled and  I  know of only two ways of  doing it.  The first, which is one that has been strongly pressed on us in the Press and in speeches, is the punitive line ;  to simplify criminal  procedure and to rely on the punishment in theCourts of those who commit offences.  We have  tried this duringmany  years  in  the past;   many  cases  broke  down through  the impossibility of getting  our witnesses into Court, through intimidation-dation,  through the  murder of  witnesses, approvers and  police officers, but  it is true, and this is the fact that is  made much of by those who press this course on us, that in. a certain number of caseswe did obtain convictions.  But the cardinal fact is that the  terroristsemerged from these often very lengthy trials stronger  than  at  thebeginning, while  the forces  of Government were weaker; 1 have previously  quoted in  this  Council the  testimony of the  revo-lutionaries  to  this fact,  and  I may perhaps  quote it  again  :&quot; Government  realised  that  very little  harm  was done to  therevolution.  A few persons  were punished but the revolutionary movement went on as usual in the  country.&quot;  This fact  has been emphasised  by the Bengal Government in all the  correspondencethat led up after many years to the Defence of India rules.  Lastly,I may quote the conclusions of the Rowlatt Committee : &quot; We maysay  at  once that we do not expect  very much from  punitivemeasures.  The conviction  of offenders will  never ciieck such  a movement as that which grew up in Bengal, unless all leaders canbe convicted at the outset.   Further, tho real difficulties have beenthe scarcity of evidence due to various causes and the want of
reliance, whether  justified or not, on such  evidence  as  there hasbeen.  The last difficulty is fundamental and cannot be remedied.No law can direct  a Court to be convinced when it is not.&quot;   Thesecond alternative  is the one  we propose to  take, viz., to meet thedanger not by punitive but by preventive measures ;  it has alwaysbeen and will continue to be our policy to place before  the Courtsall cases of  offences against the ordinary  law where  we can do so without endangering our system of intelligence, but the essence ofthis method is to acquire information as to the terrorist organisationand the doings of  its members, and  to take  preventive action  only when it is necessary to  prevent crime  or paralyse  the  activities ofthe conspiracy.  In this, two things are of  the highest importance ;first, that the organisation shall not know the extent of  our know-ledge ;  we know  from past experience that their uncertainty  onthis point has a very crippling  effect; second, that our methods ofworking and our sources of information  shall  not,  directly  or indirectly, be divulged or endangered ; any rashness or carelessnesson this point will deprive us of all  information in the  future.  it follows from these  two essentials that we cannot take the publicinto our confidence ; but we can  point to  the past, to the  RowlattCommittee&apos;s  Report,  to  that  of  Mr.  Justice  Beachcroft  andMr. Justice  Chandravarkar;  the  whole of  the  workings of our intelligence  system were  laid bare before  the  gentlemen, almostentirely judicial,  who  composed these committees, and  we areprepared  to  stand by their  verdict.  Let me quote the verdict ofMr. Justices Beachcroft and Chandravarkar : &quot; The total  number ofcases advised on by its is 806.  In six of the total number  of  casesexamined by us we have advised Government  that there are not sufficient grounds, in our opinion, for believing that  the parties concerned have acted in a manner prejudicial to the public safety orthe defence  of  British India,  and  that, therefore, they should beunconditionally released.  In the rest we  have advised that theparties  have, in our opinion,  so  acted.&quot;  The two  Judges beforewhom the cases of the persons arrested under the Ordinance havebeen placed, have in every case agreed with  the opinion of Govern-ment that there are reasonable  grounds for beliei.  I should like to mention specifically three cases which have  been used in the  press to throw doubts on the efficiency, if not  on the bona fides, of  ourmethods of  working. The first two are those of Babu Aswini KumarDutt and Babu  Krishna Kumar Mitra ;  it has been said that no onewill believe that  they had anything to do with terrorist  crime andthat, therefore, the secret information  of the police must have beenfalse, and Government may  equally well be deceived  by such false information now.   I never knew  Babu Aswini Kumar Dutt,  but I hope that Babu Krishna Kumar Mitra will not be ashamed  if  I call him my friend, and I wholeheartedly acquit him of sympathy with terrorist crime.  But as far as I know  no one has ever accused him or Babu Aswini Kumar Dutt of promoting crime, still less of taking part  in it.   The  Bengal Government asked  for the arrest,  under Regulation III, of Babu Krishna  Kumar Mitra in 1908  bt cause his violent boycott speeches and his activity in organising volunteers involved t he danger of internal commotkm.  In  the tame way the Eastern Bengal corporation eminent asked for the use of  Regulation III, in the case of Babu Aswini Kumar Dutt, because of his whirlwind campaign  of anti-Government  speeches and of his control  of the Braja Mohan Institution,from which a stream of seditious preachus was constantly pouring.  In both these cases the activities for which
these gentlemen were restrained were open and  public ;  there  wasno need of secret police information and there was none ;  there  wasno  question  of Government  being  deceived or of  police infor-mation being false, and the argument that it is sought to found onthese two cases falls to the ground.  The  third case is founded on areport of  a statement  in Parliament by Mr. Scurr, that he &quot; under-stood that the only charge against the Chief Executive Officer of theCalcutta Corporation was that he had attended a meeting at which therewas talk of criminal conspiracy.&quot;  It would be interesting to knowwho supplied this information  to  Mr. Scurr and   what was theparticular meeting he  referred to ;   but  after the repeated decla-rations of Government it ought  not  to  be  necessary  to inform theCouncil that  Mr. Scurr&apos;s information is entirely wrong, and  that ifthe information in the possession of  Government did not convince them that all the conditions necessary for action under the  Ordinancewere completely fulfilled  in  this case the gentleman in question would not remain  under restraint.    I will not  trouble  the Council  with  much  discussion  of the theory that our action  has been directed  not against the terroristconspiracy but  against a political party, the Swaraj  party,  because i think there are very few persons who really&apos; hold that theory.  Itis said that 62  of  the  persons  arrested were Swarajists.   I have nopersonal  knowledge of the political  labels of any of these  personsexcept three, but  I do know that out of 111 persons now underrestraint 69 have either been convicted of political  crime  or  been previously restrained  for  personal  participation in  revolutionaryactivities ; these persons at all events were revolutionaries before they were Swarajists.  I would remind the Council that on the 20thAugust 1923, when warning the House of  the imminent  danger ofthe revival of terrorism, I  said : &quot; If this danger is to be met, itmust be met  with  the  support  of this Council and I  feel confident that Government can  count on the support of this Council,  on thesupport of all parents in Bengal, and of all true  lovers of Bengal inevery  endeavour  we  have to make to stamp  out  this  insidiousconspiracy.&quot;   At that time  there was no political  Swaraj party.  Onthe 25th January 1924, within a month of the leader of the  Swarajparty being offered office by His Excellency,  I said in this Council  :&quot; We cannot divest ourselves of the responsibility, and as  long as there are  powers at our hand which mayr  bo sufficient to enable usto deal with the  situation it is undoubtedly our duty to use them. if those powers are not sufficient then we shall come to the Council and ask for further powers, and the Council may prefer to give us those powers in another form, but the power to be given must be efficient.I am optimistic  enough to believe that should the occasion arise theCouncil will give us  those powers  because the alternative is thetriumph  of anarchy and murder.&quot;  After these  clear warnings ofthe measures that it  would probably be  necessary to take to  dealwith  the  terrorist menace, warnings uttered at a time  when theSwaraj party either did not  exist in  this Council or  had just been offered responsible office in the Government, when we do take themeasures foreshadowed against the terrorist organisation the publicare asked  to  believe--firstly, that we  are fools enough to desire tocrush  any  political  party  acting  legally  and  constitutionally ;secondly, that we had  the  prescience to lay  our  plans over  a  yearago ; and  thirdly,  that we are so stupidly inefficient in our measuresto that end that  the chief comment on  our action was not that we     104                                                  JD
2dhave  harmed  the Swaraj party, but  that we  have given it a newlease of life.   I am aware that it has been urged that there is a third methodopen to us of dealing with  the terrorist menace, viz, the  prescription-tion  put forward by those leaders who agree with our diagnosis ofthe disease.   That, is the  establishment  of  Swaraj or provincial autonomy  or  some further advance on the  road thereto.  It is claimed that  this will produce an atmosphere in which terrorismcannot flourish.  Now, Sir,  I entirely deny that this is  a method ofdealing with a terrorist  conspiracy at all.   I  regard  this terrorismconspiracy as a thing entirely apart by itself, a danger that  must be faced and got rid of  because of its own intrinsic evil ; it is on aseparate plane entirely  from anything  like  constitutional politics.If political parties wish to go on pressing for constitutional  changes,for what each of  them means by  Swaraj, by all  means let them doso : no measure that we  are asking the Council to pass will  interferewith  that  in  any way ;  we  are pledged to  a goal and we have no intention  of letting terrorism interfere with  our  advance to  thatgoal.   But to  link terrorism to  political changes  is  not to destroyterrorism  but to  encourage  it.  I have reason to  believe  that theopinion is prevalent with very many people that although  violence and terrorism will never bring a nation  political freedom  they  arenot bad instruments with which  to weaken a government;  in thewords of a leading article in an Indian paper recently, they are the&quot;sappers  and miners of the constitutional advance,&quot; and it  is claimed that their use is  always followed by an advance.  That, Sir,I think is a misreading of the facts and  is based on a  profoundmisunderstanding  of psychology.  To  my mind it is a conceptionthat is fatal to  the future of Swaraj ; to identify  political  progress with political blackmail  is to poison the springs of future political life.  If the atmosphere can be improved,  if the clouds of distrustand  racial hatred  can be blown  away, by all means let   us all do what  we can towards it.   But terrorism  can have  no part  in this;it is a  stumbling  block in  all the  paths  that lead  towards our common goal.   It is on the basis that there exists a terrorist  conspiracy and thatit is Governments first duty to grapple with it that I bring forwardthis Bill.   I have given the reasons why Government and here Ispeak for all my colleagues, Indian and Europiean alike consider th&amp;there is no alternative method of  grappling with it, and I  shall ask the Council not to take the responsibility of refusing to give us thepowers Avhich, with a full  sense  of our own responsibility in  thematter, we are convinced are absolutely necessary to  enable us toremove the common menace.    Mr. PRESIDENT; Order, order.  The House will  now adjournfor .10 minutes.  When  the Council reassembles,  I  shall put  thomotion that leave be given to introduce  the Bill and if there is any opposition I will  under Rule 50 accept only one speech in opposition and thereafter I shall, without further debate, put the question.  TheHouse will now adjourn for  10 minutes.    The Council  was then adjourned.    [After the adjournment.]    Sir P. C. MlTTER :  As a signatory to the Rowlatt Report,  it ismy painful duty  to oppose this motion  and I must naturally standby the  recommendations of that  report.  The present Bill departs
from the recommendations of the Rowlatt  Report in almost everyimportant question of principle  and proceeds on tho Defence  ofIndia Act.   The  Rowlatt Committee  had before it the Defenceof India Act, which  was a  war measure;  it accepted some  of  itsprinciples but did  not accept others, and laid  down new principlesof  its own principles  which  my  honourable  friend  Sir  HughStephenson  is aware  of.  Sir,  I  intend to be very  brief.  I maypoint out  to the  Council  that  these  principles are set forth  at  iges 206 and 207  of  the Government publication.  However  much the  public may criticise  the Rowlatt  Report, Government, in  myopinion,  has  no justification whatsoever to  go  back upon the recom-mendations of the  Rowlatt Report.   As the only non-official Indianwho was privileged to examine the inner workings of the revolu-tionary  movement, I claim I have some  right  to speak on thissubject.  I may begin by saying  that  I believe that there is  at thepresent moment a  revolutionary  movement.  I believe also and Ihave always  held the opinion,  and  I am  still of tbe same mind that,  apart from other  considerations,  in  the interest of the very important question of our national  asph-ations this revolutionary movement  must be  checked : but  I am sorry to say, Sir, that theBill proposes  not a physician&apos;s treatment of the malady but a quack&apos;sremedy.  I  think  that  if the  Bill  be  certified  or passed by  thelegislative Council,   it  will  not only  fail in its object  but willperhaps  be,  although it is  farthest  from the  intentions of  themembers of  the Government, a helpful measure  towards the pro-pagation of the revolution iry movement.  In view of the  dangerousnature of the movement, I  do not like to further elaborate myreasons publicly on this point.   This  being my view, I have, aftermature, consideration, come to the  conclusion  that  in   the  veryinterest of the object  Government have in  view and  out of loyalty to the Committee on which I had  the privilege  to  serve, I  mustoppose this Bill.   But I  want to be helpful towards the Governmentand the public and I  would suggest very shortly certain constructive proposals.  My suggestion to the Government and the public is andI am ouly  repeating here  certain  amendments  which  had beendisallowed by you, Sir that Government should re-tnact Part I ofthe Rowlatt Act.  This should be done  as a temporary measure andthe Act should remain in force for three years.   Mr. E. VILLIERS :  May I rise  to  a point ol order ?  Is the hon.member in order in moving amendments while opposing the Bill ?   Mr. PRESIDENT : Sir Provash is quite in order.   The amendments to which he  alludes  were  disallowed as being  irrelevant to theprovisions of the  Bill.   He  is now putting them forward as oon-structive  proposals  in  explanation, I understand, of  his  determination to vote against the  motion ; in other words, it is an alternative to theBill  which he proposes, and he is perfectly entitled to  do so.   Sir P. C.  MITTER :  The  Act should remain iu force  for  threeyears the  life of  the Rowlatt Act.   If the  Government feel tooapprehensive it may  even re-enact some portions  of Part II, but itwould be against the recommendations of the Rowlatt Committee  tore-enact Part III of the Act  on the  case made out by Government.I would, however, point out  that  even the re-enactment of thewhole of  the Rowlatt Act is quite a different proposition from thepassing of the present  Bill; 1 hope it will not be too late for theGovernment  to accept this humble suggestion of mine,
   I may mention, Sir, that in putting forward these views I do notprofess to represent my party opinion.   The opinion of. Liberals in bengal has been embodied in the letters of the Indian association and  that of the  All-India  Liberals in the resolution of  the LiberalFederation.  My  opinion differs from my Liberal friends, as it  isbased on knowledge which they do not possess.   It also differs from government opinion, as my association  with  political  movements and  political  activities of  the last 30 years gives me an insight into an aspect of the  question which is not available  to  any  members ofthe Government, British or Indian.   I trust the Government and  the public  will  not misunderstandme.   I have no right to arrogate, and indeed I do not  arrogate, thatthe Government and the public in holding their opposing views are necessarily wrong.   As a public man,  I consider I  am not onlyjustified in placing my views before them, but I should have beenfailing in my duty if I shirked doing so.     The  motion that leave be given to introduce the  Bill was thenput, and a division taken with the following result :                          AyesAddams-Williams, Mr. O.Addy, Babu Amulya Dhone.Ali, Mr. Altai&apos;.Baud.

(Sd.)     HEADING,   2&apos;2nd January 1.925.              Viceroy ami Governor-General.                        ENCLOSURE No. 5.                            STATEMENT.   1. It is a  matter of  common knowledge that a  revolutionaryconspiracy existed during the years 1912-17, which has left the mostpoignant  memories of the misery and terror it created  throughoutBengal.  AH other methods of  dealing with  this conspiracy having
been tried without avail, it was not suppressed until its leaders were confined under the provisions of Regulation III of 1818, and manyof its subordinate members dealt with under the Defence of india act.  After the Royal  Proclamation of 1919, most of  these persons were released.  Many  forsook their connection with  revolutionarycrime and have  not since  returned  to it.  To the remainder whohave since showed themselves to be irreconcilable, the amnesty was,after  the  institution  of  the  reformed  system  of  government.gradually extended, in the hope  that under  a  new political era theywould  recognise  the duties  and the advantages of  good  citizenship.This hope has not been realised.  The majority of these still retainedtheir faith in the efficacy of violence and  assassination  as politicalweapons.   They speedily  returned to  their old  methods  andreorganised  their old  associations, taking care only  to avoid  themistakes to which  they attributed their  previous failure.  Duringthe years 1920 to 1922  they carried on  their activities under thecloak of  the political movements then in progress, recruiting their followers and perfecting their  organisation with  a view  to future action when opportunity offered.   2. Towards the  end  of  1922 the leaders of these conspiracies,believing that their objects would  not be attained by the methods ofthe non-co-operation movement,  decided  to revert to methods of violence.   The  two main  terrorist  organisations  had now  beenresuscitated ; new members in large numbers were recruited ; armsand  ammunition, partly  of a kind which cannot be obtained inIndia, and  must  therefore have been smuggled from abroad, were collected ;  a new and highly dangerous  type of  bomb  was manu-factured ; and projects of  assassination against certain police officersand other persons were devised.  The movements  of  these officersand their residences were  watched, and  those who watched, beingthemselves placed under observation, were traced to  places knownto be haunts of the conspirators.   3. During the year 1923, a  series of outrages was  perpetrated,including a dacoity with double murder at Kona,  near Howrah, andthe looting of  the  Ultadingi  Post Office  in  May, a  robbery withmurder in July, the Sankaritolla murder  and others which  I neednot specify.   In January of the  present year Mr. Day was murderedin Calcutta and an attempt was made to murder Mr. Bruce in April,in both  cases, as it appears, in mistake for  a prominent and  dis-distinguished police official.  In March a bomb factory was discovered,and other activities directed to the manufacture  of bombs and theillicit collection  of  arms were  detected.   It is known that othercrimes were  planned,  and that  projects of assassination continued and still continue to be devised.  I say nothing of other deplorableevents which are now under judicial investigation.  Evidence hasbeen placed  before  me  which  shows to  my satisfaction that themovement is deepseated and dangerous.   It is impossible for obvious reasons to divulge much of the information available to Government,but it  confirms  in every respect  the view I have been  forced toaccept.   4. Though the situation  during 1923 was grave, I was reluctant to invoke the powers conferred upon me by the Government of india act until I was fully persuaded  that ail other means for dealing withthe emergency had been exhausted.  My Government  accordinglyauthorised the confinement  of  certain  leaders  of  the criminalassociations under  the provisions of Regulation  III of 1818.  The
2Dmovement was  temporarily  checked,  hut new leaders were  foundand operations were resumed, as is apparent from the dark record of crime in the present year.   I have therefore come to the conclusion,after the  fullest consultation with the local Government, that  it isnecessary to arm the Government of Bengal with  special powers todeal with preparations  for  crime, with the object of protecting notonly the  officers  of Government,  whose lives are threatened, butequally private  citizens, who  have  frequently been the innocentsufferers from such outrages, and the misguided youths who are itstools  and  often  themselves its victims,   f  am convinced that  jire-reparations and plans for criminal  outrages are now so dangerouslydeveloped that it is necessary to provide immediate safeguards byan Ordinance.  Permanent measures to remedy the situation will.intine course be presented by the local Government.   5.  The Ordinance is directed solely to these  ends and will in no way touch or affect the interests or liberties of any citizens, whetherengaged in private or public affairs, so long  as they do  not connectthemselves with violent criminal methods.   The fundamental dutyof Government is to preserve  public security  on  which  politicaladvance and all  the functions of a civilised  social organism depend.And,   as  it  is  manifest  that sound  and   permanent  politicalprogress cannot  be accelerated by violence or threat of violence, soalso I deem it my duty and the duty of my Government to see thatno violence  or threat of violence shall operate to retard it.  I and my Government will therefore proceed as we are doing  along theline of political development laid down in the declared policy ofParliament reaffirmed by His  Majestjr&apos;s Government.  Acting withthese  objects and these intentions, I  believe myself and my Govern-rneht to  be entitled to the support  and co-operation of all thosewdio have truly at heart the peace, the prosperity and the politicalfuture of India.

EAST  INDIA  (CRIME).DESPATCH  FROM  THE  GOVERNOR-GENERAL  TO  THE    SECRETARY   OF  STATE  FOR   INDIA,  DATED  2ND    APRIL 1925.The Bengal Criminal Laiv Amendment (Supplementary) Act, 1925.      I have the honour to forward herewith an authentic copy ofthe Act noted above, to which I have  signified  my  assent under clause (b) of subsection (1)  of  section 67B  of  the  Government ofIndia Act.  A motion was made in the Legislative Assembly onMonday, 23rd March, for leave to introduce a Bill to  supplement the bengal  Criminal  Law Amendment  Act,  1925, and leave havingbeen granted, the Bill, of  which  I  enclose a copy,  was introducedforthwith.   On the  same day a motion that  the Bill be taken intoconsideration was passed, but during the detailed consideration ofthe Bill clauses 4, 5 and 6, which constituted  the  main operativeclauses of the Bill, were struck out.  If the Bill had been passedwith the omiss:on of tin se clauses, the objects for which  it was intended to be enacted  could not have been secured ; and as on the expiry of  tbe Bengal Criminal 1 aw Amendment Ordinance, 1924, itwas essential that such of the powers  conferred by  that Ordinancewhich could not be enacted in the  Bengal Criminal Law amendment act, 1925, should  be retained, I put  into use tbe power of recom-mendation contemplated by section 67B of the Government of  india act, and recommended to the Legislative Assembly that  it shouldpass the Bill in the form in which it was introduced.  To bring tbeBill  into  conformitv with the form recommended  by  me,  the member of Government in  charge  of the Bill on 24ih March movedan amendment by which it was sought to  restore clauses 4, 5 and 6to the Bill.  This  amendment was rejected by 72 votes  to 4.1 votes,and in rejecting the amendment the LegL-lative Assembly fai ed topass the Bill in the form recommended by me, and  a  certificate  tothat effect was thereupon  given by the President  on the request ofthe Member of Government in charge of the Bill.  Being of opinionthat  the passage of the Bill  in its entirety  was essential for  thetranquillity of  the Presidency of Bengal, I gave a certificate to that effect in exercise of my powers under section 67n. and recommended to the Council  of  State that it should  pass  the Bill  in the form inwhich I had recommended it  to the Legislative Assembly.  In -theCouncil of  State  on 26th March a motion was made that  the Bill, inthe form  recommended by the  Governor-General, be  taken  intoconsideration.  This  motion was passed by 29 votes to 3 votes, and thereafter the  Bill was passed  without  any  further division.  On30th  March I signified my assent  to  the Bill, and below  thatendorsement I placed the further endorsement  required by  theopening words of subsection (2) of section 67B.  Having regard tothe fact that the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1924,expires on 25th April 1925, and time does not, allow of the Bill being submitted for His Majesty&apos;s assent, in accordance with the proce lurelaid down  in subsection (2) of section 67B, I have made  a  directionunder the proviso to that subsection.   2.

(Sd.)    READING,  23rd March 1925.              Viceroy and Governor-General.    [The Bill is identical with that shown in Enclosure No. 1.]         STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS.   His Excellency the Governor-General published in a Gazette Extra-ordinary of the 25th October 1924, a statement of the reasons whichmoved him, in  exercise of the  powers conferred upon  him  bysection 72 of the Government of  india Act, to make and promulgatean Ordinance  to  supplement the ordinary criminal law in Bengalunder the title of the  Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance,1924  (I  of  1924).  Under  the  provisions of section  72E of theGovernment of India Act, an Act has been made under the title ofthe Bengal Criminal  Law Amendment Act, 1925, which has for its object the continuance by a local enactment of the provisions of the bengal  Criminal  Law Amendment Ordinance,  1924  (I  of 1924).This Act was reserved for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasureand the assent of His Majesty in  Council thereto has been signified.   2.  Certain of the provisions of the Bengal Criminal Law Amend-ment Ordinance, 1924 (I of 1924), being beyond the competence ofthe local Legislature, have not  been included in the local Act above mentioned, and the object of the present Bill is to supplement.thelocal Act in this respect.   3.  The principal provision of the Bill  is contained  in  clause 3,which provides for au  appeal  to  the High Court  by any personconvicted on a trial held by Commissioners under the local Act, andfor the submission  to  the  High  Court  for confirmation of anysentence of death passed by the Commissioners.   4.  Clause 4  empowers the local Government, with the previoussanction of  the Governor-General in Council, to  make  an  order
committing  to custody, in  a jail  outside Bengal  any person against whom  an order under section  11  (1) (/) of the local Act may bemade.   5. Clause 6, on  the  analogy  of  sestion 491 (3) of the criminal procedure Code, bars jurisdiction  under the powers conferred bythat section.                                          A. P. MUDDIMAN.  18th  March 1925.                       ENCLOSURE No. 4.   The  Assembly has failed  to  pass  the  Bill  to supplement the bengal Criminal  Law  Amendment Act, 1924, in the form recom-mended by the Governor-General.                                 (Sd.)    A. F. WHYTE,   24th March 1925.                                 President.                       ENCLOSURE NO.  7.A  STATEMENT by His Excellenej&apos; the  Governor-General of  the    reasons which have moved him, in exercise of the powers con-    ferred upon him by section 67B of the Government of India Act,    to pass an order for the  certification  of  the Bill to supplement    the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1925.   1. When, on the 25th October 1924, I made  and promulgated anOrdinance to supplement the ordinary Criminal Law in Bengal, Ipublished a statement recording  in a concise form the circumstances which, in  my judgment, rendered this measure indispensable.  Ido not consider it necessary to recapitulate or amplify that statementfurther than to say that the grave recrudescence  of  anarchical andterrorist crime in Bengal and the organisation of conspiracies to thisend can no longer be matter of controversy.   2. I intimated at the same time that  measures of  a more per-manent  character would  in due  course   be  presented  by  theGovernment of Bengal in  the local Legislature.  In pursuance ofthis intimation a Bill  was  introduced in  the Bengal LegislativeCouncil, the object of  which was to continue the provisions of  the ordinance for  a period  of  five  years.  This Bill, having  been enacted under the provisions of section 72E of the  Government ofIndia Act, has received the assent of His Majesty in Council.   3. Certain  of  the  provisions of  the Ordinance were,-however,beyond the competence of  the local Legislature, partly  as  affectingthe jurisdiction of the High  Court of Judicature at Fort William in bengal  and partly  as  operating, in one particular  and in certaincontingencies,  beyond  the territorial limits  of  the  Presidency of bengal.  The object  of the present Bill is to supplement the  localAct in these respects.   4. The provisions for an appeal to the High Court by any personconvicted on a trial held by Commissioners under the local Act andfor the submission  to the  High Court of any sentence  of deathpassed by the Commissioners constitute in my opinion importantsafeguards for  the  just and equitable  operation  of   the  special procedure instituted by this Act.   Circumstances may arise in whichit will be desirable that persons committed to custody in jail under
section 11  of the local  Act should be, for such  time as  may beneedful,  removed from the environment in which  their presence:might  be a source  of  danger to the public security.  This is  a precaution which I consider necessary.  I also consider it indispensable-sable, in  order that the preventive and precautionary powers vestedby the Act in the Executive  Government maybe made effective,that orders of arrest or of committal to or detention in  custodyshould not be  subject to  directions under section 491 of the code of Criminal Procedure, 1898.  Moreover,  if  proceedings  of  this character were taken,  Government might  be  obliged  to revealinformation of the  most  dangerous character and to compromiseand render powerless their measures of precaution  and intelligencewhich constitute, in  dealing with secret conspiracies, one of themost important practical safeguards of public security.  This would clearly frustrate some of the most essential purposes of the Act.   5.  For these  reasons I have decided and certified that  this Billis essential for the tranquillity of the Presidency of Bengal.   6.  Inasmuch as the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance,1924, expires on the 25th April 1925, and time does not allow of theBill being submitted for His Majesty&apos;s assent in accordance withthe procedure laid  down in subsection (2) of  section 67B of theGovernment of India Act,  I have made a direction that the Act shall come into operation forthwith.                                         READING,                                 Viceroy and Governor-General.   30th March 1925.                           No.  2.
