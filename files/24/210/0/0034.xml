noCUMEafig,18 THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITANNIC  MftJ08TY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Copy No. 4 084(30jCABINET.TRADE OUTLOOK.Memorandum by the Presldr-nt of the Board of Trade.I circulate for the information of the Cabinet the minutesof the meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council dealing withthe state of trade in February.          The views expressed in the reports communicated on     this occasion were on the whole distinctly pessimistic.     To begin with the coal trade,  though 1929 was on the     whole a good year and the mines were well employed during     January, 1930, the trade now had to face the consequences     of a phenomenally mild winter In North Europe.  The falling     off in the volume of shipping was contributing to the     depression.          The depression in the shipping trade where most     shipowners, it was stated, were making dead losses on     their sailings, was attributed to several causes, special     mention being made of the difficulties experienced in the     Australian trade where the new tariff had at any rate     temporarily hit outward shipments very hard, and the     cessation of emigration had deprived of their only business     the ships specially built for the traffic.  The Australian     representative explained that the fall in the price of wool     had created considerable difficulties for Australian commerce     and that the tariff increases had been prompted by the need     of increased revenue rather than by a desire to exclude     British goods.  As regards emigration, he stated that there     was increased unemployment in Australia and that a return of     prosperity to that country was the only hope of a resumption     in the flow of emigration.
     The iron and steel trade was unsatisfactory, there beinglittle forward business, and in engineering the only brightspots were In the electrical and marine sections.  There was anapplication for increased wages in the engineering trade whichhad been rejected by the employers but was due for furtherconsideration by joint conference this month.     The cotton reports were gloomy, not enough orders coming in to keep half the plant running.  The fall in the price ofthe raw material was having the effect of making buyers holdoff in the fear of further falls.  This was also the case withwoollens where, though the result of the reference to the Courtof Enquiry of the dispute in this trade had been beneficial,there was much unemployment, the proportion reaching as high as 28/&apos;&apos; in some districts.  The opinion was expressed, however,that there was a good future ahead for wool as no propersubstitutes were available and it seemed that the bottom hadbeen reached in the price of the raw material.   Tha hosiery    \trade was more stagnant now than it had been for a long time,and uncertainty as to fiscal policy with particular referenceto the artificial silk duty was having an unfortunate effect.     Apprehension as to budget possibilities was of courseexpressed in other connections, such as in the motor industrywhere agents report hesitation on the part of potential customersdue to this feeling of uncertainty.     The chemical trade was generally doing well especially incertain heavy chemicals, and dye stuffs were now being exported from this country in increasing quantities.     AS regards the position of employment generally, owing tothe absence of the usual seasonal fall in the numbers ofunemployed in January this year the total for February 3rd washigh, 1,509,000, being only slightly below the peak just after christmas.  The trades most affected were cotton and wool.     In the money market there had developed a wide marginbetween official and open rates of discount which had been to
2ty s%some extent adjusted by the latest reduction in the bank rate.  The weakness of the Sterling Exchange on New Yorkwas due apparently to an abnormal tendency for balances todrift from London to flaw York, and this might be attributed to the attractive prices of American investments after therecent Wall Street collapse, and perhaps to some extent topessimism in this country.

          MEETING OF THE BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY&quot; COUNCIL               ON WEDNESDAY, 12th FEBRUARY, 1950.                                                                     j     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:   I must apologise, In thefirst place, for my absence from one or two of the recent meetingsof the Council, due to the great pressure of Parliamentary duties,and also I think on one occasion owing to the fact that I was outof the country on Government business.  Last time the meeting ofthe Council was cancelled, but I hope to be present at all orpractically all of the meetings in future.  In any case, I amgrateful to members for the reports which they lodged, particularly at the last meeting, and I know I can count on their continued co-operation.                              Coal.     MR. RIDLEY WARHAM:  With regard to the coal trade, the weekly output for the United Kingdom for the three weeks ending25th January was practically 5-J- million tone over each of thethree weeks, and the average of the eight weeks ending 25th Januarywas 5,133,000 tons as compared with 4,809,000 tons for thecorresponding period of the previous year.  This period of courseincludes the Christmas and New Year holidays.     The number of persons employed for the week ending 25thJanuary was 954,000, equal to SQ% of the 1913 figure.  Unemploy-ment for the month of December was 14.6^ compared with 14.3,^ inNovember and an average in 1928 of 21.9$.. .     The quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom was inDecember 4,804,000 tons, as compared with 5,197,000 tons inNovember last, but it was only 3,988,000 tons in December of theprevious year.     The average price per ton in December was 16/6 as comparedwith 16/5 in both November and October.     The exports by sea from Poland in ifovember and December were694,000 and 663,000 tons, showing increases of 37,000 and 94,000tone over the corresponding period last year-*  respectively -not quite as great as they were during the summer months, butthat may be accounted for by their inland trade.     In expectation of another period of severe weather buyersboth at home and abroad laid in heavy stocks of coal, but owingto the exceptionally mild winter - it is said to be themildest in Northern Europe for 15 0 years - stocks have been drawn upon only to a very email extent, and the result ie thatthere is a serious setback in the demand both inland and export, particularly the latter.  Prices have- eased considerably,and the outlook at present is far from favourable.   The freightmarket has also suffered a serious relapse, and shipping*But c.f. p.8.
generally is in a very depressed condition, which has afurther bearing upon the coal trade.  Owing to so manysteamers being laid up, we are feeling the want of orders forbunkers, etc.   Deep sea steamers seem to have felt it first,but it seems now to be affecting the coasting steamers, andcoasting freights have fallen in many oases right down tothe pro-war figures.  In the ordinary way this should help the coal trade by making c.i,f. prices easier, but at thepresent moment there seems to be practically no new orderscoming forward at all.  We are not able to take advantageof it,     There is one point that I would like to bring before you,and that is with regard to Spain,  In &apos;The Times&apos;  of 3rdFebruary it is stated that the new Spanish Government intends to review all decrees promulgated by the late Government.Some of these decrees, in so far as they affect the coal trade,are very drastic, and the present would appear an opportune moment for our Government to make an effort to secure some concessions.  The following figures show how the exports to spain have fallen off during the last few years.  In 1913 weexported 2-1 million tons there.  In 1927 it was 2,360.-000, in1928 1,867,000, and last year it was 1,782,000.  Cox-taiuindustries are allowed to import up to 20% of their require-ments, but others, such as gas works, are not allowed to have ,any foreign coal at all, being compelled to use Spanish only,and this, of course, at very high prices.  Before this edictwas passed, a firm of north country exporters exported from100,000 to 150,000 tons of gas coal to Barcelona per annum,and now their gas coal sales to Barcelona do not reach20,000 tons, the only buyers now being the glass works, the gas companies not being allowed to take it.  To take anotherinstance, the sugar works in Malaga used to buy 20?000 to30,000 tons of our coal at this time of the year, thequantity varying according to the sugar crop, but this yearthey could only obtain licences to import 10%, andconsequently we have only sold them one 1,700 ton cargo.  Theimport duty is 7-1 pesetas per ton, payable in gold, but I donot think that this is so important as it is to get thecancelment of the restrictions,  Spanish coals are so badand costly to work that our coal can pay the duty and stillcompete, and I am given to understand that Spanish consumersprefer British coal and would welcome a change which wouldenable them to obtain the coal they require, and even paythe extra cost.  With the formation of the new Government,which has I believe more moderate views, there may be apossibility, if our Government could see their way to actpromptly, to get some of these restrictions either entirelyremoved or at any rate modified to a certain extent.  Thatwould have a very important bearing upon the coal trade ifwe could do that.     I have prepared, as usual, a summary of the British coalIndustry in 1929,* but I will only point out one particularpoint in it.  The European production shows an increase of7i% last year over 1928.  The share of Great Britain in the-xSee Appendix p 28,
total production of 713 million tons increased by approxi-mately 19fc million tons, Germany 15 million, Poland5 million.  But the comparison with the year 1913 shows in a striking manner the lost ground which Great Britain has still to make good in contrast to other producing countries inEurope.  The British output was no less than 31 millionbelow the 1913 level ,  but Germany shows an increase of50 million tons, France 10, and the Netherlands 9-g millions,and so on, which shows that we are far from maintaining our  ,relative production among the coalfields of Europe^.     Our Scandinavian trade has fallen off enormously owingto the Polish competition.  We have reduced our quantitiesby 4 million tons a year as compared with 1913, whereasPoland is shipping now at the rate of between 6 and 7 million tons a year.     PRESIDENT:  I am very greatly indebted to i.ir. RidleyWarham, especially at a time when the subject Is one of suchpublic controversy.   &apos;/hat is your view about the immediatefuture of the average price ?     Mrc RIDLEY WARHAM:  A certain number of contracts havebeen made ahead at good prices for this year, but  unfortunatelyowing to  the threat  of  a marketing  scheme,  a lot of our foreign buyers, some of whom came over to buy in the backend of last year, when they heard there was likely to be  a subsidy on exports preferred to wait,  and then  the wintercame on with enormous  stocks still  out there, and  they arenot buying at  all.   The result  is that the  colliery booksare not as full by any means as they would  like to see them at this time of the  year.  They are much like they were in1928 and  at the beginning of 19 29.  So that I  am ratherafraid that there will be a set back in prices  for some time.     Speaking  generally, the coal trade In  this country isthroughout pretty much  in the  same  position, both  the  inlandand exporting  districts, they  are  all  finding that there  is aslackening off  in the  demand,  and the  price has  already begun  to ease down.  I  am  afraid, in the meantime, unless  something  happensto give us an  extra  fillip, we  are  in  for rather worse times ahead.    PRESIDENT:  Could you add  anything about the  Scandinavianmarket?   I gathered  that you had  improved your  position vis a  visPolish competition within recent  times?     MR.  RIDLEY WARHAtlJ  It is  not  so  much that we have taken  it from Poland, but  there has been an increased demand  in each ofthese  countries.  Each of these  countries has taken  in rather  more coal than it did  in  the previous  year,  and  we have got that extratrade  which Poland  could not take.  Our  increase has  really come about  through  the  gradual  expansion of demand,  partly going into stock  and partly  for consumption,  throughout Europe.   That  is  where we have  got the extra trade from,  7e have  not taken  the trade from Poland because  Poland is  still  shipping to the  top of  herfacilities,  except in December when, probably  owing  to greaterinternal  demand,  she did not  ship  quite  so  much, by  about90,000  tons,  as compared with  the  average  shipments  for theprevious  six months**Cf however, figures on p.l.  Theof 19 29 were as follows:-               JSay - 769,000 tons              July - 763,000 tons              Sept.- 721,000 tonsgures for the earlier months  June 745,000 tons Augus t 758,000 tons   Oct.742,000 tons
     There is one other point that I might perhaps mention.  v/ithregard to reparations, taking Italy as an instance, - in 1915,out of a total consumption or import into Italy of 10 millionstons, this country sent 9-j? million tons.   Last year their consumption or Import was 14i millions, and this country only sentthem 7.   Whereas we sent 9 out of 10, this time we sent 7 out  of14,   Germany is sending 5 million.   We are hoping that^that willbe improved somewhat, but I see they took no less than 2t millions of free German coal, not reparation coal.     PRESIDENT:   That of course, as kr. Ridley Warham knows, I discussed at considerable length at the Hague.     MR. RIDLEY WARHAM:  And we are very much indebted to you for what you succeeded in doing there.     PRESIDENT:   I have only this regret that I wish it had beeneven larger.     MR, RIDLEY WAKHAM:  It is a very good thing to go on with,at any rate.    Naturally, one does not want to bring in politics, but we do feel that it is a matter for profound regret that when the coal mining industry seemed to be recovering alittle we should be threatened with legislation that looks 11&apos;: emaking our competitive power less than it was before.   That isthe thing which, as commercial people in the coal trade, we are most afraid of.     PRESIDENT:   I dare not embark upon that.   That is what Ihave been discussing since June with your colleagues amongstthe owners, as you know.Indian Trade.     MR. GUPTA:  There is nothing very much of importance toreport.   As regards December 1929, the imports of privatemerchandise were 17 crones A  3 lakhs of rupees as compared with18 crores 50 lakhs in December 1928.   Exports wore 24 crores10 lakhs as against 26 crores 95 lakhs in the same month of1928.     As regards details of imports for November 1929, as comparedwith November 1928, the value of food, drink and tobacco fell by25 lakhs., raw materials and articles mainly unmanufacturedincreased by 42 lakhs to 2 crores 22 lakhs, due chiefly to largerimports of kerosene oil.   Articles wholly or mainly manufacturedcame to 15 crores 14 lakhs,  making a decrease of 89 lakhs mainly due to smaller imports of iron and steel, machinery,1 cotton yarnand manufactures.The crore is  750,000;  the lakh  7,500.
     During the eight months ended November 1939 the valueof the imports decreased as compared with the correspondingperiod of 1988 by    crores, or 3%, and amounted to 165crores.     Imports under iron and steel progressively declined from 1 crore 93 lakhs in April to 1 crore 33 lakhs inSeptember.  But from October the import figures have actuallybegun to increase again, the figure for November going upto 1 crore 65 lakhs.  Imports under machinery and. mill workhave remained more or less steady, during the eight monthsApril to November, the imports in August being the highestfor the period.  Cotton piece goods started in April with an import figure of 5 crores 77 lakhs, but declined graduallyuntil August which recorded an improved figure of 4 crores59 lakhs, but the imports since August have againprogressively declined.     Certain crop forecasts have recently been issued.  Theonly point of interest at present is that the third cotton crop reported is an acreage of 25,536,000 acres, representing5,320,000 bales of 400 lbs. per bale.  The weather has been on the whole seasonable more or less throughout India, andthe condition and prospects of standing crops in the variousprovinces are on the whole fair to  good.  The bank rateremains unchanged at 7&apos;/.  The wholesale price index numberfor December 1939 is 134  - July 1914 being 100  - as comparedwith  137 for November  and 145 for  December 1938.  So that isa decline in the price index number by 11 points.                            Shipping.     HON. ALEXANDER SHA7:  I am.afraid that my report is of a rather gloomy kind for this month.  The index figure ofshipping freights for. January of this year has just been worked out and it shows a level of 16.4 per cent, below 1913.Taking 1913 as 100, the January 192Q level of shipping freightsis S3.59 as against last year when, compared with 1913, itwas 121.97.  That is a considerable drop below 1913 and avery large drop below the state of affairs last year.  Atthe same time the costs of cargo tonnage are about 60 percent.  greater than they were in 1913, and for passengerships the costs are considerably more than 60 per cent. -something like 100 per cent.  So it may fairly be said thatalmost nobody in the shipping industry just now is makinganything but dead loss on his sailings.  That has a reflectionin a serious increase in the laid up tonnage figures.  Thetonnage laid up on 1st October, 1939, was 306,000 tons.  Qn1st January, 1920, that figure had risen to 353,659 tons,since when there has been an unfortunate increase including anumber of new ships.     The tonnage under construction, however, on 31st December,which is the last quarter for which figures are available forthe United Kingdom, was 1,580,000 gross tons as compared withall other countries 1,550,000 tons making a total of 3,110,000.So that Great Britain again gets rather more than half of  thetonnage under construction.  The tonnage commenced in  the quarter ended 31st December, 1939, Great Britain and Ireland,was 499,000, and abroad 477,000 making a total of 976,000.The weight of coal exports from the United Kingdom for thewhole of 1939 was 60,266,000 tons as compared with the previous year of 50,000,000 tons - s. considerable&quot; increase.
     It Is very difficult to ascertain any particular factors to account for the unprecedented condition of shipping at thepresent time, but I would mention the general situation here,the unsettlement in China, and so far as one can single out anyrecent particular cause, the state of affairs in Australiawhere not only is the currency depressed, making it verydifficult to get back any credit balances thst lie in Australiasince what amounts to an embargo has been put upon the privateshipments of bullion, but the recent Australian tariffs have hadan instant effect.   Ships which sailed just after that tariff,sailed very largely empty.  Cargo did not come forward.  orders have been cancelled.  That state of depression which, of course,was most acute at first before people had become accustomed tothe new idea, still continues and the outlook in that particularis very serious indeed.   Coupled with that there is anotherAustralian factor which does affect a very large number of ships which were built in order to carry migrants from this country toAustralia.  That trade has been closed down.  These people are nolonger going.  One has the prospect of ships built to carry1,000 to 1,200 migrants going away practically empty and doomedfrom the moment they set sail to sustain a severe loss on the round voyage .     However, the general opinion of the shipowning communityseems to be th t these are temporary factors, that Australiawill recover her trade position and that it is impossible formany years to have an absolutely empty continent.  Theyaredemanding population for its development, and overflowingpopulation here demanding outlets;  so that the constructionof still further and more comfortable tonnage for the conveyance of migrants from this country to Australia has not been cancelledbut is going on.  Perhaps Mr. Sanderson might throw some furtherlight upon these two serious aspects, the outflow of migrantsfrom this country which has been checked, and the outflow of exports from this country to Australia which has been verylargely closed down for the time being.Australian Trade.     Mr. Sanderson:  Australia, like a good many other countriesso far as I can hear, is at the present time going through avery difficult period and her problems have been accentuated very considerably by the heavy fall in the price of wool.  Two and a quarter million bales have been received into store since 1st Julylast.  Their wool year is taken from 1st July to 30th June, andunder one million bales have been sold during the same period.There has been a joint conference of the Australian Wool Growers&apos;Council and the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers, whohave decided to extend the sales from 13th June to the middleof August.  Offerings are to be spread as equally as possibleover&apos; the intervening period and brokers ere to arrange withclients to ensure that prices will not be accepted below last weekslevels.   South Africa and New Zealand are to be invited to adopta similar policy.
     There is one bright spot and that is the break up of the drought in quite a considerable number of the districts whichhave been suffering for the last three or four years.   The non-soon rains have come in very acceptable quantities in Queenslandand Northern Territory and South Australia and Western Australia.The rest of the continent, while it has had some, does not usuallyexpect to get ordinary rains at this time of the year until about March or April.   It is hoped, therefore, that those will follow.   That means In effect that the expenses of keeping stockalive have been very much diminished and that pressure&apos; isrelieved.   AS regards wheat the Commonwealth exports this seasonprincipally  from Western Australia have been 10,107,000 bushelsmainly to the United Kingdom compared with 25,733,000 last season.The question of establishing a compulsory Commonwealth pool willbe discussed at the Conference of the Commonwealth Minister forMarkets and State Ministers of Agriculture on 13th February.The export of flour this season has been 70,500 tons, mainly to countries outside Europe as compared with 75,00 0 last season.     Finance is decidedly difficult at the present time.   Largeshipments of gold have been made and on the question of exchangethe Government have been in communication with the bankingrepresentatives.   It is impossible to say what will be done butI can only say that that matter when satisfactorily arranged willease the position considerably.   AS regards the coal industry that is still a difficulty owing to the prolongation of thestrike.   As regards the tariff and migration I cannot pretend togive you any particular information on those things, but I wouldlike to express some opinion formed from knowledge of what hasbeen going on.   In the first place this increase in the tariffis not solely due to what is regarded in many quarters here as aprotectionist movement for the exclusion of British merchandise.It Is to a certain extent at any rate,  caused by the necessity tohave increased revenue.   As regards the effect of those duties on shipments to Australia I think that must be inevitable in theperiod of economy and reduction of costs which so many Britishcritics have redommended to Australia for a long time past,There must be closer relation between exports and imports toprovide...for the surplus to enable the exchanges being put on a proper footings   Imports must be diminished and Exports mustbe increased and every effort is being made to do that.   If thepast history of Australia is taken into consideration I thinkit will be recognised she is at her best when really up againsta difficulty and that that is the time when new enterprises canbe encouraged and helped and increased production has takenplace.   In the period of the &apos;90&apos;s which was a very seriouscrisis in Australia, there was a very large increase ingoldmining production.   It Is not for me to say from whatdirection the relief will come but I have no doubt whatever that research is having its effect and the yield of primary industries will increase,   Y/ith regard to migration there again there area very great number of difficulties against which people havebeen struggling for the last ten years, and while it is admitted that there is a large country with a very small population inAustralia and a small country here with a large population thepassing of migrants from one place to the other is not an easything and everything must depend upon whether the conditionsin Australia are sufficiently good to retain the immigrants inAustralia.   Anything like a revival in the gold mining industry or any similar development in the past has shown that people
                          OOSFTDENTIALwould go to Australia to look for gold or if Australia was ina state of prosperity that enabled migrants to work profitablyand satisfactorily they would go there and In that case one would not hear the terrible tales that one does hear here fromtime to time from people who have returned after veryunfortunate experiences,     MR. SHAW:  I should,like to know if Mr.- Sanderson can tellus any particulars as to unemployment in Australia, if it is asbad there as in this country,     MR. SANDERSON:  I have not any figures, but there hasbeen a definite increase in unemployment and so far as one can see there is likely to be further unemployment.   It has been said that the imposition of these new tariff duties has created a demand for labour because of the increase in Industries, but unless this brings increased prosperity unemployment will go on increasing,   I have advice to the effect that Godfrey Phillips&apos;,the tobacco manufacturers, have decided to establish a factory at Melbourne with a capital of half a million pounds,   I do not know the extent to which that is true but this should giveemployment and will be a relief,     MR. HAMILTON:  I should like to ask Mr. Sanderson whether he thinks the full effect of the slump in wool has been feltor whether It will be a considerable period of time before that reduction is felt in the finances of Australia?     MR. SANDERSON:  I do not think myself it has been felt tothe full extent.   The immediate effect is that incomes havebeen diminished and therefore there is difficulty in arrangingfinance.   Either expenditure has to be reduced or there arisesthe necessity for interviews with bankers, but pressure isbeing exerted there,   I should not like to say this officially,but I would myself regard it as to some extent a misfortune ifthe price of wool was to be raised artificially,,   It is muchmore important to keep it as it is in order to reduce the costs of production.Coal.     Mil. MITCHELL:  In the coal trade there is very littledemand in the export trade owing to the continued mild weather and consequent heavy stocks in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and elsewhere.   There has been a considerable amount of lost time at the collieries especially on the rjast Coast.   There has beena fall in prices in some classes of coal.  The companies find itdifficult to get contracts taken up and the prospects generally are not good,   I might mention as a matter of Interest a remarkor two from a confidential letter fr&quot;om Germany,   It says thePolish collieries are after every piece of business they canpossibly touch.   They have taken bunker business for german ports at ridiculously low prices.   They have pushed the sale in italy, France and Holland at very keenly cut figures tryingtheir best to hold the price level in the Baltic,   Neverthelessprices are only nominal f,o,be Danzio.   There is a reference made to the Polish and German Commercial Treaty which is to be signed I understand very soon, but there Is an arrangement that
                         Iron and Steel.     As regards iron and steel, basic pig iron is still onoffer from India and additional sales have been made in Scotland.The imports in December were over 5,000 tons.   Foundry pig ironis coming Into Scotland from the Continent,   The imports ofsteel into Scotland from the Continent continue heavy.   Thedemand for steel Is weak and steel works are working undercapacity, although the position has been a little better for thelast fortnight,   William Beardmore &amp; Co. Limited have definitelyabandoned the malting of plates and sheets and have closed down their steel plant at Parkhead viorks.   They have also intimated that they do not propose to re-start their section and plateplant at Mossend.   The remaining works can easily deal withthe output discontinued at present but a considerable numberof men will be permanently thrown out of employment.   Theexport of scrap from the district is now small and imports are coming in from the Continent,   In December the imports intoScotland were 10,324 tons and the exports only 671 tons.The scrap position is distinctly better and prices are easier.In the tube trade there is a fair demand but the slackness inevidence at the end of 1929 continues in some classes of tubes,I would like to confirm what Mr. Shaw said about shipping.Shipowners in Scotland are complaining of low freights and want?of employment;  the tramp owners say the position has never beenworse.   Generally there is a pessimistic feeling in tradecircles.   The immediate prospects of production of most articlesare unsatisfactory.     THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:  I must mention tothe Council that we have a Cabinet meeting at eleven o&apos;clockand I am obliged to go now but I will ask Mr. Gillett of thisDepartment to take the Chair and he will invite questions onthe statements you have just heard.                         Colonial Trade.     MR. V3SNON (COLONIAL OFFICE),   On the whole the figuresfrom East Africa are good and from West Africa less good.Taking Uganda and Kenya together for the first t en months ofthe year thee export trade Increased from  5,800,000 in 1928 tothe imports will only begin three months after the signingwhich, would be at the nearest in May.   There is a certaindanger, they say, that after the. Polish coal begins to comeinto Southern Germany Silesian collieries iwy endeavour to export at Stettin to get rid of surplus German coal thuscreating new competition in the Baltic.   It is stated that-whatever low prices German Silesian collieries are going toaccept they will not be able to compete against Poland, butthey may get a certain part of the trade held by Yorkshire andthe Ruhr,   The report finishes by saying &apos;we think things lookblack for steam coal and nuts for the next six months whereascoke is fairly stead&quot;.
                          CONFIDENTIAL. 6,100,000 in 19290   There is a big increase in the export ofcotton from Uganda, 546,000 centals to 762,000 centals.  For thefirst nine months of last year the value of the Kenya and Ugandaimport trade was  5,800,000 as compared with  5,500,000 for thecorresponding period in 1928.   The percentage of imports fromthe United Kingdom is 38;?o which is slightly less than theprevious year0   Tanganyika territory shows a slight decrease inexport trade for ten months,  3,000,000 as against  3,100,000.There is an increase there in cotton from 62,000 centals to71,000 centals.   The total import trade for the first ten monthsshows a biggish increase from  3,100,000 to  3,600,000.   Thepercentage from the United Kingdom is 33;b as against 36/- in 1928.     Turning to the west Coast, the Gold Coast export trade forten months was  9,574,000 as against  10,082^000 in 1923,  Thedecline is mainly due to the fall in prices of cocoa.  The valueof the import trade in the first t en months is substancially lower,  7,525,000 as agdinst  9,256,000,   There is also a decreasein the percentage of imports from the United Kingdom during thisperiod falling from 53;s in 1928 and 47;* in 1929.   In Nigeria theexport trade for the whole of 1929 flhows an increase of  17,900,000as against  17,172,000,   On the other hand the import trade shows a rather substantial decrease  13,106,000 as compared with 16,534,000,  I have some rubber figures from Malaya.  In December1929 the exports were 48,000 tons against 45,000 tons the previous month and 86,000 in December 1923, which was the second month after the restriction had been removed0   The gross exports in1929 were 577,000 tons as compared with 403,000 tons in 1928,That was a total increase of 170,000 tons in the year.   Therewas again an increase in the output of tin and ore In the States,the figures being 62,000 tons in 1928 and 67,000 tons in 1929,     MR, GILLETT:  Is there any explanation for the large fall Inthose imports of the two Colonies?     MR, VERNON:  There is a big decrease in Nigeria.  I think thevalue of the figures in the import trade reflect bad prices in the exports from Nigeria the previous year, bad prices in oil productsgenerally,     MRo UAHHAM:  You said 33;^ from Great Britain,  Where is theother 67%     MR, VENNON:  The figures in Tanganyika territory I couldnot specify,  I have not the detailed figures before me, but myimpression is that there is a large competition now from Italyand Japan particularly in textiles.                             Cotton,                 The Industrial Position In China.     MR, LENNOX Li.CE:  I have a report on trade conditions and. i will hand it ln,*  I also have a short report on the industrial position in China If you would like to hear it.   It chieflySee Appendix, p. 41.   -  -10-
refers to cotton.  In 1914 the net total imp-orts (of all goods)into China were  78,000,000, in 1928 they were  179,000,000.  the exports in 1914 were  49,000,000 and the exports in 1928 were 149,000,000.   From the above figures It will be seen that in1928 the net imports end exports were respectively 229% and304% higher than in 1914 whilst the total trade shows an increase for the same period of 258;?&apos;.  In 1919 Chinese cotton millsnumbered 29 with 659,731 spindles and 2,650 looms,  whereas thecorresponding figures for 1929, after making allowance forobsolete machinery, were mills 72 spindles 2,059,088, looms 12,901.In other words between 1919 and 1929 the spindle-age of Chinese-owned mills had increased by 312% and the number of looms by486.5b, not to mention increases in the number of spindles andlooms which are owned by others than the Chinese.  In June 1929the Japanese owned nearly lj million spindles and 11,000 loomsin China so that in all, after taking into account  the small number owned by other nationa&amp;ties, there are in Chins over -g- million spindles and nearly 26,000 looms.   A considerable expansion is taking place in the export trade of cotton piecegoods from China as the following figures show:-  in 1922 111,000pieces, whilst in 1928 there were 2,000,000 pieces.   figures have been taken out which show the cost of 120 yards of a standard grey cloth made In China as compared with  the cost of theidentical cloth made in Lancashire.   Ex go-down at Shanghai thecost of the latter -works out at 3/6 per lump (or piece) more thanthat of the corresponding Chinese manufacture.   In this connection it is of interest to note that under present methods of marketingthere is a difference in selling cost of nearly 15% in favourof China as compared with Lancashire.   The average hourly wage rates for spinning and weaving in Chins are lid. as comparedwith India 2^-d, Japan 3ld, and England. 8^d..  As regard coal ChineIs well placed, her reserves of this source of power beingestimated at more than five times that of Great Britain.   a stimulus Is being given to China&apos;s industry by the  heavy fall inthe price of silver and the corresponding drop in the valueof the  tael.   Twelve months ago the exchange value of the taelwas round about 2/7.   It is now just over 2/-.  Assuming thatthe internal value of the Chinese currency has not  substantiallychanged the cost of imported goods is increased through thefall in silver by-approximately 25%.   In other words the fallin the exchange value of the tael has the effect of a protectivetariff.  This of course may be on.y temporary as, with low price and increasing stock of silver internal values will graduallyadjust themselves to the new conditions.  Moreover,  if silvercontinues to fall it may lead the Chinese authorities to considerthe stabilisation of the currency on a gold basis.   An indication of the trend of events in this direction is the decision of theChinese Government, as from February 1st, to colleot importduties on a gold basis in order to provide the necessary funds tomeet foreign loan obligations.  This method prevents the real aostof China&apos;s foreign debts from fluctuating according to the priseof silver.   Japan&apos;s Increasing share of the imports of piece goodsinto China is an outstanding feature of recent years,   In 1924Japan&apos;s share was 51.3% as compared with 69.2% in 1927, thelatest year for which it has been possible to obtain theinformation.   For the corresponding years, Great Britain&apos;s share was 35.6% and 15.6% respectively, or a deoline of 20%as against Japan&apos;s increase of 17.9%.
&amp; ll J     Mr. Shaw:   Do those last percentages refer to cotton or general textiles?     Mr. Lennox Lee:   Cotton only     Mr. Shaw:   Have yeu any difficulty in securing figures which you are quoting because we have had difficulty in getting the Chinese figures for the wool trade?   Perhaps, you could give me the source at some other time.     Mr. Lennox Lee:   Yes, our only source Is in China.     Mr. Shaw:  It has never been possible to get reliablefigures for China.     Mr. Gillett:  It is not a very hopeful account you havegiven us from the British&apos;standpoint.     Mr. Lennox Lee:   China is a real trouble to Lancashire.You may say that Japan is all right.  China is really the source of dangac     Mr. Gillett:   Is i,here any Indication that China islikely to be a much larger consumer as time  goes on?     Mr. Lennox Lee:  Yes, it will be.     Mr. Giliett:  You think that is so, that there is atendency for the Chinese internally to become more prosperous?     Mr. Lennos Lee:  Yes, and then they will become largerconsumers .     Mr. Gillett:  Once they  can get an ordered government there might be a demand for goods which would swallow up theirown manufactures and make them want them from outside aswell.  Is that a possibility?     Mr. Lennox Lee:  I think there is no question about it that the trade will expand enormously.     Mr. Gillett:  That is rather whet I suggest in view ofsuch an enormous population.     Mr. Lennox Lee:  It  is 400 million people.  They can takenot only all this but a great deal more of exported goods.We are exporting now to India from Shanghai at considerably less than the Lancashire  prioe.     Mr. Gillett:  Is there any indication that the stabilisation of currency on the gold basis will cause a fall of prioes in China?  Is that being seriously considered byChina?     Mr. Lennox Lee:  At  the moment it is only a possibility.
                           Cotton.     MR. H.W. LEE:  I am afraid Mr. Chairman that my report will not add to the gaiety of the Council, because theposition In cotton textile in Lancashire is very gloomy.xAs you know, in the coarse trade there is already a number ofmills which have stopped and that section of the trade is nowdiscussing whether they shall have another short time movement.If you look at the figures of last year you will see that weagain lost on the figures of 1928 and the demands so far in1930 are infinitesimal, worse than in 1929.  Whether they willmake a special arrangement for short time I do not know.   Ithink it is rather doubtful, but in any ease I am afraid thata considerable amount of more shnrt time will be run or anumber more spindles will be stopped.  That is in the coarserend of the trade,.  In Egyptian yarns the position at themoment is quite deplorable.  Prom my own experience fcr fineyarns and fine textiles I should say that there are no orderscoming in at present, at all events not more than will occupybO% of the machinery going.  There is no organised short time, but there is a great deal of machinery stopped and that amount Is increasing daily.  The profits in the trade have dissapeared and altogether the prospect is very poor.  I cannottell you precisely why it should have gone to such a poor conditionwithin the last eighteen months, because up to then it ran fairlywell.  Of course there is no doubt that fashions are changingand then there is another thing that affects us all seriously,and that is we have had a heavy fall in the raw materials, andas long as that fall continues buyers are not offering.  Theyhave stuff on their hands which will decrease in value and bereturned at a lyss and they will not run -the risk of a loss andthen of course there is the great uncertaint;/ about tariffs andtaxation and everything of that sort, matters which I take it i must not mention at this Council, but altogether there is noquestion that the prospects at the moment to this trade are very bad indeed and I really do not see any great prospect of a quickimprovement.  I am sorry that I have to make such a badreport, but I hope that when we meet next month I shall be ableto say something better.                          Hosiery.     MR.  TALKER:   I am afraid with regard to the hosiery tradeI have not any bright news.  Trade generally in that tradeis mure stagnant  than it has been for a considerable period.Reports from all  centres are far from satisfactory,  &quot;Nottinghamreports that the  volume of trade passing at the present time is small, even for what is recognised as one of the quietestmonths of the year.  Amongst the factors contributory to thedepression is the abnormally mild weather, and whilst manufacturers of underwear do not anticipate repeat orders in January, there is often a good deal of stock cleared, should the weather be cold.The decision of the Chancellor to postpone a declaration of his policy with regard to the artificial silk duty until the budget is most unfortunate as during the month of April this tradecommences and will now be delayed,  and probably much of it will see also report from Sir Kenneth Stewart, p. 40  .                -13-
be lost altogether because preparations cannot be made until it is known what tho policy of tho Government is to be.Along with other commoditios such as rubber, tin, copper,the price of wool has been considerably depressed and buyersaro very cautious and anxious to get in at the bottom; thiswould appear to have been roashed, as a reaction has apparentlyset in. Spring orders for footwear and underwear are nowbeing executed. The prospect of trade with the United states is none too good.  Orders are usually placed about this time of tho year, but tho financial position is well known and may adversely affect business.  No consideration isexpected from Australia; the Government of that Dominionsays, in effect, that it has prohibited the import of hosieryby exorbitant tariffs, and the remedy is to establishbranches and manufacture in that country.  The scandinavian countries are now considering placing their -orders for theAutumn, principally cashmere footwear, both plain and fancy.These countries aro inundated with foreign made underwearand hose, and judging from the economic conditions prevailing in Germany, more intensive competition from that country maybe anticipated, with the prospect of the market beingflooded with goods made under conditions of labour, asregards working conditions and wages not to be toleratedhere.  New Zealand and South Africa are sending normalenquiries and orders.     Leicester reports demands in most branches of the hosierytrado aro on a moderate scale and owing to the fall in woolvalues and the lack of seasonable weather, buyers are holdingoff except for immediate requirements.  There has been some increase in temporarily suspended and short time workers.Some improvement has taken place in the demand for sportswear. The continued hoavy importation of foreign goods andthe uncertainty of the position with regard to silk dutiescausod by the Chancellor&apos;s pronouncement havo had very serious effects upon trade.  Loughborough states that trade is badand worse than a month ago.  It is also worse than a year ago.The whole trade is on short time, more signing on at theLabour Exchange than for some considerable time.  I am afraidthe hosiery trade is not having a good time.                            .5P.I-Oyi?SJ3t *     MR. T.W.PHILLIPS:   The general trend of tho unemploy-mentfigures has been disappointing and not what is normal atthis time of tho year.  The Council will remember that we didnot have the usual sharp fall in tho figures before Christmas.In spite of this thero was a rise ef over 200,000 immediatelyafter Christmas.  Thon came a fall of 31,000 in tho first week of this yoar, which according to previous experienceshould have been followed by similar falls in succoedingwooks.  Instead of this, thero wore only slight falls for two weeks, and substantial increases in tho next two weeks sothat tho total at 3rd February (1,508,600) was only slightlybelow the peak figure reached after Christmas.  These figurescan only be accounted for by general slackness, but there
CONFIDENTIAL *                   ^48were two trades in particular which contributed to them, -namely cotton and wool, both of which showed marked increases.Coal on the other hand improved substantially between the endof December and the end of January,  A noticeable feature hasboon the increase of unemployment among women and girls,amounting to 29,000 between 30th Decembor and 3rd February.Among men and boys there was a decrease of 30,000in the same period.   This is largely a reflection of the-position in cotton and wool on the one hand and ooal on theother.  I will put in the usual table of the numbers ofinsured persons in employment55,.  This will show adecrease botweon December and January, but an increase of61,000 over a year ago.                         Iron and Steel.     MR.PUGH:  Well, Sir,  as far as our renort in theiron and steel trade are concerned conditions generallyremain somewhat irregular.  In  some weeks we are quite active and have good orders but in others tho  amount of business is somewhat scarce.  There seem to be very few signs of improve-msnt in the pig iron trade;  reports from the mills showthat the demand for pig iron has fallen off in the latter partof the month. North East Coast  exports  have increased slightlyover the December figure.  In Cumberland the orders forhematite iron from the Continent and America are fairlysubstantial. The Carlton iron works of  Dorman Long and company have definitely to close down in March; only one furnace hasbeen in operation for some time, making ferro-manganese whichin future will be manufactured  at the South Bank Works of theCompany. The transference  will  result in 200 men being thrown out cf employment. The Consett  Iron Company have started one  -of their largest blast furnaces which had been out of action for seme time.  In Scotland five furnaces have been dampeddown but we understand that this is largely for repair workand they will come into commission again shortly. Wrought ironis in demand for cast iron bars for engineering purposes. Inother ways there is little improvement  particularly with regardto the other classes cf iron and the Continental products havebeen offered at Birmingham at prices considerably below theprices at which it is possible  for home producers to sell at.  ,After the trouble of last  year  the steel trade appears to be slightly falling off; the  English Steel Corporation has closed down one of its works and  has concentrated  the work in one ofthe other establishments of tho Corporation,  A similar ccursehas been taken as Mr.Mitchell has reoorted in respect of the-arrangement made between ene firm and Beardmores in Scotland.These two changes mean that when allowance has been made forsuch transfers as are practicable anything from 1,000 to 1,500men will find employment.  We understand that the special steelsof Sheffield are in greater demand and  it is reported that thereare orders in hand which will keep the  works running for sometime. The South Durham steel and iron company have restartedtheir plate mill where thero will be work provided for 150 men.K-See Appendix,  p. 52.
     The steel sheet trade is in a state of very acutedepression.  After some years of comparative prosperity alarge number of mills are closed without any hope of an earlystart.  This is having its effect in the South Wales areaparticularly on the steel bar manufacturers and there are twosteel works that have not resumed work since Christmas.  Theprice of sheets has fallen very low the price being  11.15s. aton while a year ago it was  13.15s. a ton.  The tin platetrade is one of the brighter spots In the industry and theyhave been fairly busy.  In the tube trade employment is comparatively good.  With the exception of the sheet tradesliding scale there is some improvement shown in prices duringthe last few months.                        Railway Traffic .     SIR C. HURCOMB:  At this time of the year theinterest in regard to railways depends on what the Chairmanare going to say at their annual meeting in a few weeks time.The results for the year 1929 as far as I have them stop shortat November.  During the first eleven months of the year themain line railway companies excluding the London tubescarried an appreciably larger number of passengers, a total increase of 2  , but they carried fewer of them at full fares and their receipts show an actual decrease of 3-%% and they hadto run 2j:% more train miles in order to carry their increasedtraffic.  As regards goods traffic the most interestingfeature is the increase in the carryings of coal of nearly llfas measured in tonnage.                         Motor Industry.     The only other points I would like to mention are thenumbers of motor vehicles registered for the first time duringthe quarter ended November 1929 .  That of course is the quarter when the figures are lowest out of all the quarters Inthe year.  The number of cars taxed on horse power (which are mainly private cars), was 29,187, about 650 less than in thecorresponding quarter of 1928.  Goods vehicles show a somewhatremarkable Increase of 13,874 as compared with 10,669 the year before.  Motor Hackney vehicles show a small decrease andother miscellaneous vehicles an increase.  The total vehiclesof all classes excluding motor cycles were 46,141 as against43,353.  Motor cycles for the quarter show a slight increase over the same quarter of 1928 of about 700, though they were less for the same quarter of 1927.     MR. GILLETT:  Is there any special reason to explain that increase in the goods vehicles?     SIR C. HURCOMB;  Of course these figures are only those which are registered for the first,  time.  I cannot say how many of them are replacing old vehicles which have been
                      OOm IDLIJTIAL.scrapped or are additions to the fleet of vehicles, but thereis a constant growth in the amount of traffic by road and moreand more people use these lorries and so on for transportingtheir goods, and. the growth has been fairly constant.  1928shows an increase of over 2,600 in that quarter over 1927.     ME. GILLETT;  Would, you suggest that this is being done at the expense of the  railways?     SIR 0. HDRGOiuB:  some  of it must mean a loss oftraffic to the railways, but it is very difficult to measurethat.  Some of it may be new traffic, a good deal of it isin distribution in towns, much of it would not affect therailways at all, the larger delivery vans taking the place ofmessenger boys and horse vans.  There has been a very biggrowth among the lighter types of goods vehicles.                          Wool.     MR. A SEA.V;:  I think Mr. Phillips has already indicated the reports from the wool  side stating that it islikely to be very depressing.  I have been looking anxiouslyforvvard to the time when I  could give a report to this council that things were looking up.  The outstanding feature hasbeen the Court of Enquiry which&apos;has  been held during the past month, and to that extent I think it will have relieved thetrade as a whole of a considerable amount of anxiety, becauseof the fact that for six months there has been the possibilityof disputes and the extending of disputes has- not helped thetrade to recover.  Well, now that the Enquiry has been heldI think everybody is looking for the report in the hopes thatit will be the means of making a settlement and giving thetrade a chance to get on its feet again.  The trade itself isvery depressed.  1929 has been about the worst year we havehad for a long period.,  and this of course may be largelyaccounted for by the decrease in our export trade.  it applies to all sections, and in the  exports of tops and yamsduring the last year they have decreased by 4,000,000 lbs.,and the tissues by 18,000,000 square yards.  It will be recalled that I presented rather a long report two months agoon the position as I looked upon it  in our export trade with australia, China and Japan, and I then indicated that bythe end of the year as against 1924 I estimated that our loss in the export trade to those countries would have been55,000,000 square yards.  That has been borne out by thefigures I am now able to bring up to date.  In 1924 weexported 221,000,000 square yards and of this 85,000,000 square yards were exported to China, Japan and Australia.  In 1929we have now fallen to 155,000,000 square yards and we have got to 26 , 000 , 000 to those countries, or in effect out of thetotal loss of 66,000,000 square yards from 1924  up to 1927these three countries account for 57.5 millions.  Well, in my judgment there is very  little hope of recovery of those markets and it would  appear that the trade will have to turn attention in other directions if we are going to recover the export market.  The  machine activity this year as against last year
                                                    sj 1                       COM; IDj&amp;TIAL:.has decreased by 7% and from 1924 by 12%.  That is the actualmachines that are running.  The price of v/ool has been referredto but just for the purpose of recording the figures I should like to say taking 1914 as 100 the price for January 1950 forraw materials v.as 38 as against 100, tops were 94, yarns 118and the group number exactly IOC, or the pre-war price.  Thereports that I have received from our own district are verydoleful indeed.  There has been a remarkable increase inour unemployment figures during the past months.  One can hardly account for it;  particularly in one district, whichis usually fairly stable,  the unemployment has increasedtremendously.  I am referring to the Huddersfield trade and itis general not only in the fine cloths but in the heavy woollendistricts.  Our unemployment figures for January show that over 23% of the members were signing the Unemployment Register.In the Bradford trade the  number has increased from 15% inDecember to well over 20% in January.  In Batley and Dswsburythey have gone from 23% to 28% and the trade in Huddersfieldhas fallen off and the average of 9% in December has increasedto nearly 16% and in the last week in January the section ofthe trade which we rely on in Huddersfield for our trade, theunemployment figures had gone up to 23%.     MR. GILLETT;  &apos;yVe shall all be very pleased when you realiseyour ambition and give us  a cheerful report.  It i s far fromthat today.  It Is the position in Yorkshire I know.  I was there last week and I heard something about the extraordinarydifficulties there.                        Engineering.     MR. SROrtNLIE:   My report will be quite as cheerful asthose which have preceded.  We live in doleful times, as youappreciate.  Mr. Phillips has given the state of unemploymentwith regard, to the  nation&apos;s industry.  I wish to give somefigures regarding my own organization, the Amalgamated Engin-eering Union.  Our  figures show that the members unemployed in December of last year numbered 12,356, or 5.9 per cent, inJanuary 13,644, or  6.54 per cent, while our most recent figuresissued this month,  for February, show 15,805, that is 6.64 percent.  There is an  increase in the unemployment figures of something like 1,500 from December to February.     Trade in general engineering is fair, and. in certain partsof marine engineering much better than It was twelve months ago.In the electrical industry it is good, in textile machinebuilding it is extremely bad.  We find, that a large number ofour members are not only unemployed, but are working short time.In and around Oldham we have members who have not worked a fullweek, not had a full week&apos;s employment, in two years, theyhave probably been  working two, three or four days a week.
                                                             O fa     That is the general state of the industry as  we see itat the moment.   It may be within your  recollection that inNovember, when I was last present, Mr.  John Richmond, in thecourse of his Report, mentioned the fact that the  EngineeringEmployers&apos; Federation were meeting the  Engineering Unions onthe 21st of that month, for the purpose of the Employers giving to the Unions their considered reply to the Unions&apos;  applicationfor an advance In wages as stated at a  Conference  In June oflast year.   In effect the Employers&apos; reply, expressed by theirChairman, was that while the Engineering Employers would beglad and willing to increase the earnings of the workpeopledid the state of trade warrant such being done, the state oftrade, as shown by the figures quoted by the Employers&apos;  Chairman,proved to their own satisfaction, that  they were not justifiedin placing an additional burden upon the Engineering industry.Needless to say the Representatives of  the Unions  did not receive the statement made by the Employers&apos; Chairman with enthusiasm, on the contrary they were very much annoyed and itwas decided by the Unions&apos; Conference on that date to reportthe whole of the proceedings that had transpired at the special conference with the Employers to their  respective  Executives,and Reports were received by those Executives at a subsequentConference which was held on 22nd January.   Reports were givento the effect that much dissatisfaction was expressed at theEmployers&apos; non-response to their application which had been somewhat protracted in its consideration, and after considerationof the Reports submitted the Conference adopted the followingresolution, &quot;That this Conference appoint a representativeDeputation to approach the Engineering and Allied  Employers&apos;National Federation requesting them to  submit out  wages claim to arbitration: failing agreement they approach- the Government toset up an inquiry on the lines of the present investigation inthe cotton and iron and steel industries.  Further the deputation to particularly direct the attention of the Government to thestatement of the Employers&apos; Chairman regarding wages and social services&quot;.     Communications have passed between the two bodies and theEmployers have agreed to receive the Deputation on the 26th of  thismonth.   The Deputation as stated in the Resolution will make anappeal to the Engineering Employers to  submit a wages applicationto arbitration.   I do not know what the Employers will say inreply to that request but I have a shrewd suspicion that theiranswer will be in the negative.   They are not likely to agreeto refer a wages application to the Court of Arbitration.  However,v;e shall have to listen to what they have to say on the 26th ofthe month.     With regard to the second part of  the Resolution, asking theGovernment to set up an. investigation as is at present takingplace in the cotton and steel Industries, we shall have to waitand see what happens there.     That covers about all I have to say to this Council at themoment.  I echo the sentiment expressed by my friend Mr. ArthurShaw.   I do hope to be in a position of submitting what Iconsider to be a very pleasing and gratifying Report before I ceasemy attendances at these meetings, but I &apos;hae ma doots&apos;.
it on  also handed  in a Report for which  see Appendix, p. 40.\                                 Wool.        MR.DOUGLAS HAMILTON&apos;&quot;&apos;:  I  think  that Mr.Shaw has  covered  the    ground pretty well.  His report has not boen  too glowing  or  his    outlook too promising.        I noticed that  a  question was  asked  in Parliament  yesterday    as  to what effect  the  fall  in wool  prices had on employment.   I    think it is obvious  that the  continued fall that has now  lasted    for nearly two years in the price of wool has been perhaps the    main contributing  factor to bad trade in  the  woollen and  worsted    industries, and I  was  glad  to hear  from Mr.Sanderson that he is    of ,opinion that the  best way  to cure this sort of thing is not    by  forcing the price up.  The proper way, I think, and  the method    which would appeal to  industrialists, is  by increasing  the    production of wool.  By increasing, the output of wool,which    certainly can be absorbed by  the industry, the grower will secure    a more permanent benefit than by forcing up prices.  It is true    that at present wool is being sold  in Australia at less than the    cost of production.  It is estimated that  it costs one  shilling    a pound to grow wool in Australia and wool is being  sold  to-day    at  9d. or lOd. a pound.  We have always found in the wool trade    that low prioos bring  trade and I see no  reason to believe that    the exceptionally  low  wool  prices that we are having at present    will not have a similar effect and  I am anticipating that trade    in  our industry will be better than it has been in 1929.        There is no real  substitute for wool.  Artificial  silk  has    had a vogue, wool  substitutes have  been tried and have  not proved    very satisfactory, and I am quite confident that the coming  year,    given stability of wool prices, will see  a general all-round    improvement in the wool textile trade. . Up to this year we have    been in the unfortunate position of sooing our foreign  compsti-    tors all well employed and  our trade has  been declining.  This    last year the wool trade throughout the world in every  country    that I have come across has been distinctly bad, so  that  we  have    not been suffering at  any rate very much  in excess of  those    other wool textile producing  countries and there is  some  cold    comfort to be drawn  from that fact, but I think, on  the whole,    that we may anticipate that during  the coming year a certain    measure of prosperity  will  return to the  industry.        MR.GILLETT:   I  suppose the point is  that your trade  are    waiting to satisfy themselves that  the fall in the cost of wool    is  more or less reaching the  bottom?        MR.HAMILTON:  Yes.        MR.GILLETT: That  is their view rightly or wrongly, and    then the orders may  begin to  come in?
fa itCOUPIDSNTIAL.     MR.  HAMILTON:   Yes.    There have been considerably moreorders placed during the  past few weeks than there have been forseveral months because it is felt that the action of the Brokersand the growers in Australia to stop the rot has been effective and that it is not likely that prices will fall locver, that anysubstantial crop is almost impossible.     MR.  GILLETT:   It Is one of the things that rather struckme in some of the Reports to which we have listened.  You first-hear a depressing account from these using, a certain commodityas to their raw material  and then you receive from the people who are dealing in the raw material an equally depressingaccount.    I cannot help  feeling that somehow it is not quite a natural state of affairs  because if the raw material is verycheap one would think that those dealing with it would get thebenefit and that we should not have a depressing account from both the producers and the men working with  the raw material,and yet all over it seems a3 if you are in that state, that neither the one nor the other is benefiting.  I am pleased to hear from you that you think your industry will sooner or laterbegin to benefit from the fact that there was a fall in theprice of wool, - which is what I gather you mean - that ultimatelyyou will benefit from the fall In the price of wool, whatever mayhappen to the people producing that wool.     MR. HAMILTON:  Mr. Shaw gave certain figures starting withthe cost of wool and going up to the yarn and piece -.oods. .1 donot know whether he could, have carried, on and. given us the costof the readymade suit or  the price of the cloth that a lady paysover the counter.   That, of course, is the &apos;snag&apos; about theposition, that the fall in wool prices takes such a tremendouslylong time to reach the consumer.   They do get a certain amountof benefit, but not as quickly as they ought to do.     MR. GILLETT:   I do not know whether it concerns those of uswho sear suits, but I cannot say myself that I have ever found mytailor suggest that he is going to sell me suits cheaper thanthey have been for a number of years.     SIR GEORGE BEEAF.RELL:  I have a vivid, recollection oftailore putting up their prices when wool went very high.     MR. BEN TURNER:   Have the raw vrool prices had a depressing effect on the other parts of the raw material for cloth manu-facture, namely, the shoddy or rag market, the rags for shoddy,are the prices there up or down?     MR. HAMILTON:  It is rather a remarkable thing that the ragprices and shoddy prices  have not dropped in conformity with theprices of raw wool.   I should think they would have to fall intime, but the position is rather complicated, by the fact that russia and. the United States have been importing rags in ratherlarge quantities and the prices of those things&quot;have been kept upby abnormal demand from those two countries:  but they are at aneconomically high level,  in other words a suit of clothes made out of good wool is relatively cheap compared to a suit of clothes.made out of shoddy.
     MR.  BEN TURNER:   Is  the  best  shoddy higher  than the priceof ordinary wool,  because sometimos  there Is hotter shoddy  than some wools, of course, but I  mean  is the best  shoddy higher thanthe ordinary price of fair wool?     MR.  HAMILTON:  Yes,  for  the reason that it  gets into Americaat a favourable rato, whoroas wool has  to pay  a  very high rate toprotect, the growers of wool.    But that Is quite an abnormal stateof things,    That  particular  class of material is far  tooexpensive for any  English or  European manufacturer to  use.     MR.  BEN TURNER:   You and I were at a place  on Friday wherethey were very depressed  in the shoddy  and rag trado.                           Chemicals.     Mr.  HILL:   The exports of chemicals,  drugs,  dyes  and coloursfor 1929  exceed  261 million sterling, which is an incroaao  of14 per cent, over 1927 and 5 per cent, over 1928.   Imports  over1929 wore  17 million sterling, which is an increase of 9 percent, ovor the  past two yoars.     In the field of miscellaneous and hoavy chemicals there hasboon an increase in exports of 11 per cent, since 1928, thegreater part of which is due to sulphate of ammonia which is nowgoing to the east in steadily increasing quantities.   Importshave increased  by 15 per cent.   The home  trade has shown a  steadyand reassuring  improvement as regards many of the heavy chemicalssuch as acids and alkalis.   To take one example, sodium sulphate,a common by-product which used to accumulate to such an extent that it was impossible to find an outlet for it,  is now being used in such increasing quantities,  for instance  in the paperindustry, that  it is doubtful whether there will  be sufficientduring 1930 to  meet the demand.     The yoar&apos;s total shows that our dyo exports  have  increasedby 20 por cent, which is a satisfactory feature in view of thointensive foreign competition.   Tho conquest of  new markets fordyos involves giving besides good material good technical advice to tho users of the dyes, and that has only boon  done  during thepast year.   Previously our offorts  have beon devotod  to improve -ment of research and manufacture, but now it has  been  possible toprovide that other service vfciioh is  necessary for developing theexport tradeo   This development has been  rendered possible  underthe protection  afforded by the Dyestuffs Act and  there is everyhope of continued expansion In this  field.  Tho dyo industry andfine chomical industry use annually  about  3 million gallons  ofBenzol and Toluol in manufacturing,  so that the increase of  4d.a gallon which  they suffered owing to recent tacos on  hydro-carbon oils means  50,000 a year.   Naturally they are watchingthis proposal to substitute a petrol tax for a h.p. tax on motors,bec&amp;use it is assumed that if there  were a tax on potrol therewould have to be a corresponding tax on Benzol and other organicliquids usable  as motor fuel, so that they are looking to asystem of rebates in favour of Benzol used in chemicalmanufacture should that materialise.
\5 I&quot; p J 01                              0 ONF I.DENTJ; AL.     One other small Report to round off a previous Report. the plant installed by Imperial Chemical Industries for the synthetic manufacture of acetic acid has now been successfullystarted and the home capacity taken in conjunction with the related factors in Canada is expected shortly to be in aposition to meet the whole requirements of this country.     MR.GILLETT; That is a rather more cheerful Report thanmany we have had.                            Rubber.     SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL: I am sorry that my Report cannot beperhaps quite so cheerful as the one to which you have justlistened, but I do not think it sinks quite to the depths ofdespondency that some of the earlier communications havereached. The rubber industry, of course, is, first of all,ruled by the prosperity or lack of prosperity of the motor industry, as tyres represent a very large percentage of theoutput of the rubber factories. The demand for motor cars inthe first months of this year certainly shows a falling off ascompared with last year, and that was a slight falling offagain as compared with the previous year. That follows thefalling off for the whole of what we might call the motor carseason, that is the  period immediately following the Motor Show.Sir Cyril Hurcomb&apos;s figures of new registrations confirm tosome extent that falling off in the output of motor cars. Infact, in some of the works short time is becoming &quot;rather bad.That is reflected, of course, in the rubber industry. A falling off in motor cars means a falling off in the demand far tyres.     So far as the replacement business is concerned, thatkeeps at about a steady level. I think there is a little longerlife in the product and the renewal demands are coming a littlelater, but they will come as motor cars are used and I think the consumption of petrol shows that there is at any rate thesame amount of motoring taking place to-day as a year ago.     The bright side of the industry is the development of thegiant pneumatic tyre. That is going ahead faster than even its best wishers could have hoped.  It is accompanied by a seriousdrop in the solid tyre, but I think that we all look upon thatwith a certain amount of pleasure because we are undoubtedlygetting better vehicles and probably less wear and tear on theroads.     The export trade is not too bad, in fact there is a slight increase, but probably hardly maintaining our percentage of the potential. It is a rapidly growing potential in some markets,but I-do not think we are doing more than maintain our position,if we are quite maintaining our position, in the export field.The competition in the export field is very very keen and prices are by no means as satisfactory as they should be.
     Cycle tyres had a very good year last year. Probably a record number of cycle tyres were made of any year in the his-tory of cycling.  That seems to be continuing.     MR.GILLETT:  Is that motor and other cycle tyres?     SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL:  No, I am speaking of &apos;push-bikes&apos;.I have not referred much to the motor cycle tyre4.  It is smallin itself and you may take it that it is about a steady figurewith no marked change either way but the growth of pedal cyclinghas been phenomenal in the last two or three years, not onlyin this country but in many others,and it has been, and goes on, steadily increasing in capacity, and that in spite of keenforeign competition, particularly in tubes, but at any ratethe industry as a whole has been able to meet that reasonably well.     Turning to the more general rubber goods, boots and shooshave felt the mild winter very much indeed. It has, I am afraid,caused an accumulation of stocks in the hands of dealers,and itwill be a long time before that industry can really get goingagain. It will probably be a very slow start up for next winter&apos;a trade.  The trade in rubber soles and heels is oon-continually growing but there is enormous competition from abroad and at extraordinarily low prices-     Makers of sports goods seem to be very well employed and Iget good returns from practically all the sports factories.     Waterproof garments have now, I think, got through the very bad effect of the dry summer on that particular branch of thetrade. They have had a reasonably good two or three months with heavy goods, and orders are coming in quite well for the lightgoods for the Spring trade.     Mechanicals is not satisfactory, but, of course,that de-pends on the activity of our heavy industries. If they arebusy there will be more demand for rubber goods, while if theyare short of work that re-acts on this industry,     nose and belting and flooring are in reasonably fair demand.     Surgicals is a steady market but there is practically noexport at all.     On the whole, I think the workers in the rubber industry are reasonably well employed, probably up to, say, 80 per cent.to 85 per cent.                          The. Money , Market.     LORD BRADBURY:  A notable feature of the London MoneyMarket during the last month has been the development of anabnormally wide margin between the official bank rate and open market rates.  As a result of easy money and a strongcontinental demand for Bills the three months&apos; bill rate fellrapidly until it was even below 4 per cent.  That was at the timeof the 5 per cent. Bank rate.
fa d o     With a 5 per cent. Bank rate this was, of course, ananomalous state of affairs that could, not continue for long.The question was whether it would be adjusted by a fall in theBank rate or by a rise In market rates.   There seemed to bo vorylittle chance of a rise in the Bill rates so long as the easein money and the strong demand for Bills continued and there wasno sign of any official attempt to tighten money.     The Bank did not seem inclined to run the risk of loweringits rate prematurely.   Perhaps the exchange did not givesufficient assurance that a fall in Bank rato might not have tobo counteracted by a rise again in the near future or it mayhave been considered that a lower interest rate in London mightoffer undue inducement to untimely foreign borrowing here,   Atany rate the Bank rate was not reduced, to 4-?r per cent, until boththe French and German rates were also lowered by a half of 1 perccnt;   The fall in our Bank rate took place on February 6theThe New York Federal Reserve rate was simultaneously reduced from-&amp; per cent, to 4 per cent8 and the interest rates of theprincipal countries were again in the same relative position at a lower level.     The gold reserve of the Bank of England was  151 million onFebruary 5th,   This is an increase of  5 million since thebeginning of the year, attributable mostly to shipments of 2 million from Australia and the same amount from Spaina   ItIs noticeable that the Bank has refrained lately from biddingfor gold above the statutory buying price and in the absence ofthis a good deal of gold coming into the market has been boughton German, account.     The sterling exchange on New York has weakened a good dealsince the beginning of January.   It was then over 4,83 and isnow below par at 4,86 and 15/64ths,   The German rate is alsoweaker and is not far about the export gold point.   The Frenchrate, on the other hand,, is over 124, and looks safer than ithas been for a long time.     The rapid weakening of the American Exchange just referredto is a little disquieting, particularly if the reasons putforward, for it are at all well-founded.   It is said that thereis an abnormal tendency at present for balances to drift from london to New York and for money seeking investment to find ahome in New York rather than in London,     The Stock Exchange has been dull with no appetite for newIssues apart from the recent short term India Loan for  6 million,,which was very successful and which has given a fillip to thegilt-edged market during the past day or two.   The recent issueof  7 million Central Electricity 5 per cent. Stock rosultedin 90 per cent,, being left with the Under-writers and an issueof the Corporation of Brighton also left Under-writers with aconsiderable amount.     The new 5 per  cent. Conversion Loan was paid, up in fullon the 1st February without any inconvenience to the money market and- the proceeds have evidently gone partly to reduce theTreasury Bills outstanding, which have been reduced by 60,000,000 since the beginning of the year,

As regards tin,  as Mr, Pugh told us, we think the tinplate industry is working at over 75 percent., capacity and has a very good order book.   The demand fortin from South. Wales is good.   In Spelter the  situation ismore gloomy.   Galvanised sheet trade is sctremely poor.   Ithas not been worse for some years and that is largely due tovery bad Indian inquiry.   As to lead, the consumption is normalbut the high price of copper undoubtedly restricts the demandfor lead covered cable.     The metals as a whole, in common with everything else,appear to be very much in over-supply and we think in theindustry that the only possible solution for the situation isto curtail production by means of international CartelscThat movement has already taken place in copper where the price is controlled by America,,   It is now being applied to the tinindustry by means of working 32 hours a week less In the malay states, and there is the same general scheme in Nigeria, and I         If Re GILLETT:  Is that drift of money to New York due to    the fact that people think it has reached &quot;bottom and that there    will be a rise there, or due to anything political on this side,    or to other reasons?         LORD BKAD3URY;  It is rather difficult to say.  Of  course    the slump in the New York Stock Exchange prices made a ,good    many American Investments much more attractive.   On the other    hand there has been a feeling of pessimism and unrest here    which may have, had an effect,         CAPTAIN LYTTELTON:  On the day of the issue of the    Corporation Loan which was left entirely with the underwriters,    the Canadian National Railways issued some 5 per cent0 Stock    at 99-g- which was entirely subscribed in Canada, by the English    Trust Companies investing their money in that particular issue,    where they would not have tho Brighton Corporation Loan here.    That can only be sentimental, because the price was actually    one point higher in Canada than the same Issue here.         MRe GILLETT:  It is rather strange about Brighton, because    one would have thought that Brighton was a Municipality rather    out of the distressed areas.         LORD HLADBURY-  The Corporation Loans were rather high    having regard to gilt-edged Stocks such as Funding Loan;  There    has been nothing attractive in the others.         MR, GILLETT:  I see that the Hastings Loan went very well.         LORD BRADEURY:  Very Well.
think it undoubtedly must come with spelter and lead as well.Lead is In very considerable over-supply.   The price ismaintained by an international selling arrangement, but as faras we can see the world&apos;s production of lead will be about150,000 tons more than Its consumption.   In spelter, thesituation is even more gloomy,    .As a whole the manufacturing trade which we supply seemsto be working at a normal rate,     MR. GILLETTj  I am much obliged to you gentlemen for your attendance and the Reports that you have given.
APPENDIX.MR. RIDLEY W ARB. AM  handed in the following Report,-          THE BRITISB^C^AWNDUSTRY IN 1929.     The British coal  industry in common with those 6fother coal producing countries In Europe enjoyed a rather more favourable year than In 1928.  This is shown both by thevolume of production and exports and by the working resultsof the Collieries.   Already at the end of 1928 there weroindications that the depression which, apart from thetemporary improvement  due to the replenishment of suppliesafter the British stoppage, had prevailed for some years was passing away and with the onset of particularly severe weather conditions at  the beginning of 1929 a complete changein the situation came  about.     The recovery in the export demand which resulted notonly in increased sales but also  in an increase  in the levelof coal prices  on the  competitive markets  of the world wasone  of the most satisfactory features of  1929 from the pointof vie?/ of the  British coal industry.     European production in 1929  showed an increase of 7-jg/iover 1928.  The share  of Great  Britain in the total productionof 713 million  metric  tons  increased  by approximately 19-gmillion tons, while  in Germany  the output including the coalequivalent of lignite  increased by 15 million tons, that ofPoland by 5 million  tons,  that  of France -by 2 million tons,that  of Holland by   million  tons and that of Russia by 4 million tons  Production  in  Belgium on the other  hand  declinedby  approximately % million tons.   These figures  show  the progress  made by Great Britain  in 1929, but a comparison with the  year  1913 indicates in a  striking manner the lost ground which Great  Britain  has still  to  make good In contrast  to other  producing countries  in  Europe,  British output  was  no less than 31 million tons  below the  1913  level,  but Germany shows  an increase of 52 million tons, France an Increase  of 10 million tons, the Netherlands  one  of 9-i million tons, Russia an increase  of  9 million tons  and  Belgium shows  an increase  of 4 million tons.      While  the active  demand  in 1929  was  partly due  to  the disclosure  of the dangers  attendant  upon  allowing stocks  of coal to fall so low  that a sudden cold spell such as  that in the beginning of 1929  might find consumers suffering from a pronounced shortage  of supplies,  the fact remains that  the effective demand in nearly all  consuming  countries was  in excess of that In 1928.  The  following  table which relates to coal only and does  not  take  into  account coke or lignite shows this  very clearly for some of  the more important continental countries:

In spite of the restrictions of the licensing system andthe increases in railway rates on foreign coal, which took placein Germany in December 1928 and October 1929, British exports tothat country were greater in 1929 than in either 1928 or 1927s                         Exports from Great Britain to Germany                                  1000  Metric tons.               1927..............        4,309               1928..............        5,454               1929 ..............        5,609     The position of Great Britain vis-a-vis Germany has been improved by the fact that the unfair competition of reparation deliveries of German coal has to some extent been mitigated bythe arrangements made at the Hague.     Imports into France in 1929 which totalled 231- million tons showed a considerable increase over 1928 when theyaggregated 17 million tons.   Imports from Great Britainincreased by 5 million tons, while imports from Germany showedan increase of jg- million tons.

On the totherhand exports to Algeria increased from 1% million tons in 1913to if million tons in 1929,     The greater part of the reduction in exports to the eastern mediterranean was due to decreased shipments to the Adriatic andEgypto     The increased shipments to North and Central America wentchiefly to Canada and North America in the shapo of Anthracite.In the South American region the volume of trade to Brazil was practically the same as in 1913 &quot;but the shipments to the Argentineshowed a decrease of approximately 2 million tons and those toChill and Uruguay decreases of   million tonse     The average f;,0ob, price of British ooal exported in 1929was 16s.,l061d as compared with 15s*7e29d in 1928 and 13s.l0d in1913*  The 1929 figure is 17% above the 1913 level  and 33%  above that of 1909 - 13.

QONFIDBNilAL.267     It will be seen that while British wages costs in October1929 were 54% above the 1909/13 level, thoso of the ftuhr onlyshowed an increase of 27/2 while in Poland tho increase was only     Since 1925 there has been a reduction of wages costs inGreat Britain amounting to 3/7-]? por ton while in tho Ruhr therehas been an increaso of -Id. per ton, and in Poland a reductionof 2-Jd, per ton.     The Importance of the relative levels of wages as adetermining factor in wages costs may be judged from thefollowing figures comparing the earnings per person per shift(including the value of allowances in kind) in the three countries.  In Great Britain the figure is 9/7, in the Ruhr8/ll and in Poland 4/3-1.     It is a matter for profound regret that at a time when thecoal mining industry of Great Britain seems in a -position to recover some of the ground it has lost on the world markets thatit should again be threatened with legislation which can only have the effect of increasing the costs of production andrendering more difficult its competitive struggle with foreignproducers v/hose Governments furnish them every assistance in maintaining and expanding their markets.  The statement of the prussian Minister of Commerce in a recent debate in the PrussianDiet very well expressed the solicitude of foreign governments in supporting the coal industry in their countries.  He statedthat the best policy for Germany in preparation for anIntornational ooal agreement was to strengthen the position ofthe German mines.  A similar policy might well be commended tothe British Government.

This is, however, probably not surprising in view of theserious fall in Freights, because one cannot be encouraged topurchase new tonnage when there is no reasonable prospect ofprofitable employment.NOTE    *-  Revised estimated figures.
MR. BOND SENT THE FOLLOWING REPORT, -     The Iron and Steel Industry in January,  1930.     The condition of the iron and steel Industry in all districtswithout exception is reported to bo unsatisfactory^   Thequieter conditions which have developed are due largely to continental competition but they are aggravated by tho uncertaintywhich exists with regard to the possibilities of new taxation inthe forthcoming budget and fears as to the effect of the CoalBill upon the Industry.   While until the last week or two works have been fairly busy on old contracts new orders are slow incoming forward and then for the most part are for early delivery:there is little disposition to place forward contracts.   Completestatistics for January production are not yet available but it isestimated that the steel output will approximate to 770,000 tons,which is about 110,000 tons more than the December production which was affected by the Christmas holidays.   Unless an earlyimprovement sets In the February production figures will show a sharp decline.     On the North East Coast, which produces over 30 per cent of the country&apos;s output of pig Iron and 20 por cent of the steeloutput, the demand for pig iron is declining due not so much tothe import of foreign material into that area as to thecompetition of other districts and the Continent in Cleveland&apos;snormal markets.   It was reported last woek, for instance, that10,000 tons of pig iron is to be shipped from Dunkirk toGrangemouth,   with regard to steel the lack of new orders hasbeon such that some stoel furnaces, have, recently been put out of commission, whilo some works are operating at only 50 per cent of capacity.     In Scotland a somewhat irregular start characterised thocommencement of the year, somo plants only resuming operations in the second.week of the year and others later.   The pig ironindustry is foeling the effect of competition from theContinent and from India while in steel orders have been ratherslow to come in,   Order books are slightly better now than theyhave been for some weeks although in many cases it is a matterof day to day business and it is not always  easy for orders tokeep abreast with production.     In South Wales the condition of the iron and steel marketsis weak although many of tho tinplate works are booked for sometime to come but the galvanized sheet market is very depressedwith no signs of improvement.     Sheffield reports restricted business in pig iron with aslight improvement in the demand for acid billets, but other districts all report unrelieved slackness.
MR. RICHMOND WROTE:-                       Marine Engineering     The outlook for marine engineering has not improved duringthe past month, and contracts are being completed Without acorresponding volume of new work coming along to replace them.The  placing at Barrow of the two P. &amp; 0. vessels with turbo-electric propulsion is significant of new development whichis receiving increasing attention from shipowners, and enquiriesfor similar installations are also being tendered for.  It musthowever, be kept in mind that the large electric section ofsuch installations, apart from the boilers and turbines, is supplied not by the marine engineering establishment, but bythe electrical engineering industry, so that the employmenteffect on marine engineering is thereby affected to an appreciable extent.     The trend towards higher pressures in steam continues toprogress, and Bauer Wach and other types of auxiliary turbine -equipment are being increasingly adopted.  Motor driven Tankeriscontinue to be placed both on the North East  Co8st and on the clyde, but in both areas there is a lack of the better classof  Liner orders.   The restriction of Admiralty work, of which both districts have previously secured a good share, makes theoutlook still more discouraging, and handicaps tenderingability.   A further disquieting feature is the indication ofsteps to be taken by Prance to retain a greater proportion ofher work In her own yards by increasing her facilities by Stateaid, so that oontracjts which formerly came to this country arelikely to be constructed at home.

SIR KENNETH STEWART wrote:-                           Cotton.     Business during January continued to be very quiet, infact it was a very depressing month, in all sections of thetrade.   This applies not only to the cotton&apos;trade in thiscountry, but all over the world.   An increasing volume ofevidence appears to show that Japan&apos;s position is about asbad as our own at present, and the rest of the world is nohappier,     There is, in fact, universal slump in the cotton trade.This will right itself in time and is a feature quite apartfrom the depressed condition of our cotton trade which hasbeen so much spoken of for some years past.     Other movements have included a ballot  of the Weavers&apos;Amalgamation, who asked their members whether they wereprepared to cease work to enforce their demand for an advanceof 12*$ in wages.   There were 92,142 votes  in favour of strike action and 43,531 votes against.   Nobody was surprisedwhen this did not lead to a strike, largely  because themarket was so quiet that nobody much cared.     There was a considerable amount of interest caused bythe Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Speech in Manchester during the month and especially in his statement that the &quot;City1&apos; was willingto take a hand in assisting schemes of re-organisation in thetrade of the country.   A number of such schemes were in theair and this statement has tended to crystalise them.   TheLancashire Cotton Corporation made its first issue of capitalcovering 29 of the Companies out of the 100  which it is itsaim to absorb.     MR. HAMILTON handed in the following report           Report of the Woollen and Worsted Industry                       for January 1950.     The month of January saw a further fall in the price ofwools and by-products reducing values in the markets of origin to considerably below the cost of production.   Theoutlook for the growers, particularly in Australia, was  so serious that they decided to curtail offerings, to extend the selling season to August, and to fix December prices asthe minimum below which no wool was to be sold.     The result of this action was to stop the rot and restorestability to the wool markets throughout the world.   Ordersfor tops, yarns and piece goods which had been held up cameforward with greater freedom, and produced a healthier and morecheerful turn in the industry.     Meanwhile, the machinery activity generally was the lowest on record except when running has been interfered withby an external influence like the coal strike of 1920 or thegreat slump of 1921.   Exception should be made also of themonth of July 1925 when everyone was making preparations to close down owing to labour troubles.
     There is. a little improvement in the West of Englandand  in the Yeadon and Guiseley districts, where things were very bad.   This improvement however is quite seasonal.     The most remarkable feature is the sudden collapse of theHuddersfield fine class trade.   The loom activity has fallen15% in one month, which is easily a record.   There is usuallya decline in January compared with the previous November (nocensus is taken in December), and one would have expected adecline this time, though no one could have foreseen what has actually hapoened.   The total activity has fallen from 74 to69 or 6% since November.     The opinion is generally held that when a subsequentanalysis is made it will show a great  falling off in the home trade.   Hitherto the home market has been, since 1924, fairlystable, and it would require an enormous fall in the exporttrade to bring about srch a reduction of machinery activity asthat recorded.     MR. LENNOX LEE handed in the following report; -         Report jo f^Federation of British Industries on             Trade conditions during &quot;January 1930.     General.   The state of business and industry continues tobe unsettled with no definite evidence of any immediate improve-ment.   Although the heavy fall in prices precipitated by the wall Street collapse seems to be nearly at an end, a considerableamount of time is bound to elapse before the raw materialproducing countries are in a position  to resume their purchases of foreign goods on a normal scale.     The extent to which the raw material markets have beendisorganised is indicated-by the&apos; fact&apos; that, amongst others, thefollowing commodities are at present in over-supply:-Vegetable oils, tea, rubber, nitrate, tin, copper, oil, wood pulp, wheat, cotton and wool.   The fall in wheat and wool has produced a critical situation, in Australia, while the attemptof the Canadian Wheat Pool to withhold supplies with a view to maintaining prices is causing unsettlement m Canada.   the over-production of tin is affecting conditions in Nigeria and parts of South Afnerxca, together with British Malaya, &quot;where the rubber situation is also causing uneasiness.   The West african colonies are suffering from the effects of over-production invegetable oils, while India has been affected both by the slump in textiles and an excessive supply of tea.     Recovery in these markets is likely to depend partly on how soon the business slump in the U.S.A. comes to an end -of which there is no immediate indication - and secondly on howsoon world money rates fall to a level which will both enableproducers of the above commodities to control stocks, and encourage consumers to resume their purchases of thosematerials.     The recent further falls in money rates in this countryand New York, as well as on the Continent of Europe, indicatethat this is appreciated in responsible monetary quarters.
     Our domestic situation appears to &quot;be marking time;  theGovernment&apos;s unemployment schemes, which are slowly materialisingare having a reassuring effect.     Ootton.   The condition of the cotton trade has become moreunsatisfactory during the month and although Egyptian Cottonmaintained a fairly steady price American cotton during the last three days of January fell sharply, losing ground by about -fdper lb.                                               1     Spinning &amp; Weaving^   There has been some shipment to egypt and there was &quot;&quot;new enquiry for bleaching sheetings, prints andgreys In which some useful lines were sold.   The threatenedgeneral strike of weavers has hung over the cotton trade for thegreater part of the month, the Weavers Amalgamation having askedits members to ballot as to whether they were prepared to ceasework in order to enforce the demand for 12^% advance on theirwages.   The majority in favour was not considered sufficientto enforce a general stoppage,     Finishing Trades.   In the bleaching section, althoughreceIptFaidae 11ver Ies during January recovered from the seasonal decline, they were below the level of the correspondingperiod last year.   Much the same conditions have been experienced by the Printers whose orders generally speaking havebeen for small lots.   Most overseas markets have displayed awaiting attitude and, although  a few plants are reported to havebeen fully occupied, it has been found necessary to close theworks of others, either wholly or partially, one or two days aweek.   The volume of dyeing done has shown a slight improvementbut it has not been up to the average of the preceding months.The decline in artificial silk dyeing appears to some extent tohave been arrested.     The proposed increase in customs duties in Egypt has resultedin large quantities of cotton goods being shipped and the ports are reported to be congested.   It is feared that these largeshipments will have an unfavourable effect upon trade in theimmediate  future.     In India, although an improvement is reported so far as the liquidation of stocks Is concerned, new business if being held upon account of the possible increase of duty and it is of interestto note that the Japanese are reported to be undertaking to paywhatever extra duty is levied.   The political situation is alsoadversely affecting business with this market.     The position in China has been aggravated, by the- course of silver during recent months with the result that business withthat country has been generally quiet,     Reports from the South &amp; Central American Markets revealthat many firms are in financial difficulties, several established importers  being  unable  to  meet  their  bills  and  asking  for extension.    In  the  Argentine  Italian competition continues  to  be
felt and during recent months they have  been liquidating stocks in auction at prices below manufacturing cost.    Trade in Chileon the other hand, continues to be satisfactory, stocks are going into consumption and sales have been good.   The fall inthe price of coffee has had a very serious effect on the trade of Brazil and Colombia.     Woollen and Worsteds.   The past month witnessed a slightrecovery Tn raw wool values, though at  the moment the volume ofturnover has shown little signs of expansion as the market isawaiting the developments in Australia and South Africa inregard to the restriction scheme in order to ascertain whetherthe present level is justified.   Some improvement was recorded in the yarn section, the hardening tendency in the raw materialmarket having induced several users to operate.   Enquiries fro-:.the Continent have been more numerous of late,  a few of whichhave already developed into firm orders  owing to the upwardtendency of prices.   In the piece goods section, buyers on homeand foreign account have operated with greater freedom, whilstit is anticipated that the improvement in demand will become more marked at an early date.     Coal.   The improvement in activity in the coal industry was generally maintained during the past month, though owing to theheavy imports towards the end of last year into the continent and Scandinavia, which resulted in an accumulation of stocks, theexport trade, especially in prompt delivery, has shown signs ofdecreased activity of late.   Shipments  from South Wales havebeen maintained on a substantial scale,  whilst the Northumberlandand Durham areas report that trade during January has been generally satisfactory to colleries and  merchants, shipmentshaving been substantial and prices more  remunerative.   demands for house coal have fallen off of late.    Supplies for industrial purposes have been, in good demand and enquiries are coming forward at a fairly fast rate.   The outlook for the coal industry at the moment is somewhat uncertain.     Iron and Steel.   The condition of  the Iron and Steel trade has been rather quieter during the past  month than towards theend of last year.   The buying has been on more cautious lines,attributable in part to the general uncertainty of the industrial position.   The principal works report that they are operating ona moderately full scale at the moment, but the lack of orderscoming forward to replace contracts which have been completed doesnot warrant an optimistic view with regard to the next few months.The demand for semi and finished steel has been poor, althoughprices were generally maintained.   The  tin-plate market continuesto be quiet, only a few firms reporting  substantial orders in hand.Those works engaged upon the supply of ship-building, railway andconstructional engineering material have substantial orders in handespecially those in the North East Coast area.    The sheet trade has been quiet in most centres.     Hardware and Cutlery.   The position of the cutlery trade has not been as favourable as it was this time last year.Enquiries and orders from abroad are at  a low level, whilst home trade business has been uncertain.   The raising of theAustralian tariff on electro-plated articles is&quot;causing considerable anxiety in the trade.   Manufacturers of hardware
)complain of a general lack of confidence among purchasers.Thero has been a general decline in demand on homo and foreignaccount.   Markets specialising in agricultural and gardenimplements are fairly busy.     Boots and Shoes,   Some falling off in activity In the bootand. shoe trade was registered during the month.   Output isbelow that for last year, whilst, trade is very unevenlydistributed over the various centres.     Chemicals,   There has been some slackening In the chemical industry during January, the demand reported as not being equalto the normal for this time of the year.   Business in heavychemicals is fairly satisfactory and prices generally steady.     MR. HAYHURST forwarded the following report -                       Co-operative Trade.     During tho month of January, brisk business w.s transactedin the various sections of my Society, the total sales recordedagain showing an increase over the figures for the correspondingmonth of 1929.   Sales to foreign countries also show an increase,whilst satisfactory business has been recorded in our 3anklngDepartment.   Spea :ing Generally, trade, both productive anddistributive, has followed its normal course.     Grocery and Provisions,, Butter. - It may be interesting torecor^&quot;^ITKat during the &quot;year&quot; 1929 Denmark imported into theUnited Kingdom 2,204,000 owts, of butter, representing 54;i ofour total imports of that particular commodity;  this is thehighest weight, recorded, and is an increase of 1).- over the year1928,   The maximum supply was 219,000 cwts. during- the month ofAugust.     With regard to the position of the Danish Market during themonth, I might say that, towards the close, an increased demand from continental countries, along with a better consumptiondemand on this side, hardened the market, with the result thatan advance of 5 Kroner was recorded, and. that indications pointed to a still further firming of the price.     New Zealand and Australian supplies have been somewhatunsettled during the past  two weeks or so, but towards the close of the month, the trade appeared to be moving in a more regularmanner at a reasonable level of prices.     Cheese. - Recent shipments of New Zealand make having founda ready clearance and a thin market operating owing to fog andslow deliveries, resulted in a firm and dear position beingcreated, but probably arrivals due in the early part of Februarywill ease the situation,   September make of Canadian cheese hasbeen perfect in quality, and with excellent value for money hasfound a good market.
     Sugar. - Throughout the month large sales have  beonrecorclea.   At one period it was felt that supplies  for thenoxt few months would be Likely to largely exceed requirements,and this prospect left a depressing effect on the market.  Atthe clo3e of the month, rumours of an agreement between Cubaand Java helped to strengthen the market, but a slight weaknessin American caused a steadier feeling on this sido.     Wheat. - During the month, the prices fluctuated in ,theusual manner, and on the month under review,  Liverpool FuturesMarket closed l/9d, Chicago 2/&apos;-, Winnipeg 4/-, and Argentina4-g-d, per quarter lower, and it may be taken that markets have largely reflooted the lack of demand and heavy stocks all  overtho world.   In the United States of America, strenuous efforts have been made to hold present prices, but the lack  of export demand did not encourage speculators to support themarket.     Canadian Wheat is gradually coming into  line with cthsrwheats, but exporters are still asking higher premiums thanbuyers are willing to pay.   The Canadian Government haveissued their January Report on the 1929 crop, and estimatetho yield at 299,520 bushols against thoir previous  estimateof 293,899,   It is stated that Australian wheat has been  putafloat unsold by the various pools which will have to be sold.     Flour. - Notwithstanding the firm following in  the wheatmarkeT,&quot; flour has been ruling somewhat unsettled, alternatingdaily betwoen weakness and firmness.   Some idea of  the enormous business done by our Flour Mills will be gatheredwhen I mention that our  sales from the Mills  for 12  months arenow in the neighbourhood of 4 million sacks of 280 lbs. each.     Bacon and Hams. - Fairly good demand in continental meatshelped&quot; to steady the market;  American meats  have been none  tooplentiful, with the result that Shippers havo been inclined to hold on to the better tone and higher prices recorded.     Tea, - The market opened in the New Year stillmaintaXhing the stronger tone which prevailed when it closed down for Christmas holidays,   Coironon and medium descriptions of Indian Tea shewed a further advance of about -Jd.  to fed,per lb, while other grades remained fully firm.   All gradescontinued to meet with general support throughout the wholemonth and  only whon quality was worse wa,3 there any  decline Inquotations.   Ceylon offerings at first were  generallyinferior In quality and made slightly lower quotations butthe market continued strong and active.   Good liquoring teawas keenly competed for all through the month and formed the strongest market.   These finer teas at this  time of yearbecome shorter in supply each week and rule firm tooccasionally dearer prices,   Medium descriptions were quotedfirm but plain and common were comewhat irregular andoccasionally ruled against the seller.   Leaf grades forexport found better support and Java and Sumatra met with  afair demand at slightly easier prices.   Reviewing the market   ;as a whole during the month it could be quoted generallysteady.
1     Coffee,  - The New Year opened with a  good demand  forCoataa &quot;and Kenyas of good or attractive quality  at  full to higher prices but the medium and lower grades were generallyneglected.   Columbians, Javas,  Mochas, and Honduras met witha slow sale,    A very noticeable feature of this  month&apos;ssales was tho attention given to Kenyas, the fine bold grades of which realised very steady and firm prices.   Medium tocommon were slow of sale, Tanganyika  and KIlimanajaro  typeswere In good demand but sold at  lower prices than Kenyas.     ,     Cocoa. - There has been very littlo movement or change in spotprices&quot; on the market and forward positions were firm in theearly part of the month but became Irregular at the  end.   Onthe West Coast the Farmers still held up their crops of cocoain all districts in the hope of  higher prices which  will quiteprobably materialise on account  of a  reduction In sea  freightswhich takes place this month enabling merchants,  selling onc.i,f. terms to increase prices  by the amount of  freightreduction.   Consequently there  has been little or no  movementthere but what little cocoa has  been  marked has fetched pricesabove Home Market quotations.     Chocolate. - After the great rush of  Christmas  orders,trade has returned to a normal level  - Export trade  has been rather more brisk.     Russian Business, - I append hereto copy of  a statement which was prepared a&quot;f^urtnlght ago, which  will indicate to you the enormous business which we are at present doing  withRussia,

SIR WOODMAN BUHBIDGE wrote:-Distributing; Trades.     January marks  the  end of the  second  half  of  the  financial Iyear, and the figures  to hand generally confirm the viewsthat have been expressed about conditions in the  distributive  Itrades.  The comment most frequently made is that the decrease!in turnover during the  second half year went far  to cancelling out the increase of up  to dfo which had been registered in  -the first half year, with the result that figures for thecomplete financial year were expected to  be approximately the same as for the year ending January Slst,  1929.     Taking into consideration all the adverse factors, suchas unseasonable weather, falling prices,  smaller  purchasingpower, and the disturbance to trade caused by the GeneralElection, combined with uncertainty as to future  taxation,this result must be regarded as satisfactory,  the more BO  as192S proved in many cases an exceptionally good year.     So far as January itself is concerned, the sales appearto have run more or less their normal course.  Generallyspeaking, they started well, but tailed  off towards  the end,when public interest became harder to stimulate.   The mildweather, mpreover, was unfavourable to the sale of heavyunderclothing, and similar merchandise.     Under these circumstances, it has not always been easy to detect any decided tendencies, and experience has  beenexceptionally varied.     Among the West End Stores, piece goods departmentsduring January were somewhat irregular but women&apos;s wear shows 1a good average increase of some 13fi.  Men&apos;s wear departmentsalso show no decided tendency, and the hardware departmentsshow wide varieties.  Boot and shoe and  furniture departments on the other hand, have had a good month, increasesaveraging 14$ and 9$ respectively.  Food departments  arealso some 6% up, while the increase in the miscellaneousdepartments average no less than 16%.  On the whole,  therefore1there has been no reason to complain of  the state of  trade.     Once again the experience has not been so good among thesuburban stores, and with figures generally difficult tomaintain, variations in turnover either  upwards or downwards  jhave not been substantial.  The piece-goods and women1s wear  jdepartments are, on the whole, slightly down, and falls inthe men&apos;s wear departments average some  10$.  The Boot andshoe departments have done better, but hardware is down someSfo, furniture is about level, as are also the miscellaneousdepartments.     The same remarks generally apply to the North.  Piece-goods departments are down some 10%, a number of smallvariations either way are shown in women&apos;s and men&apos;s  wear,but  the boot and shoe departments are generally up.  Theother  groups of departments show no decided tendency, although&apos;variations are insignificant.     From the south of England and Wales, in the piece-goods and women&apos;s departments, increases in turnover, are theexception and those reported are only of small extent.  i.ien&apos;
     SIR GUY GAANET, wrote:-                       Money  Market.     Monetary conditions have during the past month been much easier than is usually the case and It was not untilthe week commencing February 3rd that the supply of fundsat the disposal of the Money Market began to shorten,  theDiscount Market borrowing from the Bank of England onFebruary 6th for the first time this year.  It has beencustomary for money to become scarce about the third week in January, but the effect of the inflov of Revenue suchas Motor licence duties and the half yearly instalment of income tax, appears to have been offset by the rapid return of currency notes from circulation and large repayments of treasury bills by the Government. There has also been akeen Continental demand for Bank Bills, and funds haveflowed to this country from France and to a lesser degreefrom Holland, owing to the easy conditions ruling in thosecountries.     The Bank of England has also succeeded in maintaining the improvement in its gold position with which it commenced the year, the present stock of gold amounting to  151,000,000.A fortnight ago the Bank Rates of Paris and Berlin were reduced by one half per cent and this movement was followedby reductions in London and New York on Thursday February6th.  The prospect of the import of  7,000,0&quot;00 gold from australia and also possible imports from Spain coupled withthe easier outlook for World money conditions has evidentlyinfluenced the Court of the Bank of England to reduce their official discount rate which had for some weeks been over1% above the iviarket Discount rate.     On the whole the state of the foreign exchanges is not unsatisfactory and Berlin is the only centre in a positionto compete for whatever gold arrives in the open market,securing about  1,750,000 of the gold which arrived from south Africa and Spain during the week ending February 9th.The state of their exchange would not have justified theGermans paying more than 94s.lid. per fine ounce, but theBank of England did not compete and evidently expects to fulfil its requirements at its official buying price of84s.10d.  Also it is not expected that shipments to germany will cause embarrassment here.     The scarcity of Bank Bills together with the reducedofferings of Treasury Bills still keeps the Market Discountrate low, the ruling quotation for three months bills being3 7/8 - 315/16,  which is about ^fo below what the rate should normally be with a Bank Hate of 4%$.                         CONFIDENTIAL.                         ----wear is slightly up, and turnover in hoote and shoesabout level, but furniture has in most  oases had a much better sale.  Hardware has been slightly better, and somelarge increases are reported in the food and sportsdepartments;  the miscellaneous departments are about, level.
COOt-i V O   Generally speaking the present financial situation isdistinctly healthier than that of the final quarter oflast year.  In the Stock Exchange there has, since thebeginning of February, been a fairly good demand for investment stocks, which has encouraged various borrowersto invite the public to subscribe to loans of an investment character.  These offers met with varyingreceptions, underwriters had to take up if; of the central electricity Board issue of  7,000,000 5% Stock at 97&amp;and      of an issue of  1,100,000 Brighton Corporation5Jc Stock at 99&amp;.-     The above figures seem to indicate that the amount available for long term investment is rather limited,and that the Government^ recent Conversion Loan has toa certain sxtev t absorbed, a good proportion of suchfunds,   A short term offer in the nature of  6,000,000Government of India 6% Bonds at 99 repayable at par in1932 or at 101 in 1933, was, In view of the fact thatthe yield to maturity is nearly Qj&amp;j promptly over-subscribed on the 10th instant.     There is practically no speculation in either theStock or Commodity Markets at the present time largely due to the fact that the markets for such commodities as Cotton, &apos; ;heat, Coffee, Rubber and Wool, and various industries too well known to need recapitulation are suffering severely from over production and decliningworld prices.

     MR. HOSE SENT    THE FOLLOWING REPORT:-                       SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     During the past, month, there have been issued in Argentina the  second official estimates of the cereal and linseed crops.  In this report, the yield of wheat this season is estimated at 3,807,000 tons, against 3,897,000 tons forecast in December last and  a final estimate of the 1928-29 production of 8,365,000 tons. The total output of oats this season Is pieced at 972,000 tons, against 987,000 tons forecast in December and an estimated yield cf 945,000 tons a year ago, while the corresponding figures for linseed are 1,400,000 tons this season, against an&quot; earlier estimate of 1,413,000 tons and last Year&apos;s production of 2,103,000 tons. It will thus be seen that the current season&apos;s crop of wheat represents a reduction of as much as 54.5 per cent, on that of 1928-29, and that of linseed 33.4 per cent., while the increase in oats is only 2.9 per cent.  In addition, it is now believed thatmaize will not yield the bumper harvest which was previously expectation- ted.  At the same time, the low prices of cereals in the consumingmarkets also constitute an adverse factor, there having recently been more than one instance of vessels arriving in the River Plate being obliged to return to this country in ballast.     Since the suspension of the issue of gold against paper currency, the general commercial situation in Argentina has beenquiet.   In the markets for imported cotton and woollen textile goods,  the general tone is dull and sales show some contraction. It is to be feared that, at&quot; least during the next few months, importers will be disposed to restrict their commitments to aminimum, for since the issuing of the Decree to which I referred inmy last report to the Council, authorising the deposits of gold at certain of the Legations abroad against corresponding issues of paper currency in Argentina, the rate of exchange has declined sharply, and the current sterling value of the peso is not morethan 42 5/8d.   This rate compares with the parity of 47.58d,, and,while such a low dealing rate may to some extent be beneficial tothe exporter, it cannot but  tend to restrict imports and of course involves potential losses to all interests, such as the Britishrailway companies operating in Argentina, who, in the normal course of their business, have to provide for heavy remittances abroad.These effects o-fv the low exchange are in addition to the increased cost of the service of Argentina&apos;s external indebtedness.     Figures have been published of the export trade of Argentinaduring the first ten months  of 1929.  The total value of exports during the period is given at 840,315,369 pesos (gold), as compared with 900,707,&apos; 135 pesos in the corresponding months of 1928.There was thus a decrease of 60,391,766 pesos (gold), or approxi-mately 6.7 per cent.   The quantity of goods shipped, however, was greater than in 1929, at 14,799,675 tons, against 14,694,882 tons, an increase of 0.7 per cent.  The reduction in the aggregatevalue of exports was therefore due to the decline in prices duringthe year.
     In Chile,  it may be said that general commercialoonditiona are  now beginning definitely to reflect the progress and consolidation undertaken in both national finance andindustry during the past few years by the present Administration.Retail sales have recently shown a considerable Inorease on thoseof a year ago,  although some seasonal slackness has beenapparent in the wholesale trades.  Agricultural conditionscontinue favourable, and a satisfactory yield is expected fromthe next harvest.   Sales of textile goods have been rather slow,although some improvement has been noted in the demand for yarns.In certain lines, the manufacturing industries are experiencingsome reduction of output.     The strong position of the Chilean national finances is again.evidenced by the monthly returns of the Comptroller-General of the  Republic  The total ordinary revenue for thefirst eleven months of 1929, Including 43,006,015 pesosrepresenting the surplus brought in from the year 1928, was1,133,315,923 pesos, while expenditure aggregated 1,035,469,217pesos,  there being thus a surplus of revenue over expenditure of97,846,706 pesos.     Brazilian conditions are still characterised by acutecommercial depression, due primarily to the difficulties of thecoffee industry.  In this connection, it is noteworthy that special measures have latterly been undertaken to deal with the excess of stocks of coffee in the Interior by the substitution ofthe finer grades of coffee for stocks of lower qualities existing in Santos, the  recommencement of dealings at the official SantosOoffee Exchange, and by other means.  It is, of course,impossible to predict the course of events, but manifestly, inview of the paramount importance of coffee to Brazil - thesuccessful marketing of the product being the present basis ofthe country&apos;s economic fabric - the problem of the present coffeesituation must  be engaging the constant and expert attention ofthe many leading interests involved.  The importance ofmaintaining the credit of the country unimpaired may be &quot;gaugedby the fact that the interest remitted abroad annually on the government&apos;s external obligations is currently estimated at 35millions sterling.-  The latest available official statistics ofBrazilian foreign trade relate to the first ten months of 1929,and show that imports amounted to 2,979,092 contos ofcompared with 2;987,127 contos in the corresponding period of1928, while exports totalled 3,276,711 oontos, against5,327,296 contos.  It will thus be seen that the surplus of merchandise exports is maintained On a scale disproportionate toBrazil1s foreign loan commitments.     The Uruguayan wheat harvest has been completed, and it isexpected that the country&apos;s production of this cereal for thecurrent season will be normal.  Prospects for the disposal ofthe exportable  surplus of wheat are reported to be favourable,more especially in view of the big roduction  shown in theArgentine crop.   She Republic&apos;a national finances are maintained on a sound basis, but the trade outlook must be largely dependent upon the future level of prices for wool andcereals in the  consuming markets.
      Peruvian conditions continue to be dominated by the exchange position; apparently the Government is pursuing its avowed object of  stabilising the exchange at the equivalent of US^4 to the Peruvian pound.  In the meantime, the general commercial situation Is  depressed, and there is little optimism in regard to prospects. The Peruvian Government has already issued certain Decrees, among which may be mentioned that dated 14th December last, providing that  contracts, sales, and commercial operations contracted in Peru or having effect therein shall be made out in Peruvian currency. The difficulties attendant upon the application of this Decree have been ventilated by commercial and industrial interests, and further amending or explanatory Decrees are expected.     Retail business in Mexico is reported to be seasonally dull, despite the recent improvement in the general economic situation. As a result of the drop In silver prices, the Aiexican mining Industry is being seriously affected, and the curtailment of operations is anticipated.     Mail advices from Colombia indicate that towards the end of December last, coffee prices showed en appreciable recovery, which was maintained during the early pert of January.  Transport con- ditions on the River Magdalena are difficult, the present being the normal dry season.  Holiday requirements resulted in an improvement in the general demand for merchandise.  In view of the General Election -htich is no1-&apos; taking place, quiet commercial conditions are anticipated for the time being, but so soon as the elections are completed, some progress in the general situation may be expected.     Reports from the cocoa-producing centres of Ecuador continue to be very favourable, and there is considerable optimism regarding prospects for the new crop, provided dry hot weather is maintained.  Total entries of cocoa into the local market during the eleven months ended 30th November lt.-st.were 298,969 quintals, against 386,664 quintals in tho corresponding period of the pre- ceding year.  Prices in the overseas market have improved,  while local quotations are firm.  The quantity of cocoa arriving from the producing centres continues normal, end the demand for thi t commodity in the consuming markets is maintained on a  fv-irly profitable basis.     In Venezuela, the tone of the local coffee m.; market continued dull, although in some directions purchases have been made of high grade coffees in cover of forward sties.  In other instances, exporters show a disposition to remain out  of the market pending greater stebility In prices, while the coffee  producers are disposed to retain crops in the hope that higher valueswill be reached after the turn of the year.  For the time being, the demand for the commodity from the United States and Europe is poor.  Advices in regard to the cocoa crop are favourable.     General commercial prospects in Nicaragua are not entirely satisfactory, owing to the small demand for coffee, and the low level of prices for thrt commodity, factors v-hich indicate  a probable unfavourable trade balance.  The political situation, however, remains tranquil, and the basic economic conditions are sound.     The adverse factor of the decline in coffee prices has been particu lcrly marked in Salvador, end only in exception;;. 1 c a s e s can the coffee planters thore secure a reasonable margin of profit on their output.  It is possible that the Government may eventually have to permit a part of the export tax on coffee, although any such action -would involve an appreciable decline in revenue.
Stringency la in evidence in the credit situation, and farmers are experiencing difficulty in financing the movement of the crops.   At the same time, merchants in many cases are over-stocked and no recovery in the general situation can beanticipated until an improvement occurs in market conditions for coffee, which constitutes the country&apos;s principal exportproduct.
