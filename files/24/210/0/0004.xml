(THIS &quot;DOCUMENT lb THE PROPERTY OF HIb BRITANMIC MAJESTY&apos;b 00VERHM31CT) .   SECRET.                                            Copy Mo.C;P. 54(50)   GAB I MET.RURAi AMENITIEb BILL.Memorandum by Minister of Health.   1.   This Bill is the First Order for Friday next.        The object of the Bill ia to make further provisions for the preservation of rural amenities.   This it proposes todo by -Empowering town planning schemes to be made for aural areas.   Schemes have now in the main to be limited to &quot;land in the   course of development or likely to be used for building&quot;,   although, in fact, a good deal of rural land Is   incidentally included in some schemes:Empowering County Councils compulsorily to acquire land up to   220 yards on each side of a new road and providing  for the   inclusion of that land in a town planning scheme:Requiring County Councils or Joint Town Planning Committees to   make full surveys of their areas:Prohibiting the &quot;export of ancient buildings&quot; without  consent:Further control of advertisements and the registration of trees   to be preserveed and prohibition of their destruction without   consent:Prohibition of refuse dumps,  without the consent of the local   Authority of the district,  in areas outside that of the local   Authority disposing of it.        There are several other provisions including a highly controversial clause in regard to compensation (Clause 4).   2.   It will be seen that the   Bill  is  of wide  scope.   Thereis little  doubt that  it will gain a very large measure  of                             1.
idsupport.   It is backed by Members of all parties.   It willbe difficult to resist the Second Reading.        At the same time I feel that it is unfortunate that ameasure of this amplitude should be considered in committee on a Private member s Bill.   It will require avery great, deal of consideration and probably muchamendment, and the time of Parliament and of deparment is already fully occupied.        Moreover,  I contemplate introducing a town planning Bill next Session,  in accordance with the decisionalready given by the Cabinet (Cabinet Conclusions 45 (29),Conclusion 8), which would extend town planning powers to areas already developed as well as t o rural areas;  andoonferenoes to this end are now proceeding withrepresentatives of various interests.        It is doubtful whether the House will be inclined to refuse Second Reading to the present Bill on this account.Therefore, although there is little likelihood that the bill will have any chance of becoming law without Governmentfacilities,  and it seems little likely at present that these could be promised,  it appears that there is no alternative to supporting the Second Reading.                                   (Intld.) A.G.Ministry of Health,       Whitehall.  .17th February, 1930.
