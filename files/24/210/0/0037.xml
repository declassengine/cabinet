THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  March 1930.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.   63C.O.S. 224.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.PIRACY IN  CHINA  WATERS. (Previous Paper No. CCS.  223.)                                  REPORT.  .    AS directed by the Prime Minister, we have examined the  attached report bythe Oversea Defence Committee relative to the provision by the  naval and militaryauthorities of anti-piracy guards for shipping in China waters.    2.   On the question of principle, our views of a year ago, stated in paragraph 3of the attached report,  remain  unchanged.  We are still firmly convinced that no satisfactory action for the protection of vessels  against piracy is  possible  withoutthe whole-hearted co-operation of the shipowners, who must be made to assume full responsibility for the internal protection of their ships.    3.   The whole subject of piracy in China waters was so fully dealt with in our report of a year ago (C.I.D. Paper No. 330-C) that in the present paper we proposeto limit ourselves to an examination  of the conclusions submitted by the  OverseaDefence Committee in paragraph 16 of the attached report.  We will now consider these seriatim.    4.   &quot; (a) It is not for the Committee to suggest any  modification of the  cabinet decision to withdraw  regular naval and military guards on the 31st March.  If,howeiier, the continuance of  these guards for a further  definitely limited period isconsidered desirable, the Committee propose that it should be subject to the folloivingconditions:      (i)  That the Shipping Companies evolve an efficient scheme  and agree to bring          it into operation at the earliest possible date, this date to be fixed by the          1st April.    (ii)  That the full  cost of any naval  and military  guards supplied after the        .  2Ast March be borne by those Shipping Companies which employ them.&quot;    We are in complete agreement that it is for the Cabinet alone to decide whether any modification of their decision to withdraw the regular naval and military guardson the 31st March is desirable.    5.   We do not, however, agree  with the stipulation contained in (a) (i). that theShipping Companies should evolve the scheme. We consider that no better solutioncould be found  than an elaboration of the existing  scheme under  which Indianguards, organized under the Inspector-General of Police, Hong Kong, are available.    Experience has  shown that these guards, if properly employed, accommodated,itnd supervised, are capable of performing the duties required of them efficiently^.      [20762]                                                          B
     In this  connection,  we would mention  that the Commander-in-Chief, China, reported on the 17th January that the Indian guards on board during the piracy of the &quot; Haiching &quot; &quot; fully justified the reliance  which the Douglas Steamship Company put  in them, and it does not  appear that a  British guard of  equal numbers  could have done more.&quot;     Further, we understand  that  the Colonial  Government are quite willing to contimie this system.  It will,  of course, be necessary to make provision for depots of guards at places other than Hong Kong, such as Singapore and Shanghai.     6.  We fully agree with the stipulation contained in (a)  (ii) above that the full cost  of any naval and military guards supplied after the 31st March should be  borne by those Shipping Companies which employ them.  ^  &quot;(b) That any  practicable  scheme should   emanate   from  the  Shipping Companies, but the Committee suggest that, in order  to expedite  progress, His Majesty&apos;s Government might inform the ship owners, both in London and in  Hong Kong,  that they would be ivilling to advise  them, and  to consider favourably any application for the services of retired  naval and military officers and other ranks.&quot;     f.  If our  previous recommendation is accepted, consideration of conclusion (b) is unnecessary.     8.  &quot; (c) That any organization ivhich is  set up should ultimately be independent of the. Imperial and Colonial authorities, and that the w-hole. cost, including that of initiating the  scheme, should be borne  by the  Companies  in proportion to  their demands on it.&quot;     As already stated, we consider that the Colonial authorities should continue to assist in the  provision of Indian guards,  but we  fully agree that the whole cost ofthe elaborated  scheme, including that of maintaining the guards  when  on shore, should be borne by the Companies in proportion to their demands on it.                             CONCLUSIONS.9.   Our conclusions may be summed up as follows : (a)  If the continuance of the regular naval  and military guards for a further      definitely limited period is ordered by the Cabinet,  it should be subject      to the following conditions :        (i) That the  Shipping Companies agree, before the 1st April to  accept             an elaboration of the present scheme under which Indian guards             are made available by the Colonial Police  authorities for the             internal protection of shipping.      (ii) That any regular guards supplied after the 31st March should be paid             for in full by  the Shipping Companies.(b)  We consider that the whole cost of the elaborated scheme,  including that of      maintaining the Indian guards when not actually employed on board ship,      should be borne by the Companies in proportion&apos;to their demands on it.

SECRET.[No. O.D.G.  585-M.]ANNEXURE.COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.OVERSEA DEFENCE  COMMITTEE.                       Piracy in China  Waters.Memorandum by the Oversea Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.    THE  Colonial  Office have referred to  the Oversea Defence Committee forconsideration a telegram (Appendix), dated the 21st February, 1930, from the OfficerAdministering  the  Government of Hong Kong, dealing  with  the  question  of anti-piracy guards for shipping in China waters.    2.  The whole subject of piracy in  China waters was, at the instance of theChief of the Naval Staff, discussed by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee over a yearago,  and a report (C.I.D. Paper No.  330-C) was submitted to the Committee  ofImperial Defence.    3.  The conclusions of the Chiefs of Staff were as follows :     &quot; (a) We are convinced that no satisfactory action for the protection of vessels          against piracy is possible without the whole-hearted co-operation of the          shipowners.   This is at  present  lacking.  We therefore suggest that          pressure should be brought to  bear through the medium of the interested          parties,  or  by legislation, to  make the shipowners  responsible for the          protection of their  ships and passengers so long as it is within their          power to do so, and to cause them to implement as far as is practicable          those recommendations of the  Sunning Commission which concern them.          The following steps we consider to be of particular importance :-           (i) Improvement in the conditions of service in shipping companies so                  as  to attract the best  type of personnel.  An increase of British                  personnel in the complement of vessels appears to be desirable.          (ii) Fitting of protection to the bridge and other vital positions in the                  ship.          (iii) The employment of guards, which might be organized at other ports.                  besides Hong Kong, and which should be rendered as efficient  as                  possible.              We fully realise that these proposals are likely to be fought by the          companies on the grounds of  expense, and  also on the excuse that the          fitting of protection to the bridge, &amp;o, may contravene the Board  of          Trade regulations regarding auoess to boats.             1   (b)  We suggest that the compradore,  who is the keystone of the whole structure-          of shipping&apos;trade in China, should, if possible, be given a real interest  in          preventing pirates from coming on board. At the same time, it is realised          that steps likely to incur the hostility of the compradore might seriously          affect the companies&apos; interests.             In any case,&quot; a more rigid examination of passengers on embarkation          and during the voyage would appear worthy of consideration.     [20735]  [20762]                                                B 2
     (c) We agree that patrols by His Majesty&apos;s ships for the purpose of intercepting           pirates should continue so far as the strength of  the squadron in the           Far East allows.     (d) While recognizing that, for the present,  the provision  of regular naval and           military guards on board ship must  continue, we  strongly  recommend. :          that the shipping companies should be informed that the provision of           these guards will cease in one year&apos;s time, and that they will then have to           assume full responsibility for the  internal protection of their  ships.     (e) We suggest that the local authorities  should be  asked to consider how           co-operation in intelligence between  the  various  ports  of call can be           improved.     if) The root of piracy is firmly embedded in Chinese soil, and piracy can only           be effectively suppressed  by Chinese action  on shore.   We therefore           suggest  that strong representations  should be made to  the Nanking           Government, if possible jointly with other foreign Powers, with a view to           action being taken to this end.   We suggest that the question  of exacting           reparation for injury to British lives  or property should be considered.&quot;     4.  The above report was considered  by  the  Committee of  Imperial  Defence attheir 240th Meeting on the 8th March, 1929, and it was agreed    &quot; (a) To  recommend  to the Cabinet that  approval in principle should be  given           to the recommendations submitted by the Chiefs of Staff in paragraph           of their Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 330-C); and     (b) To recommend that the Admiralty should  be authorised  to instruct the Naval           Commander-in-Chief, China, that the Anti-Piracy  Committee at  Hong           Kong should proceed on the assumption that the policy recommended by           the Chiefs of Staff will be adopted in principle, and  should submit in due           course detailed proposals for giving effect to this policy.     (c) To take note that  the Foreign Office were prepared in principle to  make           representations  to the Chinese Government at Nanking, either on the           general question of piracy or in connection with each specific case, though           they were not optimistic as to the result.&quot;     5.  On Wednesday, the  13th March, 1929,  the Cabinet  approved  the recom-mendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence as set forth above (Cabinet 11 (29),Conclusion 8), and the necessary instructions were communicated forthwith to theNaval  Commander-in-Chief,  China, the Anti-Piracy Committee, Hong  Kong, andHis Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking.     As a result of these instructions, the Shipping Companies then enjoying theservices of regular naval and military guards  were informed that these guards wouldbe definitely withdrawn on the 31st March, 1930, and that after that date completeresponsibility for the internal protection of shipping against piratical attacks  mustbe assumed by them.     6.  Since the above decision was  communicated  to the  Shipping  Companiespersistent  representations  have  been  made  by  the shipowners to  bring about  a reversal of  the  Cabinet decision.  The valuable time expressly provided by HisMajesty&apos;s Government to enable the Shipping Companies to find a suitable substitute for the regular guards was thus lost, and the shipowners have  laid themselves opento the  accusation that they cherished the hope that inaction and procrastination in formulating a new scheme  for the  internal protection  of  shipping after the31st March next might result in the provision of regular guards being continued.Representations  by  the Naval  Commander-in-Chief,  China,  that  the shipping companies  would be  incurring  grave responsibilities  in not taking early steps toprovide against the position  which would arise on the withdrawal of the naval andmilitary guards appear to have had little effect until last month.     Apart from the princijDle that  the onus of providing adequate measures for theinternal defence of  their ships must rest with  the shipowners,  it should also be appreciated that the provision of anti-piracy guards in  the Far East has resulted inconsiderable disorganization of the  forces stationed there.  The Navy cannot providedetachments for  this- purpose without immobilising ships, while the training and efficiency  for war of military units are seriously  affected by the constant absence oflarge number of N.C.O.&apos;s and  men.
    9.  It was evident during the discussion that strong opposition would be offered to any general tax which would increase charges on shipping not interested in anti-piracy guards.    10.   The Officer Administering the Government of Hong Kong considered thescheme altogether too nebulous and too expensive to be undertaken at a moment&apos;notice, and it was represented to the deputation that the only scheme admitting ofprompt application was a  development of the former system  of  Indian Guards,possibly supplemented by white N.C.O.&apos;s.  It was left to the deputation to confer with the Inspector-General of Police, Hong Kong, with a view to evolving a practicalscheme at the earliest possible moment.    11.  No further information is yet available as to the result of the conference with the Inspector-General of Police, but the Oversea Defence Committee suggestthat unless very active steps are taken to press the Shipping Companies to evolve asatisfactory scheme and to implement it as soon as possible, a further long delay willoccur.  Whatever action may be taken now, however, the Committee are of opinionthat it will be  impossible for the  Shipping Companies  to  produce an efficientsubstitute for the present naval and military guards by the  1st April.    12.  In  view of the  above, the Oversea Defence  Committee feel  it their  duty to mention the forcible representations made to them to the effect that if advantageis taken of  the absence of guards to  undertake an intensive campaign of piracy aserious blow will be dealt to British trade in the Far East.    It is for the Cabinet to decide whether this  danger is of sufficient gravity tomerit any modification of their original decision.    The Committee, however, venture to recommend that if  it is decided to continuethe  provision of  regular naval and military guards, such continuance  should be fora definitely limited period, and should be on condition that the Shipping Companiesevolve an efficient scheme and agree to bring it into operation at the earliest possible date,  the latter  date to be fixed  by  the 1st April.   Furthermore,  the committee consider that if regular naval and military guards are extended after the 31st March,their full cost from the 1st April should be borne by those Shipping Companies whichemploy them.    13.  As  regards the details  of  a  scheme for the provision of guards by theShipping Companies,  the Oversea Defence Committee consider that  any  practicalscheme must emanate  from  the  Companies after they have reached agreementamongst themselves.  At  this juncture any detailed criticism of the proposals madeto the Officer Administering the Government of  Hong Kong up  to date  (videAppendix) would be of little value.    At the  same time, as the Companies cannot.be expected to have the organizingand administrative knowledge, and undoubtedly have not the facilities for recruit-ment which are available to Government institutions,  such as His Majesty-s forces and the Police, the Committee feel that it would expedite progress if the shipownerswere informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government are willing  to.advise them on  these    7.   As reported in the second paragraph of the attached telegram, representa-tions were made on the 13th February to the Officer Administering the Governmentof Hong Kong that he should receive a deputation for the purpose of considering a-scheme *for the formation of a special force to be created of good-class fighting menfrom India with an establishment of British or foreign N.C.O.&apos;s, the whole to forma separate unit  under  its own  Commanding Officer, and  placed  for  training and discipline under the Naval Commander-in-Chief or the General Officer Commanding.It was suggested that the cost should be met in the first instance by the Governmentof Hong Kong and recovered by a surcharge on  all  shipping visiting the port,assisted by a grant in  aid by His Majesty&apos;s Government  in the United  Kingdom,&apos;and a contribution from the Singapore Government and other unspecified sources.    8.   The Officer Administering the Government of Hong Kong reports  that, on receiving the deputation,  he found that the scheme had only been considered inbarest outline.  No idea of the cost had been obtained, nor did the details involvedseem to  have been considered.  The number of men required was  tentatively statedto be 400, with 35 white N.C.O.&apos;s and 4 white Headquarter Staff.
points, and to consider favourably any application for the services of retired navaland military officers and other ranks.    14.  The Committee suggest that,  since it has  been decided  that the internalprotection of ships against piracy is the responsibility of the Shipping Companies,any scheme which is evolved should be based on the following principles :     (a) That the organization set up should ultimately  be entirely independent of          the Imperial and Colonial authorities.    (b) That the whole cost, including that of initiating  the scheme, should be borne          by the Shipping Companies making use of the organization, and by them          alone, in proportion to their demands on it, the distribution of the cost          to be arranged amongst themselves.    15.  It should, perhaps, be pointed out that the scheme must  include provisionfor shipping which at present embarks regular guards  at places  other than Hong-Kong, such as Singapore and Shanghai.                                  CONCLUSIONS.    16.  The conclusions of the Oversea Defence  Committee  submitted for  con-sideration by the  Committee of Imperial Defence  may  be  briefly7  summarised asfollows :     (a) It is  not  for the Committee to  suggest any modification  of the  Cabinet          decision to withdraw regular naval  and military guards on the  31st          March.  If, however, the continuance  of these  guards for  a  further          definitely limited period is considered desirable, the Committee  propose          that it  should be subject to the following conditions :             (i) That the Shipping Companies evolve an efficient scheme  and agree                 to bring it into operation at the earliest possible date, this date to                 be fixed by the 1st April.           (ii) That the full cost of any  naval and  military guards supplied after                the  31st  March be borne  by those Shipping Companies which                 employ them.    (b) That any practicable scheme should emanate from the Shipping Companies,          but the Committee   suggest that, in order to expedite progress,  His          Majesty&apos;s Government might  inform the ship owners, both  in  London           and in Hong Kong,  that they would be  willing to advise them, and to          consider favourably  any application for the services of retired naval and          military officers and other ranks.    (c) That any organization  which is set up should ultimately be independent of          the Imperial and Colonial authorities, and that the whole cost, including          that of initiating the scheme,  should be  borne  by  the Companies in  pro-          portion to their demands on it.                         (Signed)       G.N. MACREADY, Secretary,                                                  Oversea Defence Committee.2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1.      March 10, 1930.
APPENDIX.   Telegram from the Officer Administering the Government of Hong Kong to the           Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated February 21, 1930. (Confidential.)     YOUR telegram of  1st February, Confidential :  Anti-piracy guards.   I invite reference to my despatch of 5th January,  1929,  Confidential. -.1 adhere to views expressed therein, and consider that shipping companies have not  taken  adequate steps in the meantime to provide against position which will arise on withdrawal of Naval and Military guards.   I  agree  generally  with  the views  expressed  in anti-piracy committee&apos;s  report of 2nd  July, and  Haiching piracy  has not. altered my views.   The attempt in that  case  was rendered possible by failure to secure certain opening by  which  pirates gained  access to grilled  area.   I agree with Ministers  views on this  piracy expressed in his despatch of 12th December (1789).     The shipping companies are at last alive to their  position, and I received  on 13th February a request to receive a deputation for the purpose of considering a scheme, then for  the first  time  put before this Government,  that  a special force should be created of good class fighting men  from India with an establishment  of British or foreign n.c.o&apos;s, the  whole  to  form  a  separate  unit  under  its- own commanding officer and placed for training and discipline under Naval Commander- in-Chief or G.O.C.,  the cost  to  be met in the first instance by this Government and  recovered by  a  surcharge on all  shipping  visiting the Port, assisted by  a grant-in-aid from the Imperial Government and a contribution from the Singapore Government and other unspecified sources.    I received the deputation on the 17th February and  found that  the scheme had only been considered in barest outline.  No idea of the cost had been obtained, nor did the details involved seem to have been considered. The number of men required was tentatively put at 400, with 35 white n.c.o.&apos;s and 4 white  headquarter  staff.  It was pointed out that if all shipping were taxed, all shipping passing through pirate zone would be likely to demand guards and 400 might prove insufficient..  I declined to commit this Government  to the expense of establishing such an organisation  on the chance of recovering its cost later on without the fullest consideration.  It became evident in  the course of  the discussion  that strong  opposition might be- obtaining to any tax  which would increase charges on shipping not interested in anti-piracy guards. I am of opinion that the scheme is altogether too nebulous and too expensive to be undertaken at a momenfs notice.   I pressed on the deputation the view that only scheme admitting  of  prompt application was  a development  of the  former system of Indian  guards, possibly supplemented by  white n.c.o.&apos;s, and it  was left to deputation to confer with Inspector-General of Police, who was present at the discussion, with a view to evolving a practical scheme at the earliest possible moment. I consider that shipping utilising guards must bear the cost of the scheme.    Even this scheme will take time to evolve, but it seems to offer only practical solution to difficulty in which shipping companies now find themselves.  It may even be possible to develop  scheme in time into a permanent force on the  lines suggested by shipping companies, but  I am  myself doubtful if this will be found necessary. The possibility of utilising Weihaiwei Police Force on rendition of Weihaiwei was mentioned,  but  I am without  information as to when the  force  might  become available.    There remains the question of what  is to be done  between the 1st  April and time when Indian guards can be supplied in sufficient numbers.  To meet this difficulty I can only suggest that if, as Ministers  despatch No. 1789 implies,  it will  still be possible to supply military guards, these should be continued  but only on paymentof full cost (see paragraph  5 of enclosure  3 to my  despatch  of the 5th January, 1929).  It might well be disastrous  to allow  period to intervene without guards, and cost of military guard would be strong incentive to shipping companies to expediteless costly measure.
