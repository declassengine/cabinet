   [This Document is the Property of His  Britannic  Majesty&apos;s  Government.]                     Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1930.SECRET.   CP. 60 (30).                                                            O ^                                  CABINETSale of Arms and Ammunition to  Afghanistan.       MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR INDIA.   I invite a reference to Cabinet Minutes Nos. 47 (29) of 13th November, conclusion 9,and  53 (29)  of  17th December 1929,  conclusion  6  (b).   In the first  of these  theCabinet took note that the sale or gift of arms to King Nadir of Afghanistan was  notin conflict with their  previous decisions  on  the  subject  of  the sale  of arms andammunition to foreign States, and  in  the second they agreed that the decision not to dispose of surplus munitions  and arms to foreign Governments should not debara gift  by the Government  of India to Afghanistan.  It appears probable that  theAfghan Minister in London may sbortty ask for facilities to purchase from War Officesurplus stocks and to export to Afghanistan the whole or a part  of a consignment of50,000 rifles and  50,000,000 cartridges  for which  an English firm, Messrs. Fleming,were in negotiations  with  the  War  Office  in  1928  under instructions from  theformer &quot;Afghan  Government.  Messrs.  Fleming had in 1928  applied  for an export licence, and it had been agreed that this might be granted, but the matter lapsed atthe time of the fall of King Amanullah&apos;s Government.   Messrs. Fleming have recently.informed  the  War Office that they expect to  receive instructions from the  AfghanMinister in London to negotiate the purchase of a portion, at any rate, of the  originalconsignment.   Having regard to the decision of  the Cabinet on 13th  November, it  appearsdesirable that the War  Office should be authorised to supply the arms and ammunitionwhich  the Afghan Government desire to acquire, and that the Board of Trade shouldbe  authorised to grant the  necessary export  licence.  It  has been ascertained fromthe Government of India that they see  no  objection to the  grant of facilities to  theAfghan Government  to import the arms in question via India, as provided for in  theAnglo-Afghan Treaty, 1921.   They believe the Afghan Government to be in  need ofthem, and consider that it is  in our interest that the first consignment should  reach the new Government without delay.                                                                     W. B.    28th February 1930.4351    75  2.30
