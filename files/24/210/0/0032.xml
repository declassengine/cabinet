CP.82(30).                      CABINET.              TRAINING CENTRES AND AGRICULTURE.              Memorandum by  the Minister  of  Labour.     At the last meeting of the Cabinet we  were asked to&apos; considerwhether there were any means,  within tho scope  of our departments&apos;activities, of giving seme assistance to the  agricultural industry.In accordance with this ryquest I submit for  the consideration ofmy colleagues a suggestion which, while it  is of no greatmagnitude or importance, may prove on examination to be of practical value if it Is c^-ordinated with  larger prepcsals Inthe samo field.     The device of the Transfer Instructienal Centre for bringing into a more employable condition men suffering from the effects of unemployment could be used for reclaiming either by means ofdraining, or by repeated tillage, or by both, land which atpresent is not cultivated.   Centres of this typo have a large quantity of labour available which could be used to bring landin to a good state of cultivation.   Whether it would then be economically profitable to cultivate it is, of course, another matter.     It would be possible also for the Ministry of Labour, inconnection with some of its Handymen Training Centres, to do acertain amount of building of rural cottages or of farm buildingsas part of the course of instruction, without increasing verymaterially the standard cost of running such centres.                                                      /Only
     Only experiment can show to what extent or with whatsuccess either scheme could he adopted.   There is Crownproperty, for example, near Brandon in Norfolk1, where theMinistry of Labour already have a Training Centre, whichwould be suitable for experiments both in the tillage ofland which has gone out of cultivation and in reclamation ofagricultural land by drainage in the valley of the LittleOuse.(Intd0)   M.G.B.Ministry of Labour.7th March,  1930.
