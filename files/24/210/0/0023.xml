Copy  No.  JMSECRET.                  VOLUNTARY  SCHOOLS.               &quot;CTPT&apos;7 3/30.m---- ^g QRANgU^ by the&apos; PRESIDENT of  the BOARD.CP EDUCATION.                                                           i                In the  last  few months I  have been trying  by  private      conference to find an  agreed solution for the present diffi-      culties in relation to Voluntary Schools.   My colleagues will      realise that the  present  situation  has become acute, in the      first  place, because of the  insistent demand of the  Catholic      Hierarchy for building grants on the widest general  scale.      Many of the members of our Party during the election went a      long way in promising  help to the Denominations.  . The  Party    - policy was clearly laid down before the Election.   It was then      stated that the Minister of  Education would facilitate the      summoning of a Conference, if requested,  representative of the      Board  of Education, the Local Education Authorities, and the      various interests affected and would only act either by      legislation or regulation after agreement, had been reached.                In the  second place, there is a real need, from the      point  of view of  the children, to bring the voluntary schools      into the arrangements  for reorganisation which are going on      all over the country.    The  creation of senior schools, the      alteration of existing schools to accommodate another year of      child  life,  and to provide smaller classes and advanced scientific      or manual work requires a considerable building programme which      cannot be completed unless the Voluntary Schools play their part.                In many- parts of the country the Church of England is      sincerely trying to bring its scnools up to the required      standard or to enter into arrangements to send their older      children to senior Council Schools.   But the Catholics hitherto      in most parts of the country have withheld their&apos; co-operation.
          I have made no attempt to  find a solution of the TholeVoluntary School question.    That can come,  if it comes at all;only by gradual evolution./   I have  confined my exploration tothe problem of enabling Voluntary Schools to play their partin the present national reorganisation.    If they are notenabled to do so&apos;,  it will mean the penalizing of hundreds of thousands of children by inferior conditions or theburdening of the rates and  taxes for extensive building of   new   senior schools by the Local Education Authorities.          I have regarded it as quite impossible even to considerpublic assistance in respect of the  buildings of voluntary schools unless accompanied  by the concession of more publiccontrol by the Voluntary Managers.          Prom the Archbishop of Canterbury, acting on behalfof the Church Authorities and the Executive of the NationalSociety, I received proposals for an accommodation which are attached in an Appendix.   They represented, as it appeared tome, a genuine effort to work with the Education Authorities anda genuine concession to public control in return for assistanceout of public funds.          With these proposals I approached in turn:-       Representatives of the &quot;Free Churches,       The Executive of the national Union of Teachers,       The Catholic Hierarchy,       Representatives of the Local  Authorities.The opinion of the Free Church representatives was divided.Some thought the proposals  acceptable.   But several mostimportant Leaders adopted the attitude that the proposals,maintained religious tests,  while giving State support to thebuilding of Voluntary Schools.          The National Union of Teachers emphatically objected to the right of entry on any terms.    They alsc insisted thattests ought to be abolished altogether.                                2.
          The Local Authorities have so far not &apos; expressed aoollective view.    But  I have  reason to think that they wouldnot be hostile.          The catholic  Hierarchy appear to be willing to acceptthe proposals if  they cannot get more.          It will be  very  difficult to get complete agreement among all the chief interests.   But I should feel nays elf ina stronger position to  try to  obtain it if I could put -forward proposals whioh I could say the Government thought reasonable.The solution I suggest  is  a modification in some respects1 ofthe Archbishop&apos;s  proposals.    It is in its central featuressimilar to the solution which  is working with success in thecase of the catholic  schools in Scotland.                        PROPOSALS..         (1)    The  Local Education Authority should be entitled            to spend  public money on the repair, improvement or            snlargement of existing Voluntary Schools where such            works are required for purposes of a programme of            reorganization, wherever an agreement is arrived at            between the Local  Education Authority and the         .  -Managers.          [it should  be observed that I do not propose grantsas. permissible for  entirely new schools.   While this willcontinue to be urgently demanded by the Catholics, it would be opposed by the Pree Churcnmen.]         (2)   where  any such  grant is given the teachers must             become the salaried servants of the Local Lducation             Authority  and be  appointed .by them and  removable             by them.         (3)..   But the Managers may  retain the right of being-             consulted  and satisfied  that some or all of the             teachers are willing  and  competent to give             denominationa 1 instruc tion.
        (4)    Agreement must &quot;be  reached at the time when the           arrangement  is  made &quot;between the Local Education           Authority and the Llanagers as  to how many teachers           should be liable to this  denominational           requirement ,  due regard being  had to the approximate           sizes of the  groups of children in the school           belonging  and  not belonging to the denomination.          [The object of this is that if  half the children ina church school came from  Nonconformist families half the teachers might be free  of  tests , but if all the children wereCatholics in a school it would be open to the managersto require that the Local  j duc at ion-Authority should provide them, as they do  in Scotland, with Catholic teachers.   Infact, the object  is to make teachers public servants, to eliminate religious tests  altogether in some cases, and toleave it to  the good sense of the Local Education Authoritiesand Managers to carry out  the appointment of teachers with due regard to the existing denominational character of theschool., ]        (5)    No  teacher shall be dismissed except by the Local          Education Authority.   But the kanagers may ask the          Local  Education Authority to remove a teacher on the          ground that, having been appointed to give religious           instruction, he had   failed to give such instruction           efficiently and suitably.  - In case of a difference          which cannot be settled between the Local Education          Authority ana the managers, it shall be referred to           the Board of Education for decision,        (6)    in the case  of children transferred from a           Voluntary School to a Senior Council School, provision          may be made  on  two days in the week, There the desire           is expressed by the parents , for those transferred
        children alone to have special religious instruction        provided for them by instructors coming from .without,        but no teacher in the school shall be asked to give        such special instruction.    Conversely,  where  children        are transferred from a Council Sohool to a        Senior Voluntary School,  parents may ask for outside        Instructors in accordance with an authorised syllabus        of the Local Education Authority,     [The Teachers feel very strongly indeed the objection toany teachers in Provided Schools  being even asked to give special religious instruction voluntarily.   They are  afraid that it would indirectly result in tests being applied inorder to get willing teachers in  the schools.]          I commend these proposals to my colleagxies on theground that they do not impose a  settlement either on  LocalEducation Authorities or Managers  but leave individual authorities free to proceed by voluntary agreement withManagers,  and because they initiate a further step in  the.-direction of public control since  the teachers in the  voluntary schools affected will for the first time be appointed  by theLocal Education Authorities,  primarily on educational  groundswith denominational qualifications only as a secondaryconsideration.          I suggest that if the Cabinet are prepared to go forward on these lines it would be advisable:  -   (l) To consult again with the  representative  Bodies,  with       whom I have been already in contact,  in order to obtain       any further observations which they may have on these       modified proposals; at the  same time suggesting to them       that all parties should, in the interests of the nation       and of the children, be ready to enter into such an       accommodation.   The Cabinet might like,  for this purpose,
          -to appoint  a&apos; Sub-Comma.ttee  to -work with myself.      (2) a?o prepare  d White Paper  explaining  the policy and&apos;          implications&quot;.          If the general reception  in the Pfess  and elsewherewere favourable, the  sooner the  House of Commons could debate the matter the better, as at this &quot;moment &amp;11 sections of theHoude seem to be vefy anxious  for some kind of settlement.C.T.3rd March,  1930.
