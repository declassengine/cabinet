DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CRET. .  66 (50).COPY NO                CAB I NET.COMMITTEE ON THE ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR PUBLIC                  &apos;PURPOSES.(Note by the Lord President of the Council).1.        On the 11th December last the Cabinet had beforethem my Note (paper CP.  354 (29)) covering the Report of aSub-Committee of Officials appointed by the Cabinet Committeeon the Acquisition of Land for Public Purposes, and approvedmy recommendation that this Report SHOULD be submitted to theDepartments interested in order that the suggestions contained;in it might be carefully considered.2.        I have already indicated to the Cabinet my approvalof the main principles of the Report which will be foundsummarised on page 8 of the print,   In effect, theCommittee reached the conclusion that, while there are no sufficient reasons of practical advantage for providing morespeedy machinery for the acquisition of land by GovernmentDepartments, there is a case for expediting the compulsory acquisition of land by Local Authorities.    The Committeeindicated in general terms the nature and scope of thelegislation which would be required, at the same time addinga warning as to the expediency of introducing legislation ofthis character at a time when the alleged increase of thepowers of Government Departments is being subjected to so much criticism.3.        The observations of the interested Departments havenow been received and show that the findings of the Committee
meet with, general acceptance.    At my request the bub-Committee of Officials have examined the Departmental observa-tionSo   As will oe seen from the attached Report of thatSub-Committee, the only new point to which I need draw theattention of my colleagues is the suggestion made &quot;by the WarOffice and the General Post Office that some provision shouldbe inserted in any legislation conferring compulsory powersof acquisition of land on Local Authorities to secure that land already owned by a Department should not he acquiredcompulsorily by a Local Authority, without the express consentof that Department.4,        I agree with the view of the Sub-Committee thatthis requirement night be met by a provision to the effectthat where any Order for the compulsory acquisition of landaffects any land owned by a Government Department, the order shall not be confirmed except after consultation with theDepartment concerned.5.        It will be observed that the Secretary of State forScotland did not consider it necessary to appoint a specialCommittee to examine the Scottish aspects of the question.The Scottish Departments concerned have, however, consideredthe Report of the Committee and I attach a Memorandum givingthe results of this consideration.   It may be noted that inthe view of these Departments no amendment of the existing law regarding the acquisition of land by GovernmentDepartments in Scotland is required, and they agree withthe Committee that the inclusion in a Bill of such provisions would be inexpedient.   As regards the compulsorjr acquisitionof land by Local Authorities, the Scottish Departments areunaware of any serious difficulties experienced by LocalAuthorities in Scotland through inadequacy of their powers,but add that if legislation giving additional powers to Local
Authorities is introduced for England and v/ales, the questionof extending those powers, so far as necessary, to scotland would require further consideration.,6.        I now invite the Cabinet to decide:-  -         &apos;     (l)  Whether it is expedient that a Bill on the           subject of the acquisition of land for public           purposes should be drafted for further consideration,     (2)  If the answer to (l) is in the affirmative, whether,           as suggested by the Committee, the legislation           should be restricted to expediting the compulsory           acquisition of land by local Authorities on the           lines indicated in (2) to (?) inclusive of Section           III of the Report (A0L, (29) (4) ) annexed to           CO P.  354 (29) with the addition of the provision           mentioned in paragraph 4 above,7,        If the Cabinet agree to proceed on these lines,I suggest that the Minister of Health should be invited toarrange for the preparation of a draft Bill in  consultationwith the Secretary of State for Scotland for the considera-tion in due course of the Home Affairs Committee,                        (Signed)    PARMOOR.February, 1930,

PURTHER REPORT OF SUB - COMMIT TEE PIT DrgTp AR T ivCE NT AL OBSERVATIONS.    1.         In pursuanae of Cabinet 52(29) Conclusion 7 the    observations of the Departments concerned have teen obtained    en  the Sub-committee Report dated 27th November 1929.    (A.L.( 29) 4) .    &apos;2.         The Admiralty,  Office of Works and Forestry Commission    have  no  observations to effer.   The Air Ministry concur    generally in the Report and in particular support the    suggestion for empowering Local Authorities to acquire land    eompulscrily for the establishment of municipal or similar    aero drome s.    3.         The Secretary of State for Scotland did not    consider it necessary tn appoint a special Committee to    examine  the Scottish aspects of the matter, but these aspects    have  been the subject of inter-departmental consideration.              The Scottish Departments concur in the finding  of    the Report that it would be inexpedient to include in a    Bill any prrvision for more  speedy machinery for the acquisition    of land by Government Departments.              As regards the acquisition of land by Scottish  Local    Authorities, the general view of the Scottish Departments is    that the necessity for further powers  in  Scotland is net  of    itself sufficient to justify the attempt  to pass controversial    legislation on the lines suggested.    The Scottish Local    Authorities have not experienced serious  difficulty  through    inadequacy of their powers for acquiring  land compulsorily.   If    however, legislation is promoted in England, the Scottish    Departments would like to  consider further the  question  of the    extension  of such legislation to Scotland.                                  -1-
4.        The War Office and the General Post Office suggest,in effect, that some provision should he inserted in any legislation conferring compulsory powers of acquisition ofland on local Authorities to secure that land already owned by a Department should not be acquired compulsorily by a LocalAuthority without the express consent of that Department.  TheSub-Co:anittee agree that this requirement might be met by aprovision to the effect that where any order for the compulsory acquisition of land a:.fects any land owned by a GovernmentDepartment the order shall not be confirmed e::cept afterconsultation with the Department concerned.5.        The War Office also raise the question of theamendment of the provision of the Defence Act of 1342,under which a Certificate by the lord Lieutenant of the Countyin which lands are situated, or of two Deputy Lieutenants thatit is necessary or expedient for lands to be taken by the &quot;JarDepartment, is essential.    The matter is not, however, thecause of sufficient inconvenience for the Army Council to propose that any amendment should be made to the Act unless itis decided to include in a Dill provision for more speeds?-machinery for the acquisition of land by Government Departments                         Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee                                    I.
