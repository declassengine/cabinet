99QU io oTHIS PXDCUMEHT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITAFNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.      SECRET.                                                7  (f      CP.  85(30 )                       CABINET.             &apos;            UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE.       Memorandum by the Mini at er of  Labour.         The phenomenally large number of unemployed persons on the live register makes it necessary that Ishould bring urgently before my colleagues the presentposition of the finances of the Unemployment Fund.            The position is as follows:-    Maximum borrowing powers...............  40,000,000    Amount borrowed........................  37,290,000    Leaving available at the moment........   2, 710,000    Interest payable on 31st March.........     910,000             Leaving net...................   1,800,000          The last figure published for the live registerwas 1,539,000 and yet another increase will be announcednext week.   The new total is 150,000 more than thecorresponding figure for last year (which was temporarilyinflated owing to the frost) and 400,000 more than thecorresponding figure for each-of the  preceding three years.Moreover, the new Unemployment Insurance Act, which comes into force on 13th March is likely to cause a further substantial increase in the register./The
      The present revenue of the Unemployment Fund will cover only a live register of about 1,240,000.   As theChancellor of the Sxohequer^v*c^I told the Cabinet last october in connection with the Unemployment Insurance Bill,its finance was of an exiguous character and it waspointed out that further emergency legislation might be unavoidable  in order to ensure continued payment of benefitWith the figures above quoted, it is obvious that theresources of the Unemployment Fund will be exhaustedwithin a few weeks.   Close calculations cannot be made,but the position is that I have no assurance of being ableto carry on beyond Easter.      If there, is a further substantial increase in the register, I may not even beable to carry on till then.         This means that a Bill making some further financial provision of substantial amount must be passed before the Budget date.   I am in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer with regard to the preciseproposals to be made and I hope to bring them before theCabinet at their meeting on the 19th March.   My objectat present is to let my colleagues know the position andthe need for immediate legislation.                               (Intd. )  M.G.B.Ministry of Labour.8th March, 1930.
