REPORT.I. INTRODUCTORY.           (a.) Composition  and Terms of Reference.   1.  ON the 5th April,  1929, the Prime Minister (Mr. Baldwin)appointed  a Sub-Committee of the  Committee of Civil Research, *with the following Terms  of Reference :       To  examine and report on the economic aspects of proposals   for the construction of a Channel Tunnel or other new  form of   cross-Channel  communication.   2.  The Sub-Committee is composed as follows : E. R. Peacock, Esq. (Chairman).The Right Hon. Lord Ebbisham of Cobham, G.B.E.Sir Clement D. M. Hindley, K.C.I.E.Sir Frederick W. Lewis, Bt.Sir Henry Strakosch, G.B.E.  T.  Jones,  Esq.,  C.H.,  Secretary,   3.  On the 12th April, 1929, we held a preliminary meeting forthe purpose of laying down the procedure to be adopted  in our inquiry.   We  decided  to pursue concurrently our examination  of proposals  for a Channel Tunnel and those for other new forms  ofcross-Channel communication.  As regards the latter, some schemes,notably those  for  Channel Ferries,  were immediately  brought  toour attention.   Others were submitted to us at later stages of our inquiry.   In each  ease we studied carefully the  material placed  a tour disposal,  and, where  it  appeared to  us  desirable,  obtainedreports thereon from our advisers.   4.  As regards the proposals for a Channel Tunnel,  we decidedto obtain,  in the first instance,  from the Departments of State such information  as  was available from official sources.  Thereafter we obtained evidence  from the  Channel  Tunnel Company regardingthe nature  of  their  scheme  (paragraphs  45-47)  and from  the unofficial Channel  Tunnel Parliamentary Committee, which, underthe Chairmanship  of  Sir  William Bull, had  done  much to bring their proposals  to public attention.   5.  At the same period we received preliminary evidence on the geological aspects of the question and on the engineering and othertechnical problems involved.   On this side of  our inquiry, we had anticipated that a  large amount of data would be readily available,having regard to the number of years during which proposals for aChannel Tunnel have been under discussion.  We found,  however,that this was not the case.   It  appears that the  promoters in thiscountry and in  France did not feel justified in incurring any further expenditure  on exploratory work after the decision in 1883 by her majesty&apos;s Government to withhold, on military  grounds, their authority  for the scheme to proceed.  As a result, the informationplaced at  our disposal  was neither full nor conclusive and many ofthe estimates submitted necessarily lacked detailed confirmation.   6.  For  the purpose of  our inquiry it was,  however, essentialthat we should obtain adequate material  with  which  to satisfyourselves  on the question whether the geological conditions of thebed of the Channel were such as would render it physically possibleto construct a  Tunnel; if so, whether  the engineering difficultieslikely  to  be  encountered  were such  as might  reasonably  beanticipated.it would be possible to overcome; and  assuming that the answers to the  foregoing  questions were in the  affirmative, whatwould be the probable  cost of constructing and operating a Tunnel.    * NOTE. By Treasury Minute  elated January 27,  1930,  the  Committeeof .Civil Research was absorbed in the Economic Advisory Council, of whichthis Sub-Committee became a Committee.A.  F.  Hemming,   Esq.,  C.B.E.,  Assistant Secretary to the  Econo-  mic Advisory CouncilEconomic Advisory CouncilJoint Secretaries     to  the Sub-Committee.(b.)  Procedure adopted by the Committee.
   7.  On the answer to the last of these questions must dependany conclusions on the question whether a Tunnel might be expectedto compete effectively for traffic with existing routes, at reasonablerates, having regard to the heavy standing charges which it  wouldhave to meet.  The eminent engineers and contractors who appeared before us were not in a position to do more than express their individual opinions on these questions; and it soon became apparent that  reliable  answers thereto  could only  be obtained  after  aconsiderable amount of  detailed and expert investigation.  Suchinvestigations would entail substantial expenditure  which no witnesscould reasonably be expected  himself to incur for the benefit of our inquiry.   We  therefore concluded that the only  means by  whichwe could  secure information  on these matters would be  for  HisMajesty&apos;s Government  to arrange  for  a Eeport  thereon  to  beobtained  from a firm or firms  of Consulting Engineers.   8.  We recommended that the Consulting Engineers should beasked        (1.) To examine and report on the scheme put forward by   the Channel Tunnel Company for a railway connection between   the Southern Eailway and  the Chemins de Per du Nord under the   Channel.   The  examination desired is of  a general  character,   and only sufficient to  enable the  consulting engineers to express   an opinion on the following questions : -       (a.) Is a Channel  Tunnel feasible from the point of view               (i) of construction and maintenance?             (ii) of operation?       (ib.) Is  a pilot tunnel  necessary or advisable,  and how long   would it take to construct?              (i) Is further   exploratory work  required   before                    beginning work on the pilot tunnel?             (ii) If so, what further work should be done, how long                    would it  take,  and  approximately how much                    would it  cost?       (c.) If and  when a pilot tunnel had been successfully  made,   would it  be possible to  estimate for  the main tunnel, with   reasonable certainty as to  time, cost, and any unusual difficulties   to be overcome?       (d.) (i.) The Promoters and the Southern Eailway Company   suggest that  5,000,000 would cover  the  cost  of constructing a   pilot tunnel with a diameter of 10 feet, and  25,000,000 that of   two traffic tunnels with a diameter of  18 feet 6 inches, of a total   length of 34 miles*  (including 12 miles  of approach tunnels).   This  estimate   does   not  include provision  for  the  cost of   constructing the exchange  stations at each end of the Tunnel or   the cost of the  electric locomotives.          Are you able   to say that this is a  not unreasonable       estimate?       (ii.) The Chemin  de Per du Nord  have informed us that, in   their  view,  if  the Pougerolles, or some  similar, method were   successfully adopted for disposing of the excavated material, the    cost of constructing the traffic tunnels would be reduced to (say)    18,000,000, and the period of construction to five years from   the date on which work on them  was started.          Do  you   consider this system to be a practical one  and       these estimates to  be well founded?       (iii.)  The Promoters allow the sum of  1,000,000 per annum   for the operation and upkeep of the Tunnel.          Assuming that the rolling-stock and electric locomotives       will be  owned  and maintained by the operating  Eailway       companies,  is this sum, in your view, sufficient to cover all       costs under  this head?* This length should be 36 miles.
      (e.) How many men per annum would probably be employed   (a) directly and (b) indirectly in the construction of the pilot and   main tunnels, respectively?      (2.) To report generally on the problems connected with the   interchange of  rolling-stock  between  the  railways of Great   Britain and those of the continent, both for goods and passenger   traffic.   9.  We felt that it would be invidious  to invite any  one firm of consulting Engineers to express a definite opinion on the foregoingquestions, in view of the  complexity of  the problems involved andthe very large sums of capital that would be at stake.  We therefore recommended that the task of preparing  the proposed Beport shouldbe entrusted to a panel composed of the following firms of consulting engineers :  Messrs.  Livesey,  Son and  Henderson,  Messrs.  Mott,Hay and Anderson, and  Messrs. Rendel,  Palmer and  Tritton.   10.  Our  recommendations were accepted by  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and on the 6th December,  1929, we received a Beportsigned by the firms named above.  This Beport, which has proved of very great value to us, is reproduced as Appendix I to our Beport.   11.  On the subject  of the traffic prospects of a Channel Tunnelwe obtained  evidence  from  the railway companies  directly  or indirectly interested in  the  proposal.    The  Companies  directly affected are the  Southern Railway of this  country and  the Cheminde Per  du Nord of Prance.  We also received  information  on anumber  of  points  from  the  Secretary of the Railway  ResearchService.   We obtained  evidence  from  the Air Ministry regardingthe growth of air travel  between this country and the Continent.   12.   We  also took steps to inform ourselves of  the  effect whichthe construction of a Tunnel might be expected to have on employ-ment in this country.    As regards its  effect on agriculture,  we received  evidence  from the Minister  of Agriculture and Fisheries.We had also the benefit of the views of the  National Farmers&apos; Union.Turning to  the probable  effect of a Tunnel on manufacturing and trading interests,  we invoked the assistance of leading representa-tive bodies and  directly or indirectly consulted a large number  ofChambers of Commerce.  As regards Channel shipping,  we obtainedevidence from the Chamber of Shipping  of the United Kingdom.We  also took steps to obtain the  views of bodies such as the Doverand Folkestone Harbour Boards, the revenue of  which might  beexpected to  suffer as the result  of the construction of a Tunnel.Finally, two witnesses appeared before us to give evidence on certainsocial and other indirect effects which they feared might follow theconstruction of a Channel Tunnel.    13.   We  held twenty-five meetings for  the  purpose  of  taking6ral evidence. A full list of the witnesses is given in  Appendix IIto this Report.  In addition to the evidence taken orally we receiveda large number of written communications, including memoranda  on particular  aspects of our Inquiry furnished  to us by the Board ofTrade,  the  Ministry of Transport,  the Home Office,  the ForeignOffice, the Admiralty,  the Department of Overseas Trade and theBoard of Customs and Excise.    14.   We desire  to place on record  our indebtedness to  all whohave assisted us in our  Inquiry, whether by  giving oral evidence before us or by furnishing memoranda.                   (c.) Arrangement of  Report.    15.  Our terms of reference  are divided into two branches, the first dealing with proposals for the construction of a Channel Tunnel, and the second with other proposals for new means of cross-Channel communication.   In preparing our Report we  have thought it con- venient first to give a survey of the history of the proposals of both classes that have from time  to time been put forward in the past (Section II).  We  then  deal in detail with the various proposals that have been brought  to our notice  for improving cross-Channel communications otherwise than  by the construction of a Channel Tunnel  (Section III).
   16.  In Section IV  we outline  the  present proposals for  theconstruction of a Channel Tunnel.  Section V deals with the geo-logical and  engineering  problems involved.   In  Section  VI weconsider   the   traffic  problems  involved  in  these  proposals.Section VII is devoted to an examination of the economic aspects of aChannel Tunnel.  In Section VIII we refer briefly to certain  miscel-laneous considerations, some of which we feel do not fall within our terms of reference, but all of which will require at some stage to be carefully considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government.   17.  In Section IX we give a general survey of the evidence thatwe have received.   Our principal conclusions under both heads ofthe Inquiry are summarised in Section X.                 II. HISTORICAL  SURVEY.                      (a.) Early  History.   18.  Suggestions for the construction of a submarine tunnel be-tween England and Prance were made by Monsieur Mathieu as fat-back as the year 1800, but the first direct proposal  for carrying out such an undertaking was not put forward  until April 1867, whencertain English and French gentlemen submitted preliminary plans to the Emperor Napoleon III.   At the Emperor&apos;s suggestion,  anInternational Committee was appointed with a view to drawing up ascheme.  The outbreak of war between France  and Prussia in 1870put a  stop for a time to the progress  of  the work,  but,  on theconclusion of peace in 1871, various schemes were  set on foot witha view to improving Channel communications between England andFrance.  These plans included schemes for bridges, steam  ferries,tunnels and  powerful  steam  vessels,  with improved  harbouraccommodation.  While these various plans were being discussed,the promoters of the Channel Tunnel scheme pressed on with theiridea.   The English Committee obtained an Act  of  Incorporationunder the title of The Channel Tunnel Company, Limited.   great efforts were made to obtain  from Her  Majesty&apos;s  Government an expression of opinion on the  tunnel scheme; it was not, however,till June 1872 that the British Ambassador in Paris was authorisedto inform  the French Government that, subject to certain reserva-tions  as to its practical working, Her Majesty&apos;s Government saw no objection in principle to the scheme for a Channel Tunnel.  In1875, the British  Channel Tunnel Company obtained a  local act of Parliament (Channel Tunnel Company, Limited, Act, 1875) whichempowered them to acquire  land  near  Dover for the purpose ofcarrying out the objects for which they  were incorporated.  At thesame  period a  concession was granted by  the  French Governmentto the French promoters, which laid down certain  conditions onwhich the tunnel was to be constructed.  Simultaneously a law waspassed to carry out this concession  or &apos;&apos; convention &quot; as it was called.   19.  At  this stage a joint Commission was  appointed  by theBritish and French Governments  to consider the bases upon whicha Treaty should be concluded upon the subject between the twocountries.  The Commissioners met in  Paris  and London in theearly  part of 1876, and on the  31st May of that year submitted ajoint  report to which was attached  a memorandum  or  projet inwhich  was embodied the bases upon which  they recommended thata Treaty should be concluded between England and France.  Thatvrojet which  was  laid  before  Parliament contained   many important clauses.  Clause 1 defined the  boundary between Englandand France in  the Tunnel as  half-way between  low-water mark(above the Tunnel) on the coast  of England  and low-water mark(above the Tunnel) on  the coast  of  France.  By another clause(Clause 12)  it was  suggested that either Government might, afterthirty years,  purchase the undertaking; and by another (Clause 15)that each Government should have the  right  not  only to suspend the working of the Submarine Railway and  the passage through theTunnel whenever it should, in the interest  of its own country, think necessary to do so, but  also to destroy the works, by flooding orotherwise, without  granting  any  compensation for damage, otherthan  that which in its discretion it might think proper to pay tothe Company  established in its own country.    As  regards theoperation  and  inspection  of the  tunnel, the   projet  proposed
(Clause  4) that the two Governments  should  constitute  an Inter-national  Commission  of six members, of whom three should be nominated by each of the  two Governments.  This  commission should advise the two Governments  on  all questions relating tothe construction,  maintenance and working of the submarine rail-way, which it should have power to inspect.  The Commission shouldbe bound every year  to submit a report  to the respective Govern-ments, both  on its own proceedings  and on  questions  connectedwith  the submarine  railway.   It  was further proposed that theCommission should submit to the two Governments its proposals for supplementary  Conventions  with respect  to :  (a) the  apprehensionand trial of  alleged criminals for offences committed in the tunnelor in trains which had passed through it, and the summoning  of witnesses; (b) customs, police and postal arrangements  and othermatters which it might find convenient to deal with.                 (b.) Geological Investigations.   20. While the negotiations referred to in the preceding para-graphs were in progress, a number of  geological investigations were undertaken  with  a view to laying down a lino for  the proposedtunnel.   The first French engineer  to  study  the  question wasMonsieur Thome  de  Gamond, who,  in  1866,  proposed that thetunnel should be driven through the Wealden and Oolitic formationsof the  Jurassic  system between  Folkestone and Cape Grisnez,passing in its course  under  the Varne sandbank, which lies nearlymidway, in a direct line,  between the English and French coasts.His  proposal was to  sink a shaft on  the Varne itself and  a  shafton each side of the Channel,^ so that the work could be carried out from four  faces  instead of  only two,  and so shorten the time of construction.   In  England,  Sir  John  Hawkshaw was the firstengineer  seriously to study  the geological  question.   In  1865he employed Mr. Hartsink Day to make a  careful study of thecretaceous   and  underlying beds  on the English   and  Frenchcoasts.   The particular value  of this survey was that  it  showedconclusively that the chalk overlying the gault  is almost identicalon the  two coasts.  In order  to ascertain the nature of the stratacomposing the sea bed a special sounding apparatus  was designed.From an examination of the  specimens  brought up  by its meansfrom the sea bottom it was  claimed that  the  survey proved thecontinuity of the cretaceous beds  across  the  channel from side toside.  Sir  John  Hawkshaw was not,  however,  satisfied in havingonly established  the identity of the beds  as exposed on the cliffs on each side of the Channel and their superficial  continuity  on its bed.He  therefore decided that  it  was  necessary to ascertain by actualborings on  each  coast whether the thickness  of the  lower  beds of chalk which had been measured in the cliffs on each side  was in fact maintained after the lower beds had disappeared beneath the sea. He   accordingly  put down  two  borings.   One  was sunk  at St. Margaret&apos;s Bay, about 4 miles east of Dover, and 8 miles east of the outcrop of the lowest chalk bed on  the English coast, and the other on the French coast at Ferme Mouron, 2-   miles west of Calais and 4 miles east  of the outcrop of the same bed on the French coast. These borings showed that  the thickness of the lower  chalk does not diminish to any material  extent  as  it is followed eastwards from the outcrop.    21.  In 1875,  the newly-formed  French  Tunnel Company proceeded to make an extensive  and more  elaborate survey than that which  had  already been carried out by Sir John Hawkshavv. The Company took  some  7,000 soundings  in the  Channel and obtained a large  number of  specimens (3,760) from the bottom of the sea.  The  French geologists by whom this material was examined claimed that  they could  identify to which  particular strata  the specimens  belonged  and that from this  information they were able to plot with some accuracy the junction of the  lower chalk and the gault from shore to  shore  except for a  short distance where those beds pass beneath the sands  of the Varne near the middle of  the Channel.   The  Company also put down at this  time a boring at Sangatte, and a little later sank two shafts and drove headings in different directions through the lower beds of the chalk, a little to
othe west of Sangatte,  for the purpose of defining the position ofthose beds  and the gault.   22.  In August 1880,  an application was made by the  FrenchCompany for  an  extension of their concession, which had lapsed, as no  arrangement  had  been reached  with an  authorised  british company.   At  the  same  period,  the  South-Eastern  RailwayCompany   obtained  powers (South-Eastern  Railway  Act,  1881,Section 48) to acquire land for the purpose of experimental  boringsand other  work  in  connection with the construction  of a ChannelTunnel.  The Company also carried  out certain experimental workbetween Folkestone and Dover, where three shafts were sunk, onenear Abbots  Cliff, one near Shakespeare  Cliff,  and a third to( theeast of Shakespeare Cliff.  Headings  were driven from the first twoshafts in a  direction more or less parallel with the cliff,  through thelower beds  of grey chalk, and for some distance under the sea.                    (o.) Military  Objections.   28.  The  year 1880 marks an important stage in  the history ofthe scheme, as it was  in that year that British military objections were first raised.  In view of these  objections, it was decided, inApril 1883, to appoint  a Joint Select Committee of both Houses ofParliament &apos;&apos; to  inquire whether it is expedient that parliamentary sanction should  be  given to a Submarine Communication between england and France; and  to  consider  whether  any or  what conditions  should be imposed  by Parliament in  the  event  of such communication being  sanctioned.&quot;  The Committee were unableto reach sufficient  agreement even  to  submit a report  of  their investigations, and, finally, by a majority of six to four,  contentedthemselves with a bare expression of the opinion that it was notexpedient  that  Parliamentary sanction should be  given to theproposed scheme.  A draft report, setting out in detail the views ofLord Lansdowne, the Chairman of this  Committee,  who was infavour of the tunnel, summarises the case as it then stood.   24.  In view of the opinion expressed by the Select Committee,.the scheme was temporarily  dropped, but, within the next twelve years, it was brought forward again in  Parliament  no less thaneleven times, but on  each occasion  without success owing to theobjections  on military grounds  maintained  by successive Govern-ments.  It was not until after an interval of twelve  years that thematter  was again raised in Parliament  in 1906-07, with the same result.   Subsequent attempts in 1914 and  1919-20 to reopen thequestion were al&amp;o unsuccessful,  the Government of the day in eachcase resting its objections on military grounds.    The proposal was again brought forward in 1924 and was referred to the Committee ofImperial Defence.   On this occasion the  Committee had before them not only the views of the General Staffs  of the three services on thedefence questions raised by the  scheme but  also memoranda on its financial, commercial and transport  aspects. * The latter were pre-pared in the light of such information as was available by the Boardof Trade and the Ministry of Transport.  On  July  24th,  1924,  astatement  was made on behalf of the Government in the House ofCommons that the Committee of Imperial Defence concluded that theadvantages of a Channel  Tunnel were not commensurate with itsdisadvantages from the defence point of view and recommended thatthe  scheme  should  not  be allowed to proceed.  This  view was accepted by His  Majesty&apos;s Government.   Renewed efforts on behalfof the Tunnel were made in 1928, and these resulted in the appoint-ment in April 1929  of the  present Committee.Ill PROPOSED   NEW  METHODS   OP  CROSS-CHANNEL  COMMUNICATION OTHER THAN A CHANNEL TUNNEL.   25.  The various schemes put before us for  the improvementof cross-Channel communications otherwise than by the constructionof a railway tunnel under the Channel may be summarised under thefollowing heads :    (a.) The introduction of a cross-Channel passenger and goods         train ferry.   (b.) The construction of a Tunnel under the Channel that should         be  open to road traffic as well as to railway traffic.     [20352]                                     &apos;         0
    (c.)  The construction of a combined railway and  road cross-          Channel bridge.    (d.)  The construction of a railway tube to be laid across the bed          of the sea between England and France.    (e.)  The construction of a cross-Channel Jetty.    26.   We propose in the following paragraphs to give briefly our conclusions in  regard  to each of these schemes.                       (a.) Channel  Ferry.                    (i.) Advantages  Claimed.    27.   Those who advocate the introduction of a system of cross- Channel passenger train ferries make a two-fold  claim.  They urge that a ferry would offer many,  and those the most substantial, of the advantages claimed for a Channel Tunnel; and further,  that from  some points of view a  ferry  is  definitely  preferable to  a Tunnel.    28.   In the first place  it is claimed that as regards passenger traffic a ferry  would  be substantially as attractive  as a  Tunnel. Passengers would be able to enter their train at London and would be  under no necessity of leaving it until they arrived at Paris or whatever might be their Continental destination.   A large  part of  the delays consequent on embarking  and disembarking on  the cross-Channel boats would-be eliminated; and the  length of time occupied by the journey to London  could be  still further reduced by  arrangements being made for customs  and passport examinations to be carried out either on the ferry or  on  the  train.   In present conditions movement due to bad weather acts as a material deterrent to  cross-Channel passenger traffic.   The advocates  of  a passenger ferry admit  that  this disadvantage would  not be  so completely eliminated by  a Ferry  as  by  a  Tunnel, but  they  claim that  the relatively large size of ferry boats would greatly reduce the amount of discomfort experienced in present  conditions in bad  weather and would secure for  a ferry system as  large or almost  as large  an increase in passenger traffic as it is anticipated would follow the con- struction of a Tunnel.  As regards goods, a ferry would,  according to this view, be fully as good as a Tunnel, as it would offer the same advantages, viz.,  avoidance of transhipment,  more rapid delivery, and,- in the  case of perishable goods,  delivery in better condition than  at present.    29.   The second advantage claimed for a ferry is that its initial cost would be very small compared with that  of a Tunnel. In its early days the  service  would be largely experimental, but, if in fact, it secured the traffic anticipated for it, there would be no difficulty in increasing the  number of ferry boats on the service.  On the other hand, the amount of traffic that  a Tunnel would carry is definitely limited  and the  whole of the  contemplated expenditure has to be  incurred before it  can be opened  to traffic.  Further, if circum- stances  were favourable, ferry sendees could be instituted between a number of British and Continental ports, there being no necessity as  in the case of  a  Tunnel to concentrate the whole traffic on a single route.   Finally,  the advocates of a  ferry point to the  un- certainty whether it is actually possible to construct a Tunnel  and to  the  large sums of  capital which  would be wasted  if, at a  late -stage of the  work, difficulties  arose which  made  it  necessary  to abandon it.                (ii.) Disadvantages of Train Ferries.    30.  It appears from the evidence laid before us that Dover is the only English port at all suitable for such a  service, as Folkestone could only be made available at a heavy expense.  On the French coast, Calais, which was used during the  war, would probably be the most suitable port, though Boulogne could also be used.    31.  If a train ferry service were established, it would clearly be -desirable  to employ  boats of  considerable dimensions in order to Teduee  movement due  to  bad weather to a minimum.   Sufficient -depth of water is, we are informed, available at Dover for a  boat
with  a  draught  of  16-18  feet,  i.e.,  with a  length  of from750-850 feet, equipped with four railway tracks,  each capable of taking one complete  train.    It  appears,  however,  that at  theContinental ports, the depth of water available is only sufficient totake boats with  a draught of 13-14  feet,  and that  it could only beincreased at  very heavy cost.  A ferry boat of this shallow draughtwould be unmanageable in these ports if built of the length suggested above.   It would, however,  be  possible  to construct an  efficient.ferry boat with a  length of about 400-500 feet with four tracks onthe  deck, platforms  between the  tracks  and  cabins   for  the-passengers.  But a boat of this size  would be open to the  objection that full length trains using the ferry would have to&quot; be split in halfwith a consequent delay in loading  and unloading.  In addition, a relatively small  boat of this  type would  be  much  less satisfactoryfor use on a passenger service in rough weather.    82.   At the  ports under consideration, the difference  betweenhigh and low water is  considerable.  According to Admiralty  tidetables, that between mean high water spring tide and mean  lowwater spring tide is 18 feet at Dover and 21 feet at Calais.   various methods have been adopted  and suggested for transferring  trainsto and from ferry boats.   One method is to have a platform with,say, two railway tracks  on it,  which can be  raised  or loweredto the level  of  the ferry boat deck,  trains being run on to  thisplatform, which is then raised or lowered  to the level of the railwaytracks on the shore.  This method,  we are advised, is feasible  andsafe, but the cost of construction is high.  Another method would beto have  an enclosed dock in  which the water level would  be soadjusted that the railway tracks on board and ashore coincide.  this method  can only be  adopted  in  favourable  conditions,  which,according  to our information,  do not  exist in the harbours  underconsideration.   A third and  commonest method  is to have a steeltransfer bridge,  hinged at the edge of the  wharf, and supported nearits outer  end by a pontoon in  such  a  way that it can be  raised orlowered by the tide to suit the level of the boat.  The constructionof a transfer bridge of this type would not, we are advised, presentany great engineering difficulties, but.  in  order that the gradient on it should at no  point exceed 1 in 20,  it would have to be  made of greater length than is usual,  and would occupy a  long stretch of theport or quay.    38.   There seems little doubt that a ferry such as that  described above would be feasible.   Dover harbour is not, however, well adapted for train  ferry work, and unless  the ferry boat berthing dock were placed in the submarine basin, it is probable that, with the wind incertain quarters,  the  movement would  be  sufficient  to preventloading  and  unloading.   To  ensure  a  regular  and  dependableservice,  it would, therefore, be  necessary to undertake additionalprotection work  inside the harbour,  which would considerably raisethe cost of this terminus.  The  berthing dock  could,  however, beplaced in the submarine basin at a  less cost,  if  the necessaryrailway connections were  made.    84.   The following is the  closest  estimate that  we have beenable to obtain of the probable  cost of a passenger and goods ferry.It should, however, be definitely regarded as approximate only :                                                              Cost of Terminus at Dover, say  ...       672,000         Cost of Terminus at Calais, say  ...       805,000         4 boats at (say)  250,000       ...     1,000,000                            1,977,000Add  10 per  cent.      ...       197,000                                              2,174,000   85.  If it were considered desirable to use Boulogne as well as-Calais, an additional outlay of approximately  410,000 would, weare advised,  be necessary.  A  saving  of approximately  200,000on the above figures might be secured if it was found  possible touse the submarine basin at  Dover.  The evidence laid before  ussuggests that the cost of a ferry would probably be reduced by halfit it  were confined to goods  and motor vehicles.   A ferry service
confined to goods would not,  however,  constitute  an alternative to a Channel Tunnel, as the chief merit claimed for a Tunnel lies in the anticipated increase of cross-Channel passenger traffic.                        (hi.)  Conclusion.   86.  Even if  the additional works  referred to  in  the preceding paragraphs were carried out, the cost of instituting a cross-Channelpassenger ferry service would be much less than that of building aChannel Tunnel.   We are, however, satisfied that  the Dover-Calais:and Folkestone-Boulogne routes are unsuitable for  a passenger ferryservice.   We base this view mainly  on  the following considera-tions :     (a.) For these routes it would  be necessary  to employ  boats of          shallow draught and therefore  of relatively small size.          From the point of view of passengers  who object to a sea          passage in rough weather, such a ferry would offer few, if          any, advantages over the existing Channel boats.    (b.) The relatively small size of the  ferry boats would make it          necessary to split the trains.  There  would therefore be          little or no saving of time in  the  cross-Channel  journey          by train ferry as compared  with the  existing services.   37.  Further,  it should be observed that the war-time ChannelFerry services,  to which  reference has been  made,  were  goodsservices.  The operation of a goods ferry in the circumstances thenobtaining was comparatively simple.  There was no necessity for time-tables to be strictly  adhered  to,  and it was thus possible totake  advantage of favourable weather and  tides.  Such  methodsof  working  would,  however,  be  out  of   the  question  for  acommercial passenger  and goods  service in time of peace.   In thecircumstances we  are satisfied that though a passenger train ferryservice could  be instituted,  it  would  offer  few  attractions ascompared  with  the existing  boat service.   We have reason  tobelieve that this is  also  the  view  of   the Railway  companies concerned, who,  in existing conditions,  are free  to  institute sucha  service,  and would no doubt have done so if they had  thoughtit  commercially attractive.            (b.)  Combined Railway and Road  Tunnel.    38.  No actual proposals have been submitted  to  us for a com-hined rail  and road tunnel, but, in reply to an inquiry  regarding their  views  on   the  economic  aspects  of the  proposals  for  a tunnel,  one  of   the  Trade  Associations  expressed the  opinion&quot;that  if  it  should  be  decided  by  His  Majesty&apos;s  Governmentto proceed with the construction  of such a Channel Tunnel, theTunnel should embrace  a scheme  for the transport of goods and passengers by road.&quot;  At  first sight such  a proposal  is not withoutits attractions, but, apart from the very heavy increase which its adoption would entail in the  cost of the  scheme, we are satisfiedon investigation  that  for  other reasons it is impracticable.   Anytunnel constructed under the  Channel would of necessity be about36 miles long and would be constructed in the form of an invertedsyphon, the  lowest part of which  would be some 800 to 400 feetlower than  either  end.   The  carbon  monoxide  gas  given off by motor ears from their exhausts is fatal to human  life.  If motortraffic  was permitted in  the tunnel, the  gas  given off,  beingheavier than air, would  accumulate  in  the  lower levels  of thetunnel.  We are  advised that it is  extremely doubtful whether any form of blower or suction fan could be constructed of sufficient powerto drive such gas from  a tunnel  36 miles long.   Unless arrange-ments to this end could be made, it  would  be impossible  for cars&quot;to be driven  through the tunnel.   We  understand that, even  in the^short-length tunnels  under the  Thames, difficulty  is experiencedwith  the  gas from  motor car  exhausts,  and  that  drivers notinfrequently suffer from gas  poisoning  when blocks occur in the traffic in these tunnels.  This is particularly significant if regard isTiad to the fact that, compared with a  Channel Tunnel, the ThamesTunnels have  very little depth and  are of considerably greaterdiameter than any  tunnel proposed  to be  constructed under theChannel.
                      (o.) Channel Bridge.   89.  At  ft late stage of our inquiry we  received from  Sir  M.MacDonald  &amp;  Partners and  Monsieur A.  Huguenin,  managing director of  the Societe Technique d&apos;Etudes et d&apos;Entreprises pourrindustrie,  particulars  (including plans and sections) of  a  schemefor a Channel Bridge.   The design submitted contemplates the con-struction of  a bridge between  Folkestone and Cape  Grisnez, a distance of 22 miles.  For the greater part of its length the bridgewould carry two railway tracks,  but  on a length of  3  miles situatedabout midway across the Channel it is proposed to construct a  PassingStation  of four lines of tracks.  This would  allow for a large-increaseof traffic over that which  could be carried  by a continuous two-linetrack.  Above the railway&apos; tracks it is proposed that there should be aroadway 33  feet wide which would be sufficient to carry four lines oftraffic.   To  meet the  requirements of navigation, the  bridge  asdesigned provides a clearance  of 200 feet above high water level fora length of 10,000 feet (i.e., five spans of 2,000 feet) on each side ofthe two routes 4 or 5 miles away from the French and English coastsrespectively, which the designers state  are principally used for navi-gation up and down the Channel.  Ample and powerful lighting forthe piers in each fairway   would also be provided.  The authors ofthis scheme claim that  a bridge  of this design would  not  cause anyserious  obstruction  to navigation, the spans of 2,000  feet beinggreater than those of the Forth Bridge and the clearance being larger than that provided in any existing bridge.  It appears from the plans of the design submitted that  it is proposed that the spans of  thebridge should be of  the continuous suspension  type  with invertedthree hinged trusses and cable  wind trusses.  There would be twenty-six spans on the British side and twenty-seven on the French side,each 2,000  feet in length, and  a four track bridge of twenty-ninespans of 450 feet each in the centre of  the Channel.  The authors ofthis scheme estimate its total cost at . 75.000,000.  They anticipate that the receipts of the  Bridge in its first year of operation would beas follows :                  Per Annum.                  Rate.              2,500,000 Railway  passengers        ...   1      2,500.000      1,000,000  Road  passengers in  private        cars and buses............ 1      1,000.000     10,000,000 tons  rail freight     ......   10/-     5,000.000      1,000.000 tons  lorry freight   ......   10/-       500,0009,000,000This income  would,  in their view,  cover the cost of  operation andupkeep, and  in  addition would provide an  adequate  return on thecapital expended.  They propose that the Bridge should be owned by a British  public company, which should also have full power ofcontrol over the road traffic,  the rail traffic  being under the controlof the Southern  Railway.  They further propose that the connectingrailway from Cape Grisnez  station  and the connecting road at theFrench end  of  the Bridge should  be  constructed by  Frenchcompanies.   40.  It is clear from the data placed at our  disposal that a greatdeal of thought has been given to the engineering  problems thatwould  be involved in the construction of the proposed bridge. Weare not in a position to question the  feasibility of such a project fromthe engineering point of view, vouched for as it is by  so eminentauthorities as Sir Murdoch Macdonald and  Monsieur  Huguenin.We think it  right to point out, however,  that  the design and-con-struction of  such a  bridge  would involve  many  problems for thesolution of which there is  no exact  precedent, and  that it  wouldrequire a  considerable  amount of  preliminary  investigation andexamination  before   the  nature  of  the  difficulties  likely   to  be encountered  could be properly estimated.   Further,  the problems connected  with  maintenance, involving the remedying and fore-stalling of damage to which the structure both  above and  belowwater would be liable, present difficulties which in the light of presentknowledge  would seem to render any estimate of cost of maintenance and upkeep extremely unreliable.   We have not, however, thought
it necessary to pursue a technical examination of the scheme as weare convinced that on other grounds it cannot to-day be considered a practicable solution of the  problem of  cross-Channel communica-tion.  As regards the financial aspect of the proposal, the estimatedcost of the scheme is, in our  view, prohibitive.   Further, we do notthink that at the relatively high rates proposed the bridge would belikely to secure  the  volume  of either rail or road traffic indicated above.  The gravest objection to the scheme is, however, the obstruc-tion which such a bridge would cause to navigation and the difficulty,amounting in our view to an impossibility, of securing agreement forits  construction.  As regards the lighting of the bridge, we under-stand that there are at present no satisfactory  or  reliable  lightscapable of  penetrating fog for any  considerable distance and thatpowerful foghorns  are  not  always reliable owing to atmosphericconditions and silent zones.   We  are advised that, even if it were possible adequately  to light  the piers, navigation in the Channelduring foggy weather would  be exceptionally difficult and that evena slight miscalculation would entail  disaster, especially for vesselstravelling with the tide.    Sailing ship traffic, in addition,  wouldbecome practically impossible, in other than very fine weather, except at considerable towage cost to the  owners.   In narrow waters suchas the Channel having peculiar tidal effects subjected to a fair amountof mist and  fog, the  difficulties of navigation are always the  cause ofsome anxiety.   These difficulties  would  be very greatly increasedby the addition of twenty-six obstructions in the form of piers fromthe bridge  in the British half of the Channel  and twenty-sevensimilar obstructions on the  French half.    In so far  as the pierswould be sunk within the 8-mile limit, it might be possible to obtainthe necessary approval of  His MajestyV Government  and of theFrench Government respectively.  For the remainder of the distancethe piers would, however, have to be sunk in  the bed of the high seas.   These piers would undoubtedly cause a serious obstruction to navigation,  and we find it difficult to believe that the necessary inter-national agreement for their erection could  be secured.                (d.) Rail Tube on Bed of Channel.    41.  Another scheme, submitted to us from  an Italian source, contemplates the construction of  a submerged railway tube  on the bed of the  Channel.  From the patent specifications placed before us, it appears that  the proposed submerged tunnel would  comprise a  number  of   tubular  elements  resiliently   connected   to  one another in  regular  succession and adapted to be sunk and secured in the desired  position  on  the  bottom  of  the sea.    These would  be  joined to one auother  above water in relatively short lengths and would  consist of an inner cylindrical sheet  metal tube of such  thickness  of wall  as would  enable  it to withstand  the pressure of the water above.  The metal tube would be surrounded by a hard compact  jacket  of concrete or similar material and would be enclosed on the  outside by another cylindrical sheet metal tube for the protection and reinforcement of the concrete jacket.  Each tubular  element  would  be  provided  with   reinforcing   radially arranged longitudinal  I-irons  embedded in the  mass of  concrete and  firmly bolted and secured both to  the inner and outer sheet metal cylinders, so that the two cylinders and the jacket of concrete would be united in a single block.  In the form placed before us the  scheme contemplated  the  construction on the foregoing  lines of a railway  tube  having  a diameter of  10  feet.  The  inventor claimed that if constructed in the  manner  described above, it would be rigid,  watertight and immobile while on  the  sea  bottom, but would be sufficiently flexible to be  capable of being raised at any point to the surface of the sea for repairs when necessary.   Another feature of  the  scheme would be  the  construction of  two towers rising above the surface of the sea which  would provide  light and ventilation and would also act as  passing stations for the single line tubes.  According to the inventor&apos;s  calculations, it  would be possible to construct  such a tube at  a  cost  of  not  more than  2.000,000.  This scheme has  been considered by our  technical advisers, who report that whatever may be the merits or possibilities of tubes on the sea bottom  as compared with tunnels, the particular  scheme outlined above cannot  be regarded  as practicable.     In
addition, the proposed towers would form a serious obstruction to navigation, and, as they would be situated on the bed of the high seas, similar difficulties would be experienced in regard to obtaininginternational  approval for their  construction to  those  to  which reference has been made (paragraph 40) in regard to the suggestedChannel Bridge.   An  outline of  a somewhat similar scheme was submitted to us from an Australian source.  This plan contemplated the construction of a tube which, instead of resting on the bed ofthe sea, would be raised by  stays anchored to  the sea bed.   Thisscheme, in our opinion,  is open to the same objections and is asimpracticable as that discussed in the earlier portion of.this Section.                    (e.) Gross-Channel Jetty.   42.  Finally, we have received from a Swiss engineer a project for the construction of a double jetty across the Channel.   Underthis  scheme two parallel dams would be constructed from Deal toCalais,  each carrying two railway tracks and a motor road.   Thewater  enclosed between  the  two  dams would form a large  canalfor ships and  barges.  By the construction of an  additional  canal15 miles in length  from Deal to Herne Bay,  London  would be directly connected  with  the  whole  canal  system of France andGermany  and  with the Rhine and  the  Danube.   It  is furtherproposed that the two dams should be  connected with  the  coasthy bridges sufficiently high to afford free passage to steamers.   Theestimated cost of the scheme is  80,000,000.  We have not thoughtit  necessary to consider  the  technical  aspects of this proposal as,apart from its  cost, the  obstruction to navigation which it  would cause in the Channel would be even more serious than that in thecase  of  the Channel Bridge (paragraph 40&quot;), and would be sufficientto render  the  scheme wholly impracticable.IY. THE PRESENT PROPOSALS FOR A CHANNEL TUNNEL.               (a.) Tunnel  System Recommended.   48.   Our terms of reference do not  direct  us  to  consider anyparticular proposal for a Channel Tunnel  but  to  advise generally on the economic questions raised by any proposal for such a Tunnel.We have therefore felt that it was our  duty to consider  on their merits any scheme that might be submitted to us.   44.   In fact, only two  Tunnel schemes have been  laid beforeus, the  first by the Channel Tunnel Company, the second by theLondon  and Paris Railway Promoters,  Ltd.   The  proposals  ofthe latter  Company include the  acquisition of the rights of theEnglish  and French Channel Tunnel Companies,  the constructionof a Channel  Tunnel and  the provision of a new railway from london to the  English coast and from the  French coast to Paris.They  propose that a  7-foot  gauge should be adopted for this line and they claim that  under  their scheme it would be  possible  to run a  train from London  to Paris in 2f hours.   The Companyestimate the  cost of the   English  section  of  the  railway   at 58,500,000,   that  of   the  French  section   at  approximately 100,000,000,  and that of the  Tunnel at  30,800,000.   Thisscheme seems  to  us  prohibitive in cost  and impracticable in thepresent state of engineering knowledge and experience, quite  apartfrom the strong opposition which  existing interests would certainlyraise as  soon as any attempt was  made to obtain the necessarystatutory powers from Parliament.   45.   The proposals of the Channel Tunnel  Company are on a-different footing.  As has been shown in  the  historical summary(paragraph  18),  Parliament has  conferred   certain  powers   inconnection with the proposals for a Channel Tunnel on this company and on  the Southern Railway (as the  successors of the South-Eastern Railway Company).   The two Companies have always been closely associated,  and the Chief Engineer of the Southern Railwayis also Chief Engineer to the Channel Tunnel  Company.   In oursubsequent examination of the proposal for  a Channel Tunnel, wehave therefore confined ourselves to the consideration of the scheme
If)put forward by the Channel Tunnel Company or to possible modifi-nations of it.  The Company&apos;s proposal contemplates the constructionof a Channel Tunnel of a total length of 36 miles, of which 24 mileswould be actually under the Straits of Dover.   The remaining 12miles would be approach tunnels on  either coast.  The company would itself undertake the construction of the approach Tunnel at theEnglish  end and  of  the English half  of the Tunnel  under thesea.   The  other half of the  Tunnel under the sea and the Frenchapproaches would be built by the Association franqaise four  Vitudeet la realisation  du Chemin de  Fer sous-marin entre la Franceet V Angleterre.   46.   The Company propose that  the tunnelling to be  under-taken should consist  of  (a)  two independent traffic Tunnels,  each with a  diameter  of 18 feet 6  inches, and (b) of  a  smaller  pilottunnel,  having a diameter of 10 feet, for drainage and ventilationpurposes.  The Company consider that the only practical  route forthe tunnel would be in the bed of the  grey chalk,  and that the geological  data  available (paragraphs 20  to  22)  are  sufficient tojustify&apos; an  immediate start being made on  the pilot tunnel withoutfurther  extensive geological investigations.  The Chemin de  Fer duNord are also optimistic regarding  the continuity of the geologicalformation, but consider that expenditure  amounting to, say eight orten million paper  francs would be desirable on further  exploratorywork before the boring of the pilot tunnel is  begun.    These pre-liminary investigations would include the  sinking of new borings, thetesting of the latest excavating methods, and also an examination ofthe various means of evacuating the spoil,  e.g., by the  Fougerollesmethod  (paragraph 60)  or otherwise.   The Nord Eailway  statethat they are prepared to undertake this expenditure provided that they are assured  in  advance  that  objections  on  military or other grounds  will  not  be raised  at a later stage  by  His  Majesty&apos;s Government.  Both the British and French Companies propose that the  pilot tunnel should be driven through the whole length of the under-sea section before any  work was undertaken on  the  main traffic  tunnels.   The  whole  of the Tunnel  section  linking the Southern  Railway and the Chemin de Fer du Nord would be elec- trically  operated, and for this purpose it would be  necessary to construct  exchange  stations  at each end of the Tunnel.   It  is anticipated that the open approaches from the mouth of the Tunnel to the exchange  station on  the English side (which would be at Sandling  Junction) would be  3 miles and 20 chains in length and that the length of those on the French  side would be  5  miles and 30 chains.  The  Channel Tunnel  Company would not themselves own any rolling-stock.  Under the scheme the cost of the exchange stations  and  of  any consequential  improvements  that  might be required in the  existing railway lines to  the English  and French coasts   would  be   met by  the   Southern Railway  and  the Ohemin de Fer du Nord respectively. The latter Companies would also share the cost  of  the new steel rolling-stock required.  The Channel  Tunnel  Companies  would not  themselves  maintain or operate the Tunnel  section, but would  enter into  agreements for these services to  be  carried out by the  Railway  Companies named above, which would be in a position to do so at a substantially lower cost.     47..  The Company estimate that it would be possible to complete  the pilot tunnel in a period of about 2-1- years  and the traffic tunnels  in about    years.  The whole operation could,  in  their view, be  carried through in a period of 6-1 to 7 years.  They estimate the cost  of the pilot tunnel at  5,000,000, and that of  the  traffic tunnels  (including approach  tunnels)  at   25,000,000.   Of  the  total  expenditure of  80,000,000,  one-half would  fall  to be met by the  English Company.   As regards the finance of the  scheme,  the  Company have informed us that,  in the first instance, they would  propose  to confine  themselves  to  an  issue of  ordinary shares  sufficient in amount to cover the cost of the  English section of the  pilot  tunnel.  Under this  scheme the actual work of construction  would be carried out simultaneously by two Companies, the British  Company building the  British half, and the French  Company the  French half.  The Company  realise that the closest co-ordination  would be necessary between the work  of the two Companies, and  suggest that this might be secured by the  formation of  a single  holding Company.  The Company do &quot;not anticipate any difficulty
as  regards  the maintenance  and  subsequent  operation  of theTunnel.  They point out also that by means of the Tunnel it wouldbe possible to maintain continuous services without fear of interruption-tion as  at present owing  to rough weather.  It is true that if a tunnel  was constructed,  a larger  proportion of  the  total traffic would  be concentrated on  a single route than  at present.   Atemporary breakdown in one of the  traffic  tunnels might thereforelead to considerable congestion, but it should always be  possibleto maintain a modified service by running trains in either directionin the remaining traffic tunnel.                  (b.) The Gauges Proposed.    48.  The foregoing estimates by the Channel Tunnel Companyassume that so far as the  track gauge is concerned British rolling-stock could run on Continental lines and Continental rolling-stockon British  lines.    The  difference  between  the  British  and continental  standard track  gauges  does not amount to more  than three-sixteenths of  an inch,  and  from  the  evidence we  havereceived it is clear  that  no  difficulty on this  account would  be experienced  in the interchange of British and Continental rolling stock.   This view is  confirmed by the experience gained during thewar, and also more recently by that of the London and North-EasternRailway Company, who, for a number of  years past, have  success-fully operated  a train ferry between Harwich  and Zeebrugge.    49.  There are,  however,  important  differences  between the structural loading gauge  in this  country and that in use on theContinent, where, under  the Berne Agreement arrived at in theearly part of this century, vehicles  can be employed about 25 percent, greater  in their  cross-section area than  is possible in thiscountry.   Before  vehicles  conforming  to  the  Berne  standardcould   be   employed   in   England,  heavy  expenditure  wouldhave  to  be  incurred  in  widening  tunnels,   re-spacing  tracks,strengthening bridges, and  otherwise adapting  the existing system to their use.  It has been  estimated that before Continental coachescould be brought from the coast to London, expenditure of  upwards of   10,000,000 would require to  be incurred by the southern railway, an expenditure  which might prejudice the success of thescheme from  the financial point of view.   Up to the time of thepresent inquiry it has been generally assumed that  such altera-tions would be necessary,  and that the  Southern Railway  wouldhave to look to its share  of the profits arising from the tunnel to recoup itself for this outlay.   Since our appointment, conversationshave, however, taken place  between the Southern Railway and theChemin de Per du Nord, as  a result of  which  the witnesses whoappeared  before  us  on behalf of  those  Companies were able tostate that rolling-stock constructed  to suit the  English  loading-gauge  would be  accepted in France if  a tunnel was  built.   Weunderstand that this arrangement  would be applicable to the wholeof the French railways, and that probably arrangements could alsobe made to permit such vehicles operating on the Swiss and Italiansystems.  Under such an arrangement, foreign railway companies would construct a given number of vehicles to the English loadinggauge  for use on the tunnel service.  Such  rolling-stock  wouldnot, to any  great  extent,  be  smaller than the ordinary modernContinental  coaches,  as  their  height   would  be only  slightlyreduced, and  their width need not  be more than five  inches lessthan that of the most modern coach run in France.   As regardsexisting English coaches, we are  advised that  the majority couldbe made  without  great expense  to run on the Continental  lines should  this, at any  time, be  advisable.    50.   This  development very materially reduces the cost of thetunnel scheme, as it relieves the Southern Railway of the necessityof recasting their system from the coast to London.  The southern railway inform  us that  in  the  altered  circumstances the  onlyexpenditure that they anticipate having to incur in connection withthe construction of the  Tunnel,  apart  from any outlay due toincrease in traffic,  would be  (a)  the provision of the exchangestation  at  Sandling Junction and  of about 8  miles of  railway,(b) the connecting  up of the electrical  supply  to the  &quot;Grid,&quot;
which they  assume would  be provided by the Central  electricity board  by   1988,  (c)  the  provision  of the  necessary  electriclocomotives, (d) the provision of additional rolling-stock for throughrunning  to  the Continent,  and (e)  the provision  of  additionalstabling and cleaning sheds in London for the carriages engaged inthis through running.  The cost under heading (a), which includes the  necessary  bonded goods warehouses,  the  locomotive  andcarriage sidings and sheds, marshalling sidings, customs aecommo-dation, land, &amp;c, is estimated by the company at  2,000,000.  Asregards  items (6) to (e), the company state that they are  not in aposition to form reliable estimates of cost  until the detailed schemesof the  services  and through  working  have been tabulated.   Theyestimate, however, that they would require at least  3,000,000 ofnew capital to carry out the consequential  works ((a) to (e)) referredto above.   51.  As  regards waggon  stock,  the  position  is  substantially the same as that  for passenger  rolling-stock,  most Continentalwaggons being  unable  to  run  on  British  railways.    Thereare,  however,  a certain  number of  waggons on the  Continentwhich,  with a  few  small alterations,  could be  made availablefor the  tunnel  service.    We  understand  from  the  evidence submitted to  us by  the  Chemin de  Fer  du  Nord  that theycontemplate that special waggons should be built by the Britishand Continental railways for the tunnel service, and that wherever,say in France,  sufficient  goods traffic to England  was attractedto the tunnel route, such  waggons would be employed.  In  that case  there  would be no  need for transhipment at French ports.In the case of  less localised goods traffic, or traffic coming fromgreater distances, transhipment from ordinary Continental waggonsto tunnel service waggons would be necessary.   Y GEOLOGICAL  AND ENGINEERING  PROBLEMS.            (a.) The Feasibility of a Channel Tunnel.   52.   In the historical survey (paragraphs  20-22) we have given a brief  outline  of the geological investigations which  have been undertaken  with a  view  to  ascertaining  the  practicability of driving a tunnel under the Channel.   On this subject we receiveda detailed  memorandum  from  Sir John  Flett,  Director of  the geological Survey, which was supplemented by oral evidence fromMr. John Pringle,  an officer of that Department, who has made aspecial study of this subject, who appeared before us on  his behalf.Evidence  regarding the  investigations   undertaken by  Frenchgeologists  was  submitted  to us  by  Monsieur  Javary,  managing director of  the  French Channel Tunnel Committee  and general manager  of the   Chemin  de  Fer  du  Nord.    In  addition,Baron d&apos;Erlanger, the Chairman of the British  Channel TunnelCompany, was good enough to obtain permission, for which we  are most grateful, from the French Ministry of  Public Works for  the communication to us of the Beport, dated July 1919, prepared by a french  Government   Channel   Tunnel  Committee   under   theChairmanship of Monsieur C. Colson.   58.  The data available fall  into  three classes,  namely,  thatafforded by  the  beds of chalk showing on the cliffs on each sideof the Channel, by the  corresponding  beds disclosed  by shaftsand  headings  which  have  been  driven on   the  English  andFrench   coasts,  and  by  the  soundings  in  the   channel and  surface samples  obtained  from  its  bed  by  the  Frenchgeologists  in  1875  (paragraph  21).    As  regards  the  general line of the  tunnel,  the evidence of the  geologists is  substantiallyunanimous.   All are agreed that if a tunnel is  to be constructed,it must be driven  on  a  line  below  the  water-bearing strataof the  upper and  middle  chalk.  Equally,  they  are agreed  thatit must be on  some  line  above the gault, which  overlies  thelower greensand which has as much,  if  not  more, water than  theupper chalk. It follows, therefore, that,  in their opinion,  the onlyformation in which the construction of  a  tunnel could be attemptedwith any hope of success is the lower chalk.  With their report theConsulting   Engineers   submitted a   plan and  section  (seeAppendix IV)  showing the suggested  centre line  for  the  ChannelTunnel and  the strata which they anticipated would be encountered
on that line.  From the geological point of view, the success of theundertaking depends on the continuity under the Channel of thelower chalk.  The evidence referred to above points generally to theconclusion that  it does extend uninterruptedly across the  Straits.There is, however,  an undoubted risk that fissures or even infilledvalleys may be encountered.   54.   The whole of the evidence which we have received on thispart of the subject has been placed at the disposal of the consulting engineers,  who  have  themselves  also  undertaken  independentinquiries.  In their report (Section (1)  (a) (i) and (ii)) they discussthe  possibility of employing cementation in  the event of waterbeing  encountered  in large quantities, and express the view thatif fissures, filled with rough gravel and, therefore, affording fairlyfree passage for  the sea water,  were met with, cementation wouldprobably seal them up, but that if close sand were met with, whichyielded large  quantities of water, the conditions would be moredifficult, and  the  success  of  the  process  doubtful.   They add,however, that,  with the development of  engineering  resources,fissures,  unless of exceptional size, would not present any insuperable-able difficulty. As regards the possibility of meeting an infilled valleycharged  with water at a pressure of, say, 150 lbs. per square inch,they consider that the position would be  very  serious, but evenin that event they hesitate to say that the project would  have  tobe abandoned, as it might be possible to deal with it by adopting a shield  with an entirely closed  face, the excavation being removed by  powerful water jets  and washed  through controlled pipes  inthe  bulkhead.                (b.) Preliminary Exploratory Work.    55.  The witnesses who have appeared before us have expresseddivergent views  regarding the  need for,  or desirability  of, furthergeological  investigations  before work on  the  pilot tunnel  was actually begun.    56.  Some,  like the Channel Tunnel Company, feel  that theinformation already obtained is substantially as full as can be looked for and  that the only geological investigation that would throw reallight on the feasibility of a Channel Tunnel would be the successfulconstruction of the proposed pilot heading.  Others take a contraryview and  urge  the  need  for  further  soundings or  even  boringsthrough the bed of  the sea.  Most witnesses expressed the viewthat it was desirable that  surface samples should be obtained  atleast from the sector about half-way across the Straits from which no  samples were obtained in the previous surveys. The consulting engineers concur in this view and recommend that samples andsoundings should be obtained from this and other areas from whichsufficient data are not at present available.  As regards the latter,we   understand  that  the proposal  is  that  a  sufficient  number  ofsamples  and soundings should be obtained  to afford a rough checkof the accuracy of  the  former surveys.  It is  stated  that thenecessary  observations if carried  out  by  one  of His  Majesty&apos;sSurveying Ships could be made in the  space of one or two  months,provided that the  weather  was  good.   The Consulting Engineersdo  not favour borings on the bed of the Channel. They point outthat they could not, except at enormous  expense, be made  at frequent intervals,  and that even then there would be no certainty that fissures or  infilled  valleys  did not  exist between  them.   Ingeneral, they  hold that  a  definite  opinion  on  the  feasibility  of constructing  a   Channel  Tunnel cannot  be  expressed  until theground has been proved by the construction of a pilot tunnel.                 (c.) Pilot  and Drainage Tunnels.    57.  The scheme put forward by the Channel Tunnel Company(paragraph 46)  contemplates the driving of a pilot tunnel  with  an internal diameter of 10 feet for the whole width of the Straits before any expenditure is incurred in connection with  the main traffictunnels.  The intention is that this tunnel should be so sited that itwould rise towards  the centre of the Channel,  and thus, being below the main  tunnels, would be available for  drainage  purposes.   Insuch  a  drainage tunnel,  any  water  encountered would  flow  bygravitation to the pumps at the shore ends.
                58.  All the witnesses that have appeared before us agree on the             necessity of a pilot tunnel.  They  differ, however,  in their  con-             ception of the functions and siting of such a tunnel.   Some favour             the plan of the  Channel Tunnel Company and consider that the             pilot tunnel should be so constructed  that it should be available             afterwards  for drainage purposes.  Other witnesses point out  that             a pilot tunnel of this  kind  would be open to  the objection  that,             owing to the north-easterly  dip in the geological formation of the             Channel, it would emerge  at the English coast some three miles             or more to the east of the  proposed  alignment of the  main traffic             tunnels.   A pilot  tunnel so constructed could  therefore  give no             indication of the continuity of the lower chalk along a considerable             section of the route proposed for the traffic tunnels.  The witnesses             who hold this view recommend that  to get over this  difficulty the             pilot tunnel should be driven on substantially the same line and  at             the same general level as  the  proposed traffic tunnels, and  that,             in order to check  the  formation through which the  latter would             actually pass, radial boreholes should be driven at regular distances.             Some  witnesses who  adopt  this view consider,  however, that  con-             currently with the  construction  of a pilot tunnel on the line of the             proposed traffic  tunnel, there  should  be  driven also a drainage             tunnel.   In their opinion the latter will in any  ease be required  as             part of any Channel Tunnel scheme, and the  construction of the             pilot  tunnel would be  easier   and  the risks run by the labour             engaged less if  the drainage tunnel was constructed concurrently.                59.  These  views  have been   carefully  examined  by  the             Consulting Engineers,  who  recommend a slight variation from any             of the plans that  have been laid before us.   They consider  that             there  should be  a  drainage  tunnel having an internal diameter  of             7 feet, and that it should  slope from the centre of the Channel             down  to &quot;the coast  on each side to permit of drainage by  gravita-             tion.   They  agree also that  a pilot  tunnel  should be driven             substantially along the line of  the proposed traffic tunnels.  They             recommend that, as the pilot tunnel proceeds,  advance and radial             boreholes should be  driven from it  to explore the  ground ahead             and all round it in order to obtain the fullest  information regarding             the ground through  which  the main tunnels  would  subsequently             be driven.  The drainage  tunnel  and the pilot tunnel could,  in             their  view, be  driven  simultaneously, but  the former should  be             kept in advance.  As  regards  the  internal diameter  of the  pilot             tunnel,  they consider it should  be about 12 feet (instead of 10 feet             as proposed by  the  Channel  Tunnel  Company), and that,  if it             is successfully completed, it should become  a permanent  unit  in             the Channel Tunnel  scheme, and should not be enlarged  to  form             one of the main traffic tunnels.  This tunnel  (and  the drainage             tunnel)  would be  lined throughout, and if  constructed with the             diameter which they recommend, it  would provide sufficient width             for the temporary railways which would  be  required during  its             construction for  the disposal of the spoil and subsequently during             the construction  of  the  main  tunnels.   It  would  also  allow             sufficient  space  for the  pipes used  for  ventilation  and  other             purposes  during  construction.   They recommend that the  pilot             tunnel should be  fitted with  the  necessary  electrical  equipment,             and,  after the  construction of  the  main tunnels, should  be  used             for the conveyance of men and material  required for the main-.            tenance of the tunnels and of  the permanent  way and electrical             equipment.  From the point where the drainage tunnel approaches             the pilot tunnel,  they suggest that  at fairly frequent intervals             connections should be  made between the two.  They  estimate that             the pilot and drainage tunnels  could be driven in about five years             on the  assumption that rotary excavators  were employed  in  each             case.   There is general agreement among witnesses that, on the             successful  completion of the pilot and drainage tunnels, it should             be possible to construct the main traffic tunnels in  a considerably             shorter time,  as work could  be carried on simultaneously  on a             considerable number of faces.   The Consulting Engineers consider             that three years should suffice  for the construction and equipment             of the main  traffic tunnels.  The whole operation, including the             construction of the pilot and drainage tunnels could, therefore, in             their  view, be carried out  in a period of eight years.
                 (d.) The Disposal of the Spoil.   60.  The scheme recommended  by  the Consulting Engineerscontemplates that the  spoil would  be  disposed of by  waggons.Various witnesses have, however, suggested that  by the additionof water it might be possible to  reduce the excavated material toa  slurry capable  of being pumped  out  of  the tunnel.  In  his evidence before  us,  Monsieur  Javary strongly  urged upon  us the  desirability  of  investigating  a   scheme   elaborated   byMonsieur  Fougerolles   for  the   disposal  of the  spoil.   If  thelatter&apos;s  estimates  were  in  fact   realised,   a   very  materialreduction would  be secured  in the  cost  of constructing  thetunnel.  In view  of the importance  attached to this  question  byMonsieur Javary,  we decided in drawing up the terms  of referenceto  the  Consulting  Engineers   to  invite  them  to  express   an opinion on the  feasibility of Monsieur Fougerolles&apos;  proposals.  TheConsulting Engineers discussed  this plan with representatives ofMonsieur Fougerolles, but  in their report  (Section  (1) (d) (ii)) theyare unable to express any  view on it until  a trial has been  madeunder  conditions similar to those which would obtain in the actualconstruction of  the  Channel  Tunnel.  The scheme  contemplatesthe  employment  of  a  rotary  tunnelling  machine  substantiallysimilar to those  used on the London underground railways.   Inpractice, it  has been found  that these  machines  can  excavate sorapidly that the main difficulty has been  the disposal of the spoil.The scheme proposes  that this  difficulty should  be overcome  bytreating the debris with water in such proportions  as would reduceit to a slurry that could be pumped out on to  the bed of the sea.This would be done by borings to  the sea-bed lined  with steel tubes.The Consulting  Engineers suggest  that  arrangements  might  bemade for Monsieur Fougerolles to test the efficacy  of his scheme inthe heading driven  under  the sea on the French side  about  theyear 1880.  In view of the large economies that would be effectedif the  system  could be successfully employed, they  recommendthat the carrying out of this trial, of which they understand  thecost would be about   40,000, should be carefully considered before any decision was taken  to  dispose of the spoil, in the ordinary wayby waggons.                  (e.)  The Cost of the Tunnel.                  (i.)  The Cost of Construction.    61.   At our request, the Consulting Engineers have prepared anindependent estimate of the cost of a Channel Tunnel.  As has been shown in paragraph 59,  the scheme which  they recommend includes the construction not only of two  independent traffic tunnels with adiameter of 18 feet 6 inches, but also of permanent pilot and drainagetunnels.  It consists in effect  of  a system of four  independenttunnels.  Such a scheme must necessarily be more costly than  anythat contemplated only three tunnels, namely,  two traffic tunnelsand either a drainage  or a pilot  tunnel.  The estimates submittedby the Channel  Tunnel Company are  therefore not strictly com-parable with those  prepared by the Consulting Engineers.   TheCompany estimate, for their scheme,  an expenditure of  5,000,000for the pilot tunnel, but in their evidence the Southern Railwayexpress the view that this figure should be increased to  6,000,000,as in their opinion it would be desirable to have  two pilot headings.Q?he estimate prepared by the Consulting Engineers for the drainageand pilot  tunnels combined  is   5,600,000.   In  considering  theestimates of the  probable  cost of  the  main traffic tunnels, it isimportant to define the items which have been included and thosewhich have been  excluded.  Under the scheme, as we understandit, the cost of providing the English and French exchange stations,the open approaches from  the mouth  of the tunnel to the exchangestations, the electrical locomotives, the necessary rolling stock,  andsuch electric generating stations and land as may be required will fall to be met respectively by the Southern Railway and the Chemin deFer du Nord, and will not  form charges on the British and FrenchChannel Tunnel Companies.  The latter Companies will, however,
we understand, be required to provide the funds necessary for thedisposal of the excavation by specially designed waggons  and fordumping it  into the sea.  They will  also be responsible  for  theconstruction of the works,  permanent way, electrical  equipment and sub-stations,  signalling, &amp;c.  Finally they will require to findinterest  during  construction   on  the  capital  employed.   Onthis  basis,  the  Channel  Tunnel  Company and the  southern railway  respectively  estimate  that  the cost of  the main traffictunnels (including  interest  on  capital  during  construction)  will amount  to   25,000,000  and   24,000,000.    The  consulting engineers&apos;  estimate provides  for  electrical equipment sufficientto enable a 10-minute  service if necessary  to be run at certaintimes  of  the  day.    On  this  and  the  other  assumptionsindicated  above,  they  calculate  that  the  cost   of  the   twotraffic  tunnels would be   24,850,000.  The  total  cost of the fourtunnels is therefore  estimated  by the Consulting  Engineers  at 80,450,000.  The difference between this figure and  that given bythem in No. 6 of their summary  of conclusions is accounted for bythe fact  that in the latter figure they have included an  item of 450,000 in respect of the open  approaches  from  each end of theTunnel to the Exchange Stations which, for  the reasons explained above, we have excluded from our calculations.          (ii.) The  Cost of Operation  and  Maintenance.   62.  Considerable diversity of opinion was expressed by variouswitnesses regarding the  probable cost of the maintenance of theTunnel.   The Channel  Tunnel Company themselves  submitted anestimate of  1,000,000 per annum, but they admitted that therewas  a  large element of  speculation in this figure.   In reaching it,they had made what they regarded as an excessive allowance under each of the several heads of expenditure,  and,  in addition,  had added  a  large sum for contingencies.   They expressed themselves as confident that, in fact, the cost would be substantially less thanthat figure.  The Southern Railway  stated that they  had greatdifficulty in putting forward  any figure.  The most that they felt able to do was to suggest, that for purposes of calculation,  the costof maintenance and operation might be taken as roughly equivalentto 40 per cent, of the gross revenue earned by the Tunnel.  they said  that assuming that the Tunnel earned  1,626,668, the working expenses on this basis would amount to  650,668 per  annum.   TheChemin de Fer du Nord  submitted for our consideration a series ofcalculations in which they draw  attention to the fact that working expenses  fall  into  two  categories, namely, those which dependdirectly on, and those  which are independent of, the volume oftraffic.  After making deductions for  the receipts of restaurant  cardues and applying a correction in respect of the English half of theTunnel on account of the higher  cost of living in this  country, they reach  the conclusion that the total working expenses would amount in round figures to 60,000,000 francs.  Their estimate of revenue is310,000,000 francs, so that, on their  calculation,  working expenseswould amount to not more than 19 per cent, of the gross revenue.   63.  The Consulting Engineers express the view (Section (1) (a)(i) and (ii)) that no difficulty need be apprehended regarding  themaintenance of the Tunnel, which  would be  lined throughout.  in sections where the ground contained water, the joints of the lining would be caulked.   Such small leakages as  would occur could, in their opinion, be dealt with by the water being led to the drainagetunnel for pumping.   Similarly, - they  do not  anticipate  anyserious difficulty regarding the maintenance of the permanent way.They  point out  that there is less corrosion of the rails,  &amp;c, in a tunnel where the traffic is worked  electrically than in the open.The inspection and repair of the tracks would have to be carriedout  mainly at night,  and would require  careful  organisation  forthe transport of men and materials.  It is for this service that  the pilot  tunnel (paragraph 59) would be  principally used  after  theopening of  the tunnel.   64.  As regards the operation of the railway, electric tractionand  automatic signalling would  be adopted.  The running of  the trains themselves would, in the  view of the  Consulting Engineers,
create sufficient  ventilation, which could be regulated by openingsinto the pilot tunnel.  If this  proved  to be insufficient, it could,they suggest, be supplemented  by propeller fans, the pilot tunnelbeing used to convey air to the running tunnels.    65.  The Consulting Engineers have, at our request, speciallyconsidered the probable cost of the operation  and  upkeep of theTunnel,  and  report  that  on  the assumption that the  electriclocomotives  and rolling-stock are owned and  maintained  by the operating Railway Companies,  they   are  of opinion  that  theexpenditure thereon  would not  reach a  sum of   500,000  perannum.  This figure  includes the cost of the electricity necessaryto maintain a ten-minute  service,  if necessary,  at &quot;certain times of  the  day, but  does not include the cost of  constructing  agenerating station on  the English side, as they assume that by thedate that a Channel Tunnel could be opened  the necessary  currentcould be obtained from  the national  scheme  under the  central electricity  Board (the &quot;Grid&quot;).                 YI. TRAFFIC PROBLEMS.                     (a.) Passenger Traffic.(i.) Probable Volume of Boat Traffic at the date of the opening of      a Tunnel, and Amount of that Traffic which a Tunnel might      be expected to secure.   66.  One of the  most difficult of our tasks has been to obtain a  reliable  estimate  of  the probable  volume  of  cross-Channelpassenger traffic in the year  of the opening of1 a Tunnel, and of theproportion  of  that  traffic which a  Tunnel might be expected tosecure.  In dealing with this part  of our subject  we have thoughtit convenient in the first place to set out briefly the estimates whichhave been placed before us  by the Channel Tunnel Company, bythe Southern  Railway,  and  by the Chemin de Fer  du Nord, andthen to state the conclusions  which we have ourselves reached.(a.) Estimate  by the Channel Tunnel  Company.   67.  The   following  calculation  submitted  to   us  by  theChannel Tunnel Company is based upon the assumption  that thenumber of  cross-Channel  passengers,  which  they  estimate  at,500,000, may be expected to increase at the  rate of 5 per cent.simple per annum;  that the  earliest date upon which a Tunnelcould be  opened  would  be  January  1986,   and that  on thatdate  the   total  number  of  cross-Channel  passengers  would exceed the  present  total  of   2,500,000  by 35  per  cent., i.e.,875,000.   On  this  basis,   the total  number of  passengers  inthat   year   would  be  3,875,000.    The   Company   assume that  of this  total  the  Tunnel  would  secure 80  per  cent,  ofthe  passenger  traffic   using  the  harbours of  Folkestone andDover, i.e., 80 per  cent,  of  1,000,000 = 800,000.   They furtherassume that 80 per  cent, of the normal  increase in the numberof passengers  using  those  harbours would  use the  Tunnel, i.e.,80 per cent, of 35  per cent,  of  1,000,000 = 280,000 passengers.As regards the 1,500,000 passengers at present  using  other routes,the Company  assume a diversion  to the Tunnel of  40 per cent.,i.e.,  600,000 passengers.  They further assume that  40 per cent.in the normal increase of  this traffic would also be attracted tothe  Tunnel,  i.e., 40   per  cent,  of  85 per  cent,  of 1,500,000passengers = 210,000  passengers.    In  addition to the  foregoingtraffics, the  Company  assume  that the effect of a Tunnel wouldbe to  raise  the number  of foreigners crossing  the  Channel tothat  of British subjects so doing,  and that  the  whole  of this increased  traffic would be  carried by  the  Tunnel.   At  present,three British  subjects  to one  foreigner cross  the Channel, and,on this proportion,  out of  the estimated  3,875,000 passengers in1986, 2,581,250 would  be British subjects and 848,750 would beforeigners.   If the  Company&apos;s assumption is  correct, the latter
figure  would be increased by  1,687,500.   The conclusions of theCompany may  therefore  be summarised  as  follows :      80 per cent, of  the 1,000,000 passengers  using          the harbours of Folkestone and  Dover (i.e.,          4/5ths of 1,000,000) ...     ...     ...     ...  =    800,000     80 per cent,  of the estimated increaso  in seven          vears in this traffic (i.e., 4/5ths of 35  per cent.          of 1,000,000)       ......     ...     ...  =    280,000     40 per cent, of  passenger traffic carried by other          routes (i.e., 2/5ths of  1,500,000)     ...     ...  =    600,000     40 per cent,  of the estimated  increase  in seven          years  of this  traffic  (i.e.,  40 per  cent, of          35 per cent, of 1,500,000)  .........=    210,0001,890,000Estimated increase in number of  foreigners who    would use the Tunnel     ...      ...      ...     1,687,500                    Total in 1936  .........     3,577,500(b.) Estimate  by the  Southern Railway.    68.   The  Southern Railway place the  number  of  fare-payingpassengers embarking and disembarking by the various Continentalroutes in 1928 at 2,345,864.   Of this they  estimate the numbercarried between  Folkestone and Boulogne and Dover and Calais inthat year at 1,043,727.   On this  basis the  Southern  Railway havefurnished  us  with the  following table  showing the  number  of passengers that  they  anticipate might be attracted to a Tunnel inits  first year of working if that year was 1936.  It will be observedthat  the  Company assume  a normal increase in  the number of passengers of  192,745 for the period  1928  to 1936.   This increasecorresponds to an annual progression of 23 per cent, compound.In  considering the possible  traffics that would  be diverted fromother routes,  the percentages given  are based upon the presentvolume  of  those  traffics  without  any  allowance  for  increase between the present time and the opening of a Tunnel.   This tablefurther assumes that  the-steamboat services that now run betweenDover and Calais and Folkestone  and Boulogne  would have to  be entirely abandoned for the reason that, though  a  certain numberof passengers  would still wish to  make use of the sea passage, thenumber would be  insufficient  to  enable the boat  services to  becontinued, except at  a serious loss.

These calculations assume that the tunnel  would be availablefor traffic in 1936.
 (c.) Estimate by the Chemin de Fer du Nord.    69.  The  Chemin de Per du  Nord have adopted  the  following principles  in  estimating  the  volume of passenger traffic  likely to be secured by the Tunnel.  An examination of the passenger traffic from 1894 to 1913 between England and the Continent between the Ports  of the  Channel  and North  Sea  combined  shows a uniform average rate  of  increase throughout the  whole  period.   The Company  have  submitted in  support  of  this view  a   graph (see   Appendix   V)   showing   on   a  logarithmic  scale   the annual  number  of  passengers   during  that   period   and  the mean   rate   of  increased   They  have  assumed  that  each of the mean  points  corresponds  to the number of  passengers of the previous  year  increased  by a constant co-efficient.  On this view the curve may be regarded as that represented by  a  capital sum of money put  out at  compound interest, the rate of interest being  the  co-efficient of  increase  allowed   for  the number  of passengers.   On this hypothesis the logarithms of  the  ordinates of the curve  fall on a straight  line  whose  gradient will  be the co-efficient in question.    70.  The  Company  claim  that they have verified this  hypo- thesis  and that the broken line of logarithms has, in fact,  as an actual trace a straight line whose gradient is 4-11 per cent.   They further claim  that though the co-efficient is not the same,  the same principle has  been  found to govern the growth of the total  traffic of the Nord system and of the total traffic of the combined railways of Prance.  In his evidence before us, Monsieur Javary, the General Manager of the Nord,  expressed his conviction that this empirical law of the increase  of railway traffic  corresponded  to a  law  of nature.    71.  The Company assume  that the 1st January,  1940,  is the earliest date on which a Tunnel could be opened, and,  applying their co-efficient of 4-11 per cent., they  conclude   that by  that time the  annual number of passengers passing between  England and the Continent  will be  3,721,000.   Of this total,  they assume that the following will be absorbed by the Tunnel:     The whole of the  traffic  by  the  following  routes  across  the       Channel:          Boulogne-Polkestone.          Calais-Dover.          Dunkirk-Tilbury.    75  per  cent, of  the traffic of the routes nearest to these, i.e.:          Dieppe-Newhaven.          Ostend-Dover.    50  per  cent,  of  the  traffic  of the  routes  a  little further       distant, i.e. :          Le Havre-Southampton.          Ant werp-Harwich. Arid from 30 per cent, to 35  per  cent,  of the traffic  on the other routes.    72.  As regards  the additional passenger cross-Channel  traffic directly due to the existence of a Tunnel,  the Chemin de Fer du Nord consider that the co-efficient of  4-11 per cent., which  they anticipate until the opening of a  Tunnel, can safely be doubled (i.e., raised to  8-22 per  cent.) for the first  five years  after its opening as a result of the powerful stimulus (coup de  fouet)  which a  Tunnel  would give to traffic.  The Company are convinced that this co-efficient is  by  no  means  exaggerated, since  the rate  of progression actually rose to  9-6 per cent, during the years 1920-24. The Chemin de Fer du Nord therefore estimate that the number of passengers who may be expected to use the Tunnel would amount to 3,200,000 in 1940, which  they assume would be the first year of its operation.   * On a &quot; logarithmic &quot; scale  equal proportional changes are represented by equal vertical distances in  all parts of the vertical scale, so that, inter alia, factors increasing  at a constant compound rate are represented bystraight lines, which are easier to interpret than the curved lines whichwould result from using an &quot; absolute &quot; scale.

(d.) Conclusions.   73.  The success of a Channel Tunnel is so largely dependent onthe volume of the traffic that it attracts that, in addition to givingthe views of the  principal witnesses  (paragraphs 67  to  72)  that have appeared before us, we have -thought it desirable  ourselves toundertake an independent investigation of this question. It is clear from evidence before us that there has been a  regular increase inthe number of passengers year by year on the bulk of the Channelservices.  This may be regarded as a normal development, following on the increase of population and  the growth of national and inter-national trade.   For the purpose of this study, we have adopted thefollowing classification of the facilities for Channel crossing providedby the railway companies :      (i.) Short sea daylight crossing by the two routes, Dover-Calais          and   Folkestone-Boulogne,   together  carrying  nearly          50 per cent, of the total Channel passenger  traffic.    (h.) Dover-Ostend  crossing,  which  carries  the  bulk  of  the          Belgian and Central European traffic.    (iii.) Newhaven-Dieppe and Tilbury-Dunkirk crossings, which          are popular and  cheap  crossings carrying  tourist traffic.    (iv.) Night  services,  to  Havre,  St.  Malo  and  Caen  from          Southampton, and several from Harwich  for the North          European traffic.Short Sea Route.   74.

The diagram  given in Appendix VI  has been constructedfrom  the  figures given in the preceding tables on a logarithmicscale  and shows the traffic year by year,  together with  a trendline   representing  the  average  progression  over  the  periodsindicated.   This diagram presents  a  more  comprehensive  andreliable  picture of the progression of the past.  It shows that theprogression  of the  short  sea service was at  the  annual rate of8-7 per cent, compound for the period 1850-73, that for the  period1873  to  1896 the progression  fell  to 0&apos;35  per cent,  per annum,that   thereafter,  until  1913,  the progression averaged  5-45  percent,  per annum, and that this rate  was  re-established in theperiod from 1924 to 1928.  In the  case of the passengers carried by  all  cross-channel routes,  the  compound  rate of progressionregistered for the  period 1850  to 1873 was  4&apos;7 per  cent,  perannum.  During the period&apos; 1873-98 there was a  slowing  down inthe rate of progression  to an average of 32 per cent, per annum,but from 1898 to 1913 the rate increased to an average of 4&quot;45 percent.  per annum,  which  rate has been repeated in the  period1924-28.   The  average for  all services  during the  whole  period under review of 1850 to 1928  (excluding the period 1914-23, beingthe years affected by the war) shows a progression of 4-0 per cent.per annum compound.Traffic in 1988.   79.  It will  be observed that  the  average compound  rate of increase over the whole period (1850-1928) is  lower in  nearly everyinstance than the comparative figures for the last two periods.  Itmay  well be that the latter rate of increase will be maintained for part at least of the next ten years. For the purpose of our calculationwe have, however, thought it prudent to adopt the least favourableview  of the  probable growth of Channel traffic.  We have thereforecalculated the probable volume of passenger traffic in 1938 by takingthe actual figures  for 1928 and increasing them at 4 per dfent. perannum  compound.   We think, however, that  it is  not unreasonable to assume that  the actual progression  will probably prove to be higher.   The figures  which we  give for  the 1928 traffic werefurnished to us by the Southern Eailway, and with the exception ofthose for the short sea  routes include all passengers carried in thatyear.  Of the 1,109,000 passengers  carried on the short sea routes,80,000 were passengers booked locally between English and French ports for  day excursions.   For  the present  purpose,  these excur-sionists should,  in our view,  be deducted from the total  number of passengers using these  routes.  We accordingly estimate that traffic at 1,029,000.  The figures for all routes also include persons holdingfree  passes,  e.g.,  railway officials  and  officers of  the  customs and police services.Total Traffic by all Routes.   78.  The passenger movement by all routes since 1850 (includ-ing that of holders of free-passes and that of day excursionists onthe short sea routes) has been as follows :

The  foregoing  table shows that  the number of persons crossing the Channel annually by  all  routes may be  expected  to increase from the figure  of 2,266,000 in 1928 to 3,852,000 in 1928, unless some wholly unanticipated factor causes a slowing down  of the usual rate of progression during that period.  We have selected the year 1938 for this comparison, as in our view it may be assumed that  this is the earliest  possible date on which a Channel Tunnel could be opened for traffic.    81.  . It remains for us to consider to what extent the probable passenger  traffic in 1938 would be diverted  from existing routes to the Tunnel route.  The Dover-Calais and  Folkestone-Boulogne routes  are  in  a  special  position,  as they  would be directly superseded by a Channel Tunnel.   As regards the other routes it is important, in considering the question of diversion,  to bear in mind that  a proportion  of the traffic consists  of  persons  who select a particular  route  because their destination  is  in  the immediate neighbourhood of the port of arrival.   Clearly,-local  traffic of this kind  is not likely  to be diverted to a  Tunnel  route to  the same extent as through traffic to  more distant destinations.   In  our calculations we have therefore made an apportionment  as between local  and through traffic.   On the Southern  Railway routes  the basis  that we  have  adopted  for this  purpose is  that  suggested to  us  by  the  Southern  Railway  Company,  except   on   the N&apos; ewhaven-Dieppe  route  as  regards  which  the  Company were not   in  a   position  to  submit   definite  figures.   For  that route  we  have  assumed  that  half  the  traffic  is  local  and half  through  traffic.   For   the  Harwich  routes,   we  have adopted  the  basis  suggested  by  the   London  and  North- Eastern  Railway  Company.   That Company  stated  that they anticipate a diversion to the Tunnel of 50 per cent,  of the whole of the through traffic on their  routes  and a diversion of 10 per cent,  of  the local  traffic, other than that to  Holland, from which they do not anticipate any diversion.  We  consider that this basis may be safely accepted for routes so far distant from the Tunnel as are those operated from Harwich.  As regards the routes nearer to  the   Tunnel,   we  think  that  the diversion  may   be  put at 75 per cent, of the  through traffic and  15  per  cent, of the local  traffic.   In the  light of  the foregoing  considerations,  we propose now to  examine the extent to which  diversion   may be expected  from each of the existing routes.   Dover-Calais and Folkestone-Boulogne. On  the opening of a Tunnel, a number of travellers would, no doubt, wish to go by sea,but their number  would probably not be sufficient to enable even a modified boat service to be maintained except at a heavy  loss.  Inany ease, it would  probably  be to the  interest  of  the companies concerned to close down the boat service completely  with a view to securing the whole of this traffic for the Tunnel.  We have  therefore assumed a diversion to the Tunnel of 100 per cent, of the passenger traffic on these routes.
   Dover-Ostend. The  Southern  Bailway state that the  totalnumber of passengers by  this  route  during 1928  amounted to411,000, of whom 76,000 (18-5 per cent.) proceeded  to Brusselsand beyond,  so that  835,000 (81-5 per cent.)  may be regardedas having booked to local destinations on  or  around the Belgiancoast.  We have apportioned local and through traffic on the abovebasis  in calculating  the probable  diversion   from  this  route.Assuming that the volume of this traffic will increase  at 4 per cent.per annum compound till 1938 and that 15 per cent, of the localtraffic will be diverted and 75 per cent, of the through  traffic, thetotal  diversion  that  may be   anticipated  amounts  to  158,000passengers  out of a total of  608,000,  i.e.,  26 per cent, of thewhole.   Newhaven-Dieppe. We have assumed  that  on this route half is local and half through traffic.  On this and the other assumptionsadopted for the Dover-Ostend  route,  it may be anticipated thatin 1938, 172,000 out of 883,000 passengers  would be  diverted fromthis route to the Channel Tunnel, i.e., 45 per cent,  of  the whole.   Tilbury-Dunhirk. The London, Midland and Scottish BailwayCompany  assume  that  the  diversion to  the   Tunnel would  be equivalent  to  the  difference between the  present  number of passengers  (79,000  in  1928)  and the number of such  passengersin 1936.  If  the traffic  progresses at the  rate  of 4  per cent, perannum  compound, it would amount in that year to  117,000.  Onthis  basis,  the diversion  would amount to  32 per cent, of thewhole,  which  is the  same percentage as  that  suggested  by theSouthern Bailway.   Harwich-Hook   and  Harwich-Flushing. The   London  and north-Eastern Railway Company state that in 1928, out of 169,000passengers  carried  on the Hanvich-Hook route, 85,000 .can beregarded as local and 84,000 proceeded to Germany and Switzerland.As regards the Harwich-Flushing route, the Company state that outof 64,000 passengers, 26,000 were  local and 38,000 proceeded toGermany and Switzerland.  We accept their view that no diversion to the Tunnel route can be looked for from the local traffic but thatof the through  traffic  50 per cent, would  probably be diverted.If the traffic  on each of  these routes increases at 4 per cent, perannum  compound until  1938 the  through traffic  would  amount in that year to 124,000 on  the Hook route and 56,000 on theFlushing route.  On the basis that we have adopted the diversion to be expected would therefore be 90,000 passengers.   Harwich-Antwerp  and  Harwich-Zeebrugge. We  accept theview of the London &amp; North Eastern Bailway Company that therewould be a diversion to the Tunnel route of 10 per cent,  of the totalpassenger traffic  carried by  these  routes.   The traffic on  these routes amounted in 1928 to 92,000 passengers,  and  if it increasesat 4 per cent, per annum compound until 1938 it will have reached135,000 in that year.  The diversion that we anticipate on these routes amounts therefore to approximately 18,000 passengers.   if to this figure is added the number  (90,000) of passengers expectedto be diverted from the Hook and Flushing routes, it will be seenthat the total diversion on  the four Harwich routes would be103,000 passengers out  of a  total  of  479,000,  i.e., 21 per cent.of the whole.    Southampton-St. Malo and Caen. We do not put the diversion to the Tunnel on this route higher than 15 per cent.    Southampton-Havre. The Southern Bailway state that, out of65,000  passengers in 1928, 22,000  booked to Paris, 8,000 to otherdistant parts of France and 35,000 to places in the neighbourhood ofHavre.   On this basis, a diversion  of 75 per cent, of  the  throughtraffic and  15 per cent, of the local traffic would amount to 42,000passengers, if  the  traffic on this  route increases at  4 per cent.per  annum compound to 1938, i.e., a diversion of 43 per cent.of the whole.    Gravesend-Rotterdam. We  do  not anticipate any  diversion tothe Tunnel from this route.    In the following table will be found particulars  regarding thepresent traffic, both local and through, on each of the  several routes,the  estimated  amount  of  such traffic in  1938, the estimates  of diversion of passengers.from these routes to a Channel Tunnel that have been submitted to us, and our conclusions thereon.

   82.  On the foregoing basis we estimate that if 1988  was thefirst  year in which the tunnel was used, the  number of passengersdiverted to it  would be 2,052,000.  There is, however, a furtherfactor which, though difficult to gauge, would no doubt operate toincrease that figure.  Experience shows that whenever an important new  travel  facility is introduced, e.g.,  the  opening of new  throughservices, the introduction of third-class sleepers, &amp;c, there is a net increase in the volume of traffic after all allowance has been madefor diversion from other routes or other services.   As has  been shown (paragraph 67), the Channel Tunnel Company estimate thatthis new traffic attracted solely by the facilities offered by the tunnel would amount to 1,687,500.   The Southern  Railway, however,  donot anticipate that it will exceed 15 per cent, of the short sea traffic,i.e.,  173,471, on the basis adopted in their calculation of the  prob-able  volume of that traffic, or 228,000 if allowance is made for thenormal growth of traffic between the present time and the date ofthe opening of the Tunnel on the routes from which diversion maybe expected.   The  Chemin de  Per  du  Nord  assume  that theco-efficient  of increase for the first five years will be 8-22 per cent.,instead of the normal rate of 4&apos;11 per cent.  They calculate thaton this basis the number of passengers likely to be carried by theTunnel route  will be 3,200,000 in 1940,  which  they assume willbe the first year of its  operation.  The Nord  Railway base this conclusion  on  two  grounds.   They  accept  the view referred  toabove  that  a  Channel  Tunnel,  like  any  other  new  travellingfacility, will  tend to  produce a  new  class of  travelling  public.Further, they consider that this increase would be larger in the caseof a Channel Tunnel than it would be in that of a  similar new travelfacility between two  countries having land  frontiers. It is commonknowledge  that  foreigners of the European nations do not for themost  part  willingly  undertake journeys involving a sea  crossingand that  this distaste for the  sea  is an  important factor  in  deter -ring  many  from visiting this country.   A Channel Tunnel  wouldentirely eliminate this  factor and would,  they  believe,  act  as asubstantial  stimulus  to the  foreign tourist traffic to  this country.On the other hand,  some witnesses  have  expressed the view thata Tunnel might  cause larger numbers of  British subjects to visit the Riviera, Switzerland and other places  on the Continent duringthe winter  months,  but that owing to the absence in this country of attractions  of  the type sought by foreigners  at holiday resorts,the numbers of foreigners visiting this country for holiday purposeswould not be likely materially to increase.   Witnesses holding thisview have  further pointed out that,  in that event, on balance a tunnel  would  aggravate the  present  disproportion between the sums spent abroad  by  British subjects  and those similarly  spent in this country by  foreigners.  These are necessarily matters ofconjecture, but it is not unreasonable  to  assume that some increase may be looked  for  in the number of foreign visitors  due to  thefacilities  offered  by  a Channel Tunnel.   88.  In view of  their great experience of  the  effect of theintroduction of  new facilities  on the  volume of  traffic carried,  weinvited  the   co-operation   of  the   International  Sleeping  CarCompany.  Monsieur Garcey, Head of the Commercial Branch, inhis evidence  before  us  stated that the experience of his companyshowed that for the  period 1904-28 the  annual rate of progressionamounted  to 4  per  cent.  He added  that for the first  five  yearsafter the opening of the tunnel  that  rate would,  in his view, be substantially increased.  It would, he believed, amount to as  muchas 8 per cent, per annum.   84.  There  is, in addition, the question of  the effect  whicha  Channel  Tunnel might have on the American tourist traffic to europe.   Of  recent  years  American  tourists  have tended  to  an increasing  extent to disembark at the ports of  Southern europe and  to reimbark for America  at the  Northern French ports.  Inmost cases Americans following this route  omit a visit to England.From the best figures that we have been  able to obtain it appearsprobable that  in 1927 250,000 Americans who visited Europe  didnot visit this  country.   The view has been  put before  us that ifthere were  a Channel Tunnel a larger  number of American tourists
would disembark  at  Southampton  in  preference  to  doing so  atCherbourg as  at present.   It has also been suggested  to us that ifthere were  a  Channel  Tunnel the present tendency  of Americantourists to disembark at the ports of Southern Europe  would be reversed,  and that a larger proportion of American  tourists  and business men would use  the  Northern route on their  outwardjourney, and the Southern  route (Genoa and Naples) on their return journey.  It has also been suggested that the facilities provided by aChannel Tunnel may well lead to Liverpool regaining some of its former  importance in  the  Transatlantic passenger traffic.   It  is pointed out that  the  sea  passage from  Liverpool to Montreal via the North of Ireland route would mean  a saving of practically one day  on the sea passage,   that^it  would be particularly attractivefor passengers from or  to  Chicago and  the Middle West and  that,if there was a direct train  connection by the tunnel route between england and the principal European cities, this route would offer a  definite  saving  of time.   We do not wish to attach undueimportance to  these arguments, but  we  think that if there were aChannel Tunnel there  might be some  increase in the number  ofAmericans visiting this country.   85.  Any estimate of  the increase  in  passenger cross-channeltraffic directly attributable  to  the existence  of  a Channel  Tunnelmust necessarily  be  speculative, but,  taking all the  foregoingfactors  into consideration,  we  consider that  the estimate of theChannel Tunnel Company is too high,  and  that of the  SouthernEailway too low.   On  the whole we think  that it would not be unreasonable  to assume in  the  first year of the operation  of aChannel Tunnel  a probable increase of passengers equivalent  to20 per cent, of the probable volume  at  that date of the short seatraffic, viz., 305,000 passengers.   86.  For the purposes of comparison we set out in the followingtable the  probable  traffic  on the basis  (a)  of  the diversion factorssuggested to us by the  Southern Eailway, (b) on  the  same basis,with  the  number  of passengers  adjusted  as indicated  in para-graph 82, and (c) on the basis which we consider  reasonable.   Asshown in  this table we conclude that if a Channel Tunnel  were opened  to traffic on the  1st January,  1938, it might be expected tosecure in that  year 2,357,000 passengers : ESTIMATE of Passengers through Channel  Tunnel.Tunnel open for Traffic on J anuary 1st.	1936.		1938.		1938.

                        (ii.) Air  Traffic.   87.  In the foregoing paragraphs we have considered  only  theChannel passenger traffic  carried  by boat.  Recent years have,however, witnessed a substantial growth of air travel between thiscountry and the Continent.  The  number  of passengers carried ineach of the last four completed years is as follows :                                              Passengers           Year.                               carried.           1925     ............     20,721           1926     ............     25,524           1927     ............     28,764           1928     ............     43,179A further increase was  expected for 1929&apos; and again in  the nearfuture when it is found  possible to introduce night services on  theair lines.   88.  It will be seen  from the  above figures that cross-Channelair traffic  has developed  rapidly  in recent  years,  and  that  itsvolume is likely  still  further  to increase.   The  total  figuresrepresent, however, only a very small proportion of the total cross-Channel passenger traffic.  The rates at  present  charged for  the journey  from London  to  Paris  by  air are  slightly higher thanthose for the  same journey first class by train and boat, but  are less than those charged on the de luxe (Golden Arrow) boat service.It is, however, important  to bear  in  mind that the fares charged by the air  lines in  this country  and on the Continent are  noteconomic rates, and are only rendered possible  by  the  existenceof Government subsidies.  It is not possible to estimate what wouldbe the effect on the existing volume of air traffic  if these subsidieswere withdrawn.   It cannot, however, be  doubted  that there wouldbe some immediate contraction accompanied by a  slowing down inthe present annual rate of progression.  Civilian air services have notin fact emerged from the period  of initial struggle,  and  have yet to face conditions of open competition.  We do not doubt  that theywill do so successfully when that time comes, but we believe thatfor the  present and for many years to  come  they are unlikely to  offer  serious  competition  to  railway transport.   Prom  theestimates submitted to us, it appears probable that two out of everythree of the persons who now use the London-Paris air  route aremen travelling on business.  We think that in the main  this is the class  of passenger  who  is likely in an increasing degree to travelby air in preference to going by rail.   The higher cost and greaterdiscomfort of  air travel  are not likely to  act  as deterrents in viewof the  business  advantages  offered  by  more  rapid  travelling.Comfort and safety depend on the accidents of weather just as theboat  services  do,  and in  that   respect  air services  share  the disadvantage of the boat services.  Speed  to some extent  outweighsthis consideration.   In so far  as this view  proves to be correct,the progressive development of  air  services  may be expected  tobe of benefit to the countries between which they are operated, andby affording better means of communication  to  act  as a stimulus to trade between those  countries.   Air lines  are  not likely ever to compete  with boat and rail transport for  the  carriage  of heavygoods.  Increases in  the  volume of international  trade due  to development  of air travel for  business purposes are likely to  be reflected -in  increases of  railway-borne goods  traffic between countries connected with air services.    89.  In general we  consider that, as  regards  passenger traffic, the London-Paris air services are not likely to be affected adversely by the advent of  a Channel Tunnel.   These services will no doubt develop considerably during the next ten years, but we do not think that they are likely to offer serious competition to a Channel Tunnel. As regards the carriage of goods, air services at present only compete with other forms of transport in special commodities of high value or those commodities  for  which rapidity of transport is  sufficiently important to outweigh  the higher cost.   Some of the&apos; latter traffic might be diverted to a Channel Tunnel.   From the point of view of the Tunnel,  we do not think that air competition for goods traffic would prove a serious factor.
                       (b.) Goods Traffic.   90.  As in the case  of passenger traffic, a considerable volumeof goods traffic will be provided for a Channel Tunnel by the closing down of existing  Southern Railway  Steamship services and theirtransfer to  the tunnel  route.   The  extent to  which a  tunnelmight be  expected to attract goods traffic  at present  moving byother routes will  naturally depend in  large  measure on the rates which it offers.  Changes in rates charged for transport movement,like other charges made for goods or services rendered, do not alwaysresult in proportionate increases or decreases  in the volume of salesor commodities moved,  as  such  resultant  alterations in volumedepend also upon the demand.  For example, a 20 per cent, reduc-tion in the rates  charged for a commodity produced in the  Southof France might  be- sufficient  to double  the  demand  for thatcommodity in London.  There are, however, other important factors to which due weight must be given.  These include speed, elimination -tion  of  handling,  reduction of  packing,  insurance rates and reduction  of liability to claims.   If the charges made for the useof a Channel Tunnel were founded solely upon the basis of making ita profitable  investment, there would  be little  risk in the early stages of  high charges,  as  the  level of rates would be so set asto induce  the  maximum possible freight movement,  though, later,rates might tend to rise. The rates which a railway  can charge forthe   goods  which  it  carries  depend  partly  on  their  value and   partly   on  the  competition,  either   of   markets  or  ofrival   means  of  transport   with  which   it  is   faced.   Evenin  Great  Britain  there  are few railway  rates which are not limited by coastwise steamer or road vehicle competition.  Cross-Channel rates are not  in reality  cross-Channel rates, but Paris-London rates  for certain  classes of traffic, or  Calais-Boulogne-London rates  for  other types of  traffic.  The latter rates are setprimarily  by water competition from.the  French Channel ports tothe Thames;  the former are set, in the case of valuable traffic,to some  extent by air  competition.   The unexpected  competitive power of air transport is well illustrated by an example which was brought to our notice in which a firm in the Midlands found itprofitable  to transport  light steel castings of  high value to andfrom Switzerland  by air.   We  understand  that in this case thedetermining factor was  the  speed and regularity of  the service.As  regards the Calais-London and  Boulogne-London  routes, thesituation  is  complicated by  the  fact that the  Southern Railwayowns both  cross-Channel  steamers  and  railway routes betweenDover and Folkestone  and London.   Rates are therefore  quotedfrom the French Channel ports to London, and it is  not possible toascertain  upon what proportions such revenue is divided betweenrailways and steamers.    91.  Of the goods traffic which might be attracted to the Tunnelthat at present passing through Dover, Folkestone and  Newhaven isof particular importance.  Details  of that  traffic for  1927  are givenin Appendix III.   These figures  are  derived from the  &quot;AnnualStatement of  the  Trade of  the United Kingdom&apos;&apos;  issued for thatyear.  Excluding imports of coal in  1926 and 1927  the trade maybe summarised as &quot;follows : -r	Imports.	British Exports.	Re-exports.1923-27- Average. Dover Folkestone Newhaven...

In Table I of Appendix  III, imported goods in 1927  areclassed as (a)  perishable articles,  (b) valuable and fragile articles,and (c) other goods.  The classification  is only a rough one, and itmay well appear that motor cars, cycles, rubber goods, and electrical[20852]  .                                         F 2
                              goods should have been included in class (b), raising the value of                              imports in that class from  17,890,000 to  18,777,000.  Tables II                              and III show the main groups of exports and re-exports.                                 93.  The  largest single  class of goods  imported through  the                              three ports consisted of textiles and  apparel and amounted in value                              to  17,540,000, or nearly 53-4 per cent, of the total imports, while                              exports of British-made textile  goods and apparel were  valued at                               8,807,000.  Of these exports about one-third ( 1,290,000) passed                              through Newhaven-Dieppe, apparently for convenience of distribu-                              tion  locally or to the centre and  south  of Prance, and would                              therefore probably not be  diverted to a Channel  Tunnel.                                 94.  We think it reasonable to  expect that a Channel Tunnel                              service would reduce costs of transport (including packing, breaking                              bulk,  port  dues, insurance, &amp;e.)   sufficiently to divert  to  it  a                              considerable part of existing imports from the Continent  which are                              at present  brought in by  other routes.  In  order to obtain some                              concrete evidence on this question,  we obtained in November  1929                              a number of quotations on specified articles  for particular routes.                              The wide variation in these  quotations is very striking and consti-                              tutes a severe handicap to  exporters.   In the  case,  for  example,                              of Berlin to Bedford, such  widely  differing  rates as  4 15s.  Ad.                              and  7 0s. 9d. per ton were found.   In another case (Birmingham                              to Barcelona) the rates varied from  3  15s.  Id.  to  7 8s. 9d. per                              ton.   These variations led to an examination of hypothetical rail-                              way rates between these centres over an all railway  route  through                              the  tunnel, on the assumption that existing railway  rates would                              apply for the through journey with a  suitable addition for the portion                              of the journey in the Channel Tunnel.  The examination showed that                              to produce  rates competitive with  those now charged by  existing                              rail  cum sea routes  the  additional charge  for the Tunnel would                              not  be so great as to be outside the normal range of competitive                              rate quoting.   The possibility must therefore  be reckoned with that                              the  Channel Tunnel  route by rating alone apart from the  advan-                              tages of  speed, regularity of service, and avoidance of  handling,                              might successfully compete  for traffic between the  Midlands  and                              continental towns other than that carried  at present through the                              Channel  Ports.  In this  connection it is interesting to  note that                              the  elimination  of  the  sea crossing by  the establishment of  a                              through rail connection between  this  country  and the  Continent                              would have the  effect of creating  an all-rail route between (say)                              London and important centres in Northern Prance such as  Lille.                              By the Tunnel route the distance to London from Lille would ber                              approximately  170   miles  as  compared with  190   miles  from                              Manchester, 196 miles from Hull and 220 miles from Leeds.                                 95.   Our general  conclusion is  that for imports  the Tunnel                              would secure  a substantial traffic at present rates in  view of the                              greater speed and regularity of its  service compared with that of                              its  competitors,  though  bulky and less profitable  traffic would                              continue  to use  the  sea route.   The same factors would operate                              in the  case of  exports.  On the Channel routes  imports largely                              exceed  exports,  and this  might  well  prompt  the  companies                              operating  the  Tunnel  to  offer   specially  attractive  rates  to                              exporters, more particularly as they  would otherwise  have  to                              return trucks empty to the Continent.   By  doing so they would                              do  something  to balance their  traffic, and  would tend  to secure                              freight at present carried by shipping companies.  Prom the esti-                              mates with  which we have been  furnished it appears that the goods                              traffic conveyed  by regular  routes  between  England  and Prance                              and  Belgium  which  would  be  susceptible  to competition  by  a                              Channel Tunnel amounted in 1928 to about 580,000 tons excluding                              that carried by the Harwich-Zeebrugge train  ferry.  Of this traffic,                              only  about  22  per cent, was carried by the  Southern Bailway on                              the Dover-Calais and Folkestone-Boulogne routes.   The Southern                              Bailway estimate that the receipts obtained by a Channel Tunnel                              in respect of  goods in the  first year of operation would show an                              increase of 50  per cent, over those  now obtained on the two boat                              services referred to above.   Tonnage alone is  admittedly not a good                              guide to the value of freight, but we think that this estimate is  a                              moderate one.
               YII__ECONOMIC  QUESTIONS.                       (a.) Employment.   96.  We have devoted special consideration to the effects whichthe construction of a Channel Tunnel might be expected to have onthe volume of employment.   97.  The Consulting Engineers estimate that the building  ofthe British half of the pilot and drainage tunnels would give direct employment to an average of 250 men per annum,  spread  overa  period of five  years.   On  the completion of this  stage,  they   iestimate that for the remaining (three-year) period when the maintraffic tunnels would be under construction, direct employment wouldbe given to an  average  of 1,550 men on the British section of theTunnel.   In addition, further direct employment  of  which  it  isdifficult to estimate the amount, would be required for the provisionof the exchange station at  Sandling,and for such other develop-ments as the Southern Railway might undertake.   98.  It will  thus be seen that the amount of direct  employmentafforded by the scheme is relatively  small.   Its  indirect  effect,however, on employment in the iron and steel,  coal and electricalindustries  is likely to be considerably larger.  Very large quantitiesof cast iron (estimated by some witnesses at 500,000 tons) would  berequired for the  lining  of  the tunnels.   In addition,  the largequantities  of railway metals and electrical equipment required wouldalso  give   additional  employment  in   the  industries  concerned.Estimates of the  indirect effect on employment of such a scheme must  necessarily  be  speculative  unless  based  on data gained  inconnection with similar  works.  For this  reason,  we invited theConsulting Engineers to give us their opinion in the light of  their experience.  They consider (Section (1)  (e)) that, during the first(five-year) period   when the pilot and drainage tunnels were under construction additional  employment would  be  indirectly afforded to an average of 750  men per annum.   They calculate that  duringthe subsequent (three-year) period when the main  traffic  tunnelswould be  under  construction  the additional indirect  employment would amount to an average of 4,500 men per annum.   99.  During the  construction  period  existing  services  bothpassenger and goods would be  maintained as at present, and therewould be no falling off of direct employment on account of the tunnel.The position would, of course, be  materially changed as soon  asthe  tunnel  was  actually  opened  for traffic.   It  is  probablethat  the  Ostend  route  would  be   maintained,  but  we  areinformed by the Southern Railway and the Chemin de  Fer du  Nordthat they  would probably close down their present boat services  onthe Dover-Calais and Folkestone-Boulogne routes.   Large reduc-tions  of staff at the Marine stations at Dover and Folkestone wouldresult from a closing of the boat services.   The Exchange  station at  Sandling Junction  would,  however, require  a  fairly  largestaff  and would  absorb a considerable proportion  of the  labourdisplaced  at the  Marine Stations.  The Southern Bailway  havefurnished us with an  estimate  from .which it appears that at Doverthere would probably be  a reduction of 143 in  the  dock staff and87 in the Dover Marine Station  staff;  and  that  at Folkestonereductions on a more or less similar scale might be expected.  the marine staff on the  cross-channel boats at present numbers 763officers and men who would lose their present employment.   Fromthe foregoing figures, it  seems likely  that at the  opening of thetunnel  the Southern   Railway  would   reduce   their   presentstaff by about 1,000 men.  The Folkestone Harbour Board is ownedand operated by  the  Southern Railway and allowance has  beenmade in the foregoing estimates for any reductions that might bemade in its staff.   As regards Dover, the Register of Dover Harbourhas informed us that  it is anticipated that a considerable number ofmen now employed by the Harbour Board would lose their employ-ment on the opening of a Channel Tunnel.   In addition there is&quot;apossibility of further labour being displaced in  the cross-Channel
Short  Sea  Trades,  if  the  fears  expressed  by  the  shipping companies (paragraphs 121-124) prove to be well-founded.                        (b.) Agriculture.   100.  We now turn to  the consideration of the effects that theconstruction of a Tunnel might have  on  British agriculture.  Onthis  question  we have taken  evidence  from  the  Ministry  ofAgriculture  and Fisheries, from the representatives of the fruit and Vegetables Committee, and of the Glasshouse  Growers&apos; Sub-Committee of the National  Farmers&apos; Union, and from the BailwayCompanies.  We deal with this problem  at  some length as thereis  no doubt that in southern and eastern England some sectionsof  the  farming  community  entertain  feelings  of apprehensionregarding the  possible consequences to their  industry.  The viewheld is that  as  the result  of  the improved  transport  facilities offered  by the Tunnel, agricultural imports from the Continentwould increase at the expense of home production.   The pz-oductswhich it is  thought would be most likely to be affected are fluidmilk, cream, fruit, vegetables and flowers.   Comparative nearnessto the market  at  present gives these products a certain competitiveadvantage  over  the foreign producer.   It  is  feared  that  thisadvantage would largely disappear if  a Tunnel were constructed,and  that the  home  producer would have to  face the competition of foreign producers whose costs of production were lower than hisown.   101.  From a marketing point of view, the question is primarilyone  of the extent to which the construction of a Channel tunnel would  increase  foreign  competition by reducing the cost,  or by increasing  the efficiency, of the transport of  agricultural produce to this  country from the  Continent.   Perishable  goods naturallytend  to travel  by  the speediest  route  or  that  involving leasthandling.  It is,  therefore, not unlikely that other conditions being equal a Channel Tunnel  would exercise a special attraction forthe import  of certain classes of agricultural produce.  Moreover,the existence  of  a Tunnel might stimulate or even in some casescreate a trade in  the kinds of produce  specially  grown  for theEnglish market.  How far the Tunnel would exercise  such aninfluence cannot  be  anticipated with certainty, but in the following paragraphs we examine the various&apos; classes of produce involved and endeavour to  estimate the probable effect in  each case.   As willbe seen by reference to the map (Appendix &quot;VII) furnished to us bythe Ministry of  Agriculture and Fisheries, the bulk of the  agricul-tural produce  imported from the Continent through  the ports likelyto be  affected  by  a Channel  Tunnel does not  come  from theimmediate neighbourhood  of those ports,  but from producing areassituated at a  considerable distance from them.                          (i.)  Cereals.   102.  The traffic in cereals through  the ports likely  to  beaffected by the Tunnel is negligible, and imports into this country are unlikely to be stimulated, in any  way, by its construction.                           (ii.) Meat.   103.  As with cereals,  the bulk of the  meat  supply  of  thiscountry comes from extra-European sources, and  will, no  doubt,continue to do so whether a Channel Tunnel is built  or not.  Atpresent, the import of fresh meat from the-Continent is prohibitedby an embargo  imposed in 1926 as a protection against  foot-andmouth disease.   If  this were,  at  any time, removed, the pork,veal,  and lamb  trade  of Holland and, to  a  less extent,  Belgiumwith  this  country might  revive,  but the centres of  production are, for the  most part,  outside the range  of the Tunnel.   Thereis little  likelihood  of  fresh  sources  of  supply more accessible to the  Tunnel  being developed.   Favourable &quot;through&quot;  ratesmight possibly stimulate veal  production in  the Thierache  region of France, where dairying  is extensively practised,  but, at present,
owing- to  the  virtual  prohibition of  imports  into France,  the domestic demand  in that country for meat  allows  no  margin fora profitable export trade.                          (iii.) Eggs.    104.  The traffic in eggs through the ports of Dover, Folkestoneand Newhaven in 1927 amounted to 60,000 great hundreds, or J of1 per cent,  of the total imports.  It is possible that a Channel Tunnelmight absorb a proportion of the supplies now entering other Englishports, but even if it secured a trade equal in volume to the whole ofthe supplies imported from France, Belgium,  Switzerland and italy in 1927,  the resulting traffic would only represent 11 per cent.&apos;of thetotal  imports.   It is doubtful  whether a  Channel  Tunnel would increase production for export in those countries to any considerable extent.   Existing  means of transport  from the  Continent  to thiscountry are, it is understood, considered by the big importing firms to be  highly efficient.   The saving in time which a Tunnel mighteffect  would be too small to have any appreciable effect.                         (iv.) Poultry.    105.  As regards poultry, the position is  different, as speed in transit and reduction of handling have an important influence on theappearance  and general condition of  the  supplies reaching  themarket.  Supplies from Holland would not be affected by a  Tunnelbecause it would not be able to compete successfully with the existing facilities offered by the  Shipping Companies on the Amsterdam-London  route.   Supplies of  live and  dead poultry from  France,Belgium, Italy and Switzerland in 1927  amounted to  18 per cent, oftotal imports.  The chief exporting areas in France are  the Vendee,the  Bresse area,  east of the River Saone, the Bourbonnais in  CentralFrance, the district around Le Mans (Normandy) and the Gambais-Houdan area to the south-west of Paris.  Supplies from these areas are  mainly exported from Boulogne and Honfleur.   Owing to the corn-petition between the State-owned and the privately-owned railways,much of  the traffic which would naturally go to Honfleur has been diverted  by special rates to Boulogne.  A Channel  Tunnel wouldtake the Boulogne traffic, but not that which at present goes viaHonfleur.  Imports from France are mainly received in the winter months,  75 per  cent, of the total being imported in the month ofDecember.   In Belgium, the main production area is the  districtaround Malines, supplies from which are exported mainly  by  theZeebrugge-Harwich route or via Antwerp or Ostend and London. Itis possible that some supplies from this  source might be diverted toa Tunnel, but neither in France nor in  Belgium are  the productionareas  sufficiently favourably placed for  a  Tunnel to make a great difference to the traffic.   Italian supplies which are now shipped fromBoulogne or Calais would, however, probably go by the Tunnel route.For these supplies, the elimination of transhipment and the utilisation-tion of refrigerated &apos;&apos; through&apos;&apos;  cars would probably ensure bettercondition and better prices in this country.   Hungarian  supplies which are shipped from Antwerp, Zeebrugge  or  Ostend might alsobe diverted to the Tunnel.   During the summer months, however,supplies of English poultry on the markets are  large and there is little demand for imports.  At present imported poultry  represents25 per cent, of total supplies.                      (v.)  Dairy Produce..    106.  The present traffic in dairy produce between the areas onthe  Continent within the probable range of a  Channel  Tunnel andthis country forms a negligible proportion- of  the  total imports intothe  United Kingdom.   Moreover, as far  as  cheese is  concerned,the  kinds produced  on the Continent  are, in  the  main,  specialvarieties  which are not  directly  competitive  with those produced in this country.  Exports of butter and cheese from Holland wouldprobably  not be affected by the Tunnel.   In  France,  the chiefproducing area for butter is Lower Normandy, but exports from this area are sent via Cherbourg and would probably not be affected.
   107.  Apart  from a few  more or less  experimental shipments from Holland and Denmark in recent years, the fluid milk market inthis country is, at present, unaffected by imported supplies.  leaving aside  the question of rates,  the sea passage and  the handlinginvolved under  present  conditions  of  transport  are  certainly a deterrent to potential exporting  countries.   The  establishment of;&apos; through &apos;&apos; transport of milk in bulk in specially constructed tanksbetween  surplus producing  areas on the Continent  and the  con-suming markets in this country would,  however, probably promote the growth of this traffic.  Holland is, at present, the nearest potentialities-tial source of supply.  It has a large, highly developed dairy industry with  a large export  trade  in  dairy  products.   The  industry,particularly  in Friesland, is  centred  at factories which would  not require extensive adaptation to enable them to undertake the ship-ment  of milk.  It is possible that the price levels  for milk in thiscountry and in  Holland might,  in the summer  months,  allow asmall  margin  for the profitable export of  milk to this country pro-vided  costs of transport were no higher than at present.  As regardsFrance, it  is  unlikely that an  export  trade  in fresh milk would develop to any  extent,  unless  the Tunnel route were markedlycheaper than the present services, as it would hardly  pay producers in this district to undertake the costs and risks of export.   108.  Of the imports of other  kinds of milk products,  onlyfresh  cream is likely to be affected by a  Channel Tunnel.  In  1927,imports of cream from all  sources  amounted to  rather less than125,000 cwt., which  probably  represented  less than one  third ofthe total supplies in Great Britain.   Nearly  75  per cent, of  theimports were,  however, from the Irish Free State and 15 per cent.from Denmark.  The trade of these countries would certainly not beaffected by  the  construction of  a  Channel Tunnel.   The greaterpart of the  remaining 10 per cent, came from Holland, although4,601 cwt.  was received from Switzerland.  Supplies from  France,amounting to only 295 cwt. were  negligible.  Since the enforcement of the Preservatives Order in 1928, imports of cream proper from foreign  countries  have  been  considerably  reduced,  althoughincreasing  supplies have  arrived in  this country in the  form of&quot;artificial&quot; (reconstituted) and  tinned cream. Further,  with thedevelopment of  the trade in reconstituted cream  for use in hotel sand by confectioners, the demand for long-distance  natural creamfor this purpose has diminished.   109.  As regards natural cream  for household use, proximity to the market is,  if anything, more important than  for fluid milkowing to the greater  delay which is usually experienced in passingit  into consumption.  As with fluid milk, the rapid perishability ofcream restricts the area from which  supplies can be drawn.   It istherefore not  likely that the construction  of  a Tunnel would  have any appreciable effect on British production of this commodity.                           (vi.)  Fruit.  -    110.  Imports of fruit from the Continent of the kinds competi-tive with those grown in this country consist chiefly of apples, pears,cherries, plums, strawberries and currants.   In  1927, imports ofapples  from  France, Belgium,  Switzerland and Italy  togetheramounted to only 4 per cent, of total imports. These supplies are mainly of low-grade  fruit, chiefly cider apples, and  in  the case ofFrench supplies, are mainly exported from Cherbourg and Honfleur.A Channel Tunnel would not be likely to affect the position, since thesupplies are not highly perishable and are not generally of a qualityto bear high transport costs.  Imports of pears from  the Continent,especially from  Belgium, and France, form a somewhat larger  pro-portion of total imports.  A proportion of the supplies  received from france and Belgium are of high quality, but  the chief producingareas are outside the effective range of the Tunnel route. The totalimports of pears into Dover, Folkestone and Newhaven in 1927 were less than 5 per cent, of the total imports.   Imports of cherries andplums are mainly derived from France, Belgium and Italy, but thebulk  of total supplies are home grown.  The chief producing area in France is the Rhone valley and this region would benefit from the
Tunnel facilities.   Supplies from Italy and, to some extent, Belgiummight also be diverted from the Harwich-Zeebrugge  ferry to the-Tunnel.   The rapid perishability of  these fruits and their suscep-tibility to damage in  handling would probably render the Tunnelroute attractive to Continental senders.  Some increase  in the traffic is not unlikely from areas readily accessible to the Tunnel.   It is,however, important to note that cherries and plums arrive  in  thiscountry from France before the English season starts and compete with those produced at home only for a short period during the over-lapping period.  Moreover, in the last few seasons, imports of cherriesfrom France have been largely prohibited from mid-June onwards- on account of cherry-fly.   Imports of strawberries into this country ,come almost exclusively from Holland and France.  In France, thechief producing area is in Britanny,  and exports mainly proceed tothis country via Plougastel and Plymouth.   Neither this area northat of Holland would  be affected by a Tunnel.  The principal tomatoexporting countries the Canary Islands, the Channel Islands  andthe  Netherlands are quite outside&apos; the  range  of  the Tunnel.Imports  from Spain  are also  unlikely to  be  affected.   Frenchsupplies grown mainly in Lower Normandy,  and amounting to  lessthan 2 per cent, of the total supplies available in this  country, areexported chiefly from St. Malo and would not proceed by the Channelroute.  Small supplies are  received from Belgium.   Supplies from spain, Italy and France mainly enter this country during the off-season, and during such season do not compete with the home-grownproduct.   There is,  however,  an overlapping season when bothforeign and home-grown produce is on the market, and during  thisshort but important  time  competition would be increased  to  the detriment of the home producer.  Imports of grapes are principallyreceived  from Spain  and Portugal by  direct sea route-althoughHolland and Belgium  also send considerable quantities.  Apart froma proportion of Belgian supplies, however, these areas of production.would not be affected  by a Tunnel.                        (vii.) Vegetables.   111.  As regards potatoes, only the early kinds grown in  Spain-would travel by the Channel route, as after the first ten days  of the season,  when it is profitable to send Spanish early potatoes by the-fast goods train across France to Boulogne,  these supplies are sent by direct boat from Barcelona.    The Channel  Tunnel would not increase the competition of  imports of  potatoes  on  the  Englishmarket  because home-grown supplies are not available until later inthe  season.   Imports of  onions  from  the  Continent  would  beunaffected by the Tunnel.   112.  Of  other kinds of  vegetables,  those  exported  between january and June would be mainly affected  by the Tunnel.   WhenEnglish supplies appear  on the  market in large quantities it doesnot generally pay  to send vegetables to this country.  Apart fromthe Dutch  supplies, which would  not,  in  any case, go  via theTunnel, the bulk  of the imports of early  vegetables come  from france  and, to a  less degree, Belgium, Spain and Algeria.   not all the exporting areas would, however, be affected by the  Tunnel.The  Boscoff and   St. Malo  and  Barfleur  broccoli  exports, forinstance, would be  unaffected, as also would cabbage exports fromCherbourg  and the exports of peas from Plougastel,  which  takes place in May.  It is  also unlikely  that a Tunnel  would stimulategreater  exports  of lettuce  from  Belgium.   The  Tunnel  wouldprobably benefit exporters of  early vegetables from Barcelona, as this produce, at present,  travels overland  via  Cerbere to Boulogne.In Prance, the Perpignan  area (on the  Gulf of  L3&apos;ons)  whichexports  lettuce,  radishes,  &amp;c, chiefly  in  December-April,  theCavaillon  district  (in  the Rhone  valley),  whence  asparagus is..consigned  in March-May,  the early  spring vegetable traffic  fromthe Nantes  area,  the  area around Paris which exports primeurs.to the London market  via Dieppe and Newhaven, the  small radishexporting area round Boulogne might benefit to some extent by theconstruction  of   a  Channel  Tunnel.   In   Belgium  the  small quantities   of  chicory  grown around Brussels and  Ghent and,
-exported to  this country  via  Antwerp and  Harwich  might  alsobenefit from the facilities afforded by the Channel Tunnel.  Withproduce of relatively high value in proportion to its bulk and very rapid perishability, such as early vegetables, speed in transit  andthe minimum amount of handling are of  greater importance thanthe actual cost  of  transportation.  To the extent that a  ChannelTunnel would enable this  produce to reach the  market  in  thiscountry quicker and in better  condition than at present,  it woiddprobably  tend to increase  imports.                         (viii.) Flowers.    118.   In recent years, fairly substantial imports of fresh flowershave been received from the Continent, the two chief sources beingHolland  (for tulips, &amp;c),  and  the  French Eiviera  (for  roses,carnations,  narcissus and mimosa).  A Channel Tunnel would  notbe  likely  to  affect  the  former,  but it  might stimulate the latter.At  present,  the French flower  traffic travels  by special  expressservice to Boulogne.  The trade, is, however, only profitable in theearly months of the year before English produce enters the market,and is necessarily relatively small.                            .P  -                        (ix.) Conclusions.    114.   It will be seen from the foregoing survey that many kinds of  agricultural  produce would be little  if at all  affected by  theconstruction of a Channel Tunnel.  In this class fall cereals, meat,eggs, poultry and most forms of  dairy produce.   As regards cream,we do not  consider that there  are  any reasonable grounds for believing that the home trade is  likely  to be materially  affected.As regards fluid milk, we are advised that unless the rates charged for the Tunnel route  were markedly lower than those at presentin  force, it would  hardly  be profitable  for foreign producers to export to this  country, in view of the  capital expenditure  thatwould  be  involved, the cost  of longer  transport  and the smalldifferences  between the wholesale price  of milk in  this  countryand on the Continent.    115.   As regards fruit and vegetables, also, a large part of theimports  into this country do not  compete directly  with home production.  This  is due in some cases  to a difference in qualitybetween the home-grown produce  and that imported from abroad.In other cases it  is caused by  the imported produce  coming onthe market at. a season when  the home-grown  produce  is not  and could not be available.  There  are, however,  a number of cases in  which imports do compete  directly with home-grown fruit  and vegetables.   In some  instances  the  area of production is so farremoved from the Channel ports that the construction of a tunnel would not alter the existing routes and  would  therefore have no effect one way or the  other on home production.   There remainthose classes of fruit and  vegetables which  are or can be grownmore  cheaply  abroad  in regions that would  be  benefited  by  aChannel  Tunnel.  Of  these the principal are grapes,  cucumbers and flowers.   In  England these are all grown,  for commercial purposes,  under  glass.  It is  estimated that  capital  amounting to upwards  of   10,000,000  to  12,000,000  has  been  invested in  the  glass-house  industry.    The   annual   value   of   the crops  produced  is  stated  to  be   5,000,000.   This  industry witnessed a considerable  expansion  in  the  immediate  post-war years;    but   more  recently  it  has   encountered  difficultieswhich have lead to a contraction of  the area  under glass.   The foreign  producer already enjoys the advantage of a more equableclimate  and lower labour and maintenance costs; and it  has  been represented to us that the construction of a Channel Tunnel would accentuate  these  advantages,  and to that extent worsen  the  com-petitive  power of the British producer.  Witnesses  appeared before us who claimed that the opening in 1924  of the Harwich-Zeebrugge train ferry had in fact produced on a smaller scale effects identical which they  predicted as likely to follow the opening of the Channel Tunnel.  This contention is not, however, borne out by the traffic
figures for that  route furnished to us by the London and  North-Eastern Railway which show that the imports of fruit and vegetablesby ferry from Zeebrugge amounted in 1924 to 22,885  tons, in 1925to 7,008 tons and in 1928 to 19,900 tons.   It is true that thesefigures  include  fruit and  vegetables not  grown  under  glass  aswell as those so grown and that if it were possible to separate  theformer,  the figures  might be somewhat different.  The  industry has no doubt had substantial difficulties  to face in the period underreview.  Part of the explanation of these  difficulties should,  however,in our view be sought elsewhere.  The existing arrangements for thecollection and transport to market of the produce  of the glass-houseindustry appears to us  to  leave  much to be  desired.   We  are&apos;informed  that the machinery  for  the collection of produce at  thenurseries  is inadequate; and  that though special trains  are nowrun  from  some  large  producing  areas  to London,   the   full advantage from  lower rates for bulking is not at present obtained by producers.  At present rates the cost of road transport  is only very slightly above  that of transport by rail.   We believe that a thorough  examination of existing  methods  of marketing  fruit and vegetables would be advantageous both to the growers and to  therailway  companies.   Improvement  of  these  methods would,   webelieve,  enable the growers to bring their produce to market more cheaply,  more rapidly  and in better  condition than is  possibleto-day and would secure for the  railways  a larger and moreprofitable  traffic.    116.   To sum up, we think it probable that, for the special classesof fruit  and vegetables referred to  above, the opening of a ChannelTunnel  would be followed by some increase of foreign competition.Closer proximity to their market should,  however, continue to enablethe British producer to bring his crop to London more rapidly andin better condition than is possible for his foreign rival.    For  thereasons  explained in the preceding paragraph, these natural advan-tages could, we believe, be increased by more  effective co-operationbetween the producers and the railways.                    (o.)  Industry and Trade.    117.   In the hope of obtaining the views of the trading commir-nity, we invited the assistance of the Association of British chambers of Commerce,  which,  at  our request, communicated a number of questions on the subject to its constituent Chambers of Commercethroughout the country.  From the replies received it appears thaton the general question, with the exception of the Birmingham,.Bradford  and Dover Chambers of Commerce, the Chambers favour the construction of a Channel Tunnel, provided that a satisfactoryfinancial scheme can be evolved and that its construction would notadversely affect the trade of the country.   The Chambers are doubf-ful whether a Tunnel  would confer any substantial benefit on theexport trade.   They consider that any  advantage derivable fromthe  construction  of  a  Tunnel would  be  enjoyed by  foreign competitors of  this country  and would prove  a  further handicap tothe  British trader  in  maintaining his hold on  the home  market.They add, however, that a Tunnel  would probably increase  the passenger traffic between  England and the Continent, but that asregards goods  traffic the advantage  would lie  with the  importerof foreign  goods rather than with the British manufacturer.   118.   Of the Chambers opposed to the construction of a tunnel,.Birmingham  and Bradford base their  objections on the ground thatthe export trade would  not benefit, but that imports would increase,with results disadvantageous to British traders.  In addition,  theBradford Chamber express the view that the  facilities offered by a tunnel would be of no advantage to the North of England, as existingroutes  for  goods would still be quicker.    The  Dover Chamber is opposed to the scheme on the ground of the injury which it would do to local interests.   The London Chamber replied that they were     [20352]                                            a\
mot opposed to the scheme provided that no part of its cost formed a  charge on  the  national  revenue.   They considered,  however,that its  economic effects, especially  in relation to through freight rates from the Continent should be closely examined.  The GlasgowChamber favour a tunnel provided it was constructed on economiclines and not at the public  cost,  as they consider that it would do much to encourage passenger traffic between the Continent and thiscountry  and vice versa.  As  regards  goods, they do not think  itwould Sssist the heavy trades between Glasgow and  the  Continent,but they believe it might be of advantage to traders in the midlands and  the  South of England.   The Manchester Chamber support theproposal on  the  general  principle that  any extension  of efficientfacilities for transport and  communication must of  necessity leadto extended trade.  They add that as freight transportation wouldT)e definitely quicker the existence of a tunnel would, in their view,make possible  trade which  is never even contemplated  to-day.   119.   We have found great difficulty in obtaining  expressions-of   opinion   from   representative    bodies   of  manufacturers.Such expressions of opinion as we have received are, for the mostpart, either adverse or indifferent to the idea of  a tunnel.   The LaceFinishing Association express the view that the export trade wouldnot  benefit as a result of  the construction of  a tunnel, but that imports would increase with disadvantageous results to their industry.The Nottingham Chamber of Commerce, which we consulted at thesame time are, however, in favour of a tunnel.  The Silk Associa-tion  of Great  Britain and Ireland express similar fears to those  ofthe  Lace  Finishing  Association, as  they  believe  that  a tunnel would  not benefit the silk  industry.   In reply to an inquiry, theCoventry Chamber of Commerce stated  that  they  had  consulteda leading representative firm of that industry in that city, who had replied that, in their view,  the construction of  a tunnel would notinjure  or benefit their  business  in any way,  and  that  they were therefore unable to express themselves for or against the proposal.The  British Pottery Manufacturers&apos; Association  also stated that theyhad  no observations to offer  on the matter.  The foregoing examples.show the indecisive result of this part of our inquiry.                         (d.) Shipping.    120.   The Chamber  of  Shipping of the United  Kingdom,  in response to an invitation to give evidence before us, replied that shipping as a whole Would  not be  affected  by the construction ofa Channel Tunnel.  They nominated,  however,  witnesses to give evidence on its effect on the regular shipping lines established inthe short sea trades,  which they  anticipated  would be adversely affected.  The conveyance  of passengers by these  shipping  eom-panies  is negligible,  so that the  important consideration is thecompetition for cargo.     121.   Of the two companies regarding which particulars were put before us, it appears that the  vessels likely to be affected byTunnel competition number thirty-six,  that the average numberof voyages of these vessels is 1,950 per annum, and that the cargocarried annually  amounts  in  the  aggregate  to 1,820,000  tons.&apos;The number  of seamen employed on  these  vessels  was given as900.   Shore  labour (mostly in  regular, as  distinct  from casual,-employment)  on wharves,  quays and  docks,  railway  sidings and road transport was put at  1,000,  and clerical labour at  400.   if to  these  figures are  added the  men  employed in  warehousing, which  is a more usual feature of the  short sea trades than  of modern oversea trade, it is probable that the total number of men-employed is not  far short of 2,000.    122.  The shipping companies on behalf of which  evidence was  given are engaged in running  fast,  regular  and  frequent cargo  services  between  London  and  Amsterdam,  Antwerp, Boulogne,  Bordeaux,  Bremen,  the  Charente,  Dunkirk, Ghent, Hamburg,  Havre, Ostend  and -Rotterdam.  We doubt whether  all
 these  services would be affected by  competition from  the Tunnel,-as- it may be assumed, for example, that traffic  now going from Dresden  via,  Hamburg would  not  be attracted to  Calais.  On  the other hand, we were informed that a considerable volume of traffic at present goes from Milan and Switzerland via Hamburg, which could be sent with advantage via Calais if  the Tunnel were in existence.  It was stated that 10 per cent, of one shipping company&apos;s  inward cargo  from a near  French port was of Italian origin.   We were, moreover, impressed by the  variety of  traffics and  of routes now converging on the nearer continental  ports, even from comparatively -distant countries such as Poland  and Spain, much of  which,  we think,  might be  diverted   to  the  Tunnel.   A Tuhnel  would facilitate the  through routing of exports  from this  country to  all parts  of  Europe.   The rail  haul  by the  Tunnel would in many cases  be shorter than by the present routes.  In others it would probably  not be  so much  longer  as   to counter-balance other -advantages offered by the Tunnel.    123.   We do not doubt  that  a  Channel Tunnel  would be a serious competitor to the shipping companies engaged in the short sea trades,  particularly those running  services   with the  nearer continental  ports.   A Tunnel would be able to  offer more rapid and more frequent services and,  in addition,  there  would be one less handling on the Tunnel route.  A Tunnel would thus enjoy the advantage  now held -by the  shipping  companies, which in normal  circumstances have one  less handling than railways.  It is, however,  in regard to rates that the greatest  danger to the companies engaged in the short sea trades  is to  be apprehended. It is  no doubt true  that  sea transport is in  general  cheaper than other forms  of  transport.   We were informed  that even on the cross-Channel  services  where  the  railways undertake  sea carriage, the rate charged by  the railways is normally higher than that  charged by the shipping companies.   Even if this  were ro continue to  be  the case,  it  does  not,  however,  necessarily mean that  a trader would have to  pay  more for transit by the  Tunnel route  than by the  sea  route.  It  is probable that a large  part of the goods traffic obtained by a Channel  Tunnel  would  be  carried on through rates.   To a certain extent  this practice obtains to-day in regard to traffics carried by railway  steamers and train  ferries. The  shipping companies  expressed apprehension  regarding  its -extension, as they claim  that under this system  the  rate charged for the sea portion of the transit is  cut so low as, from  their point -of view,  to be uneconomic.    .124.   In  the Section  dealing  with goods traffic  (paragraph  95) we have expressed the view that the  railways would have every inducement  to quote very low rates  for  export traffic by the Tunnel route in order,  on their return journey,  to fill trucks  which  had entered  this  country with imports  and which otherwise would be returned empty.   This would confer  substantial  benefits  upon British   manufacturers.   Provided  they  were   not  offset by  a corresponding increase  in tariff barriers abroad,  such rates might to some  extent  counteract  any  adverse  trade  balance that  the Tunnel  might  have a tendency  to  create.   The  quotation  of nominal  rates  on  return   trucks  woiild  adversely  affect   the outward  carryings   of  the  short  sea  trades.   In   the  case of one of the principal companies exports amount to 80 per cent. of the  total cargo carried.   We  think  that the  Tunnel might enable the railways to  capture  a  large part of this traffic  without difficulty.  As regards  the remainder,  approximately  two-thirds of their  trade,  which would be left to the  shipping  companies,  the rough cargo would no doubt continue to  go  by sea, but perishable and  finer classes of goods  at present shipped  from  the  nearer Channel ports would probably be sent  by the Tunnel route.  The shipping companies,  however,  depend   on  the more  valuable classes  of goods, which pay  higher  rates, to balance the low rates -on rough cargo.  The evidence placed before us  shows that nearly one-third of the inward traffic, and  nearly one-quarter of the total traffic,  inward  and  outward, carried  by  the shipping lines,  is carried at the higher rates.   If,  therefore,  this  traffic,  or a large part  of  it,  were  lost,  they   would  be  left  with  only  an
unremunerative fraction of their trade.  There would no doubt be some diversion to a Channel Tunnel from the shipping companies of goods at present shipped to and from the more distant Continentalports;  but experience  alone will  show to what extent this  wouldtake place.  As regards the nearer Continental ports, it is probablethat a large part of  the  traffic at present carried by the shipping companies would  be  secured  by  a Tunnel.   In  general,  theshipping companies took the view that the question whether theChannel Tunnel  scheme is to go forward should be determined on  considerations  of  the  national  interest,  but   that,  as  itwould  benefit the railways with  which they compete, adequate safeguards should be  provided to  protect their. interests.   It  isnot possible for us to anticipate the nature of  those safeguards,but it  may be that a solution would be found in the extension  ofthe arrangements which  we understand have been adopted  in thepast in rush  seasons, whereby traffic  is allocated by agreementbetween the railways and the shipping companies.                        (e.)  Railways.                  (i.)  The Southern Railway.   125.  We turn  now  to  the effect  which  a Channel tunnel would  have  on  railway undertakings  in this  country.   TheCompany  most  affected is  the  Southern Eailway,  the  active co-operation of which  would be essential to the  Tunnel  scheme.It has been represented to  us on behalf  of the Company and isno doubt the case that the building of a Channel Tunnel has notat the  present time the same financial attractions to the  SouthernEailway Company as it  had to their  predecessors, the  London,Chatham  and  Dover  and  South-Eastern Railway Companies,when the evidence was given on behalf of those Companies beforethe Select Committee in  1888.  This is,  no doubt,  due in part tothe fact that both the Havre and Dieppe routes were at that timein direct  competition  with the  routes  provided  by the  South-Eastern and London,  Chatham and Dover Companies,  and thatthose Companies expected to attract the  bulk of this traffic to theTunnel route.  To-day,  however,  owing to the amalgamation ofthe  railways, this  competition  no longer exists  so far as  theEnglish railways  are  concerned.  The  general attitude  of  theCompany, as disclosed in the evidence laid before  us, is one ofcaution,  though  we  were   assured  that,  if  it  were ultimatelydecided to  proceed with  the Tunnel scheme, the Company  would do all in their power to ensure its success.  We have already dealtwith the views of the  Company regarding  the cost of the scheme(paragraph  61)  and  the probable volume  of passenger  traffic(paragraph 68) and goods traffic  (paragraph 95).  As regards thecost,  the estimate of the Company is substantially the same asthat prepared for us by the  Consulting Engineers.  As regardsthe  passenger  traffic,  the  Company&apos;s  estimate of  its  probablevolume is less than that  which we ourselves have prepared.  Thisis due to their assuming  a lower rate of progression for the  periodthat must  elapse  before a Tunnel could  be  opened,  a smalleramount of diversion from  other routes and a  smaller amount ofnew traffic especially attracted  to the Tunnel  route on account ofthe  facilities offered.   Their estimate of probable goods traffic isalso,   we  think,   likely  to be  exceeded.   We  have  explained(paragraph 46) that the present proposals contemplate an arrange-ment between the Southern Railway, the Chemin de Fer du Nordand the British and French Channel Tunnel  Companies  whereby the  first two named  companies would operate  and maintain theTunnel.  From the financial point  of view, the attractions  of theTunnel to the Southern Bailway must largely depend on the terms ofthat agreement.  We understand that no agreement has at presentbeen  negotiated,  and we  are therefore  not  in  a  position tooffer  any  observations  on  this  aspect of  the   question.   TheSouthern Bailway have informed us that, in the event of a ChannelTunnel being constructed,  they would propose to discontinue thepresent passenger boat services on the Dover-Calais and Folkestone
-Boulogne routes, and possibly to curtail or discontinue  services on certain other routes.  In that event, the Company would clearly have to take into account the possible loss on the capital invested in the boats operating on these services  and also  the loss of theprofits now earned by these services.  In 1928, this profit amountedto  487,000.   There was also  a profit of  about   60,000  onthe Newhaven-Dieppe service during  last year.   The Companyanticipate that  this  latter figure  would be reduced owing to the transference of some  of  the  passengers  from  that route  to theChannel  Tunnel.    The  Company also  draw   attention   to  thecapital, estimated  roughly at   1,500,000, which they have spenton  the  marine  stations at  Dover   and  Folkestone and  the approaches  thereto,  which would,  to a large extent, be renderedunproductive  if  a   Channel  Tunnel  were  constructed.    TheSouthern  Railway  Company  guarantee  interest at the  rate of8f per cent, on  1,000,000 of Redeemable Debenture Stock raisedby the Dover Harbour Board to meet the cost of harbour improve-ments.  The interest on this amount is at present entirely coveredby  a  poll  tax on  passengers  embarking  and disembarking atDover.*  If a Channel Tunnel  were built, this  source of  revenue would disappear, and  the Railway Company would  be called uponto meet their  liability under  this guarantee.  In  addition to theforegoing, there is the capital expenditure which they would haveto incur to  accommodate their system to the  use  of a  ChannelTunnel.   The nature of  this expenditure, which  the Company esti-mate  at approximately  8,000,000, is discussed  in paragraph 50 ofour Report.    126.   To sum up  the views of the Company on this aspect ofthe   question,   a   direct   loss   is   anticipated,  immediately upon the  opening of the Tunnel, of about  500,000 per annum, towhich must be added the interest charges on, say,   3,000,000 ofnew  capital  which the Company  consider  will  require  to be expended on  consequential works.    The  question whether, inthese circumstances, a Channel Tunnel would be advantageous tothe Southern Railway depends partly on  the success of the Tunneland partly on  the  terms which  the  Southern  Railway,   in  con-junction with the Ghemin de Fer du  Nord,  are  able to make withthe British and French  Channel  Tunnel Companies.          (ii.) The  London and North-Eastern Railway.   127.   The other British railway company  that  might be con-siderably  affected by  the  construction of a  Channel Tunnel  is theLondon and North-Eastern Railway.  The witness who appeared before us on behalf of the Company expressed the view that theopening of a Channel Tunnel  would have  the effect of divertingto the Tunnel  route  a large volume of traffic at present passingby other  routes in addition to that passing by  the Dover-Calaisor Folkestone-Boulogne routes.  This is a question of  time, fareand  convenience.   The diversion to the  Tunnel  route  due  solely to the  acceleration of the  service would be small &quot;apart  fromthat  caused  by  the  provision  of  additional  through  trains.Convenience would, however, be an important factor in divertingtraffic  from existing routes.    It may  be assumed  that  nightexpresses would be  a  feature  of the  services  by  a  ChannelTunnel,  and that these would provide  sleeping accommodation ofthe  best  and most up-to-date  description  suited for all classes of passengers.    These would enable  passengers  to leave London  fornight transit to Continental destinations without the necessity ofany transfer en route, and would thus deprive the long  sea routes,   *NOTE. The  fare charged for the Cross-Channel  journey includes a sum to cover poll  taxes imposed as a contribution towards  the maintenance of theBritish and French ports used for the boat service.   These poll taxos would presumably no longer bo payable, and the future disposal of the portion of thefare  at present reserved for their payment would be a matter for negotiation between the Southern Railway, the Chemin de Fer du Nord and the ChannelTunnel Companies.
such as those via Harwich, of an advantage which they at presentpossess  over the short  sea  routes  which,  from their nature,  areinconvenient for a night service.  In  the opinion of  the Company,development of this kind would have more effect on the diversion oftraffic than  any mere reduction in time of transit.    128.   On a reasonable  assumption as to the convenience ofthe train service  provided  via the Channel  Tunnel, both  as to -through  facilities,  restaurant  and  sleeping  accommodation,  theCompany anticipate that the diversion from the Harwich route to-the Channel Tunnel route would  be approximately as follows :        Holland       ...       ...      ...    Nil.       Belgium      ...       ...      ...     10 per cent.       Germany, Switzerland, &amp;c.      ...    50 per cent.In round numbers this  diversion  would mean  a loss  to the Port of&quot;Harwich  of  about  70,000  passengers   per annum  (including19,000  through Harwich/Flushing).   The effect of the foregoing.;would  be to divert from the Harwich routes something between20 and 25 per  cent, of  the existing traffic, and the loss in revenue estimated at  180,000 per annum, sea and rail could  not bemade  good  in  normal   conditions  by  saving  in  operating.expenditure.   The   savings  would  probably  be  limited  to  a diminution  in  the number of extra sailings during the height ofthe season.   On account of mails and parcels the. Harwich routesearn a revenue of approximately   90,000 per annum.  This traffic is exceptionally affected by considerations of  speed  and unbrokentransit both  considerations specially favourable to the ChannelTunnel route.  The Company  anticipate that the diversion of mails .and parcels would  amount to at  least 25 per cent. say,  22,500-gross.   Allowing for&quot; a saving in  expenses of handling, the net loss.under  this  head may  be  put  at  20,000  per annum.   Theyestimate the probable loss to the  catering and hotels department ofthe  Bailway  Company  roughly  at  a  net figure  of  5,000  perannum.   As regards  good traffic, the Company anticipate that, sofar as  concerns goods  consigned  to London,  the   Tunnel routewould  divert  large quantities of perishable  goods  from  existingsteamship routes, but it would not,  in their  opinion, be likely to divert  any considerable part of the general merchandise at presentcarried by the  Shipping Companies on the short sea routes.  Theyconsider that in such a contest the balance of advantage would beon  the side of the Shipping Companies, and  support this view by reference to their experience  with  the Harwich  train ferry.   Thelatter,  as far  as goods  are concerned, provides almost the samefacility as a Tunnel,  traffic  passing from the  point of origin to thepoint of destination without any break of bulk.   It has not, however,diverted from  ordinary steamer routes any traffic other than those -special and limited classes  for which through conveyance withouttranshipment is the  prime  consideration.  The Company estimate -that a diversion from  the  Harwich  routes to the extent of about10,000 tons might be  anticipated,  with  an approximate  annual loss, taking both sea and rail conveyance  into account, of  15,000gross, or, say,  10,000 net.   As  regards provincial goods  traffic,i.e.,  that to   and  from stations north of London, they  do notapprehend that any appreciable transfer of business  to the  Tunnelroute  would take place.    129!  Prom the  foregoing estimates  it will  be seen that the -Company estimate the total net  loss to their  undertaking  from diversion of traffic to the Channel Tunnel route at  165,000 per annum, of which approximately   120,000  would fall  upon  the shipping as distinct from the  rail service.  The total profit realised from  the Harwich shipping  services during the year 1928  was.  184,000.  The estimated  diversion, if realised,  would, therefore, wipe  out  approximately two-thirds  of  the  profits  now  realised,. with   a   corresponding   loss  in   respect  of  rail   receipts. Turning to the  question of the  capital expended on the develop- meht  of their  services, the  Company point out that  they  have ordered  three new  steamers  with much  increased passenger- accommodation.   One of   these   is  already   in   the   service,. and the other two will be ready in the  early months of this year...
The  cost of  the  vessels  is  very  heavy  ( 700,000), and theirearning power would obviously be seriously restricted if a ChannelTunnel  should  be constructed  and  should divert  business  asanticipated.    Further,  to  deal   with  the  expansion   of  theCompany&apos;s own Continental traffic, and to afford  accommodation for other steamship  services, an  extension of Parkeston Quay(Harwich), with the provision of additional up-to-date appliances,.is  under immediate  consideration.   A decision   to  construct  aChannel Tunnel would tell very heavily against any proposal for this extension at  Parkeston Quay, and  would certainly  give  to such expenditure  a much more  speculative character.   We understand.that  the Company&apos;s decision in regard to the proposed Parkestonextension is likely to  be deferred until it is known whether or  notthe Channel Tunnel  scheme  is to go forward.   In  general,  weunderstand that the  attitude  to be adopted  towards the ChannelTunnel proposal has  not been the  subject of any  definite  decisionon the  part  of the  Board of  the  London and  North-Eastern.Railway.  Evidently,  this  must depend on the  nature of the pro-posal put forward.  If the  Channel Tunnel is to be constructed asa  commercial proposition,  without financial or  other aid from public  authorities   in  this country  or  in   France,  a competing-railway   would   have   difficulty    in   putting    forward  anyspecial  claims for  consideration  or compensation.   As  a com-competing  concern,  the Railway Company would no doubt be  affordedan opportunity  of presenting  its  case before a  parliamentary committee,  according to the  customary procedure.  The  positionwould  be entirely  altered  if  financial  or  other  substantial assistance was given  by the  English or  French  Government,  orby public authorities  of any  kind.   In  that event,  the Company-consider that they would be entitled to make a claim for reasonablecompensation.    The  London    and  North-Eastern   RailwayCompany (or its predecessor in title) has,  at  its own cost, andwithout Government assistance of any kind, established steamshipservices  for  the benefit of Continental travel;  it has  expended alarge   capital  in  providing  the  necessary  ships  and  berthingaccommodation,  with  the  necessary  cranes,  warehouses  and railway station;- it has provided specially luxurious trains  for  the conveyance  of Continental passengers,  together  with hotels  atParkeston Quay and  Liverpool Street, wholly or largely for theiraccommodation.    It   would,   in   their  view,   be  manifestlyinequitable that  they should  be  deprived  of  two-thirds  of  the narrow profit  which they are at last realising on  this investment by the intervention of a public authority in support of a competing-route,  which  could never  have been  brought into being withoutthat  intervention.(iii.) The London, Midland  and Scottish  Railway and  the  Great                       Western Raihvay.   130.  The London, Midland and  Scottish  Railway Companystate that a Channel Tunnel would adversely affect the  volume of passenger traffic carried on their Tilbury-Dunkirk service.  Theythink that the number  of passengers diverted to the Tunnel routewould be roughly  equivalent  to the difference between the numberof passengers carried at present and 200,000, to which figure theyanticipate the traffic will have grown in 1936.  In other words, a tunnel  would have  the effect of reducing the passenger traffic atthat  date to a figure equal to the present number of passengers.At the  same  time  they  consider that the  increased number ofvisitors  from the  Continent via  the Channel Tunnel would morethan  counterbalance this loss  of  revenue by bringing  aboutincreased passenger  business in other  directions.  With regard to-merchandise carried  at  passenger train rates, practically  the  wholeof this  traffic would be diverted to the  Tunnel route, but here again there  might be increased  business between provincial  townsand the Continent.   131.  The Great Western Railway, whom we also  consulted,replied that they had no special  points  which they desired to bring;to our attention.[20352]ii
                        (f.)  Conclusions.    132.   In the foregoing paragraphs we have described the steps that we  have taken to  ascertain the  views of the various interests that are likely to be affected by  a  Channel  Tunnel.   We haveshown that,  especially  in  the south  and east of  England,  the farming  community are apprehensive of the effect which a tunnel would have  on their industry.   We have  examined the various-classes  of  agricultural  produce that  might  be imported  by aChannel Tunnel, and  our  general conclusion  (paragraph 116) isthat, in  the  case  of special classes (particularly grapes, cucumbersand flowers), there would be some increase  of  foreign competitionon the  opening  of  a  Tunnel.   In our view, however,  closerproximity to their market  should continue to enable the Britishproducer to  bring his crop  to London  more rapidly and  in  bettercondition than is possible for his foreign rival, especially if therewere an improvement  in the existing methods of  marketing  the produce   grown.   The bodies  representing industry  and  tradewhom we have  consulted  have  in  the  main  been reluctant to commit  themselves to any definite view on the effect of a ChannelTunnel.   Subject to  a  reservation  on its possible adverse effect on trade, Chambers of Commerce are, on general grounds, in favour ofits construction, but  manufacturers are apprehensive  that it  mightstimulate the import  of foreign goods to the detriment of their own production.  As regards shipping, the  companies engaged in runningcargo boats  on the cross-Channel  short sea trades  are  alarmed at the prospect of a Channel  Tunnel which, they consider,  would beable, with the aid of through rates,  to secure a large part of theirpresent  business, and would, in any  case, be sure of obtaining a con-siderable part of the  perishable and high-paying traffic.  If it .were decided  to proceed with the  Channel Tunnel scheme, it  would benecessary for careful consideration to be given not only to its effecton these Companies, but to  the danger  that, if they were drivenout of  business, freights  might   tend to  rise.,  owing to  the disappearance of their competition.  Turning to the railways, the Southern  is in  a special  position,  as  its  active  co-operation isessential  to  the Tunnel   scheme.   Such   co-operation  would naturally only be forthcoming if the company considered that theterms they  could obtain from the  Channel Tunnel Company were-sufficiently  attractive.   The London and North-Eastern  Bailway fear that part of their  Continental business  might be diverted  to a Tunnel.  The London, Midland and  Scottish Bailway entertain the same  view as regards  their Tilbury-Dunkirk service, but consider that losses on that account would be more than off-set by general...growth  of traffic  following  on the  opening of a Tunnel.    133.  We have  also examined  the  tunnel scheme  from thepoint  of view of the  amount of employment that it would give and of the amount of labour that it might  displace.   As regards the former,  it appears that the  construction of the British  portion ofi;he pilot tunnel would probably give  direct employment  to an average of 250 men  per annum for five years while  the pilot  tunnel was being built, and that in the following three-year period, when the   main   tunnels  were   under   construction,    approximately 1,550 men would be directly employed.  For the same periods, the -estimated  number  of men  to  whom employment  would  be indirectly afforded  is  estimated at  750  and 4,500  respectively.&apos; As regards the displacement of labour on the opening of a Channel&quot;Tunnel, it is probable that reductions amounting to about 1,000  men would be made  by  the Southern Railway.  In addition,  there are .some 2,000  men engaged in the Short Sea shipping trade, some of whom might also lose their  employment.  It appears,  therefore, that the additional  employment likely to be afforded, directly or indirectly, by the tunnel during construction is not  very large.   No question of  displacement of labour would arise until the Tunnel was actually opened.  When it occurred, it would also  probably  not be very considerable.    * NOTE.-These figures are rather lower  than might have been expected, having regard to the heavy estimated cost of the scheme.  We understand that this is due to the fact that the Estimate prepared by the Consulting Engineers not only provides for the payment of interest during construction, but includes large sums for standing charges, supervision, engineering, and contingencies.
   184.  In  considering the wider  aspects of the problem,  it is-important to  bear in mind  that the Tunnel scheme is essentially aproposal designed to secure a larger passenger movement between this country  and the Continent and  vice versa.  The movement ofmerchandise1  at  present  shipped   to  and  from  the  Continenton the cross-Channel short-sea routes is comparatively unimportantin relation to the  trade of the country  as  a whole,  and  largelyconsists  of perishable  goods  or goods  of  relatively  high value.:In fact,  the  value of goods imported, exported and re-exported inrecent years  by the Dover, Folkestone and  Newhaven routes hasamounted to less  than  3  per cent, of  the  foreign trade  of  thiscountry.  The trades  and industries  upon which  the  advantagesclaimed for a Channel  Tunnel (i.e.,  greater facilities, greater;speed and  the. avoidance of  handling  at  the Channel  ports) would be-likely  to react directly in one  way or  another are  few  andunimportant  in relation to the total  trade of this country if thecharacter of  the  goods shipped  remained  as at  present.   Theadvantages or disadvantages, on the other hand, which  an increaseof passenger  traffic is likely to produce are almost impossible  to traceto any particular industry or locality.  It is not surprising therefore that the representatives of trade and industry of the country  as awhole should be  reluctant  to  express  a view  on the  economic value  of a   Tunnel to  themselves.   But,  even  if the  economicreactions upon  individual  industries   were  more  obvious,  itwould,  in our view,  be hazardous  to  attempt  to determine theeconomic value to this  country of a Channel Tunnel by weighing theadvantages which might accrue  to one set of industries against the disadvantages to others.   It would be extremely difficult to  placerelative  values on the extent to which this or that industry wouldbe affected,  if the assessment was to be made merely in the light of present-day conditions.  But when, as is the ease, these determina-tions have to be made  in regard to conditions not of the present daybut of a period ten years or more distant, the impracticability of sucha line of approach becomes even more evident.  Trade and industryand the  conditions surrounding them,  both in this  country and&quot;abroad,  do not stand  still.  They are subject  to  constant change-and evolution, the trend and result of which at so distant a date-no one will be bold enough to forecast.    135.  In seeking views of representative trades and industries,we did  not  look to find an  answer  to  the  question whether theadvantages or  disadvantages of a Channel Tunnel  are  the  greater..We  hoped rather to ascertain  the  importance,  in relation to thegeneral internal economy  of this country, of the individual trades and industries which,  in the light of present-day conditions, expect to be directly affected by the existence of a Channel Tunnel.  In theresult, it appears that the trades  that may  be adversely affected,though  important in themselves,  are not numerous and represent only a small section  of the trades and  industries of this  countrytaken as a whole.    136.  This part of our inquiry would, however, be incomplete- if we did not seek to  examine the problem before  us from a wider angle.   The history of  the last century  abounds  with  examples of innovations  in methods of transport far more important than those which  would result from  a Channel Tunnel.  We think it fair to- assume that the experience of the past may in such a matter  afford valuable evidence of what  may be expected to happen in the future. Major  improvements  in  transport,  when  first  proposed,   were regarded with deep suspicion and alarming prophecies were made regarding their effect on  established industries.   Taken together, these improvements  have,  during the last  eighty years, revolu- tionised all forms of communication, and the period as a whole was. characterised,  not by losses due to their introduction, but rather by general economic progress unequalled in previous experience.    137.  Great innovations it  is true,  whether in industry or in. methods of  transport,  have not  only  brought development  and increased prosperity, but have also borne heavily on the industries. that they have supplanted.  The period of adjustment has often been painful and  has been accompanied by hardship  for those formerlv engaged in  the methods or processes displaced by progress.  The- question before us  is whether, from the point of view of the country      [20352]                                           H  2
as a whole, the benefits which a Channel Tunnel would bring would more than counter-balance the inevitable  hardships  which in the initial period would follow in its  train.   On  the  whole,  afterweighing all the evidence, we are of the opinion that the advantages that would accrue to this country from a Channel Tunnel would belikely to increase with the  passage of years.  The hardships that itwould cause would,  we believe,  be temporary  in character and relatively slight in extent.  From the evidence  received, there  is-every reason to hope that they would be far less than those which inthe-past have marked the introduction of other material changes inthe economic life of the country.  We conclude therefore on balancethat, if, as we believe, a Channel Tunnel could be built, maintained and operated by private enterprise at a cost which  would  permit  ofthe traffic through it being conveyed at rates no  higher than those at present in force on the short cross-Channel route, its construction,by creating  new  traffic and thus increasing  trade, would  be  of-economic advantage to this country.    138.  We recognise that the Government of any country has thepower to modify or impede the working of trade  routes through its territory by means of fiscal tariffs.  Whether such  action would betaken in the case of the  Channel Tunnel route,  it  is,  of course,impossible to say.  In the foregoing survey of the  economic  effects of a  Channel Tunnel on this  country we have  therefore assumed that no discriminatory tariffs would  be directed against the Tunneland that from this point of view the  conditions  in which it wouldbe operated  would be substantially  the  same as those which nowobtain between  this country and the continent.    139.   It   remains  to  examine   what  the  return  on thecapital  is  likely  to  be.   Taking  the  figures  submitted  tous  by  the  Consulting   Engineers  in   their  estimate of thecost  of constructing,  equipping,  maintaining and operating theChannel Tunnel,  and assuming  that  the rates of  charges for the conveyance of  passengers  and goods would not  exceed  those  atpresent in force, and that the passenger traffic in the first year of its operation would be that estimated by us (paragraph 86), with due allowance for mail and merchandise traffic, our calculations indicatethat the return  on the capital invested, though probably meagre  inthe early years, should increase steadily if as may with some con-fidence be expected the passenger traffic continues  to expand  at thesame average compound rate as that at which it has expanded since1850, viz., 4 per cent, per annum.  In submitting these conclusions,we desire to emphasise, however, that they can only be expected toIOP. realised  if no major physical  difficulties are encountered in the-construction of the Tunnel, and if the estimates submitted to us arenot, for other reasons,  exceeded to any material  extent.   We wish,further, to  emphasise that  the  expenditure  involved  in theexploratory work of driving the pilot and drainage  tunnels must,  of necessity,  be highly speculative.  Whether  the  risks involved art.commensurate  with, or disproportionate to, the  financial rewardlikely to accrue to those embarking on the  enterprise is largely amatter of personal feeling, and  is an aspect of  the problem uponwhich we do not feel called upon to express an opinion.        VIII. MISCELLANEOUS CONSIDERATIONS.     Questions of sovereignty and jurisdiction that would require to     be settled between the British and French Governments.   140.  We assume that if His Majesty&apos;s Government  decide tolift the ban imposed in  1883 on  the  construction of a  ChannelTunnel,  they will  at  once open  conversations  with the FrenchGovernment on the important legal and administrative  questionswhich  would require to be settled  before the British and FrenchChannel Tunnel Companies could start operations.  The procedure which  would probably be found most suitable would be the appoint-ment,  as in 1876, of a joint Anglo-French Commission charged withthe duty of preparing a draft Treaty or Agreement for the considera-tion of the  two Governments (see paragraph 19).
   141.  In the course of our  Inquiry,  our attention  has been drawn, to a  number  of the points on which such agreement wouldbe required.  We have not felt  called  upon  ourselves to consider these questions, which indeed fall outside the  scope of our terms ofreference.   We  think, however,  that it may be convenient at thispoint to indicate briefly the more important.  The first question tobe settled would be  that relating to  sovereignty in  respect  of  the portion of the Tunnel lying outside the three-mile limits of Englandand France  respectively.  We are advised that the subsoil beneaththe sea is a res nullius and is therefore like any other res nulling, orunoccupied territory,  capable of being acquired by effective occupa-tion.   The point in the Tunnel at which  British sovereignty would end and French sovereignty would begin  could therefore  be  settledwithout difficulty by a Treaty between  this  country  and France.The  settlement  of this question would determine at what point inthe Tunnel  the  jurisdiction of  the  British  Government would  end and  that  of the French Government  would begin.   The treaty would, also,  need to  provide measures for determining, as regardsany  given offence alleged to have been  committed in the Tunnel,whether it was committed in the portion under British jurisdictionor in that under French jurisdiction.  Suitable arrangements wouldalso  have to be made by the two Governments for the apprehensionof persons  charged  with having committed offences either in  theTunnel or in trains that had passed through it; for  the attendance of witnesses at  the trial of  such persons and for similar purposes.Arrangements would also be required to define the procedure to befollowed  in  civil actions arising  out of  incidents  occurring in  theTunnel and  also to determine the liability of the operating BailwayCompanies in the case of accidents to passengers, theft of mails orbaggage, &amp;c.  Other administrative matters requiring agreement would be those  relating to the  customs, police and postal services.   142.  Another important series of provisions in any treaty regu-lating a Channel Tunnel would be those  defining the  conditions inwhich the Government of either country would be entitled tempo-rarity  to suspend the use of the Tunnel, the conditions on which compensation would be payable  by a  Government exercising its rightunder this section and the classes of  persons by whom such compen-sation, if any,  might be claimed.   Each Government  would,  nodoubt, desire to ensure that in all circumstances it maintainedeffective control over the part of the Tunnel within its territory,  andit might be  found more satisfactory to embody the provisions to  thisend  in the  proposed Treaty rather  than in  the  concession  to begranted to the Tunnel Company concerned or in the private legisla-tipn  which,  as  in this country, such  a Company  would  have topromote.   143.  Finally, it might be considered  desirable to include in theTreaty provision for the appointment of a joint body nominated bythe two Governments charged with appropriate duties of  inspectionduring the construction of the Tunnel and, possibly, of supervision of its subsequent maintenance.(b.) Cost of measures required for the defence of a Channel Tunnel.    144.   We  are  expressly confined by our terms of reference tothe consideration  of the  economic aspects  of  the  proposals  for aChannel  Tunnel, and we have therefore given no consideration tothe question  of the  defensive  measures that  might be  requiredto protect the British  end of the Tunnel or of the preliminarysteps  that would be necessary to ensure the effective blocking ofthe Tunnel,  should  such  ever  be considered necessary in  thenational  interest.  Equally we are of necessity without information regarding the cost of such measures, as no estimate of any  valuecould  have been furnished to us without the whole question  being reviewed  by  the  competent  authorities  in the light  of existing conditions.    There is, however,  one  point connected  with thisquestion  on which we  think it  proper to  offer our  views.   Thesuggestion was made  to us in  evidence  that,  as  the  militaryliabilities of the country would be increased by the construction ofa  Tunnel, it  would be reasonable for  His Majesty&apos;s Government
to require  the Channel Tunnel  Company to bear,  in whole or inpart, the cost of  such additional defensive  measures as might&apos; be&apos;deemed necessary in connection with  the  Tunnel.  On this wewould  observe that it  would,  in our  view,  be  inequitable  to seek to impose  on a  commercial  concern financial liability for  suchdefensive  measures  as may  be deemed necessary for the pro-tection, not merely or primarily of the  interests of that individualconcern, but of the  general community of which it forms a part.There  is,  we believe, no  precedent for.such a charge,  though inmany  instances  the  construction  of  large  works  by  privateenterprise must in fact have  thrown  added responsibilities  on the defensive forces of the country. (c.)  Miscellaneous questions affecting the finance of the scheme.   145.  In  the course of our  Inquiry  our attention  has been drawn to a number of points regarding the financing of the proposedundertaking  on  which   we   desire  to   offer  the   following;observations :             (i.) Financial Assistance by Government.   146.  Some witnesses referred to the possibility that in  certaincircumstances  the  Government  might be  asked to afford some special  form of  financial  assistance  to  the  scheme,  either  byguarantee or otherwise.  We consider that on economic grounds.generally if a Channel  Tunnel is constructed, the work should becarried  out by  private enterprise and  should not be accorded  anyspecial  financial  assistance by  Government.   On  this point  wewere  much impressed by the  view put before us on behalf of the-London  and North  Eastern Railway  Company (paragraph 129).That  Company (or its  predecessor in  title), has,  at its own cost,.and   without  Government  assistance  of any  kind,  establishedsteamship  services  for  the benefit  of  Continental travel;  it  hasexpended a  large  capital  in  providing  the ships  and berthing-accommodation,  with  the  necessary cranes,  warehouses   and railway  station; it has provided  specially luxurious  trains   forthe conveyance of Continental passengers,  together with hotels atParkeston  Quay and Liverpool Street, wholly  or  largely for theiraccommodation.  The Company consider  that,  if special assistance was  given by  the  Government  to  the Channel  Tunnel  scheme,they  would be  entitled  to  make  a claim  for reasonable  compensa-tion,  as it  would be in their view inequitable that they should be deprived of two-thirds of the narrow profit which they are realising-on this investment by the intervention  of a  public authority insupport of a competing  route.   Other competing concerns have  alsoincurred expenditure in the development of their services without government aid and. would be  similarly  prejudiced  if  any specialfinancial assistance was given to this  scheme.   For these and  also for more general reasons we  are opposed on economic grounds tothe grant of such assistance.   (ii.)  Financial Liaison between  British  and  French  Channel                       Tunnel Companies.    147.  It will be seen  (paragraph 47)  that in  the  form  put before  us  the  scheme  contemplates that the  British and  FrenchChannel Tunnel Companies should each assume complete financial responsibility  for the  construction  of their respective sectors ofthe Tunnel.  At the present stage no other scheme could probably have been put forward. We doubt, however, whether in the eventof permission  being given for the construction  of a Tunnel, either Company  would  in   fact  desire  such   an  arrangement.   The construction of the British and  French sectors of the Tunnel are merely parts  of  a single. operation, and  the success of either Company  is  closely bound up  with  that of   the  other.  If, for example,  one  Company  were forced  by insuperable  obstacles to abandon their undertaking, the whole of the expenditure incurred by  the other  Company  would  become  nugatory.  We  do  not question that it is desirable that the  British  sector should  be-
-constructed under  British direction and the French  sector underFrench direction.  &quot;We are, however, of opinion that some arrange-ment should be made between the two constructing Companies for/sharing  financial  responsibility  for  the   construction  of  theirrespective  sectors.              (iii.) Subscription of Capital required.    148.  It has  been  generally assumed  that  as  regards  the provision of capital, that needed by the British  Channel  Tunnel Company  would be  subscribed  in this  country  and  that  needed by the French  Channel Tunnel Company would be subscribed in France.  On general grounds,  we should  prefer to see the share capital of the British Channel  Tunnel  Company  subscribed  and held  in this country.  In  practice,  a stipulation  of that kind is, however, almost impossible to enforce, and in the special circum- stances of the present scheme we do not consider  that it need beregarded as essential.  We have  shown  (paragraph 142) that for military and other  public  reasons,  the  provision in  the national interest of  effective  safeguards for Government supervision of the British sector of the  Tunnel would be an essential condition to the grant  of  permission  for its construction.  The existence of  such safeguards  would, in our view,  be adequate,  even if  some of the capital stock were owned outside  this country.               (d.) Diseases of animals and plants.    149.  It has been suggested to  us that  if a Channel  Tunnel were  constructed, there would be  an  increased risk of animal  and plant diseases being introduced in this country.  The suggestion is that there would be a greater risk of infection owing to  the running of through  goods waggons than  there is  under the present  system by which  goods are transferred at  the  ports from rail to ship. We  think  that this  danger can easily  be  overestimated, since (see paragraph  51) from  the evidence of the  Bailway  Companies, it appears  that  miscellaneous  goods despatched  by  the  Tunnel route would in any case be transferred4 at  the ports to the  special Tunnel service goods waggons.   The  only  through goods waggons that are likely to be employed are those constructed to serve  the needs  of particular districts in France and elsewhere,  where local goods  traffic for the Tunnel route is  sufficiently  large  to  enable bulk  consignments to  be made.  From this  point of  view  theprincipal change that would be brought about by the  constructionof  a   Tunnel would  be  that certain classes of  goods  hitherto imported  into this  country by ship  would in future be imported by train.   The  nature of  the  administrative  arrangements  for inspection  and  control  would,  no  doubt,  require revision  and perhaps elaboration.   Dangers from this source undoubtedly exist atthe present time, but we  see  little  reason  to believe  that  any increased risk  resulting  from a  Channel Tunnel could  not be adequately dealt with.(e.) Possible Social and Other Indirect Effects of a Channel Tunnel.    150.   Two witnesses appeared  before us who were opposed  tothe construction of a Channel Tunnel  on other than economic  or military grounds.  These witnesses objected to  the scheme on theground that a Tunnel would in fact create a land frontier between this country and  the Continent.   They  felt that  the  fact  thatGreat  Britain was an island had been  of great value in the past.They believed that if it ceased to be an island,  as  it would if a tunnel  were  constructed,  there  was  a   risk  of  undesirablereactions of a social and moral kind.   Such questions are outsideour terms of reference, but we think it proper to place on recordthis brief reference to the views on this  subject placed before us,which  we do not doubt will  be considered at a later date by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.
   IX.-GENERAL SURVEY OP EVIDENCE RECEIVED.   131.  We summarise In the following  paragraphs  the principalpoints that have emerged from the evidence that we have received and our conclusions thereon.CHANNEL FERRIES  AND OTHER  NEW  METHODS  OP      CROSS-CHANNEL  COMMUNICATION  PROPOSED  AS      ALTERNATIVES TO  A CHANNEL TUNNEL.   132.  By our Terms of Reference we are directed to consider notonly proposals for a Channel Tunnel but those for other new meansof cross-Channel communication (paragraphs 27-42).  Of the latter,the only  one  which  in our  view is  practicable  on  financial  andtechnical grounds is that for  a Channel Ferry.    We are, however,satisfied that the Dover-Calais and Folkestone-Boulogne routes areunsuitable for  a passenger ferry service. We base this view mainly on the following considerations:    (i.) For these routes it would  be necessary  to employ boats of          shallow draught and therefore  of relatively small  size.          From the point of view of passengers  who object to a sea          passage in rough weather, such a ferry would offer few, if          any, advantages over the existing Channel boats.   (ii.) The relatively  small size of the ferry boats would make it          necessary to split the trains.   There  would, therefore, be          little or no saving of time in the cross-Channel journey by          train ferry as compared  with the existing services  (para-          graphs 27-37).ALTERNATIVE  PROPOSALS FOR   A CHANNEL TUNNEL.   133.  Of the proposals for a Channel Tunnel, the only one thatmerits serious consideration is that put forward by  the ChannelTunnel Company, the particulars of which have been worked out in collaboration with the Southern Railway and the Chemin  de Fer duNord  (paragraphs 44-48).THE  CHANNEL  TUNNEL COMPANVS . PROPOSALS.   155.  The Channel Tunnel Company propose that the tunnellingto be  undertaken  should consist  of  (a)  two independent traffictunnels, each with a diameter of 18 feet 6 inches, and (b) of a smallerpilot tunnel, having a diameter of 10 feet, for drainage and ventilation-tion purposes.  Under this scheme the whole of the tunnel sectionlinking the Southern Railway and the Chemin de Fer du Nord wouldbe electrically operated, and for  this purpose it would be necessaryto construct  exchange stations  at each end of  the tunnel.  It Isanticipated that the open approaches from the  mouth of the Tunnelto the exchange station  on the English side  (which would be atSandting Junction) would be 3  miles and 20 chains in length  andthat the length of those  on the  French side would be 5 miles  and30 chains (paragraph $6).   The cost of the exchange stations and of any consequential improve-ments that might be required in the existing railway lines to theEnglish and French coasts would be.met by the Southern railway and the Chemin de Fer du Nord  respectively.  The  latter companies would also share the cost of the new steel rolling-stock required.   TheChannel Tunnel Companies would not themselves maintain or operate the tunnel section, but would enter into agreements  for these services to be carried out by the two Railway Companies, who would be  in aposition to do so at a substantially lower cost (paragraph 46).   The foregoing proposals assume that the rolling-stock  using thetunnel will conform to the British loading gauge.  In previous schemesit was believed that the Continental railways would insist on theadoption of their larger loading  gauge.   This would have involved
very  heavy expenditure,  estimated by  the Southern  Bailway  at 10,000,000, in the adaptation  of their system from the coast  toLondon.   There is, however, reason now to believe that the Frenchand other Continental Railways affected would accept rolling-stockbuilt to the British loading gauge and would construct a given numberof such vehicles for use on the Tunnel service.  The total consequen-tial expenditure that would require to be incurred by the southern railway  is  now  estimated  by  that  Company  at  approximately 3,000,000 (paragraphs 48-51).GEOLOGICAL  EVIDENCE AVAILABLE.    133.  The geological data available fall into three classes, namely,that afforded by the beds of chalk showing  on the cliffs on each sideof the Channel, by the corresponding beds disclosed  by  shafts andheadings which have been driven on the English and French coasts,and by the  soundings in the Channel and surface samples obtainedfrom its  bed by the French geologists in 1875 (paragraph 53).    The geological evidence shows clearly that if a tunnel is to be con-structed, it  must be driven on a line below the water-bearing strataof the upper and middle chalk and that equally it must be on someline above the gault, which overlies the lower greensand, which has asmuch, if  not more, water than the upper chalk.  It follows, therefore,that the  only formation in which the construction of a tunnel couldbe attempted with  any hope of  success is the lower chalk (para-graph 53).GEOLOGICAL  FORMATION  SUITABLE FOR A  CHANNEL       TUNNEL.    156.  From the geological point of  view the  practicability  of aChannel  Tunnel depends on the continuity  under the Channel of thelower chalk. The evidence available points generally  to the conclu-sion that this formation  does  extend uninterruptedly  across  theStraits.  There is, however, an undoubted  risk  that fissures or eveninfilled valleys may be encountered (paragraph S3).POSSIBILITY  OF  FISSURES  OR INFILLED  VALLEYS.    137.  If fissures, filled with rough gravel, and therefore affordingfairly  free passage for the sea water,  were met  with, cementationwould probably seal them up, but if close sand were met with, whichyielded large  quantities of water,  the conditions would be  moredifficult,  and the success of the process doubtful.  With the develop-ment of  engineering  resources, fissures, unless of  exceptional size,would not,  in the view of the  Consulting Engineers, present anyinsuperable  difficulty  (paragraph 54).    As regards  the possibility of  meeting an infilled valley chargedwith water at a pressure of, say, 150 lbs. per square inch, the positionwould, in the  opinion of the Consulting Engineers, be very serious,but even in that event they hesitate to say that the project wouldhave to  be  abandoned, as it might be possible to deal  with it  by adopting a shield with an entirely closed face, the excavation beingremoved by powerful water jets and washed through controlled pipesin the bulkhead (paragraph 54).PRELIMINARY    GEOLOGICAL    INVESTIGATIONS    RE-       QUIRED.    138.   The  existing evidence regarding the geological formation ofthe  Channel should  be supplemented  by  samples and  soundingsobtained from the sector about half-way across the Straits from which no samples were obtained in the previous surveys, and by a sufficient number  of samples from other parts of the Straits to  afford a roughcheck of the accuracy of the former surveys.  We understand that,given good weather, the necessary observations, if carried out by oneof His Majesty&apos;s Surveying Ships, could be made in the space of oneor two months (paragraph 56).    Borings  in  the bed of the  Channel  were suggested  by somewitnesses, but such could not, except at enormous expense, be madeat frequent  intervals, and even then there would be no certainty thatfissures or infilled valleys did not exist between them (paragraph 56).
PILOT AND DRAINAGE TUNNELS.   139.   All witnesses agreed that it was essential that a pilot tunnelshould be driven through the whole length of the Straits before any expenditure was incurred on the main traffic tunnels.  The consulting engineers recommend:     (i.)  That there should be a drainage tunnel having an internal         diameter of 7 feet, and that it should slope from the centre         of the Channel down to the coast on each side to permit of         drainage by  gravitation.   (ii.)  That a pilot  tunnel having an internal diameter of about         12 feet  (instead of  10 feet as proposed by the  Channel         Tunnel  Company)  should  be driven substantially along         the line of the proposed  traffic  tunnels;  that,  as the         pilot tunnel  proceeds, advance and radial boreholes should         be driven from it to explore the ground ahead and all round         it in order to  obtain the  fullest information regarding the         ground through which the main tunnels would subsequently         be driven.   (ill.)  That the drainage and  pilot tunnels should  be driven         simultaneously,  but that the former  should  be kept in         advance (paragraph 39).   The  Consulting Engineers  consider that  the pilot  tunnel should become a permanent unit  in the Channel Tunnel system, and shouldnot be enlarged to form one of the  main traffic tunnels.  This tunnel(and  the drainage tunnel) would  be lined throughout, and if con-structed  with the diameter recommended, it would provide sufficientwidth for the temporary railways which would be required during itsconstruction for the disposal of the spoil and subsequently during theconstruction of the main tunnels. It would also allow sufficient spacefor the  pipes  used  for  ventilation  and  other  purposes duringconstruction (paragraph 39).PRACTICABILITY   OF   CONSTRUCTING   A   CHANNEL      TUNNEL.   160.   On the available evidence it appears probable that the lowerchalk extends uninterruptedly across the Straits and that it would bepossible  to construct  a Tunnel.  There must, however, remain an element of doubt regarding the practicability of constructing a Tunneluntil  the proposed Pilot Tunnel is completed.  If that is successful^accomplished in the manner proposed, the  practicability of subse-quently constructing the  traffic  tunnels may be regarded as estab-lished (paragraph 56).THE COST OF CONSTRUCTING A CHANNEL TUNNEL   161.  At our  request,  the  Consulting  Engineers  prepared anindependent estimate  of the cost of constructing a Channel Tunnel.Their estimates are the most detailed that have yet been prepared in connection with this scheme.  They agree very closely with thosesubmitted to us by the Channel Tunnel Company and the southern railway. The cost of constructing pilot and drainage tunnels, whichwould be lined throughout, is estimated by the Consulting Engineersat  3,600,000, spread over a period of 5 years, and that of construct-ing and equipping the two traffic tunnels at  24,850,000, spread overa period  of three years (paragraph 61).   These estimates include the cost of the construction of the works,the disposal of the excavation by specially designed waggons and itsdumping into the sea, and the provision of permanent-way, electrical   &apos;equipment and sub-stations, signalling, &amp;c.  It also includes provisionfor the  payment of  interest during  construction on the capital employed.  It excludes  the cost of  providing the English and Frenchexchange stations, the open approaches from the mouth of the tunnelto the exchange  stations, the electrical locomotives, the necessaryrolling-stock, the electric generating stations and the land required,which will fall to be met respectively by the Southern Railway andthe Chemin de Fer du Nord (paragraph 61).
DISPOSAL OF THE SPOIL.   162  The scheme submitted to us and that recommended by theConsulting Engineers contemplates that the spoil would be disposedof by waggons.  Various witnesses have, however, suggested that bythe addition of water it might be possible to reduce the excavatedmaterial to a slurry capable of being pumped out of the  tunnel.  Theadvantages of this method, which has been worked out in great detail by Monsieur Fougerollea, were strongly urged by the witness of theChemin de Fer du Nord.   A trial of this method could,  we under-stand, be carried out  at a cost of about  40,000 in the heading drivenin under the sea on the French side about the year 1880.  In view ofthe large  economies  that would be effected if the system could be successfully employed, we consider that if permission is given toconstruct  a Channel  Tunnel this suggestion should be carefully con-sidered  before any decision was taken to dispose of the spoil in theordinary way by waggons (paragraph 60).MAINTENANCE OF A CHANNEL TUNNEL.   163.  The Consulting Engineers consider that no difficulty need be apprehended regarding the maintenance of a Channel Tunnel.The  tunnel would be lined  throughout, and  in  sections where theground contained water the joints of the  lining would  be caulked.Such small leakages as would occur could be dealt with by the waterbeing led to the drainage headings for pumping. Similarly, no serious difficulty is anticipated regarding the maintenance of the permanentway.  There is less corrosion of the rails, &amp;c, in a tunnel where the traffic is worked electrically  than in the open.   The inspection and repair of the tracks would have to be carried out mainly at night, andwould  require careful  organisation  for  the transport of  men  and materials.  It is for this service that the pilot tunnel  would be prinoi-pally used after the opening  of the tunnel (paragraph 63).OPERATION OF A CHANNEL TUNNEL.   16$.  As regards  the operation of the railway, electric tractionand automatic signalling would be adopted. The running of the trainsthemselves would, in the view of the Consulting Engineers,  createsufficient ventilation, which could be regulated by openings into the pilot tunnel.  If this proved to be insufficient, it could, they suggest,be supplemented  by  propeller fans,  the pilot tunnel being used to convey air to the running tunnels (paragraph 64).COST OF MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION OF A CHANNEL      TUNNEL.   165.   In view of the considerable divergence of opinion expressedby witnesses, we asked the Consulting Engineers specially to considerthe probable cost of the operation and upkeep of a Channel Tunnel,and  they reported that on the  assumption that the electric  loco-motives and rolling-stock were owned and maintained by the opera-ting  Railway Companies, the expenditure thereon would not reach asum of  500,000 per annum.   This figure includes the cost of theelectricity required to  maintain  a ten-minute service, if  necessary,at certain times of the day, but does not include the cost of construct-ing a generating station on  the English  side, as the consulting engineers assume that by the  date that a Channel Tunnel could be opened the  necessary current  could  be obtained from the national scheme  under the  Central Electricity Board  (the  &quot; Grid &quot;) (para-graph 65).[20352]
PROBABLE  VOLUME  OF  PASSENGER  TRAFFIC AT THE      DATE  OF THE  OPENING  OF  A TUNNEL  AND THE      AMOUNT OF  THAT  TRAFFIC  WHICH  A  TUNNEL      MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO SECURE.           The Channel  Tunnel Company&apos;s  Estimate.   166.  The Channel Tunnel Company consider that 80 per cent, ofthe passenger traffic on the short sea routes would be diverted to aChannel Tunnel and 40 per cent, of  the traffic on the other routes,and that the facilities offered by a Channel Tunnel would raise thenumber of foreigners crossing the Channel to the number of Britishsubjects so doing.  On this basis, they calculate that if a ChannelTunnel was opened in 1936, it might  be expected to secure 3,677,500passengers (paragraph 67).         The Southern Railway  Company&apos;s  Estimate.   167.  The Southern Railway Company assume for the purpose oftheir argument that a Channel Tunnel could be  opened in 1936; thatthe whole of the passengers carried by the short sea routes would be diverted to a Channel Tunnel and that on the other routes the diver-sion would be as follows:                                                  Per cent.      Newhaven-Dieppe        ............    23      Southampton-Havre            ...     .....    30      Dover-Ostend      ...............    10      Tilbury-Dunkirk         ............    32      Harwich-Hook of Holland&quot;      Harwich-Flushing        I      Harwich-Antwerp                         &quot;&apos;    iL      Harwich-Zeebrugge   The  Company further assume that the facilities offered by aChannel Tunnel would attract additional passenger traffic equivalent in volume to 15 per cent, of the number of passengers carried on the short sea routes.   On this  basis and  assuming  that till 1936 the passenger traffic on the short sea routes will increase at the rate of2   per cent,  per  annum simple,  the  Southern  Railway Companyestimate that if a  Channel Tunnel was opened in that year, it mightbe expected to secure 1,524,943 passengers (paragraph 68).            The Chemin de  Fer du Nord&apos;s Estimate.   168.   The Chemin de Fer du Nord state in view of past experiencethey are  satisfied that cross-Channel passenger traffic will continueto increase at the rate of 4 11 per cent, per annum compound until1940, when they  calculate  that  the  number of  cross-Channelpassengers will amount to 3,721,000 per annum.  As  regards diver-sion from existing routes, they make the  following assumptions:                                                  Per cent.      Boulogne-Folkestone &quot;\      Calais-Dover        V        .........     100      Dunkirk-Tilbury    J      Dieppe-Newhaven &quot;1                              ^g      Ostend-Dover     J                               D      Le Havre-Southampton&quot;1  &apos;      Antwerp-Harwich      j      Other routes     ...............      30-33*On these  assumptions they  estimate the passenger traffic likely tobe secured by a Channel Tunnel in 1940 (if first opened in that year)at 3,200,000 (paragraph 72).*Paragraphs 69-71.
Gl                   The  Committee&apos;s Estimate.   169.  In view  of  the divergence  of the opinions summarised above, we  undertook  an independent survey of existing  statistics,from which it appears that the total number of persons crossing theChannel by all routes  may be expected to increase during the period up to the opening of a Channel Tunnel at 4 per cent, per annum com-pound, i.e., at the average compound rate at which it has increased inthe period 1850-1928 (excluding the years 1914-1923).  On  this basis,the total traffic would  amount to 3,352,000 in 1938, which is assumedfor this purpose to be  the year in which the Tunnel would be opened(paragraphs 73-79).   As  regards diversion  of  passenger traffic from other  routes wethink it reasonable to assume that     (a.) All the passenger traffic carried by the nhort sea routes would         be diverted to a Channel  Tunnel;    (b.) As regards the other Southern Railway routes, 75 per cent.         of the through traffic and 15 per cent, of the local traffic         would be so diverted;    (c.) As regards the  London &amp; North  Eastern  Railway  routes         operated  from Harwich, 50  per cmt. of  the through         traffic and 10  per  cent, of the local traffic other  than that         to Holland (from which no diversion is anticipated) would         be so diverted;    (d.) As regards the  London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway Com-         pany&apos;s service from Tilbury to Dunkirk, 32 per cent, of the         traffic would be diverted  (paragraph 81).   Further, it is not unreasonable to expect that the facilities offered by  a Channel Tunnel might be expected to lead to an increase of passenger traffic equivalent  to 20 per cent,  of the  short sea traffic atthat date (pai&apos;agraphs 82-85).   On the  above basis a Channel Tunnel, if opened in 1938, would secure 2,357,000 passengers  in that year (paragraph 86).AIR TRAFFIC.   170.  As regards passenger traffic,  the London-Paris air services are not likely  to be affected adversely by the  advent of  a ChannelTunnel.  These services will no doubt develop considerably  duringthe next ten years, but they are not likely to offer serious competitionto a Channel Tunnel.  As regards the carriage of goods, air services atpresent only compete  with  other forms of transport in special com-modities of high value or those commodities for which rapidity oftransport is sufficiently important to outweigh the higher cost.  Someof the latter traffic  might  be diverted to a Channel Tunnel.  From thepoint of view of the Tunnel, it is not  likely that air competition for goods traffic would prove a serious factor (paragraphs 87-89).GOODS TRAFFIC.   171.  As regards  imports,  a Tunnel would  probably  secure asubstantial traffic  at present rates  in view  of the  greater speed andregularity of its service compared with that of its competitors, thoughbulky and less profitable  traffic would continue to  use  the  sea route.The same  factors would operate  in  the  case of  exports, though perhaps to a less extent owing  to the longer rail-haul in this country.On the Channel routes imports largely exceed exports, and this mightwell prompt the companies  operating the Tunnel to offer speciallyattractive rates to  exporters, more  particularly as they would other-wise have to return trucks empty  to the Continent.   By doing so they would do something to balance their traffic, and would tend tosecure freight  at present carried by shipping companies (paragraphs90-95).EFFECT   OF A   CHANNEL TUNNEL ON  EMPLOYMENT          DURING  AND  AFTER CONSTRUCTION.   172.  The Consulting Engineers estimate that the building of theBritish half of the pilot and  drainage tunnels would give direct employment to an average  of 250 men per annum, spread over aperiod  of five years.  On the completion of  this stage,  they estimate
that for the  remaining (three-year) period, when the main traffictunnels are under construction, direct employment would be givento an average of 1,550 men on the British section of the Tunnel. they further consider that,  during the first (five-year)  period when the pilot and  drainage tunnels were  under  construction,  additional employment would be  indirectly afforded to an average of 750 menper annum, and that during the subsequent  (three-year) period whenthe  main  traffic  tunnels were  under construction  the additionalindirect employment afforded would amount to an average of 4,500men per annum (paragraphs 97-98).   During the construction period existing  services,  both passenger and  goods, would be maintained as at present, and there would beno falling off of direct employment on account of the tunnel.   Onthe  opening  of  the  Tunnel  large  reductions  of  staff  at  the marine  stations  at Dover  and Folkestone  would  result from aclosing of boat  services.   The  Exchange  Station  at  SandlingJunction would,  however, require  a fairly large  staff and  would absorb  a considerable proportion  of the  labour displaced  at  the marine Stations.    The  Southern  Railway estimate that at Doverthere would probably be a reduction  of 143 in the dock staff and 37 inthe Dover  Marine Station staff; and  that at Folkestone reductions on a more or less similar  scale might be expected.  The marine staffon the cross-Channel boats at present numbers 763 officers and men,who would lose their present employment.  The Folkestone HarbourBoard  is owned and operated by the Southern Railway and allowance has been made in the  foregoing  estimates  for such reductions thatmight  be made in its staff.  As regards Dover, the Harbour autho-rities anticipate that a considerable  number of men would lose their employment on the opening of a Channel Tunnel.  In addition thereis a possibility of further  labour being  displaced in the cross-ChannelShort Sea Trades, if the fears expressed by  the Shipping Companiesprove to be well-founded (paragraph 99).EFFECT OF A CHANNEL TUNNEL ON BRITISH AGRICUL-       TURE.   173.  Many agricultural  products,  i.e.,  cereals,  meat, eggs,poultry and most forms  of dairy produce,  would be little if at  allaffected by the construction of a Channel Tunnel. As regards cream,the home trade is not likely to be  materially affected.  Unless therates charged for  the Tunnel  route were markedly lower  thanthose at present in force, it would hardly  be  profitable for  foreignproducers to export fluid  milk to this country, in view of the capitalexpenditure that would be involved, the cost of longer transport andthe small difference between the wholesale price  of milk  in thiscountry and on the Continent (paragraphs 100-109).   As  regards fruit and vegetables,  a  large  part of the imports intothis  country  do not compete directly with home produce.   This isdue  in some  cases to  a  difference  in quality  between home-grownproduce and that imported from abroad.  In other cases it is causedby the imported produce coming on the market at a season when thehome-grown produce is not and could not be available.  There are,however, certain classes of fruit and vegetables which are or can begrown  more cheaply abroad in regions that would be benefited by aChannel Tunnel,  and  which overlap  in  season with  correspondingBritish produce.   Of these, the principal are grapes, cucumbers andflowers.  For these special classes of fruit and vegetables, the openingof a Channel Tunnel would probably be followed by some increase offoreign competition.  Closer  proximity to their market should, how-ever, continue to enable  the British producer to bring his crop toLondon more rapidly and in  better condition than isi possible for hisforeign rival (paragraphs  110-113).INDUSTRY  AND  TRADE.   174.  The bodies representing industry and trade  who have been consulted have in the main been reluctant  to commit themselves toany  definite view on the effect of a Channel Tunnel.   Subject tocertain reservations, Chambers of Commerce are, on general grounds,in favour of  its construction,  but manufacturers are apprehensive that it might stimulate the import of foreign goods to the detriment of their own production (paragraphs 117-119).
63151SHIPPING.    175.  The companies  engaged in running  cargo boats on the cross-Channel short sea trades  are  alarmed at the prospect of  aChannel Tunnel,  which, they consider, would be able,  with the aid of through rates, to secure a large part of their present business, andwould, in any case, be sure of obtaining a considerable part of theperishable and high-paying traffic (paragraphs 120-124).RAILWAYS.   176.  As  regards the railways,  the  Southern  Railway is in  aspecial position, as its  active co-operation is essential to the Tunnelsoheme.  Such co-operation would naturally only be forthcoming  ifthe company considered that the terms  they could obtain from theChannel  Tunnel Company were sufficiently  attractive.  The Londonand North-Eastern Railway fear that part of their  Continental busi-ness might be  diverted to a Tunnel.   The London, Midland and scottish  Railway  entertain the same view as regards their Tilbury-Dunkirk  service, but consider that losses on that account would bemore than off-set by general growth of traffic following on the openingof a Tunnel (paragraphs 125-131).
X.-SUMMARY  OF  PRINCIPAL  CONCLUSIONS.   177.  Our main conclusions on the economic aspectsof the Channel Tunnel Scheme are  set out  in  para-graphs  132 to 139 of our Report,  and we summarisethese and the other main conclusions of our Inquiry asfollows:    1. None  of  the   new  forms   of   cross-Channelcommunication suggested to us  can be regarded as  asatisfactory alternative  to a Channel Tunnel.   2. On the available evidence it appears probable thatthe geological and engineering  difficulties  likely  to be encountered  could be  successfully  overcome.   Theremust, however, remain an element  of doubt regardingthe practicability of constructing  a  tunnel  until  theproposed pilot tunnel, estimated to cost  5,600,000,  hasbeen successfully  driven right across the Channel.   3. If the pilot tunnel is successfully constructed inthe manner proposed, the practicability of subsequentlyconstructing the  traffic tunnels  may  be regarded asestablished.  The cost of the latter tunnels is estimated at about  25,000,000.  There would be no difficulty  about their  operation and upkeep.   4. If a Channel Tunnel is constructed,  we considerthat on economic grounds the work should be carried outby private enterprise and should not be accorded  anyspecial financial assistance by Government.   5. We believe that a Channel Tunnel could be built,maintained and operated by private enterprise at  a  cost which would permit  of the traffic through it  beingconveyed at  rates not higher than  those at present inforce on the short cross-Channel  route.   6. In the light of conclusion 5 above, we believe that,although some interests would  probably  be adversely affected,  the construction  of a Channel  Tunnel,  bycreating new traffic and thus increasing trade, would beof economic advantage to this country.(Signed)E.

                 MINUTE  OF  DISSENT                               by                   LORD  EBBISHAM.   I HAVE signed the Report,  subject to  the  following Minute ofDissent:                       I. Passenger Traffic.   I do not propose to examine in any  detail the complicated figures  reference and tables set out in this section. The fact that it has been possible  t0 relative to arrive  at such diverse estimates of the probable growth of this  f^Report!5traffic  shows clearly the  difficulty of  the  task.  I  content myselfwith expressing my  conviction  that  the  figures  adopted by  my  66atoS89Pl18colleagues are not likely to be reached,  and that the  rates of increasechosen  are not  likely to be attained.  However,  for the  purposeof examining the effect of the Tunnel I will  assume that the Tunnelwill be  such  a success in the volume of traffic, both of  passengers and  goods it will carry,  as to  afford  a reasonable return on  thecapital outlay involved; on any other assumption there can naturally be no  justification for embarking on  such  a  vast  expenditure.   i therefore  propose to deal  with the economic aspects of the problemon  the hypothesis that  the Tunnel  will  fulfil  the  expectationsindicated, as to  passenger traffic in paragraph  86,  and as  to goodsin paragraph 95 of the Report.  Apart from any  general considera-tion as to promotion of flow  of passenger traffic necessarily  resultingto the  benefit of trade as a whole a consideration with which  Ipropose to deal  later in another  connection it  seems  that  thegreater benefit-to be expected is on  the assumption that the wholeof such additional traffic would consist of  foreigners coming  intothis  country  and spending  money here.   In  examining this question it  is  necessary  in  the  first place  paragraph to remember that the figure of 305,000 represents journeys  and  86-not passengers,  therefore the total number of passengers enteringor leaving this  country  as  tourists or otherwise is only approxi-mately  150,000.   At  present, however, three British subjects to  Paragraphone  foreigner cross the  Channel, and it  seems to me unwise to  82-assume that this  proportion would be varied  in  any additionaltraffic  following  on the Construction of a  Tunnel.   There are two reasons for this view :    (1.) It seems reasonably clear that  the  Tunnel would have little  Paragraph          effect  on  the  volume of journeys  taken  for  business          reasons.   (2.) With regard to tourist  traffic,  it is alleged that the effect  Paragraph          of  the Tunnel would  be to stimulate tourist traffic from  86&apos;          the Continent to this country by removing the present          deterrent of the sea crossing.   This must undoubtedly  be the case, but in my view the effect is likely to be most limited.   The sea crossing is  not by any means the only  deterrent;  the  Tunnel itself may prove a deterrent,  astravelling in a Tunnel  deep  under the sea for a distance of 24 mileswith no possibility of intermediate exit  may prove  a  distastefulprospect for a considerable number of persons.  Continental nations have not  the same  travel habit  as ourselves;  and  it was stated tous by a witness  of great  experience in such matters that  English  Paragraphwatering places  do  not offer the same type of amenity  (by reasonof licensing  restrictions, &amp;c.)  as  foreign watering  places,  andwould  therefore  not be  likely to attract any  substantial increaseof continental traffic.   This is a factor which  must be  taken  intoconsideration  in estimating  the  chance   of  creating any   newcontinental tourist traffic.                                   *   Summing up the foregoing,  my conclusion is  that on the whole the effect of the Tunnel may  be  to  stimulate  passenger traffic ;though  the effect of such  stimulus would be slight.                       II.-Goods Traffic.   I agree  with  the statement of questions of fact contained in 9oaJLa^r5apllsthis section, but I cannot accept the conclusions drawn therefrom.     0   It seems to me that the preponderating advantage will lie withthe importer of foreign goods  and it must be remembered that the ratio of imports to exports by the Channel routes is to-day as 2 to 1.Therefore any  advantage  to be gained  by  the  Tunnel  will
Reference   be an  advantage in  favour  of  the foreign  producer.   This viewto relative   was confirmed by an experienced witness who definitely stated thatPfrReport.S  hi  his  opinion  the  circumstances  of  the  trade  between the           Continent and  this country  are  such that a Tunnel must benefit           imports more than exports.              It may  of course  be  the case,  as suggested,  that  the added           facility  will so stimulate  exports by this route as to  restore the           balance of trade,  but if this is  to be the  case then in my view           wholly new markets will have to be  created.              Prom  Table II of Appendix III it will be seen  that the largest           classes  of exports by  the  Channel routes are cotton and  woollen           goods.              With regard to these,  speed, lack of handling and the  other           advantages  of through rail transit would have little effect, and  I           doubt if this class of traffic  would be much attracted unless the rates           offered were made particularly favourable.   If this could be  done,           it may be  that exports would be increased, but  the rates would           have  to be  so cut as  to be  a real assistance  to the exporter and           to enable  him  by lowering  prices  to widen his  market.  How           far this is possible is a matter of speculation; it might well be that           to be effective the cut in rates would have to be so great as to make           the traffic unremunerative to the Tunnel.   Any large increase  in           trade created by such means to the detriment of either  country           could always be countered by the imposition of tariffs which would           negative any advantage gained by  the trades, and by decreasing           the volume of traffic  would also adversely  affect  the revenues  of           the  Tunnel.  The  possibility of  tariffs being  specially   directed           against the Tunnel must therefore always constitute a considerable           element of  risk,  not  only  to the  traders, but to the Tunnel itself           as a commercial enterprise.               I  have thought it right to draw  attention to these points; but           it. must be remembered that the total trade now carried by the           cross-Channel short-sea routes amounts to not more than 8 per cent.           of the total trade of the country, and therefore any advantage  or           disadvantage must, on the basis of existing conditions at all events,           be comparatively slight.  It  is possible, however, that if a Channel           Tunnel was built, this proportion might be considerably increased,           so far as concerns perishable goods.                                   III. Agriculture.Paragraphs     The National Farmers Union have expressed the view  that the100 to 116.   Tunnel would  damage agricultural  interests.  They are  strongly           opposed to the project which  would  in their view intensify  the           competition from abroad  to  which agriculture in  this country  is           exposed.   They state that in their view it  is imperative that the           State  should refrain from  sanctioning  any  further additions  to           the  handicaps imposed upon the  industry.   If  the State  were           deliberately to endorse a project which they believe would lead to           the  intensification of  foreign competition,  definite injury  would           in their opinion inevitably accrue at a time  when no branch  of the            industry  is in  a position to meet such intensified competition.               Apart from  the  foregoing general considerations there are two            matters on which I desire to comment:                1.  The  first of these is  the  question of milk  and  cream dealt            with in paragraphs 107 and 114.  .Paragraphs     Evidence was given to the Committee  that a very substantial107 and 114. milk.producing  area  in Northern France would be brought by the            Tunnel much nearer  to London in point of time than some  of the           areas from which London at present  draws its milk supply; further,            from the evidence, I believe that there would be a possibility  of            drawing a  large supply of milk  and cream from  the  Continent if           a Tunnel was constructed.   The question is  of great importance,  as            from  official statements  it  appears that of the  total  produce  of           farms  in  Great  Britain  in 1927-28,  Milk  and  Dairy  Produce            represented 23-9  per cent,  of the  whole  and  was valued   at             63,700,000.Il&quot;andail6     2&quot; The Beeond Point is  that dealt witn in ttle lafcter Parfc  of    an    &apos;  paragraph  115 and in paragraph  116  of  the Report,  viz.,  the            question  of existing arrangements for  the transport and marketing            of fruit.
   This  question seems  to  me to be only incidental to the main Referenceline  of the  enquiry;  and I personally  should desire  much fuller t0J^^sinformation and explanation than has been afforded before adopting in Report.the views expressed in those paragraphs.                   IV. Industry and  Trade.   The views expressed  by Chambers of Commerce are given in Paragraphs        u  ...                                                   117 and 118.paragraph  117.   I agree with the general conclusion expressed in paragraph 119that  the result of this part of the inquiry is indecisive, but I thinkweight should  be attached to the  striking fact  that  no specificorganisation  of  manufacturers  in  this country  advocates  theTunnel as  being of definite assistance to its own industry.             .                    V. General Conclusions.   There seemed at  first  sight to be a  reasonably strong vrimdfacie case for the Tunnel, but closer acquaintance with the subjecthas led me to the conclusion  that the balance  of  advantage liesagainst rather than in favour of the scheme.   The case for  the  Tunnel rests, as it  seems to me,  mainly on two arguments :    (a.) That it  must  promote  an increase in the general flow  of  Paragraph          passenger and  goods traffic,  with consequent benefit  to  134&apos;          the community.   (b.) That the experience  of the past teaches that,  although the  Paragraphs          transitional  period may be  accompanied by  hardship,  136 and 137 -          in the end, major  improvements  in  transport are  of          economic advantage.   As to the first  claim, I  agree that an increase in the flow  of passenger traffic  may  be expected, though, in my view, as I have attempted  to show,  it  is  doubtful  how far, in  this particularinstance, such an increase is calculated to ensure any considerablebenefit to this country.   Such benefit as  there may be cannot  betraced to any particular locality or trade, nor is it very  apparentwhat  the nature of such benefit may be.   In  short,  this  claim should, I think,  be regarded more as a hope than an expectation.   With regard to  the second head, I doubt if anyone will quarrelwith this as a generalisation,  though there have been exceptionseven to this rule, as,  for instance, in the case of canals.   My own difficulty is to fit it in to the particular circumstancesof the Tunnel scheme, and  to decide how far such a scheme canbe classed with the general innovations  referred to.   .   This proposition is based on the experience of great innovationsof a  general character  (such, for instance,  as the introductionof steam navigation, railways,  or  the internal combustion engine),which  are equally available for all industries in all countries.  TheTunnel would, however, necessarily be largely local in  effect, and could react to the advantage or disadvantage  of  only a small partof the business life of the country.   Further, such innovations have made  possible developments  oftrade  and  manufacture which,  without  them,  would  have  beenundreamed of.   On the other hand, as  regards passenger traffic,the Tunnel is a  mere replacement of existing facilities, which are capable of ready expansion to  meet an increased demand, and arealso capable of ready contraction, if such demand should diminish.    As regards goods,  it is, I think, worth while to  remember that existing  facilities are  both numerous and flexible,  and that  theycan continue to give  adequate  service to  those industries  requiringsuch service.    The Tunnel, on the other hand, would, if a success, undoubtedlyoust most  competing facilities  from the field,  and any  accident  toit or  deliberate  suspension  of its operation, whether  caused  by national emergency or sabotage, would, for a time  at least,  meanpartial withdrawal  of facilities  with  consequent  disorganisation  oftrade  and  expenditure of time  and money in devising  alternativesystems.   In other  words,  the construction of a Tunnel wouldmean  that  all or nearly all  the eggs would be put in one basket.
Referenceto relativeparagraphsin Report.Paragraphs116,123 and124.Paragraphs117 to 119.Paragraphs96 to 99.   I  propose  now  to  summarise  the  arguments  against  thescheme:    (a.) We  are  debarred  by  our  Terms  of  Reference  from          considering  the  military aspects  of the question,  but         unless the strongest  evidence of economic advantage is         forthcoming,  I venture to  think that the decision  of         previous Governments should be maintained.   (b.) Definite  opposition  has been  offered  by the agricultural          and  a portion of the shipping industries.  There can be          no doubt that, in these two  cases, a Tunnel would have          a detrimental effect.   This  result  is important in that          it  shows a  definite  detriment, specifically  traceable to          particular industries.   I  do not accept the view  stated          in paragraph 185  that  the  relative  advantages  and  -          disadvantages of a Channel  Tunnel  cannot  be measured          by the views  adopted in regard to it by specific industries          and  trades.   (c.) I am  satisfied that  some considerable apprehension exists       .   in the business  community regarding the effect of a          Tunnel as favouring imports.  With one exception  no          Chamber has supported the Tunnel scheme save on quite          general grounds,  and no specific or tangible benefit has          been claimed for it.  On the contrary, some Chambers          have expressed definite opposition.   Further,  no trade          has  expressed any active desire for it.   (d.) So far as employment is  concerned,  I  believe  that  the          temporary gain during the period of construction would          be  more  than counteracted  by  the permanent  loss of          employment  which must necessarily follow.  I need  not          repeat the figures already given in  paragraphs 96 to 99          of the Report, but  I do think it worthy of note  that a          number of the men likely  to be  permanently  displaced          are  members of our mercantile marine.  This would, I          think, be a  regrettable result;  and one which is  well          worth while  avoiding.   I have now stated as fairly and clearly as  I can the arguments for and  against the scheme  as  I  understand them.  The result seems to me to be that the advantages claimed are speculative in nature and quite indefinite as to extent.  The disadvantages, on the other hand, though I have no  desire to magnify  them beyond their due proportion,  are  definite and traceable to  ascertainable trades and industries.    There is one further point I wish to add.   In the case of an island people  such as ourselves it is  advisable  to keep  open all possible  channels of  communication.  Further  there are  certain advantages in this quality  of insularity, and to make this country a mere adjunct to the continent might well promote a  feeling of unrest by adding to our anxieties and responsibilities.    This  is a  psychological factor  which,  in  my view, should be borne in  mind as likely,  under  certain  conditions,   to react unfavourably  on the general life and  trade of the nation.     My general conclusion is that even if  a Tunnel could be built, maintained and operated by private enterprise, and if  it could  carry  traffic at competitive rates,  any resultant  advantages  are uncertain  and,  at the best, slight in  extent,  whilst, on the other  hand,  evidence submitted  has shown that there would be a  definite detriment   to   substantial  portions   of   established industries,   such,   for   instance,  as  Shipping  and Agriculture.     After  hearing  all  the evidence and  taking all  the conditions into consideration, I am therefore opposed to the  scheme  on economic  grounds.(Signed)     BBB1SHAM.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,    February 28, 1980.
APPENDIX I.Report  to  the  Channel  Tunnel  Sub-Committee  by    Livesey,  Son and  Henderson, MM.Inst.C.E.,  Mott,    Hay and Anderson, MM.Inst.C.E., Rendel, Palmer    and Tritton, MM.Inst.C.E.To the Chairman and Members of the Channel Tunnel    Sub-Committee, Committee of Civil Research,          2, Whitehall Gardens, London, S.W.I.Gentlemen,                    CHANNEL TUNNEL.   As requested, we have carefully considered the question of theconstruction of the above tunnel. We have examined the plans and sections and studied the evidence  placed at our disposal by  your committee.   Taking the questions put to us  in the order they appear in the&apos;&apos; Terms of Reference,&apos;&apos;  we have the honour to report as follows : 1 (a),  (iandii). &quot;Is a  Channel Tunnel Feasible of Construction,      Maintenance and Operation ? &quot;   In  considering the Feasibility of Construction, we  need hardlysay that this will depend  upon the nature of the ground  to betunnelled through.   It appears to be generally accepted by the geologists who  have studied the scheme that  the beds of chalk showing on the cliffs anddisclosed by shafts on both sides of the Channel (and by the sound-ings  and  surface  samples  across  the  Channel  itself)  do  in all probability extend across the Straits.  The evidence of Sir John Flett,Mr. John Pringle,  M. Javary, and the Official French Report put inby Baron d&apos;Erlanger all point to this conclusion; but  none of the witnesses is able to say  that the tunnel can be driven  (24 miles in length under the  sea)  without  meeting with fissures or infilledvalleys.   The existence of these cannot be said to have been either provedor disproved by the soundings and surface samples referred to above.These samples may have been numerous enough  for the geologiststo determine approximately the outcrops of the various strata, butreliance cannot be placed upon them for more than that.   If large fissures filled with rough gravel and  in direct commu-communication with the  sea were  met with the difficulty of tunnellingthrough them would be very serious, and we are of the  opinion thatthe risk of such a contingency cannot be disregarded.   Compressed-air working could not be resorted  to as  the pressureequivalent to the head of water would be so great that  it  would notbe a practicable proposition.   Freezing the Ground in front of  the face has been suggested; but from all we  know of this process we are doubtful of its success indealing with the difficulty.   There is also the process of Cementation.  This consists of pump-Ing cement grout into the fissures through pipes kept well in advanceof the tunnel. This system has been used though not with uniformsuccess in a great number of different situations, sometimes using
pressures up to as much as 2,000 lbs. per square inch,  if fissures,filled with rough gravel and therefore affording fairly free passagefor the sea water, were met with, our view would be that cementationwould probably seal them up; on the other hand, if close sand were met with, yet yielding large quantities of water, the conditions wouldbe more difficult and the success of the process doubtful.   We feel,  however, that with the  development of engineeringresources, fissures, unless of exceptional size, would not present anyinsuperable difficulty.  On the other hand, if an infilled valley were encountered (so deep that the tunnel would come  out of the chalk)charged with water at a pressure of, say,  150 lbs.  per square inch,the position would be very serious.    We hesitate to say that the project would have to be abandoned, as it might be possible to dealwith it by adopting a shield with an entirely closed  face, such as was designed by the  late Mr. J. H. Greathead; the  excavation beingremoved by powerful water jets and washed through controlled pipesin the bulkhead.  This, however, has never been tried except experi-mentally, and we are not aware of any tunnel which has been drivenunder such conditions as we have outlined above.   As  regards the Maintenance of the Tunnel,  we see no reason toapprehend  any difficulty.   The tunnels would be lined throughout,and  in the sections where the  ground contained water the joints ofthe lining would be caulked.  Small leakages would no doubt occur,and  the water would be led to the drainage headings referred tolater and pumped.   The Maintenance of the Permanent Way would also not  presentany  serious difficulty.  There is less corrosion of the rails, &amp;c, in a tunnel where the traffic is worked electrically than in the open.  the inspection and repair of the tracks would have to be carried outmainlv at  night, and  a  careful  organisation would have to bearranged for. the transport of men and materials.   We see no reason to apprehend difficulty in connection with theOperation of the railway.  Electric traction and automatic signallingwould, of course, be adopted.  The running of the  trains themselves would  probably create enough ventilation, which could be regulated by openings into the pilot tunnel (to which  reference is made later)as found necessary.   If  this were insufficient, it could be  supple-mented by propellor fans, the pilot tunnel being used to convey air to the running tunnels.    During the period of construction the  supply of fresh air to themen at each face would require careful consideration and would bea  matter of considerable expense throughout the operations.    The plan and section  (Drawing No. C.T.1*) accompanying thisreport shows the suggested centre-line of the tunnel and the stratawhich it is expected will be met with on  that line.  Sir John Flettand Mr. Pringle  are of the opinion that the line shown will permit ofthe  construction of the tunnel in the lower chalk,  which it is agreedis the best medium.    We have shown the proposed level of  the tunnel on the  section,but  this can be  varied if found advisable after the driving of the pilot tunnel.(b.)  &quot; Is a Pilot Tunnel Necessary or Advisable, and how long would      it take to construct ? &quot;   We think a Pilot Tunnel is absolutely necessary, and, in addition,we advise that drainage tunnels should be provided.   The Pilot  Tunnel should be driven near  the centre-line  fromshore to shore and  at about  the same, level as  the future maintunnels.   As it proceeded,  advance and radial boreholes should be driven from it to explore the ground ahead and all round it so thatthe fullest information would be obtained regarding the groundthrough which the main tunnels would subsequently be driven.   This information could not be obtained from the drainage tunnelsfor reasons given later.   We think the  pilot tunnel should not be less than about 12 feetinternal diameter, instead of 10 feet suggested by the Promoters andthe Southern  Eailway Company.  A 12-feet tunnel would provide sufficient width for the temporary railways  which  would be required       *  NOTE.-Drawing No. C.T. 1 is reproduced as Appendix IV.
for the construction of both the pilot tunnel and the main tunnelsand space for the pipes used for ventilation and other purposes duringconstruction.   The disposal of the spoil from the main tunnels would be effectedthrough the pilot tunnel.   Junctions would be made to each maintunnel at, say, every two  miles, so that construction could proceedsimultaneously at many points on each half of the Channel. .   The Drainage Tunnels should be made 7 feet internal diameter,with a gradient  falling to the shore shafts, in order that if  waterwere  encountered suddenly,  it  would  flow by gravitation to  thepumps, and so would not impede the escape of the workmen throughthe pilot tunnel.   To obtain this  falling gradient the drainage tunnelsmust of necessity diverge from  the centre-line of the tunnels  owingto the dip in the  chalk, and for this reason could give no informationas to the ground in the neighbourhood of the main tunnels.   If the pilot tunnel were to be used for drainage at the shore ends,pumping would have to be carried out  up a rising gradient severalmiles in length and in a very restricted space.   There would also bea risk of a breakdown of the pumping arrangements and consequentflooding of  the working face.   The drainage tunnels  might possibly merge into the pilot tunnelat about 9 miles from each shore reliance being placed thence-forward upon the pilot tunnel to deal with any water met with.  Theestimate  of  cost, however, provides  for  the drainage  tunnelsthroughout.   Connections would be made at  fairly frequent  intervals betweenthe pilot tunnel and the drainage tunnels.   We estimate  that the  pilot and drainage tunnels could be drivenin about 5 years; rotary excavators being employed in both cases.   We are aware that estimates have  been given for carrying out this work in a shorter period of time, but our experience with many different types of boring  machines over long distances is such thatwe consider it is  unwise to rely upon the work being carried out morespeedily.(b) (i). &quot;Is further  Exploratory  Work  required before beginning      work on the Pilot Tunnel ? &quot;(b) (ii). If so, what further work should be done, how long would it      take, and approximately how much would it cost ? &quot;   We think that the areas over which, apparently, no soundingsand surface samples were taken should be explored in the same way,but not necessarily to the same extent, as the rest of the Channel bedhas been done.   Sir John  Flett  and Mr. Pringle both agree that thisis advisable.   We would not rely on these soundings and samples by themselvesany more than we do on those already taken; but they may discloseuseful information.   It has been ascertained that if this work were carried out by oneof H.M. Surveying Ships  the time occupied would not be more thanone or two months, given fine  weather.    Borings in the Channel have been proposed, and while it wouldbe very  satisfactory  to have confirmation  of  the  opinions  of  thegeologists as to  the thickness of the strata extending from shore toshore, the borings  could  not, in our opinion, give the  information required for the tunnel project.   They could not, except at enormousexpense, be made at frequent intervals, and even then there wouldbe no certainty that fissures or  infilled valleys did not exist betweenthem. (c.)  &quot; If and when a Pilot Tunnel  had been successfully made would      it be possible to estimate for the Main Tunnels1 with reasonable      certainty  as to time, cost, and any unusual difficulties to be      overcome ? &quot;    If the  ground through which  the main tunnels are  to be  con- structed were thoroughly  explored by borings from the  pilot  tunnelas described in  Section 1 (b) of this report, and the ground proved to be satisfactory, the answer to the questions  is in the affirmative.
The main tunnels could be completed and equipped in about 3 years,after the Pilot tunnel had been finished.(d) (i). &quot;The Promoters and the Southern Railway Company Buggest      that  5,000,000* would cover the  cost of constructing a Pilot      Tunnel with a diameter of 10 feet; and  23,000,000 that of two      Traffic Tunnels with a diameter of 18 feet 6 inches of a total      length of 35 milesf  (including 12 miles of Approach Tunnels).         &quot; This estimate does not include provision for the cost of      Constructing the Exchange Stations at each end of the Tunnel      or the cost of the Electric Locomotives.         &quot;Are  you able to say that this  is  a  not unreasonable      estimate? *&apos;   Our estimate of the cost of driving the  pilot  tunnel, 12 feetdiameter,  the drainage  tunnels and their shafts, together withthe  connections   between  the pilot  and  drainage  tunnels  is 5,600,000.   We  estimate that the cost of the whole scheme, including  the pilot  tunnel, the  drainage tunnels, the connections between  the pilot tunnel and the main tunnels,  together with the land tunnelsand  open  approaches  will- amount  to   30,900,000,  of  which amount  450,000 represents the cost of the open approaches on bothsides.   Our estimates provide for disposal of the excavation by specially designed waggons  and  dumping into the sea.   They include  theconstruction  of the works, permanent way,  electrical  equipment,sub-stations, signalling, &amp;c, but do-not include the cost of exchangestations, electric locomotives, electric generating stations, or land.   The equipment would provide  for a 10  minutes service if suchis found necessary  at certain times of the day.   It will be seen from the above figures that we are in substantial agreement with the estimate, of the Promoters and of the southern railway Company.   Drawing C.T. 1 accompanying  this report  shows the connectionto the Southern Railway at Sandling Junction at the point indicatedon the plan furnished to us by Mr.  Ellson, the Chief Engineer of theSouthern Railway  Company.   We have discussed  this part  of  thescheme with Mr. John Pringle and he is of opinion that very greatdifficulty would be experienced in constructing the approach tunnelsas shown  owing  to  the disturbed state  of  the ground west  ofShakespeare Cliff, and he would recommend a deviation which would avoid the disturbed ground.  The consideration of this part  of  the project  would not materially affect  the estimate of cost, and we havenot therefore put forward any alternative connection. (d)  (ii). &quot; The  Chemin de Fer du Nord have informed us that, In      their view, if the Fougerolles&apos;, or some similar, method were      successfully  adopted  for disposing of the excavated material,      the  cost of constructing the  Traffic Tunnels would be reduced      to (say)  18,000,000 and the period of construction to 5 years      from the date on which work was started on them.          &quot;Do you consider this system to be a practical one and      these estimates to be well founded ? &quot;   We regret we are unable to give the  Committee any definiteassistance  as to the Fougerolles&apos; or similar method for the disposalof the spoil.  It is probable that some such method might consider-ably reduce  the cost of  construction, but until trial of it is made under conditions similar to those which would obtain&apos; in the actualconstruction of the tunnel, there  is no real information  available.    It is stated in  the Official  French Report that M.  Fougerolleswould be willing to enter into a contract (under reserve) to constructthe &quot;reconnaissance gallery,&quot; 3 metres in diameter, 48 kilometresin length  (30 miles), in  16 months,  for  the sum of 25,000,000   * At a date subsequent to the  drafting of the terms of reference, theSouthern Rajlway  informed the Channel Tunnel Sub-Committee that theirrevised estimate for the whole Pilot Tunnel was  6,000,000.   f This length should be 36 miles.
 francs.  We are unable to credit this, even on the basis of pre-war costs and pre-war value of the franc.    We  have  had  an  interview   with  the  representatives  of M. Fougerolles, who gave us full information about his proposals, and answers to questions which we put to them.    Briefly,  M. Fougerolles  would employ  a   rotary  tunnelling machine similar in principle to those used on the London under- ground railways, and in the experimental headings driven in the chalk  in the Folkestone cliffs  and  under the sea  at  Shakespeare Cliff.  These  machines  can be made to excavate the ground at such a speed  that difficulty  has hitherto been found  in  disposing of the spoil in the ordinary way.  M. Fougerolles proposes to over- come this difficulty by mixing the debris with water in  such prbpor- tions as would reduce it to a slurry capable of being pumped up on to the bed of the sea.  To do this borings would be made to the sea bed, lined with steel tubes.  Sea water is to  be admitted by these tubes for use in spraying the face  of the  excavation and  in  reducing the debris to the consistency required for pumping.    The scheme has  been worked out in considerable detail, and if it can be shown to be practicable, the saving in cost would be large.    We understand that the shaft for experimental heading driven from the English  shore about the  year 1880 has  been filled  up, but that the shaft and heading on the French side remain as they were except that they are full of water  which has drained in from the sea and from the land.   It has, therefore, occurred to us that the  water  could  be  pumped  out  and  a  thorough   test  of M. Fougerolles&apos; proposals made.    It was represented to us  that M. Fougerolles would  undertake to carry out the work involved in this test for the sum of  40,000, including the  cost of the tunnelling machine, which  could  after- wards  be used  for  driving  the  pilot heading.   This is on  the assumption  that  no  more  difficult  ground  is  encountered than already met with in  the experimental heading on the French side.    In  view  of  the saving which would be made if the  system is successfully  demonstrated, we are of opinion  that the  carrying out of the  trial should receive consideration.   What view the Promoters would take of M. Fougerolles&apos; proposal we are of course unable to say.   As  to the saving  in time which might be  brought about by  the adoption of  the method, we find ourselves  unable to make any statement.   The progress of the work  would be measured under this system (if successful)   not by  the disposal  of the  spoil,  butby the time taken to  erect the lining.  We  think it is  essential that the  tunnels should be lined as  they progress.   We have described  M.  Fougerolles&apos; scheme for  the disposal of the spoil,  but it  should not be assumed that, if  it  is unsuccessful, no other method, except by waggons, is practicable.   If there is found to be no difficulty in reducing the spoil to a  slurry, it might be found  feasible, by the addition of more water  (obtained from  the shore shafts), to make it flow through the drainage tunnel to  theshafts, where pumping would be a comparatively easy matter.(d) (iii).  &quot; The Promoters allow the sum of  1,000,000 per annum      for the Operation and Upkeep of the Tunnel.          &quot;Assuming that the Rolling-Stock and  Electrical  Loco-      motives will be owned and maintained by the Operating Rail-      way Companies, is this sum, in your view, sufficient to cover      all costs under this head ? &quot;   On the  assumption  that   the  electric  locomotives and  the rolling-stock  will  be  owned  and  maintained by  the  operatingRailway  Companies,  we  are  of opinion that  the operation andupkeep of the tunnel will not reach a sum of  500,000 per  annum.(e.)  &quot; How many men per annum would probably be employed  (a)      directly and  (b) indirectly in the construction of the Pilot and      Main Tunnels respectively ? &quot;    [20852]                                              u

It thereforeappears to  be necessary that special passenger stock shall be built forthe Tunnel  Service, of such dimensions that  it will  run on theSouthern Bailway.   This, however, does not mean that such stockwill be to any great extent smaller than the ordinary modern Conti-nental vehicles, as their width need only be 5 inches less than that  ofthe most modern coach run in France,  and the roof will have to belowered  to a slight extent.  The generality of English coaches canbe made,  without great expense,  to  run on the Continental lines should this at  any time be advisable.    With regard to waggon stock, the  same remark applies, namely,that the majority of  Continental stock cannot be run  on british railways.   There   are  a  certain  number  of waggons  on theContinent  which, with a  few  small  alterations, can doubtless bemade available, but  it  will probably  be  necessary  to constructspecial waggons -for the Tunnel Service.  If the goods traffic were small and localized, this  method of dealing with it would  be quitesuitable, and is similar to the method adopted to-day by the GreatEastern Train Ferries.   If  the traffic grows to large  dimensions,and if it were drawn from distant parts of Europe, it would appeardifficult, if not  impossible,  to deal  with  it  by means of specialwaggons;  in which case, transhipment would have to be resorted to.                    CONCLUSIONS.A summary of our conclusions would be as follows : (1.) The Feasibility of Construction of the Tunnel depends upon      the nature of  the  ground to be tunnelled through.   No      definite opinion  can be given  until the ground has been      proved by the construction of the pilot tunnel. Difficulties      would no doubt be encountered, but we hesitate to say that      they would be insurmountable.(2.) There is no difficulty as  to the Maintenance of the tunnel,      the Permanent Way or the Operation  of the railway.(8.) A Pilot Tunnel is necessary to test the ground, and should      be  made large enough to give room for temporary rail-      ways and ventilation pipes; when complete it would be      used for  the evacuation of  the spoil  from the  main      tunnels junctions being  made  at intervals  for&apos; this      purpose.   Permanently it  would be  used  for electric      cables,  &amp;c,  as a  duct for  providing  supplementary      ventilation  if found  necessary,  and,  finally,  as access      for inspection and maintenance of electrical equipment,      permanent  way and  signals.(4.) A  Drainage Heading should be  made  with a  gradient-      falling to the shore shafts; and  connected  to  the  pilot      tunnel as required.(5.) The  Pilot  Tunnel and  the  Drainage Heading  could  be      Driven Simultaneously the latter being kept in advance.      The  time required to  construct these  preliminary  works      would be about 5 years; another 8 years being needed      for the construction and equipment  of the main tunnels.
   (6.)  Our Estimate of the Cost of the Pilot and Drainage Head-         ings would be  5,600,000; and for the Main Tunnels         and  Equipment  (not including  the Exchange Stations,         Electric  Locomotives,  Generating Stations  or  Land)          25,800,000-total  80,900,000.   (7.) We think that M. Eougerolles&apos;  proposal, if  successfully         demonstrated, might result  in considerable saving of         cost, and a trial should receive consideration.   (8.) The sum per annum estimated by the Promoters  for the         operation  and upkeep of the works is, in our opinion,         much more than sufficient.   (9.) It will be seen from the Table given in Section 1  (e) that         until the  Pilot  and  Drainage   Tunnels  are  completed,         employment of a large  number of men should not be         expected.
