D0OUM5HT  IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.7(50).COPY WO.3ICABINET.      Anglo-Russian Commercial Negotiations.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade     The draft temporary commercial agreement,  submitted tous by the Russians, which we have agreed to take as a basis for negotiations included a paragraph to the following effect:-          &quot;Hie Majesty1 s Government, on its part, agrees to     extend to the trade of Great Britain and Northern     Ireland with the U.S.S.R.  all the privileges which are or     may be accorded by them hereafter in the sphere of     export credits and further agrees that in respect of     these and any other similar privileges the said trade     shall be placed on the same footing as the trade of     Great Britain and Northern Ireland with any other foreign     country&quot;.In our counterdraft, this paragraph was omitted and it was explained to the Russian negotiators that it was impossible togive any general undertaking of most-favoured-nation treatment in regard to export credits as  each application for suchcredits was considered on its merits.   It was true that in theTreaty of 1924 His Majesty&apos;s Government had promised toremove the administrative obstacle to  the grant of suchcredits for Anglo-Russian trade.  This obstacle had, however,been removed and there was therefore no occasion to inserta provision of the kind suggested.  Moreover, it was pointedout that export credit facilities were given for the benefit ofBritish exporters and that the  whole matter was therefore entire&quot;one for His Majesty&apos;s Government.     The Russiandelegation, however, expressed  a very  keen anxiety to see some-1-
reference to export credits in the  temporary  agreement  as they feared that in the absence of some  such reference His Majesty1 sGovernment might withdraw Russia from the Export Credits Schemealtogether, or might in effect discriminate against Anglo-Russian trade in this matter.  They were accordingly told that whilst in the circumstances of the  case it was impossible toundertake to guarantee  equality with other countries in thismatter we would consider whether some form of wording might possibly be agreed upon which would secure that the financialCommittee concerned should be empowered whilst the agreement wasin force to consider applications for export credits in respectof trade with Russia.     It was at first thought that an undertaking on the following lines would not embarrass His Majesty1s Government:-          &quot;His Majesty1s Government on its part also agrees that     transactions between traders of the United Kingdom and     U.S.S.R. shall be oligible for consideration by the     Advisory Committee of the Export Credits Guarantee     Department.&quot;     I understand, however, that the Chancellor of the Exchequerfeels unable to agree to any undertaking whatever being givenabout export credits in connection with the temporary trade agreement, but he feels that there i s no  saying what interpreta-tion may be placed hereafter on any undertaking, however innocentit may appear, and that any undertaking would be liable to giverise to  trouble when individual transactions with Russia areruled out by the Advisory Committee on commercial and financial grounds.     The Russian draft agreement, apart from the particular reference to export  credits,  embodied a suggested protocol which,the Russian negotiators explained, was intended to secure thatno legislative or  administrative action  should be taken by either party which would  involve discrimination against
Anglo-Russian trade, the two parties being guided in all such matters by purely economic considerations.  The Russiandraft was, however, very obscurely worded and the Britishnegotiators were Invited to submit an alternative formula whichit was suggested, could be so drafted as to secure that british shipping should not be excluded from the carrying trade betweenthe two countries, or not adequately employed.  The Russiansexplained that they were perfectly ready to agree that in thismatter also economic considerations only should weigh.  In thelight of this discussion a draft of a protocol was prepared inthe Board of Trade and submitted to the other Departmentsconcerned, but not to the Russians.  The draft ran as follows:-          &quot;In concluding the present Agreement the Contracting     Parties are animated by the intention of  eliminating from     their economic  relations so far as possible all  forms of     discrimination.  They  accordingly agree that, In regard     to the purchase and sale of goods, in regard to  the     employment  of  dipping and in regard to  all  similar     matters, they  will be guided  only by commercial  and     financial considerations,  and subject to  such  consideration-     tions, will adopt no legislative or administrative action     of such a nature as to place  the goods, shipping and     trading organisations  of the  other Party  in  a position     of inferiority  as compared with the goods,  shipping or     trading organi sections  of any  other  foreign  country.&quot; I understand that  the Chancellor of the Exchequer would onlybe prepared to agree to a protocol on these  lines If  it woremade absolutely  clear that  it did  not apply  in any  way to export  credits.  This could no  doubt be achieved  by theaddition  of a  final sentence to the protocol  somewhat to thefollowing effect:-  &quot;it is understood that nothing In  thisprotocol  relates to the grant of export  credit facilities by either  Government  in favour of  trade between  the  two  countries
this being a matter in each country of purely domestic concern &quot;...     I feel grave doubt,  however,  whether,  if this line istaken, we shall be able to conclude a temporary tradingagreement at all.  There  are several relatively minor matters in which we and the Russian negotiators do  not see altogethereye to eye, but most of these are  probably  capable of some adjustment in view of the fact that the present agreement isat best intended to be of temporary character and not to bo aTreaty regulating commercial relations for  a long period.  Thereare, however, two matters which the Russians have made it. clearthat they regard as vital to the success of tho agreement.  Thefirst of those concerns the question of the diplomatic status of their trade delegation, its members and  offices.,  Thearticle dealing with this matter is being considered by  aspecial Anglo-Russian Committee on which the British representa-tives are Foreign Office and Home Office officials, and  thereis reason to think that it will be extremely difficult to deviseclauses which will satisfy the Russians whilst giving effect tothe Cabinet decision on the matter.  This,  however, is not primarily my concern.  The second question, namely, thatrelating to export credits, is one to which there is reason tothink that  tho Russian negotiators are likely to attach  almost as great impoz^tance and if they are to be told that no referencewhatever to this matter can be included in the temporaryagreement and that words must be embodied in the generalprotocol making  it abundantly clear that we can give no  under-taking on the  subject there is every probability that  the wholenegotiation will prove abortive.      In these  circumstances I feel it necessary to take  theviews of my colleagues as to whether  I  should inform the RussianAmbassador  at once that it is the  considered decision  of                              -4-
His Majesty1s Government that  no  undertaking of any kindcan be given in regard to export  credit  facilities for AngloRussian trade and that we must Insist on this  being made clear in the agreement.                                         W.O.Board of Trade,    4th March, 1930.
