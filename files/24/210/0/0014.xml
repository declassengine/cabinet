LONDOfl SQUARES  PROTECTION BILL.                   Memorandum by Minister  of Health.              The  one  outstanding  question on the London Squares     Protection  Bill  is -/nether the Grown Squares should be included     in it.              The  First Commissioner of Works  and the  Minister of     Agriculture,  on  behalf of the  Commissioners of Crown Lands,  urge     that  the  Crown Squares should  be excluded, on the  grounds  (1) that     this  is  in  accordance vrith precedent,  and  (2) that these Squares     are already  sufficiently  protected.               Objection was  also originally taken to the Bill  on the     ground  that  it subjected  the  Crown to a local authority.   This     objection has no-,  disappeared  since the Bill as redrawn entirely     exempts  the  Cro&apos;-n Squares from the jurisdiction of the London County     Council  and leaves the ultimate decision  to Parliament.              There  is certainly one precedent (and that a London     precedent)  for the Inclusion of Crown Squares in such a Bill,     viz.   the London Squares and Enclosures (Preservation) Act,  1906,     which included three Crown Squares In the Schedules.   The fact     that  this was an agreed measure in no way weakens  its  cogency as     a precedent.   The objection on the ground of precedent was  not     urged before the Royal Commission  in evidence for  the Crown     departments, who,  in fact, acquiesced In  the  inclusion of the     Grown  Squares in the Bill.   The  Royal Commission proceeded on     the basis that they would be so included  and.  framed  their report     accordingly.   To exclude them would thus be  a material departure     from the report of the Commission.   It -/ould have to  be  defended     either on the ground of precedent  or on the  ground of  adequate                                                             existing/&apos;
existing protection.   The first ground is as already shovminconclusive.   The second ground involves its supporters ina dilemma.   Either the existing legislation affords absoluteprotection to the Crown Squares, in-which case ,the inclusionof the Squares in the 3111 can do no harm and the Crown should(in the words of a member of the Royal Commission) &quot;set a goodexample&apos;1 or it does not afford absolute protection, in which case the inclusion of the Squares in the Bill is necessary.          Moreover, exclusion must leari to similar claims on                                                                  Ibehalf of other classes of Squares, and to the raising of thequestion to what extent does adequate protection already exist.   IThis would involve discussion and argument as to the meaningand effect of many different acts of Parliament, the trueconstruction of rhich is a matter of sufficient difficulty toperplex the Courts of La?/ themselves, as vras clearly shown inthe proceedings as to Edwardes Square, Kensington, some years                                                                 /1ago.   It -fas no doubt in order to avoid the raising of such                                                                 WHquestions that the Royal Commission made their clear andstraightforward proposal to include all Squares within the purview Iof the Bill.   I submit that their view is the right one and thatthe Bill should be framed accordingly, if it is to have any                                                                  1chance of reaching the statute book.   The issue in fact seemsto me to be so important that the question of abandoning the      IBill at once arises if the Crown Squares are excluded.                                           (Intd. ) A.G.Ministry of Health,   Whitehall, S.W.1.25th February, 1930.
