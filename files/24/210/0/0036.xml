THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                    Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1930.SECRET.                                                    Copy No.     ^2CP- 8b (30).                                 CABINET.ACCOMMODATION  IN  THE DOMINIONS  AND  COLONIAL  OFFICES.MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS AND  FOR. THE.                                  COLONIES.    AS the general question of accommodation in Government Offices has been raisedby the First Commissioner of Works in his paper CP. 67 (30) under the heading ofWhitehall Gardens (Montagu House) Site, I feel that it  would be opportune forme now to bring to the notice of my colleagues and I have  the First Commissionersconcurrence in this course the question of  accommodation in the Dominions and colonial Offices;  this matter, which has for some time been engaging consideration,has now become so acute that I  feel it my  duty to record my opinion that  not onlyis the smooth working of the two departments already suffering, but also that their efficiency is in danger of being most seriously affected.    During the war the work of the Colonial Office did not expand at all, but since1919 the expansion  has  been  almost continuous  and,  in  the  aggregate, veryconsiderable.   The acceptance of  Mandates for  the Tanganyika  Territory, the cameroons, &amp;c,  brought additional work  to the Office and necessitated  additional staff; a new Middle East Department has been created to deal with Palestine, Trans-Jordan and Iraq.  Further, the setting up of a separate Dominions Office necessitated the appointment  of separate Parliamentary and Permanent TJnder-Secretaries forDominion Affairs, with  the consequent demand (which is still growing owing to heavy increase of work) for extra accommodation;  and, in addition, various newposts, such as those of Agricultural Adviser and Financial  Adviser to the Secretaryof State for the Colonies have come into being.    The Office of Works have been most helpful in providing temporary makeshiftsto cope with the  situations which have arisen from time to time for these reasons,and various annexes to the main building in  Downing Street  (e.g., at No. 2, RichmondTerrace) have been occupied.  Nevertheless,  the situation remains acute.  The systemof annexes, though affording temporary relief,  is obviously unsatisfactory  in manyways.  It is,  for example,  clearly undesirable  that  an  important member of theColonial Office, such as the newly-appointed Financial Adviser, should not be housedin the same building as the Secretary of State for the Colonies  and the main portionof the Staff of the Colonial Office, yet, in the present year,  it  has been quite impossibleto provide accommodation for Sir John Campbell in the main building.    The  Oversea Settlement Branch of  the   Dominions  Office  has also  to  be accomodated in a separate building some distance away,  and no rooms are availablein the Downing Street building for even the higher officials of this Branch, though they are often needed  for purposes of consultation.  The same applies to the jointAccounts Branch and to  the staff of the  Private  Secretary  for  Appointments(Colonial Office).    The  main building  is  extremely congested.  Every available room has beenbrought into  occupation, even  some which were  formerly used  as  store-rooms,larders, &amp;c. Some of the rooms formerly inhabited by the  Resident Clerks, like thoseformerly  used  in the  Luncheon  Department,  have  been  absorbed  for   office accommodation.  The top storey and the basement are now fully occupied, though inmany cases the rooms are dark, badly warmed and draughty or ill-ventilated, and infact a menace to the health of the occupiers.  No officer under the rank of Assistant      [20747]
Secretary in either the Dominions Office or the Colonial Office can count on having a room to himself;  the Principals sit two or three in a room,  and in one case thereare as many as six officers doing administrative work in one room.  All these officers have, from time to  time, to conduct important and confidential interviews,  and it is often extremely difficult  and embarrassing to attempt  this in  a room with  even one other occupant, not to mention the fact that the constant interruption of telephonesand callers on  other officers  make  concentration  almost impossible  under  suchconditions.  Moreover, the increasing use made of shorthand-writers, which is very desirable from every other point of view, is naturally a source of  annoyance to other officers in the same room.  Some Administrative officers have had to be relegatedto the basement.  There is only one Conference Room for both the Dominions and colonial Offices : a large number of  Committees meet in the main  building and whenthe Conference Room is already occupied by one Committee, it  is often extremelydifficult to find a suitable place for another meeting which may  have to be held atthe same time. There is one small Waiting Room only, and this, a mere makeshift,in an inaccessible position and entirely inadequate.   Callers, who are numerous and often persons of distinction, such as  Governors-General and Governors, have, withfew exceptions,  perforce to wait in the passages.   Moreover, the Colonial Office is often called upon to  provide rooms for Governors and other  high officials on leavefrom the Colonies, who are doing special work on behalf of the Office; it is becoming increasingly^ difficult  to meet these  demands.    Such is the position at present, and it is already sufficiently  acute.  But this isnot all. I contemplate that in the near future it will be absolutely necessary to create a new Personnel Branch of the Colonial Office to deal with all the personal side  of thework, including the steadily increasing number of appointments  and promotions  inthe various Colonial Services.  It  is  true  that a large proportion of  this branchwould consist of officers taken over from other branches, but the position is such that even the smallest expansion of staff would cause great embarrassment from the pointof view of accommodation. There is no need for me to enter here  into the possibilityof the complete separation of the Dominions Office and the  Colonial Office,  but Iwould only say in passing that if a separate Secretary of State for Dominion affairs or Secretary of State for the Colonies were appointed, it would  be a matter of thegreatest difficulty and inconvenience (and then only by extending other officials intoadditional annexes, which would have to be provided) to find suitable accommodation for two Secretaries of  State and their Private Secretaries  in  the existing mainbuilding.    As I have said, the different emergencies have up till now been met as they^ arosewith the assistance of the Office of Works.  But what has been done has admittedlybeen only  temporary makeshift, and cannot be regarded as in any way  satisfactory.as a permanency.                                                                          P.    Dominions Office and Colonial Office,        Downing Street,             March 7, 1930.
