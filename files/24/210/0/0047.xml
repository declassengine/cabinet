HIS DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEBJSttffiMT.ECRET                      CABINET.^7(30).  ---&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;              urlEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.                Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.  1.   In my  Memorandum of 8th March CP.83(30) I pointed out that  owing to the abnormal course which the Live Register has taken this  year, the resources of the Unemployment Fund are nearly exhausted, and  that it will bo necessary to have legislation at once making further  financial provision in order to enable the payment of unemployment  benefit to  be continued.  2,   I have since  discussed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and  the Lord Privy Seal the various alternatives that are open to us, viz:-           (a)  Further borrowing;           (b)  A grant from the Exchequer:           (c)  Further contributions from employers, employed                  and  the Exchequer.  Each of these courses.is open  to grave objection.  3.   In any ordinary  circumstances further borrowing would not be  justified unless we had an assurance that the present drain on the  Fund would  not last.   I am afraid that it cannot be said that there  is any such assurance.   On the contrary it is quite likely that the  rate of expenditure will increase.   Our present revenue will only  pay for something  less than 1,250,000, and the present register  figure is more than 300,000 above that number.   In the absence of an  improvement in the employment  situation further borrowing will only  mean the postponement of a real solution, and there is a danger that  before long we may have to increase the borrowing powers yet again.  4.   As regards an Exchequer grant, I assume this is out of the  question.   The present grants are governed by two intelligible  principles,  viz., equal thirds and relieving the Fund of the cost of  transitional benefit.   There  is no such principle which could be  adopted for a further grant.                                     /5.
                                                                C&apos;. fT\ Z?f                                                                frji if 1/5,   &quot;7ith regard to the third course, namely,  an  increase  ofcontributions from the three contributors to  the  scheme, the history0f the Fund, with borrowing powers rising by  stages  (10 millions,20 millions, 30 millions, 40 millions)  demonstrates  that there is  afrong relation between income and expenditure.   The industrial policy of the Government is based upon  the  need for  getting industryto put its house in order, and  the same principle should be appliedto the Unemployment Fund.   On  the other hand, an increase ofcontributions would be regarded as a  serious  addition to the burdenjn industry and a further impediment  to its recovery, and  would therefore &quot;be open to  the gravest objection  in present circumstances.6,   Obviously, any of the courses open to  us is  full of  the greatest difficulty, and what  we have to do is to make a choice of  evils.After examining the matter in all its bearings, the  Chancellor, theLord Privy Seal and I have been reluctantly driven to the  conclusionthat the only course  we can recommend to the  Cabinet is that ofincreasing the borrowing powers.    Having come to this conclusion,  we have  to consider  to what extent it is necessary to increase the  present limit of  40,000,000. further  10,000,000 would last until  the  beginning of next year ifthe live register averages 1,500,000, while if the average is ,400,000 the money would last  until  the middle of next year.  Should he average be 1,600,000. the  10,000,000 would be exhausted in ovember of this year.   In fixing the  figure we  must bear in mind the necessity for having a sufficient margin  in hand in July to carrysver the summer adjournment of  Parliament-  otherwise we  shall have tohave yet another Bill in July.   If unemployment  is  very high between ovr and July - if for instance  it averages  1,600,000 - the  10,000,000figure would probably not leave enough  margin when the House adjourns. here is, I should add, a greater probabilitv that before  Christmas                                                              /the
 the Fund will need further resources beyond an additional  10,000,000. nevertheless, after considering these points, we are of opinion that  10,000.,000 is the utmost increase in borrowing powers that can be proposed now. 8.   It is necessary also to provide for the repeal of a provision in the existing legislation passed by the previous Government which limits the borrowing powers as from 31st December, 1930 to  30,000,000. 9,   The Bill must be passed before Easter,  I have considered with the Chancellor whether there is any possible way of avoiding this. For example, we considered whether it would be practicable and defensible not to pay the half year&apos;s interest on the present over- draft which falls due at the end of this month, and amounts to between  900,000 and  1,000,000.   There is no doubt, however, in our view, that such a course would be quite indefensible, if not actually illegal. Another possibility which we looked at was to borrow money from the Civil Contingencies Fund.   The legality of this, however, is very doubtful, and in any event the amount available  rould not be anything like sufficient to carry us on for more than an additional two or three weeks.   Our conclusion must be, I fear, that there is no escape from immediate legislation.. 10.  I ask therefore -     (a)  for authority to introduce a Bill which will increase the          Borrowing Powers of the Unemployment Fund to  50,000,000          and repeal the existing provision which reduces the          borrowing powers to  30,000,000 at 31st December, 1930, and     (b)  for arrangements to be made that the Bill shall be passed          into law before Easter.
