   THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAINIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.-.EC5ST -   O.P. 53(30).                CABINET-                COPY HQ.                    Home-Produced Beef for the Forces.         Memorandum by the Minister of- Agriculture and Fisheries.1.      At the meeting on 31st January of the Agricultural. Conference of   representatives of workers, farmers and landownere, which was convened   on the initiative of the Prime minister and personally opened by him a   fortnight earlier, the following resolution was carried unanimously:-        &quot;That this Conference is unanimously of the opinion that, while         it is considering larger and more fundamental issues,         agriculturists throughout the country would welcome as a         sympathetic gesture a decision by the Government to supply H.IJ.         Forces with home-killed beef, at any rate for part of the year,         and flour and bread made from home-grown wheat.&quot;   A similar resolution was passed quite independently by the National   Council of Agriculture for England on 6th February.2.      At the request of the Conference I forwarded this resolution to   the Prime Minister, who has asked me to invite the Cabinet to   reconsider their decision on this subject of July last (Cabinet 27 (29),   Conclusion 9).  At that time the Cabinet feared the proposal might   raise prioes to the public, but from experience in connection with   National Mark beef it appears that there is no ground for serious   apprehension on that score.3.      The principal arguments for and against this proposal are set out   in C.P&apos;s 185,  185, 189 and 190 of 1929.  Since then the agricultural   situation has become worse, owing to a serious decline in the prices   of oorn and potatoes.   We have been able to afford practically no relief   and a sympathetio gesture would be most valuable.4.      Flour can be left out of aooount in view of the reoent decision of   the War Office to use English flour for other than breadmaking wherever   possible.5.      I propose that home-killed fresh beef should be supplied for the   6 months October to March, when supplies -are largest, or,  alternatively,   that we should revert to the pre-war practice of fresh beef for 4 days   per week,  but for 6 months only.  This would reduoe the extra cost from    245,000 to :.2163,000 per annum,
       The objection of the Service Departments was mainly on the ground  of the unfairness of charging the ooet of an agricultural concession  to Service Votes, but it should be possible to devise some means of  overcoming this difficulty.       The National Mark Beef Scheme was introduced in London and  Birmingham in the autumn and is making excellent progress.  Y/hile I do  not contemplate the supply of National Mark beef &quot;except for the London  area and Woolwich, I suggest that beef corresponding to National Mark  grades might perhaps be specified, in order to encourage the idea of  grading and to protect the Service Departments in their buying.  A  further protection could also be provided by requiring that supplies  should bear the stamp ox the Local Sanitary Authority, as provided in  Regulation 15 of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations,  1924.       Sinoe iiagland Is one market with a general prioe level, the  proposal should,  I think, relate to &quot;home-killed&quot; rather than &quot;home-  fed&quot; meat.  The advantage is not removed even if supplies come, in  part,  from Irish animals.       Owing to the considerable inorease in imports of Australian beef  into U.S.A., there is now less reason for opposition from that Dominion,  but in any case home producers have a first olaim in our own markets.       There is probably no single step whioh could be taken by the  Government to aid the farmer, at comparable cost, which would be more  generally appreciated or be of more value.  It would undoubtedly remove  a keen sense of grievance while at the same time giving a valuable lead  to our propaganda for an increased uee of home produoe of all kinds by  the population.  There is an embarrassing inconsistency, which is often  referred to in Parliament and in the Press, in our advooaoy of National  Mai&quot;k beef for the public, while repudiating the principle of the appeal  in supplies obtained by Government Departments.                                                               N.B.inistry of Agriculture and fisheries,       10, Whitehall Place, London,      l.  17th February, 1930.
