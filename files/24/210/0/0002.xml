Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1930.SECRET.                                                     Copy  No.CP.  52 (30).                                 CABINET.CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  THE    COLONIES  AND LORD  OLIVIER REGARDING  LORD  OLIVIER&apos;S    REPORT  UPON SUGAR PRODUCTION  IN  THE  WEST INDIES.        MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    MY colleagues will remember that in accordance with Conclusion 7 (d) reached at the meeting of the Cabinet held on the 12th February,  I undertook  to drawLord  01ivier&apos;s attention to the  impropriety  of  his  making statements  of a controversial character on matters into which  he had been appointed to  enquire,without  his having  awaited  the  submission  of  his  report to  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.    I now circulate a copy of the letter which I addressed to Lord Olivier and, withthe consent of  the Prime Minister, a copy of Lord 01ivier&apos;s reply.    Colonial Office.         Downing Street, February 17, 1930.                   Secretary of State&apos;s Letter to Lord Olivier.(Confidential.)My dear Olivier,                                           February 13,  1930.    WE have now had before us, in Cabinet, your report upon sugar production inthe West  Indies the  first opportunity we had been  afforded  of considering thereport collectively, owing to the delay necessarily  caused by the printing of thereport.    Whilst we  were unable, as was to be expected,  owing to the facts that therewere  other matters to  be  considered  and that the question of  sugar  is  one ofconsiderable complexity and difficulty,  to reach any immediate decisions, the Cabinetdid feel very strongly that  you had caused the Government considerable embarrass-ment  by  trie statement wrrich  you  allowed to be inserted in the West  india committee&apos;s circular, and by your participation in the debate in the House of lords on the following day.  The Prime Minister asked me to convey to you their  regret that you should, by adopting a course which in the circumstances he felt to be undulyprecipitate,  have disclosed  to  the public the gist of your  report  without affordingthe Government  itself, at whose request you  made  the report, any reasonableopportunity of considering either the state of affairs in the West  Indies or thenature of  the recommendations which you put forward  for meeting the situation.    Realising as I do the thoroughness with which  you undertook your investiga-tions  and  the promptness with which you submitted the main body of your report Ihave already written to you to say how much I appreciate this-1 regret to have to write to you in  the sense  of this letter,  but  I feel  sure that  you  yourself will appreciate, upon thinking the matter over,  the reason which led the Prime Ministerto ask me  to write to you on this  matter.                                           Yours very truly,                                                 (Signed)       PASSFIELD.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS GOVERNMENT. &quot; &apos;
                  Lord Olivier&apos;s Reply to the Secretary of State. (Confidential.)                                Oldhall, Ramsden, Charlbury, My dear Passfield,                                         February 14,  1930.     The letter (dated the 13th February) which you have written to me at the Prime Ministers request has greatly astonished me, and I must say at once, with reference to  the last paragraph of it, that, after thinking the matter over, I am unable to recognise any sufficient justification  for the Prime Ministers feeling.     As to the Cabinet, the bearer of evil tidings is always lucky if he escapes the bowstring, and I can well understand that the sudden disclosure to them of the facts of  a grave situation to which it has not been possible for most of them  to pay any previous  attention  may have  produced  a  very  natural  condition  of  humour unfavourable to  a benevolent, or even well-balanced judgment.     That, however, is not my fault,  for my colleague and I cabled a full statement of  the material  facts, with an  urgent appeal for their early consideration, more than six weeks ago.    You inform  me that the Cabinet regretted that I should, by adopting a course which in  the circumstances the Prime Minister felt to be unduly precipitate, have disclosed to the public the gist of our report without  affording the Government itself ......  any reasonable opportunity of considering either the state of affairs in the West Indies  or the nature of the recommendations we put forward for meeting the situation.    As I have observed, the Government had had full information for six weeks past for considering the state of affairs  in the  West Indies.   Nothing is added to  or detracted from that statement by its being now before them in type instead of  in cable-flimsy.    But that point is irrelevant to the complaint made of my action, for I have not criticised  the delay in announcing  a policy, nor indicated nor do I  hold any opinion that that delay has been unreasonable, or  could have, so far, have been avoided.    No embarrassment has  been, or  could have been, caused to the Government  inregard to the measures of policy they may adopt for our recommendations, which are in no wise dogmatic, have not been disclosed or hinted at, nor, so far as I am aware, has anyone but the Cabinet, the Colonial Office and ourselves and Sir E. Stubbs, towhom  I very confidentially disclosed  the text of our telegram  in asking  him  to transmit it any inkling of their character.   They  do not,  in fact, advocate tariff protection (the chief political bone of contention) as  a sound remedy (see  section 47, pp. 20-21, of the printed Report).    As to the facts I have disclosed nothing of the &apos;&apos; gist of our  report&apos;&apos; that hasnot been well-known and obvious to that small section of the public that is conversantwith West Indian and sugar-market  affairs since the Chancellor of the Exchequermade his statement on the 9th July and the League of Nations Economic Committee&apos;sreport was published.  I maintain what I said in the House of Lords to  that effect.I enclose extract  for reference : -         &quot; My Lords,! do not think that the circumstance thatat the present moment    I  am  probably  the best-informed member of your Lordships&apos; House  on this    subject makes it incumbent upon me to be silent and to refrain from supporting    my noble friend on the other side of the House.  My noble friend and I are    familiar with the circumstances  of the West Indies, and they are  to us very    much as Devon and Cornwall are to others.  We have friends there, we have    worked there, we know the interests of the Island intimately, and we perhaps    feel more strongly than some members of your Lordships&apos;  House  the  intense    gravity of the situation now threatening the West Indies, although I am quite    sure that the members of the Government and all members of  the House, if the    facts were within their knowledge, would feel just as strong a sympathy and    just as strong a conviction that  steps must be  taken  to avert the  impending-    calamity.         &quot; There  is nothing whatever  confidential  in the conversations I had with    the Secretary of the West India  Committee which my noble friend just quoted.    There is nothing whatever confidential in any part of our Report.  All that is    in my Report are statements of  fact and findings very carefully  canvassed,    all of  which  have been  publicly  canvassed  and  taken  in evidence  and    discussed by my colleagues and myself  in  the West  Indies.   If  anybody
    were  to  undertake the immense labour of wading through the files  of the    West Indian newspapers  they  would  probably  be  able  to  write as good  a    Report on the subject as my colleague and myself, subject,  of course, to the    minute analysis which we have made with the assistance of our agricultural    adviser, Mr. Jones, a man of great experience in the West Indies, of the factory    work and cultivation work which makes our Report perhaps  a fuller document    on the subject than has yet been published.  In the interview  which I had with    the Secretary of the West India Committee, which the noble Lord has quoted,    I expressed cursorily the opinion that when the Chancellor  of the Exchequer    made the statement which he did in July last he really could not have been fully    acquainted with the facts of the situation.  I say that in no impertinent or    cavilling spirit, but the facts of  the case have been made much more clear since    the Chancellor of  the Exchequer made his announcement.         &quot; Since then there has been published a very important document of the    Economic Committee of the League of Nations which made  a minute analysis    of the world situation and of the causes which  are conducing to the present    difficulties in  the sugar world.  Taking that as our foundation,  my colleague    and myself have written  our  Report, filling up  the lacunae of  that Report with    reference  to the West Indies and taking that as  an authentic document which    may be  held as the governing piece  of evidence in the  situation.  We  have    elaborated that with criticisms  of the  situation in the  various  West Indian    Colonies as the result of  our  investigations of the subject.&quot;These facts are     (1)  that under existing conditions (even with Preference) West  Indian  sugar          can only be  sold at a loss; that these conditions appear  bound to continue          and that the industry cannot continue to be carried on under them;    (2)  that  if  the Preference is withdrawn, without an adequate  succedaneum          adding  3  15s. a  ton  to  the ton, the industry must rapidly be entirely          wound up;    (3)  that the Chancellor of the Exchequers pronouncements  have knocked the          bottom out of the West Indian Sugar market.    This fact  is the most generally realised and keenly felt of the three  (and it surelycreates an urgent situation).    These facts, whether noted in our Report or not, are all of  them public property and unquestioned.   It certainly was not my duty, when Lord Elibank  cited them inthe House of Lords, to abstain from  confirming him.    You and  I and all public-speaking men of our party are well accustomed tocausing annoyance by  the statement of uncomfortable  facts,  but we  have alwaysregarded it as essential for a democracy that facts  should be known as widely andpromptly  as possible.    The decision of policy which the Government  will have to make on the  fact as they exist is  a good deal  more important, and  will involve a greater effort torecommend it  than the uninstructed public has hitherto recognised or than youyourself when  you talked with me last August, or I,  then realised though the west indian and city sugar people were then insistent on them.   The Government willbe the more embarrassed when they come to  announce their  policy,  the more thegeneral public have been left in ignorance  of them.    I do not wish to lengthen  this letter.  Please send a copy of it  to the PrimeMinister and to  the Cabinet.   If  after reading it the Prime Minister  will indicate to me in what manner  / have embarrassed the Government  (he could hardly expect that the Opposition would not seek to make political trouble out of the situation),  Ishall be glad to reconsider my view that his censure  is entirely unjust.   I hope  that,on reconsideration, he himself will withdraw it.    What is embarrassing the Government is the  facts which  are  difficult and -embarrassing the delay  in paying attention  to our  cabled Report and  the pre-judging of the situation in July last on the basis of incomplete information.                                                            I am, &amp;c.                                                   (Signed)      OLIVIER.
