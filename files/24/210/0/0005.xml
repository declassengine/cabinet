fThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;1 SECRET.                                            Copy  No.    ^0Chancellor of the Exchequer.Prime Minister.    IN  accordance with your  instructions given on the 16th December,1929,   the   Memorandum   upon  the   &quot;Economic  Consequences   of disarmament &quot; which  was prepared  in November by a Joint Committeeof the  Parliamentary Labour  Party, the General Council of the TradeUnion  Congress  and the Executive Gommittee of the National LabourParty has been examined  by officials of  the Treasury, Admiralty, lord privy Seal&apos;s  Department,  Board of Trade and Department  of  OverseasTrade,  and the attached Report, which embodies their joint views, is now-submitted for your consideration.    Our conclusions are summarised in Part V of the Report.  They are naturally somewhat detailed, but the gist  of them is that the  very limiteddegree  of disarmament so  far  reached does not justify the proposals forGovernment action made in the memorandum, and  that unemploymentarising from Naval reductions  is only a small part of the general problemof unemployment and should be so dealt  with.    I desire to draw your attention specially to the concrete suggestions in the report for the disposal of Sheerness Dockyard and for the settingup of a Committee to consider whether a scheme for getting rid of oldBritish tonnage is desirable,  and, if so, what form it  should  take.

CABINET.&quot; THE  ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF DISARMAMENT.&quot;Departmental Report on Memorandum by Trade Union Congress General Council.    [CIRCULATED TO THE  CABINET  BY DIRECTION  OF THE  PRIME  MINISTER.]                             I. INTRODUCTORY .    1.   THE  Memorandum*  under review  is dated  the  22nd November,  1929 rthough headed &quot; Trade Union Congress General Council &quot; it is understood to havebeen prepared by a Joint Committee of the Parliamentary  Labour Party, theGeneral Council of the Trades Union Congress and the Executive Committee of theNational Labour Party.  It was submitted to the Prime  Minister  with  a request that he would receive a deputation.  The Prime Minister after  discussion with theChancellor of  the Exchequer asked for  a report  from the Departments  mainly concerned, namely, Treasury, Admiralty, Lord Privy  Seal&apos;s Department,  Board ofTrade, Department  of Overseas Trade and Ministry  of Labour; and the attached report has accordingly been prepared by  the Treasury in  collaboration  with theDepartments named. :                   II. SUMMARY OF T.U.C. MEMORANDUM.    2.   The T.U.C.  Memorandum gives undivided and enthusiastic support  to thepolicy of disarmament; alludes to what has been so far accomplished; and proposesfor the immediate distresses caused therebv  certain measures of alleviation whichare summarised at the end of the memorandum and may be more briefly summarisedhere as follows :     (1.) Preference  under  Colonial Development  Grant procedure  should be given          to districts affected by  disarmament;    (2.) Trade with Russia  should  be stimulated by re-introduction  of  Trade          Facilities;    (3.) Sale of old  British tonnage to foreigners should be prevented;    (4.) Royal dockyards  should be made free to compete  with private  firms for          merchant shipbuilding;    (5.) The Trade  Facilities Act  should be re-introduced;    (6.) Monetary compensation should be paid to workpeople thrown out of work          by disarmament; such compensation to apply to outside firms as well as          to the Government establishments, and to be retrospective.               III. GENERAL COMMENTS ON THE MEMORANDUM.                           (A.) &quot; Disarmament.&quot;    3.   It seems desirable to point out that in speaking of &quot;disarmament&quot; thememorandum is speaking of a difficult ideal which is not yet attained.   Despite theefforts which have been made to reduce it  recently the net expenditure of the three fighting departments is expected to total  110 millions in 1930.  This is  2-1 millionsbelow the figure for 1929 and  10 millions belowT the figure for the peak year 1925,.but only  1 million below the figure for 1923.[20581]* Printed as Appendix to this Report.B
4.   The figures for naval new construction for 1920 onwards are as follows :-19201921192219231924192519261927192819291930Estimated.  millions.     5f     6     3i     6     7     71     &apos; 4     9    10     9f  Actual.  millions.     5*     *i     3i     5i     &apos; 2    104    10     It will be seen that in 1927 expenditure rose to  10^ millions.   This was due tothe 1925 building programme,  and progress on the lines of that programme would normally have meant an expenditure of at least  10- ll millions a year for someyears to come.   The drop since  1927 is due to  curtailment of the programmesubsequent  to  the  Geneva  Conference.   The  figure  for  1930  is  estimated  at 54 millions, which is considerably below the high level years, but is not exceptionalin regard to the earlier figures in  the table; while present indications are that anyfurther measure  of  disarmament  in the near future is more likely  to involve areduction of existing ships and their cost of maintenance than a shrinkage of new construction below the present low level of  54 millions a year.  The present trend of naval discussions  would indicate an increase on that figure.     It is submitted that the effect, spread over such a vast employment area, of thevariations in new construction expenditure is  too small to justify such government action as is proposed.  The  result in terms of employment of the changes so fareffected and in contemplation appears to be relatively very  small, no greater than.indeed,  not comparable with the effect liable to be produced in individual industries by many possible decisions of  policy lying within the sphere of Government or by theprogress of invention, the change of fashion, or general changes in the character oftrade.     5.  While the paragraphs that follow deal  fully with the detailed &quot; remedies &quot;  inthe memorandum, it  is submitted that unemployment arising from changes in naval policy, at any rate on any scale so far in sight, is only a part, and, indeed, a verysmall one, of the general problem of unemployment.   In particular,  the proposals  inthe memorandum in regard to monetary compensation (see IV (vi) below) would havefar-reaching  consequences  on other  industries, where loss of employment  may bedue, e.g., to Government policy in connection with Coal mines, or to rationalisation    (B.) Employment in the shipbuilding trades generally and the question of                            Government  assistance.    6.  On  the  general  question  of  Government  assistance   to  shipbuilding,representations have been received from  the Boilermakers  and  Iron  and  SteelShipbuilders&apos; Executive Council, and a deputation on the subject was received by thePrime Minister in August 1929.  No kind of promise was made in respect of any ofthe proposals put forward.   A  deputation  from  the Shipbuilding  Employers&apos;Federation also met the Lord Privy Seal on the 8th November, 1929, at his request,when the whole question of facilities for shipbuilding was gone  into.  It emerged from this discussion that there was no desire on the part of the shipbuilding industry for a return to Trade Facilities, the general opinion being that the industry ought toibe able to continue to provide the necessary  finance.  It is, moreover, abundantly clear  from the public utterances  of shipowners that the shipowning industry as awhole is strongly opposed to any Government assistance.  On the 24th July, 1929, atthe Annual  General Meeting of Messrs. Furness, Withy  and Company, Limited,Sir Frederick Lewis made the following statement:-          &quot; I  am not  convinced that in the  long  run the granting of financial    assistance under the Trade Facilities Act  is any real and lasting benefit for the    reason that, as I have already shown, there is  ample tonnage afloat, and any    addition to that tonnage which is  either accelerated or  encouraged by financial
    assistance only tends in the long  run to increase the difficulties of  the ship-    owning industry and must ultimately reflect itself in a still deeper depression    in the shipbuilding trade.   It has never been the experience of  the lines that    when  ships  were  really  needed  and  could  be  profitably  employed  their    construction has been hampered for lack  of financial  assistance.   Therefore    ....  my own belief is that, taking the broad view, it is an undesirable measure    under conditions which exist at present.&quot;    7.  The attitude of the Government towards assisting shipbuilding by means oftrade facilities was explained by the Lord Privy  Seal in the House of Commons onthe 19th  July,  1929,  and again by  the Chancellor  of the  Exchequer  on  the18th  October,  1929,  when  he  received a  deputation  from the - amalgamated engineering Union.  The Chancellor then quoted what the Lord Privy Seal had saidwhen he was dealing with his Bill for  giving assistance to public utility companies(the Development Bill).  The Lord Privy Seal had been asked why he did not apply the general principle of trade facilities to all businesses.  He said         &quot; I will answer the House quite frankly by saying that representations have    been made in that  direction, but I refused  to do so and  shall continue to refuse    to  do  so, because  there is at  this moment  a tremendous amount of  good    rationalisation taking place.  I am Only sorry  it has not taken  place  before.-    There are all manner of reorganisations towards efficiency in  many industries    in this country long overdue, and for us to hold out at this stage any  hope of    artificial help would be to stop that very  reorganisation that is so essential, and    would merely  mean bolstering up inefficiency.  That we are not going to do.    That is the reason why I have not included that and have limited the  Bill in    the way I have indicated.   Finally, I would say that those undertakings will    not be able to complain, because in the end they must benefit by a more efficient    and cheaper transport system.&quot;.    The Chancellor, having quoted the Lord Privy Seal,  then went on as follows :           &quot; We have so  much practical evidence of it. I  think  there is a very great    deal to be said as to the effect which the  prospect of trade  facilities would have:  &quot; in stopping the reorganisation of  these businesses.  . . .  But I do believe that    there  is a very real danger in encouraging private firms to look  for State    assistance which will just keep them going in their  old incompetent,  inefficient    way, instead  of their  having to  face  up to the fact that they have got to    reorganise their  industry from top to bottom and make it efficient.  The    application  of  the  old  Trade Facilities  method there is  no doubt about it-    had something of the same effect as a protective  tariff, and that is bolstering up    inefficiency and retarding a real constructive effort to  try to  make themselves.    able to capture markets.&quot;    8.  The  fallacy underlying proposals for  assisting shipbuilding by  means ofTrade Facilities or other methods is that the  carrying  trade  is waiting for  moreships, whereas,  in  fact, there are more ships  than  can economically be  employed&apos;.The following figures (Millions of tons) of World and United Kingdom tonnage are.-of interest :     The actual increase in potential carrying power  is greater than these figures show, as modern ships are  faster and better carriers than the old ships.    9.  Figures are not available for comparing  the  world&apos;s ocean trade in 1913with that of 1928, but a comparison of the trade to and from the United Kingdomgives  the following (millions of tons) :-  1913 1924*1928 1929World 43 61-5 65 66-4 UnitedKingdom.18-31919-820191319241928Imports.Exports.565856-593-680-169-3[20581]B 2
    The drop in the export figures is almost entirely due to the falling off in theexport of coal.  Figures for 1929 are not available, but the increase in the quantityof coal exported for that year will not bring the total exports and imports to the 1913figures.    10.  It will be seen,  therefore, that whilst  there  is a progressive  increase in tonnage, there is, so far as the United Kingdom trade is concerned, a  decrease inthe amount of commodities to be carried, and the effect of this is that ships have tomake more voyages in ballast,  or sail less fully loaded than formerly.    11.  There is little reason to doubt that the conditions are the same with worldtonnage generally, and this view is supported by the fact that freight rates, which inthe long run reflect world supply and demand for shipping, are for 1929 only from5 per cent,  to 10 per cent, above the 1913 level, whilst ships&apos; operating charges are, ofcourse, very much higher.  For the last month of 1929 freight rates were actuallylower than they were in 1913.   The January freight rate index is 13 per cent, belowthe figure for 1913.    12.  It is clear, therefore, that any artificial stimulus to shipbuilding can onlyserve to prolong the period  before there is  a closer  correspondence between thequantity of goods to be carried overseas and the shipping available to carry  it, i.e.,to prolong  the depression in the carrying trade.    13.  It has been suggested that there was a shortage of coal-carrying ships andalso of tankers, and it is the fact that for a short time there was a difficulty in gettingships of the right kind to carry coal from some ports in the United Kingdom.   Butthis shortage, such as it was, was due to purely temporary causes, and there is morethan enough tonnage to carry all the coal this country can export.    14.  The position with regard to the supply of tanker  tonnage is  interesting.At the beginning of  1929 there was a considerable amount of tanker tonnage laidup and freight rates were very low.  Since then tanker tonnage has been more in demand, and the following figures  show that  this has been followed by  an increasein the tanker tonnage under construction in 1929 :                                                            Thousands                                                             of tons.Quarter ending the 31st March     Great Britain  and Ireland ...       ...       ...    148    Foreign countries ...       ...       ...       ...    183             Total      ....      ...      ...       ...    331Quarter ending the 30th June     Great Britain  and Ireland ...      ...       ...    171    Foreign countries  ...       ...      ...       ...    167             Total      ...       ...      ...       ...    338Quarter ending the 30th September     Great Britain  and Ireland ...      ...       ...    226    Foreign countries  ...       ...      ...       ...    174             Total    ....      ...       ...       ...    400..Quarter ending the 31st  December     Great  Britain and Ireland ...       ...       ...    398    Foreign countries  ...      ...       ...       ...    230Total     ...      ...       ...      ...     628    Freights have steadily  been rising (e.g.,  Gulf to United Kingdom/Continentnow 39/-), and it has been stated in the Press that no fewer than 70 motor tankerswere ordered during October.and November alone, and that about 1,000,000 tons of tankers are now &quot; on order.&quot;  The case of the tankers shows that any expansion inthe world&apos;s demand  for a particular type of tonnage is quickly and automaticallymet by ordinary economic processes without any Government stimulus.
TV. NOTES ON SPECIFIC PROPOSALS IN T.U.C. MEMORANDUM.                           (i.) Colonial  Development.     15.  The T.U.C. memorandum proposes           &quot; That alternative work of suitable character brought forward by reason     of the Grants for Colonial Development work should be diverted to the districts     hit by disarmament by a  Cabinet  decision  that, &apos; other things  being equal,     preference  should be given to tenders from those districts adversely  affected by     disarmament.&apos; &quot;     16.  By no means all the money which is granted for Colonial Development is spent upon orders in this country, and, moreover, a good deal of  time must elapse before Colonial  development proceeds to the full extent at which Government policy aims.  The possible scope of this proposal is therefore limited.     In theory, no doubt, it would be possible to divert those orders that are received to depressed areas, &quot; other thing being equal.&quot;  But, in fact, other things are not likely to be equal.  It must be remembered that        (i)  money can only be spent as directed by the Act, i.e., &quot; for the  purpose of           aiding and developing agriculture  and  industry in  the  Colony,  and           thereby promoting commerce with or industry in the U.K.&quot;  Discrimina-           tion  in favour of a particular industry and a particular area in the U.K.           would, if carried far, constitute an  undue stretching of this provision;     (ii) part of the money is put up by the Colonies themselves;    (iii)&quot; it would be wrong to discriminate  (say) against Birmingham or Bristol in           favour of a &quot;depressed  area &quot;  for  a  railway wagon order,  or  against           Coventry for  a motor car order.     The T.U.C. memorandum itself recognises  that not much help can be expected from this  source, for in paragraph 18 it records the &quot;growing impression&quot; that &quot; there is more eagerness in this country to receive and to supply monetary induce- ments for  Colonial orders than there is anxiety  in the- Colonies for such  work to be undertaken.&quot;                                  (ii.) Russia.     17.  So far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it is recommended in the summary of the proposals that Trade with Russia should be stimulated by the reintroduction of the Trade Facilities Act, in order to secure  as large a share as possible of the engineering and ship-building orders that  could  then be  placed by that country. Reference  is made to statements on behalf of the Soviet Government to  the recent Anglo-Russian Trade  Delegation and by Sir Joseph Isherwood on behalf of the Delegation.  Special mention is made of a proposal for His Majesty&apos;s Government to lend to the London and Northern Trading Company, Limited, a sum of four million pounds at 5 per cent, for sixteen years as a first mortgage upon a fleet of one hundred steamers of five thousand tons each, to be built in the United Kingdom for use in the Baltic timber trade.     18.  It would seem that the writers of the memorandum have not distinguished between a loan such as proposed to the London and Northern Trading Company on the one hand,  and on the other a revival of the Trade Facilities Scheme in such  a form as to include transactions with the Soviet Union.  It was, of course, not the case that under  the  Trade  Facilities Act His Majesty&apos;s Government made loans; all they did was to guarantee loans in such a way that  approved borrowers could raise their money at favourable  rates.  Therefore, the proposed transaction  with the London and Northern Trading Company could not in any case be brought within the scope of legislation on the lines of the former Trade Facilities Act.    19.  Apart  from  the  particular case of the London  and Northern Trading Company,  what  the  writers of  the memorandum have in  view is  probably trade facilities in the  form of  Government guarantees of long credits, e.g., from two to five years,  under the Export Credits Guarantee Scheme.   At present, whilst theDepartment administering  the  Scheme have approved  a substantial amount ofRussian business in connection with short credits up to one year, they have not seen
their way to guarantee long credits in respect of such business.   Whether this will-eventually  come about  would appear to depend largely  upon the  course  of  theforthcoming negotiations with the Soviet Government,    20.  It may be pointed out that the  figures of all orders placed in Englandwhich are quoted in the memorandum are a most misleading guide to the real valueof the export trade of British manufactured goods to the Soviet Union.  Until theyear 1926, it was the habit of the Soviet Government to order from the London offices of their trading organisation a  large quantity of foreign  goods, which never camenear England on route for  Russia.   As, however, the orders were placed throughthe London offices they appear in the accounts of those institutions as orders placedin England.  Nor was it a fact that British citizens obtained any considerable share-of  the middleman&apos;s  profits in  these transactions, since both the  shipping and insurance, as well as the clerk hire, were  controlled by the Soviet Government.  TheBritish Customs figures for the years cited are as follows : EXPORTS to Russia.                         Imported Merchandise                                                of Foreign orYear ending-                    Produced in ILK.      Colonial Origin.                                  1,000               1,000   1925               ...         6,240             13,017   1926      ...       ...         5,858              8,543   1927      .......         4,508              6,782   1928      ...       ...         2,716              2,084    21.  It should  be explained  that at  present  the Soviet Union, which isendeavouring  to  restrict  its  commitments  according  to  a carefully  worked  outschedule known as the Five Year Plan, is not in a  position to undertake further expenditure outside this scheme unless it is  assured of a corresponding amount of credit necessary to pay for the work involved.  It is also the case that the proposals under the Five Year Scheme are placed in  two categories of priority, viz., thosewhich are essential from the point of view of the Soviet Union, and those which are desirable if the finance can be found.    22.  So far as is known, such ship-building proposals as have been referred toin Soviet publications in  connection with the Five Year Plan are as follows,  viz.,that the Soviet mercantile fleet is to be increased by 117 cargo and passenger ships of a total capacity of 424,000 tons.   It is not stated wdiere. these vessels are to be built, but up to the present such orders for new tonnage as the Soviet  Governmenthave placed have been given to German firms. It may be noted in passing that untilthe summer of 1929 the Soviet Government have been obliged to charter foreign ships for the transport of goods, although it was originally planned to spend large sumson the development of shipping to render the Soviet  Union independent of foreignvessels by the year 1930.   This project was abandoned OAving to financial stringency.    23.  The proposal that His Majesty&apos;s Government should lend  4,000,000 to theLondon and Northern Trading  Company to build ships in this  country for theBaltic timber trade is outside, and additional to, any ships which might be built by the Soviet  Government in accordance with  the Five Year Plan.    It  is doubtfidwhether the  Soviet  Government will be able to  complete  its own ship-building-programme, and it  might welcome British Government assistance  in connectionwith the timber ships in  question.  What appears certain is that, failing Govern-ment help, the Company  will not get ships built in this country or elsewhere.    24.  The   London and  Northern  Trading Company  was  registered  inSeptember  1910, and has  an authorised capital of one million pounds in one poundshares (of which 20,007 shares have been issued for cash and  899,993 shares issued for a consideration other than cash).  The directors are :                  Morduch Schalit,                 Lip man Schalit, and                 Joseph  Kagan,all naturalised British subjects of Russian origin.   The capital of the concern is very fully employed, and it has made very heavy losses.  According to their  last balance
m                           (iii.)  Old British Tonnage.    27.  In view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ reply, quoted in paragraph above,  the writers of the memorandum express the opinion that there is little hopeof the extension  of Trade Facilities to shipbuilding, although later they  propose the re-introduction of  Trade Facilities  for industry  in general.  They turnaccordingly to a scheme for scrapping old tonnage.  They propose that the Board ofTrade  should appoint a Committee to consider the whole matter with a view to theentire prohibition of the sale to foreigners of  any British-owned vessel over twenty years old and to advise what regulations should be framed to ensure that no undueadvantage  should be taken by running  a vessel after its normal  life.   In thisconnection  the  opinion is expressed that  the inspection  services  of the  Board  ofTrade  would require &quot;tightening- up.&quot;    28.  It is  suggested in the memorandum that various advantages would flow from this scheme.   The shipbuilding yards would be busy, the steel industry would obtain the scope it requires,  freights would improve and shipbuilders would  get new orders both from  British and foreign shipowners.    29.  A prohibition of the sale of old tonnage to foreigners  could not of course be imposed without legislation.   But,  so  long as the Anglo-German  commercial treaty is in force, we are debarred by Article 10 of the Treaty and Clause  3 of the protocol to the Treaty from imposing any fresh prohibition on export other thanprohibitions designed for certain  rigidly defined objects.   Before  the proposal putforward in the Memorandum by the Trade Union Congress could be given effect  to,therefore, it would be necessary to denounce the Treaty or obtain  a modification ofits terms in  agreement with the  German Government.  The  Treaty can  only  be terminated at twelve months&apos; notice.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have also ratified theInternational  Convention dealing with import and  export prohibitions and thisConvention has now been brought into force  temporarily by the  Protocol  recentlysigned at Paris.  So long as it  remains in  force, it will be impossible to impose  theprohibition required.    30.  The suggested prohibitions could not fail to  make the  ship breaking yardsmore busy and the total supply  of scrap would be increased, although an increase inscrap exports might take place and to that extent British  steelmakers would not benefit.  But apart from these considerations, there would be serious objections to theproposed prohibition.   By selling our surplus  tonnage to foreign countries we have in the  past found a very convenient  market for the old tonnage which we  have  nolonger needed and it might Avell be  a mistake to lose this market.  Foreign ship-owners who have become acquainted with  British ships, even if old ones, are more likely to place  their orders  for new  ships  in this country  when they require themand can afford them.  Moreover the assumption in the memorandum that,  if foreign:sheet, dated the 31st December, 1928, the profit and loss account shows a loss of 692,007.   The Company has not inspired confidence in the City, and,  apart fromits financial position, the reason for this may perhaps be found in the fact that thecompany is believed to own about  50 per  cent, of the capital of the mixed Anglo-Russian company, Russangoles, Limited, the other  principal shareholder in  whichis the Russian Government institution &quot; Severoless.&quot;  Moreover, the business  of theLondon and Northern Trading Company, Limited, depends entirely on the goodwill of the Soviet Government,  since it consists in transporting  and selling timber of soviet origin.     25.  It would  appear, therefore, that  if His Majesty&apos;s  Government accordedthis company a, loan for sixteen years at favourable rates, it would be tantamount to according a loan to an organ which, while not  technically part of the  SovietGovernment machinery, is yet so closely inter-locked with that organism as to makethe effects of the loan indistinguishable from those which would result from a loan to the Soviet Government itself.     26.  It is important to bear in mind that these ships,  if built, would displace-an equivalent amount of Scandinavian tonnage which would compete still further in the freight  market and still further depress freights with  the consequent dis--encouragement of shipbuilding.  As pointed  out in paragraph 8 above, the fallacy atthe back of such proposals is that  there is carrying trade waiting for more  ships.The converse is the case; there  are more ships than can economically be employed.
countries are deprived of the possibility of getting our old ships at low prices, theywill be driven to order new ones is entirely fallacious.  The main reason for buyingold ships is that they cost less than new ones.  If consequently  foreign shipownersare deprived of old tonnage in this country they will look to other countries, e.g., theUnited  States  or Scandinavia, who are only too anxious to get rid of  their oldtonnage.  In other words, obsolete tonnage is a world problem rather than a nationalproblem.    31.  While, however, the proposal  to prohibit sales to  foreigners  is  againstTreaty,  obligations  and is generally open to serious objection,  there is  a certainmovement  toAvards  a well considered scheme for scrapping old and building new ships.   Several plans with this in view have been formulated in the  past and such proposals  have at times been  looked  on not  unfavourably even  by  individualshipowners.    32.  Two  schemes  have  actually  been  gone  into  by  Inter-departamental committees appointed for the purpose, who were unable to make recommendations intheir favour.  They were, briefly, as follows :     (1.) One proposal was to set  up a Trust Company to  buy  and  get broken up           two old  ships for  every one new ship that they had built.  There was no           guarantee, however,  that the old ships to be broken  up  were not ships           already on sale for that purpose which, if not sold to the Company, would           be broken up  anyhow.  The scheme  was to be  financed  by debentures           guaranteed  by the  Government.  The security for  the debentures,           however, was considered inadequate.    (2.) The other proposal was that a Government subsidy  should be paid with the           object of increasing the amount of British obsolete tonnage broken up  in           the near future, the amount of the subsidy to represent the difference  in           price to be obtained from the shipbreaker  and a purchasing shipowner           respectively.  It was thought (though it was by no means certain) that a           bounty of  20/- per ton  would be ample to secure the  object in view.  At           the time (1926): Sir Frederick Lewis expressed the view that the bulk  of           the obsolete tonnage then in existence  would be scrapped in the next few           years  without any subsidies, and that unwilling shipowners would  be           foreed to scrap by the expense of complying with the  requirements of the           classification society, such as Lloyd &apos;s  Register, in which their ships are           classed.   It  was  not proposed that the  grant of  the bounty should  be           conditional on the placing of  an order for a new ship and different views           were expressed by shipowners on the question whether the destruction of           the obsolete tonnage as the result of the bounty would in any case lead to           increased orders for shipbuilding.    33.  These schemes are not  based upon a  prohibition of  export,  and are,therefore, not in contravention of Treaty obligations. There is, therefore, no reason why, if  desired, the question should not be put to  a Committee whether a scheme forgetting rid of old British tonnage  is desirable, and, if  so, what form  it should take.if  it  were decided to set up a Committee,  its composition would require carefulconsideration,  e.g.,  whether shipowners,  shipbuilders  and  employees  should  be members or whether they should be confined to giving evidence.    34.  Such a  Committee  would no doubt consider that any  scheme of  the kindmust  be judged by its ultimate effect in increasing employment in  the  shipyards.That can be effected only by  an increased demand for ships consequent on  a rise  infreights.   If  the  only result  of scrapping old  ships in  this country  is there-employment of the old ships of other countries,  the ultimate effect on freightswould be negligible.    . 35.  It is difficult to follow the connection between scrapping of obsolete tonnage and the employment  of seamen  which is suggested in the memorandum, unless thehope  is that British Shipping  would acquire a still larger share  of the world&apos;scarrying trade by foreign countries no longer being able to obtain old tonnage from us.  But,  as  already pointed  out,  foreign  countries  can  easily get old tonnageelsewhere.   Moreover, British shipowners are now enabled to  get new tonnage builtwith the proceeds of sale of their old, and in the absence of a subsidy they would get more in this way than from shipbreakers.  It must also be remembered that new shipson the  whole employ fewer men than old  ships,  owing to improvements in design,propulsion, &amp;c.
    36.  Before leaving this subject it is right to compare the position of the BritishMercantile Marine with  that  of other countries  in  the  matter of old  tonnage.Everyone agrees that it is most desirable for the British Mercantile Marine to be asup-to-date  as possible, and anything that can be done economically to bring about this result is to be welcomed.    37.  A comparison, however, of our position with that of other countries showsthat, having regard to its size, the British Mercantile Marine is, on the whole, themost up to date in the world, and that, if there is to be any scrapping of old ships,it is rather for other countries in a worse position than ourselves to begin.    38.  The following is a rough statement showing the proportions of the tonnageowned by the United Kingdom, United States, Italy and Germany, which  is under, 10, 15, 20 and 25 years old respectively:                      United Kingdom. U.S.A.        Italy.      Germany.Under  5 years      ...     22-5         3-5         16-7         24 0Under 10 years      ...     47-8        37-8         37-8         64-0Under 15 years      ...     65-9        84-6         50-4         69-under 20 years      ...     83-1        90-4         59-9         79-7Under 25 years      ...     91-5        93-9         70-4         88-4       It should be noted that,  for the purposes of the above table, the amount of   United Kingdom tonnage is 20,000,000, United States over 11,000,000 (a good part   of which, however, is laid up and should properly not be taken into account at all),   whilst that of Italy is 3,250,000 tons only, and of Germany 4,000,000 tons.  Out of   the enormous total of 20,000,000 tons of United Kingdom snipping, over 22 per cent.   has been built in the last  five years.  In the case of the United States the proportion   is only 3-4 per cent., while in the case of Germany it is 24 per cent, out of the com-   paratively  small  total  of 4,000,000 tons,  and for that high percentage there are&apos;   obvious  special reasons.                    (iv.)  Merchant Shipbuilding in Royal Yards.       39.   The Memorandum proposes             &quot;  That any existing  disabilities placed  upon the Royal Dockyards should       be removed in order that these  establishments  should be  free  to tender for       merchant shipbuilding upon terms of equality with private firms.&quot;       40.   It is not considered desirable to bring the Royal Dockyards into active   competition with private firms for  merchant shipbuilding.       The Royal  Dockyards are not  now equipped  for shipbuilding on a  scale   comparable to that of the large shipbuilding  firms.   There is one big ship slip at   Portsmouth and Chatham and two at Devonport; in a  big private yard there may   be as  many as 10 to 16 slips with works all specially laid out for ship construction.   In the Royal Dockyards, repair and refitting work greatly predominate, and they are   very much better provided with docks than they are with building slips. The repair   and refitting work carried out  is largely of a specialist character on Naval material,   which, as a general rule, differs entirely  in design and specification from commercial   practice owing to the different requirements.   The Dockyards have grown up round   the Navy, and their experience has been obtained and their resources developed to   meet Naval needs. The whole  problem of Naval Dockyards work, in all branches, is,   in fact, very different, and unavoidably so, from that  in an  ordinary commercial   yard.  Moreover, the Dockyards are situated  at  ports which have been selected in   the past to suit Naval  requirements, whereas  the great private  shipbuilding yards   are usually to be found nearer to the industrial centres, where materials and allied   works in the  engineering  and other trades are close at hand.  It would not be&quot; in the   national interests to spend capital  in order to enable the Dockyards to undertake   with success other work which  the private yards already in existence in the country,   and possessing the advantage  of being able to consider  commercial interests alone,   are far more than sufficient to absorb.   If, in  consequence of Naval reductions, the.   amount  of  work  available for the national  warship yards becomes insufficient to-   occupy them all, it is considered that it would be much sounder policy to concentrate   it in  a smaller number of yards, leaving  the  surplus establishments available for   commercial development if required, rather than to attempt to maintain the existing   numbers of yards and workpeople by diverting merchant shipbuilding from private
yards fully capable of undertaking it.  Moreover, with the present strong movementin Italy, in the United States and  in  France, to encourage the home shipbuilding industry and not to place orders abroad, also the steadily reviving and progressivecommercial shipbuilding activities of Germany, it will almost certainly become moredifficult for these British private yards to obtain the work they require, even  in theabsence of  competition from Government yards.    41.  The Royal Dockyard at Sheerness is to-day surplus to Admiralty require-ments and  is available for other work.  It is submitted that, for the reason  stated above, it is undesirable that the Yard should be  run as a commercial venture  by theAdmiralty  or any other Department, and that early consideration should be given tothe question of its disposal on the best terms possible.    The Memorandum  itself recognises that the transfer  of work to GovernmentYards affords no solution.                         (v.)  Trade Facilities Generally.     42.   The Memorandum recommends the re-establishment of a Trade FacilitiesScheme similar to that which the late Government  allowed  to lapse at  the end ofMarch 1927.   The account given in the Memorandum of the general nature and working of the Scheme is substantially correct.  But the statement that the total loss to the Treasury, on guarantees amounting to  72J millions, was at the expiration of the period of the scheme  342,000, quite misrepresents the position.  Losses arenow approaching  1,000,000, and this is only the beginning of the tale, for      (a)  only some  7 millions has yet been  repaid, and as the period of repayment           approaches losses will become heavier,     (&amp;)  the Exchequer  has so far been lucky, and  this  luck may not hold; heavy           losses may, for instance, be incurred in relation to the R.M.S.P. Group.     43.   The scheme at all times exercised a depressing effect on Government credit.In its effect on the market a Government Guarantee is exactly equivalent to direct government borrowing, whether the loan is  found by an ordinary public  issue or bya group of lenders, such as the insurance  companies.  So long as the scheme lastedthe constant issue of  new guaranteed securities was  an incubus on the market, andits termination was a  relief.     44.   It is important  to bear in mind that the money  position is  essentiallydifferent from what it was when the old scheme started.   Then War Loan stood at85, while sound industrial debentures commanded 8 per cent.  When the Act expiredin 1927 Government  credit was  approximately on a 5 per cent, basis, while soundindustrial borrowing  cost 5\ per cent, or  less.  The saving by obtaining a Govern-ment guarantee was  insufficient to  attract the sounder  domestic concern seekingcapital, and such continuing demand for  guarantees as there was tended  to benarrowed to foreign schemes and ultra-speculative domestic schemes  which themarket  would not look  at on  any terms.   The situation  is much the same to-day.Trade Facilities could only assist the sound concern  in very small measure, and thebenefit would be sought mainly in quarters  where there is the least  case for  publicaid.  -     45.   There are two main purposes for which it has been suggested in  recent discussions and in the Memorandum of the General Council that Trade facilities should be once more provided.  These are      (a)  the establishment of  new works in existing industries, the extension of           existing buildings  and  plant,  the opening up of new mines, the building           of new ships;  and     (b)  the reorganisation of whole industries or sections of industries, or what is           frequently called &quot;rationalisation.&quot;     46.   Intermediate  between these  two,  but approximating in  its effects more closely to the second, there is the reconstruction of individual  works, the replacement.of machinery, and the reconditioning of mines.     47.   Between these two purposes of  Trade Facilities there is the fundamental difference that whilst (a) is  directed  towards the  immediate enlargement  of theproducing  capacity  of  an industry or  a part of an  industry,   (b) is directed
primarily towards the reorganisation  and reconstruction of  the  industry  on its existing basis of production,  and the enlargement of its output is an ultimate hoperather than an immediate goal.    48.  Trade Facilities applied to the first of  these purposes is intended to giveimmediately enlarged  employment in  the industries supplying  the capital goodsrequired (buildings, machinery,  &amp;c.) and also in  the industries using those goods in production. The former will certainly be stimulated if the amount of capital raised for the purchase of capital goods is&apos;in the  aggregate  increased.  As  regards thelatter, the amount of employment given to them will only be increased if the demandfor their products  is increasing or can be stimulated more or less pari passu  withtheir  enlarged capacity for  production.  If that is  the  case, the need for TradeFacilities is not apparent, since there is no reason to suppose that private capitalwill not be obtainable in such  instances; if it  is not the case, then the new orenlarged works will be competing in  an already satiated market.  In this connection it must be pointed out  that in most of the staple industries in this country, includingthe engineering trade, there is at  present  a very  substantial amount of plant,frequently  of  a quite  modern type, standing idle.   The case  of  shipbuilding isdiscussedin detail elsewhere in this Report.  The problem to be solved in most otherindustries  is similar,  viz.,  how to obtain an increase  of demand upon presentproductive capacity and not the increase in that capacity.    49.  The old scheme, in the conditions of 1921, when it was initiated, increasedproductive capacity without affecting  demand for the goods produced.  The resultof assisting one concern to  increase its  productive  capacity was to strike  at its competitors.  Complaints on this  score arose in  many quarters: from ship-ownersin respect of large guarantees given for ship-building ; from the heavy iron and steelindustry in respect of  the guarantee given for the completion of the Appleby works of the United Steel Company (works  which are  very well equipped and efficientlyrun,  but are  not  working  at anything like  full capacity) ;  and from the  calicoprinting industry in respect of a guarantee for new printing works.   The complaintwas that  a large  number of ships or a large amount  of plant  was standing idle,and that no useful purpose would be served by intensifying competition in therespective industries.     50.  As regards the second suggested purpose of Trade Facilities, the primary object of &quot; rationalisation&quot; is  to reduce the cost of production in the hope either of making the industry more remunerative on its present scale  and on its present level  of prices, or of stimulating demand by  reducing prices.   The first is probably the immediate objective of rationalisation schemes in British  industries to-day; thesecond is a later objective.  And the method pursued, whether it be the concentration of the operations  of  a number of  factories or  mines,  or the  re-organisation ofprocesses, or the introduction of improved machinery, aims at the reduction of theamount of  labour  required for a given output.   So that whilst the  process  maycreate a demand  for  new plant and  equipment for the industries  to which it is applied, and thereby  stimulate the  demand  for  labour in the industries supplyingthem, its immediate effect in the industry itself is almost always a decrease in that demand.  If the output be not increased, but only made more  remunerative,  thatreduction will be permanent;  and, on the other hand, if the economies in productionenable the numbers to be reduced, and demand  consequently  rises,  experience hasshown that it is likely to be some considerable time before the  demand for labourrises to its old level, if, indeed, it ever does so fully.     51.  The  writers of  the  memorandum understand  one objection  to there introduction of Trade Facilities  to be  that  their  provision  would  enablemanufacturers to  postpone reorganisation, and they appear to think that  this view is based upon a  fear that the Advisory Committee would be too  stringent in considering applications.  This is not the real difficulty.   It is that if Governmentoffered financial assistance, industrialists would tend to cease  to  make efforts to put their  own  house in order and  wait for Government help.   No scheme of  tradefacilities could be reintroduced  without fresh legislation, and after legislation hadbeen passed it would be for  individual concerns  to prepare schemes  for submission to an Advisory Committee.  The Committee,  in  its turn, would  require to examinethe schemes in detail.   Hence, if an offer of Government facilities were made now,it would be inevitable  that many months must elapse before any scheme approved bythe Government could be  put into  operation.  Meantime, the considerable efforts
which industry is to-day making of its own initiative would be relaxed  and muchvaluable time would be lost.  Moreover, the experience of the former scheme showsthat the discrimination between one concern and another, which a scheme of tradefacilities involves, disgruntles the unsuccessful applicants, and acts in this  way asa further deterrent to private initiative.     52.  It is essential not only that nothing could be done to hinder present effortsat reorganisation by holding out  contingent benefits in the future,  but that suchreforms  as are undertaken now  or hereafter should be fully as drastic as the needsof the situation require.  The process must be painful, but unless a real reform is achieved, there is no ground for  expectation that the new organisation will farebetter than its predecessor, or that it will contain seeds of growth such as will enable it in due course to reinstate the  labour which rationalisation must in its first effectsdisplace.     53.  Under any scheme  of  Government facilities it would no doubt be left toan Advisory Committee with a  strong membership to examine the various applica-tions that were received.  They w^ould require that the finance  of an undertakingwas  on sound lines and  appeared to give proper security for the money at stake.  Nodoubt such a Committee, suitably  constituted, would go a certain distance towardssecuring that the schemes  put forward met the  real needs of industry.  But it isdoubtful whether a Government Committee, with Government resources at its back,would be able to deal with schemes as drastically as financiers and accountants acting in a professional  capacity in connection with commercial propositions.  To take oneexample;  good  reorganisation  depends  quite  as  much upon the  personnel of undertakings as upon their financial arrangements, and it  is uncertain how far aGovernment  Committee would be able to insist, as the price of assistance, upon thekind of changes  in  personnel  which  are  often  required  by  those who  supplycommercial  finance.     54.  There would  indeed be a case for reviving Trade Facilities if it were truethat industries which are ready to put their house in order and to refashion them-selves so as to be able to compete successfully in the  world were unable  to raise ontheir own credit the necessary initial capital.  But that is not the case.   The City,led in this matter by the Governor of the Bank of England,  holds itself ready in anespecial  degree to handle this very question.  On the 10th January, 1930, the lord privy Seal made  a special announcement of this  fact.  The words  he used were :-         &apos;&apos; As a result of consultations I have had, I am now in a position to state     that the City is deeply interested in placing industry upon a broad and sound     basis and ready to support any plans that in  its opinion lead to this end.   Those     in the City who have been studying this matter are convinced that a number of     our important industries must be fundamentally re-organised and modernised,     in order to be able  to produce at  prices which will enable them to compete with     the  world.         Industries which propose schemes that, in  the opinion of those advising     the  City, conform  to this requirement will  receive the  most sympathetic con-     sideration and the co-operation of the City in working out plans and finding the     necessary finance.         In the case of individual undertakings, the City  will be similarly ready     to help,  provided that the scheme under discussion fits in as part of the  general     plans for the industry in question as a whole and gives reasonable promise that     the  changes will enable the  undertaking to become an effective unit in combina-     tion and co-operation  Avith  other similar undertakings.&quot;                          (vi.) Monetary Compensation.    55.  The T.U.C. memorandum proposes that &quot; if, in spite of all efforts to securesuitable work, workpeople are still thrown out of employment by measures of disarma-ment, monetary compensation should be paid to the AArorkpeople affected.&quot;   So far as government  employees are concerned, their proposal  is that legislation should beintroduced amending  the  provisions  of the Superannuation  Acts,  so as  to enablespecial rates of compensation on loss of office to be granted; and that  the  case ofAvorkmen in  the employ of private firms who are discharged  in consequence of the cancellation  of Admiralty orders  should be met by  means  of legislation providingfor the grant of compensation allowances  of an amount to be decided in  each case
by  referees appointed  by the Ministry of  Labour.   The  Memorandum  furtherrecommends that the legislation so to be passed should apply retrospectively so asto extend to workmen in Government or private employment who have already been discharged as a result of the  slowing down of naval construction that has  already taken place.     56.  These proposals are  fundamentally unsound.  Parliament has specificallylaid down the conditions to be  applied in cases where Government  employees aredischarged on reduction : broadly speaking, the law on this subject contemplatesthe grant of compensation in such  cases equivalent to the amount  of pension orgratuity that would have been  payable  if  retirement had been due to ill-health.From the point of view of the Civil Servant, who is obliged to retire, it is immaterialthat the loss of his office is by reason of some specific economy; and it would clearly be wrong in principle to vary the amount of compensation to be paid according tothe particular circumstances in which a reduction of establishment had been effected.Moreover, if  special terms of  compensation for loss  of office were to  be granted inthe present case, it would equally be  necessary to grant the  same special terms in allother cases where it could be argued that discharges on reduction were in any degreeattributable to the need for economy or could in any way be related to a saving ofGovernment expenditure.  The  same argument,  mutatis mutandis, applies  to theproposal  as   it  would  affect  employees   of outside firms.    Apart  from theimpracticability of identifying among the general body of  unemployed those whoseunemployment is attributable to disarmament, it  would indeed be a perversion ofjustice for the Government to decide that such employees as might be shown definatly to have lost their employment  through a slackening off of Government orders shouldbe given special compensatory benefits for  which their  fellow workmen suffering alike misfortune through the cessation of private orders are not eligible, and to which,moreover, they are obliged as  taxpayers to contribute.     57.  The position of servants of  certain undertakings dealt with by the Ministryof Transport Act, 1919, and the Electricity Supply Act,  1926,  to which  reference is made in the T.U.C. memorandum is wholly different.  Those Acts provide for the compulsory retention, transfer or abolition of certain undertakings and employmentthereunder.  The loss of employment for which compensation is provided is imposedupon the undertakers and their servants and no precedent can be  found in thisprovision for compensation  for loss of employment due to  the cessation of  aGovernment or private demand for certain products.                        V. SUMMARY OF  THIS  REPORT.     Introductory.                                                               Part i               &quot;                                                               (para. 1)     Summary of T.U.C. Memorandum.                                           Partn                                                                               (para. 2)     General  Comments on the Memorandum.                                     Partm     (A.) Disarmament. In speaking of disarmament the Memorandum is speaking ^paras 3-5^of a difficult ideal not yet attained.  Recent reductions in armament expenditure are relatively small, while the effect of  the reductions in new  construction since 1927,spread over such a vast employment area, is too small to  justify such government action as is proposed.     Unemployment due to Naval reductions is only a part, and, indeed, a very smallone, of the general problem of unemployment.     (B.) Employment  in the  Shipbuilding  Trades  generally and  the question of (paras 6.14)Government Assistance. Artificial stimulation would be contrary to  Governmentsannounced policy, is not desired by the  industry,  and  would only prolong thedepression in the  carrying trade.   The fallacy underlying proposals for assistingshipbuilding by Trade facilities or other methods  is  that the  carrying  trade iswaiting for more ships, whereas, in fact, there are more ships than can economicallybe employed.            Notes on Specific Proposals in the T.U.C. Memorandum.             Partrv                                                                               (paras. 15-57)     (i.) Colonial Development. The possible  scope of the proposal is very limited, (paras. is-i6(even if effect could be given to it without unfair discrimination against-certain areasor undue stretching of the Act.  The T.U.C. Memorandum itself recognises  that not much help can be expected from  this source.
              (ii.)  Russia. The specific proposal that His Majesty&apos;s Government should lend           4 millions to the London and Northern Trading Company, Limited, for the building          of a fleet of 100 steamers is discussed.  The Company has not inspired confidence, and          a loan to it would be tantamount to a loan to the Soviet Government.  The proposal          is further open to the objection already pointed out under III B, namely that there-          are already more ships than can economically be employed.              (iii.)  Old British  Tonnage. The prohibition of the sale  to foreigners of old          British  tonnage would require legislation, which, in its turn, would conflict  with          certain international agreements.              The prohibition would make shipbuilding yards busier, but, as against this, our          trade in old ships-would simply pass to others.  It is suggested that a Committee be          asked to consider whether a scheme for getting rid of old British tonnage is desirable          and if so what form it should take.              British tonnage is, in fact, the most up-to-date in the world.(paias. 39-41)     (iy.) Merchant  Shipbuilding  in Royal Yards. It is not desirable to bring the          Royal Yards into active competition with private firms.  They are not equipped for          the work, and if they were the diversion of work to them would still further cripple          the private yards.              It is better policy to concentrate the  naval w^ork in fewer Yards.   Sheerness          Yard is surplus to Admiralty requirements and early consideration should be given          to the question of its disposal.              (v.)  Trade  Facilities   generally. The   loss  to  the  Treasury  is  greatly          under-estimated in the Memorandum.  Trade Facilities by  stimulating certain          productive  capacity  without increasing  demand merely intensified  destructive          competition;  while   if  rationalisation  and  reorganisation  is  the   aim   the          reintroduction  of the scheme would  retard  the  efforts now being made  in that          direction.              The Lord Privy Seal has recently announced that the City itself is prepared to          help any schemes for putting industry on a sound  basis, and this should achieve the          desired objects.(paras. 55-57)     (vj) Monetary Compensation. The proposal to grant special compensation to          employees  of  Government or  of  private  firms displaced  by  disarmament  is          fundamentally  unsound.  As regards Government employees,  provision is already          made for termination of employment and discrimination in favour of those displaced          in particular circumstances would be unfair.  It would be  still more  unfair that          employees displaced through slackening of Government orders should be given special          benefits  for  which their  fellow  workmen,  suffering  a  like  misfortune  through          cessation of private orders, are not eligible, but to which, as taxpayers, they would          contribute.February 10, 1930.

The letter from the Transport Workers and Workers&apos; Union requesting theformation  of a  joint  committee  to  deal with the  Economic  Consequences  of disarmament  states :           &quot;It is the opinion of my  Executive Council that the consequences of dis-    armament should not be borne exclusively by the men employed in the dockyards,    particularly  having regard to the fact  that  the country  is  bound  to  gain    financially as a  result of disarmament.   My Executive Council  is therefore    of the opinion that special steps  should be  taken  to see that a portion of the    gain is set aside  for the benefit of the men who must inevitably be  displaced or    have their status affected.&quot;    In  the first  place  it  should be pointed  out  that the  decision to appoint  a tripartite  Committee to consider these problems should not be regarded as in anyway implying that the Trade  Union and Labour movement is antagonistic  towardsthe policy  of  disarmament at present being pursued by  the  Government.  On thecontrary, there is no line of international policy that commands the  same undividedand enthusiastic support of the working class movement as the gradual  and  effectiveelimination of armaments of all description.The Problem.    2.  The  letter quoted  above refers to  the men employed in the dockyards whohave been and who will be detrimentally affected by disarmament, but it is impossibleto limit consideration to these  classes of  workpeople.    The more the problem  isstudied, the wider becomes the area of disturbance. This memorandum is  directed towards the  difficulties arising  from  the  measure   of naval  disarmament  soenergetically  enforced  by  the  present  Government   because  the  difficulties  areimmediate  ones, and  because any methods  or machinery that can be found to solvethese  difficulties  can afterwards be  adapted  towards the problems  of  militarydisarmament when the opportunity arises.    The chief loss of employment arises  from  the curtailment of the Admiraltybuilding programme.   Orders for two cruisers  and a submarine depot  ship, severalsubmarines, a flotilla leader-and several destroyers have been cancelled.  In orderto visualise the amount of money thus removed  from the national pay-roll, it may be stated that the cost of an &quot;A&quot; type cruiser (10,000 tons) is 2^ millions  of pounds, aflotilla leader (1,300-1,500 tons) costs approximately  275,000, while  a submarinecosts approximately  400,000.    3.  The  Naval estimates  for 1929 state that  the  sum of  7,686,000  has beenvoted for  new construction during  1929, of  which   1,967,000 is allocated  fordockyard-built ships,  534,000  for the machinery  for these ships, while  the cost for the  year of  vessels building in private shipyards  is given as   5,184,000.   In
addition &quot;repairs  and alterations&quot;  are  estimated  to cost  5,259,000 practicallythe whole of which is done in the dockyards.  The  grand total of  12,965,000 canbe sub-divided as follows :                                             Dockyard Work.                                     Labour.   .       Materials.      Contract Work.     Dockyard-built ships                                                        Hulls, &amp;c.   ...       ...     647,420         405,280         915,117         Machinery  ...       ...     111,450        .  37,140         386,234     Contract-built ships          Hulls, &amp;c.            ...     126,230         258,760        2,884,715         Machinery  ...       ...       ...              ...           1,914,601     Repairs         ...       ...    3,403,800        1,196,920         659,094             Totals  ...       ...    4,288,900        1,898,100        6,759.761    As the total &quot; contract work &quot; includes materials, the  comparable totals are:          Dockyard  Work (labour and materials) :   6,187,000.         Contract Work (labour and materials) :   6,759,761.The Admiralty figures are exclusive of overhead charges.    The firms concerned in the above work (in addition to  the dockyards) includeMessrs. Parsons Steam Turbine Co.; W. Beardmore (Dalmuir); Hawthorne, Leslie  &amp;Co. (Newcastle-on-Tyne); Fairfield  Engineering  Co.  (Govan); Vickers  (Barrow);Cammell  Laird  (Birkenhead); Palmers  (Jarrow);  Swan  Hunter  and  WighamRichardson  (Wallsend-on-Tyne);  John Brown  (Clydebank); J.  I.  Thorneycroft(Woolston); Scotts  Engineering Co.  (Greenock); in greater or less degree.    4.  These details are given.to show the distribution (financial and geographical)of the bulk of the Admiralty votes among the shipbuilding and engineering firms ofthis country. In addition the following industries are affected in varying degrees by the Naval estimates :         &apos; (a.) Iron ore, pig iron and steel making.         (6.) Coal.         (c.) General Engineering.         (d.) Electrical  Engineering.         (e.) Armour Plate and Gun Making.         (/.) Chemical (explosives).         (g.) Transport.    The claims of  the Royal Yards have  been more prominent than the  claims ofother areas, because the Dockyards are solely dependent upon Admiralty  orders,while private yards have the opportunity of seeking work in other fields.  This has given rise to an agitation for the  gradual transfer  of  Admiralty building orders from  private yards to the dockyards.  From a national point of view this is no solution to the problem, as it simply transfers unemployment from  one district toanother.  In addition, the shrinkage of Admiralty work will affect the amounts paid for materials  (steel  plates,  castings,  general engineering  products, &amp;c),  thuscausing unemployment,  unaffected by the district in which the ships  are built.    5.  The Trade  Unions  directly  connected  with  the  Admiralty IndustrialCouncil have spent considerable time  in  compiling suggestions  for  &quot; alternative work,&quot; but  the  majority of these suggestions are open  to the same qualification,i.e., they involve the transfer of work rather than the creation of new employment.    It  is submitted that  the ideal solution  to the  problem must fulfil threeconditions :     (a.) It  must add to the volume  of employment at present available.    (&amp;.) It  must distribute the new  work as far as possible in the same proportions           to the same  districts as existing Admiralty work.    (c.)  The new work should be of such a nature  as can be performed by the trades           and grades affected without appreciable loss of efficiency.    It  will be seen that the problem is a  miniature of the general  unemployment problem confronting the country at present.
Suggested Solutions.    6.  The solutions  that appear to  be practical can  be  divided into  two categories :-    (a.) Alternative work  of  a suitable  character,  not  at present available to           industry, but specially promoted because of unemployment from various           causes, rationed  direct to the areas affected, existing restrictions placed           upon Government Dockyards to be removed if necessary.    (&amp;.) Specific  Government action to increase employment in the two industries           principally affected,  failing which  adequate  monetary  compensation to           workpeople displaced.A alternative Work.    7.  It is extremely  difficult to  find any volume of  work that under existingtrade conditions is  not available  for private  commercial enterprise.  But  twoavenues can be explored  with some expectation of results if  financial assistance canbe arranged.   The effect of disarmament upon  the national finances is discussed later, and it is only necessary  to state here that if Government policy (howeverbeneficial  it may he  for the  nation  as  a whole)  directly results in  increasedunemployment  in  specific  areas or   industries,  then  sufficient  of  the savingsanticipated by  that policy should be used to remove the unemployment.    The whole of the industrial world is fighting savagely for the markets  thatexist  at present,  and  it appears necessary to seek markets that are not yet fully developed.  China can be ruled out owing to the very unsettled state of that country,both in politics and in industry.  There remain the British Dominions and Colonies,and Russia.(a.) Colonial Development  Work.    8.  The Cabinet has sanctioned the sum of one million pounds per annum asinterest  to be paid  upon  loans granted for Colonial Development  work.   this represents a capital expenditure of  20 millions if  the full  cost is borne  by theBritish Government, but if  Colonial Governments can divide the burden equally, thecapital expenditure is increased to  40 millions.    The term  &quot;  colonial development&quot; covers many  activities  that are related toshipbuilding and engineering, including the building of coastal and river vessels,tugs, dredgers, oil fuel depot vessels,  railways,  bridges, aerodromes,  engines and rolling-stock, steel girders for buildings, factories and granaries, manufacture andinstallation of electrical plant and machinery, agricultural machinery, &amp;c.    The Colonial Development Committee recently formed under the chairmanship of Sir Basil Blackett are already  dealing  with business of this nature and  havealready considered and  recommended a considerable amount of work placed beforethem by the various Colonial  Governments.  The Committee  should be instructed by  the Colonial Office to take into account the effect of  disarmament  upon certain areas in allotting the approved orders,  and to make this effective, the  Governmentshould declare  that, &quot; other things being equal, preference should be given to tendersfrom those districts adversely affected by the policy of disarmament.&quot;     In the quite likely event of there being insufficient orders to fill  the gap  causedby the progress of disarmament, the Committee should have power to approach theCabinet direct  for a  reconsideration  of  the  financial  assistance  given by  theGovernment, either generally or in specific cases.(b.) Russia.     9.  The publication of the Report of the  Anglo-Russian Trade  Delegationreveals the fact  that a  very considerable amount of  work  for  this  country  can beobtained  provided adequate credit  facilities  are provided.  That our trade  withRussia has considerably diminished during  recent years is  shown by the followingtable :                                                                             In 1924-25 orders placed in England amounted to  ...   23,500,000          ,,  1925-26  .,,   .    ,,        ,,                 ...   20,500,000          ,,  1926-27   ,,       ,,        ,,         ,,       ...   14,100,000          ,,  1927-28   ,,       ,,        ,,                 ...   5,900,000
    When questioned regarding the nature of the requirements of the U.S.S.R.,Mr. Piatakov, Acting Chairman of the State Bank, who deputised for Mr. Litvinoff,informed the Delegation that the U.S.S.R. were prepared to place orders for boilers,turbines, dynamos, lathes, general machinery, textile machinery, machinery for coalmines and metallurgical works, chemical plants and paper mills, tractors, reapersand binders, pumps,  commercial vehicles, cold storage machinery,  elevators, motorcycles, commercial vehicles, &amp;c.    This has been further supplemented by  Sir Joseph Isherwood, the Chairman ofthe Delegation who informed the &quot; Journal of Commerce &quot; (the 31st October, 1929)that the Soviet Government wants to spend approximately  20 millions on new shipsduring the  next five  years.  At present U.S.S..R. owns 379 vessels of all classeswith  a  gross  tonnage of 440,506   The orders to be placed include  timber  andgrain carrying vessels of 5,000 to 8,000 tons&apos;, smaller timber vessels for coastal work,oil tankers, motor vessels for the Far Eastern  trade, vessels for inland water transport,  ice-breakers and floating  cranes.  (According to &quot; Lloyd&apos;s List&quot;  for september 112,073  tons gross of new shipping is  being built in Russia at present,of which 88,500 tons  are motor ships.)  Sir J. W.  Isherwood  also states that ifcredit facilities are forthcoming, much of  the main and auxiliary machinery forthese  vessels would be ordered in Britain.    10.  As a definite instance of orders that are waiting to be placed from thisquarter,  it  may be mentioned that the London and  Northern Trading Companydesire to have a fleet  of 100 steamers of about 5,000 tons each built in this countryfor the Baltic timber  trade.  The vessels would not only be built in Great Britain,but the Company is domiciled here, and the management and personnel would  be british.  The  cost of building these vessels is estimated at  5 millions, of which theCompany itself can raise  1 million.  They have asked the Government to loan them the remainder at 5 per cent, for sixteen years upon First Mortgages upon the fleet.    It is estimated that 30,000 shipyard workmen  would be employed upon thebuilding of these vessels, and that 3,000 seamen would be engaged upon  a trade thatis now controlled by  Scandinavian firms, and it is  suggested  that these factors,as well as the amount of coal and  steel consumed, and  the advantages secured byother trades should favourably impress the Government and should  secure their support for the plan.    The First Commissioner for Works, however, has stated that, after  consultationwith the Lord Privy  Seal&apos;s Department, he regrets that no assistance can be givento private Companies under the Development (Loan Guarantees) Act.   It appearsto be necessary to re-introduce the  Trade Facilities  Act before private companiescan obtain the same financial assistance that is at present extended to Public UtilityCompanies.  This point is more fully discussed later.Government Action to Increase Employment in Trades affected.    11.  Any direct  Governmental action  taken to reduce unemployment in the shipbuilding and Engineering trades in addition to the action proposed above \will,  generally speaking, largely compensate for losses  of  employment throughdisarmament.  Shipbuilding is one of the best customers of the iron and.steel trades,and is also a very good client of the engineering industry ; it follows, therefore,  thatany impetus that can be given to shipbuilding will be speedily felt in these trades.Several prominent leaders in the Shipbuilding industry have repeatedly urged  thatthe Trade Facilities Act should be applied to this country, but the very  recent reply of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Executive Committee of the amalgamated engineering Union leaves  little hope  that there is any  chance of  progress in thisdirection.  Some of the Shipbuilding trade papers have criticised the suggestion onthe grounds that  there is already  a surplus of  tonnage in the world,  and anyartificial boom produced at the present time would only accentuate difficulties in thenear future.   We do  not agree with this criticism, but feel bound to explore otheravenues.    12.  According to Lloyd&apos;s List, there are 260,000 tons of British tonnage laidup at present through scarcity of  freights.  It is estimated that  two seamen are engaged for every  100 tons of shipping;  this idle tonnage, therefore, representsunemployment to  probably  15,000  seamen,  wharfingers, transport workers,  &amp;c.There is also a great scarcity of steel scrap,  so great, indeed, that the late Presidentof the Board of Trade formed an expert committee to investigate means for obtainingother supplies. Ship-breaking yards, usually situated near shipbuilding yards, are
on short time through scarcity of old vessels. At the same time, British shipownersare  selling old vessels to foreign competitors at little more than  scrap  value,596,351 tons gross being sold in 1926, and 856,438 tons gross in 1927.     If the sale of these old vessels to foreigners was prohibited, the following chain of events would occur : The ship breaking yards would be busy, the steel  industry would obtain its scrap, the idle tonnage at present laid up would be released, freightswould improve,  and the chances  of  new  shipbuilding  orders  would  be greatlyenhanced.   In addition, foreign competitors would either have to buy new tonnageor reduce their fleets. If they bought new tonnage, a large part of the  orders would come to this country, but, even  if they went elsewhere for their vessels, competition with our freight-owners would be upon a more equitable basis  than  at present, and capital charges would be more fair.     In view of the national advantages to be derived from the  scrapping of  oldtonnage, it is considered that the whole matter should be considered  by a committeeappointed by the Board of Trade with a view to  the entire  prohibition of the saleof any British-owned  vessel over  20 years old.  This  Committee  would  also berequired to advise what  regulations should be  framed  to  ensure  that no  undueadvantage could be taken by running a vessel long after  its normal life, and wouldprobably be  forced to the conclusion that the  inspection services of the Board ofTrade would require &quot;  tightening up &quot; in this  connection.Monetary Compensation.     13.  There remains the problem of those districts or factories for which satis-factory forms of alternative work cannot be found.  These can be divided into two groups :  (a) Government employees; (b) private industrial employees.     (a.)  tip to the present the accepted solution of a surplus of workmen in Govern-ment employment has been with very few exceptions discharges upon reductionwith the gratuities (if any) to which the workmen concerned are entitled under  the superannuation Acts.   The workmen concerned  are very unwilling victims of  thecircumstances in  which they  find themselves.  .But if  it  were possible to offerredundant workmen such terms as would  enable them to  volunteer  to leave  theService,  or soften the hardships inflicted, it should be done.  This is possible, tosome  extent, without  any  amendment of the  existing   Superannuation Acts.Section 7 of the Act of 1859 lays it down .that:   &quot;It shall  be  lawful  for the Com-missioners of the Treasury to grant to any person retiring or removed  from the publicservice in consequence of the abolition of his office, or for the purpose of facilitatingimprovements in the organisation of the Department to which  he belongs, by whichgreater efficiency and economy can be effected, such special annual alloiuance by wayof compensation as on a full consideration of the circumstances of the case may seemto the said Commissioners to be a reasonable and just compensation for the loss of office; and if the compensation  shall exceed  the amount to which such person wouldhave been  entitled under  the scale of superannuation provided by this  Act if  tenyears were added to the number of years which he may have actually served, suchallowance  shall be granted  by a  special Minute, stating the  special grounds  for granting such allowance, which Minute shall be laid before Parliament, and no suchallowance shall exceed two-thirds of the salary and emoluments  of the office.&quot;  This-section has never been entirely repealed,  and clearly provides for increases to be madeto pensions to which Civil Servants are entitled by reason of  their length of service,if their retirement is deemed necessary  for the &quot; greater efficiency and  economy &quot; ofthe Department.   But the Act of 1909 (Section  6) limits the amount of compensation to persons  who entered  the Service after the passing of the 1909 Act to a sum &quot; notexceeding in any case the amount to which  a Civil Servant would be entitled if heretired on the  ground  of ill-health&quot;  (i.e., actual years  of  service).   Such graveabuses ensued from  the practice of &quot; adding years,&quot; that the Ridley Commissionupon the Civil  Service (1888-89) caused strong  debates in Parliament,  and thepractice  was discontinued.   Under suitable safeguards,  it should be recontinued,.and  the older men induced to  resign  by &quot; adding years &apos;&apos; to  secure for them thepensions to which they  would be entitled if they were allowed to remain until thenormal retiring age.  The Treasury should be asked to introduce a short amendingAct providing for similar compensation for those who entered after 1909, and thoseemployees (&quot; hired persons &quot;) who are not entitled  to pension  rights.     14.--(&amp;.) The case of workmen in the employ of private firms (or who have been discharged through cancellation of Admiralty  orders) can be met by applying theprinciples embodied in  the Electricity  (Supply) Act  of  1927,  which lays  it down
that any officer or servant whose employment is abolished or worsened as a result ofthe Act shall receive compensation, the amount in each case to be awarded by refereesappointed by the Ministry of Labour.     The Ministry of Transport Act (1919) states : &quot; Any  officer or servant  ....who suffers any direct pecuniary loss in consequence of this Act .... shall beentitled to be paid by the Minister, compensation for such  pecuniary loss.&quot;  Theamount of  compensation is to be assessed by the Treasury,  with the right of  appealto arbitration.   Similar provisions for payment  of compensation for  &quot;pecuniaryloss &quot; is provided  for in the Railways Act, 1921.     The principle of compensation for loss of employment brought about by  Act ofParliament is  thus  clearly established.   Cabinet decisions  upon matters of highpolicy, which are  approved  by the Commons, are clearly the &quot; act &quot; and &quot; will &quot; ofthe  Commons,  operated by their Executive,  the  Government of the day.  It is,therefore, imperative that in  those cases where alternative work is unavailable, inspite of all efforts on the part of the  Government and the employers concerned toobtain it, full compensation shall be paid to the men and women who &quot; suffer directpecuniary loss&quot; in consequence of  the Government policy.   It should,  however, bestressed that no compensation that is likely to be paid can  fully compensate for  theloss of employment, either from a personal or a civic point of view.  The closing of a factory or shipyard with compensation to the workmen dismissed  is a severe blow tothe industrial life of a town,  militating against the opportunities of young  people to enter careers, and  if as is often the case, the yard or factory in question is  thechief source of employment for the locality, it means the swift decay of a town or district.  It is, therefore, of paramount importance, that no effort should be  sparedand no avenue unexplored to substitute  productive  employment for  work uponarmaments.  The  payment of compensation should be regarded as a last resource,after all other efforts  have failed.     15.  There are  towns  and  districts  that  have already been  very adversely affected by the preliminary  &quot;slowing up&quot; of naval construction.  These areasinclude places  like  Barrow-in-Furness,  Newcastle,   Sheffield,   as  well as   theex-dockyard towns of Rosyth and Pembroke.  Any measures of compensation  (either in the direction of employment or monetary grants) should be made retrospective insuch cases; the workmen concerned should not be penalised  because they were  amongthe first to  suffer.Finance.     16.  The amount of public money released by future measures of disarmamentobviously depends upon the  speed with which those measures become operative, andwhether  the policy  agreed  to necessitates  the scrapping  of  vessels  already in commission, or is confined to &quot;holidays,&quot; i.e., secession of building.  The  lastWashington Conference decided  (inter alia) that a &quot;naval holiday&quot; in battleshipbuilding should take place until 1931, when another International Conference wouldreview the position.  It is  now understood, however, that the  Five Power  naval conference to be held in London in January next will consider a proposal that  the&quot; holiday &quot; in battleship building should be extended until 1936.  If this is agreed to,the taxpayers of this  country will be saving an expenditure of at least  75 millions,because a moderate replacement programme would provide  for building at least two new battleships per year, and as the last  battleships constructed cost  7^ millionseach, two per year for five years would  cost this country  75 millions.     17.  The   present   Government   ordered  a  reduction  in  the   Admiraltyshipbuilding programme of two cruisers,  two submarines and  a submarine depotship.  The late House of Commons had already sanctioned  the sum of   1,790,000(Hansard, the 6th November, 1929, p. 1065) to be spent upon these vessels during thepresent financial year. This is, therefore, an immediate saving, while it is estimatedthat the ultimate saving from this reduction will be nearly  8 millions.  If, however,actual scrapping of existing vessels takes place, the saving  is considerably increasedby the reduced cost of maintenance.   Apart from the cost of repairs (which is sovariable that even an approximately accurate estimate cannot be given), the  pay ofofficers  and  crew alone, apart  from  consumable stores,  oil  fuel, &amp;c, is veryconsiderable.  The average pay of each officer and man in the Navy is about  180per year (Fleet numbers 99,800, cost of  pay   14,250,000, cost of victuals and clothing 3,873,000).  The battleships carry about 1,000 men apiece, so that the saving effected by reducing the Navy by one battleship would be  180,000 per year.
     These figures are given to indicate the financial saving of public money thatdisarmament  can secure, but it is self-evident that  savings  in  wages  (naval  or civilian) will  mean unemployment.  True saving should not mean unemployment,but  the  substitution  of  income-earning wealth for income-consuming armaments,and it seems quite clear that sufficient of the proposed  savings should be expendedupon such income-earning work as will at least counteract the economic disadvantages of disarmament and  thus  start a  new cycle of prosperity in the areas adversely affected.     18.  The proposals for alternative  work  outlined above may  not meet  therequirements  of  the  districts  and trades affected by  disarmament.   RegardingColonial Development, for example, it would appear at first sight that this would prove a source of potential  work capable  of almost indefinite expansion.  But as amatter of fact, the impression is growing that there is more eagerness in this countryto receive and to supply monetary inducements for Colonial orders than there isanxiety in the Colonies for such work to  be undertaken.  And it  may well happenthat political pressure from some quarters will  delay the  granting of adequate facilities for financing Russian trade.     19.  This raises  the question  of  the re-introduction &quot;of the  Trade FacilitiesAct.  The old Trade Facilities  Acts empowered the  Treasury to guarantee  thepayment of the interest or principal (or both) of  a loan if, after consultation withan  Advisory  Committee appointed for the purpose, they were  satisfied  that  the proceeds of the loan were to be applied towards or in connection with the carryingout of any capital undertaking, and that the application of the loan was calculated to promote employment in the United Kingdom.  The  purpose of the scheme wasto relieve unemployment by encouraging the placing of immediate orders for capitalworks through the offer of a Treasury guarantee for the loans raised to finance theworks;  the guarantee operated to reduce  the loan charges on the  money  so raised.The loans were  in  practice made by the  Insurance  Companies  or  Banks,  oroccasionally by the National Debt Commissioners, or, if the amount required it, theywere raised by public issues. It should also be  noted that, subject to the statutoryconditions being met,  it was immaterial whether the applicants were  a  government,a municipality, or a company, or whether they were in the United Kingdom, in theEmpire  or  in a foreign  country.   Guarantees were in  fact given  coveringexpenditure in this country by foreign companies  and municipalities, as well  as  bysimilar  bodies within the Empire.     20.  Applications for guarantees were made direct to the Advisory Committee,which was a  small committee of experts.  The enquiries of the  Committee were directed to ensure, inter alia, that  (a) the proposed loan was in respect of capitalexpenditure and that the expenditure would relieve unemployment;  (b) that  therewas  evidence that the scheme could  not reasonably be financed without the Treasuryguarantee, or alternatively, that  without  it there would be considerable delay  inputting the scheme into operation; (c)  that  the security offered was  adequate and provided reasonable protection to the tax-payer.  The ordinary contract under thescheme provided that, except with the written consent of the Treasury, all the plant,machinery and materials, required in  connection with  the work to be  undertaken,would be purchased in Great Britain at the lowest prices under contracts requiring the contractor to certify on his own behalf  and on behalf of the sub-contractors thatthe plant, machinery or materials supplied were wholly of British manufacture.     The original Trade Facilities Act,  passed in  November 1921, provided  forguarantees not exceeding a maximum of   25 millions;  it expired after one  year.By subsequent Acts the period in which guarantees could be  given was extended tothe  31st  March,  1927, and the  maximum raised to  75  millions,  of which 72^ millions were granted up to the expiration of the period of the scheme.     By subsequent Acts the period in which guarantees could be given was extendedto the 31st March,  1927,  and  the maximum  raised  to   75 millions,  of which 72^ millions were granted up to the expiration  of the period of the scheme.  Ofthis total, the Treasury announced that  342,000 had been lost.     21.  It is understood  that one of the objections to the  re-introduction of thescheme  is that the provision of such credits upon &quot; gilt edged &quot; terms will enablemanufacturers to postpone re-organisations and economies that are essential to thefuture welfare of British industry.   Whether such would prove to be the case or notdepends  almost entirely  upon the composition of the small Committee of Expertsappointed to  administer the grants.  If  such a Committee is  to be composed  of
bankers whose only criterion will be &quot;Is it safe&apos;&apos; \ then it is quite likely that theresults will be as  feared.  But  if the Committee consists of  men of wide businessexperience,  and if they are requested  to  insist upon  a reasonable standard of,efficiency from the Companies or trades  applying for credit facilities, then the newAct if introduced- could be  used as additional  pressure  in  the direction of re-organisation.    Another argument that has been used against the re-introduction of these credit facilities for shipbuilding is that the artificial boom thus created would eventuallygrove disastrous to the shipping and shipbuilding industries by reducing freights tosuch an extent that a  large number of vessels would be laid up and no further ordersfor new construction  would be forthcoming.  This position will be met in  part ifnot wholly by our proposals  for scrapping old tonnage referred to above.   the accelerated  destruction of these old vessels will not  only deprive foreign owners  of aseries of &quot; bargain sales &quot;  and thus force them to place  orders for new vessels, but will have a  definite tendency to modernise our mercantile marine,  and thus make it more efficient than it  is at  present.    22.  The fact that the Government  of Northern Ireland is still granting credit facilities under the Loans  Guarantee (Northern  Ireland) Act of 1922 is having an adverse effect upon our shipbuilding centres.  Some of our big shipping  Companies(those in the Kylsant Combine,  for example) have  obtained extensive credits underthe old Trade Facilities Acts and the Irish  Act.  The &quot; Shipbuilding and ShippingRecord &quot;  (the 31st October, 1929) states that the Silver Line Company has receivedguarantees interest  and  capital  for 20  years of   600,000  from   the IrishGovernment.   In  consequence their orders for  neAV vessels  are  going to  Belfastinstead of Sunderland,  the district  which this Company has patronised up to thepresent.    Taking all circumstances into consideration,  it is regarded as being of cardinalimportance  that the Trade Facilities Act should be reintroduced.Summary of Proposals.    23.  The proposals to nullify the economic consequences of  Disarmament maybe summarised as  follows :       (1.) That alternative work  of suitable  character brought forward by reason of           the recent grants for Colonial Development work should  be diverted to           the districts  hit by disarmament by a  Cabinet decision  that,  &quot; other           things  being equal,  preference  shall be given to tenders from those           districts adversely affected by disarmament.&quot;     (2.) That trade with Russia should be stimulated by the reintroduction of the           Trade Facilities Act in order to  secure as large a share as possible of the           engineering and shipbuilding orders  that could then be placed by that           country.                                                           ,     (3.) That the  sale of old British tonnage to foreign owners should be prohibited           and a technical Committee appointed by the Board of Trade to draw up           recommendations regarding  carrying out of this prohibition.  In  this           way foreign competitors would either  have to order new vessels or reduce           their business,  and  additional  supplies of  the scrap steel so urgently           needed by British steel smelters  would become available.     (4.) That any existing disabilities placed upon the Royal, Dockyards should be           removed in order that these  establishments should be free to tender for           merchant  shipbuilding upon  terms of equality with private firms.     (5.) That the Trade Facilities Act should  be reintroduced in order to allow          . credit facilities to commercial firms at low rates of interest.     (6.) That if, in spite of. all efforts to secure  suitable work, workpeople are  still           thrown out of employment by measures of disarmament, monetary com-           pensation  should be paid to  the workpeople  affected.
