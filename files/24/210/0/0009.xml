(6478- 1)  VVt.2395  125 2/30 P. St. G. 3.  REPORT  BY SIR  FRANCIS WATTS,  K.C.M.G.,  ON THE               MAURITIUS SUGAR  INDUSTRY.                               1929.  To THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE  COLONIES.  MY LORD,    I have made careful and detailed inquiry concerning  the condi-  tion of the sugar  industry  of Mauritius :  for this purpose  I  have  visited  a  large number of  plantations and  factories  and have had  access to the  books of  the  majority of the firms and  companies  engaged in the cultivation  and manufacture of sugar :  in this con-  nection the fullest facilities have been  afforded me so as to enable me to form correct opinions concerning the position of affairs and the circumstances  fundamental thereto.    For the sake of clarity I propose to state the  principal conclu- sions  at which I  have arrived in a few brief definite  statements unburdened by lengthy arguments or statistics, reserving for appro- priate annexures such arguments, statistics, or proofs  as I think it  may be desirable to put  forward to sustain these conclusions.                    Estimated Monetary Loss.   1. As the result of my enquiries I am  satisfied that  the sugar industry of the Colony, generally speaking, is carried on at a loss in  existing circumstances. That is to say, when the price of  sugar, not exceeding 99Q  polariscopic test, is around, or below,  13 per ton f.o.b.  Mauritius  and the preference  at present  (December, 1929)  granted  to Empire;  sugar is maintained.  Any diminution of the existing preference would increase the loss pro  tanto and would be  disastrous.                       Cost  of Production.  2. Careful enquiry has  been made as to  the cost of  production. It  is  generally recognized  that  the cost of production in  every country  is a variable quantity, influenced by a number of factors, and that it differs  from place to place and from time to time. As the outcome of the examination of the records of  some 21 estates, out of a total of 43, which records deal with over 57 per cent,  of the crop of 1928-29, or about 144,000 tons of sugar, the  conclusion is arrived at that the  cost  of growing, manufacturing, and patting on  board ship of a tori of Mauritius sugar is, as near  as can be calculated,   13 Is.  2d.,  or Rs.8.98 per cwt. (Us.13.75 to  1). (Mauritius sugar is  usually of a  quality polarizing in  the neigh- bourhood of 99D for raws or 99 D for whites.)  (See Annexure                              * Page  .                          Selling Price.  3. The average selling price during the current year has been, as near as can be ascertained,  12 2s. lOd. per ton f.o.b.,  or Rs.8.35per cwt.  approximately.  The difference between the selling  price, ascertained as  near as possible,  and the cost of production, alsoascertained as near  as possible, both figures  admittedly  being diffi- cult of exact estimation, is 18s. 4d., so that, broadly speaking,  thegeneral loss to the industry may be put at 20s. per ton,  or Rs.0.70per cwt., for the crop of 235,000  tons  produced.

After detailed  enquiry  and  visiting  many estates I am  satis-fied that  the cultivation  of the canes is carried  on with a high degree of skill and efficiency, that much care is devoted to the culti-vation  of the soil and to the manuring  of the crop, including  theuse of natural manures and chemical fertilizers.   The effect of thisis seen in  the fact  that on good estates  it is  the carefully-plannedcustom to grow  a Jong succession of ratoon wines,  even up to sixthor seventh, and  occasionally  more, and that  18 to 20, or  more, tonsof canes are there  commonly, one might almost  say usually,  ob-tairied  from fourth  and fifth ratoons.  These facts  are ample testi-mony to the good character of the estates&apos;  field-work.   The  workof the small cultivators is a  matter for separate consideration.  At
the same time, considerable care and  attention are being devotedto the introduction of such improvements  as appear possible,  and minor improvements are being steadily made.   In the circum-stances I do not feel  that it can be urged that there is any markedlack of care and efficiency on the part of the estates, or  that it islikely  that  such changes and improvements in field methods  canbe suggested or introduced as will substantially remedy the fman-cial difficulties  now experienced by  the industry.

The manufacture  of  sugar is carried on in 43  factories, thetotal output of which varies with the season; it has averaged about230,000 tons a year during the last five years.  The largest of these factories has an output of 15,000- tons per annum, 9 an output  of between 7,500 to 10,000 tons, 16 between 5,000 to  7,500 tons,  and17 under 5,000 tons.  The smallest factory is a privately-owned one, efficiently turningout under 2,500 tons  per annum.  These factories are, for the most part, equipped with machineryof a fairly  efficient  character,  maintained in good  order by verycapable local engineers and mechanics; a certain  amount of themachinery is new, but in some instances it is old : in  a few cases itcalls for renewal, and this would be effected if the industry were working at  a profit.  Indeed, much has been done in  this  direction :  it is authoritative-rively  stated that from 1921 to 1928 some  1,613,468 was spent on imported machinery for agricultural purposes and the manufactureof sugar, irrespective of the work done by local engineering firms.  I have enquired extensively  and  in detail concerning  the work done  by these factories and, in view of what had frequently been stated, I am surprised at its general  excellence.    The  mill  effi-ciency, generally speaking, is good; in the best factory it is 95.3 per cent., and I should place the average at about 94 per cent,  ofthe sugar in  the cane  extracted into  the.juice.   The  recovery  of sugar  from  the juice  expressed  is fairly good on the whole;  in thebest factories it averaged about  89iQ per  cent, of 98-20 sugar duringthe reaping season 1929  just closed.  Full details on these points are given in Annexure IVs.                            *  Pago  .  It  is a noteworthy fact that the factories contain quite  a large-quantity of important machinery that has been made in the Colonyby  local engineering  firms, this includes such major machinery  asheavy mills and the engines for driving them, triple and quadrupleeffect  evaporators,  vacuum pans, and  juice heaters,  together with many appliances of simpler character.  The fact that there is  the ability to make these appliances locally renders it evident that it ispossible to  maintain the  sugar machinery  of the  Colony in goodrunning order.   While some increase,  of output  would  follow  from  the wideadoption of new up-to-date machinery on an extensive scale,  it is fairly clear that  the cost of  this  machinery and  the  attendantalterations  in the methods of transport might out-weigh the advan-tages, and  that, while there are, doubtless, several instances whereamalgamation  of   factories,    coupled   with   improvements   ofmachinery,  might be  economically  advantageous, I  can see  noreason tor  advocating the erection  of  a  few large  central factories and I do not feel that  the extensive  adoption of  a cental factorysystem  would  afford great relief to the industry.   (See  Annexure V*.)                             * Pago  .                Manufacture of  High-Grade Sugar.   6. It must be conceded that  the cultivation and the manufacture of sugar have  received careful  attention for many years past  and that  a  relatively  high degree of  skill and  efficiency have  been
 attained.  It is not possible  to point to grave and obvious defects which may  be regarded as seriously contributing to  the  financial difficulties now experienced, the removal of which  might be  ex- pected  to rehabilitate  the industry.   The  manufacture of  sugar has been developed  in a  skilful manner,  the production of relatively high-grade white sugar  being aimed at; this has entailed considerable skill and care, so that  the industry  has been carried on for years  at a relatively high  level. Until the recent changes in the Customs tariff of the United  King- dom prejudicially  affected the importation  of refined and  high- grade sugars it was the custom of Mauritius to manufacture various grades  of white  and &quot; near  &quot;  white sugars having  a polariscopic test of about 99Jc.  This implied  care  and skill in manufacture. Up  to  the  year  1927 this class of  sugar constituted over 98  per cent, of the output, in 1928 it fell  to about 77  per  cent. :  at  the present  time,  1929, it  is  only about  20 per  cent, and has been maintained  at that  figure  to  supply  certain  obligations  and contracts.   The  tendency now  is  to  make   so-called  raw sugar having  a polariscopic  test  of 98J0,  the object being to  avoid exceeding  990 at  which point  higher  Customs  tariffs  are  encountered in  the United Kingdom.   These facts are referred to as an indication of the  care  and skill bestowed on manufacture.                      Assistance  Necessary.   7.  In these circumstances,  I am unable to make any suggestions in the  direction  of radical changes  that may  be  made in field or factory, such as may be expected to restore the industry to a condi- tion of financial prosperity in face  of the abnormal depression of sugar prices due to  over-production encouraged by the assistance given to  competing  producers in foreign  countries.   The cost of production of sugar in  Mauritius  is below that of all foreign  coun- tnes except  Java,  and possibly Cuba.  Without the measure of protection afforded by the present (1929) Customs  tariffs in  the  United Kingdom  and Canada, the  sugar industry  of  Mauritius  and other British Colonies  would imme- diately  collapse,  with the consequent  loss of the large amount of capita!  employed in  the growing and making of sugar, the com- plete loss of employment of all  concerned,  and the  utter ruin which  must infallibly  ensue.   Consequences  too   appalling  to contemplate.  If the  protection at present afforded is withdrawn,  it appears imperative that a  monetary  equivalent  should be forthcoming to enable  the   industry to hold but  until the  intense  struggle  for existence in  the sugar  world  is ameliorated.  I  can see  no other industry that  can take the place,of  sugar in Mauritius, though  the  ancillary prosecution of some  subsidiary  in- dustries  may be  suggested and encouraged.   The maintenance of the sugar industry  appears to be essential to the continuance of  the economic and social life of the Colony.  8. Even with the  continuation of the present tariff preferences granted by the United Kingdom  and Canada the industry cannot meet the present low prices,  and  some further means  of assistance are urgently called for.  I have given the matter the most earnest consideration and the only effective remedy  that I can suggest is a grant-in-aid to make  good the losses  that are entailed even  when strenuous efforts are made to conduct the  industry  in the best and  most economical manner  possible.                   G-rant-in-aid recommended.  9. I strongly urge that  the Imperial Government should be  in-invited to make grants-in-aid to the Colony, calculated to make good the losses which have been incurred  after all reasonable efforts havebeen made  by those engaged in  the industry.  I suggest that agrant should be made in any one year equal to the loss that may reasonably be concluded to have been sustained  in  the previous year.  Thus  the grant  for 1930 would be calculated on the lossesincurred in 1929; the loss  to be regarded as the difference betweenthe general  cost of production and  the general or average selling price.
  As  stated above, it has been found by careful investigation thatthe cost of production is in the neighbourhood of  13 per ton f .o.b.If, then, the average selling price for Mauritius raw, not exceeding99&quot; polarization is  13, or over, no grant-in-aid would be called for;but if it falls below that  amount the grant-in-aid would be based onthe difference as follows :.-   Average Selling price per ton f.o.b., Mauritius.                   Grant-in-aid per ton.       s.  d.                                         s. d.  For the present year&apos;s  crop (1929-30)  it may be taken that the selling price is about  12 per ton, while the cost of production is 13, consequently the calculated loss is   1 per ton.   As the cropwill  be some 235.000  tons,  this would entail a  grant-in-aid in1930 of about  235,000.  The grant for  1931 would be  determined by the selling price in1930, and the amount of the crop.  If  the selling  price rose to 12  10s. per ton f.o.b., the  calculated loss would  be 10s. per ton,and  the grant-in-aid, if the  crop were of the  same size as that ofthis  year, would  be  117,500; or nil  if the selling price rose to  13a ton or over.  10. It remains to be  decided how the selling price is to be deter-mined.  This might  be taken as the average  price for the seasonfor raw sugar realized  by the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate (a bodyestablished under Ordinance No. 9 of 1929).  This may readily be checked by ascertaining from such reliable firms  of  sugar brokersas Czarnikow or others the average price realized during the sameperiod for Cuban sugar of 96&quot; polarization, and from that calculat-ing  the  equivalent  value of Mauritius  sugar not  exceeding 99Qpolarization.  This is readily done by adding 4s. 6d. per cwt. to thef.o.b. price of Cuban 96Q; this being the manner in which Londonbuyers now ascertain the price to be paid for Mauritius sugar.   Theprice being ascertained for the season, all that would be necessarywould be for the Government of Mauritius, instructed by the Im-peria-1 Government, to  announce that the grant-in-aid to be paidto the sugar industry of Mauritius in the year in question will be acertain stated amount per ton of sugar produced ; amounting in theaggregate to a stated sum.  It would not appear necessary to refer the  matter to any  local  authority,  the  Governments statementbeing decisive and final.  11. The question arises as to the distribution of the grant-in-aid.After full consideration I  am of the opinion that the best course willbe  to pay  it direct  to  each  factory  in  proportion  to  the dulycertified  amount of sugar produced by the factory.   The certificatemight be signed by the Manager of the factory,  and by a Govern-ment Inspector.   There should be no real  difficulty  in ascertainingcorrectly the amount of sugar  produced, and direct payment  wouldobviate the intervention of agents and possible deductions of corn-missions, etc., or the diversion  of the grants  from the desiredchannels.  I am not apprehensive of injustice arising from the payment  ofthe grant-in-aid entirely  to the producer of sugar as distinguished from  the grower of the canes.   It would seem that when the priceof sugar is low, a condition which is necessarily presupposed, thereis a tendency here to pay a somewhat higher price  for canes thanconditions warrant.   Some factories have undoubtedly been paying a relatively high  price for canes.  This condition is  accentuated bythe keen competition for canes on the part of  the factories, few of which are supplied with canes  up to their full  capacity.  It is  tobe observed that all of the factories are attached to plantations pro-13  012 1512 1012  512  011 1511 1011  511  000000000000011112Nil 51015 0 51015 0000 -00000Manner of distributing grant-in-aid.
ducing canes and only buy  a portion, though admittedly a largeportion,  of  the canes manipulated.    A considerable quantity ofcane passes through the hands of middlemen  who buy from smallgrowers and sell to the factories.                   Conditions of grant-in-aid.  12. It would be well to attach conditions to the receipt of thesegrants : these conditions should be stated  on the form of  receiptto be signed by each recipient of a grant-in-aid.  The following conditions appear to me to be desirable :        (a) Each recipient  should undertake  to keep accounts in. a    manner approved by the Government,  and  these  accounts    should be open to confidential inspection by properly accredited    Government officers  at  any time the  Government  desires.    Recipients must also prepare proper annual balance-sheets with    profit and  loss accounts  in a manner approved by the Govern-    ment.   Specimen sheets  of  suitable forms of  accounts  are     attached.  (See Annexure VI*.)                             * Page  .       (6) It should be a condition of the grants that each recipient    factory  must set  aside, as a reserve fund, a sum equal to not    less than one per cent,  of the  average  value, as  determined    in accordance  with  paragraph  10 herein, of the  total sugar    output  of the factory  in each year, until a  total reserve fund    is built up equal to  not less than  one-third  of the  average    value,  calculated over five years,  of the  amount of sugar so    produced.       (c)  The  reserve  fund  must  be invested  in  &quot; Trustee    Securities &quot;  or other  securities approved  by  the  Government.    The reserve fund may only be expended, with the written con-    sent of the Governor  in Executive Council,  in order to meet    extraordinary expenditure consequent on circumstances arising    from calamity or disaster, or such other  circumstances as the    Governor in  Executive Council  may consider fit and proper.       (d) As it is the intention of these grants  to  make provision    for the payment of reasonable  charges  or  expenses incurred    during  the year, the extent to which these charges or expenses    have, or have not, been discharged by means of the grant-in-aid    will be  taken into account on the inspection  of the accounts by    the Government.       (e) The  recipient  should agree that the Governor may with-    hold the whole or any  portion of a grant-in-aid in the event    of it being proved to his satisfaction that the grant of a current    or of a previous  year  has been misapplied,  or  that the  condi-    tions agreed  to have not been fulfilled by the recipient.  13. In urging  these claims for relief I must point out that inascertaining the  cost of  production  no mortgage  interest has been included,  though interest on advances  for  working expenses is included where necessary.   Furthermore no interest on capital hasbeen included,  nor has there been included  any allowance for profitthat might  reasonably be  expected to accrue from the carrying on of the  business of sugar  production.   If  such  grants as  I haveadvocated are conceded, they will only serve  to keep the industryafloat  until  better times arise.                    Duration of grant-in-aid.  14. In order to afford a proper sense of  security, I trust that itwill be found possible to ensure that the grants may be continued for a period of not less than five years.  PORT LOUIS,                           FRANCIS WATTS.       MAURITIUS.  20f/i December,  1929.6478B
                        ANNEXURE I.               THE  COST  OF  PRODUCTION.  The question of the cost of production of sugar in Mauritius hasbeen examined  with considerable care  and, after a  prolongedattempt to  ascertain with  some degree of  accuracy  a generalaverage cost of the whole Island, I have arrived  at  the  conclusionthat the cost amounts, as near as can be ascertained, to  13 Is. 2d.per ton f.o.b.  or Rs.8.98 per cwt. (Rs.13.75 to  ), as  stated inparagraph  2 of the general report.  2. It is of interest to note that the question of the cost of pro-duction  of  sugar  has received  world-wide   consideration.    an american Governmental  Commission with  full  authority  carriedout a searching  investigation  into the costs  of production in thebeet-growing  States  of  America  and in  Louisiana, Cuba,  PortoRico, and Hawaii in 1923.   It was officially stated that  they were unable to arrive  at  a result from which  any conclusion of valuecould be drawn.   A further attempt was made at the instance ofthe Economic  Committee of the League of Nations by Dr. H. C.Prinsen Geerlings in 1928,  details of which appear  in the Leagueof  Nations publication  1929.  11.  20.   Sugar,  compiled by  theEconomic Committee at Geneva in 1929.  In this the difficulty of determining this  point was fully set out.  3. In undertaking this enquiry, figures were taken for the year1928-29, normal  as regards general conditions but with  a cropslightly over the  average of the  last five years.  The 1928-29 crop was some  250,000 tons, as against the average for  the  last five years of  230,000  tons; this included all the sugarmade by any factory,  whether a 99-I-0 white or 98JQ raw.  4. Owing to the fact that the estate accounts in many cases arenot kept on  strict commercial accounting lines, a certain amountof difficulty  was at first experienced in  obtaining  the necessary information of a  uniform character.  In many cases the estate  accounts are kept in good order, but in others there  is scope for  amendment and organization, and conse-quent benefit will accrue to the owners if such a course is adopted.  However, with the good will  and co-operation  of all parties tothe extent of their placing  all documents, books,  and information at my  disposal,  these deficiencies  have  been overcome  and, -byjudicious enquiries, observations, and comparisons, the figures sub-mitted  by  them  have been redrafted  on modem  and  up-to-dateaccounting lines.  5. Each factory is attached to  a plantation producing a certainamount of cane and purchasing the remainder of its requirements.  In making these calculations, account has been taken of the costof cultivating the canes, the cost of their purchase when purchased,and the cost of the manufacture of the sugar.  Such a unit is knownas an estate.  Twenty-one  factories  out of a total  of 43 have been selectedwith  a  view to  obtaining a  comprehensive range of the  various classes  and types.  In  this  selection  an attempt  has  also  beenmade to take groups of factories in various districts,  of a similargeographical or  agricultural  nature,  and  thus  obtain  a  fairlyselective list of each and all conditions of sugar growing and manu-facturing  in  the  Island.  Figures have been  worked  on  an average  mean to the extentof 57.5 per cent, of  the  total 1928-29 crop,  covering in all  some143,776,142  kilos of  sugar,  of  a  valued cost of  production ofRs.22,701,017.85 cents and  resulting, as  afore stated,  in an esti-mated cost of   13 Is. 2d. per ton f.o.b.  Averages  were taken  at  successive points  as  the data became available.  It was found that when the  following  percentages ofthe crop were  considered the  cost amounted to as follows :-Percentage                                        Cost of of Crop.

  6. Difficulties were experienced on account  of  the differences in practice and  in  the manner  in charging items which might beregarded as  capital expenditure, these sometimes being  charged to the accounts  of  a single year.  The accounts were carefully scrutinized and actuarial  adjust-ments were  made,  for -these  and  other abnormal  charges,  tobring them on  a more equitable and usually recognized  basis.  7. In assessing  the annual  expenditure of the estates  for thecost of production,  the total expenditure of  the estate  (field  andfactory) for the  year, locally known  as Faisance Valoir, has  beentaken.  This expenditure is the actual sum of money spent on the cultivation of the  canes  and the factory expenses in relation tothe sugar  made.   In addition,  general  administration  and townoffice charges have been added.  As stated in paragraph 6 above, the expenditure on capital andrenewal works of  a non-recurrent annual nature has  been appor-tioned on an actuarial basis; such expenditure is locally  known as&apos;; Extraordinary expenditure.&quot;  Interest  on Faisance Valoir advances, i.e., interest payable for money advanced from time to  time  to the planter for cultivationand factory expenses, has been included where  necessary;  so  also has interest on  advances  made  by the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate,the selling agency,  in respect  of advances made by that  body toplanters in respect of unsold sugar passed to the docks  through theSyndicate for selling, when suitable offers are made.  Interest  on mortgages  has not been included in  these  calcula-tions, as the degree to- which  the various estates  are  indebted inthis relation varies considerably,  some  being  quite  free, othersreasonably encumbered, and others heavily burdened.  No allowance  has been  made  for depreciation in the  proper sense of the term;  no  provision of this nature is made in the accounts askept by the planters and factories in Mauritius at present.  In  addition, there are  what  is known as f.o.b. charges, which include all the  charges payable  for  placing  the  sugar  from thefactory on board ship.

The  cost  of  production given in paragraph  2 of the report is based on the general cost of approximately equal  quantities ofwhites and raws.   This we  believe to be justified, for  it is  foundExport  dutyShipping    .......Cartage and weighingMarkingBrokerage f per cent.Commission
that the  extra quantity oi&apos;  raw  sugar produced from a  givenquantity of cane  is about  3 to 3.5 per  cent, more than  white,while the extra cost of making one ton of white may be taken at6s. more than 98J0 raw.  The extra value of 99 0 Mauritius so-calledwhite may be  taken at about  6A-. lid. per  ton  more  than 98J0,consequently the value of the gain  in  quantity practically off-setsthe extra cost together with the  extra value of white ; any differencebeing well within  the  range of  error encountered in making these calculations.  9. Erom such inquiries as have been  made, it seems very evidentthat the minimum cost has now been reached.  Many factories arewithholding certain  necessary repair works and  improvements inthe hopes  of  better days  coming  soon;  salaries  have been con-siderably reduced,  and in the matter of wages considerable reduc-tions have been made  amounting, it is estimated, to  an averagereduction of  13 per  cent.  Labour constitutes a large proportion of the total  expenditurebill of any sugar concern, and the present low price of production is to a great extent due to the reduction of wages.  10. Difficulties are experienced from  the fact that at the presentmany planters are unable to pay cash or settle on short-term credit for  stores purchased and  consequently  have to pay interest for an extended  credit of six months or  more;  the importers have of necessity to ask a higher price to cover  ffie interest that  they  them-selves will have to pay the  outside suppliers  for credit.  Instances are quoted of rice, selling for cash at Rs.15 per bag,selling  at Rs.15.60 on a credit sale payable after 6  months,  andeven a  difference of 90 cents has been charged between cash  and credit sales.  This is important, as rations are given in kind to agood proportion of labour, namely,  the monthly  paid staff,  and inconsequence  the price of the commodities is  affecting  the  cost ofproduction considerably.  Attempts have been made to induce theEast Indian to eat other food-stuffs such as maize, manioc, etc., butrice  is his staple food and it is difficult  to change  a nation&apos;s habits.  11. It may not be out of place here to make clear the method of financing planters in Mauritius, for the present financial stringencyis  making itself felt in that interests are high in accordance withthe indebtedness and risk attached to the business financed.  A few estates are  not encumbered in any way by mortgages- andare  financed by their  own  working capital.    Other  estates areslightly encumbered with mortgage or  other debt  and are financed by the banks or brokers, commonly known as  a Bailleur de Fonds;and  lastly there are the estates which are heavily mortgaged  andalso indebted to the Bailleur de Fonds.  The position and functions of the Bailletir de Fonds are set out inparagraphs 56  to  59 of the Report of the Mauritius Royal Corn-mission, 1909,* as follows :                         * Cd. 5185 of 1910.       &quot; 56. But besides paying high interest on the mortgage debt,     which is  of the nature of  a  fixed  charge, the great majority     of the owners have practically no working capital  and run their     estates on borrowed money.    By the  end of the hurricane     season, i.e., in  April, they have exhausted the funds derived     from the last crop and  have  to apply to  a financial agent for     assistance.  This  agent is called  in  Mauritius a Bailleur de     Fonds.  He is  often a local merchant or produce-broker, he     has generally  a  substantial amount of liquid capital of his own     as  well as good credit at one or other of the  two local banks,     and when, as usually happens, the total amount of the money     required for the estates  which he is financing exceeds his own     available  resources, he  borrows the  balance  from  the  bank,     giving his own name and that of the estate-owner as security.     The planter submits to the Bailleur de Fonds a kind of budget     for the coming  year showing what he expects to have to  pay     for interest and other fixed  charges,  wages of employes  and     labourers,  manure, rice, and  other stores, and in many cases     for household  and  personal  expenditure in fact  for  all his     anticipated outgoings during  the year.  He gives the Bailleur     de  Fonds the selling of the sugar  produced on the estate  and     the right to demand, if necessary, a  mortgage on  the  estate     for any balance which may remain owing at the close  of the     year&apos;s transactions.  The Bailleur de Fonds then becomes prac-
    tically the business  manager of  the  estate.   He supplies the-    Owner monthly with the funds required for fixed charges, wages,    etc., he buys and pays for the manure, rice, and stores required    for the  estate, and,  as  the &quot;sugar is produced, he  sells it and    credits the owner with  the amount realized.  On  all his out-    goings in respect of the estate he  debits the owner with interest    at the agreed rate, and on the other side of the account credits    him with interest at the same rate on the  sums received for    the sale of produce.  At the end of the year,  the account is    made up and the owner receives whatever balance there may be    owing to  him,  or, if the balance is a debit one,  gives the    Bailleur de Fonds security for the amount.       &quot; 57. The  charges which  the  estate-owner has to pay for    this combination  of financial  accommodation  and  business    management naturally vary  with individual  cases.  From the .    evidence  which  we  have  received,  the  usual arrangement    appears to be as follows :  The Bailleur de Fonds charges interest    in account current at bank rate,  which is usually about 10 per    cent. ; he  also charges a  commission,  which is generally 2J per    cent., on  the amount realized by the sale of the sugar.   If he    is also a produce broker, he conducts the actual sale of the  sugar    and charges  the usual  J per cent, on  the  sale price to the    seller and J Per  cent,  to  the  buyer.   If  he  is  not, he    employs a broker  to  sell the sugar and allows  him  the  J per    cent,  brokerage, charging it to the estate-owner.       &quot; 58. If the estate is not in good condition and  the owners-    affairs are involved in short, if the risks run by the Bailleur de    Fonds and the needs of  the borrower are greater than usual     the Bailleur de Fonds may charge for the loan   or 1 per cent.    above the bank rate; if, on the  other hand, the estate-owner    has money, and goes to a  Bailleur  de Fonds more for con-    venience than of necessity, the latter may conduct the business    of the estate for 1J,  1, or even J per cent, commission instead    of 2-  per  cent.       &quot; 59. This  system of  financing estates is  firmly established    in Mauritius,  though during the  last year or two a few owners    who formerly employed  it appear to  have made  successful en-    deavours to carry on their estates without having recourse to  a    Bailleur de Fonds. .  . .&quot;  It will, therefore, be  seen that the continuance  of  the presentlow prices for sugar, unless  alleviated  by  some outside assistance,will tend  to increase the  cost of production  and make the presentposition worse even to the  extent of compelling the Bailleurs deFonds to withdraw their assistance owing to accumulated arrears of interests on sums loaned.  In  some cases  already, the Bailleur de Fonds has cut his  losses and taken over the property  in settlement of the money due to him,such a course  being  the only  way open for him to recover some of&apos;the money advanced.  12. The cost of production having been ascertained, as stated, tobe about  13 Is. 2d. per ton  f.o.b., or Es.8.98 per cwt., the follow-ing table will illustrate  the  relationship  this  bears  to  the selling price  : NET LOSS BETWEEN  LONDON OFFER AND &quot;ALL-IN &quot; COST PRICE OF                            PLANTER.

THE  SELLING PRICE OF  SUGAR.  The average  selling price for  the  current year  1929-30 hasbeen  assessed  on   the  basis  of  information  supplied  by  theMauritius Sugar  Syndicate on average  offers made by the London   6478                                                 -   c
 buyers  during  the  recent,  selling  season,  July  to  December,. practically  the whole  of  the  crop having  already  been sold.   As stated  in paragraph  3 of  the general  report, this is taken  as  12 2s.  lOd.  per ton f.o.b., or, in Mauritius  currency,  Rs.8.35 per cwt.   2. The London buyer  bases his offer on  the market price  of Cuban sugar  of  96Q  polarization.  To  this  is  added  4s.  6d.  to raise  the price  to the equivalent value  of  Mauritius  sugar not exceeding 99c  polarization,  including  the share  of preferential duty on Colonial sugars.   3. The method of selling sugar in Mauritius is as follows :    Over 80 per cent, of the sugar produced belongs to  planters who are members of  a body known  as the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate, established under Ordinance No. 9 of 1929, through which they sell their sugars.  The remaining 20 per cent,  is sold by the pro- ducers  outside the Syndicate.   Sugar is sold,  mostly in cargo lots,  by the Syndicate from time to  time as suitable offers are received.   4. There are about six  local  firms who act  as buyers  and sell  to the  London buyers  on commission.    From  time to  time  these firms make offers to the Syndicate, which are accepted  or declined as the  Syndicate  decides.   These offers are subject to what is known locally as  &apos;&apos; Chamber of  Commerce  Terms.&quot;  This  means  that the  offer is so much f.o.b.,  the seller  (i.e., the planter) paying charges.  In this way the planter through the Syndicate receives the full London offer but has to pay the f.o.b.  charges shown in paragraph 7 of Annexure  I. on the  cost of  production.   The  local  firms draw a commission  of  about 1 per  cent., which is  included in the f.o.b. charges.   5. The price received  for  Mauritius sugar is governed by the price  of  Cuban-  sugars,  which  practically  represents the  world&apos;s price.   The  Syndicate, being  a planters&apos;  institution,  makes the best sales possible and  is a totally disinterested party, as no profits accrue or are charged on behalf of the agency.  Various Syndicate charges,  amounting to some  21 to 25 rupee cents per cental of sugar sold, are deducted from the  net  price given to the planter : these cover cost of management, office rent, dis- counts, and charges incidental to the running of the  Syndicate, full details of which are put in the  yearly statement of the Syndicated transactions.  6. As stated before,  in the Annexure on  the Cost of  Production (paragraph 8), the tendency now in Mauritius  is to  make nearly all  raw  sugars;  therefore  in  assessing  the selling price we  can accept as an average figure the selling price of raws as representa- tive of the selling price for Mauritius sugars.  7. It is found  that the average selling price for the current year has been  Es.8.35 per cwt. or  12 2s. lOd.  per ton, and upon this figure the general loss sustained by the  industry in the  year 1929-30is  assessed.  In  what follows,  an attempt is made to convey  to  bhe  generalreader an outline of the methods  in  vogue in regard to sugar-canecultivation in the Colony.  1. Mauritius lies within the Tropics between latitudes S. 190 50&apos;and S. 20o 35&apos;.   The cultivation  of  sugar-cane is carried on fromsea-level   up  to  elevations around  1,500  feet,  consequently  the temperature  and rainfall  vary considerably in  the cane-growingarea,  as will  be seen from the following yearly normals :  ANNEXURE III.Station.   MeantemperatureRainfallInches.  38.3  50.1  50.5  86.8 126.0 124.4Port  Louis,  sea-levelObservatory,  150  ft.Beau Bassin, 750. ft.Vacoas,  1,500 ft.   ..Alma Estate,  1,500 ft.Curepipe, 1,830 ft.  ..

  These  temperatures are very considerably  below those of Javarwith which comparison of cane production is  often  made, wherethe mean temperature is around 80o F.,  and  below  those of theWest Indian islands.  2. The Island  is  visited periodically by cyclones which oftenprove very destructive to the cane crop; Mr. M. A. Walter,  lateDirector  of  the Observatory,  estimated the annual loss from  thiscause at  an average of 4  per cent., equivalent  to about 1J millionrupees; the actual loss on occasions  being  terrific.  3. The soil is  lateritic, derived from the disintegration of thebasaltic  rock  fundamental  to  the  Island.   This lateritic soil  isunderlain in most  parts  by  an  infertile subsoil  which  appears  to possess   toxic properties.    Deep tillage  is,  therefore, inhibitedand planters take care to avoid turning up the subsoil  and mixing.it with  the  fertile  soil.  Details were given  to me of instances where attempts had been made  to  practise deep ploughing withdisastrous results; the contentions of the planters seem to be well founded  and  to be  supported  by experimental work on  the  partof the Department  of Agriculture.  The shallow fertile soil and its underlying  infertile  subsoil arevery permeable by water, so that there is  no necessity  to dig sur-face drains, except in a few  low-lying or wet situations.  4. The land is kept in very good  tilth by hand cultivation  with:the  hoe, a short-handled hoe  being used,  together with various forms of pioche, or by shallow ploughs or cultivators,  and is usuallykept very free from weeds; weeding is accomplished  to a largeextent by manual hoe work and by shallow ploughs and  cultivators.   5. In  many parts of  the Island the surface of  the  soil is coveredwith boulders of  varying  sizes,  from those a few  inches in diameterup to those  measuring several feet  across.   Where these bouldersare numerous, much labour  is expended in clearing them off theland to  be cultivated ; this work forming a regular item of expen-diture under the title  epierrage.  This may cost from 105.  to as. *much as  20 per acre and even more, and is carried  out in various ways.  In  some  instances  the stones and  boulders are piled in large heaps several feet  across; in other  cases they are placedin  long  rows, or walls, ranged at given distances apart, the canesbeing planted in  the spaces  thus cleared.   In many instances the heaps of boulders are allowed  permanently to  occupy the positions in  which they are placed; in others the walls, of stones are  pulled down each time the fields are to be replanted,  and are re-erected on what was formerly the intervening space occupied by the grow- ing canes.  The intervening land is cultivated  in  the commonly accepted manner and  planted with canes,  four or  more rows of canes occupying  each  interspace.   The frequent tillage  and  stir- ring of  the soil between the rows is found to  be very  beneficial.   6. There  are  two planting seasons recognized,  namely,  one from September to  November for  canes to be reaped  when about 12 or 14 months old, known as  petite saison  canes, and  the  other from April to November for canes to be reaped in about 18 to 24 months, known as  grande  saison canes.   As stated,   the reaping season extends from about  August  to December.   First-crop canes  are known in Mauritius as &quot; virgin &quot; or  plant canes;  subsequent  growths  are denominated    ratoons.&quot;   7. The canes are usually planted in shallow oblong holes  pre- pared by means of the  hoe, these holes being various  sizes on different  estates;  they  are  about  8  or  10  inches  deep  and 8 inches to a foot  wide, and  vary  in  length  from two feet up to several  feet, according to the locality.  In some  instances a shallow furrow  is opened with a light  plough and the cane cuttings placed therein.    It is  a common  practice to place a substantial layer of a care- fully-prepared mixture of filter-press cake and ashes at the bottom of each hole and to place the cane cuttings thereon.   The cuttings are then  lightly  covered with earth and, finally, a layer of well- prepared  farm-yard manure is placed over all  : the  quantities of manure thus applied being usually about 3  tons per  acre  of  the mixture of filter-press  cake and ashes,  and  from 3  to  5  tons of  farm-yard  manure. It  is customary to apply  chemical  fertilizers  about two and a-half or three months after planting,  various mix-  tures being used, or either  nitrate of soda or sulphate  of  ammonia.
   8. In  addition,  chemical fertilizers  are  used  extensively  botb for plant and ratoon  canes.  The following examples taken from the records of six  estates represent  the general practice :                              ESTATE  I. Plant or&apos;virgin canes.    At  planting, 50  kilos,  nitrate of soda per acre.   Six or seven months later, 100 kilos, of a mixture of sulphate of ammonia and nitrate of potash. Ratoon canes.    1st.  Ratoons:  as growth starts, 50 kilos, nitrate of soda.   Later, 150 kilos, of a mixture of  ammonium phosphate, nitrate of soda, and nitrate of potash.   2nd and all subsequent ratoons, 150 kilos,  per acre of the  last- named mixture.                            ESTATE II. Plant canes.    Three  months  after planting,  112  kilos,  nitrate of soda followed by 112 kilos, of either nitrate of soda or potash when rains set in. Ratoon canes.    All  receive 224 kilos, of nitrate of  soda.                           ESTATE III. Plant canes.    Three months  after planting,  125  kilos, of mixture of sulphate of ammonia, nitrate of soda, and nitrate of potash. Ratoon canes.    50 kilos, of above mixture, followed by a further 125 kilos, when cases  show  up.                           ESTATE IV. Plant canes.    Three  months  after planting, 90  kilos, sulphate  ammonia, 60 kilos,  nitrate of potash,  150 kilos, phosphatic guano. Ratoon canes.    40 kilos,  nitrate  of potash,  60 kilos,  sulphate  of  ammonia, 50 kilos,  phosphatic  guano.                            ESTATE V. Plant  canes.

Eeceive 150  kilos, of the same mixture.                           ESTATE VI.  &apos; Plant  canes.    Two months after planting,  56 kilos, nitrate of soda.   Eight months after planting, 100 kilos, nitrate of  soda. Ratoon canes.   All  received  112 kilos, of a  mixture containing  sulphate of ammonia 53  per cent., nitrate of potash 32 per cent., superphosphate 15 per cent.  9. Practically all  the molasses produced in the factories is  used as fertilizer for the  canes : it is  diluted with about 30 per cent, of water  and poured  into the  cane-holes  either before  planting or shortly afterwards, 3 to 4 tons per acre  being the quantity usually applied.  In some cases the molasses is mixed with fine bagasse  and then sent to the fields, while in others it is poured on the manure-heap together with water and  allowed to take part  in the fermentation of cane-tops, scum-cake,  farm-yard manure, etc.   These  mixtures are used in  planting to the extent of from  3  to  8 tons  per acre,or even more.  Generally speaking,  there is insufficient molasses to dress ratoons,but  experiments have recently been  made on  a plantation in  the north of the Island, using 6  tons of molasses on third  ratoons :
 in another instance, an attempt is-being made to give all the ratoon canes an  application of molasses to the extent of 5 to 7 tons per acre,  followed  by irrigation  water.   In other instances,  molasses is  applied to ratoon canes immediately after the  trash, or straw, has been  buried and before the chemical fertilizer is applied.   It is claimed that considerable increase in yields is obtained from the use of molasses as a fertilizer, and, as will be recognized, active efforts are being  made to  ascertain the best methods  of  applying it.  The  claims concerning the increase of yield seem to be well founded; probably the  successful use is  connected with  the peculiar nature of  the soil and  its complete aeration.   10.  As the young canes make their appearance they are moulded up either by hand or by means of light ploughs,  and this moulding is repeated from  time  to time as conditions require.   Mechanical tractors, often of the Clectrac, or similar type,  are used to haul the light ploughs and cultivators, and one is surprised at the effective manner in  which  these  are handled on land which at first sight appears to be intractably  stony.  The use of motor- tractors in cultivation  and for general  haulage has been  rendered necessary  and hastened by the occurrence of the disease known as surra,  which almost exterminated  working farm-animals such  as mules  and oxen.   In  order  to meet  the  deficiency of  transport animals, tramways  and light  railways have been  extensively intro- duced  on  all the estates.   Immediately  after the  outbreak of  surra  and  the  consequent death  of a large proportion of the mules and oxen working on  the estates,  it became necessary  to raise a  loan,  known  as   the Mechanical Transport Loan,  1903, of  185,185 at  5 per cent., re- payable in 20 years, to enable advances to be made to the estates for the purposes of installing light railways and tramways.  As  the outcome there were, in 1928,  1,507 kilometres of  rail and 222 loco- motives on the estates.  Portable rails are also  extensively used.  11.  After the plant,  or virgin, canes have been cut, the land around and between the  stools is cultivated, the old leaves, trash or straw from the  canes that have been reaped is  arranged  between the old stools;  in  many  cases it  is  placed  in furrows, and often lightly buried in them, a practice which goes far to maintain the supply of  organic  matter in the soil.  12.  Subsequently, chemical fertilizers are  applied,  the nature- and  quantity of which can be inferred from what has already been stated.  It is evident from all this  that there is  no lack of atten- tion to the question of the manuring of  the canes;  it would almost seem that in some respects  there  is a possibility  that excessive quantities, especially of  nitrogenous  fertilizers,  are employed, a point to which attention has  been drawn by the Department ofAgriculture.  It is  desirable  that the  matter should be carefully investigated both  by the planters and by the Department, for it seems  probable  that some moderate saving can be effected in  this connexion.  The Department  has already done  some  useful workin this direction.  There is one point in this connexion that it maybe well to bear in mind : the  soils of the Colony are  shallow  and very permeable to water; it  is possible that  in  seasons of  heavyrain the nitrogenous plant food may be  readily leached  away, thuscalling for heavy  applications of  fertilizer,  and  this may be  one reason  why large  quantities are used.  13. Given favourable seasons, the yield of canes per acre is high; under  very good conditions  it may reach 50 to 60 tons  per acre asvirgin, or plant, canes,  and 30 to 40 tons as ratoons.  The averageyield of plant  canes on good estates may be taken to be about 30 tons for virgin  canes and 22 tons for ratoons.

  14. It  may reasonably  be concluded  that these  records  bearadequate testimony to the general excellence of the agricultural workon  the  sugar estates : the  fact that such large  quantities of canesas 18 to 20 tons  per acre are obtained from fifth and  sixth ratoonsis ample  evidence of good work  and of the fertility of the veryshallow soils on  which the canes  are grown.  The production of ratoon canes is relatively inexpensive as corn-pared with that of plant, or virgin, canes; the cost of  their cultiva-tion is  comparatively small,  the  principal item of cost being thatof light tillage and  weeding and the provision  of the  fertilizers.In order to show  the relative cost, the following examples have beentaken, without special selection, from a certain number of estates.It will be seen that  the cost of  growing an acre of plant canes is approximately three times  that  of growing ratoons.  But for  thepractice  of  extensive ratooning  the  losses incurred  in  producingsugar in times of low prices would be much greater.  It is  estimated that out of the. cost  of growing ratoons  about25 per cent,  is expended on fertilizer.      RELATIVE COSTS OF GROWING VIRGIN AND RATOON CANES.

After the final crop of ratoons has  been reaped it is  a  fre-quent practice to grow a leguminous crop and to bury the brush asa green dressing, and in  this way the  land  is rested from  canesfor  several months; sometimes for over a year.  16. The agricultural practices in vogue result  in  returning tothe soil large quantities of organic matter, the conservation of thegreater part of the mineral matter  taken  from the soil by  the canes,the utilization  of factory waste-products,  including the  filter-presscake, the  ashes from the furnaces, and  the molasses with its con-tent of potash  and nitrogen, the ultimate  return of the leaves  andtops of the canes, either by direct burying or in the form  of fumier.All of this tends to build up and maintain the fertility of the shallowsoil on which the canes are  grown.  17. Great  attention is paid  to the  preparation of the  fumier, orfarm-yard manure.  The system consists in making great heaps ofcane  tops, leaves or trash with grass,  bush and other vegetablematter (sometimes cut up in a  chaff-cutter) in  considerable  excessof the food requirements of the cattle, and allowing this  to becomeimpregnated with the excreta  of the animals, which are  kept uponthe heaps for a short time.  The impregnated mass is removed and kept  in great fermenting heaps, maintained thoroughly moist bythe application of the drainings from the  heaps, or of water.  all this is often done under  cover, but  at  times in  the  open;  bettercontrol  is effected under  cover.  This  system,   known as  theMauritius system,  results in the production of  quantities of farm-yard  manure far in excess of that derived simply from producingthe manure from stable litter, and is now extensively employed inother countries : its adoption, which permits of the conversion oflarge quantities  of litter,  bush and vegetable matter  into valuable and well-rotted  farm-yard manure is to be commended, for it  is sound in principle and helps to off-set in no small degree the short-age of manure resulting from the increase of mechanical forms oftransport and the decrease of  the  number of  farm animals.   18...Several varieties of canes are cultivated, the principal beingWhite Tanna, which, according  to a census taken in 1925, occupied58  per cent, of the cane  area;  if  to  that  is added the  5 per cent.under Striped Tanna,  the  area then  under Tanna  varieties  was63  per cent, of the cane  crop of  the whole Island.   Some  estateshad over 90 per cent, of their cane area  planted in Tanna varieties,these canes having increased considerably  in favour in recent years.
   19. The incidence of  the  various  cane  varieties  throughout the island has been investigated by the  Department of Agriculture;  itwas found in 1925-26 to be as follows :                           Per                              Per                          Cent.

Of late, greatly increased attention  is  being  given to the question of varieties;  interest in this direction being  stimulated to a  considerable extent by  the reports of the yields obtained  from varieties in other  countries,  notably from  the Java cane P.O.J. 2878, and more especially  from the knowledge  that the best means of meeting the incidence of disease lies in the  introduction of new varieties either immune or resistant to these diseases.   Much  work has  been done by the Department of Agriculture  in obtaining promising  varieties from  other countries,  in investigating  their value and suitability for Mauritius conditions, and in  distributing them to planters.   It  should be stated that the Department is fully alive to the danger of introducing pests and  diseases when canes are  brought in from  other  countries :  the introduction  is  now limited to the  Department, which  is provided  with  quarantine green-houses in which all  newly-introduced  canes are grown for a period  to ascertain their  freedom  from disease before admitting them into general  cultivation.  21. In addition to these efforts, a  great deal has been  done  by the  Department, and in  some instances by planters  themselves, in raising new canes from seed : a large number of  new  seedling canes have  thus been introduced  to the estates, some of which are proving quite valuable : information concerning them  is freely placed at the  disposal of the planters by the  Department, and a number of trial plots  have been established in co-operation  with the  planters on different  estates throughout the  Island in order to ascertain the local suitability  of  a large  number  of  selected varieties : interest  in  new  varieties is thus  being  considerably stimulated.  22. During  recent  years,  fear  has existed  that  some  of  the leading varieties of canes  may  be suffering from the presence of disease : the former  Director  of Agriculture,  Dr. H.  Tempany, drew attention to this and to the risk involved  in dependence  on a single  variety of cane, or at least  on a very  limited number,  asis  the  case  in Mauritius.   His  remarks received a  good  deal of attention both on the  part of the planters and of the  Government,in consequence of  which the matter was submitted  for the  con- sideration and advice of the Imperial Bureau of Mycology; as the outcome, it was arranged  that  Mr.  S. F. Ashby  of  that  Bureau, who has extensive first-hand  knowledge  of cane disease, should visit the Island to inquire into  the incidence  of  diseases and  to advise  concerning them.  Prior to  this, the  officers of the  Depart- ment,  notably  the  Botanist and Mycologist, Mr.  E.  F. S. Shep- herd, had  been working on  the subject  and  had done much  to clear the air and to  pave the way for Mr. Ashby&apos;s inquiry : amongst other things, he had shown  that there were two  distinct  diseases likely to be confused  under  the name gumming disease,  namely, the  true gumming disease of Australia  and the  Australian Leaf Scald.   I understand  that Mr.  Ashby  has  confirmed  Mr. Shep- herd&apos;s  work and that of the  Department generally.
  23. Mr.  Ashby gave  an interesting address (on 11th December,1929) to the planters before leaving the Colony;  from this I gatherthat  he recognizes the  presence of  certain ,diseases  which,  ifneglected,  may be capable of doing much  harm;  he  does notappear to suggest that at the moment the industry is experiencinggrave losses  from  these, and he also appears  to  think that- theplanters, with the assistance  of  the Department  of  Agriculture,can  handle the situation without resorting  to any violent  or dis-ruptive measures;  he emphasizes the point  that  the  exercise  of careful  and continuous attention  is called for in order to preventthe  situation  from getting out of hand.  He lays great stress onthe  study of the resistance of the varieties  that are to be planted   -and the introduction of new and useful ones and, particularly,  toavoid too  great dependence on merely  one or two varieties, thejudicious  cultivation  of a reasonable number of varieties making for safety.  24. It  is  worth  noting  that,  with  the  extensive  ratooningpractised in  Mauritius, the fields are only  replanted at intervals of from seven to eight years or more;  in  these circumstances it takes a considerable time to effect the general introduction of anyvariety.  25. Incidentally I  may say that,  owing  to the vigilance  of theofficers of  the Department of Agriculture,  the  presence  of mosaicdisease on certain imported canes was recognized before they were distributed;  they were  destroyed and the  Colony saved from theintroduction of a dreaded disease.  26. It is important  to note that steps  are being taken  to put the work  of the Department on a  sound  and better footing  asregards the production of new seedling canes  and the study oftheir characters.   It is intended to reorganize  the work of  breed-ing new varieties of  canes  and  to put this  work  on a  proper scientific  basis.   To  this  end a  trained  Genetecist&apos; has beenappointed, who,  after visists to  countries  where  cane-breedingwork is being  scientifically carried  on, will  take  up work in theColony.  One of the officers of the Department, Mr. A. de Sornay,who will be associated with him in this work, has already visited the Sugar Experiment Station at Coimbatore in Southern Indiato  make himself acquainted with the technique of the work there..   A Physiological Botanist is also to form part of the special staff.Further, in  order that work in connexion with  sugar-cane investi-gations may  be placed on  a proper scientific basis, a  Soil Chemisthas already been  appointed.   In order that he may be  familiar with modern aspects&apos; of soil chemistry,  he  has spent a short time at  Rotha-msted.   Proper  provision is  to be made for the accommodation of these officers; they will co-operate  with the work of the Department of Agriculture.   When this work is well-established, Mauritius  should be in a good position to investigate the problems connected with the  growing of canes on  proper scientific  lines and  still  further strengthen its position.  A  substantial contribution towards the salaries of these officers and the cost of the investigations is being made by the Empire Marketing Board ; the  remainder of  the cost is being met by the Colony.   27.  Some  loss  arises from  the attacks of various insect  pests of the  sugar-cane.  The officers of the  Department of  Agriculture are well-informed concerning these  and the steps to be taken to control them.  There is, however,  one pest that is  quite difficult to control which occurs extensively and is  doing much  damage in certain districts; I refer  to the  beetle Phytalus  Smithi : it is  the most serious pest affecting the sugar industry of the Colony.   28. It  was  first  discovered  in  Mauritius  in  1911,  apparently having been accidentally  introduced  from  the  West  Indies or South  America;  investigations made at the time of its discovery showed that there were then about 1,000 acres infected.  In spite of the steps which  were  at once taken to  control it,  it steadily spread, until in  1929 it is estimated that some  43,700 acres  are infested,  or  about one-fourth of the laud  under  cane  cultivation. The principal infections occur in  the districts of Pamplemousses and Riviere  du Rempart,  with less intense  infection scattered widely over  the whole Island.  It is estimated that  intense infec- tion occurs  on about 2,500  acres,  and it  is  in  these  areas that serious damage is being  done.
  The work of endeavouring to control  this  pest  is  undertakenand supervised  by the  Department of Agriculture,  which has  aspecial  staff  for this purpose  consisting of the Director of Agri-culture  and  the Entomologist,  the Chief Phytalus  Officer,  withfive Assistants and two Overseers.  The adult  beetle buries itself in the  soil during the day,  emerg-ing at night to feed;  in this  stage it  is a feeble feeder  and doeslittle  harm.  The larva remains in the soil  at  the roots  of thecanes, which it attacks voraciously; where there are but  one ortwo larvae at the base of a cane-stool the damage done is but small,but where they are numerous the damage may  be  very serious,amounting at times to the  almost complete  destruction  of the crop.  29. Various methods are  adopted with a view to controlling thepest.  Advantage is taken of the habit of emergence of the adultsat night  systematically  to  collect  them by  hand;  the collectorsbring the beetles to recognized centres  where they are paid for outof the  funds officially  provided.   The  number  of  beetles  thuscollected and destroyed has been as follows :    30.  The collecting of larvae from the soil has  also been adopted recently, the following being the record of the number taken :          1926-27.........     ...     1,305,000         1927-28      ............    20,935,000         1928-29      ............    99,187,000   The official expenditure during the last  two seasons has been, in 1927-28,  6,182, of which  5,300 was  for beetles collected; and in 1928-29,  8,328, of which  6,080 was tor beetles collected.   In addition to this, quite large sums have been expended by the planters themselves apart from those derived  from  public  funds.   31.  Other methods of control have been  attempted,  including the  use of such things as carbon-bisulphide, Paris green, vaporite, kerosene, creoline,  carbolic acid, cyanogas,  cianidra, and others. They have, however, proved of but limited use.   A more important and  more  successful line of  attack  has  been  the  introduction of insects parasitic upon the larvae.   The wasp Tiphia parallela has been obtained from Barbados and established, after some consider- able difficulty, in 1916; it seems to  be  doing  good work, and  some areas appear to have been cleared of Phytalus by its means, but, as evidenced by the numbers of beetles collected, the control at present exercised is very far  from complete.  Another parasitic  was of  a  similar character, Elis  thoracica, was  introduced in 1917 and it is hoped that its activities will rein- force those of Tiphia.  32. There are other soil-grubs attacking the canes  of Mauritius,but none of them does the serious  damage caused by Phytalus.  The entomologists of the Department have done very good  workin &apos;this and  other directions.   The  successful  introduction and establishing of Typhia and Elis is  applied entomological  work ofa high order.  33. There  is   at  present  an  investigator  conducting  research work in the West  Indies  and South  America on  the control  of1911-121912-131913-141914-151915-161916-171917-181918-191919-201920-211921-221922-231923-241924-251925-261926-271927-281928-29 27,379,000 16,257,000 38,720,000 58,622,000 49,940,000 76,318,000 75,048,000 70,560,000 39,970,000 24,579,000 26,555,000 45,082,000&quot; 54,470,000 68,716,000 94,978,000118,241,000134,903,000252,613,000
 insects by means of appropriate parasites.   I refer to Dr. J. G. Meyers,  who  is  detailed for  this  duty for  several  months  at  the instance  of the  Institute of  Parasitology,  aided &quot;by  the Govern- ment through the Empire Marketing Board; amongst other things, his  investigations will  embrace the  study of  Phytalus  and  the insects parasitic  upon it; he  will thus  be  in possession of first- hand valuable information of  importance to Mauritius.   I suggest, therefore, that full information should be placed before  Dr. Meyers through appropriate  channels  concerning the incidence  of Phytalus in Mauritius and the steps taken so far to control it, and that  his advice  be asked thereon.  When his  work  in  the  West Indies is finished it would  serve a very useful purpose if arrangements could be made for him to pay  a visit to Mauritius in order  to  advise concerning Phytalus  and  similar pests.   34. The  Department of Agriculture plays an important  part in stimulating  and  maintaining  agricultural progress.   It has given much attention to matters connected  with the  sugar industry, and questions relating to methods of tilling and manuring have received continued attention and  are the subject of experiment and demon- stration.   Similarly,  much attention is given to the question of  the varieties of canes  suitable for local use; large collections of different varieties  are maintained at Experiment  Stations; and,  as already stated,  much work is in  progress in trying out new varieties in  co- operation with the planters.  The  further development of work of this nature along  modern scientific lines, including the  breeding of new canes, will, undoubtedly,  prove to be of the first importance to the sugar industry.  The extended scientific study  of the peculiar soils of the  Colony,  together  with the consequent  advice relative to methods of  handling and manuring  these  soils, cannot fail to be productive of valuable results.   35. At  the same time, the activities of  the Department in  recog- nizing the  presence  of various pests  and diseases,  studying their life histories, devising means for their eradication and  control  and bringing these to  the  notice of  planters, go far to ensure the safety of the sugar industry from the  disastrous  consequences of pests and diseases and help largely in dealing with those, such as Phytalus, which are difficult to control and require long-continued concerted action between the planters and  the  Department.   The Department has given  assistance  and useful  advice in con- nexion with the technical side of  sugar production, working in this way in  close association with the  Agricultural College.   36. The publications .of the  Department cover a  wide range of subjects of importance to the  sugar  industry,  including those  on - varieties of  sugar-cane,  on manurial  experiments,  on  the use of molasses as  a  fertilizer,  on irrigation  of  sugar-cane, on the pestsand  diseases of sugar-canes, on preparation and storage of farm- yard manure, and many others.   37. The Department is well-staffed and  well-equipped and  its attention  is directed to the fundamental agricultural questions.   Its work will, doubtless, regularly receive the attention of  the newly- created  Colonial Advisory Council of Agriculture, which will be in a  position to scrutinize its  activities and to advise  with regard to them, thus minimizing the isolation which is so  serious a matter.   The maintenance of a  sound Department of Agriculture with  its activities  developed to the  utmost and working  in close association with the planting body should  be the concern alike  of the Govern- ment and of the planting community.                            Irrigation.   38. For many years past it  has been  customary  for favourably situated estates to use water from adjacent rivers for irrigating their canes.  The water rights of the various riparian owners  are defined and  are jealously  guarded.  The  water, under  definite  regulation,is  led into small reservoirs on the  estates and from them distributed to the fields.  Considerable,, length of  small masonry  canals con-structed for  this purpose  are widely met with  about the country. Irrigation as thus practised is  not  very well controlled  and, fromcasual observation, it  would seem that a  good deal of the water iswasted; there  is no doubt, however, that this irrigation is of con- siderable  service  and  that  by its  means it is possible to carry6178F
 favourably situated canes over periods of drought  and to maintain growth when rain is deficient, though, obviously, there is the defect that the supply of  irrigation water is likely to be  smallest in dry times, just when it is most needed.   In 1911 attention was directed to the establishment of irrigation works on a large scale,  and the services of an officer having Indian experience of irrigation were  obtained  in  1913 to  advise  on the subject.  As the outcome, it was decided to construct a reservoir at La  Ferme  with a storage capacity of  415 million cubic feet  (2,594 million gallons) furnished  with 21 miles of distributing channels, estimated to furnish water to some 3,000 acres in  the Black River district, in the western part of the Island.  This  work has been completed at a cost of  Rs. 1,686,150 and water has  been available for some years.   39.  Opinion appears  to be divided as to  the  financial  success of the  scheme up to the present, and there have  been complaints of shortage of water during times of drought, but recently the quantity of water collected has been augmented  by  directing  the over-flow from Mare aux Vacoas  to La Ferme, and it is estimated that the reservoir can  be refilled three or four times a year.   Doubtless the district to be irrigated presents  some difficulties,&apos; and the fields have not  been laid  out and planted directly  with a  view to irrigation; furthermore, the users of the water have not had much experience of irrigation work,  consequently it would  seem that  a  good deal of the water has  not been  used to  the best advantage.   40. In order to help to remedy  some  of these defects, an officer -of the Department  of Agriculture, Mr. Lesur, was recently sent to Hawaii to  study  the  irrigation methods in successful use there. He has recently returned and  a number of areas  on estates have been placed under his control whereon he is demonstrating for the guidance  of planters the methods  which appear to be suitable for the districts in question.   Three such demonstration plots on estates are in operation, together  with two on fields belonging to small Indian  cultivators,  and  the establishment of  several other similar plots is in contemplation.  These plots are  being properly laid out and  planted so as to permit of  irrigation being done  in the -correct way.  It is expected that correct  methods  will result in far more economical use of the water available and will enable planters who are already doing some irrigation work to  improve  their methods very considerably.   41. A large scheme for the  irrigation of lands in  the northern part of the Island is in  process of development.   For this purpose, a  storage reservoir,  having a  capacity  of  202  million cubic feet (1,263 million gallons),  has  been constructed at La Nicoliere; this is estimated to be capable of irrigating  about 7,500  acres,  and re- cently water has become available from this source.   It is proposed to add  to the  water available from the La Nicoliere reservoir by bringing into  it the water  from Midlands  reservoir situated near the centre of the Island : this  has  a capacity of 760 million cubic feet  (4,750 million  gallons), thus  greatly  increasing  the  output.-Work has already been begun on this extension, but it is understood that the financial aspects are causing some anxiety.   It is estimated that this northern scheme,  when completed, will cost in the neigh - bourhood of  600,000.   The position at the moment is the subject of Government enquiry.   42. At present the work of irrigation may be regarded as being in the experimental stage.   It  was undoubtedly a  wise proceeding to send a local officer to acquire detailed information regarding the methods in use in Hawaii, and it is  anticipated that the Department of Agriculture, having his  services at  its disposal, will be able to help the  planters to  put into  operation more  precise and better methods  of working.  In view of the very considerable sums of money  now invested in irrigation work,  the matter is or  much importance.                        Small Cultivators.   43. The  foregoing remarks  apply  to  the  regularly-organized estates.   Of recent  years, a large area of the cane-land has passed into the hands of small cultivators, who are almost entirely East Indians;  the  area so owned has fluctuated somewhat; in 1922 it amounted to  80,150 acres,  or 46.2  of the land under cane cultiva-
tion, since then it has shown a slight tendency to fall, being 68,019acres in 1928, or 43.1 per cent, of the  total cane cultivation.  the yield of canes obtained by these small cultivators is low, and it isestimated that, while occupying 43 per cent, of the area, they onlyproduce about  25 per cent, of  the  crop.   Some East Indians  aremen of substance, holding comparatively large acreages, and manyof them work their land well, copying  closely the methods adopted on  the well-established  estates.  On the other hand,  many,  andnumerically the greater number, occupy small holdings and, beingfor the most part, without adequate capital, their methods of culti-vation are poor and their yields small, ranging from around 7 to 9tons of cane per acre.  44. There is no doubt  that when  the larger estates parted withtheir land to small cultivators there was a tendency to dispose ofthe poorer portions, so that much of the land in possession of  thesmall cultivator is below  the average fertility, and, as the methodsof cultivation are poor,  the results are necessarily low.  In  thisway the average production of sugar per acre in the Colony is  de-pressed and gives rise to the impression that the general agricultural work is poor.  I  think it is desirable  to consider the  agriculturalproblem in its two aspects, namely, the work  done by  the  well-organized estates, which, as I have endeavoured to show, is good,and the  work  of  the  small cultivator,  which is productive of  butsmall returns.  45. If it were  possible to effect  marked improvements in  theagricultural methods of the small  cultivators, the general outputof the Colony might be considerably raised, but this will be a verydifficult thing to do.   The  methods and outlook of the small EastIndian cultivator differ markedly from  those of the European culti-vator : he has little or no capital and relies largely on the co-opera-tion of all the members  of his family for performing the work inhis fields.   In  this way little money passes by way of wages :  thewhole  family lives off the small-holding.  Under such a system  themanuring of the fields is imperfect, though often some attempt ismade to prepare and apply farm-yard  manure,  but there is strongtemptation  for the small cultivator to sell such farm-yard manureas-he  can produce, instead of using it  on his own field.   In  some instances  the  better  class  of  small  cultivators  buy  chemicalfertilizers.  46.  In  fact,  amongst the East  India cultivators all grades existfrom the larger, who, being able to procure capital, work their landsvery much on the  lines adopted  on the  well-established estates,getting yields of from 15  or 20 tons of  cane per acre, or over, downto the smallest, who, having no capital, work  their land with  the aid of their families, living  a hand-to-mouth  existence and  pro-ducing often only about  7 tons of canes per acre.  Tire small cultivators often  supplement their incomes  by grow-ing other crops in addition to canes, such as food-crops or tobacco.  The best methods of improving the status of the small  cultivatorwould  appear to  lie  in  the application of  steady, well-consideredadvice brought to him by  means of instructors familiar with  hismodes of thought and outlook and  speaking  his language.   It isprobably of very little use to attempt to convey instruction to himthrough  English-speaking  instructors,  who  will either not  belistened to or not understood and whose advice will not be followed.Some  good would probably result from the establishment  of a fewdemonstration  stations  in different parts  of  the Island, wheresimple demonstrations of good  methods of  working small-holdingscould  be  demonstrated;  these would also serve as centres wherethe instructors could meet  the small cultivators regularly  and dis-cuss with them the methods of the demonstration plot and of theirsmall-holdings.  The  work of  the  demonstration plot  should bekept on  the  simplest lines  and  nothing  spectacular  should  be attempted.   It  should not be  expected  to play the  part of  an experiment station.  47. At  this  demonstration station the  officers  of  the  Depart-ment of  Agriculture in their several degrees could guide  the  ideas of the  small-holders in respect  to the financial aspects  of the work,explaining how the money coming in from the crop may be utilizedand how this may be  supplemented by  means of money obtainable
through  such  agencies  as Agricultural  Banks  and  AgriculturalCredit Societies.  Through these centres information would also be disseminatedwith regard to the best varieties of cane to cultivate and the methods to be followed  in controlling pests and diseases.  With care, patience, and sympathetic knowledge  it would seempossible to build up  an important division  of  the Department ofAgriculture devoted to the affairs of the small cultivators; a matterwell worth considering when it is  remembered  that  they  occupy43 per cent, of the area cultivated in canes in  addition to other land.  48. Agricultural  Co-Operative  Credit  Societies  are already inexistence under the control of the Department of Agriculture.   Thesystem  under  which they work was inaugurated in  1912  as the outcome of recommendations made by  the Royal Commission of1909; their work is regulated by Ordinance No.  4 of  1913  and bythe rules made thereunder.  The Director of Agriculture is the Registrar  of the societies and  is assisted by an Inspector.  49. At the end of June, 1928, there were 26  Societies  with atotal membership of 2,492, an average  of 96 per  Society.  1,507members were taking loans of an average  amount of Rs.173 perperson.   The  total amount  of loans made to  members  at  thatdate was Rs.261,227, or a mean per  Society of Rs.10,047.   Out ofthis  sum,  Rs.109,804 was overdue,  making a mean of Rs.4,223per Society.  50. The  total liabilities of  all  the  Societies  together  wereRs.292,520 (or a mean of Rs.11,251 per  Society), and the totalassets amounted to  Rs.277,479  (or a mean  of  Rs.10,672  perSociety), leaving an excess  of  assets over liabilities of Rs.15,041(or a mean of  Rs.579 per Society).  The total  Reserve  Fund of  the   Societies  stood  in 1928 atRs.171,743 and is an increase on the last year.  51. With a  view to remedying the practice which had  existedof excessive liberality with which loans had been  made, coupled with  extensions of time  for repayments of such loans, a  revisedsystem, based  on a paper  published by the  Joint Registrar of Co-operative  Credit  Societies in Ceylon, was introduced in T928-29,the result of which has yet to be reported upon.  52. It is to be hoped, however, that the changes recently intro-duced will  check abuses and render the work of the Societies more efficient and useful.  The matter seems to  be  of such importancein relation to  the small East Indian cultivator  that  one hopes itwill  be kept prominently in mind.  It is  well known that much of the success  of Societies  of this nature in Europe and many other parts of the  world has been dueto their adherence to the principle of the Raiffeisen system,  accord-ing to which   &quot;no  dividends  or distribution of  profits  is  allowed&apos;&quot; under any circumstances.   One of the  essential features  of the&apos;&apos; organization  is that individuals are to derive no  benefit except the&apos;&quot; privilege of borrowing, and every farthing which is left over out&quot; of the transaction is rigorously claimed for the reserve fund, which&quot; is  an entirely peculiar feature.  It belongs wholly to the bank and&quot; must not be shared out on any pretence.  It is really the backbone&quot; of the whole system .  .  .  .&quot;  (W. Fawcett,  imply. Dept. Agr.Pamphlet No.  35, p. 29, Agricultural Banks).  53. The  principles of the Raiffeisen system  are  not  applied tothe Mauritius  banks.  It is observed  that the members of  several of these  Societies decided to  forgo  their dividend  in  1927-28  andthus to reduce the rates of interest charged on loans, thereby supply-ing their members with funds for agricultural purposes at low rates.  In  some cases, however, the members are persistent  in regard-ing money paid  for  shares  as an  investment and are very  dis-appointed if no dividends are forthcoming.  If the principles of the Raiffeisen system can be  adopted, it wouldseem that  the  position would  be  strengthened  and some  abusesremoved.  54. It  is considered that much can be done to help the smallcultivator to improve his lanld and increase his yields if the proposed
Agricultural instructors co-operate  with the Inspector  of  the Co-Operative Credit  Societies.  As a result of the demonstration centres the peasants  will see what can be done  by expending a little money on their  land inthe way of manuring and irrigation,  and  the  resultant financialgain to themselves.   The Co-operative  Societies are there to help them,  and sound advice will be available as to how to utilize  themwith profit.                       ANNEXURE VI.

The opening balance will  be the gross profit on the working ofthe year as regards actual field and factory expenses and the saleof sugar actually made to date.  The  items  of  expenditure grouped  in this  account are  thoseusually fo\ind  in a profit and loss account, and will clearly indicate the selling and extraordinary charges, as separated from manufac-turing and cultivation charges.  Directors&apos; fees must be  shown in a lump sum representing  thetotal  remuneration for the year, in accordance  with the require-ments of the Companies Act, 1929.  The appropriation of dividends is. clearly indicated, and the itemReserve Account next bfelow  is  ithe  estate&apos;s  ordinary  reserveaccount, if any,  differentiating from the Government ConditionalReserve referred  to  below.  The sugars  to realize must be shown in weight and approximateestimated price.  The Government  Conditional Reserve  is a conditional cash  de-duction from  the  suggested Government  Grant-in-Aid,  and  isclearly shown  thus as  a deduction made from the total yearly sumgranted and not available for any other purpose than investment insome  form of Trustee security or other approved investment.  It being a  condition of the grant-in-aid  that  at least one percent,  of the average value, as determined by the conditions of the.
grant, of the total sugar output of the factory in each year, be set.aside as a Reserve Fund until a total reserve fund is built up equalto not less than one-third of the average value, calculated over fiveyears, of the amount of the sugar so produced.  By the  methodadopted in this profit and loss account only the net sum, after deducting the  compulsory  reserve,  becomes  available to  meet expenditure.  Special accounts will of necessity have  to be kept for  this re-  .serve fund as follows : 1 Government Conditional Reserve Fund ;2 Government Conditional Eeserve Fund Investment Account, and3 Interest Account.  The interests received from such investmentsbeing immediately reinvested to increase the capital sum.

                       STATEMENT D.                     BALANCE  SHEET.  The Balance Sheet is drawn up in the usual commercial account-ing manner, embodying the requirements  of the  Companies  Act,1929, and  differs somewhat  from the form at  present adopted inMauritius.   It is felt, however, that  better  security is offered to both the estate and Government if the present form D is employed.This  will not prevent the estates putting up their balance sheetsfor their shareholders in  their usual style,  should they wish tocontinue to do so, subject, of course, to the new  requirements of theCompanies Act, 1929.  However,  for uniformity and facility of  control, it is  suggestedthat the present form D may be accepted, as it  shows the financialposition in a clearer manner and  in  more  detail which is  very necessary when Government is interested as an  investor in relationto the  proposed grant-in-aid  and  the possible introduction  of  aGovernment Agricultural Bank in Mauritius.  The Liabilities  side clearly  shows the position  of the  estate inthat respect, and the Assets  side shows just  what is essentiallynecessary  for an  investor or  other interested  party to  be  made aware of.  The  Government  Conditional Reserve  Fund  Investments are clearly shown, and can therefore be easily verified.  In  Mauritius it is the practice to show their Land, Buildings,Plant, etc.  (known  locally as  &quot; Bienfonds  &quot;), in one figure whichremains fixed.   No additions or reductions being usually made.  it therefore gives  rise  to  a very unsatisfactory state as regards thevalue of the  property.  Many estates show this valuation  to be thesame as it  was when the estate was purchased some 10 to 20 yearsago.   Great fluctuations have taken place in values even during the last few years,  yet the book value of the estate is constant.   As there are only  43 estates with factories which will come underthese regulations, it is  suggested  that,  if possible, a revaluationmight be made of the lands,  buildings, plant, etc., and the accountskept as shown in the Balance Sheet under estate account  and plant and  machinery  account.   The necessary provision for depreciation should also be made andthe two accounts kept up to  date accordingly.   If  the accounts cannot  be so split  up, and there appears to beno reason why they  cannot be, then revaluation of the whole estateshould  be  made and the  requisite depreciation charged annuallyagainst the one account.   By  depreciation is understood  the gradual permanent decreasein the value of an asset  from any cause.   The  causes are twofold :1  Ordinary inherent, or  internal, such  as wear  and tear of wastingassets arising through use of working; e.g., plant,  machinery, and buildings.   2 Extraordinary  or extension^ial, such as obsolescence in thecase of machinery.   It  is obvious therefore that, unless assets are depreciated,  their value on the Balance Sheet will be overstated  and the true repre-sentation of the state of the  business will not be shown.   Assets such as plant and machinery  are held  with a view  of earning income, and any  loss which arises from wear and tear inearning such income should be charged against it.   The method in general  use in Mauritius is to charge  all repairs to revenue,  together with such heavy renewal  expenditures as areincurred from time to time.  If profits are not available for meetingthese renewal charges, they are capitalized and written  off as andwhen financial conditions  permit.   It  may therefore  be argued in Mauritius that this system meetsthe requirements of a depreciation account, seeing that they main-tain their  factories,  in some cases, in a condition as good as theoriginal.   This can hardly be admitted, for no allowance is made for  obsolescent-lescence, depreciation of  values,  or acquisition of modern plant,and,  in the circumstances  now due to the present depression in the sugar market, factories  for, the last two years  have not  been  ableto be maintained in a thoroughly efficient condition, because of lackof money, and, therefore, at  the  moment their true value is un-
known.  There  are cases where  factories  are worth  more  thanshown in the Balance Sheets,  as they were bought at  low figures and have had considerable sums expended upon them.  An important  point is the question of an auditor&apos;s certificate.  Inthe event  of  a  Government grant being made  to the sugar in-dustry, it is considered that the accounts should be certified in a manner  required under  the Companies  Act, 1929.  It would  be preferable if accounts could be  audited by duly qualified auditors,but, as the  number available is very limited, the certificate shouldbe  water-tight and binding enough to ensure a true and  correct-check being made.  There are several private companies and civil partnerships owningestates, and in the normal way the requirements of the CompaniesAct would  not  affect them.   However, if they  are  anxious for financial assistance from  Government, the concomitant  conditionsare laid down and should be accepted.^  The Balance  Sheet  and  other financial statements are  entirelyconfidential, to be retained  at  the head  office or factory and onlyopen to confidential inspection by the Government&apos;s inspector.  There does  not appear to be  any hardship or injustice in these requirements, which are only the details the parties would be calledupon  to supply  if they approached a bank manager for financialassistance.  .PORT  LOUIS.
