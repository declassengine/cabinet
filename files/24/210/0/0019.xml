THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1930.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.   33CP. 69 (30).                                 CABINET.IRAQ.INCIDENCE  OF COST OF BRITISH  COMMISSION.            Memorandum by  the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    I CIRCULATE for the information of the  Cabinet a despatch from the High Commissioner for Iraq  recommending that,  as from the beginning of the next financial year, His Majesty&apos;s Government  should accept the full cost of the British High Commissioner and  his staff.  A similar recommendation was strongly pressed by the late Sir Gilbert Clayton in a despatch which I circulated to my colleagues on the 3rd  September last (CP. 239 (29)), and the  arguments in favour of the course advocated were explained in paragraph 9 of the departmental memorandum which was circulated with Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s despatch.  These arguments were further developed in my memorandum  to the Cabinet of the 20th September (CP. 252 (29)). The conclusion reached by the Cabinet on that occasion was that, in the circumstances then existing, the question presented no urgency.   The Cabinet, however, authorised me  to raise the matter  again if it should become one &quot;of pressing importance.&quot;  I think that it can be said  that this condition has now been fulfilled.    2.  In September last,  when the Cabinet decided&quot;not to adopt this proposal, the relations between this country and Iraq, following upon the announcement of our intention to support Iraq&apos;s admission to the  League in 1932, were  excellent.   A cordial atmosphere prevailed.  The serious political impasse at Baghdad had been solved by the formation,  under the leadership of the late Abdul Muhsin Beg, of a strong and responsible Government embracing the two principal  political parties in Iraq.  There seemed then every indication that the Iraq Government  were eager to co-operate with us in the solution of outstanding questions before 1932, and that the  negotiation of the new Treaty would be carried out under favourable auspices. Consequently, need for any further concession  to  Iraq was then less evident.    3.   Since  that  date, however,  the situation  in Iraq has  deteriorated.   In November last Abdul Muhsin Beg, the Iraq Prime Minister, committed suicide.  His death would  in any case  have been a blow  to British policy  in  Iraq,  but  the circumstances attending it  made it a source of even greater embarrassment to  His Majesty&apos;s Government.  He left behind him a valedictory letter couched in somewhat ambiguous terms.  This was published in the vernacular press in a garbled form so designed as to make it appear  that the late Prime  Ministers suicide was prompted by despair and disgust  at British intransigeance.  It was represented as a sacrifice to the cause of complete  independence, and all true Iraqi patriots were invited to take inspiration  from  his example and  to redouble  their  efforts  to secure  the emancipation of Iraq and  the elimination of  British influence.   An anti-British agitation was started in the local press, and although, at the instance  of the Acting- High  Commissioner, a  true version of Abdul  Muhsin Beg&apos;s valedictory letter was subsequently published, it was then too late to counteract the false impression alreadyproduced or to check the agitation which had followed.    4.   This  agitation  has  been  further  increased  by the delay in  openingiiegotiations  for the promised  new  Treaty.  The delay has created mistrust as to
2 British intentions and has given a new handle to the extreme nationalists and anti- British elements.  In a recent despatch the High Commissioner pointed out that the atmosphere of mutual trust and goodwill which  prevailed last autumn has now been almost entirely dissipated.  The demands of the extremists for complete independence have become more insistent.   From all sides the Iraq Government are being urged to accept nothing  short  of  full independence,  and,  deprived of the moderating counsels of the late Prime Minister, they are becoming increasingly influenced by the popular clamour.     5.   In  short,  the situation  in  Iraq  to-day  is unsatisfactory, and,  unless something is done  to restore confidence and  goodwill, the new Treaty  will  be negotiated in circumstances which will not augur  well  for success.   The Treaty proposals, which I recently  circulated to the Cabinet (CP. 45 (30)), are scarcely likely  to  prove  sufficiently  attractive in  themselves  to  dispel  the  present unfavourable  atmosphere.    They  necessarily  contain  provisions  which  will not  be   altogether  welcomed by Iraq, and they will,  as a.  whole,  come  rather as  an  anti-climax  after  the last  five months of expectancy.   It seems  clear that  in the forthcoming negotiations Sir F.  Humphrys will in  any case  have a sufficiently difficult task,  and anything that the  Government can properly  do to reduce his difficulties should, I submit, be done.  An  announcement by His Majesty&apos;? Government  that they will  henceforth meet  the whole cost of the British  High Commission would, in the opinion of Sir F. Humphrys, do much to ease the politicalsituation and to strengthen his hand.     6.   The last three High Commissioners in Iraq  have, each in turn, emphasised the importance which the Iraq Government  attach to this question of  the incidence of coat1  of the British High  Commission, an importance&apos;out of aH  proportion to thesum involved.  As I  explained in my memorandum of the 20&apos;th September last (CP. 252 (29)), the present&apos;arrangement is really anomalous.  It &quot;can no longer be defended on any ground But that of economy.  Unless all our  plahs for the future ofIraq go awry, it could not in any case be continued for more than&apos;another two years.In those two years,  if we were to insist upon&apos;our pound of flesh, we could, it is true.Save some  60,000.   But we should do so at the cost of irritating Iraq  and lesseningthe prospects of a satisfactory and pasting agreement.  A settlement  of the major questions of policy  at issue with&apos; Iraq&apos; is, I submit, too important to this country tobe jeopardised for the sake of so small an economy.     I would ask- for authority  to inform P?ir F. Humphrys that his proposal  hasbeen accepted by His majesty&apos;s Government, and that he may  inform &quot;the Iraq PrimeMinister, as and when he thinks fit, that the full cost of the High Commissioner andhis staff will be borne by this country as from the 1st April, 1930.

1103(Secret.)  A.                                   The Residency. Baghdad,My Lord,                                                   January 8,  1930.    I HAVE the  honour to transmit herewith copy of a letter addressed by  thePrime  Minister  to Major Young on the 8th December, 1929,* on  the subject ofArticle XIII of the Financial Agreement, and in this connection to invite referenceto your Lordship&apos;s telegram  No.&apos; 298, dated the 8th October,  1929.t Major Young-informs me that the question was not discussed by him or raised by the Iraq Govern-ment until  the 3rd December, when the Prime Minister asked him, in the presenceof His Majesty the King, whether he thought that there would be1 any harm in  theIraq Government again raising it.  Major Young replied that his instructions from your Lordship on  this point  would preclude him in any case from expressing any opinion on the subject, and  that he  deprecated its being  raised  only  a few days before my arrival in this country.  His Majesty then expressed the opinion that itwas not for the Iraq Government to  raise the question at all.  They were bound by treaty  to contribute  to the cost of the High Commissioner and  his staff, and itappeared to him that, if any relief from this obligation were to be  suggested, it was from His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government  that the suggestion should come in  thefirst place.  The Prime Minister agreed that the contribution was a treaty obligation,but pointed but that the Iraq Government felt very strongly on the subject.   Theonly other communication in which this matter was raised took the form of a demi-official letter  from,  the  Acting Financial  Adviser  to  Major  Young,  dated  the24th November, 1929, in which he said that the Minister of Finance  was again taking up the question of  Iraq&apos;s contribution to the cost of the High Commission, and was proposing to  request the Prime Minister to address him in the matter.  He addedthat the Minister had his entire support.  In view of the instructions contained inyour Lordship&apos;s  telegram under  reference,  Major  Young  took no  action  on  this communication.    2.   There can be no  doubt that  the  dislike of  this obligation  which  was reported in paragraph 14 of the late Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s despatch Secret B, datedthe 22nd July, 1929,1 has not only suffered no diminution in the intervening period,but has in  fact been intensified.  The announcement which was authorized by HisMajesty&quot;s Government as a result of  the recommendations made in that despatch isregarded, however   incorrectly, by the  Iraq Government  as  indicating a  definitechange of policy, and anything which tends to remove the impression of subservienceand negation of  independence referred to by Sir Gilbert Clayton  will undoubtedly have a great effect  on the political situation  in this country.  I fully realise that atthe time the original treaty was negotiated there were very good reasons for suggesting that the Iraq Government should share the cost of the British High Commission.The High Commissioner and his staff Were at that time, to all intents and purposes,administering the country, and it could not have been  argued that  they were merelyrepresentatives of a foreign Power in Iraq.  Nor do&apos; I suggest that this is the positionnow, but the  progressive development of Iraq as an&quot;independent  State has, in  myopinion, reached a  point where it is legitimate to  regard&apos;the High Commission astechnically  representing His Majesty&apos;s Government,  and the fact that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have announced  their  intention to put  forward Iraq&apos;s candidature  for membership of the  League of Nations in 1932 makes it desirable that this distinction should be emphasised in  every possible way.  I foresee that the intervening period will be one of much  difficulty, and anything which will strengthen my  hand in  mydealings with the Iraq Government will be of great value.   On the other hand our refusal to comply with the Iraq Governments request would cause me considerableembarrassment at the present time. I therefore recommend  that I may be authorizedto reply  to the  Prime Minister that His  Majesty&apos;s Government  have carefully considered  his representations and have decided to meet them in  a  friendly spiritby accepting the full cost of the High Commissioner and his staff as from the 1st April,1930.    3.  I have the honour to refer in this connection to the correspondence endingwith  Mr. Amery&apos;s despatch No.  548, dated  the 17th June, 1927, $  and  moreparticularly to Sir John  Shuckburglfs letter to Sir Henry Dobbs of the 27th April,1927-H  I assume that if my recommendation is approved,and full British income-tax* No. 2999.            t No. 60 68444/29 (Secret).

consequently  becomes chargeable upon the whole of the emoluments of the HighCommissioner and his staff, the necessary revision of salaries will be  approved inorder that the officials concerned shall not suffer financially from the change.                                              I  have, &amp;c.                                                    F. II. HUMPHRYS,                                                High Commissioner for Iraq.    The Right Hon. Lord  Passfield, P.C.,             Secretary of  State  for the Colonies,               Downing Street, London,  S.W. 1.(Secret.)(No. 2999.)                        The Secretariat of the Council of Ministers.Dear Young,                                    December 8, 1929.    WHEN  the Anglo-Iraq  Treaty of  1922 was  presented  to the ConstituentAssembly of  Iraq for  ratification,  the members of that Assembly put forward  anumber of objections to the provisions of the Treaty and its subsidiary Agreements.Among these was one concerning the financial obligations imposed on Iraq in these documents.    The  majority of the Assembly was disposed not to  agree to the ratification of the Treaty and Agreements unless  they  were fundamentally amended in  theinterests  of Iraq.  Nevertheless, having regard to the situation in Mosul at thattime and to the clear promises made by Sir  Henry Dobbs  to the Assembly, in thename of  His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, that the British Government would,after the ratification of the Treaty examine at once the question of the amendment ofthe Financial and Military Agreements in a spirit of sympathy and generosity, theAssembly agreed to recommend His Majesty  to ratify the Treaty and the Protocoland the Agreements on condition that His Majesty should, after ratification, enterat once into negotiations  with the British Government in order to obtain the amend-ments proposed by the  Committee of the Assembly.    The  Treaty Committee  of  the  Constituent Assembly commented  on Article 13of the  Financial Agreement to the effect that the Iraq Government could not bear the cost  of the  Secretariat  of  the High Commissioner and his staff, because thecountry was in the utmost need of  funds in these  days of its regeneration.  In thediscussions which followed after this, in 1925 and 1928, for the amendment of theFinancial and  Military  Agreements, the Iraqi negotiators  discussed this matterand proposed that Iraq should stop sharing in this expenditure, but His BritannicMajesty&apos;s Government did not agree  to this  proposal  although they admitted thatIraq&apos;s  financial  resources were limited and  insufficient to meet all  the  necessarycalls made on them,  especially  in the matters of  order and defence.     The sharing of the expenses of the High Commission is one of the duties imposed on the  Iraq Government in the Treaty, and there is of course no intention to neglectthis obligation so long as the Treaty and its  dependent documents remain in force.Nevertheless, having regard to the urgent necessity for undertaking certain schemesof development for which the country stands in the greatest need, and to the necessityfor improving the state  of  the Army and the expansion of its  organisation;  andhaving regard  to the  promise of His  Britannic  Majesty&apos;s  Government  to  which reference has been made  in the first paragraph of this letter, the Iraq government consider  that the time has now come to re-open  this  question with His BritannicMajesty&apos;s Government with the object of examining the possibility of freeing theIraq Government from this; obligation.  I shall be most grateful if your Excellencywill be so good as to put forward this proposal to His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and will inform me of the reply which you receive from them in this regard.                                            Accept Excellency, &amp;c.                                            (Signed)      NAJI SUWAIDI.     H.E. Major H.  Young, C.M.G., D.S.O.,         Acting High  Commissioner in Iraq, Baghdad.-o
