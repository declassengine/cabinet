NO.B1!&apos;^.94  (30) .!0CABINETCOAL MINES (WASHING AND DRYING ACCOMMODATION) BILL.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     As I have to leave for Geneva at short notice and shallnot be at the meeting of the Cabinet tomorrow, Wednesdaymorning, I am accordingly circulating a note by the Secretaryfor Mines as to the Coal Mines (Washing and DryingAccommodation) Bill, which is the second of the Private MembersBills on the Order Paper for Friday, the 14th March.                                        W.G.                                      11.3.30,Board of Trade.                Note by the Secretary for Mines.     This Bill was introduced by the Labour Government in 1924.     Its object, stated in general terms, is to secure that allcollieries, where it is reasonably practicable, shall, within three years, provide their men with adequate Pithead Baths.     It may be taken for granted that, in principle, theprovision of Pithead Baths is most desirable, in the interestsboth of the men themselves and of their wives and families.Also, it is a fact that the collieries of this country are stilla long way behind other Continental coal-producing countries inthis respect.     But the situation has changed in some material respectssince 1924.   At that time the only statutory enactmentproviding for Pithead Baths was Section 77 of the Coal mines act, 1911, which was then in effect a dead letter.                             -1-
Subsequently, the Samuel Commission pronounced upon thesubject and legislation according with their recommendationswas enacted.   This is in Part III of the Mining Industry Act,1926, which augmented the Miners&apos; Welfare Fund by the creationof a Royalties Welfare Levy and imposed upon the Miners&apos;Welfare Committee the duty of providing Pithead Baths out ofthe Miners&apos; Welfare Fund.     The provision of Pithead Baths under that scheme willadmittedly take longer than it would take under the proposals contained  in this Bill.   The Welfare Committee took about two years  to complete their preliminary Investigations, butthe progress now being made is quite satisfactory and isprobably as rapid as present conditions warrant.   A good dealof &quot;education&quot; remains to be done amongst both men and owners.Moreover,  the future of many collieries is at presentuncertain, and a law to compel all pits to erect baths at thepresent time might result in much waste of money.     Therefore I suggest that the line taken by the government spokesman  in the debate should be that the Government agreesin principle with the objects of the Bill, but that the bill itself is  now unnecessary, and in any case in the present state of parliamentary business could not be given furtherfacilities.                                        B.T.                                      11.3.30.Mines Department.
