Memorandum by the, FirstCommisgioner of Works,.                  I wish to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the        urgent need for a decision being taken on the.question of        developing the Whitehall Gardens - Montagu House Site0                  In Jwief 19299 my Department was asked by the        Intent-Departmental Committee on Unemployment to put forward        schemes of work which could be undertaken in order to provide        employment,,  Among the schemes submitted was the proposal to        prooeed with the development of the above site with a view to        providing accommodation mainly for the Air Ministry^ Ministry       &apos; of Labour, Ministry of Transport^ Board of Trade^ Cabinet        Offices., Stationery Office and the Ministry of Agriculture and        Fisheries,,                  After deliberation^, the Committee decided to        postpone consideration of such large schemes until their-        possible reactions on the Government&apos;s Housing and Slum        Clearance Policy could be estimated and approved only  schemes        of work in the Royal Parks and on Ancient Monuments.,                  In july. 19295 the Committee asked a Departmental        Subcommittee^ consisting of representatives of the Treasury^        the Office of Works^ Ministry of Labour and the Lord Privy        Sealss Office to examine the proposed scheme for the erection        of Government buildings  on part of  the Montagu House  site and        also the larger  scheme  for severing  the whole site with        Government buildings  and to report  thereorio                   In Novemberg  19299 the Committee  decided  that  the        Report of  the Departmental Subcommittee  recommending  the                                                        development
(^development of  the-site should be approved in principle and  that this Department should discuss with the Treasury the  details of a development scheme0            The Chancellor of the Exchequer has now stated  that he in sot  satisfied that the expenditure is justified  on what is act  a directly remunerative work and that as the  larger  schemes  which is to be preferred both ok architectural  and economical  grounds9 would involve legislationg he  considers that  the  proposal should be deferred0            Me has asked that the question be referred back to  the Inter-departmental Committee on Unemployment for further  considerations   I mustB howeverg smpbasise that the merits  ?Jv.JL5:l!l?jr^...0* .3$J92;0P^g^t j&amp;f ,tbis site do apt depend ? in any  sen 8S&apos;9  upon its  value j as, a fad tor in stimulating or  inoreasinemplgymenj  hut solely on the vital necessity to  provide additional,  office apace in the Whitehall area to meet  the urgent requirements of the Public Servioeo  The site with  its present old  and unsatisfactory buildings is also very  much -under-developed and there dan he no justification for  any further delay in replacing these obsolete premises with  modern  office buildings which are ^ and have for some time  &quot;been urgently required to enable, the demands for centralised  Headquarters accommodation in the Whitehall are&amp;&amp; which have  been growing with increasing intensity of recent yeare? to he  properly satisfied0   The Headquarter requirements of the Air  Ministrys the Board of Trade9 the Ministries of Labourp  Transport and Health alone justify the provision of additional  spade in this area  and the extent to which overflow staffs  have been&amp; and  even now continue to be9 outhoused is without  doubt a source  of serious detriment to the central  administration  of the Public Service,,  In addition^ the  provision of permanent and modern office accommodation on  this site would enable this Department to reduce overcrowding aid
to transfer certain staff from the unsatisfactory andunsuitable accommodation in which they are now housed0          In these circumstancesp I consider It my duty toinform the Cabinet ihatg since the first discussions on tintsubject took places I have been able to make myself betteracquainted with the whole question of office accommodationthan was the oase immediately after taking Office and,, as aresuitf I am In a position to say that it is Imperative fro&quot;the point of view of economy in the use of public money^the efficient administration of the Civil Service? and the health and general well-being of the staffs concerned^ that steps should be taken immediately to put an end to thepresent arrangements by which the staffs of variousMinistries are housed under conditions which result in delainefficiency and indifferent healthc          The urgent necessity for housing the Air ministry in close proximity to the other Service Departments was strongly emphasised by the Committee of Imperial Defence as-long ago as 1923 and a partial step in this direction wastaken in 1925 when Gwydyr House in Whitehall was placed atthe disposal of the Air Minister to accommodate a portionof his higher staffj the subsequent experience of suocessivAir Ministers has only served to emphasise the extremeinconvenience of having  the Air Ministry accommodated partiin the Kingsway area and partly in Whitehall and the vital necessity to have the three Service Departments and thestaff who control them brought into the closest contactpossible! the prompt and efficient despatch of business Isstill gravely handicapped by  the present isolation of theDepartment which now more than formerly also affects the irrelations with Civil Departments such as the Colonial Officand  the Foreign Office0                                                       The,

Upon the basis of the approximate estimates which have been prepared,, theDEVELOPME3.1T under Schema G08g i0es the smaller scheme 0would result in an annual savingp after making due allowance for Interest on capitalf etoc ^ of , 9S000 whilstScheme Q070 on the same basis would save  24.000 per annum 5exclusive of site value in both cases0  The capital costs of the two -schemes are estimated to be approximately 13559(,000 and  g9215^000 respectively.,          The restriction of the development of the site tothe smaller scheme (G*8) would fail to secure the best possible development  of the site and any subsequent demands for accommodation would have to be met by  the extension toWhitehall  (coloured blue on plan) which is considered  tobe undesirable by the Royal Fins Art  Oommission0  Thissite9 it must be emphasised9 is  the only remainingundeveloped Crown site of any appreciable  size in Whitehalland a policy of  the fullest development consistent withsound planning should be aimed at from the outsets           The Royal Fine Art Commission have been consulted as to the  relative merits of full or restricted developmentof the  site  on the Embankment frontage and they havereached  the  conclusion that the  Department would be                                                  Justified
Justified in adopting the building line nearest to the embankment upon which Scheme G070 has been basedg vizs aline in continuation of the river frontage of New scotland yard,,  In considering the problem9 the Commission have borne in mind the effect as extending over a wide frontpnamely, the long distance view of the new buildings from&apos;Westminster and Waterloo Bridges and from the proposed newCharing Cross Bridge0  On the other handp the Commission^In considering the short distance view from the ThamesEmbankmentp consider that it would be undesirable to throwthe frontage as far back as was contemplated by the Act of1912 (iofo as indicated in Scheme G08) having regard to thefact that the conditions are not those of a street wherequestions of light and air would arise and that the riveritself is a wide open spade flanked by a broad thorough!are&apos;the Commission are definitely of opinion that there arearchitectural objections to adopting any intermediate lineof frontageo          There is undoubtedly an urgent need for acommencement to be made on the development of this site for official purposes but the advantages to be gained by theadoption of the larger scheme are so material that it wouldbe desirable to Incur the delay involved in obtaining thenecessary powers from Parliament for the amendment of thebuilding line laid down by the Act of 1912&amp; rather than put the smaller scheme in hand at once0  There is bound to be &amp;considerable body of influential opinion in opposition toany scheme involving building over the garden space on the embankment frontagep but ihisj, I considerp must be facedoI recommendp thereforeg that steps should be taken tointroduce at the earliest opportunity in the next Session ofParliament a Bill to amend the building line laid down in                                                           the
