  THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC M^JESTY^S government:HRIN^31ST,                          CABINET,      4          Government Representation at  the International                        Railway Congress.CR3T.P.?3(JO)*     Memorandum by the Minister  of Transport.         Copy Hp,                  The forthcoming Congress of  the International         Association of Railway Congresses is planned  to take place at         Madrid  in May next.   I have been considering the desirability         of  including in the Government delegation  to  this Congress a         representative cr representatives of railway  employees.                  The Association is composed primarily of, and financed         by,  railway administrations, both publicly and privately owned.         In  addition, the Governments of the principal countries in         Europe  and America also belong to it.   Its object is  to         facilitate the progress and development of railways by the         holding of periodical congresses and by means of publications.                  The British Government-is entitled to send 10 delegates         to  the  Congress.   In the case of previous congresses  held         abroad  the practice has been to choose these  delegates almost         entirely from the ranks of Government officials, and to send         substantially less than the full number of delegates which         could be sent under the Rules.                  The Congress has no administrative or even advisory         functions, and its utility is  limited  to  such advantages as         follow  from the interchange of views and the  association of         persons in different countries engaged in  similar branches of         work.   The papers and discussions are published.   In these         circumstances, the time and expense involved  in sending a full         delegation could hardly be justified.   These considerations         cannot  be overlooked in connection with the consideration of any         proposal to enlarge the British delegation b5&apos; including         representatives of railway labour or  of other interests which         might alter the balance of the delegation  and make it  necessary         to  onlarge it further in order to restore  the balance.
         All three Railway Unions have pressed- roe to Include  arepresentative of railway labour in the British delegation andthe tv/o smaller Unions (the Railway Clerks&apos;  Association and the associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen) havestrongly pressed their own special claims.   No appointments  ofthis kind have been made heretofore &quot;by any of the Governmentsconcerned, hut although the Rules of the Association are not altogether clear, in the opinion of the General Secretary ofthe Association, Governments are at liberty to make such appointments if they so desire, and on this occasion theFrench Government intend to send to the Congress somerepresentatives of the staff, selected, however, from employees who are members of the Railway Consultative Committee, whichis a large administrative body composed of former Ministers ofPublic Works and representatives of various interests includingWorkers&apos; Organisations.         Apart from the difficulty that Railway Companies may perhaps be precluded by the Rules of the Association fromappointing as delegates persons who are not in their permanent employment and in these circumstances could not appoint asdelegates prominent Trade Union officials, it would, I think,be desirable that any representation of railway workers at theCongress should be obtained by the inclusion of suchrepresentatives by Railway Companies amongst their owndelegates.   I have intimated to the Companies informally thatI should like them to consider the desirability of proceedingaccordingly.   It has, however, never been their practice toappoint as delegates subordinate officials, and I gather thaton various grounds, including the difficulty of making a selection if  they were to look outside the ranks of their highe-rofficials in making these appointments, and the doubt whetherthe unprecedented appointment of any such representative, ifmade, would be regarded as correct by foreign members  of theCongress, they are reluctant to take this step.
2jfc.2.1930                      - 3 -         It should be mentioned that at the last Congress in1925, which was held in London, to which the British Governmsnt,as hosts, had the right of appointing a large number of delegates, various persons representing important organisations of various kinds were appointed as Government delegates.Amongst these delegates was Mr. Gosling but he was no doubtappointed rather as an ex-Minister of Transport than arepresentative of labour.   In any case I do not think thatthe composition of the British delegation at the LondonCongress can in these or other respects be taken as a precedent.         On the general principle, I favour the representationof the workars at the Congress.   It is, in my view, of importance that we should encourage the Unions in the technique of their industries as well as wages, hours, etc.         In the circumstances explained above I have come tothe conclusion that if labour is to be represented as such onthe British delegation to the Congress, its representation musfbe limited to a single delegate.   It cannot be overlookedthat the appointment of a representative of any particularRailway Union might make the other two Unions discontented.I propose if the Railway Companies maintain  their present attitude to ask the three Unions (l) to agree on a delegate,or (2) to leave the decision to me and abide by the result.As other departments might, at some time, be involved  on thepoint of principle, I should like  to ascertain the general view of my colleagues as to whether or not railway labour should be represented on the British delegation.
