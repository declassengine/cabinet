&apos; 8&quot;- jri. i JS&quot;5 b&quot;jjjis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Government)   E C RET.CP.96  (30)      CABINETSHOPS (HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT)BILL                      Memorandum by the Home Secretary.      I should like to obtain the approval of my colleagues to the line which I propose the Government should take in regard to the Shops (Hours of Employment) Bill which is down for Second Reading on Friday, March 21st.      Briefly, the Bill establishes a 48 hour week but employees over IB years of age may be employed overtime for a total of sixty hours in any year and twenty in any month.  Overtime so worked must be paid for after the first quarter of an hour at one and a half times the normal rates  The Bill is not limited to shop assistants as defined in the Shops Acts, but extends to various other classes of employees  connected(with shops - e.g. all persons wholly or mainly employed in the delivery of goods or in any clerical capacity.  Further, it proposes to include wholesale establishments within its scope. .      I do not think it is necessary to burden my colleagues with a                                        iIdetailed criticism of the proposals in the Bill since the attitude of the Government to the principle of legislation of this nature and on this subject has in effect already been settled by the decisions of the Cabinet in regard to the reply made to the Questionnaire of theJI.L.0. on hours of Salaried Employees.  The Cabinet at their meetingIon December llth (Cabinet 52 (29) Conclusion 5) approved the following[recommendations of the Hours of Employment Bill Committee:&quot;      (l) That the International Labour Office should be informed,            in reply to the Questionnaire, that the Government do not            think it practicable at the present time to go further            than a recommendation to the effect that the States            Members should undertake an inquiry into the conditions            of employment in the distributive trades.      (2) That the Government should not contemplate any further            undertaking in regard to the regulation of hours of            employment in the United Kingdom until the Hours Bill            has been passed and some experience of its working and            effects in industry has been obtained.
      The I.L.O. were subsequently informed as in (l)  above anda full statement of the Government position was also sent to theGeneral Council of the Trade Union Congress, with whom the question had previously been under discussion.   The--view of the Government,particularly in its bearing on the distributive trades, was indicated in that statement in the following terms     ,......The Government is convinced that the most fruitful      result at this stage would be the adoption of a recommendation      leading to inquiry into conditions in the distributive trades      with an understanding that, as soon as the inquiry had      proceeded sufficiently far, the subject should be put down      once more on the Agenda.   A secondary result of this would      be a stimulation of trade union effort abroad.      It is quite clear I think that we cannot give positiveapproval to the introduction now of a Bill of this kind and i suggest that in the course of the Second Reading Debate theGovernment should express sympathy and a desire that the conditionsof employment of shop assistants should be dealt with and should offer to institute as soon as practicable an inquiry into theconditions of employment in the distributive trades.      As Parliamentary time is already heavily mortgaged, theGovernment could not, I imagine, undertake to provide time even if.the Bill were read a second time and I much hope, therefore, thatthe promoters would aocept an offer of this kind,.      In the event of their doing so I would like to see theGovernment left free to fix their own time for the commencement ofthe Inquiry.   Investigation should not in any oase be started until.after the meeting of the International Labour Conference this year at  which the question of the hourB of Salaried Employees will ssomelip for discussion and I should myself prefer its postponement to an even later date.   The questions for inquiry will be similar in kind to many dealt with in the Factories Bill and if a comprehensive review of the hours and conditions of labour in the distributive
trades is undertaken before the Factories Bill  has  seen thelight of Parliamentary day, suspicion in regard to  that bill will be increased and my difficulties consequently  aggravated.      If the Bill does obtain a Second Reading  we should inpursuance of our declared policy ask for it to  be referred toa Select Committee of the House of  Commons.     *                                  J .
