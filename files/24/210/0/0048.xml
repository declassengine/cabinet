THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.     uOJ                    Printed for the  Cabinet.  March 1930.SECRET.                                                     Copy  No.  OaCP. 98 (30).CABINET.THE  COLONIAL  SUGAR  INDUSTRY:  PROPOSED  STATEMENT  OF         THE  POLICY  OF  HIS MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT.           MEMORANDUM BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    THE  Reports on the Sugar Situation  in the West Indies and  Mauritius will(in accordance, with the decision of the Cabinet on the 12th March) be publishedabout the 24th March.  It seems desirable  that an announcement of policy shouldbe made immediately after publication.  I submit the annexed memorandum (as tothe exact terms of which I am consulting the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the FirstLord of the Admiralty  and the Minister of Agriculture) to indicate the kind  of statement that seems to me to be required.    Such a statement could be made either (a) by simple publication in the Press;(b) by laying a White Paper; or (c)  by answer to a prearranged question in  theHouse of Commons (perhaps also in  the House of Lords).  I am inclined  to thinkthat the White Paper may be the best medium.    In view of the urgency of the matter, I hope that it may prove possible  for adecision to be reached  on this matter at  the  next  meeting of the  Cabinet,  onthe 19th March.                                                                         P.    Colonial Office, Downing Street,  S.W. 1.             17th  March,  1930 ._____     STATEMENT OF POLICY IN REGARD TO THE WEST INDIAN AND MAURITIUS                               SUGAR  REPORTS.    THE West Indian Sugar Commissioners summarized their recommendations  Rage 123 offor general assistance to the industry as follows :                                Report.    1. His Majesty&apos;s Government should make a resolute endeavour  to eliminate,in concert with other Powers, the disturbing factors of high tariffs and subsidies.    para. 44.    2. Meanwhile, a single purchasing agency should be set up to purchase all sugarfor the United Kingdom,  buying Imperial sugar at  15 per  ton c.i.f., and othersugar at the market price.                                                        ParaB&apos; 49    3. By way of  an immediate moratorium,  the  British preference on Imperial  sugar should be raised as quickly as possible to 4.s. 8d. per cwt.                     Para. 53.    4. Pending  the conclusion  of  an  international agreement  as  in 1,  or  theestablishment of a single purchasing agency as in 2, the duty on sugar should not bereduced below 4s. Sd., under which tariff Imperial sugar would  be admitted  freeprovided the total price obtained does not exceed  15.                             Para. 54.    As  a condition of the  assistance  recommended, the  Colonial  governments should take effective action to prevent the sale of foreign sugar  in the Colonies at less than the f .o.b. price of Imperial sugar.                                        Para 60    They also made certain  recommendations for further scientific  research,  for improvement and better organisation of cultivation, transport and manufacture, andfor the development of alternative industries and the promotion of peasant settlement and co-operation.    In his report on  the sugar  industry of Mauritius,  Sir  Francis Watts  recom-  page7ofmended that for at least five years a grant should be made by  His Majesty&apos;s Govern-  Report.ment equal to the  difference between the general cost of production,  estimated at      [20783]
 13  a ton,  and  the  general  or average selling  price.   Sir  Francis Watts  also indicated certain lines of research and improvements in cultivation and manufacture.    As regards the first  of these recommendations, it is obvious that no early resultcan be expected from  any action that may be set on foot, but His  Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment will consider what steps they can usefully take in this matter.    In so far as the proposals in the third and fourth recommendations involve theBritish import duty on sugar, it is impossible in any way to anticipate the budget statement, but it may be observed that on the 9th of July last the Chancellor of theExchequer stated in the House of Commons that the Government would  not deal withthe difficulties of the  sugar industry by way of preference, but  that so  long as therewas a duty on sugar the preferences would be maintained.    An Import Board with a guaranteed price of  15, as recommended by the west indian Commission and the  grant proposed by Sir Francis Watts, would both ineffect require the community  in  the United Kingdom to contribute some millions of pounds a year to  the sugar industries in  the Colonies concerned.   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are not prepared to ask Parliament to impose on the community a burdenof this magnitude.    His  Majesty&apos;s Government  have already shown their sympathy with the sugarproducers in the Colonies by the offer which they have made to associate themselves with the  Colonial Governments in bearing a portion of any loss  that may be incurred in financing the  cultivation  of the coming crop.   All possibilities of  scientific research  are being actively investigated and will continue to receive earnest attention.Other detailed suggestions for improvements in the industry will  be sympatheticallyconsidered,  and,  in  particular,  the Government will be prepared  to examine, inconsultation with the Governments of the Colonies concerned, how far any, or all, ofthe measures indicated can be assisted under the Colonial Development Act.
