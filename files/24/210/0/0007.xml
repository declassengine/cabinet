  THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITAITEIC MAJESTY1 S  CPVTSRKKEKT.SECRET.^--                       CABINET.CP.57 ( 50).                                             COPY NO.         Position of the Sugar Industry at Home         _and in the Co Ion lea ._Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries .          1.  The memorandum of the Secretary of State for theColonies (Paper CP.40 (30)), covering the Report of the west indian Sugar Commission, draws attention to the grave situation of the British sugar-producing Colonies ari3ing out of theworld-wide depression in sugar.  He deals with the serious consequences that will ensue If the present conditions continue and he warns us of the disastrous results that may be expectedif the preference were removed.          2.  My colleagues will appreciate that, in view ofthe substantial progress which is being made in the establishmentof a beet-sugar industry in the country, we also have a sugarproblem at home.  The depressed state of the sugar market hasbeen felt by our beet factories to  the extent of 7/- per cwt. of sugar (equal to 2l/6d. per ton of beet of 15-gyfc sugar content)since 1927, when they made the present bargain In regard to beetprices with the National Farmers&apos; Union.  This loss has hadto be borne by the factories.  The  bargain covers the beet tobe sown this Spring, but a new bargain will have to be concludedthis year to provide for beet prices in  1931-3 because of nextyear&apos;s fall in the rate of subsidy  to Its last and final stage.The total decline in the price of sugar  since  1924 has amountedto no less  than 11/6d.  per cwt. and this has proved a  verydisturbing  factor In the development of  the  sugar industryIn this country.          3.  Taking first the question  of preference, my-colleagues  may remember that when we proposed  the subsidy scheme in 1924,  the industry was  receiving a preference of l/ll-gd.
per cwt. of sugar.  This preference was increased  in 1925 to4/3-g-d. per cwt.,  and was taken into consideration  by the  beetfactories in 1927 when prices were agreed with the farmers.   Ifthis advantage were now removed,  further heavy losses wouldbe incurred by the factories on their beet contracts for  thecurrent year.  It is true that the preferential rate was increased in 1928 from 4/3-gd. to 5/lOd. per cwt. for whitesugar (ex 99Q), but the increase was offset by a coincidentreduction of 2/4d. per cwt. in the price of sugar, this beingpart of the 7/- fall referred to above.          4.  The fall in subsidy next year will be from 13/-to 6/6d. per cwt. of sugar, which is equal to about 20/- perton of beet.  If the Customs Duties and preference remain unchanged, the factories and the growers would probably sharethis  fall equally, so that beet prices will drop  from 46/-  to36/- per ton of beet of standard sugar content.          5.  The present-&quot;price of beet on the Continent is  about30/- per ton, so that we shall already be nearing  the Continentallevel of beet prices, although the industry has only been inexistence in this country for a few years, and our farmers,besides having to face higher costs of production, have not  yet in general had sufficient experience to enable them to reach the average Continental standards of yield and sugar content intheir beet, both of which factors are to a considerable extentdetermined by skill In methods of cultivation.          6.  I foresee great pressure being put upon theGovernment this summer to mitigate in some degree  this heavy fallin beet prices.   If the Cabinet were prepared to agree to therecommendation of the West  Indian Commission for an additionalpreference on raw sugar equivalent to l/2d. per owt. far whitesugar,  it would enable  the  factories in this country to offer abasic price of about 39/- per ton of beet which might enable                             2.
them to negotiate the new contract with the national farmers&apos; Union promptly and without friction, and so avoidan appeal to the Government for an amendment of the SubsidyAct.          7.  The last fall in the subsidy in 1927 was followed by the considerable reduction in the beetacreage of 47,000 acres.  Without some means of lesseningfor the farmers their share of the admittedly severe cut in the subsidy, there will probably be a still largerreduction in the beet acreage in 1931 - possibly as muchas 100,000 acres.  This would lead to a reduction inemployment on beet growing  farms and in the sugarfactories which it is most desirable to avoid.          8.  I appreciate that my colleagues may decide to assist the West Indian Colonies by other means, and while should welcome the increased preference proposed by theWest Indian Commission,  my main object is to impress uponmy colleagues the very great Importance of at least maintaining the existing preference which the home-grown sugar industryenjoys if the industry is to survive and the nation Is toobtain any lasting benefit from the millions of pounds whichwe have devoted to the establishment of the industry Inthis country.          9.  I understand that the retail cost  of sugar tothe consumer in the United Kingdom, including the import duty, is cheaper than in any other country in the worldexcept Switzerland and Belgium, and much as I sympathise withour aim of the &quot;free breakfast table,&quot; I hope my colleagues will agree that we should defer endeavouring to bring thi3into effect so far as sugar Is concerned,at least for twoor three years, until we have seen the effect of theforthcoming drop In the sugar subsidy.
          10.  The recent remarkable extension of sugar beetcultivation In  England and Wales is a measure of its extreme importance to arable farmers a.3 a cash-producing crop at a timewhen the returns from other cash crops - wheat and potatoes - havshrunk alarmingly and I -am convinced that it would be a soundmove politically, as well as most helpful to the farming industry,if the Government, in allaying the anxieties of the Colonialsugar producers, adopted a course which at the same time,forestalled inevitable difficulties at home.                                               N.B.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,     10, Whitehall Place,19th February, 1930.
