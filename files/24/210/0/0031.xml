DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.1.   The question of applying unemployment insurance to  agriculture is one in regard to which we have been pressed a good deal by our supporters, both by way of resolutions and deputations and byquestions in th* House.   It is necessary to come to a decisions with regard to the line that we are to take, and if we are togive satisfaction to our supporters we must take a line which willat least give earnest of an intention to tackle the problemseriously without too much delay.2.   The point came up Frtien the Unemployment Insurance Bill wasbeing prepared last autumn.   The Cabinet then decided that itshould not be dealt with in that Bill, but that it should be examined further by the Ministers more directly concerned,namely, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister ofAgriculture, the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Labour.3.   The question has been examined Departmentally and there hasbeen discussion between, the Ministers above mentioned.   Theconclusion we have reached is that the next step should be toissue to the representatives of employers and employed in theindustry a memorandum setting out as a basis for discussion the heads of a proposed scheme.   A draft of the memorandum proposed for this purpose is attached.40   In connection with these proposals I should like to directattention to the following points  (a)  Owing to the proposals made in 1926 by a Committee underCABINET.COPY NOUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR AGRICULTURE.30).Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.the chairmanship of Sir HenryRew, the Trade Unions have                     /been
been led. to believe that an &quot;aneiiploymeirt insurance &quot;&apos;scheme for agriculture can be financed for a totalweekly contribution of about 6d., of which it isproposed that one-half should be paid by the Exchequer,and the other half by employer and worker in equal partsof lid. each.   There is very little evidence as to theamount of unemployment to be anticipated in agriculture,but according to the best expert advice available itwould be most unsafe to assume a lower average ofunemployment than 5%, and this means a much highercontribution than that proposed by the Rew Committee.Moreover, it should be out of the question for theExchequer, which pays one^third of the total contributionunder the main unemployment insurance scheme, to pay anydifferent proportion under a scheme for agriculture, butthe danger that the industry would&apos;press strongly ferspecial treatment must not be overlooked.The rate of benefit proposed (men) is 12s. with 6s. for a wife and 2s. for each dependent child.   This amounts to24s. for a man, wife and three children.   The rates formen under the main unemployment insurance scheme are 17s.with 9s. (under the new Act) for a wife and 2$ for eachdependent child, or 32s. for a man, wife and threechildren.   Vfe think  that, having regard to the rulingrates of xTages in agriculture which are not more thansomething in the neighbourhood of 30s. in England and Wale(somewhat higher in Scotland), the rates of benefit shouldnot be higher than those proposed.   As will be seen frtmthe enclosed memorandum, the contribution required for                                                 /these
                       I &apos;   3.       these rates of benefit is ICid. in all,  of which 3id^       would be paid by empleyers and 3^d. by the worker.   This       is certainly as much as the industry could be called upon to       pay in contributions, and of course a higher rate of       benefit would require correspondingly higher rates &apos;of       contributions.5.   It will be observed that the proposal is not to have  aseparata scheme for agriculture, but to link it up with the mainunemployment insurance scheme, although with different rates  ofcontributions and benefit.&apos;   This will be administrativelydifficult, but in spite of this I feel that it would be settinga most dangerous precedent to have a separate scheme for agriculture and that we must, therefore, face this difficulty.6.   I should mention that the Secretary m  State for scotland has pressed for a higher rate of benefit (coupled, of course,with correspondingly higher rates of contributions), owing tothe higher rates of wages amongst agricultural workers inScotland.   I feel, however, that a higher rate of benefit wouldnot be possible in England and Wales, and that there cannot bea different rate for Scotland, and therefore the only possible solution seems to be to apply the lower rate to Scotland also.7c   I need hardly say that in preparing our proposals, wo havenot overlooked the probability that the industry will regard the rates of contribution which WQ propose as very high, and  we&quot;appreciate also the difficulty of proposing a lower rate ofbenefit for agriculture than that applying under the generaleoheme,,   I have ftr^-lain^d the reasons for both these proposals and would culy say here -&quot;that the idea which..the Trade Unions                                                       -/now
now entertain as to the financial possibilities are quitebeside the mark, and that it is really necessary to bring them up against realities if there is to he any serious chanceof proceeding with a scheme.   Even as the proposals(stand,  theamount of contribution for each shilling of benefit would  bevery much lower for agriculture than it is under tha generalscheme, under which, in the case of men, the total contributionweekly amounts to 22-^do8.-  If the proposed scheme were adopted, the total contribu-tions annually would be In the neighbourhood of  2,000^000 ofwhich ene-third would be paid by the Exchequer. &quot;  This may not seem to be a very large sum, hut it would represent quite  aserious burden upon agriculture in its present condition.    TheChancellor of the Exchequer also asks me to remind the Cabinetnot to overlook the psychological effect likely to be  produced on industry in general by a proposal which would indubitablybe represented aB yet another &quot;dole&quot;.

                      MBMORANDIJM.          UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR AGRICULTURE.     The following summary of proposals for an unemploymentinsurance scheme for agriculture has been prepared as  a basis for discussion with the industry.(1)  The scheme would be regarded as experimental  and  subject     to review in the light of experience after it had been  in     operation for a sufficient period.(2)  The Ministry of Labour,  as the  Department responsible under     existing legislation for Unemployment Insurance,  \would    be     charged with the administration of this extension of     Unemployment Insurance..    It would probably he necessary, in     addition to utilising the machinery of the Employment     Exchanges and Branch Employment Offices,  to appoint a local     part-time representative in msst of the larger villages and     agricultural districts,  and also to make  use  of existing     organisations, e.g.. County Wages Committees,  as advisory     bodies.(3)  The Scheme would cover generally all persons  employed in     agriculture, including horticulture and forestry, but with     a proviso that persons who would normally pay less than a     prescribed minimum number of contributions should not be     covered, the aim being to confine the Scheme  to those who     are substantially agricultural  workers.(4)  The weekly rates of benefit for men would be  12/-, with 6/-     foryadult dependant and 2/- for each young dependant child,     with corresponding rates for women, boys  and  girls.  These     rates of benefit would require  a total weekly contribution     (for men) of 10M. on the basis of 5% unemployment, which
is the least that can safely be assumed;   correspondingrates of contributions would be paid for  women,  boys and girls.   Of the total contribution of 10jd,  the  exchequer would pay one-third, the employer one-third,  and the employed person one-third.            &quot;           &apos;  .The Contribution stated above is on the basis that benefit would be payable under the conditions of  the  existing Acts.If other conditions were applied to agriculture, thiswould doubtless affect the contribution.The Scheme would be worked as part of the general scheme(subject to any special conditions that might be embodied in it) and the provisions of the general  scheme  relatingto the payment of contributions and the receipt  of benefit would in general be applicable to agriculture.   Thiswould involve, amongst other things, the  obtaining ofunemployment books from Local Offices by agricultural workers, the stamping of these books by agriculturalemployers on behalf of employers and workers (the employersubsequently deducting the worker&apos;s share from his wages)and the attendance of the worker at a Local Office for thepurpose of claiming and receiving benefit and for thepurpose of proving unemployment.   The Local Offices forthese purposes would probably include in addition to theEmployment Exchanges and Branch Employment Offices of theMinistry of Labour, the offices of local  part-timerepresentatives referred to in paragraph (2)  above.                                                  /(7)
Special provisions would be needed to deal with thebenefit of persons wbo work partly in agriculture andpartly in ordinary industry.Contributions would be payable by the industry for sixmonths before any benefit is paid;  that is to say,contributions would be payable from the inception of thescheme and benefit Fvould only commence six months afterthe inception of the scheme, following the principle ofthe 1911 Act.   In view of the general tendency forunemployment in the industry to be mare severe duringthe winter months probably the best arrangement would befor the scheme to be brought into operation in the Spring,so that benefit might become available during the followingwinter.
