Joint Memorandum &quot;by  the  Secretary  of State        i -                for Foreign Affairs  and  the First                     Commissioner of Works.            1.    The  Cabinet  at  their last meeting asked for further&apos;&apos;       information in regard  to  the  proposal  to take a long lease       of Charitonenko  House,  paying a premium of  20,000 for       possession, and  also to retain the existing house for surplus       staff.            2,    It has proved impossible to  devise a plan which Will       accommodate the  whole  of the Mission in Charitonenko House.       There are a number of large and handsome reception rooms, and       if all the staff are to be accommodated in the house  these       will have to be partitioned up,  completely spoiling  the  value       of the house for entertainment purposes.            3.   On the assumption,  therefore, that  the  Hodgson House       will have to be retained as a supplement to  the  Charitonenko       House, rough plans have been  prepared  showing a  possible       allocation of rooms for  the Ambassador  and the Chancery, and       for  residential accommodation for the  staff.   A schedule is       annexed  showing the amount of accommodation  which will  be       available.  (Schedule A.)*            4.    An  endeavour has been  made  to assess more       accurately the  cost of maintaining these  two buildings *  It       must be  remembered that  the  Ambassador is  entitled  to free       quarters and  furniture,  and  that provision  is made  by the       Foreign  Office  in  his  &quot;frais&quot; to cover the  cost  of  heating,       lighting,  water,  etc.,  in  his quarters and the  Chanoery.                                -1-
It follows, therefore,  that if he moves into a more expensivehouse his &quot;frais&quot; must  be increased.   The staff, on theother hand, who are at  present receiving rent allowances and living in hotels are at present enjoying free heating,lighting, water, use of furniture, ^hich normally they wouldhave to provide themselves.   If they are to be accomodated in Charitonenko House a deduction from their emoluments tocover the cost of the above services is justifiable.   the annexed tabular statement, taking the above factors intoaccount, has been prepared to sho^ the estimated annualrunning costs, the amounts recoverable from the staff, andthe net cost of the proposed scheme compared with existing arrangements.   It must, however, be noted that in the absenceof accurate data the statement cannot be other than a roughindication of probable costs.  (Schedule B.).     5.    It will be seen that the use of the Charitonenkoand Hodgson houses will involve an annual expenditure ofapproximately  14,000,  showing an increase  of  4,000 perannum over present arrangements.   These figures can be defended on the ground that adequate accommodation will replace the present makeshift arrangements which aredetrimental to the welfare of the staff and the  successfulworking of the Embassy.   As regards the proposed paymentof  20,000 for possession, it is understood that there are some 70 people at present living in the house who will haveto be accommodated elsewhere, and there is, therefore,some justification,, if not for the  20,000, at least for aconsiderable  sum in the  shape of  compensation.   The fact,however,, must be faced that only a long tenure of theCharitonenko Hou3e would justify the payment of  the  20,000and a further expenditure of some  10,000 on alterations,and that this money would be entirely unproductive in theevent of the permanent withdrawal of the Mission.
                                                       q K                                                       o t) J     6.   In the event of the Soviet&apos;s terms &quot;being accepted,it is suggested that the Hodgson House should only he retainedif it proves impossible to make cheaper arrangements for thesurplus staff.   In the event of the position becoming morestable, it might be economical to constrict a building in thegarden of Charitonenko House with a view to concentrating thewhole Mi s si on ther e .     7.   An endeavour has been made to obtain a comparisonwith the Paris and Berlin Embassies, but it has been foundimpracticable,  owing partly to the fact that these buildings are Crown freeholds purchased many years ago and any rentalassessment would be entirely academic,  and partly to the factthat detailed information is not available as to the proportionof the nfrais;I  of the Ambassadors concerned which goes to meet expenditure on heating, lighting, water and other similarchar ges.
