THIS POCUMEMT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SSOgTi.                                                    Copy No. .P.95 (30),                                CABINET.                              TERRITORIAL WATERS.          Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade          The Foreign Seoretary&apos;s Memorandum (0.P.89) sets out the  two     important points on which the Admiralty, the Ministry of     Agriculture and Fisheries and my Department sire not  in agreement     with the report of the Inter-departmental Committee  and the main     reasons for our dissent,             (1) AS regards the suggested concession of 4 miles to          Norway and Sweden, I feel  strongly that any hint of such          a concession would make it quite impossible to  stand out          against similar claims by  other countries,             (2) AS regards the suggested extension of jurisdiction          up to 12 miles from the coast this is a matter  which may  and          in my opinion will have the most unfortunate consequences          to our Mercantile Marine,   It is strongly objected to by the          shipping interests and while we should always be ready to          co-operate with other countries, so far as is reasonable          and proper, this should in my view be done (as  in the case          of the United States) by special bilateral agreement and          subject to adequate safeguards.   My colleagues will bear          in mind these facts :-                (a) we own probably  one half of the world&apos;s             effective ocean going tonnage and therefore  present             a far larger target to  foreign interference  than             any other single country,                (b) If such a provision is agreed to in an internaticna3             convention, the United  States will get what  we
have conceded to them under the liquor agreementwithout the necessity of making any concession to us.They could therefore denounce the agreement and weshould lose its advantage (i*e. the right to carryliquor under seal into and through JJnited Stateswaters),  ihis is one of the few advantages which ourMercantile Marine has in competition with the heavily subsided American Mercantile Marine, and we cannot afford to give it up.(o) If but a provision is accepted it is likely that12 miles and not 3 will be the limit of territorial waters at no distant date.     I am definitely of opinion that no convention which accepts either of these bases should be signed by Great Britain./                          W.G.                         11.3.30.Board of Trade, &apos;: 11th March, 1930.
