Tm^DOOuMMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERW^iEj^).SgET.i.P. 91(30)COPY NO.          CABINET.   Importation of Bounty  Fed Cereals.Note by the Minister of Agriculture, and Fisheries.     I circulate for the  information of my colleagues a report by an Interdepartmental Conference  which has been held during the past month, at the request of the Prime Minister consisting of representatives of the Foreign Office, Board of Trade,  Board of Customs and Excise, Scottish Office and my Department, with regard to the importation into this country of so-called &quot;bounty-fed&quot;  cereals.    The report sets cut all the relevant facts with regard to the importation of wheat and oats from Germany, and flour from France, and gives in a summarised form particulars of the defensive action which other countries are taking. * I would draw the special attention of the                          * - Cabinet to paragraph 21  in which it is suggested  that if the Government should come to the  conclusion that there is no objection on grounds of general  policy to  impos- ing countervailing duties upon the importation of &quot;bounty fed&apos;1 cereals, the Law Officers of the Crown \ might be invited to consider the correct interpretation of the Anglo-German Commercial Treaty, and advise as to- whether or not the Government is free to take action along these lines without denouncing the Treaty.    The report explains the risks which the Government would have to take if we contemplated  denouncing the Treaty so as to obtain freedom to place an embargo upon or to Impose countervailing duties against German oats., and wheat, and in the national interest it mightnot
not bo wise to &quot;denounce this Treaty.  The broadresult, however, of maintaining the Treaty i3 thatBritish agriculturo is called upon to face unfair competition rather than that the nation should run the risk of injury to our export trade by denouncingthe Treaty.  It Is facts of this kind which give *rise to demands among agriculturists for specialState assistance.

THE IMPORTATION OF BOUNTY-FED CEREALS.    Note by Inter-departmental Conference (Ministry of        Agriculture, Board of Customs, Beard of            Trade, Foreign Office aiid Scottish                           Office).                                             i   1.-  In considering the existing depression In arablefarming it will be well at the outset to recognise twofundamental facts.   The first is that the level of grainprices is determined generally by the world supply.   Thesecond is that depression In arable farming is not peculiar to this country.   It is world wide and is theresult of surplus production and the downward mtve^ent ofprices to an uneconomic level.   An inevitable, if notimmediate, result of continued uneconomic production is adecline in the acreage under cultivation and it is this danger which has caused various countries to devise schemes to counteract the tendency of growers to reduce theircereal acreage by ensuring to them an economic return fortheir crops.   While these schemes have been devised witha legitimate object, they operate, for reasons given later in this memorandum, to the detriment of growers in this andother countries which have not adopted any defensive measures.Moreover, while these schemes are only of minor importance as a cause of the existing depression among cereal growers Inthis country, they have given rise to a degree of anxietywhich calls for a careful examination of their nature and effect.   2.   The German Import Bonds System.  The system whichhas caused most concern among  British agriculturists, andthe one of real practical importance, is the German systemof Import Bondsj  and it will be convenient here to describe the origin, character and effects of this arrangement.
   3.   Tho system of Import Bonds in Germany was introduced in 1894 and after being suspended  during the war, togetherwith the duties on imported grain and. flour,  was-introduced in October 1925, shortly after the duties ongrain and flcur were re-imposed.   The scheme was designedto meet the difficulties arising from, the fact that the mainwheat producing area of Germany - Eastern Prussia - was sofar from the principal consuming area - the industrial -west -that railway freight charges made it difficult for Germanwheat to compete with wheat from overseas.   The object wasto alloar the Prussian farmer to export his wheat and still to retain the benefit cf the higher prices ruling in the homeprotected market.   Broadly speaking, the original schemeprovided that the exporter of grain would, be given an importlicence authorising the duty free importation of an equivalent quantity of similar grain to that exported.   If aton of -wheat were exported a ton of wheat might be importedduty free.   An Important change took place in 1906 -whenimport bonds were made negotiable and applicable to importsof dissimilar grains.   The commodities specified In thedecree by which tho system was modified, were rye, wheat, spelt,barley, oats and pulse.   To these maize and daring (a colonialproduct) was added m 1928.   Thero is power in times of shortage of grain to suspend the import bond system, a course which was actually taken in respect of some cereals in 1927.     As a result of a law of 22nd December last, theposition is altered to the extent that the value of theimport bond need not be and in fact is net at the presenttime - as high as the import duty.   The rates of import duty for wheat and oats have been raised to 4/9d and 4/-respectively per cwt. whereas the value of the corresponding
import bonds remains for the time being at 3/3d and 3/-respectively which were the rates of import duty previouslyin force.   This mcdification took effect on February 11th,1930, and as a result the German exporter is now placed ina less favourable position than formerly.   4.   The fact that import bonds are negotiable in germany at almost their face value means that the exporter obtainsfor his grain not only the price at which he sells but also anamount. almost *qual to the value of the import bond.   He can therefore sell in our markets at a price lover than would otherwise be possible and that price can clearly be lessthan the price of native wheat ruling in Germany and may even be below the world price.   It is doubtless the fact thatthe system involves a bounty that has produced a widespread and damaging psychological  effect among British farmers.    fi.   Effect of the German system.   The two cereals withwhich the British grower is most concerned in thisconnection are wheat and oats, and inasmuch as thecircumstances are not parallel it will be convenient todiscuss the effect of importations on these two cerealsseparately.   6.   Wheat.  The quantity of wheat produced in GreatBritain represents on average only about 20 per cent of thetotal supply.   The 80 per cent, imported vheat constitutes a wide margin within which the contribution from any one country may vary considerably.   It would be expected inview of the effect generally attributed by farmers to german exports, that the quantity of wheat received from germany has shown substantial increases during recent years.   Thesingular feature, in the circumstances, is that during thelast two years the amount of -wheat received from Germany was
somewhat.&apos;  lower than -what might be regarded as the normallevel.   In the cereal year 1925-6 the quantity of wheat rreceived from Germany was 3,999,000 cwt.   In the following two years the amount was in comparison negligible, owingto the temporary suspension of the import bond system andthe general shortage of wheat.   In 1928/29 the amount was2,709,000 cwt. while imports during the first five monthsof the current cereal year amounted to only 489,000 cwt.as compared with 1,824,000 cwt. for the similar period m1928/29.   Any effect which imports of German wheat may havehad on prices cannot therefore be due to any increase In thequantity sent to this country.   Moreover, the contribution which. Germany makes to the wheat supplies of Great britain is relatively very small.   In the last four cereal yearsimports of German wheat have constituted from nil to 3 percent, of the total supplies, from 1 to  1&quot; per cent, of thetotal crop in Great Britain and from  1  to 17 per  cent, ofthe average  amount of the home crop  3old for milling.  Thesefigures suggest that the imported supplies affecting theBritish market are not those from Germany.   In thisconnection the figures concerning Argentina are illuminating.In the cereal year 1925/26 Argentina  supplied 14,781,000 cwt.of wheat to the United Kingdom, and the quantity  hasprogressively risen since then, the amount received from this source in 19PS/29 being  29,409,000 cwt.   During  the first five  months of the current  cereal year the amount of wheat.received from Argentina  was 23,430,000  cwt. as compared with8,326,000 cwt. in the corresponding period of 1928/29.   Theappearance of German wheat to  the amount of little over  million cwt. since the harvest of 1928 has  this causedmore  comment  than the importation of  53 million cwt. fromArgentina during the same period.
Q 5 9*J fcjr  )     70  In determining the effect of competitive wheats  inthe British market, however, regard must be had to the kinds of wheat involved.   British wheat is a soft wheat,  and assuch is more susceptible to direct competition from bothGerman and Argentine wheats which are of a similar character.It might therefore be expected that the effect of the muchgreater proportion of Argentine wheat on the British market should be overwhelming as compared with that of Germanwheat, and nothing has emerged from the situation to suggest any other conclusion.  It is probably true, however, thatthe local and psychological effect of the imports of Germanwheat is rather greater than their actual amount would suggest, owing to the circumstances of their importation.For example, a cargo of German wheat arriving at an Eastern port in this country might be unshipped directlyat a port mill and might affect to some extent the localmarket for English wheat.  Argentine wheat on the otherhand does not come into direct competition with Englishwheat in the same way since it is usually purchased by the big port millers.  Examination of the prices at the moreimportant local wheat markets, however, does not reveal anynoticeable irregularity between these and the generalaverage for England and Wales.  Any depression which mayhave occurred in British prices appears to have beon feltmore or less evenly throughout the country and not to havebeen concentrated in any particular markets:  and, as a fact of some importance, it may be mentioned that ascompared with world prices the prices of British wheathave not been unduly depressed.
     8.  Oats.    The position in regard to oats is somewhat different.   Although over RO per cent, of thetotal supply of oats in Great Britain is home producedthe greater part of  this is consumed on farms, moreespecially in England and lales, and does not come onto the markets  the effect, therefore, of a&apos; substantial increase in the quantity imported may well be aopreciable.It is clear, however, that the decline in the price of oats has not been caused by any abnormal increase inthe total quantity imported.  During the last completedcereal year (1928/2^) the total quantity imported was rather below the average for the preceding four cerealyears,  In 1924/25 the total quantity received was,721,000 cwt.  in 1925/26,  9,4-57,000 cwt. in 1926/27,5,600,000 cwt.  in 1927/28  7,724y000 cwt. and in 192^/296,202,000 cwt.   There has been, during the last fivecereal years, however, a notable change in the sourceswhence these imports have been derived.  The amountreceived from North America, especially the UnitedStates, has fallen considerably, while thf amountreceived from Germany has shown a very substantial increase.  The total quantity of German oats received bythe United Kingdom in 1935/26 was 376,00o cwt.  and in1928/29 it was 1,446,000 cwt. while  in the first five months of the current year it was 1,632,000 cvt. orappreciably more than for the whole  of the previous year.In 1925/36 the German contribution represented 4$ of  thetotal quantity of oats imported, and lyi of the total supply of Great Britain, while in 1923/29 the  correspondingproportions were 34 and 3 per cent,  respectively.  Inthe first five months of the current cereal year, imported
                                                   0 *3 r*German oata represented 52% of the total imports of oats during the period.  The tendency would appear tobe for imports of German oats to return to the level which obtained in the years prior to the War, and whichin 1903 amounted to nearly 4 million cwt.   As regardsoats, therefore, the British market has been affectedby a very much greater proportion of German oats than is the case with wheat, and it must be recognised thatthe depression in prices has been probably due in part to the low prices at which these oats are offered.  Thisis especially true of Scotland.     9. Schemes of other countries.  While it may becorrect to conclude that the actual effect of the GermanImport Bond system has been much over-estimated, thereis no doubt some reason to be apprehensive concerningthe adoption of this or somewhat similar methods by  othercountries, the collective effect of which may possibly in the future constitute a- menace to the British growersof cereals.  Schemes modelled on that of Germany havebeen adopted by Poland, Sweden and Austria, while Italy has in contemplation a somewhat similar scheme  which will operate after seasons  of abundant harvests.  It must,however, be remembered that  the volume  of trade betweenGreat Britain and these countries is not sufficiently large to render them of much importance at the  presenttime in regard to the  question under consideration.     10.  French wheat law.  The measures recently taken in France to safeguard  the interests of the Frenchfarmer have attracted  aoine attention from British farmersThese measures have been embodied in the French Wheatlaw of December, 1929, and the provisions which affectBritish agriculture are those governing the  import  of7heat into France and  the export of flour.   Before  thepassing of this law French millers were permitted  to
import wheat on the payment of the appropriate  duties and were enabled to secure a refund of the duty on anyproportion exported as flour, semolina etc.  the dutyon any part not exported passing over to the FrenchTreasury.  The new law removes the option previouslygiven to millers of leaving in France all or part  ofthe flour produced from imported wheat and millersare now obliged under penalty to re-export within  threemonths a quantity of wheat or flour to be fixed bydecree corresponding to the wheat imported.   A refundof duty paid on imported wheat may be claimed on flouror wheat exported.  It is difficult to see in thissystem any resemblance to a subsidy.  It is clear  thatin fact the system is a disguised import restrictionwhich precludes millers from importing wheat unless they export the products of their industry.  In so faras a monetary penalty is actually incurred by failure to export, it acts as an increase of import duty.   Itspermanent effect is therefore to divert to this andother markets wheat which might otherwise have gone to France.  As in the case of German wheat the quantityof flour received from France is relatively a verysmall proportion of the total supply imported intothis country, S per cent, in 1923/29 being the highestfigure during the last five cereal years.   The total quantity of wheat flour imported into the UnitedKingdom was about 10 million cwt. in the cereal years1924/25 and 1925/26 and 11 million in 1926/27.  Thequantity has since declined to 3,600,000 owe.- in logq/39.
                                            9 9 imports of French flour on the other hand afterdeclining from 151,003 cwt. in 1925/26 to about  90,000cwt. in the following two years, rose to 232,000 cwt.in 1921/29 and for the first five months of the  currentcereal year amounted to 475,000 cwt.    11* Defensive action abroad.   The depressed   4condition of arable farming in Continental countries has caused Governments to view with alarm the additionalcontributory factor represented by the operations ofthese schemes for assisting the export of cereals,  and various defensive measures have been adopted or are beingconsidered in the countries affected. Increasedtariffs have been adopted by Czeeho-Slovakia and Finland,while Belgium has prohibited the importation of wheat and wheat flour except under licence, a proceeding which appears to be contrary to the terms of the ProhibitionsConvention to which Belgium is a party (see para. 32).Schemes for the compulsory milling&apos;of a&quot;proportion ofhome-grown wheat are being considered or have alreadybeen adopted by Italy, Sweden, Gzecho-Slovakia and greece, while a state monopoly controls the grain tradein Norway and Switzerland and a similar monopoly isbeing considered in Czecho-Slovakia.    12.  The uneasiness prevailing in agriculturalcircles is probably accentuated by the thought thatGreat Britain, almost alone among the countriesaffected, has not adumbrated any proposals to counteract the effect of the assisted competition of foreign cereals.Various remedies have been suggested and it is necessaryto  examine these in some detail.
                                                        9 9 0                                                        ei ti1 0     13. It will -be convenient to consider possible remediesunder three heads:-     A, Restriction by tariff or prohibition of the         Importation of foreign cereals,  (paras, 14-32).     B. Representations to tho Governments concerned on         grounds of international comity, (paraa. 33-36).     0. General remedios viz, legislation requiringicompuksory         milling of a proportion of British wheat and oats         or tho establishment of a Board for the purchase of         cereals.  (paras 37-38).                        A* Restrictions.     14. Action in the direction first indicated above might betaken by imposing either (1) a duty on imported cereals from all sources, or (2) a countervailing duty upon era prohibit!on against all cereals which have received some form of bounty on export.     15. All round duty.   The first of these alternatives wouldinvolve a reversal of tha policy, which has hitherto boon common ground to all parties, that no tariffs should be imposed on imported foodstuffs.   Whether a duty on imported cereals hadthe effect of increasing the cost of foodstuffs to the public ornot it is certain that any subsequent rise In price would be attributed by consumers to that cause.   In any case account would have to be taken of any obligations which may be imposedupon this country in consequence of the negotiations now inprogress in regard to a Tariff Truoo.     16. Countervailing duties or prohibitions.   Anotherpossible solution is to restrict the Importation of bounty-fedcereals either by imposing a duty directed against such importsor by prohibiting their importation, except under licence orentirely.   A countervailing duty might be Imposed by legislation,providing that bounty fed cereals, whatever their origin, shouldbo subject to a special duty, or by the imposition of a counter-vailing duty specifically directed against any particular countryin Which a bounty scheme was in operation.   Here a^ain the
possibility of further commitments in connection with thoTariff Truce should not bo lost sight of.    Attention must  alsobo called to tho fact that our treaties with most importantcommercial countries contain a provision that goods  coming from those countrlos shall not be subject  on Importation intothis country to any &quot;other or higher duties.or charges thanthose paid on the like articles produced or manufactured in anyother foreign country&quot;.   A similar provision with regard toprohibitions is included in many of these  treaties..    Subjectto the possible exception in connection with bounty-fod sugar,which is examined in detail below, the view which has been consistently taken by His Majosty&apos;s Government is that it isnot compatible with the wording of these treaties to tako intoaccount, in deciding whether or not articles are &quot;like artlclos&quot;,anything other than the intrinsic  qualities of the  articlesthemselves.   Conditions of manufacture or othor considerations which hftvo no bearing on tho essential qualities of  thearticles themselvos must not be taken into account.    If thisview is maintained it is impossible to contend that  wheat which has received a bounty is not a &quot;like article&quot;  with wheatnot so favoured,     17. Troaty intorpretation:  Law Officers/&apos; opinion.  Thequestion of the propor interpretation of the words &quot;likearticles&quot; in this connection was put to the Law Officers in1887 when the question of bounty fed sugar was under active consideration.   The opinion expressed by  Sir Richard Websterand Sir Edward Clarke was:-          &quot;in our opinion, the word3 ......... &quot;like goods&quot;     refer tc the quality, nature and description of tho     article.   Neither expression has, we think, any     reference to the conditions of manufacture&quot;.                           &apos;  -11-
     The expression &quot;condition of manufacture1&apos; h&amp;.d special reference to the payment of a bounty,     13, The Sugar Convention.   Later, however, the difficultiesengendered by the widespread practice of paying bounties on sugar production led to an international Conference which washeld at Brussels in 1902.   At this Conference a convention was concluded by which the Parties bound themselves not to grantbounties on sugar in their own countries, and to place acountervailing duty upon or to impose an absolute prohibitionagainst the importation of sugar from countries which continuedto subsidise sugar production.   The question whether anyparticular country was actually subsidising sugar was left tobe determined by an International Commission sitting at Brussels,Ho saving clause was inserted in the Convention to safeguard theinterests of countries which had most-favoured-nation rights under treaties with the Parties to the Convention,     19* The case of Russia.   The Convention became operativein 1903 and the necessary legislation was brought into forcein this country by the Sugar Convention Act, 1903,   Under thisAct power was taken to prohibit by Order in Council theimportation of sugar from any country which was declared by thePermanent Commission to be subsidising sugar production.   no powers were taken to impose countervailing duties.   Among thecountries which were not parties to the Convention when itfirst cane into force and which were declared by the permanent commision to be subsidising sugar production was Russia.Great Britain was therefore under an obligation, imposed by theConvention, to prohibit the importation of sugar from Russia,and such a prohibition was imposed in spite of the fact that theAnglo Russian treaty contained the usual most-favoured nation clause containing the stipulation with regard to &quot;like articles&quot;.
This action- was a departure  from  the  strict  interpretationwhich this  country had otherwise  placed  upon the  most-favoured-nation provisions of Treaties,    It would appear  howeverdifficult to quote this  case as a precedent  for varying the traditional interpretation of our  commercial  treaties;  therewas a clash between the  obligations under a  bilateral  treaty and a multilateral Convention respectively and. it was  notpossible to comply with  the provisions of both instruments atthe same time.     20. The question of the strict interpretation of  theobligations of this country with  regard  to Pvussia does notappear to have been submitted, to  the  Law Officers at that time,,The Austrian Government, however, raised a somewhat half-heartedobjection to the action  of the Government of India in  Imposingcountervailing duties against Austrian sugar in anticipation ofthe coming into force of the Convention  in 1905.    The replyto this protest pointed,  out that  the  coming  into  operation ofthe Convention had been deferred,  against the&apos; wishes of theBritish Delegation, that the difficulty  was  purely a temporaryone and quoted a statement made by the Marquess of Salisburyin 1899 to the following effectj-     &quot;Her Majesty&apos;s Government are not disposed, to admit thatany Government has the right by such  means (ifte.  by a  system ofbounties) to override the clear intention of the  most-favoured-nation clause, which is, that goods shall enjoy equality oftreatment, but not preferential advantages,  as compared withgoods of the most favoured nation,    hen an  artificial preference of such a character Is produced by the direct legislative Act
   23. Special ireaty  provisions on Bounty-fed goods.    Asa result of the difficulties which wore experienced oversugar bounties, and with a view to obtaining some security against legitimate diplomatic complaints in futuro oases,a clause was inserted in most treaties concluded from thobeginning of this century up to 1934, making a specialexception from most-favoured-nation treatment in the caseof goods which had received a bounty .in the country of origin.     The treaties with the following countries containclauses excepting bounty fed goods from most-favoured-nation treatment in the matter both of duties and of prohibitions:           Austria      Czechoslovakia      Estonia           Finland      Guatemala           Honduras           Latvia       Panama              SiamSimilar provisions, which apply only to prohibitions andnot to duties, aro included In the -treaties with Spain andwith Portugal.      A clause on these lines was proposedin the first draft which was submitted to the Germans inconnection with the negotiations for a treaty with them in1924.     Ihey refused to accept the provision, which doesnot therefore appear1 in the Anglo-German Treaty.       British Sugar Subsidy.   About this time, theproposal to subsidise home-grown beet sugar was adopted inthis country, and it was felt desirable not to pressthereafter for tho special clause exempting bounty-fedarticles from most-favourod-nation treatment.     Theconsideration that such a clause might bo turned againstourselves applies now not only to sugar but also to silk andpossibly to coal,  (See paragraphs 27 and 54-36 below).
                                                        3/? s                                                        w &apos;11)     25&apos; Germany.   The countries which are of interest fromthe particular point of view of bounties on cereals areGermany, Poland and France.  In the case of Germany, the Treatyof 1924 forbids the imposition of a duty on German goods unless a similar duty is placed upon &quot;like articles&quot; from othercountries.   A countervailing duty on bounty fed cereals is,therefore, barred, pending any opinion that the Law Officers,if consulted, may give to the country (see paragraph 21).  Withregard to prohibitions, there are in the Anglo-German Treaty,specific provisions which stipulate not merely that Germanyshall receive most-favoured-nation treatment in this matter,but that no prohibitions, except such as were specially notifiedat the time the treaty was made, should be imposed on theimportation of goods from Germany into this country.  Thisprovision is, of course, reciprocal, and there are the usualexceptions for prohibitions imposed, for example, on eanitarygrounds or grounds of public security- but no exception in regardto bounty fed goods.     26* Effects of possible denunciation.   The Anglo-GermanTreaty can be brought to an end by denunciation by either party,the Treaty ceasing to have effect 12 months from the date ofsuch denunciation.  It is, however, important to consider there actions which denunciation on our part might be expected tohave upon trade with Germany.  It is true that commercial relations were carried on with Germany for some years withoutany Treaty being in existence;  but the position which would arise as a result of the denunciation of a treaty for the specific purpose of retailiaton by one Party against the goods
of tho other might be expected to be very different fromthe position obtaining when two countries trade with one another on a basis of mutual goodwill even in the absence of specific treaty stipulations.   The way would clearly beopen for all kinds of retaliation by Germany against british goods and, what is quite as important, against british shipping.  While the last Government were in office therewas a serious agitation in Germany to denounce the Treatyowing to the policy of safeguarding, but the agitation hasdied down since that policy was abandoned.     27. Coal and Shipping.   There is at present a prohibition against the importation of coal into Germany,except under licence, and British exporters complain of thedifficulties which are experienced in obtaining licences for the importation into Germany of British coal.  (coal was one of the prohibitions notified before the entry intoforce of the German Treaty but the Germans gave certainassurances that licences would not be unreasonably withheld).Difficulties with regard to differential treatment of british coal in the matter of railway rates are also being experienced in Germany.  The denunciation of the treaty would almost certainly be followed by a much more rigidrestriction of the importation of British coal into Germany,particularly as they might argue that under our de-ratingscheme British coal was the subject of an export bounty.The value of exports of British coal to Germany in 1929 was3f million pounds.  Retaliation might also be expected bymeans of duties directed against British goods generally,and very grave difficulties from which entire freedom isnot enjoyed, even under the Treaty, might be expected by
British shipping which has always operated under somehandicaps in Germany.  It is worth while remembering thatthe value of our exports to Germany in 1928 was about41 million pounds.   In considering the denunciation oftho anglo-German Treaty the advantage of obtaining freedom to place a countervailing duty upon, or to prohibit theimportation of bounty fed cereals, must be balanced againstthe risk of losing at least part of this export trade, and doing considerable damage to British shipping.     28. France.  In the case of France, as has been pointed out above, it is very doubtful whether any system which could properly be called a bounty, actually exists.The treaty position is, however, that the Anglo-FrenchCommercial Convention of 1882 expressly excludes fromits provisions any stipulations with regard to Customs&apos;duties, which are left subject to the internal laws of thetwo countries,.   France would therefore have no ground forprotest under the Convention if a duty were placed uponimports of bounty fed cereals into this country.  In spite,however, of the absence of treaty provisions with regardto most-favoured-nation treatment in regard to Customs&apos;duties, British goods have always received in France most-favoured-nation treatment by virtue of a French lawpromulgated on February 22nd, 1882.   This Law declares that goods of English origin or manufacture shall be liable on their entry into France to the same treatment asthose of the most favoured nations, with the exceptionof Colonial produce which, it is declared, would remain
subject to the General CuEtoms&apos; tariff.  Under this LawBritish goods are subject to the minimum tariff, whereas the goods of countries not entitled to moet-favoured-nation treatment are subject to the rates of the generaltariff, which are usually three or four times as high asthe minimum tariff rates.  The French Government also have the power to place a special surtax on goods coming from countries which do not, in their opinion, treatFrench goods fairly.  A recent example is the impositionof duties equal to twice the general rates on wheat andbutter from Australia, which was an act of retaliation against the new Australian tariff.  If therefore anydiscriminatory action were taken against the importationof cereals from France, it is scarcely to be expected thatthe French Government would refrain from repealing thelaw which gives British goods the benefit of the minimumtariff, or would hesitate to place special retaliatoryduties upon them, if they thought that course desirableon other grounds.  Our exports to France in 1928 werevalued at a little over 25 million pounds, of which aboutseven millions was coal.  Discrimination by France againstimports from this country would therefore be a serious matter.     29.  With regard to prohibitions, France has most-favoured-nation rights under the Anglo-French convention of 1582 and so long as his Iviajesty&apos;s Government areprecluded from placing a prohibition upon imports ofcereals from other countries, they are precluded fromimposing the same measure against French goods.
     30*  Poland.  In the case of Poland, it mightprobably be held that it was possibles to impose a duty onbounty fed cereals from that country, or to prohibittheir importation, as the terms of the &apos;anglo-PolishTreaty of 1923 are not so precise as the terms of mostof our other Treaties.  As, however, practically no cerealshave been imported from Poland, this question is scarcelyworth pursuing.     31. Prohibitions Convention.   The freedom of his majesty&apos;s Government to impose import prohibitions isrestricted not only by bilateral treaties, but also bythe International Convention for the Abolition of ImportProhibitions and Restrictions.  The Convention, which isbinding upon this country until June, 1931 at least, andmay in certain circumstances be binding for a longer period, prevents the imposition of any new prohibition or restriction on Import, except on the usual special grounds,such as those of public Eafety and the health of animalsand plantsc  The Convention, therefore, makes it impossibleto impose prohibitions or restrictions on the importationof bounty fed cereals, at any rate for some time to come.In this connection it may be pointed out that freedom toimpose prohibitions and restrictions in this country meansfreedom by other countries to follow the same policy, andthe international movement which led to the Convention wasthe direct outcome of the enormous difficulties encounteredby trade in the years immediately following the war, owingto the prevalence on the Continent of prohibitions andrestrictions.
   32.  Belgium.  Mention has been made earlier in this memorandum (para. 11) of the action whichBelgium has taken recently in prohibiting theimportation of wheat, wheat flour and wheat meal,except under licence.  The wording of the preamble tothe Belgian Decree suggests that the BelgianGovernment realise that the action is a broachof the Prohibitions Convention.  The preamblesuggests that if their action is challenged, theBelgian Government will appeal to Article 5 of theConvention which says:-   &quot;Not-ing in this convention shall  affect the right of  any High Contracting Partyto adopt measures...........   for the purpose of protecting in extraordinary  and  abnormal circumstances,the vital  interests  of the country&quot;.  This  is followedby a  provision  against arbitrary discrimination  insuch  circumstances against any other High contracting party. The  Article  in question  was  intended tosafeguard  the position of  a  country  in case ofcatastrophe,  such  as  war  or  famine,  and  not to providea loophole itfhich  in  effect completely  nullifies  the usefulness of the  Convention.  Newspaper reports suggestthat  the action was  taken in view  of the new Frenchexport Regulations  (see  para.10),  though the BelgianDecree is  of general application.   So  far  it is  not known whether licences to import wheat and its productshave  actually been refused,  nor  whether  France,  thecountry most intimately  concerned,  has made anyprotest in the  matter.
               B. Representations.   33.  It has been alternatively suggested that thematter can best be dealt with by approaching theGovernments of the countries concerned on grounds of international amity.  An approach has already     &apos;been made along this line.  At a recent meeting atGeneva of the Economic Committee of the League ofNations the British Member was instructed to raisethe general question of bounty-fed exports, and todiscuss the position as relating particularly toGermany with the German Member.  The^ British Member&apos;sstatement was sympathetically received thethe German Member undertook to review the question on his  return to Germany.   The President  of the  Boardof7Trade  also spoke to  the  German representativeabout this matter at Geneva when he was thererecently  in c onaexion with  the Tariff TruceConference.  The reply  was  that  the vie^s of Bisiua.]&quot;esty&apos;s  Government with regard to wheat wouldprobably  be  met  by the  increase  in the  German  tariff (see  para.3)  -md the regulation  as to milling  Germanwheat,  but that  the case  of oats was more difficult.   TVePresident was  assured  that  the German Governmentwould examine  the position  as  they were anxious  to collaborate  with the U ited Kingdom,  Ir  view  of these representations  it  may be  doubted whether formal diplomatic  action in Berlin would be desirable  in- the  Immediate future-,     34,  British Silk  Drawbacks.  A further reason for  doubting the wisdom of  representations  is  the practical certainty that  the scope  of  any formal discussion with regard to  the bounty  system would quickly be widened to  include  that  of the British system of
drawback in connection with the silk duties.  Co morethan one occasion the German Government have alleged that the export drawbacks on British made silk(including artificial silk) contain bounty elements.vith this possibility in mind the Chancellor of theExchequer was asked whether he would object torepresentations to the German Government on the groundthat the silk drawback question would almost certainly be raised in consequence.  He replied th:it he would raise no objection on this ground.   35.  In this connection It must be admitted that thedrawbacks on yarns, fabrics and apparel, etc., madein this country from duty paid materials do include in most cases amounts in excess of the duty borne bythe particular article, and there would, therefore, beample opportunity for the Germans to challenge thedrawback rates on the ground that they operated asdisguised bounties.  In doing so they would be able topoint to the fact that the United States Treasury haverecently decided that the rates do contain a bountyelement.  Further, they have published a schedule ofBritish silk manufactures with the amounts of the bountiesas calculated by them, and have imposed appropriatecountervailing duties.   The silk trade have made norepresentations with regard to the action of the UnitedStates Treasury, a fact which probably indicates thatthe trade realise that an export bounty does to someextent exist.  There can be no doubt, however that anygeneral reduction of the British drawback rates,especially at the present time, would be r..sented, notonly by the  silk and artificial silk trades, but also by the cotton and woollen trades which are large users ofsilk and artificial silk in the production ofmixed fabrics.
   36.   It is unnecessary to state in detail tile grounds onwhich foroign governments and foreign manufacturers mightcontend that the drawback system operates as a bounty or howfar this contention might be disputed.   It is perhapssufficient to say that while it might be possible to meet the complaints of the German Government on one or two minor points,though not without protests from British traders, it would notbe possible to meet their full demands without a completereconstruction of the scheme of the silk duties.                    G.  General herredios.     There remain two proposals which are being consideredelsewhero from the point sf view of policy and practicability.They are included in this memorandum only because so far as their adoption improved  the general situation of arablefarming it would render the question of the importation ofbounty-fed cereals of less importance.     The first is that millers in this country should berequired by law to mill a certain percentage of home-grown wheat, or that bakers should be compelled to use a fixedproportion of British flour in each loaf.   The second is theformation of a Board with powers to purchase and control either the home crop or all supplies of wheat and possibly othercereals.   There appears to be nothing in the first proposal which could be held to contravene the provisions of any treaty or Convention to which this country is a party.   This system,indeed, is in force in Germany and other countries with whichwe have commercial treaties.   The same  applies to the secondproposal, so long as the operations of the Board are not confined to imported cereals since the prohibition of goods which are the subject of an internal monopoly is allowableunder both the Anglo German Treaty  and  the international convention for the Abolition of Import and Ixoort Prohibitions
-2 P.-and Restrictions.   38.    It should however be added that, in the opinion ofthe Scottish Department, it is doubtful -whether the firstscheme  would be of much, if an;/, assistance to Scotland.These are also special difficulties with regard to theapplication of the second scheme to the case of oats, which areof primary interest to Scotland.   These are being examinedelsewhere.
