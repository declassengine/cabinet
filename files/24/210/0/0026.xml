76 (30)fcural        C A B I N 5 T.THE SITUATION IN AGPJ CULTURE.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture           and Fisheries.            1. A new situation in agriculture  of  considerable urgency         arises  from the  recent proceedings  in the Agricultural         Conference,  the  Conservative  decision to take up a policy of         subsidised  prices,  and the  request  of the Liberal Party for         a Debate  on Agriculture in  the  House  of  Commons on 10th March.            2. The Conference  has discussed  various  proposals involvingcr-rence.   protection,  either  direct or  indirect, though informed of the         Cabinet1s inability to adopt  a  protective policy.  It has been         widely  advertised as  concentrating  upon  the question of the         maintenance of cereal growing,  and  thus  has helped to emphasise         the depression in arable farming.             The  proposals  which the  Conference  has discussed have been  -                (1)  A guaranteed price  involving a  subsidy.                (2)  Compulsory percentage of  home-grown wheat to be                      used  by millers.                (3)  Prohibition of  bountj^-fed produce.         These are supported by landowners and farmers at the Conference,         but are described as  inadequate unless combined with a high         minimum price.            3. The Conference  unanimously passed  on  14th February,  1930         the following resolution, which was moved by Sir George Courthope         and seconded by  Mr. Gooch,  one  of the representatives of the         National  Union of Agricultural  Workers -                   &quot;The Conference desires to  record its unanimous             opinion that assistance  to the agricultural industry             cannot be adequate unless  effective steps  are taken to             make reasonably  profitable the growing of  the principal             cereals and primarily  wheat&quot;./THIS DOGU^ST IS OSES PHOPEBTY Off HIS BfilTAhTTIC MAJESTY13 GOYIHRiflaENT) . ?m                                                    Copy No.
   4. I have induced the Conference to discuss two distinctplans of our own -     (1) The Import Board proposal (which is before an        Inter-Oepartmental Committee), and     (2) assistance to marketins organisations for home        produce on the lines of the Bill sow before a        Cabinet Sub-Committee.This Scheme has found increased support from members of theConference as discussion ha,s proceeded.   iVeither of theseproposals, however, will have an immediate effect on the cereal situation, and they both involve legislation.   5. The question of interim measures for relieving theposition of cereal growers was raised at the Conference bylir. John Beard, a &quot;workers1 Representative, and at the meetingon Frida^r last, after a whole day&apos;s discussion the Conferencefinally passed unanimously the following resolution:-          &quot;This Conference views with the utmost concern the     present position in arable agriculture, the increase in     unemployment amongst agricultural worker:, the amount     of land going out of cultivation, and the lack of     confidence created thereby.   The Conference therefore     desires to place before His Majesty&apos;s Gova. nment its     unanimous opinion that measures should be taken to     assure to farmers a remunerative price for cereals.     .&apos;.&apos;he Conference has under consideration various proposals     for securing this object, but further detailed     examination of them is required to enable it to make     final recommendations.   Meanwhile the economic condition     of arable agriculture is deteriorating and aggravating     the unemployment problem.   In order to avert further     deterioration there is urgent need for an immediate     pronouncement calculated to restore confidence to the     industry in the meantime.&quot;
      This  resolution would  imply a measure  of  artificial aid.         6.  The  Conservative  proposal  is a sudden  reversal of the icy.  policy of  the last  six years - a policy of refusal  to grant      protection in any form, a refusal which has  been  argued by      Lr. Baldwin and &apos;.,r. Guinness in  the face  of  great pressure.         7.  The  plan of guaranteed prices is extremely  difficult      to  carry out.   The only occasion when it has been  put in      force  was  under the Corn I-reduction -let (Repeal)  .ict in 1921,      and on that occasion it was found impossible to apply except -      in the form of a fired  acreage grant,  which  apart from general      effect, loses the advantage of a stimulus to high production      on  individual holdings.   This w.*.a one reason why the      proposal of 1923 took  a  ora which made it unsound  and      helped to  lose the  lection.         G.  The  new plan  of  a guraanteed price  is  limited to wheat      and therefore ignores  the chief  claim  of  .&apos;j cot land,  which  is      for a  standard price of oats..    The proposal to  put an embargo      on bounty-fod oats, even if it were put in force  despite  the      resulting  danger to our export trade through denunciation of      certain Commercial  Treaties, which is  an  essential  preliminary,      would  not  adequately affect the  price  of  oats.         9.  The  new policy must have boon adopted  under a sense of      extreme danger from the nsw protectionist movement, coupled      with  the depression in  farming,  though the fall in  prices has      been  somewhat similar  over a course of years and  has reached      a point which attracts  exceptional public sympathy..  .3 of 10.  The  drift towards a policy of subsidies influences  evenultur -      our own party for a Conference of Farm -iorkers convened on      the 22nd of February by the Agricultural  Section  of the      Transport  and General  iorkers Union, passed  a resolution      calling upon the Government &quot;to  make an immediate declaration      of  assistance to tils  the industry over the  gravest difficulties      which the  industry^has  had ID face in this generation&quot;, and      at  a  big mass meeting  at Cambridge on  Saturday last, presided
                                                                4.       over by Mr. Pretyman, Mr. George Dallas, M*P., moved and       Captain Morris, President of the National Farmers&apos; Union,       seconded, a resolution asking the Government to take measures       to ensure to farmers a remunerative price for cereals.eneral       11.  The position of arable farmers particularly in corn tion.       growing areas of East Anglia - which has been bad for some       years past - has got gradually worse and the future prospect       is very discouraging.  Farmers in arable districts are       renewing their demand for a reduction in wages and are       reducing their staffs.   Representatives of the agricultural       workers on the Conference report an increase of unemployment       amounting, for instance, to 3,000 in one county, and as a       result some of the Workers&apos; Representatives are adopting a       policy of protection.            IS.  The prevalent alarm is justified by the fall In prices,       which Is heaviest in the,case of oats and potatoes.   Wheat       is the chief topic of discussion in the case of England.       The fall in the price of wheat is not appreciably due to       German imports, but mainly to Argentine.   While there is       thus some real ground for alarmist views, the Inclination to       reduce expenses and dismiss men is intensified by the       psychological atmosphere, and by the indignation against       dumping.            13.  There are three ways in which assistance could be       given to agriculture              (1) Protection;              (2) Subsidies and bounties;              ( 3) State purchase through Import Boards.                 Protection we can rule out as inconsistent with       our Free Trade views, and the party&apos;s steadfast opposition       to anything in the shape of taxation on food.
     14,   Subsidies and bounties are,  as I have  pointed out above,  extremely difficult to carry out on any  basis, and unless large in amount and unlimited In duration are not likely to have any material effect in increasing the arable area or the number of workers employed. Moreover,  in view of the extreme variation in the  quality and productive capacity of the land It  is impossible to devise any scheme of subsidies which will not  result in the payment of a bonus to farmers who do not need it and for which no return will be received by ths nation.      15.   The third method of assuring  better prices to the farmer,  involving as it does the State  purchase of the entire  supply of a commodity required by the nation both from homo and overseas sources, does possess definite advantages over protective duties or subsidies. I am strongly of the opinion that the Import Board plan which figures so prominently in our policy, and to which the Party is fully pledged forms, with our  Agricultural Marketing Bill, the  only policy which we can place before the country as an alternative to the proposals of our opponents  for guaranteed prices.      16.   An alternative plan is the adaptation of the Import  Board scheme made by Sir Daniel  Hall who urges  that artificial aid is necessary.   His proposal is that the Board should  be  authorised to pay to the British farmer  differential prices  for home produce calculated to maintain  the arable area at a  recognised level.   The preference allowed would be determined from time to time  by Parliament.      17.   While it must be admitted that a contribution when world prices are low would be necessary from the Exchequer  to the Import Board,  artificial  aid may  be justified  on the grounds that -      (1) It is in the national Interest to maintain a  certain         proportion of arable farming;
stry of Agriculture and Fisheries,     4th March, 1930.      (2)  That without such help employment must be greatly          reduced.   Labour costs are  100$ more  than in 1914          yet farm workers are still  the worst  paid class  in          the community and financial aid for them would be          a contribution from the town workers  towards the          class which competes with them and lower town wages          if no longer employed in rural areas,      18,   Sir Daniel Hall sees great advantage also in the power given under the Scheme to influence the  Standard of farming and to bring about orderly marketing.      19.   From the attitude of the farmers&apos; representatives at the Agricultural  Conference it is clear that they would only regard an Import  Board scheme as satisfactory  if it guarantees a prico to the British farmer for his wheat, sufficient to make its cultivation an attractive proposition.      20.   I therefore hope that in the special circumstances of the time the Cabinet will authorise me to announce that it has ordered the preparation of a Bill on these lines.   If on the other hand, the element of artificial aid  is not agreed to, I ask for sanction to the preparation of an Imports Boards Bill without that  element.      21.   The intention of the Liberal Party to debate  the agricultural situation on Monday next,  and the  demands  in the House from time to time for a disclosure of our agricultural policy, make it essential that some  definite pronouncement of our plans should be made  in this Debate.
