[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET.C.P.  80  (30)..,                                         COPY  NO                             CABINET.             THE SITUATION  OF AGRICULTURE IN SCOTLAND.Ml  Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.     (1)  Before considering the remedies for the presentdepression in fanning the position of the arable farmershould be reviewed.  The crisis in Scottish agriculture is largely confined to the arable farmer.  The stock-breeder, flockmaster-and dairy farmer are not facingbankruptcy.  It is the arable farmer whose chief productsare grain and potatoes who is suffering and for whom marketinglegislation must be produced If a remedy is to be found for over-production, disorderly marketing and the attempt to sellinferior and unsuitable produce-     (2)  The grain grower is definitely and seriously handl-capped, but his position in British farming is comparativelyunimportant.  Less than 10p of the total value of  48,660,000produced on Scottish farms is derived from grain.  In england the percentage Is 10.7%.,  In Scotland 79.5% of the income ofthe farms comes from  livestock and livestock products, theremaining 2Q.5% coming from grain, potatoes, fruit and vegetables and in the following proportions :-           Grain.................................. 9 .5%           Potatoes................................ 6.4;i           Hay, Straw, Fruit, Vegetables and                                   Flowers -......... 4.6%    (3)   A certain proportion of grain must be grownon many farms for feeding purposed and this proportionmight indeed be Increased if the. system of farming can be altered to meet the changed circumstances.                      -  - -i-
In fact it should be so. altered as grain-growing, except as a bye-product of the&quot; farm, cannot be permanentlyprofitable in face of the competition from countries much better suited for cheap grain production unless we areprepared to subsidise the growing of grain in some form or another,     (4) The encouragement or stimulation of grain pro due-1tion for sale is a policy of doubtful utility under present world conditions.  In the case of wheat it would apply to5/o only of the agricultural output of Great Britain andwould maintain artificially an uneconomic system.  GreatBritain, and Scotland in particular, are exceptionallyfavoured for the production of food for stock, viz., grass,hay,  silage,  green crops and roots.  They have an enormoushorn,:;  market for livestock products, milk, butter, of which of which 55;. is imported, poultry, of which 37. . is imported,and potatoes of which 300j000 tons are imported.  the intensive &quot;production of these products does now, and will inthe future, prove profitable as the proper use of the land and the possibilities of the home market for these purposesis realised.     (5) Grain-growing for sale on the other hand has reached its limit or nearly.  No great advance can be made in the yield per acre.  The cost of production cannot be seriouslyreduced and cannot be reduced, to the scale of the competingcountries which have yet large areas tc bring into cereals andIkrge scope for increased production per acre.     (6) The area of the cereal crops in Scotland in 1929 was1,044,000 acres, comprising wheat 50,000 acres, barley 100,000acres and oats 838,000 acres.- The wheat area in Scotland is negligible and barley unimportant.  Oats are the main cerealcrop.  A large but unknown proportion of the oat crop is con-sumed on the farm, ana. 50,000 tons of oatmeal are manufacturedfrom part of the remainder.is imported, cheese,  of which 77,&apos;a is imported, eggs,
     (7)  Under the present system of farming a considerableacreage of oats will he grown for stockfeeding, hut apermanently low price fov oats will undoubtedly reduce thearable area.   This rediction of area will not involve theabandonment of farming.   It will mean a change to anothersystem more profitable and less risky than the present one.     (8)   The serious consideration is not only the&apos;position of the farmer but of the farm labourer.   while an intensive system of stock farming might employ as many men. as now, and possibly more, during the change over, whichwill take some years, care would require to be taken to seethat  as little displacement of labour as possible takes place, even, if temporary expedients and assistance have to beadopted.   If the situation is carefully handled during thepresent period there need be little, if any, unemployment among farm labourers.   At the same time it must beremembered that there has bean a steady reduction in thenumber of farm labourers for many years partly due todecreasing cultivation; but also due to the greater use ofmachinery and better organisation of labour.   Decreasedemployment due to the latter cause will occur in any event.     (9)   There appear to be several remedies for theserious plight of agriculture.:-           l)  Protection.           2)  Subsidies.           S)  State purchase through Import Boards.           4)  Organised marketing.           5) Changing the system of farming as outlined                above.Assuming  that the first two can be ruled out as beingimpossible in the circumstances, the remaining three appearto be feasible and ought to be fully examined.     (10)  Wheat, which before the war had a free market is                                                    now/
now largely controlled by the exporting - countries  and bythe millers in this country.  According to Mr.  Hurst,the author of &quot;The Bread of Britain&quot;, the situation isas follows: -                                              Quarters.British Supply (home farmer)  ......       6,2 0,000Canadian (55 to 60% controlled       wheat pool).................       8,440,000United States (100% controlled       by Farm Board).............       7,067,500Argentine (2 firms control 60 to       70% ).......................       5 ,217 ,500Australia (pools control 50%)  .....       2,709,500Sundries (including Russian con-       trolled by Soviet).........       1,547,500.Of this wheat 40 to 60% is  bought by three large firms,including the Co-operative WHolesale Society.  It is held that for these reasons there is no free market for wheat and the British consumer is subjected to the vagaries of governments, Pools and combinations of firms.  Sooner or later this combined selling control will make combinedbuying .control inevitable if the consumers&apos; interest isto be safeguarded.  But an Import Board, while a means ofself-defence for the consumer, will not necessarily benefit the home producers of cereals to an appreciable extent,unless it has authority and funds to purchase the homecereals at a price equal to or better than the cost ofproduction.  This is the equivalent of a subsidy, but itis inevitable if tho world price is.lower than the Britishcost of production, and if it is desired to maintain graingrowing, for sale in Great Britain.   As wheat,^ barley andoats are largely interchangeable an Import Board would need                           -4-
to control  11 three,  if the experience of the good. Ministryduring the War is. to he taken as a guide.     (11)  It has to be kept in mind that  an Import Board,while stabilising prices and ironing out price-fluctuationscud thereby improving conditions for grain growers, wouldnot tend to maintain arable acreage unless the prices paidto hone growers were appreciably higher than at present.If confined to wheat only,  an Import Board would affectabout l/3rd of the grain growing area of England and about l/EOth of Scotland.     (12)  An alternative ts cn Import Board is a HomePurchasing Beard which would ignore imports and purchaseall home grown cereals at a profitable price te the grower.This is an unconcealed subsidy with no means of spreading the cost of home grown cereals over all cereals as in thecase of an Import Board.   The total -cost  of an additional5/- per Quarter cn Scottish cereals would  amount toill,231,60G.   It also involves the control of flour.   It hasthe advantage that as a quid pro quo better cultivation and improved methods of farming might be insisted upon.     (13)  ii-ny kind of subsidy or artificial stimulus to production is of doubtful utility.   2 policy which takesa long view with the object of encouraging those systems  ofagriculture which are capable ox competing in tire world market is the best in the end for the country, the farmerand the farm labourer, and should have the careful and serious consideration of both the Cabinet  and the Partybefore m agricultural policy is finally decided upon.
(14)   Various suggsstions have  boon made  to meet tho urgent      necessities-of  the situation such  as making      available  to  the  farmers tho funds which may be  spent      on  an  agricultural Unemployment  Insurance Scheme  - but      the amount  of money  that would be  forthcoming by  such an      arrangement is  so trifling  that  it would have little or      no  effect upon  the maintenance of  cultivation, and in                                                    i      my  opinion  it would  be better to announce a general      policy dealing  with  the  facts of the situation. (15)  If  a general  policy  was  outlined in a  speech by  the      Prime  Minister  indicating what the Government was      prepared  to do  in order  to   .ut agaeieulture in the      position  of working  out  its own  salvation I believe      it  would  have an  immediate  beneficial  effect on  the      psychology  of the farmer.   It would at once encourage      him to meet on  moie  even terms the middleman who  has      been responsible  to  a considerable extent for the      recent drop in  oat and potato prices. (16)  The policy  outlined  by the  Pi ime llinister might  include -          (a) A  liarketing Bill  providing  for  the setting             up of  Associations of producers of agricultural             commodities for the  pooling, marking, grading             and  scientifie marketing  of the farm produce;             for  powers to compel a minority of the oroducers             to  come  within the scheme,  and for financial             assistance in the early stages  of the scheme.             The  financial assistance  might  for the most             part take  the form of guarantee to the Banks.             In this  connection it might be  announced  that,             when the organised producers of commodities             such as  potatoes  and oats were  doing everything             reasonable to supply the  home market and  were             threatened by subsidised  or bounty encouraged                    / See appendix.                                  -6-
           imports steps would be  taken for  their  protection           such  as the  imposition  of  a registration  fee  or  control           by licences  of  competing  imports.       (b)  Tho dairy farmers and stock breeders who  are  the           mainstay of  farming suffer heavily from the wide spread           effects of tuberculosis and contagious  abortion.    The           Government (1)  might standardise  and regulate the           manufacture  and sale of tuberculin,  (2) might provide           free   testing for both  diseases for a period  of  years.           By this means the herds of the country  could  be  cleared           of these diseases,  the  cost of production of  milk would  fall,           the demand for  milk would  inorease and  it would  be  possible           to compete with foreign countries in the  manufacture of           milk  products..       (c)  Introduce a  Bill for the  lioensing of Bulks as in Ireland           and other countries and so improve the  quality of           livestock.       (d)  Amend the Agricultural  Holdings Act in  various particulars,           especially in. regard to compensation for  permanent  and           other improvements such as prevision of silos and           installation of electricity,  etc.              Such a policy would  do  much to assist   Scottish   Agriculture and to enable, farmers  to compete on mere  even   terms with foreign and  overseas products.    It  would  give   evidence of the goodwill and intentions of the  Government and   would I  believe open a  new chapter in agricultural development   in Scotland.                                        (Intld.) W.A.Scottish Office,  10th March,  1930.
