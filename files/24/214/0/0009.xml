We have held one meeting, on Tuesday, the 1st July, 1930, when we had under consideration the following papers,  which were circulated to us by directionof the Cabinet:     (a)  Memoranda by the Secretary of State for the Colonies  (OP. 11 (30)), and          CP. 187 (30).    (b)  Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. 186 (30)).    (c)  Memorandum by the Secretary of State for  Foreign Affairs (CP. 205 (30)).    These papers outlined the points of view of the various departments concernedregarding the question of our position in the New Hebrides.                        II. SHORT HISTORICAL NOTE.    2.  Before actually discussing our proposals, it may be useful if we describebriefly the history of pur share in the Government of these Islands.      [21390]
    3.  By a Convention of 1906, which has now. been superseded by a convention of 1914, the New Hebrides were constituted a Condominium under the Joint controlof the British  and French  Governments.   The Government consists partly of a condominium Service under the joint control  of the British and French ResidentCommissioners,  and partly  of independent national services under  the  separatecontrol of the respective Resident Commissioners.    4.  The annual expenditure on the British services  in the New Hebrides metentirely from United Kingdom  funds amounted  in 1929-30 to  11,255, and  theestimated expenditure for the current year is  11,323.  From information available,it is understood that expenditure on French services was about  18,350 in 1927 and 40,000 in 1928; no later figures are available.               III. EXPERIENCE IN WORKING THE  CONDOMINIUM.    5.  We understand that the administration  of the  Group  under the presentsystem of dual  control has proved exceedingly  difficult for a variety of reasons,  themore important of which are :     (a)  Many affairs have to be discussed between London and Paris, which causes          much delay and frequently leads to  unsatisfactory decisions owing to the          necessity of adopting a compromise between two conflicting  views;    (b)  On some matters of  policy there is no accord between the two Governments,          whose systems are often diametrically opposed.    6.  It is, in fact, due to causes under paragraph 5 (b) above that the positionof British settlers has become increasingly precarious, since the French Governmentauthorised  the  importation  of Asiatic labour to  supplement the inadequate localsupplies, while His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have repeatedlyrefused the appeals of their own settlers for a similar  concession.    7.  In 1927 the position was  considered sufficiently  serious to call  for  theappointment of a Commission of Enquiry; this Commission recommended the pro-vision of an adequate supply, at regular intervals, of labour from outside the Group,which they assumed would be effected by the introduction of Chinese labourers under contract.  Although His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Commonwealth and NewZealand were prepared to support such a policy, if it was considered desirable, BisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom  decided that they could not acquiesce in the introduction of Chinese labour into the  New Hebrides.  IV. PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO TRANSFER THE UNITED KINGDOM  SHARE IN THE                                CONDOMINIUM.    8.  In  November  1926 His  Majesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdomproposed to the French Government that, in view of the inherent difficulties in theexisting system of dual control, the Islands should  be partitioned  between  the twocountries;  the  French Government rejected this  idea, however,  which  was  not surprising, in view of the increasing importance of their influence.    9.  In July 1927, it was suggested to the Commonwealth Government that theyshould assume responsibility for British interests in the New Hebrides; they replied,however, that they did not think that the adoption  of this proposal would assist asolution of the  difficulties, and  that, in their view, having  regard to the attitude ofHis Majesty&apos;s  Government in  the United Kingdom towards the labour  problem,renewed  consideration  should be given to the question of  the control of the group,fresh negotiations being instituted with the French.    10.  It was hereupon proposed by His Majesty&apos;s  Government in the UnitedKingdom to His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Commonwealth and New Zealand that,as the French Government were  obviously unwilling to agree to a partition, we shouldsurrender our share in  the islands, subject to certain guarantees,  in return for someterritorial compensation elsewhere in the Pacific.   This suggestion was not, however,acted upon, as the then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs did not think the timefor such a step to be opportune.
                          V. THE PRESENT POSITION.     11.  In January last, the question was raised again by the Secretary of the Statefor the Colonies, in a paper to the Cabinet (CP.  11 (30)), in which, after outlining the past history of our share in the New Hebrides and drawing  attention to thepresent deplorable state into which our interests had fallen, he put forward thefollowing suggestions :      (a) The provision of a new vessel for  the British  Resident Commissioner, at  a           cost of   31,000.     (b) The provision of a British Government Training School, at an initial cost           of  10,000 and a recurring annual cost  of  4,000, to found a  scheme of           native education.     He urged that, as the only alternative appeared  to he withdrawal,  involving,inevitably,  loss  of prestige, an  attempt should be made to rehabilitate  Britishinterests.     12.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer intimated, however, that he was unwilling to provide the necessary money for the benefit of a distant group of islands in whichthe United Kingdom had only a very small  and indirect interest, while the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs  suggested that a solution  might be sought on the linesof proposing that  the New Hebrides be constituted  a Mandated Territory, and that france should be nominated as holder of the mandate.             VI. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS OF PRESENT  DIFFICULTIES.     13.  After  discussing the  present unsatisfactory  state of our position in theNew Hebrides,  we came to the conclusion that the following  courses of action were open to us :        (i)  To maintain the present status quo. This would necessarily  involve  a            part  or the whole of the expenditure proposed by the Secretary of State            for the Colonies, since it is obvious that, if we intend to retain  our            control, we must endeavour to pull  our interests out  of their  present            slough.      (ii)  To make a fresh endeavour to get France to agree to a  partition of the            islands. The previous  attempt in 1927 failed;  since then,  French            interests  have steadily increased at our expense.  It  is hardly likely,            therefore, that  the French  Government will agree  to surrender what            they  are hoping to acquire by peaceful penetration.     (iii)  To invite His Majesty&apos;s Governments  in  the Commonwealth or  New            Zealand to take over our share in  the Condominium. The Common-            wealth Government were unwilling to  do this in 1927,  as they felt that            the substitution of Australian for United Kingdom responsibility would            lead  to a worse position in dealing with differences of opinion with the            French; on the other hand, Australian trade interests in the islands            are greater than those of the United Kingdom  and other parts of the            Empire.      (iv)  To  suggest that  the  islands  be made a  Mandated Territory. This            proposal  would be put forward by us with the  intention that France            should be granted the Mandate over the  whole Group; this would            ensure that  British interests were  safeguarded, although  under the            control of a foreign country.       (v)  To  abandon the  British  share to France  in  exchange  for  another            territory. For the reasons  given in (ii) above, we think it is unlikely            that  the French Government would agree  to such a proposal.      (vi)  To abandon the British share to France unconditionally. Such action            would undoubtedly involve loss of  prestige and would leave  British            subjects and property entirely at the mercy  of the French Government.     14.  We have very carefully  considered  these  possible  solutions  and  their probable reactions.  We feel that, although the British  interest in these  islands is comparatively small, there are certain British obligations towards the Australian orother British settlers and missionaries which cannot altogether be ignored.
    15.  In  view,  however,  of the smallness  of the United Kingdom  interests involved, we  do not feel disposed to recommend the spending of any new capital inthis area, and this, in our view, implies that His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom should be prepared to relinquish its responsibilities altogether.The only means of  achieving this would, in our view, be either (a) for the Govern-ments of the Commonwealth of Australia or New Zealand to take over the british share of the Condominium, or (b) relinquishment of the British share to the French,unconditionally or in the form of a mandate.    16.  We are averse to surrendering the British share to the French Government,if such a course can be avoided, as it must  inevitably give an  impression of our having  been  driven out.  We appreciate the difficulties of Condominium Govern-ment, difficulties which might be enhanced if the  British share was taken over by aGovernment less closely in touch with Paris than  that in London.  Nevertheless, we feel that, in the first place, it would be a much more satisfactory solution if eitherHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth  or His Majesty&apos;s Government in new Zealand would agree to take our place.   Failing this solution,  we think thatthe mandate suggestion should be explored as offering a less unpalatable alternative.                           VII. RECOMMENDATIONS.    17.  Our recommendations may be summarised as follows :     (a) That United Kingdom interests in the New  Hebrides are so small at the          present time that we do not feel justified in recommending the expendi-          ture of any further capital.    (b)  That, in our opinion, the best solution of the present difficulties  would be          for His Majesty&apos;s Government either in the Commonwealth of Australia          or New Zealand to agree to take over our share of the  Condominium; it          is to be observed that Australian interests are greater than those of the          United Kingdom, both because Australia has a larger share of the trade          and because the majority of the British settlers are Australians.    (c)  That this  proposal might  conveniently  be discussed at the  forthcoming          Imperial Conference, and that, in the meantime, the Governments of the          Commonwealth and  New  Zealand might be informed of this suggestion          by cable in  order that their representatives at the  Imperial Conference          may be acquainted with the views of their respective Governments before          sailing  for  England.  If this is not done, it may be difficult  to get  a          definite decision at the time required.    (d)  That, if this proposal should prove impracticable, the suggestion that the          New Hebrides be constituted a Mandated territory under the control of          France  should be explored with the Commonwealth  and New Zealand          representatives; it should be explained to them that, failing this, it would          seem necessary to choose between maintaining the  status  quo,  with the          liability for increased expenditure, and withdrawal in favour of France          on the best terms available.                                          Signed on&apos;behalf of the  Committee :                                               PASSFIELD (Chairman).  2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W. 1,        July 17, 1930.
