THIS document  IS THE PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOvSMMKNT.B3CR.3T.                                           &apos;  COPY NO.   % \P.270(30) .                                  CABINET.                    State  of Trade according to the Reports                      at the Advisory Council meeting  of                              July 9th,  1930.              Memorandum  by the, President of the Board of Trade.            Trade in general continues to be depressed with orders       coming  in slowly and the signs for the immediate future are not       encouraging.            In the coal trade  the June output and export figures are       disturbed by the incidence of holidays, but on  the whole       appear  to show a decline.   Mr. Ridley Warham who has recently       paid a  visit to the Polish (Upper  Silesian) coalfields described       the  powerful nature of  the competition that is  to be expected       from that quarter,  owing to the excellent nature of the coal       deposits,  low wages (though these  have increased in  the last few       years), low railway rates to Danzig and Gdynia  and high prices       obtained  for coal in the Polish home trade.   The p-polish       mineowners expressed satisfaction  at the failure of the British       proposals for a central levy, and  that they were anxious to come       to an arrangement which would put  an end to the present struggle       for  export markets.   This, Mr. Warham pointed  out, could be       attempted if and when the Coal Mines Bill became law.            In iron and steel  the decline persists.   The depression is*       of course,  world-wide and compared with the figures for May, 1929,       the  production of steel in May, 1930, in the six chief producing       countries  showed a  reduction of 21%;  the United Kingdom       reduction  was only  18$  while for the United States and Germany       the  reduction was 24% and 27% respectively.   Prance actually       increased her production and the United Kingdom now ranks only       fourth  in  the steel-making countries of the world.   It was
stated that the importation of 3tsel remains at the same high level and that Continental and Indian pig-iron wa3 giving moretrouble.  It may be convenient here to bring together thosecase3 in which complaint or mention was made cf severe competition from imported goods.  In connection with the importation of pig-iron just mentioned, it was stated that Continental makersendeavoured to dispose of their surplus pig-iron when it i3 notrequired for their own consumption and &quot;Great Britiain i3 theirmoat convenient dumping ground&quot;.  Other complaints of this naturewere in respect of (a) electrical goods, the volume of importsof which was said to be increasing at the rate of  2,000,000per annum, (b) ready-made doors from Germany which are coming inat very low prices oTing to the break-down of price-fixingagreements, (c) foreign hosiery, the continued and increasingimportations cf which ars\complained of, especially in cottonstockings and fancy good3, (d) rubber boots and shoes which, it is stated, are being imported from foreign countries in lar^equantities at absurdly low prices.     On the other hand it may be noted that the wool workersrepresentative pointed out that the proportion of importedgocd3 retained in the home market does not appear to be anygreater than before the war.     Complaint of tariff 3 against United kingdom exports was limited to a reference by the wool workers&apos; representative tothe further increases in the Australian tariff as likely to limit our wool exports to quality goods, and to the new UnitedStates Tariff.     Shipbuilding ha3 been somewhat more active and severalorders have bec-n received for special types of vessel but nonefor ordinary tramps.  Thi3, of course, reflects the generalshipping position where there has been no sensible reduction mthe amount of tonnage laid up.  As regards the immediateprospects for shipping it was reported that the Canadian wheat
4^&apos;  problem remains unsolved, the holding policy proving    unprofitable for the time being, while in the United States    the Farm Board have lost heavily but are still advising    farmers not to sell though the price is still falling and    the new crop coming in.  Large quantities of wheat are    expected in Russia owing to the greatly increased use of    tractors in cultivation.   Australia  is still increasing her    acreage and India is offering supplies continuously:  only in    the -argentine would there appear to be a prospect of anything    like deficient supply.         In the electrical Industry there is, on the whole, no    expansion,  but the industry had been able to keep their    employees as there was a prospect of better times.         In the motor industry manufacturers are, generally    speaking, working only half-time though the export position    appears to be somewhat more promising.         The chemical industry remains at an extremely low level.         In spite of the efforts of the American Farm Relief Beard    the price of American cotton fell during the month from about    8d. a lb. to just over 7d.   Prices have fallen also in Egypt    and Bombay,  These falls have had a depressing effect on the    cotton trade which remains cn the whole poor.  The boycott in    India ha3 resulted in an almost complete cessation of business    with that countr-, and the fall of silver has had a similar    effect with regard to China.  Things are, however, more    promising in the Middle and Near East and the home trade has    been better.  In connection with the Indian market for cotton    piece goods the need for continued variety was remarked upon    even if a measure of standardisation should be introduced.    The n9W Report has, however, introduced a hopeful element    because it shows that to a certain extent unsuccessful    working has been due to lack of up-to-date organisation and    there is a measure -of agreement&apos; that this can be rectified.
4f&quot; The Report has yet to be carefully studied in all interested   quarters.        flaw wool prices have dropped back almost to last March   levels and there is still general depression though for the   British industry there are the encouraging features of cheap raw   material hardly likely to fall further in price, and stocks of   manufactured goods are low though the arrears in tops have   already been made up.  Recent reductions in wages Make competition   with foreign countries more possible.  Severe reorganisation   is in progress in the dyeing and finishing sections.        In retail trade  Jest End Stores showed general depression   especially in furniture and hardware, and suburban stores showed   a slight increase.  The Co-operative figures were vitiated for   comparative purposes by the incidence of Whitsuntide, but   savings with Co-operative Societies continued to increase.   Wholesale prices tend still to fall.        Railway traffics for the first half year show a general   decline of 3-g-/*, those for ooal and coke being 5/o and for   passenger traffic 2-370.  The decline at the mement is much greater   and appears to be increasing.  Railway shop activities are down   by 27$.        Unemployment increased by 120,000 between May 26th and   June 30th, the increase consisting almost entirely in persons   temporarily stopped, and in the Northern Divisions coal and   cotton being the Industries chiefly  afflicted.  Southern   England &quot;-hows an improvement of 11,000 for the month.        In the Money Market the discrepancy between Market Bill   Rates and the Official rate disappeared for the first time this   year early in June* and the New York Federal Reserve Rate was   reduced from 3/c to  the record low level of 2f/i  cn June 19th, but   the consequent tendenoy tovards a lower Bank Rate here wa3   checked by heavy drawings by French bank3 upon  their foreign
Board of Trade.  25th July,  1930.balances in the shape cf gold transfers to  the bank of France.This has reduced the Bank cf England gold reserves to 156,000,000 a figure which is,  however, causing no anxiety.
CONFIDENTIAL.Meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council          Wednesday. 9th July. 1950.                         BANKING.     MR. G00DSN0UGH:   kr. Chairman, I shall he very brief,because there has been little change, since the last meeting,in connection with monetary natters, and Is ee that on theteb le all the figures and points of interest, so f ar as they relate to this country, are set out.     There are two important changes which have taken placeabroad;  that is to say the New York Federal Reserve bank rate has been reduced from 3 per cent,  to 2^ per cent.  sincethe last meeting;  that is, I believe,  the lowest rate on record since the establishment of the Federal Reserve System.In Berlin, the Bank rate has been reduced from 4-g- per cent.to 4 per oent.     I think on the last occasion I mentioned that therehad been some hardening of the Market discount rate here,but rates have now fallen back, probably because the previoushardening in the rate brought more money here.  As regardsthe gold position, France has secured practioally all thegold in the open market that has been offered since the last meeting, and the Bank of England hAs lost on balance 833,420 according to the published daily statements.     The reports that I receive from the branches ofBarclays Bank in various parts of the country are depressing,so far as trade goes.  Yesterday I had a lengthy conversationwith some South Wales coal people, and as I believe there isnobody representing South Wales here today, I beg leave to mention this, although perhaps it is rather out of myprovince.  They told me that, if they could find work forthree days or possibly four days per week per man, that wasthe most they could manage.  In the other heavy industries I think things have shown no improvement sinco our last meeting, and orders seem to be coming along very slowlyindeed.  The same applies in all the smaller trades, the retail trades, and so forth.  The interval since our last meeting is a brief one, and naturally at this time of theyear there is a good deal of holiday making going on and business is slack.COAL.     MR. RIDLEY WARHAM:   The output cf coal in the UnitedKingdom for the three weeks ended June 21st was as under:Week ended June 7th, 4,705,000 tons;  week ended June 14th,2,724,000 tons (includes Whitsuntide);  week ended June 21st,4,594,000 tons.  The average output for the 13 weeks endedJune 21st was 4,616,000, as compared with 4,815,000 tons forthe corresponding period last year, a decrease of over2,500,000 tons over the period.  (Both periods includeWhitsuntide and Easter).  The average number of personsemployed in the industry for the 13 weeks ended June 21stwas 939,300 as compared with 938,100 for the correspondingperiod last year, but for the week ended June 21st the numberhad fallen to 918,800, or 21,000 less.  Unemployment for themonth of May was 22.1 per cent, as compared with 16.6 percent, in April and 21.9 per cent, average of 1928.  The
1 9 9X O wexport of coal from the United kingdom (excluding Irish FreeState) in Lay was 4,655,661 tons, as compared with 4,227,419tons in April (April included Easter).  The value per ton.o.h in Kay was 18s.6d.  as against 16s.7d. in April.     Polish exports for May were 654,000 tons, an increase of61,000 over April.  In the year 1929 she exported &quot;by sea7,624,000 tons and in the first four months of this year2,536,000 tons, whereas down to 1925 she did not export asingle ton.  The depression in the coal trade continues,and  I  confirm   what Ivir. Good enough said with regard tothe short working of our own collieries at the moment;  wehave settled down for some time now to three days a week.  Ihave just returned from a visit to Poland.  I learnt from my visit to the ports of Danzig and Gdynia that there would be nodifficulty in equipping those ports to deal with a very much larger export of coal than is being dealt with at present.They have come to nothing like the limit of their resources and they are expanding and will increase to a very considerable extent.  The only difficulty might be the question of finance.It was made clear to us that the Polish Government, by thefinancial policy of their railways, had in fact put the UpperSilesian collieries upon the seaboard.  V/e felt that the work that had been done upon the national harbour of Gdynia had nowdeeply involved the Polish national pride in making the harbour a complete and conspicuous success, and that theywould make very serious sacrifices, if such were necessary,to ensure maintaining and increasing the volume of tradepassing through the port.  The visit to the Upper Silesianmines afforded many new ideas.  \/e knew that the geologicalconditions, both as regards depth, quality of coal, and height of seams, were very good.  They were even bettor than those of us who had not been in the district before had realised, andthe roof conditions, gradients, etc., were also found to bevery favourable.  The equipment of those mines which wevisited was good, but no better than our own equipment.  Sofar as the underground work was concerned, there was not nearly so much machinery, but machinery was not so necessary, partly because of the excellent conditions, and partly because of thelow wa^es of the men employed.  i/e gathered that there were very large reserves of coal in thick and easily worked seams,potential coal;   enough to last for hundreds of years.  Thequality of the steam coal is excellent, and does not compare unfavourably with best South Yorkshire.  It.is this coal whichis exported from Danzig and Gdynia.  There is also some gasand coking coal which is not so good as British coal of this class.   It appeared that there were various things they wouldlike to spend money on in the way of improved machines and soon, but that there was a good deal of financial stringency andthat taxation was very heavy.  One company informed us thatthey had made a profit of 3^ million zloty in 1929, but thatafter paying taxation only 1^ million was left.  Withoutfurther information it would perhaps be unwise to put too muchstress upon this point.   The lolish Selling Combinations havea convention which divides up the trade and fixes prices for supplies to Poland and sales by rail to other european countries.  This arrangement apparently does not hold goodwhen it comes to selling for export, when competition betweenthe different groups is very severe.  The possibility ofPoland doing a seaborne export trade at all depends upon thelaw rates charged by the Polish State -rtailways.  The totalcost of putting a ton of coal from Upper Silesia f.o.b atDanzig or Gdynia appears to be about 5s,, of which 3s.4d. is
 the cost of railway carriage and labour, a journey of 380 to400 miles.  It was admitted that this charge did not cover the extra out of pocket expenses over and above the charges which would have to be met in any case, even if the coal traffic was not there.  The railways as a whole are said tobe working at a profit, and it did not appear that the low rates on the coal traffic were a serious burden to the State,whatever they might be to the other traffic which has to payhigher rates on that account.  The low prices at which coal for export can be sold depend upon a triple effect of the low wages which satisfy the Polish workmen!  (l) The low wages in the mines, together with the high rate of production per shift, enables the coal to be got at a low wages cost, (2) The low wages in other industries enables these industries to pay a high price for the coal which is supplied to them, thus providing a high rate of profit per ton upon the coal sold in Poland itself;  and (3; the low rate of wages upon therailways alone makes possible the low freight charges made bythe Government.  The workers are Homan Catholics, and are, wewere constantly told, very religious.  It was explained to us that this on the whole made thorn very contented.  So far as wecould see they seemed to be healthy and clean and they lookedwell nourished.  The real necessities of life are very cheap,and they have never become accustomed to any sort of luxury.The children, we thought, looked particularly well, and thehousing conditions in many places appeared to be quite good.Even though the pits were working short time we should nothave supposed from the appearance of the people that they wereearning less than half the wages that are earned in coalmining districts in Sngland.  While we came to the conclusion that Silesian mines under present conditions had a considerable advantage in competition with the export trade of this country,and that there was no reason why those conditions should not continue, we found tliat the leaders of the Polish mine owners were anxious to come to some arrangement which would put anend to the present fight for trade in the export markets, andwould enable everybody to get a higher price for their coal.They would be willing parties to an agreement between theexport nations were such an agreement found to be possible.Though we did not go to Poland officially representing any partof the British coal trade, we were invited to meet therepresentatives of the Upper Silesian trade.  Mr.Alfred Palter,General ZUrektor of the Robur Syndikat, was in the chair, and took the principal part in the discussion.  He made it clear to us that they were in a very strong position, particularlyIn view of the failure of the British scheme for a centrallevy,at which failure they did not attempt to disguise theirsatisfaction.  He stated that, in their experience, thoughcompetition could ruin a mine owner it could not permanentlyclose a mine, and that therefore British competition would continue to be a factor in their trade.  He was thereforeanxious to come to terms which would enable them to secure areasonable amount of export trade at remunerative pricesrather than a larger amount at prices which showed no profit.I replied that nothing could be done until we knew the resultof the Coal Mines Bill, and that if it became an Act in itspresent form a committee would be set up which would have thepower to deal with such matters.  It was pointed out that itwould be necessary to bring in Germany and Holland and possiblyPrance and Belgium.  Mr.  Palter was of the opinion that aconsiderable amount of time would have to be spent in prelim-inary conversations and that it was of no use for any one country to put forward a cut and dried scheme, even as a basis for discussion.  I gave it as my personalfeeling that itwould be desirable to make a real attempt to come to some
understanding between the exporting nations of the world,  hutsaid that I thought it undesirable to do anything at all until there was some authority in England competent to deal with thesubject.  I should like to say that we had the very greatesthelp from the British Consul in Danzig, Mr. Bernays, whoarranged that we should meet the Minister of Commerce and thePresident of the Senate of that city;  and also from Mr. Rossthe Vice-Consul at Katowice.   Both these gentlemen seemed tobe men of ability, and they took endless pains to assist usin every possible way.     I am afraid we came back rather depressed as this trade would appear a very serious factor in the foreign competition.     (At this point Mr. W.B.  Smith. M.P., Parliamentary        Secretary, took the chair.)     SIR HUGO HIRST:  May I ask what is the nationality ofthe miners in that district?  Are they German or Polish?     MR. RIDLEY WARHAM:  Partly German and partly Polish,  butthey have taken the nationality   those who were living inor were born in Upper Silesia have remained Polish, because S ilesia is now Polish, and having been born in what is nowPoland they become Poles.  One of the principal mine owners wespoke to was a German, but he is now a Pole, although stronglyGerman in his own ideas all the same.     SIR HUGO HIRST:  They are all German or Russian.     MR. RIDLEY WARHAM:  A great many are.  Mr. PaCLter is not,and he is General Director of the Union of Coal Owners, butthey really have a number of extremely able men acting aslabourers, partly Poles, although quite a number of them areGerman.     MR. PUGH:  On the point of wages, sir, I should like toknow if there is any information as to the present purchasingpower of wages as compared with pre-war?     MR.  RIDLEY WARHAM:  It is very difficult to get thatexactly, Mr. Pugh, but I think the Department has those things to some extent already.  We made a good many enquiries as tothe cost of living and how the working men lived on these low wages, and we were told that house rents are very low in thecountry, and that the necessaries of life, bread, butter and vegetables grown in the country, also meat, are cheap;  the meat, they said, cost about 9d. or lOd. a lb, but anything that is imported is extremely dear, especially fruit:  bananascost lOd. each and oranges 6d.  Clothes are very dear indeed.We were told some people went to Germany in a motor car with only an overcoat on and came back with a full rig-out.  Thepeople are not accustomed to luxuries and are quite happy,although they are only getting about half the money that our people are getting.     CHAIRMAN:  The Poles do claim that their wages are stillincreasing.     MR. RIDLEY VARHAK:  They have increased since I was therethree years ago.  At that time one of the coal mines I was atbelonged to the same company as that which I descended this time, and the average wages per person employed amounted to3s.2d. to 3s.3d. per shift;  now it is more or less 4s.3d.to 4s.6d.
     SIR HUGO HIRST:  The electrical industry is in some ofits departments still keeping up quite well.   In heavyengineering it is keeping up well in all those sections whichbenefit by the Grid Scheme (high tension switch gears and big-units) but in the smaller units and industrial motors the electrical industry is suffering in common with the basic industries, the mines, steel, etc.5 and other industries.  Inthe &quot;smaller appliances of the electrical industry there isconsiderable work, but there is no progress since last year;in fact the natural progress in the industry amounting to or 10 per cent, per annum, is wiped out, and we are strugglingto keep up to last year&apos;s business, and we have not quitesucceeded.  On that side of the Tjusiness the e ver&quot;increasingimports are troubling us.  There have been-about  2,000,000additional imports per annum and they are affecting that lineof industry considerably.  As regards export, the industry hasbeen successful in getting a few big orders placed according tothe papers, but those reports are generally misleading.  I read..yesterday, for instance, of my company having obtained nearly a million pound contract with India.  Well, that may be amillion to the contract in India, but the work that- is passed through the shops in Great Britain is less than SS0,000oThose articles are very often misleading and give a wrongimpression.  There have been received from Uew Zealand andother over-sea countries a few ;.aticfactory contracts whichhelp us at the present time, but we see nothing coming in theimmediate future.  That is in a few words, the principalposition in the electrical industry.  Some of the sectionssuch as the cable and telephone section with its development in wireless and talkie films are all going on fairly wellcompared with other industries, but we are not progressing atthe moment, but we see the chance when things are gettingbetter of pulling our weight again satisfactorily, but on thewhole we have not had to dismiss people.  V/e are employingmore people than we did two years ago, and not less than v/eemployed last year.MOTOR INDUSTRY.     SIR Y/ILLIAM MORRIS:  The motor industry in the home marketat any rate is still feeling the consequences of the general trade depression.  While the end. of June normally shows aslackening of production, there is no doubt that this year itis more serious than usual, and general employment conditionsin the Midland area are in a somewhat serious state.  Broadly,it may be said that many manufacturers are only working halftime.  The export position, however., appears to be s omewhatmore promising, and even if tfcia also reflects the general depression existing in ail markets the British Manufacturersgenerally are obtaining a greater share of total registrationsthan at any time since the war.  It really means thatregistrations are not ac great, but have shown a better per--centace, although that does not indicate large sales, but rather shows that the foreigners&apos; sales are also depressed.In most branches of the commercial vehicle trade output appearsto be maintained compared with the similar period of 1929,whilst so far as private car production is concerned output would probably be 10 per cent less than at the same time lastyearc  There are certainly fev/ signs, under existing-conditions, of any improvement in the near future.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.
CHEMICALS.     MR. KILL:  It is regrettable to be compelled to reports., ain that the state of the chemical markets, without importantexce-ption in any section, remains at an extremely low level.Exports of chemicals have been poor, and the heavy chemicalsection has accounted for more than its usual share in the decrease of shipments.  On the imports side there is also areduction in the total, but important items - drugs inparticular - entered in increasing quantities.  It was possiblelast month to maintain that prices had not suffered appreciablyunder the extended strain of reduced demand.  According to current quotations this position would appear to be continued,but actual prices realised show some falling away.  Dyes and intermediate products are dulls and inactivity in the fabricsindustries is causing some concern, as no improvement in theimmediate future ia anticipated.  In fact analysis by sectionsof the industry brings to li^ht little which is not coveredby these general statements,,  One item among coal tar products,namely, refined tar for road building purposes, is comparativelylively, and a continuance of present weather conditions will maintain the position for this commodity - a position which is all the more valuable in view of the acute state of markets for other coal tar products.INDIAN TRADEc     MRe LINDSAY;  I have  just received, the static tics on trade for the month of May, and I think I had better quotethese figures, because they show the effect of the presentslump in the prices of raw materials for Indian exports.  let me take the imports side first.  Durin^ the last three months,March, Aoril and May, the  imports into India were 515,000,000, 13,000,000 and  13,000,000, a very slight falling off;  infact, curiously enough, April and May are practically thesame figure.  The corresponding figures for exports during march, April and May, were  21,000,000,  18,000,000 and ;16,000,000, a distinct falling off, and of course verjrlargely due to the falling prices for raw materials.  Withregard to exports from India to this country -there is a veryslight sign of recovery in manganese.  For months past wehave been severely suffering from Russian competition, and weare never told what price  Russian manganese is going to be sold at from one week to another.  All they seem keen on doingis to sell manganese at a  shade less than anybody else.  As I say, there has been some slight recovery recently.  Our raw cotton sales to Lancashire are greater than they have been formany years past;  in fact  I should not be surprised ii the season&apos;s figures at the end oi this month show a completerecord for the sales of Indian cotton to Lancashire,Fortunately most of our raw materials are non-competitive withthose produced in this country, but there is one outstandingexception, and that is pig iron,  I have had many complaints of Indian pig iron coming  to this country, and all I can sayis that we are selling as  best we can.  In regard to pig iron^e are particularly threatened at the moment by an.agreement which the Japanese are understood to have made for the purchaseof iron ore from Australia.  Hitherto they have relied chieflyon India for their supply  in pig form, and now they are goingto encourage their smelting operations by importing ore, andif that means a decrease in our pig-iron trade with Japan weshall have to sell where we can0  I do not in the ordinary
117It) 1course come mud;, into contact with the outward trade fromhere to India, hut I met the other day somebody  .who knowsthe Indian cotton piece goods market ver;  well, and who is intouch with the present situation.  I should like to repeat hisremarkss but to point out that be was not referring in what hesaid in any way to the present boycott, but rather to thegeneral conditions in the cotton piece goods markets in India.As you knows there are three distinct strands of the trade.There is the local mill which supplies generally the lowerclass of piece goods;  then you have the demand for Manchestergoods;  and in between the two, like a wedge, comes theJapanese trade, which competes on the one hand with India in quality and on the other hand with Manchester in price.  Nowsmy friend pointed out that the Japanese have made tremendousstrides so far in the standardisation of piece goods, and thatthere is a strong movement at present in favour of a similareffort in Lancashire.  At the same time he was not at allcertain that Lancashire was not right in maintaining her policyof producing&apos; hundreds of different varieties of cloth, for ofall commodities cotton cloth ought not to be standardisedbecause it is human nature to desire variety.  The success of lancashire has always depended on her turning out an infinitevariety of cotton cloth,&apos; and he thought that&apos; as soon aspurchasing power returned to India one would find a return tothe old demand for varieties of cloth:  varied output helpsthe trade in two directions.  The individual wants distinctionin dress from that of his neighbours.  Secondly the pettyretailer wants to be able to produce to his intending customera cloth which is not stocked by other retailers;  which means,of coursej an infinite variety of different types, a tendencywhich cuts clean across the present movement towardsstandardisation.  He said that possibly for India the solution might be a standardisation of varied types;  that is to say,you would find an attempt perhaps on the part of Manchester tostandardise new patternsj new types of cloth, and fix themevery year, and then introduce a new variety of standards thefollowing year.  Possibly by that means one might come back tothe old conditions under whioh India bought her cotton clothregularly once a year.WOOL,     MR. HAMILTON:  Mr.  Chairman, the Whitsuntide holidays -proved to be the turning point in the Textile Strike^ for onthe re-opening of the mills the workers turned up in con-siderable numbers.  Since that time, there has been a steadydrift back to work, and at the end of the month the only sectionwhich ijtill held out against the hacmillan rates was theSociety of Power Loom Overlookers.  Whether this prolongeddispute has resulted in the transfer of business to othermarkets is questionable.  Oertainly the firms not involved inthe strike do not appear to have benefited b3r any increase inorders.  bpeaking generally, the v/ool textile industry *&apos;throughout the world is in a ver  depressed state.  I have just returned from france and Italy, and t fou.nd then also com-plaining very biuterly about the state oi the wool-trj.de.   Theycomplain  for very much less reason than we do, because If theyare not running 30 per cent of their capacity they considerthey are in a depressed state.  Of course wages are lower in france, and even more so in Italy, and their exports are increasing very considerable&apos;.  Trices of raw materials havedropped back almost to the level of last March.  There are,however, encouraging features In the situation which should not
loobe overlooked.  Raw material is cheap, stocks of manufacturedgoods are very low, and the recent reductions in wages makescompetition with foreign countries more possible.  Whilst agreat and permanent improvement in the industry is hardlyto be anticipated, it may confidently be expected that thelatter half of the year will see an increased machineryactivity in every branch of the trade,     SIR HUGO HIRST:  You speak of the exports increase inthe case of France and Italy.  Do you mean exports in generalmarkets? or imports into this country?     MR, HAMILTON:  Into this countr &apos; and other countries.I am not talking about recent months, but generally since 1920there has been a considerable increase in that clirec-tlon.GAS INDUSTRY AND chemicals,     SIR D, MILKS Y/ATSOE:  Mr. Chairman, in regard to tar, thedemand for road tar remains very good, and this year It islikely there will be a record use of tar on the roads inc-:-reat Britain, partlyr due to the line weather we have beenexperiencing lately, and partly owing to the low price of taras compared with, the prices charged for bitumen,  with regardto creosote, the exports of creosote to America continue onthe same scale as last year, and the price remains steady.With regard to pitch, the stocks of pitch unfortunatelycontinue to increase more rapidly in this country, and thereis a serious phase of the situation, notwithstanding aconsiderable reduction in the production of pi tch from coke-ovens owing to the stagnation in the iron and steel trades.     In regard to sulphate of ammonia, the production ofthis unfortunately vastly exceeds the demand, due of course to the great increase in synthetic sulphur plants all overtie world.  There has unfortunately been a reduction of20,000 tons in the use of sulphate in this country this year,equal to about 10 or 11 per cent decrease in the consumption;this is largely due to the agricultural depression at thepresent moment, and that notwithstanding a very low price.There has been a better demand, I am gl d to say, in spain and China, but on the other hand one of our most importantmarkets, Japan, is showing a decrease owing to the productionlocally in Japan of sulphate of ammonia, which is likely toincrease.  The price of sulphate of ammonia has now fallen to56,1,0 per ton, which compares with the price of  12 per ton-Dre-war.  As regards costs of production, coal costs more,labour costs more, and sulphuric acid costs more, and you can see what a serious position it is, not only for gas under-taking s, but also for the coal trade and the coke ovens, whichproduce very large quantities, and in a great many cases now the position is  so bad that instead of sulphate being a very good source of revenue to the manufacturer It is actually adead loss;  unforti\nately it must be made,  \fe cannot put it into the drain becauce it v/ill pollute the river, and there-fore it has to be marulactured, and instead of a revenue now,most of us are making an actual dead loss.-S-
IRON AMD STSEI..     MR. PUGIi:  Mr. Chairman, I will put in a short note,hut otherwise it is unnecessary for me to t ake up the timeof the Committee, except to say that the position, with theexception of the tinplate trade, whioh barely holds its own,is that the general conditions and the general prospects inthe iron and steel industry are worse than they were.     The following statement was handed in:  Conditions inthe industry are still very unsatisfactory and depressing.Reports show that there is a general complaint of scarcity oforderso  In the pig-iron trade stocks are accumulating inall districts and the number of furnaces in blast is likelyto be further reduced.  In Scotland only 25 furnaces arenow operating as compared with 23 at the end of April.  Thereis practically no change in ths heavy steel section of theindustry to report upon.  In the wroixght iron trade the onlyfirms who, comparatively speaking, appear to be doing steadywork, are those engaged on producing Staffordshire markedbars;  on the other hand, nut and bolt iron is in poor demand and mills are working short time.   It would seem that thereis a very slight slackening in the tinplate trade, but the steel sheet trade shows no change;  many mills are still idleand the demand is insufficient to keep others fully occupied.SHIPPING.     SIR ERNEST GLOVLiR:  Mr. Chairman, I have very little to report in the shipping position in any direction,  the freight Index number for June shows a slight improvement,but is still 22 per cent below the average of 1913.  InCanada the hoped-for development has not taken place, and business is still on a minimum basis both as to quantity andfreights.  From the Argentine it is reported the market hasfluctuated, but there nas been no material improvement.  Asregards Cuba, the rates for sugar whilst not fallingmaterially show no upward trend.  With regard to India thedecline in exports has been further accentuated.  This isdue partly to world-wide depression, other contributingfactors being (a) the effect of the monsoon, and (b) thepolitical situation, and in particular the effort to boycottBritish goods.  The agitators are not only trying to boycottBritish goods, but also shipment by British steamers.  Theexport of cement is continualljr diminishing, owin;v to thefact of Indian production and keen competition of Japan,which is undercutting the British price by over 3s.Od. acask.  Homewards, there has been a slight improvement on theWest side, owin  to shipment of wheat from Karachi.  Rateshowever are quite unremunerative.  Prom Calcutta there is agreat dearth of cargo, re ular line steamers leaving with-half cargoes,  AS regards Easo Africa, business is fairlywell maintained, though regular ships do not obtain fullcargoes either out or home.  South Africa has not developedany new features.  So far as Australia is concerned, therestriction of imports is, ofcourse, having a serious effect,and there is no  .improvement to report homewards.  Outwardcoal freights are scarce and rates have a downward tendency.Shipbuilding has been more active, and contracts placed duringthe month Include two 15,000-ton paseen&amp;er and cargo steamers,
two 205000-ton whalers, one large and one small  tanker,  twomedium-sized colliers9  and three or four other vessels forspecial services.   No orders have been placed, as  far as I know,for ordinary overseas tramps.   With regard to laid-up tonnage,whilst no definite increase has been reported, no  materialdecrease has taken place during the month, and the figure for1st July is, if anything, higher than that for 1st April.COTTON.     SIR KENNETH STEWART:   Mr. Chairman, there is nothinggood to report on the Cotton position during June, so far asexports are concerned.  The East and Far East have put throughthe minimum possible quantity of business.  South America isnot so bad and West Africa was fairly normal.  Home and Colonialtrades are at a &apos;between season&apos; stage, and are not inclined to purchase heavy quantities.     The most important event has been the publication of theCotton Report, which is being eagerly studied in Lancashire.I think I may say that many responsible leaders of the cotton trade approve of the Report and are determined to carry outthe recommendations,  At the same time its reception in manyof the cotton towns seems to be rather mixed.  If you wouldlike a few comments on the Report, I may say one thing about it is especially marked; it 1B very brief.  To my mind it isvery fair, and it certainly has avoided with great skill manyof the pitfalls that people are apt to fall into when they get on to the cotton trade, even after some close study.  Theprincipal marked feature about it to my mind is this:  it seemsto indicate pretty clearly that a certain amount of the failureof the cotton trade to meet post-war  conditions has been caused by the lack of modern and up-trO-date organisation and methods in Lancashire.   That is rather a hopeful note, beoauseit means that this sort of thing can be put right,, and I think there are a number of people in Lancashire who are workingalong the line of trying to get that organisation put on abetter basis.  It is rather too early to say very much aboutthe steps that are going to be taken to meet the various recommendations, but it is a matter that is being studied very closely at present,     ALDERMAN TITTERING-TON:  I would like to ask if the questionof finishing and dyeing in the trade comes within the survey of the Report,     SIR KENNETH STEWART:   Yes, everything is given in theReport.  There is a very well written paragraph about every single stage:  labour, finishing, merchanting.     ALDERMAN TITTERINGTON:  YOU have no particular remarks tomake at this stage as regards that particular section?     SIR KENNETH STEWART:   No.  I think on that side thoReport sums up the circumstances exceedingly well.  It says inthe Report that the depression in the trade cannot be put downto that fact alone, because the largest loss has not been Inthe finishing side at all.     ALDERMAN TITTERINGTON:  I was familiar with that, but i thought perhaps your personal observations might have had some---------
lil     SIR KENNETH STEWARTt   The Cotton trade Report was correctIn ita summary.   Prloea for small  individual orders of dyed and finished goods are not unreasonable.    The want of flexibilityand insufficient consideration of the claims of long runs of lowquality goods have done damage in the past and require very special consideration in the future.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.     MR. SANDERSON:  As a result of further good rains inAustralia the position is somewhat better, although the Western&apos;?art of New South Wales has not benefited so much as the others. t is estimated,that the wool clip for 1930/31 will be2,728,000 bales.    The Wheat Marketing Bill (second reading)was defeated in the Senate.   Good rains have fallen in NewSouth Wales. Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and will benefit wheat areas, and light showers in south-west Western Australia.   The  exports this season have been 31,345,000bushels compared  with 70,357,429 last season.   Flour exportsthis season 252,409 tons compared with 330,560 last season, andthe estimated acreage of wheat sown for season 1930/31 is17 million acres*     In regard to wine, the 1930 Australian vintage estimates are for New South Wales 2,100,000 gallons, victoria 1,250,000,Queensland 60,000, South Australia 12,250,000, West Australia350,000, or a total of 15,985,000 gallons, a decrease of2,600,000 compared with last year.     Towards the  Commonwealth Loan which is being floated inAustralia,  4,000,000 have already been subscribed and theFederal Budget is now before the House of Representatives at canberra.     Work in the  Coal Mines has been resumed in the Newcastledistrict, under the recent arrangement.   At Broken Hill severalmines are closing down as a result of very low prioes of metal.     The Fuller Brush Company announces its intention to erecta factory in Australia.     MR. CAIRNS:   At the moment our shipments of dried fruit from australia have been impeded by want of transport, and it iareported to ua that sinoe the recent increase of import duties in Australia, the inooming freight has been considerably reduoed,and, of course, it would be impraotioable to send out ships in ballast for the homeward bound&quot; cargo.   Do you think tttere iaanything in that?     MR. SANDERSON:  Well, Sir Ernest Glover could tell you moreabout this than I oan.   It is out of the question to expectships to go out in ballast in order to bring home oar go.     SIR ERNEST GLOVER:  I should have thought the fruit would come by the regular line steamers, as a tramp steamer nevercarries fruit from Australia.   I have not heard that there hasbeen any reduction in the liner freight from and to australia or whether they are coming through free of cargo.   I am afraidI have not got any speciflo information on this, but one can easily get it.   *s it something quite reoent?

     MR. CAIRNS:  From the reports made by our buyers,Mr. Chairman, there is no doubt that the dried fruit is  notcoming here freely.     MR. SANDERSON:  Is not that a question of price, Sir?     MR. CAIRNS:  Ho,  The fruit is there and bought. What  Imention is only a report, and I was just wondering whether there was any foundation for it or not.     CHAIRMAN:  Of course it might possibly result fromrestriction of imports at the other end, but according to whatSir Ernest Glover says, the tramp class of ships are hardlyaffected in that way;  it is the passenger and liner vessel.     SIR ERNEST GLOVER:  It would be easy to clear that  up from the Liner Companies;  the Australian liners are acomparatively small group, and it would be easy to ascertain what their explanation is.     MR, CAIRNS:  It is not very important, but I thought Iwould raise the point,     SIR ERNEST GLOVER:   Could you give any date?     MR, CAIRNS:  I got the report last week,     CHAIRMAN:  From the information received perhaps an investigation can be made which might be helpful in the  matter^to see if there is any difficulty which can be overcome.     MR. WALKER:  Do you know whether the prices of wool have decreased or only of mutton?     MR. SANDERSON:  Not to that extent.COTTON.     MR.  LENNOX LEE:  I have nothing further to say,  Sir,except what is in the short review which I have put in.   This was  aa follow.&apos;;:-Prices of raw cotton during the monthhave again shown weaker tendencies and with prospects of a heavy crop of American cotton have dropped from about 8d. per lb.. to just over 7d. per lb,, whilst Egyptian futures have alsolost approximately Id. per lb.  On the other hand, Egyptianspot prices in Liverpool and O.L.F, Alexandria have remainedfirm as a result of the action of the Egyptian Government in holding back the remainder of the old Crop.     The fall in the raw cotton market has had a depressing effect upon yarns which have been in poor demand and prices have continued unremunerative.     In the piece goods branch of the industry no improvementcan be reported.   Falling prices have discouraged buyers in allmarkets.  The bookings for India and China have again beenvery disappointing and with silver below 15-g-d per ounce anybusiness which might have been done with the latter country has been rendered impossible.  The boycott in India hasresulted in an almost complete cessation of business with thatMarket.  The news from the Near and Middle East is more
reassuring,  &quot;Homally this time of the year is quiet so faras Egypt is concerned but as stocks are not unduly largethere is some prospect for the future.   Abundant crops are reported in Turkey and it is hoped that thiswill he the fororuwwfcr. of a revival of business in thatcountry,  Russian competition in Persia and Baghdad hasabated somewhat and more business is reported.   In South and central America business on the whole has continued quiet.The exchange position in the Argentine has had a retardinginfluence on the import trade although with an improvedagricultural outlook the prospects are considered brighter.The  ian Paulo Coffee Loan has led to a more optimisticfeeling In regard to Brazil but until stocks of coffee are considerably reduced no great improvement in the import ofcotton piece goods can be looked for.     The finishing trades have reflected the conditions whichhave been ruling in the other sections of the industry during june,  The output in the Bleaching Trade is reported to havebeen considerably less than during the same period last yearand the quantity of cloth coming forward shows a marked de-crease.  Go far as dyed piece goods are concerned the overseastrade has been unsatisfactory but the home demand, particular-ly for twills and pocketinge, has maintained a satisfactorylevel.  Production in the Printing section appears to havebeen the lowest on record.  Man;?- firms closed their works for an extended holiday at Whitsuntide and very few were ableto avoid a considerable amount of short time working.   the almost complete interruption of business with India was, ofcourse, one of the chief causes, but in addition there was ageneral lack of confidence in almost every market.  The home trade was the only bright feature but even here conditions were by no means uniform.     MR. II.W. LEE:  In regard to trade in general there isunder the circumstances an atmosphere which one might call ashade optimistic.  I am afraid that I do not find any market in this country that is of any  mse whatever at the presenttime, and I do not think there is mox^e trade coming in than would keep roughly 50 per cent, of the machinery going.  I am afraid we cannot look for any reasonable improvement until theautumn, and then ve may find trade looking up.  Of course ithas been said the great thing has been, the publication of theCotton Report that came to hand last Priday.  Mr.Clynes wascourteous enough to present it to the trade himself, and he made a most admirable speech which we have had printed andare having circulated with the report to everyone in the trade.Of couroe, his audience was a limited one, but a very re-presentative one, and he got a ver^ good and friendly&apos; receptionfrom it.  In regard to the criticism ol the report, and I am not go;j.ng to take up your time with it, the facts, he said,were well drawn, short, and it practically contains no new ideas,nothing that we have not been talking of in the trade for thelast two years, but it has two very distinct advantages:  oneadvantage is that it permits the trade to ^o forward if it can.Luring the past year every time anything has been brought up on any progress attempted to be made we have always been met with the remark that we must wait until the Cotton Report came out.  Now it is out and out of the way.  Another point is that many of the very excellent suggestions which it contains come
with the force of coming from outsiders from the trade;   coming from men who have nothing whatever to do with the trade  andprobably know very little about the trade, I think that  is avery great advantage to those of us who are working on thequestion.   The report at the present time has gone round to every member of the trade;  every section will meet and  will discuss it, and. then the probabilities are that within areasonable time we shall have some joint meetings to discuss it from the point of view of the whole trade together, and  I amhopeful that something may come of it.   Of course, the  whole situation is very difficult, and it is very touchy work  todeal with the various interests in the trade, but I am hopeful that that will have an effect, and v/e shall be able to cometo some arrangement, which will make the regaining of some ofthe trade which has been lost more possible than it is underthe oresent conditions.                              HOSIERY.     MR. WALKER:  Mr. Chairman, trade continues generally in adepressed condition, although there has been a  slight improve-ment in the last month or so.   The last reports show it is stillin a depressed condition, but if anything it is slightly betterthan the last two months.   At the same time business Isdifficult to obtain and small in quantity, and the feeling inregard to the continued and increasing importations of foreignhosiery is becoming more intense in the home trade.In regard to the spring goods, owing to the warmer weather trade has been better, and then they say that in common with other trades the home trade industry is feeling the general depressionwhich is being experienced at the present time.    I would liketo make a comment or two about the importation of foreign goods.The importations have been greatly increased in cottonstockings and fancy goods.   That is possibly due to the shortageof money generally throughout the country, but in the artificial silk goods the figures are remarkable.    For the five month sending May, 1928, the importation of artificial silk hose was215,000 dozen;  for the same period in 1930 that has increasedto 707,000, an increase of 2i times as much in the two years;and a big increase like that is bound to have a very serious effect upon that employment, and that I think is accentuated,because during the same period the importation for real  silkhose has steadily gone down.   I think these big figures are dueto what I might call the rather clever evasion of the silkduties   not altogether, but they have found a means of gettingover it to a certain extent.   The goods coming from Germany andother countries have come in the rough, not in the finished hose;many of them come in in the rough and they are being sent toBritish firms to be dyed and made up,&quot;and in a very great number,of cases they are sold as British goods.    I am hoping that thenew Merchandise Marks Order which comes into force on August 1stwill have a very beneficial effect in checking that,  but it ispretty obvious there is something abnormal to account for thatincrease of 2-g- times in two years.     MR. H.W. LEE:  I hope you will not try to stop me from making any stockings, because they are  practically all made inManchester.   We shall still have to use Manchester for cotton,and I do not think Lancashire will be any worse off.
     MR. HAMILTON:  You will not &quot;be worse- off than inJTottinghamwhich has been compelled to he content.     CHAIRMAN:  I think Mr. Walker and Mr.  Lee had better arguethis question out between themselves.     MR. H.W. LEE:  I should like to ask Mr.  Walker if the rateof duty is different on the unfinished than on the finishedarticle.     MR. WALKER:  No, I think it is more a question---     MR. H.W. LEE:  You suggested an evasion of duty.     MR. WALKER:  Well, no, evasion is the wrong word.    Theyare certainly within the law;  it is a means not exactly ofevading it   misrepresentation, if you like to call it.     MR. H.W. LEE:  I do not see how it is  evading in any waythe silk duties;  it is merely evading the  British market.     MR. WALKER:  Yes, that is perhaps the  better way of putting it.                         IRON &amp; STEEL.     1 R. WALMSLEY:  Mr. Chairman, I have handed in a statement,and I just want to mention one or two points&apos; covered by that statement.   In order to show the world wide extent of thedepression in the iron and steel industry I have given a table*showing the steel production of the six most important steelproducing countries in the world comparing Kay, 1929, with May,1950.   The total for those six countries was 8,881,000 tonslast year, and 7,050,000 tons this year, which is a decrease of21 per cent.   Of the individual countries the United Statesshows a decline of 24 per cent., Germany 27 per cent., and theUnited Kingdom 18 per cent., France in fact showing a slight increase.   In Great Britain the depression has becomeaccentuated and now we have 134 furnaces in blast giving areduction of seven, which is less than at any time since 1928.The actual production figures for June are not yet available,but it is estimated there will be a considerable decrease iniron and steel.   The question of prices, was very carefully considered by the steel makers in June, and in view of therestriction of demand all over the world it was felt that no reduction of price would be likely to stimulate orders,  andconsequently no change of any importance has been made in thiscountry.   On the Continent, however, prices have fallenconsiderably, and that, of course, is affecting us here wherethe importation of steel remains on the same high level and  also.,in the export markets.   Further the  reduced rate for steelon the Continent has aggravated our trouble in regard toimported pig iron.   Continental pig iron is being used for steel here as well as Indian.   As one of the gentlemen dealingwith the Indian market said the Indian makers have lost theirJapanese market for the time being and were suffering from suchloss.   On the north-east coast particularly things are goingfrom bad to worse, and I am afraid additional furnaces will  beput out of action.   It is true there have been one or twoorders placed for ships, but the orders cominc through certainlydo not replace those lost and our orders booked are going downvery rapidly.   I think the position is very similar inScotland and others districts, and there is reallyno silver lining,  at the present time.                    * See Appendix p.26.
                             BUILDING.     MR. BARRON:  In regard to building,  I  am afraid I have tocontinue the tale of depression.    Building is very  depressed and practically only public buildings such as banks,  insuranceoffices and entertainment houses  are being  proceeded with.   Ifit was not for these three items, the building trade would be ina worse position, but the banks and insurance companies are putting up some very fine premises for which we are  very  gratefulindeed.   Houses, as you know, are still  scant.    In regard to building I should say at the moment the cost of building  is aboutas low as it is likely to be;  production per unit,  as we are toldby employers, is higher than it has ever  been, and therefore inspite of the depressed uonjition  of the industry generally,I think that any industrial concern wnich requires building inthe near future ought to set about it now rather than wait untilthe boom comes again and prices go up.    There is a  necessity formany buildings in connection with the changing over  of localauthorities, school committees and so on, but these  authoritiesare keen on exercising economy and holding  over any  plans.  Inregard to people saying there is  no foreign competition in building,there is one particular section where there is very  excessivecompetition from, the United States of America.    In the  UnitedStates of America there has been  a large  trade done  in importeddoors, and owing to the depression here and in other countries there is excessive competition between those exporting companies.They have fallen out amongst themselves in  regard to price fixing,and they are placing doors on the market  at 7s. ;  good qualityordinary four panelled doors round about  7s.  to 9s., and  it isimpossible for the home manufacturer to compete because of the verynatural advantages that those mills have.   Their mills are placedin the lumber district, and arising out of  the freightage conditionsin the shipping world it is cheaper to bring manufactured doorsthan to bring to this country the equivalent timber  which wouldmake those doors, and therefore we have found that while  we haveneither the builders nor other parties opposed to the coming in ofthis joinery we have found that local authorities especially have got into the habit of not even giving the home manufacturers a chance to compete.   In many of the specifications of housingschemes there is a special foreign door quoted which the  builderhas to take and in some cases very large  builders will have totake foreign doors while their plant is lying idle,,  which seemsrather unfortunate.   It cannot be said it  is because of  low wages, because in the country of  origin of  most of those  doorsthe wages are at least three times as high  as they are in thiscountry.SHIPBUILDING.     In regard to  shipbuilding we have had  a report whichis not quite so depressing as usual.   The only point which wasspoken about was the tonnage laid up.   First of  all I should saythat we are holding our own not only in construction in thiscountry, but in regard to the proportion  cf  the world&apos;s tonnage.In regard to laid up tonnage, I have often locked at those vessels and some of you will agree with me that  some cf them should belaid up for ever.   So many of them have  been so  long on the seasthat it is impossible to employ them as an economical proposition,and if the British shipowners desire to keep their share of the
world&apos;s trade they will require  to  replace them to compete with some of the fleets which have  been &quot;building recently.   Alarge portion of the laid up.tonnage  in my opinion is tonnagethat cannot be employed profitably, except at  some special  job,and it is hoped that the shipowners will  do  something from  that point 01 view.COAL.     MR.  MrfCHELL:   There is no improvement  in  the Scottishcoal trade.    There have been further reductions  in prices andthere has been much idle time at the collieries,  the  quantitiesshipped being considerably less than those for  thecorresponding period last year.    The outputs for June are fully 50,000 tons per week less than in May  and about 150,000less than in January and February.    The  numbers  of men employed are 2,000 to 3,000 less in June  than in  May  and fully5,000 less than in January and February,IRON AND ST3EL.     As regards the iron and steel trade there is very littledoing in pig iron.   The price  .of Scottish pig iron for steelworks purposes is non-competitive.   Notices have been given that certain blast furnaces at Glengarnock will cease operationsnext week, and it is expected that other furnaces will be blownout.   The pig iron output in May was about 5,000 tons more thanin May, 1929, but is now reduced.    Large quantities of Indianpig iron are being delivered and Continental basic pig iron isbeing offered and some has been sold at the lowest prices sincethe war.   The metal scrap position is still very easy andthere is a greater supply than is required.    There was a largeimport in May, S;173 tons having been imported.   The totalimports for the country in May was 14,702 tons as compared  with about 14,000 tons exported.   There are apparently oldcontracts running as Germany is importing from the south coast and at the same time sending into Scotland.    The steel tradeis, if anything, worse than it was a month age and there is muchshort time at the works.   An amalgamation arrangement is reportedbetween David Colville and Sons and James Dunlop and Company andnotice of termination of engagements has been given to the  men employed in James Dunlop and Company&apos;s Calderbank Steel Company.There is no improvement in the prospects of shipbuilding and atleast one yard has nothing on the stocks.   The tube trade  isdull;  there is no improvement in the trade to Australia, andthis continues to be a pretty idle time for many companies.The textile works are not working well;  some companies are working short time and some are closed.GM1RAL TRADE.     The report from Liverpool about  the  coal    trade  is  that  gascoke is beginning to move.    Four cargoes of about 2,000 tonseach have been arranged in July fer Scandinavia.   In regard tocotton there is a remark to the effect  that  last  month  haswitnessed the failure of the attempts of  the various governments to sustain prices, for the American Farm.  Relief Board could  not prevent the collapse of the July position in New  York.Alexandria also witnessed a debacle in  the Egyptian  cottonmarket and a crisis in the Bombay market,  where the  effort to fix
minimum prices after the decline was unsuccessful.    Inthe meat trade very unsatisfactory conditions have  prevailed.As regards ship repairing the conditions are slack  and thereports show a further slight falling off in the month of June,As regards oilseeds, linseed is steady and cotton seed slow.Petroleum deliveries were fairly heavy at the beginning of themonth and were active on a large scale.   There were liberalsupplies of green fruit available and prices firm.    As regardsdried fruits, sales were moderately good.   As regards thegeneral exports from the Port of Liverpool during the month ofJune no improvement is to be reported.   Taken as a whole itis not considered that the coming month will show any improvement over the last.   In fact it is considered that theexport trade will show a decrease.    In the chemical tradelocal conditions are steadily deteriorating.    Rationalisationappears to be responsible for the removal of a considerableamount of heavy chemical business from this district.Unemployment is steadily on the increase.   The retail tradeis badly affected by the continued and increasing number ofunemployed.MARINE ENGINEERING.     MR. RICHMOND;  The chief feature in June in Scotland hasbeen the number of launches.   The output of Scottish yardsfor the month was 26 vessels, which is the largest sif any month this year.   The total tonnage was 92,700 tons gross,but almost half of this is represented by the C.P.R. rSmpressof Britain!    The reflection of this output will be seen inthe early completion of the corresponding engine contracts andthe necessity for replacing these.   The new Cunarder andthe two P. &amp; O vessels recently placed have certainly improvedthe outlook, and the prospects on the Clyde for the latter-portion of the year are not so discouraging as at one timeappeared likely.   On the north-east coast the first six months have been fairly satisfactory as regards output.   Sir ErnestGlover has mentioned that two large whaling tankers were orderedon the north-east coast, but generally the demand for tanker tonnage is slack and the prospects for the coming winter arerather unpromising.   There are, however, still enquiries inthe market which may materialise later.   Repair and overhaulwork has been fairly brisk.   There is nothing fresh to reportin the way of contracts from the Mersey or Belfast, but inaddition to the naval work which they have secured, it isrumoured that Messrs. Vickers of Barrow are likely to be successful in obtaining the order for the Union Steam ShipCompany of New Zealand&apos;s new vessel.   The naval programme towhich I referred last month has now been announced, and will beof considerable assistance to the&apos; industry.   It contemplatesan expenditure cf nine million pounds over three years, butas it is understood the orders will not be placed till early next year it does not come into our purview to-day.   In regardto general engineering, I can only hope that the shipownerswill take the advice Mr. Barron tendered them and start toreplace their obsolete tonnage as soon as possible.     CHAIRMAN:  I think that matter is being very fullyexamined just now.   I do not know what will be the outcome ofit.                            -18-
PISTxilBuTING TRADES.     SIR WOODMAN BUBBXDGE:   The report of the RetailDistributors1 Stores for June i-p not very satisfactory,in spits of the fact that this year Whltsun comes in that mesnfth,against May of last year.  The report shows a depression oftrade all through the West End stores.  There is onesatisfaction,  however, which la that the Women*s WearDepartment shows less decrease than the other sectiorja.  Theworet departments are the furniture and hardware sections, gieall report a general decrease.  A slight improvement is  shownIn the trading of the suburban stores.  The north as a wholeshows that trade la better there than In the south, as manyof the stores show a slight increase, but one has to remember that they showed a bigger decrease in trade than the southlast year.  The furniture and hardware sections also show adecrease In trade.  The stores in the Bouth have had very similar experience to other parts of the country, most ofthe departments showing a deorease, although the hardwaresection reveals a better increase than the others.  Generallyspeaking, the Btore trade is not satisfactory, and also  the sales which started in the latter part of June and also  in thefirst week of July have not shown any Inoreases, and we do not anticipate that the returns for July will show any Improvement.OO-OPERATIVE TRADE IN SCOTLAND.     MR. OAIRNS:  In the provision trade a feature of themonth has been the continuance of the trend tovaras the pre-war level of wholesale prices for the principal articles.Stimulated by the facilities for marketing afforded by the milk pool, the production of milk continues to be large in comparison with former seasons, with the result that aconsiderable proportion of the yield is being turned intocheese.  During June, which Is the peak month for the flow of milk, the make of cheese in Scotland was reported to be40,000 owt. weekly.  Top qualities of Cheddar and Dunlop oanbe purchased at the farm or oreamery at the average price of66s. and 60s. respectively per owt.., prices which are similar-to those for the corresponding period of 1912.  Canadianoheeses of June make are quoted at 13a. less than last year&apos;sprice.  Following the downward owursw of wheat and flour theprioe of bread has been reduced in Edinburghoo 8d, for the4 lb. loaf, though if the formula used before the War by the master Bakers&apos; Association for fixing the price of bread inrelation to that of flour was used npw the price would be 7d.It is claimed that the increase which has taken place since in bakers * wages and &apos; overhead charges necessitates a largermargin between the prioe of flour ami that of bread.  At ourflour mills where about 1,800 tons of flour are produoedweekly the glut of offals has become serious, ^,s not even theexceedingly low prioes at whioh they are offered for saleIs sufficient to get them away for consumption.  The market for oats remains without any qvotable change since last month.The finest quality of Scotch oats are being delivered at the mill for 18s. 9d. to 19s, 6d, per quarter of 336 lbs.  Theoffals from oatmeal are almost unsaleable owing to laok of demand.  The effect produoed on the lentil market by the
1 KiX t/trouble in India has disappear^ and the  supply oflentils from the nsw crops is steadily maintained.During the last fortnight prices have fallen 2s. to  Ss,  perowt. at whieh thoy ar* &quot;below the 1914 quotations.  Theunusually hot and dry woather whioh has been prevailing  in denmark and Holland has lessoned the supply of milk  andconsequently the production of butter. This led to  higher prices which have advanced 15s, par owt.  in three weeks,though the prioe this week as somparod with that f$r thecorresponding period of last year is 10s. lower,  Irishbutter is coming forward in small quantities. In the early part of the season especially Irish butter is always subjectte the disadvantage that Danish having been in supply all theyear round is in possession of the market with the consumersused to it, and as a consequence a relatively lower  price hasto fee accepted for Irish to get it introduced.  Irish will never command an equal hold         ish butter in this countryuntil the supply is kept up summer and winter.  Throughoutthe season 1929-1^30 our preserve factories had an experienceof quiet trade.  The quietness was eai3 to be due to thefact that last year an abundance of cheap fruit combined with a moderate prioe for sugar caused a big increase in thequantity of jams and jellies made domestically.  This yearstrawberries have been much oheaper than last and with Bugaralso cheaper it may be expeoted that the home made articlewill compete still more with the factory made.  However,makers seem to be taking up the challenge more  than they didlast year and already new strawberry jam of the finest qualityis on sale everywhere at a considerable reduction on lastseason&apos;s price.  For 1929 our  sales of house coal were 410,712tons, and the average prioe was 20s. 5d.  at the pit.  Duringthe first three months of this year the average prioe was20s. 5d. at the pit.  For the month of April the average pricefell to 20s., for May to 19s., and for June to  18s.  Thereforefor June the average price at  the pit was 2s. 5d. under theaverage prioe for the whole of 1929.00-OPERATIVE TRADE.     Mit. VARLEY:   In previous months I have told you that ourBales (Oo-Operative Wholesale, Ltd.) in money values, hadkept either at an inorease or at uniform figures with a yearago, but this month I have got a different tale to tell owingto the incidence of the movable feast of Whitsuntide.  So faras the Horth, Lancashire and Yorkshire, is concerned, ourmoney sales are down considerably, so far as the London districtis concerned they are practically no different.  To show thedifference, in Manchester our sales are down  478,000, but inLondon they ar* down only  1,263, which shows that the movablefeast of Whitsuntide affects UB more in the North than itdoes in the South.  So far as the retail prices are concerned,they are down with the wholesale prices.  For instance onthe year butter is down in the wholesale prioe 19.81 percent, and in the retail 21,74, and bacon is down 12 per cent.wholesale, but only 5.56 per cent retail; on the other handcheese ie down 14,5 per cent, wholesale ana 27.78 per centretailj they vary somewhat.  So far as butter Is concerned theprioe is increasing, but still Is round about 30s, Od. lower than a year ago.  Good supplies are ooming from Ireland, thequality is excellent and values round about the same figuresaB the Colonial.  Cheese is having to compete very stronglywith the New Zealand and the Oanadian, and perhapB the Umpire
1 r. 9JL O h)Marketing Board oan help the British cheese-maker,  as  well  asthe Canadian and the New Zealand cheese-maker;  thoy leave uson this Bide severely alone and advertise the New Zealandproduoto to their benefit.  As far as sugar is  concerned itis about the same price, and dried fruit has a  steady  market,but each department is filled with new crops from Australia.Evaporated fruits have been selling fairly well, but thedemand is dull and below the normal for the time of the year.As far as Canned Goods are concerned the reports from the siberian fishery so far are poor, from the Canadian, moderate^and from Alaska only fair.  The opening prioes  for the  seasonfor any packs have not yet been named.  Canned  Meats are lowerand not in any great demand.  As far as uanned  Fruits  areconcerned, they are expeoted to be considerable, T&amp;ut packerswill not paok too great a quantity as last year&apos;a*pack has  notbeen marketed at a remunerative figure,  Singapore Pineapplesare dearer owing - It is said - to short supply of fruit, butwe think It is in consequence of the failures through sellingprices being below oost.  So far as Meats are concerned, thetrade for all classes has been very disappointing, because ofthe values being far in advance of the actual realised prices.This unsatisfactory state is likely to last for the next fewweeks, especially for beef, whereas with the warmer weatherlamb is likely to be in better demand.  In regard to SoftFruits, the Hampshire Strawberry crop has been disposed of;  theGambridge crop is now coming on and meeting vith a very activedemand.  The Wheat market is down 3s. Od. to 5s. Od. per quarter on the month, the main causes being that exporting countries now realise that  there is a considerable surplus ofwheat on the market.  Oaiada i&amp; much disappointed at the low prices now prevailing, and  the holding policy is provingunprofitable for the time being.  No help seems to be forth^coming from Government sources, but the Banks have not shownserious anxiety with regard to their securities in the wheatstocks,  in the United States the Farm Board have lost enormoussums of money In the price  obtained, Itut they are stilladvising farmers not to sell their wheat, although the price is still falling and the new crop is coming in.  It will lieremarkable if in 1930 It should prove that the United StatesGovernment have to admit that in spite of their universalresources the law of supply and demand has beaten them.  Inliussia there is a prospect  of very large quantities of wheatcoming forward, of which I  cannot speak for the moment.  InAustralia they are still increasing their acreage, but theycomplain about the price.   India is *ffering vrfteat daily and taking little notioe of the efforts of Canada and Australia  tolift prices.  The Argentine is not such aJfe important factor  as most of the last crop has been disposed of, the growing crop  isreported to be too rank, and frost is hoped for to check thegrowth of the present crop  owing to the abnormally fine winter.The law of supply  and demand seems to fce of paramountinfluence, and the oarry over from previous crops is occupying the space which should be available for the storage of newcrops.     In regard to offals, we have the same difficulty hereon this side as Mr. CairnB  has mentioned on the Scotoh; theyare below pre-war prices, yet they are difficult to sell.Farmers are now getting offals at very low prices and theanimal population should increase.  With the present lowprioes an effort should be made to Inorease the production ofbaoon in our own oountry, instead of having to import so much from Denmark and other places,  I think things  are generallygood, that is so far as our export department isconcerned.  I mentioned two months ago that we had an order-SI-
11) ti for cloth from Russia and from our mills  at Leeds  and Bradford we have delivered  2,221 worth of woollen cloth, which as you krx-w is a fairly good yardage.  Our  savings  in our Savings Department are still Increasing,  and  o\en though there is had trade  generally, especially  in Lancashire and Yorkshire,  where  our Societies are strongest, yet  our assets in the way of liquid assets in savings and  so  on in  the Bank, have  increased during the year  at the rate of about one million pounds per  month.      CHAIRMAN:   I suppose  you have no information  as  to the extent of the wheat crop of Canada this year?      MR.  VARLEY:  Not yet, Sir.      SIR HUGO HIRST:   One  is  informed Russia  expects  a full crop this year.   Yon said  you expect  to get a lot  of  wheat from Russia.   I  suppose you have definite  information on that?      MR.  VARLEY:  Yes,  that is eo far as our  information at the  moment  goes  that is quite correct,  but it is mentioned  in my notes  that it  is  very secret.      CHAIRMAN:  The  report is  that they are developing very rapidly by  the use  of  tractors,  an enormous number of tractors being sold  to them  by  Fords I  understand,  and they are developing  their  mechanical operations, so it is quite possible there might be a  surplus of wheat for export.      MR.  VARLEY:  We are sending  them machinery and materials of different  kinds.  I have only mentioned cloths, because they  are  our  own  production; we have  sent  them  26,000 ofmetals during the month,                             WOOL.      ALDERMAN TITTERING TON:   In regard  to  the wool-textile industry, the dispute  position has  been largely cleared up,not  satisfactorily and not mutually.  A number of  employers In the Huddersfield fine cloth district have settled  on areduction of  7.25 per  cent.,  and  some of the power loom over-lookers have  also made separate  settlements with their employers on what is known as  the  5,8 basis.  The majorityof the power  loom overlookers,  however, are still  in  disputeafter the expiration of thirteen weeks from the commencementof the dispute.   Most of the  7.25  per cent, agreements (ascompared with the 9,249 per cent,  reduction In the iviacmilianReport) have been made for a  period of  six months, when itis possible that  the wages  issue may be again reopened.     The  oombers have quickly  caught up with the demandfor tops, and the shortage  aaused  by  the Dispute has been removed.  The tendency at  the moment in all seoti*ns  of theindustry  is for more short  time to be worked.  Worstedspinners have been fairly  well  employed recently both inFrance and Germany, but in England  there is much idle orpartially employed machinery.   Possibly some business hasbeen  lost to  the Continent  owing to the dispute.  Even onthe Continent, however, business is now slaoker, due  to the reaction  in prices, which have come down to very near the                               -22-
 lowest  point reached  towards the end of March.  A  quiet period  seems to be ahead, but it seems to be generally agreed that wool  values have been to some extent stabilised.  There will be ups and downs of course, but no further major decline is expected.  There are surplus stocks of wool in  Australia, New Zealand and in England, but they are not alarming, and on the  other hand on  the Continent and in the United state stocks  are rather light.     Tariff questions have been to the forefront late3.y*  A ballot  taken by the Bradford Chamber of commerce showed a large majority in favour of Safeguarding.  The Australian Government has made yet another Increase in the duties on wool-textiles, and the new rates will probably limit our exports to 1quality&apos; goods.  The exchange for the  time being adds a  further obstacle to Bradford exporters.  The new United  States Tariff has also eome into effect; but the ratee were already so high that the proportionate  inorease is small in comparison with the Australian increase.     The final results of the Census of Production for the Textile Industries have been issued, and they throw some light on the safeguarding question,  A table is given in the report  showing the proportion of British and imported fabrioe retained in the home market.  In 1924 the proportion of imported goods was about 10 per cent., compared with 15 per cent, in 1912.  Sinoe 1924 the percentage has Increased, but it is doubtful whether it has got back to the pre-war figure. This seems to show that the main factor in the wool-textile Industry is a general decline in turnover, both at home and abroad.  The foreigner appears to have no greater  hold on the home market than he had before the war.     It seems unfortunate that we had to wait until 1929 for the final Census figures relating to 1924.  I  understand that some  of the delay is due to delay in returns  from firms engaged in the industry, but I have no doubt the Department oould have issued the results more quickly,  if it  had had a larger  staff at its disposal.  Economy in administration is not an unmixed blessing.     The Dyeing and Finishing sections, ootton, woollen and worsted, are undergoing severe reorganisation, involving the closing of plants, dismissals of employees,  and modification of existing piece-work schemes.  The merchanting section in the Bradford area are now posting notices for wageB reductions on the lines of the macmillan Report.  The outcome of which Is in doubt for the moment.                          EMPLOYMENT.     MR. HILTON:  There was a further increase in unemploymentas we all know, during June.  The total number of persons on the Registers of Employment Exchanges Increased by120,000 from 1,770,000 at 26th JBay, and rose to the figure which is in the newspapers this morning of 1,390,000 on the registers at the 30th June.  The increase for the month is divided between the wholly unemployed and persons temporarily stopped.  The numbers wholly unemployed increased by 5,300and the increase due to persons temporarily stopped is119,000, while those persons normally in casual employment
decreased by 3,600.  Divided between men, women and children,the increase during the month was 96,GjO for men; 27,000 forwomen, while the number of juveniles unemployed decreased by 3,000.     Considering all divisions in London and South WesternDivisions, and taking those two together, there were slightfluctuations during the month, and in the South-EasternDivision there was a steady fall in the numbers unemployed.  Bythe end of the month of June there nad been a net decreaseof about 11,000 in the number unemployed in these threeSouthern Divisions.  In Wales the figures declined during thefirst three weeks of the month but increased, in the last week.At the end of the month the numbers unemployed were about,000 lower than on 26th i-iay.  In the other four divisionsthere were increases  the heaviest increase being in the worthEastern Division where the numbers went up by about 57,000.In the North Western Division there was a further net increaseof 35; 000.     The Increased unemployment during the month is againmainly due to the coal mining and cotton textile industries,but it will be a few days yet before we have the  detailed analysis which appears in the Labour Gazette.     The total number of insured persons in employment,according to our estimates*  at 23rd June was about 4,200 lessthan at 26th May, and about 570,000   less than a year ago.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.     SIR RALPH WEDGWOOD:  The Railway Receipts for the period ending the 28th June are now on a comparable footing with those for a similar period last year, having the same holiday seasonin both, and one can make a continuous comparison of thegeneral position.  The position shows a decrease in all themain items of receipts, I mean all the four main classes,Passengers, Merchandise, Heavy Goods, Coal and Coke, and it shows an accelerating rate of decrease.  The position taken forthe first six months of the year ending 28th June shows adecline in traffic of all kinds of 3-1 per cent; this is mostnoticeable in Coal and Coke with, a decrease of 5 per cent.,4-f per cent, in merchandise, and is least marked in the passenger traffic, the decrease being 2-t per cent., where thespecial efforts made by the railway companies to recover this traffic have had some effect.  The total decrease is 3^- percent, aver a period of six months, which Illustrates the verymuch more rapid rate of decrease which is now taking place.Taking the figures for last week in compari sen with thecorresponding week last year, they show over all a decreaseof 9 per cent, which is divided as to 12 per cent, for coal and 7 per cent, for passengers, and the rate of decrease is undoubtedly going up very much as the weeks go by.  It hasaffected coal more than any other section of the traffic, and,after coal, it Is the higher classes of merchandise which arefeeling it most, and much less the lower classes of merchandise,covering raw materials and agricultural products, hut they are all showing a decrease, and there is not one of the importantCompanies which can point to an increase during the halfyear in any of these four Divisions.  The Southern Railwayeven shows a decrease in their passenger traffic.* See appendix p,&amp;2.
     As to eraployment, the short time working in the shopsboth of the London &amp; North Eastern and the London, Midland&amp; Scottish represents about 27 per cent of the whole, andthat is equal to about hall of the shop staff being on short time.     CHAIRIVJAN;  Thank you, Gentleman, for the information andfor attending this morning.  I am sure we shall all look forward to that meeting when the tone of the Reports willmaterially change.                         NEXT MEETING.     It is proposed the next meeting of this body shouldbe held in four weeks&apos; time, that is the 6th August,and no meeting in September.  It is suggested that reports should be sent in at the beginning of September.
APPENDIX.OPAL.;      SIR WALTER  RAINE  sent  the following  report:-      Excepting for Coking Coals, there has literally been nothing doing  in the Durham Market, and a great amount of idle time  has resulted.      So far as prices  are concerned, the best qualities of Coking  Coals are from  13/3  to 13/6 per ton f.o.&quot;b. with secondary  qualities not below &apos;3.3/-.   There is a certain disposition to purchase at  present prices, as it is felt they are cheap  enough, but  as quotations have become so low, Colliery people  are inclined to hold their hand, as they consider the prices  cannot  very well get worse.     As  far as what are known as &quot;Wear Specials&quot; are concerned (these are  the best Gas Coals) the price varies from 15/- to 15/6 per ton f.o.b.   Secondary qualities of Durham Gas Coals are only 13/-  f.o.b.     The introduction by the German Government of a reduced Railway  tariff on Sxoort Coals from Silesia and from the Ruhr, is bound to have its effect on our Market, as the reduction is 5/-.per  ton from the former District,  and 2/6 per ton from the latter.   Nevertheless, it is only fair to point out that the reduction only takes place on the quantity in excess of that exported in 1928, and, of course, it is difficult to form any opinion  as  to how far any benefit will accrue, but assuming that the increased quantity carried over the Railways to the particular Ports to which the reduced rates apply, were 25%&apos; over the 1928 figure, that would mean a reduction on the total ouantity of sixpence per ton  from the Ruhr,  and l/- Per tonfrom Upper Silesia,  and of course,  if the quantity were only 12^% increased, the benefit would be correspondingly reduced.Nevertheless,  in these days of furious competition, it is just small sums  like this, namely even threepence per ton9  and sometimes even less,  that makes the difference between losingand obtaining the business in view.IRON AND STEEL.MR.

NON-FERROUS&quot; MBTALS.CAPTAIN LYTTiaLTON sent the following report :-COPFER:     Conditions continue to be dull,  with sales  and enquiries on a smaller scale.    Liverpool reports that  orders for Wireare not being placed with any freedom and,  when  Wiredrawersare in the market,  they can buy outside the Association ata concession in price.     Quiet conditions continue in this  market,  and there  is little to report.     Demand is still below normal in Birmingham;   the demandfor pipe and sheet in the building trade being disappointingfor the season.   In Lancashire, however, some big schemes formunicipal electric services are under discussion,  so thatprospects for the latter months of the year appear more promising.   The White Lead manufacturers have renewed for afurther twelve months their arrangement with Continental makers.     Ho improvement can&apos; be reported and consumers are morereluctant than ever to buy forward.    In Birmingham the  demandfor galvanising is stated to be at  about 50$ capacity.     SIR GYRIL HURCOMB sent the following statement:-     The numbers of motor vehicles (excluding motor cycles)newly registered in the month of May,  1930 and in the quarterended 31st May, 1930 were 3,496 and 6,394 respectively lessthan in the corresponding periods of 1929.

     SIR ERNEST FETTER sent the following report:-     No statistics of production, foreign trade, employment,etc., in respect of the month of June are -as yet available,  andthere is no change of any moment to report in the general position.   As indicated last month the very exceptional natureof the politico-economic conditions, in which the engineering andother principal industries at present find themselves,  postulatesthat neither an easy nor a quick way out of our difficulties  is tohe achieved.   In such a position, the movement of economicforces tends to be a matter of long-term observation rather thanone of frequent visible changes.     The past few weeks have witnessed further instances of the pursuit of &quot;rationalisation&quot; in the engineering and allied heavy industries, taking various forms of re-organization, amalgamations,working agreements, etc.   One instance, directly affectingengineering industry, is the agreement recently announced betweenMessrs.  Ruston &amp; Hornsby and Messrs. R.A. Lister &amp; Co., for the division and specialisation of manufactures.    Other cases are thereconstruction of the United Steel Companies;  the financialre-organization of the Barrow-Hematite Co;  and the absorption by messrs.  Dorman, Long &amp; Co., of the Teeside Engineering  Company.     We are at present engaged on our annual analysis andsummarization of the financial results of engineering industry,as based upon a sample return of the annual reports and balancesheets of a representative number of engineering and alliedfirms.   It is as yet too early a stage to be able to givedefinite figures;  but it is already evident from the contents of the reports which have been received in constant successionin recent weeks, that the results for the financial year 1929-30will in all probability make a poorer shewing than did  its predecessor, which was bad enough.   Even so, the reports atpresent under review do not in the majority of cases go beyond31st March, 1930, and do not reflect the worst of the depressionwhich has characterised the progress of the current year.  Itis much to be feared, therefore, that the reports and balancesheets issued next year, which will in the main survey  the wholeof 1930, cannot possibly yeild any greater measure ofsatisfaction.                            RUBBER.     SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL sent the following  report     The general report on the Rubber Industry for the monthof June is depressing as there is practically no  markedactivity in any branch of the industry with the possible exception of s ;orts goods.
     Tyres..   The demand for tyres for first equipment on cars is  reflected in the report on the Motor Car situation. Consumption is down as compared with last year.   The replacement trade is maintaining about the level of last year.    In the export market there is a slight improvement hut very keen competition and low prices.     Boots &amp; Shoes.   Usual increase in demand for Summer footwear but importations from Foreign countries at absurdly lew prices are very heavy.

LORD BRADBURY sent the following report :-     In the early part of the month short money in theLondon Market was easy and bill rates weak, out of touchas usual this year with the 5?a Bank Rates and seeming to anticipate a reduction of the Rate to 2-^%.   Towards themiddle of the month however the situation altered.    Sincethe opening of the new financial year Government borrowingsby Treasury Bill had Increased and the supply of bills was thus being brought more into line with the demand for them.Money became tighter, bill rates rose to 2i% and for thefirst time this year the wide discrepancy between theofficial and Market rates disappeared and the Bank Ratebecame for the moment effective.     This turned out to be only a temporary state of affairs.On the 19th the New York Federal Reserve Rate was reduced from 3;t- to 2^.   Market rates weakened here too inconsequence and there was again talk of an impending 2\fiBank Rate, checked this time by a sudden weakening in theFrench exchange owing to heavy drawings by the French banksupon their foreign balances and the withdrawal of gold from london for Paris as fast as it could be refined for thepurpose.
     The Bank of England found it convenient during the month to alter its arrangements in paying out gold by meeting itsnoteo, as it is entitled to do, in standard gold instead offine gold.  The Bank of France on the other hand is under a statutory obligation to receive only fine gold and the goldnovf leaving the Bank of England has therefore to, be refinedbefore it can be paid into the Bank cf France.  This causesexpense and delay with the result that the French exchangemust now sink to a lower point before it is worth while tosend gold to ?ari3.  The speed with which gold can be takenIs slowed down considerably too because the amount of thegold the refiners can deal with each day Is strictly limited.     These French withdrawals had reduced the Bank of England^sgflld holding last week to,  156,000,000 but this is still 11,000,000 more than the Bank.&apos;s gold holding at the beginningof this year and  1,500,000 more than a year ago, and no serious anxiety about the gold position is yet being felt  bythe Market.     The Hew York exchange, which was making a similar goldposition look decidedly precarious a year ago, is now muchf irvier and there is hope that the normal Autumn strain upon theexc-hange will not be so great this year owing to the lowerprioos of commodities, particularly grain and cotton, and to the probability of the New York Market taking a larger share inthe finance of international crop movements t?uan it was ableto do at the height of tho speculative boom In Wall Streetlast year.     On the ISth June the long awaited Reparation Loan wasiasued.  The London share was  12,000,000 and this was quicklyoversubscribed, although the loan has since fallen to a discounton the Stock Exchange.     Business on the Stock Exchange has been very quiet, apartfrom Bpme fairly substantial buying of gilt edged securities,emanating,it is rumoured, partly from America.RAILWAY TRAFFIC,     SIR CYRIL HURC0MB sent the following report and *statement:-     During the three weeks ended, 29th June lo30 (whioh includedWhit-Monday) the railway traffic receipts of the four amalgamatedcompanies were  1,033,003 less than in the corresponding periodof 1929.

COLONIAL TRADE.     MR. VERNON sent the following report:-     Kenya and Uganda.  The value of the export trade of kenya and Uganda during the first two months of 1930 was  1,170,201,as compared with  1,148,534 in the corresponding period in 1929.     The value of the import trade of Kenya and Uganda during january, 1930, was  788,410;  as compared with  ,354,367 in thecorresponding period in 1929.  The percentage of imports fromthe United Kingdom in this period in 1930 was 37$;  as comparedwith 33% in the corresponding period in 1929,     Tanganyika Territory,   The value of the export trade of tanganyika&quot;&quot;during the first three months of 1930 was  669,684;as compared with  806,338 in the corresponding period in 1929.     The value of the import trade of Tanganyika during the first three months of 1930 was  938,873;  as compared with  930,654 inthe corresponding period in 1929.   The percentage of importsfrom the United Kingdom during this period in 1930 was 36%;  ascompared with 35% in the corresponding period in 1929.     Northern Rhodesia.   The value of the minerals produced inNorthern Rhodesia in March, 1930, was  102,344.     Gold Coast,   The value of the Gold Coast export trade inthe first three months of 1930 was  3,742,874;  as comparedwith  5,083,188 in the corresponding period in 1929.     The value of the Gold Coast import trade in the first three months of 1930 was  2:359..491;  as compared with 2,125,566 in the corresponding period in 1929.     The percentage of imports from the United Kingdom in thisperiod  in 1930 was 51%;  as compared with 47% in 1929.     Nigeria.   The value of the Nigerian export trade in thefirst three months of 1930 was  5,074,940;  as compared with 5,391,197 in the corresponding period in 1929,     The value of the Nigerian import trade in the first threemonths  of 1930 was  3,385,046;  as compared with  3,655,258 inthe corresponding period in 1929.     Ceylxm^   The value of the export trade of  CejdLon duringthe first four months of 1930 was  9;060;.6S9;  as comparedwith  10,662,349 in the corresponding period in 1929.     The value of the import trade of Ceylon during the first four months of 1930 was  8,867,963;  as compared with  10,780,145in the  corresponding period in 1929.
     British &quot;nalaya.    The total export of rubber fromBritish Malaya&quot;in hay, 1930,  is estimated to  amount  to49,039 tons;  as compared with 43,813 tons in the previous month.     The export of tin and tin in ore from the Federated malay states during May, 1930., was  6,043 tons;   as  compared  with,407 tons in the previous month.                    SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     MR. HOSE sent the following report:-     Recently published official statistics of Argentine exporttrade for the first four months of 1930 confirm the great declinein the value of the Republic&apos;s overseas shipments of produce,  andthe contraction may indubitably he regarded as the basic reasonfor the lower exchange value of the peso, which declined at onetime during the past month to 39lo/i6d.,  the lowest pointtouched since December, 1923, although there has since been aslight recovery to 40^d.   As always, the gold position is still very strong, the ratio of the precious metal held against the currency note circulation being about 77  per cent,, but there-closing of the Conversion Office in December last for the delivery of gold against paper currency effectively checked the outward flow of gold to support exchange.   Fundamentally, theArgentine economic position remains quite sound, and it wouldbe fortunate in the circumstances if the  present pressure on theexchange - side by side with the large but temporarilysterilised gold reserve - led to a more intensive study of the vital question of reorganising the present archaic currencysystem on a more efficient and elastic basis, in accordancewith accepted modern practice, as indeed  has been advocated on more than one occasion by leading Argentine economists.     The actual figures show that the total value of merchandiseexports during January - April, 1930, was 248,422,347 pesos(gold), as compared with 369,304,449 pesos in 1929, a reductionof no less than 120,882,102 pesos.   The  decline is clearly dueto the smaller volume of shipments, which totalled 3,794,016 tons.against 6,020,447 tons last year, a decrease of 2,226,431 tons,as well as the reduced values.     Although the total figures of merchandise imports into theRepublic for the first four months of 1950 are not yet available,these may be expected to be appreciably lower than those for thecorresponding period of last year.   Indeed, the latest returns of import duties, which relate to the first quarter of 1930, showthat the yield was only 34,802,047 pesos  (gold), against38,846,249 pesos in 1929.   The corresponding figures of thetotal Customs revenue of the country, including both import and export duties, were 43,422,257 pesos (gold), and 48,462,880peso3 (gold), respectively.   At the same time, mail advicesindicate that exports continued on a lower level during May,while prices of the country&apos;s export products have not improvedto any appreciable extent.   Commercial failures are somewhatheavy and collections difficult.
     Despite the partial return of commercial confidencewhich took plaoe in Brazil following the placing of the Loan of 20,000,000 sterling to enable the new scheme for thomarketing of coffee to be inaugurated, severe difficultiescontinue to be encountered in connection with the exchange position.  For some long time past, the Government Inspectorin Brazil has exercised strict control of exchange operations of all kinds, whether for legitimate trade transactions,speculation, or otherwise.  The most recent advices received,however, indicate that, in some directions, these restrictivemeasures have been partially relaxed, and at the same timethe opinion appears to be growing in official quarters thatartificial support of exchange might be fully withdrawn.  Mean-while, the market rate for 90 days1 Bight drafts on Londonhas declined to the neighbourhood of 5%&amp;. per milreis, ascompared with the effective parity of 5.899d. established underthe present provisional Monetary Laws.     The local coffee market in Sao Paulo continues dull  intone, and shipments of the commodity during May  through the port of Santos amounted to 674,221 bags, or  some 20,000 bags lessthan the loadings in the same month of  192Q.  The decreasedreturns during April and May somewhat upset anticipations inregard to the delivery of the balance of the 1928 coffee  crop,and it is now expected that the 1029  crop will not commenceto arrive in Santos until the latter part of the current  month.The Sao Paulo Coffee Institute reduced  the figure of dailyentries into Santos during June to 21,000 bags,  the supplementaryquota of 7,000 bags of the finer grade  coffee being cancelled.This measure has been adopted in view of the fact that  thefine qualities are NO.v quoted below the official basis  and also,no doubt, in expectation  of reduced loadings.     Generally speaking,  it is clear  that some  time must  elapse before any real and permanent improvement can Toe looked for  inBrazilian commercial oonditions, a change which, indeed,  mustbe dependent upon the passing of the  present world economicdepression and, more particularly, the  falling  tendency inprices of staple commodities,  it remains, however, beyonddouht  that the powerful financial  interests  through whom  therecent large coffee loan  was placed would, if necessary,  take further active steps to prevent anything in  the  nature  of amonetary debacle in the republic.     Chilean commercial conditions are  somewhat  Inactive, andthere  appears to be a slightly increased tendency for  acceptorsof bill  to request extensions of  time  for payment.  Theformation of the &quot;Cosana&quot; company, in which, no  doubt,  all thenitrate of soda producing companies in  the Aepublic will eventually be consolidated, is now practically  accomplished,the necessary Decrees having been  issued by  the  chilean government.  This scheme  will, of  course, do much  towardsplacing  the nitrate of soda industry  upon a more modernand efficient basis, whilst the construction of  new works should absorb labour and  generally constitute a  favourablefaotor in Chilean trade,  although  T-he economies  effected  may possibly tend to reduce the quantity  of imported goods  requiredin the nitrate fields.  It  is a matter  of interest to  learn that,  in Magallanes, active measures  are now being taken  to exploit  the petroleum fields whioh are  believed  to exist  inthat area.
     Peruvian conditions remain practically unaltered,  and difficulty is still being experienced in maintaining the exchangeat around the new parity of 12.163 geld soles to the    sterling,the present rate being 13,07-g-.   Some activity,  however, has beenobservable in the Lima market for raw cotton, buying having takenplace for both Liverpool and the Continent.   The condition ofthe cotton ooming forward from the new crop is reported to bepromising, whilst it is anticipated that this season the yieldwill be of better style and staple than last year.    The sugarmarket has been very quiet, although the quantity of exports ismaintained at about the same level as a year ago.   Inconnection with these conditions in the markets for Peruviansugar and cotton, it is of interest to note that the European,South Pacific and Magellan Conference advised under date 12thMay last that all shipping companies comprising the conference had agreed to lower freights on all cottcn shipped from Peruvianports to European terminal ports to  4 per ton of 1,000 kilosuntil 31st December next.   This represents a drop of  1 per ton.The minimum freight of 18s. per ton of sugar will only  remain  inforce far shipments made up to 31st August next.     A contract has been negotiated by the Peruvian Cfovernmentfor the construction of 1,000 kilometres of modern automobilehighways in the Republic.   The value of the contract is statedto be in the neighbourhood of 5,000,000 gold soles, and may beincreased eventually to 10,000,000 gold soles.    French interests are stated to be  supplying capital for the establishment of anew mining credit bank in Peru styled the Credito MineroNacional.     During recent months, the general commercial situation inMexico has been seriously affected by the decline in the market value of silver.   In some instances, mining companies  in theRepublic have been obliged to cease operations.    Congressionalelections are now in progress in Mexico, but full advices as tothe situation in this respect are not yet available.     A mere optimistic tone is prevalent in commercial  centresthroughout Colombia, largely in anticipation of an improvement- inthe general situation when the new Administration comes into office during the current month.   The official discount rate  ofthe Banco de la Republica has been lowered, and the general toneof the impart markets is somewhat  better, although no  completerevival can be expected to take place for some time.     Business conditions in Guatemala are still dull and creditis restricted.   The quantity of coffee exported, however,  ismaintained, and prospects for the new crop are satisfactory.According to mail advices, weather conditions in Venezuelacontinue favourable to the coffee crop, and it is expected thatan excellent harvest will be gathered this season,    Prices ofthe commodity are steady,   Entries of cocoa into the localmarkets continue to arrive slowly.     In regard to conditions in Salvador, it is of interest to learn that the loan service for the present year was completed by 15th May.   This was somewhat unexpected, in view of thedepression consequent upon the fall in coffee prices, and,  indeed,it was believed in some quarters that it would not be completeduntil July.   Trade remains vary quiet, and merchants report a distinct falling off in sales.
