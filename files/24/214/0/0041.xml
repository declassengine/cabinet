    [This Document is  the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                     Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1930.SECRET.   CP. 2S9 (30).                                                         ^                                  CABINET.The General Political  Situation in India,      MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF  STATE  FOR INDIA.   I circulate, for the information cf my colleagues, the Report of the Governors&apos;Conference which was  held at Simla  on the  23rd July.  It  gives a recent and authoritative  account of the Civil Disobedience Movement.  It will  be  observedthat  the  Governors of the  Central  Provinces, the  United   Provinces,  and  the punjab  ask that  an Ordinance  on the lines  of  a  Defence  of  the Realm  Actshould  be drafted ready for  use, and the Governor of Bombay would like  sucha measure imposed at once.  The other points  of interest in the Report are:     (1)  The  character  of  the powers suggested by the Governor of the Central         Provinces  in  such a measure, which  include  collective  punishment, the         deprivation of  civil rights and the forfeiture of property.    (2)  The  growing participation of local bodies, as such, in the movement and         the sympathy of  Hindu  Civil Servants.    (3)  The complaint by  the Governor of  the Punjab  that Appellate Courts are         likely to take a sympathetic view of the Civil Disobedience Movement, and         the  statement  by  the Governor of  the Central Provinces that a number         of Sessions Judges are in sympathy with  the movement.   1  circulate  this paper so  that  the Cabinet may be  informed  of  the gravecharacter of the  situation  and  the  possibility that unless   some   settlement isreached  four Provinces at  least, with a total  population  of   almost 100 millions,may be put under something  comparable to martial  law.                                                                    W. B.   9th August  1930.
SECRET.Conference  held at Viceregal  Lodge on Wednesday,  23rd July.                        PRESENT:His Excellency the Viceroy,Their Excellencies the Governors of all Provinces,The Honourable Members of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council.                I-Discussion of the Political Situation.   1. His Excellency  the Viceroy in opening the Conference invited the views of the governors on the general situation in their provinces.                                    Bengal.   2. His Excellency  the Governor of Bengal said that in his province there is  good reason to believe that  the movement is definitely on the decline.  Picketing is giving a certain amount of trouble, but  there is not much force behind it, and although thereturn of students from  their  vacations might  give an  impetus to picketing  by providing more  volunteers,  he is not greatly concerned  on this  account.  Fundsappear to be  decreasing, and there are signs  of lassitude.  The position in the  rural areas is  on  the - whole  not  unsatisfactory.  If  they are  left  alone,  dangerousdevelopments are likely to occur in some districts ; but as soon as  they are vigorouslytackled conditions  are soon restored  to normal.  They have not  sufficient police,however, to permit of vigorous action simultaneously in  all districts.  The police force has been increased  by 500 and additional police have also been posted at theexpense of the inhabitants in three  places, while proposals are under consideration for  similar  action in two  other places.   They  have borrowed from  the AssamGovernment  300 men of  the Assam Rifles.   There is  now under consideration aproposal&quot; for the addition  of  one armed battalion of police.  His District Officers aregenerally hopeful.  He himself considers that the time is now opportune for vigorouspropaganda,  and that once  the  movement begins to go it will  go quickly.   It is,however, generally recognised that the failure of the civil disobedience movement willbe followed by an increase in terrorist activities.                                    Madras.   3. His Excellency  the Governor of Madras said that in his Presidency the situation has definitely improved and  the movement is on the  decline.  Picketing is  giving acertain amount of trouble.  An increase of 500 in the police force has been sanctioned ;but the whole of these additional men are  not yet functioning.  Propaganda is beingcarried on with  good  results.   District Officers are doing valuable work in thisdh-eetion and non-officials are helping and have begun to hold meetings in oppositionto the Congress.                                    Bombay.   4. His Excellency  the Governor of Bombay  said that Sind has  so far  been verylittle affected, except  in Karachi.  The South of the  Presidency has also given verylittle trouble.  The Deccan is watching Bombay, and  the movement is getting  somehold there.  In Bombay City and in  Gujerat the  situation is very bad.  There are some indications that the movement  is diminishing a little in  Gujerat, but he ishimself inclined to think that this is  mainly due  to the monsoon.  The measures sofar taken  by his Government  have had the  effect  of  keeping  down  the level ofenthusiasm, but on the other  hand have increased the size of the movement  so far asthe number of adherents and sympathisers is concerned.  Almost the whole populationof Bombay is sympathetic, women and children included.  Counter propaganda has so far not yielded any appreciable results, except perhaps in one district  in Gujerat,where the District Officer is issuing a news  sheet.   The  conditions do  not  allowcounter meetings to be held.   The Press and Unauthorised News-sheets Ordinanceshave been valuable, largely because they increased the powers of  the executive.   Theother Ordinances have not been  of much use, probably because  they did not investthe executive with sufficient powers.
   Economic conditions have contributed largely towards the movement.  business is almost at a standstill in Bombay City.   The Stock Exchange is rarely opened ; the mill industry is in a bad way ;  some- mills have already, closed down and others arelikely to close.  There is a danger that 100,000 mill-hands will be out of employment at an early date.  Most of these are in very straitened circumstances, and the onlypalliative he could see at the  moment, if  there were a general  closure of mills, wouldbe to send as  many mill-hands as possible back to their  homes on free passes.  Atthe moment, the Congress are making vigorous efforts to  bring the  mill-hands overto their side, and their chances of success are not unfavourable.  The labourers have lost faith in their Unions and Union leaders, and mill labour generally may easily be worked up into an inflammable state.   Congress have plenty of  funds and  will beable to use them for this purpose.   He is  anxious regarding the future  attitude of the rural population.  Price ofcotton has seriously fallen,  and he is  afraid that the  cultivators will  have  greatdifficulty in selling their present crop when it matures.  To a very small  extent theycan  substitute  other crops for cotton, but this- would take time, and  in any case thesubstitution would not  be. on a large scale.  Economic conditions  in  the villages are,therefore, likely to  be very unfavourable and in consequence one has to expect greatdiscontent  and  consequent opportunities  to  Congress to create  feelings hostile toGovernment.   He is not very hopeful that the financial losses which the movement is causing, and will continue to cause, to  Bombay City will produce serious reactions-against the Congress:  Many of the industrialists and business men who are-supporting.the movement do not mind if  they are broken, provided that  Government is  brokenalso.  A certain  number of  leading industrialists would  no  doubt Tike to see, themovement come to an end, but their employees are all in it and they insist on businessbeing closed clown whenever an excuse offers.  While he thought that the occupationof the Congress, House would have some moral effect on the situation, he believed thatany number of other houses would be made available for Congress  purposes.   The police have been excellent, although occasional  mistakes have  been made.His Government have sanctioned  an increase of 2,400 men, but  the  whole  of this number have  not  yet  been recruited;   and although at first there had been  nodifficulty in obtaining  recruits, recruiting has  recently  slackened and it  has been necessary to extend the  period of temporary service to one year.   He considered  it most desirable that an Ordinance  should be prepared with as little delay as possible  on the lines of Defence  of Realm  Act.  The chief object tobe aimed at would be to give wide powers to local executive officers in those areas where an emergency existed, and, in particular, to invest  District Magistrates withthe power to  make regulations.  He would like to  have  an Ordinance of  this kindat once, but realised the difficulty of  promulgating an  Ordinance granting suchdrastic  powers  if it were required in one province only.  He, however, urged thenecessity of preparing one with as little delay as possible.                               Central Provinces.   5. His Excellency the  Governor of the Central Provinces  said  that the movement is gaining force  in his province.   It  is  sweeping up from Bombay into Berar andMahratta  country.   The popular  attitude towards it  is semi-religious,  and to aconsiderable extent ignores considerations of personal loss.   Women  and children are taking an enthusiastic part in  it, and owing to  the terror of  social boycott fewnon-official leaders have the courage to come forward on  the side of Government.  Itis spreading into the villages, and  he also is greatly^boncernecl regarding the future economic prospects.  He  thought  that November  and December  would be  criticalmonths.  Cotton would  then come  on the market and if  the growers could not sellit, there would be a great deal of rural discontent.   The police, -which had previously been a little below strength,  have been brought up  to normal; but difficulty of recruitment represents a serious  obstacle  to any considerable increase in the strength of the force.   He is strongly in favour of an Ordinance on the lines of D.O.R.A.  The Ordinanceshould  create  special  tribunals, for although our difficulties in   dealing  with themovement have so  far been greatly reduced by the refusal of accused to plead or to.file appeals, their policy might,  change, and then the attitude  of the appellate courts,especially of sessions courts, would be a serious matter.   It  may be assumed that a
number of Sessions Judges are in sympathy with. the. movement.   Other matters forwhich the Ordinauce should provide are :      (a) Collective punishment on a village that had misbehaved.     (b) Suspension of local bodies.     (c) Deprivation of civil rights, e.g.  eligibility to stand for legislative or local          bodies.     (d) Forfeiture of property in certain cases.    He attached particular importance to obtaining powers of control over local bodies.:Some of these are taking an active and very effective part  in the  movement and  thepresent legal procedure is cumbersome and protracted.  Iu the meantime much harmis being done.                                United  Provinces.    6. His Excellency the Governor of the United Provinces said that in his province,-as elsewhere, the movement is mainly urban and Hindu.  Hindus generally sympathise with it, including most Hindu Government servants.  Three Weeks ago there was alull, which he  hoped represented a  definite decline,&apos; but  since then the  situation has tended to revert  to  its  former state, and  he  could not say with certainty thatthere are  now definite indications  of a  lull in  the  situation as a whole.   There has,&apos;however,  been  no  intensification in the towns, and there are signs of weariness.In rural  areas, revenue and rents are coming in  fairly well,  having regard to the&apos;economic conditions, and  there has been nothing  serious in the way of a no-tax or no-rent campaign.   In fact, the Congress leaders have temporarily given up this idea,but they  are  holding out hopes for:-next -harvest.  . In the  western districts  of  theprovince  there  have recently  been indications that villages  are  affected&apos; to someextent,  and  small  propaganda   parties are  doing  some  harm.   District Officers,however,  are  not seriously concerned at present.   The movement has undoubtedlyexcited greater enthusiasm and  emotion than was  expected, and the organisation is good.   Some local bodies have been  troublesome,  and a  few of them, containing amajority  of Swarajist members, use the staff, especially educational, for Congresspurposes.  Students  and  schoolboys are willing recruits.  Picketing has been bad ina few towns.  The attitude of District Officers towards picketing and the use of thePicketing Ordinance  varies considerably.   The  general  policy, has  been to  giveprotection to  those who want it and, iu particular, Muhammadans have been givenprotection.  Boycott  of officials has been negligible  and the police  have been very good.                                                             -    Counter propaganda  is being vigorously  carried  on in various  ways, e.g. articles in  newspapers, itinerant preachers  and  loyalist associations.   In some districts-anti-Congress  meetings  are successfully  held and in the Agra  district Congressparties are now unable  to go into the villages.   He attached great importance to taking  up  at  once the  question  of  local bodies  and to  providing by Ordinanceadequate  powers of suspension.   In  his  province  the harm done  by Municipalities-and District Boards is serious, especially in outlying districts where counter influencesare not effective.  Two District Boards, for instance, are using educational institutionsfor  Congress  propaganda and are trying to  enforce  the wearing of Miaddar by the-staff and  pupils.    He considered that Defence of Realm Act should be drafted  and  kept in readiness,but that it is not required at the moment.    On the whole he thought that if the Muhammadans keep  on  the right side, and we continue  steady pressure, the feeling of lassitude among the  public will increase, thatdiscontent among  parents will develop, and that after  two  or  three  months  themovement will definitely be beaten.                                     Punjab.    7. His Excellency the Governor of the Punjab said that with the exception ofAmritsar  City the situation has generally improved  in his province.  At one time theCongress had  been active in all districts, but steady and  continuous pressure hadcompletely  worn down  the  movement  in  some  places.   In  some  of  the  smallerdistricts  it is  at a standstill.  The  supply of volunteers is drying  up.   No-taxcampaigns were tried in one town and in one rural district, but failed.  Similarly,efforts have been made to boycott schools, but this also has failed.   At the same time there is a good deal of economic unrest due to low prices of  agricultural produce, andthis is being exploited by the Congress.   It might be necessary for his  Government
seriously  to consider whether  an all-round reduction  in land revenue should bemade.   He believed that if this were done, the rural population would recognise that.Government had  played  its part and the  economic stress  would  not  then createfeelings hostile to  Government.  The Sikh  position is unstable and is a potential danger.  It might spread and  become  a  source of  supply of volunteers to  theCongress.   This at present is the most anxious feature&quot;of  the situation.   Apart fromthat, the movement is very definitely declining and the situation is much better thana month ago.    In Amritsar City the position is unsatisfactory.  Intense picketing of  cloth  shops-is going on and six crores  of goods are locked up.  In  June the sales of piece goodsdropped from an average of 2b lakhs during the past two years to two lakhs only.Trade  is  practically  at  a standstill.  Leading merchants  are subscribing to  the-Congress funds and paying the picketers who picket their shops. - The sale of Indian-made goods is restricted,  because merchants cannot get them on  credit and their capital  is locked up.   There are signs that traders are getting tired of  this  state ofaffairs,  and they may perhaps approach Government for assistance.    He considered that D.O.R.A. should be drafted and held in reserve.  He attachedspecial  importance  to tribunals,  since some of the Appellate Courts are likely to takea view very sympathetic to the civil disobedience movement and to  reduce sentences,.if appeals are filed  before them.   Generally he does not think that we can count onan early cessation of the movement, and fears -that there  may be a recrudescence-after the Round-Table Conference.                                 Bihar and Orissa.    8. His Excellency  the Governor of Bihar and  Orissa stated that with the exception&apos;of  three districts his officers believe  that  the  corner  has  been definitely turned.people are getting  tired of picketing  and  so are.the picketers.   The boycott of  police-has now  practically  ceased,  and  in this  connection   eight  or   nine  successfulprosecutions have had an excellent effect.   At one time he was anxious about students-and schoolboys joining the  movement in large numbers,&apos; but this danger has notmaterialised largely owing to the attitude taken  by the  Provincial Congress  leaders.In Bihar  and  Orissa the semi-religious hysteria  manifest in  Bombay and the central provinces is absent, and the movement is regarded rather as a means to annoy andirritate Government.   The Legislative Council has behaved well.   By a  majority of3 to 1 it passed a demand for additional police and another for propaganda proposes..Some  of  the  leading zamindars are playing  up,  and  propaganda is  proceeding satisfactorily.   The campaign  against the  Chowkidari Tax  has achieved very littlesuccess and  is not  now  being seriously  prosecuted.    Several Municipalities and district Boards passed  resolutions  in favour of  hoisting  the national  flag.    Theresolutions were cancelled  and the flags pulled down . by  executive action.  Three-districts  are  still  the source  of some  anxiety,  namely, Balasore, Bhagalpur andManbhum.   In these, volunteers are doing propaganda in  some villages, and thegeneral situation is affected by conditions in adjacent Bengal districts.                                      Assam.    9. His Excellency the Governor of Assam  explained that the  conditions  in his.province were exceptional.  The  province is almost entirely agricultural, and there are very few towns.   Some parts of the province have been  infected  from Bengal. During the non-co-operation movement the chief source of trouble was  agitation in the tea gardens, but these so far have given little trouble, although the  price  of tea has fallen.   They tackled the problem of students, and schoolboys  by the  issue of a. circular, which requires an undertaking by  parents that their sons will not participate in^ any political movement.   This  created  loud protests,  but  in  spite  of these undertakings have been given  in regard  to 75 per cent, of  the pupils.   The reply to this action by Government has been incendiarism, and three important schools have been burnt down.   In regard to one of these institutions, an indignation meeting of parents was  held, but was broken up  by  schoolboys.   A  fall in  the  price  of jute might  oause;economic difficulties and aggravate the situation, but  otherwise he feels fairly happy regarding the future.     10. His Excellency the  Viceroy,  in  summing up  the  discussion, explained the attitude of Government towards the efforts of Sir Tej Bahadur Sapiu and Mr. Jayakar to obtain a solution.  His  Excellency explained that  the initiative had  come entirely
from them and that he had refused to give any assurance beyond what he had statedin his address to the  Legislature on the  9th  July.  The Government of India-had given facilities for interviews  with  Gandhi, ore. because they felt, firstly, that  theywould not have been justified in interposing  obstacles, and secondly, that if Gandhi,&amp;c, were unreasonable, this would perhaps  help  the  moderates in their decision to-go to the llonnd-Table Conference.   His Excellency observed that if the civil disobedience  movement were not calledoff, the conclusions  resulting from  the  discussion appeared to be that Governmentshould continue steady pressure on existing lines, take up at once the question ofpromulgating at an early date an Ordinance  to  deal effectively with local bodies andalso prepare for use, if required, an Ordinance on the lines of D.O.R.A.                          II. Question of Amnesty.   1. His Excellency the Viceroy then invited the views of the  Governors regardingthe question of an amnesty.  He explained that in reply to the personal and private letter he had  addressed  to them,  the  Governors of Madras and Punjab had raisedcertain objections of principle,  while the other Governors had on the whole agreed tothe necessity at some time or another of release of prisoners, while expressing in  somecases some differences  of opinion regarding details.  His Excellency made no mention of the matter in his address to the Central Legislature, because he felt that it would do little  good at  that  moment and might create difficulties.  It is, however, obviousthat the  question must be considered if the efforts for peace show signs of leading toany results.   2. His Excellency  the Governor  of  the  Punjab said that he feels  considerabledifficulty in finding  a  satisfactory formula.  There are associations, such as the NauJawan Bharat  Sabha  and the Kirti  Kisan, whose  attitude is definitely  anti-Gandhi,but who have none the less taken part in the civil disobedience  movement with  theresult that many of their members  are now in  prison.  A good number  of these  arerevolutionaries and Communists, and they are unlikely to  follow Gandhi if he called the movement off.  These appear to require different treatment from that given to truefollowers of Gandhi.   Again, the Provincial Legislatures have on the whole supportedGovernment, and the members deserve consideration.  So far, at any rate, as the Punjabis concerned,  a fair number of Congress leaders now in jail would, if released, stand for election  and their self-imposed martyrdom  would be au asset.  Their  candidaturewould be embarrassing to present  members who stood by Government,  and their release from jail at present would be resented. Again, the feeling of the police deservesconsideration.  The prisoners  include  many who had  openly sympathised  withrevolutionaries and had joined in meetings eulogising Bhagat Singh and Dutt.  Onthe  other hand,  there are  many prisoners, such as picketers, members  of unlawfulassemblies, persons  put on security under section 108, Criminal Procedure Code, inregard  to whom  there  would  be  no  objection  to  their early release, if the civildisobedience movement definitely ended.    3.  His Excellency the Governor  of  Madras pointed out that the  rumour  that ghandi  wo\ild shortly be let out of jail had encouraged many to court arrest in  orderto obtain cheap martyrdom.  He said that those who have  been imprisoned  havedeliberately defied  the law and  deserve  little consideration.  Their release  wouldhave a bad effect ou our friends, who would be reluctant to help us on the next occasion.    4.  His Excellency  the Governor of the United Proviuces assumed that there is noquestion of an unconditional amnesty, such as was given on the occasion  of His royal highness the Duke of  Connaught&apos;s visit to India, but that the proposal is rather thatno release of prisoners will be sanctioned until Government are satisfied that      (a)  the movement has been definitely called off, and     (6)  the&apos;persons who give assurances to this effect can and will carry  them out.    He also thought that release should be conditional  on an assurance of future good behaviour, and he instanced what was done in the Punjab in  the case of prisonersconvicted in connection with the Akali agitatioia.    5. His Excellency the Governor of Assam observed  that  the  amnesty  would presumably be accompanied by the withdrawal of exceptional measures, but in this connection he urged  that the powers  of the  Press  Ordinance should  be retained. Sir Malcolm Hailey and Sir Charles Innes pointed out  the difficulties of this.
   6. His Excellency the Governor of Bombay said that, as far as he&apos; is concerned,,the &quot;calling  off of the  movement by  Gandhi  would give  immediate  relief  to the-situation, since he believes that the vast majority of adherents of the movement inthe Bombay Presidency would follow GandhTs lead.   7. Sir Charles Innes observed that it  appeared almost essential that the calling off of the civil disobedience  movement by-Gandhi should be accompanied by some kindof concessions in  regard  to  prisoners, otherwise there would be no effective  callingoff.  It would  in practice not be possible for Government to give a blank refusal.The practical problem, therefore, was to obtain a suitable formula.   8. His Excellency the Viceroy in  summing up  the  discussion agreed  with whatSir Charles Innes had said, and observed that  if Gandhi at some time or another diddefinitely call off the movement, it would not  be possible for Government to  remainunresponsive.  He gathered that the general feeling of  the Conference was that thereshould  not be any unconditional amnesty, but  that discretion  should be left to local governments  to review  sentences  and  to  release prisoners conditionally.   while accepting this  formula  he expressed the hope that Local Governments would, whenthe time came, apply it as liberally as conditions would  permit.   9. The Governors generally agreed with the formula above stated.                                       III.   Before the Conference closed, His Excellency Sir Malcolm Hailey expressed to HisExcellency the Commander-in-Chief the great appreciation of his Government and officers for the ready and  valuable assistance given by the military authorities on alloccasions.   The other  Governors  endorsed this  appreciation.  His Excellency theCommander-in-Chief, in thanking them,  referred to the great help the civil authorities-had given in getting down troops from the hills on the occasion of Gandhi&apos;s arrest.
