THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1930.SECRET.CP. 292 (30).                                CABINET.TREATY  SETTLEMENT  WITH  IRAQ.         MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  THE COLONIES.    WITH my Memorandum of the 18th July (CP. 257 (30))  I circulated to theCabinet the text of the new Treaty with Iraq signed at Baghdad on the 30th june and the formal Notes exchanged at the time of the signature.   My colleagues willrecollect  that, in  the second Exchange  of  Notes appended to the new Treaty,provision was made for the conclusion of a separate Agreement to regulate financial questions outstanding between the two countries.    2.  Negotiations on these questions have been proceeding in London during thelast few  weeks between Sir Francis Humphrys and Nuri Pasha, the Iraq PrimeMinister.   They were brought to a successful conclusion on the  19th August, whenformal Notes were exchanged embodying the separate Agreement referred to  inthe second  Exchange of Notes appended to the Treaty.  I circulate  copies of the notes exchanged (Appendix A).  They will be published simultaneously in thiscountry and  Iraq so  soon  as Nuri Pasha has returned  to Baghdad and Arabictranslations have been made.    3.  As my colleagues will observe, the Notes deal with the financial conditions governing the relinquishment by the Royal Air Force of their  present stations  atHinaidi and Mosul, five years after the entry into force of the Treaty, and theirestablishment in new air bases in Iraq.  They also deal  with the future of the IraqRailways and the Port of Basra.  It will be observed from paragraph  1 of the Noteaddressed by Sir Francis Humph^s to Nuri  Pasha and the latter&apos;s Note in reply that the  Iraq  Government have agreed  to take over  the British aerodromes  atHinaidi and Mosul at one-third of the cost price of the permanent buildings, plant and structures thereon, certified as correct by the Air Ministry.  I should explain that the Air Ministry have already certified this price to  be  1,099,500  and this figure has been communicated to the Iraq Prime Minister.    4.  On the occasion of the exchange  of  these formal Notes,  Notes were alsoexchanged on the question  of the ability  of the Railway  Corporation, to  which itis proposed to entrust responsibility for the administration and management of theIraq railway system, to raise loan capital for the development of that system withoutthe assistance of a Government guarantee.  Copies  of these Notes will be  found  inAppendix B.  The Notes will remain unpublished.    5. On the same occasion Notes were  exchanged in regard  to the troublesomequestion of the immunity from taxation promised by His Majesty&apos;s Government  in1914 to the Shaikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait in respect of their Date Gardensin  Iraq, and also, on  the  subject of a claim  for  compensation presented by theOttoman  Regie des Tabacs on account of  the  termination of concessionary rights in Iraq. These Notes, the subject-matter of which is not of sufficient general interestto merit circulation to the Cabinet, will also remain unpublished.    6. The negotiations with the Iraq Prime Minister were conducted throughoutin close consultation with the interested Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government,and the Notes constituting the final  settlement were approved by the Chancellor  ofthe Exchequer.  The results achieved may, I  consider, be  regarded  as eminentlysatisfactory.                                                                        P.

APPENDIX A.Sir,                                                 London, August 19, 1930.    WITH reference to our conversations in London, I have the honour to proposethat the following provisions shall be considered as embodying the separate agree-ment on all financial questions referred to in the second exchange of notes betweenyour Excellency and myself at the time of the signature of the Treaty of Alliance onthe 30th June, 1930.    It  is understood that the  agreement constituted by  this note and by yourExcellency&apos;s reply thereto shall be included in the instruments of ratification of theTreaty of Alliance, and shall become operative on the exchange of ratifications.    1.  The Government of  the United Kingdom of Great Britain and NorthernIreland shall  transfer to the Iraq Government,  within the period stipulated in clause 1 of the Annexure to  the Treaty of Alliance signed on the 30th June, 1930,the aerodromes and encampments at Hinaidi and  Mosul at present occupied by theForces of His Britannic Majesty, and the Iraq Government shall accept the transferthereof  (less two &quot; A &quot; type Steel Hangars and the ice plants at Hinaidi and Mosul,to be removed by the Government of the United Kingdom) at one-third of the cost price  certified as correct by  the  Air Ministry of the Government of the UnitedKingdom, of the permanent buildings, plant and structures thereon, no account beingtaken of the mud buildings, which shall be transferred to the Iraq Government free of cost.   The Iraq Government shall pay this sum to the Government of the UnitedKingdom not later than the date upon which the aforesaid transfer is completed.    During the maximum period stipulated in Clause 1 of the  Annexure to  theTreaty of Alliance, the Forces of His Britannic Majesty shall remain in undisturbedoccupation of their present stations  of Hinaidi and Mosul and at  Shaiba, and inthe use  of their existing  emergency  landing grounds, and the Government of  theUnited  Kingdom shall not be called upon  to pay higher rental charges in respectthereof  than those at present paid.    2.  If  upon the withdrawal of the  Forces  of His  Britannic  Majesty fromHinaidi and Mosul in accordance with Clause 1 of the Annexure to the Treaty of alliance, the Government of the United Kingdom should decide to establish a british air base in the neighbourhood of Habbaniya, then the Iraq Government shall take all possible steps, at no cost to either Government,  to arrange for the construction ofa railway to connect such air base with the railway system of Iraq.    3.  The leases of the sites for air bases to be granted to His Britannic Majesty,in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the Treaty of Alliance, shall, in sofar as such sites are on waste Government land, be free of all rental charges, and,in so far as they are on non-Governmental land, every facility shall be given for theiracquisition on reasonable terms, such acquisition being effected by the Iraq Govern-ment at the request and at the cost of the Government of the United Kingdom.  Theleased lands shall be free of all taxes and rates, and the leases shall continue so longas these bases remain in the occupation of  the Forces of His Britannic Majesty, inaccordance with the provisions of the aforesaid Treaty of Alliance or of any extensionthereof.  On the final termination of the leases of the said sites, or of any one ofthem, the  Iraq Government  shall either  themselves take  over the  buildings  and permanent structures thereon at a fair valuation, having regard to the use to  whichthey have been put, or shall afford such facilities as may reasonably be necessary toenable  the  Government of the  United Kingdom to  dispose thereof to the best advantage.    After the expiry of the maximum period stipulated in Clause 1 of the Annexureto the Treaty of Alliance, and so long as the said Treaty of Alliance remains in force the Government of the United Kingdom shall not  be called upon to pay any charges in respect of the use of any of the existing emergency landing grounds in Iraq.    4.   The following arrangements for the disposal and administration of the Iraqrailway system shall be carried into effect as soon as possible, and in any case withina maximum period of one year from the entry into force of the Treaty of Alliance :-    (a) Legal ownership of the railway system shall be transferred by the Govern-ment of the United Kingdom to the Iraq Government and registered in the name of
