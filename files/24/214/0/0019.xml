The  King&apos;s Speech on the  Prorogation of Parliament.                       AUGUST 1ST,  1930.MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE  OF  COMMONS,    MY relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.    It has given Me  great pleasure to welcome  in  My capital  Their ImperialHighnesses Prince and Princess Takamatsu, and to learn from His Imperial High-ness of the gratification which the Emperor of Japan derived from the visit of Myson, the Duke of Gloucester, to Japan last year to  convey to His Imperial majesty the insignia of the Order of the Garter.    At the Conference held at The Hague last January Agreements were concludedfor the definite  settlement of the  reparation  liabilities  of Germany,  Austria,Hungary  and  Bulgaria.   These  Agreements,  together with that  subsequentlyconcluded at  Paris, solved a number of difficult  and delicate problems which haveimpeded the political as well as the  financial progress  of  Europe;  and their conclusion enabled the evacuation of the Fthineland by the Armies of Occupation tobe completed on the 30th June last.  The Hague Conference thus marks a decisivestage in the financial reconstruction and political tranquillisation of Europe and its success has given Me profound satisfaction.    In  January  it afforded  Me  great  pleasure to  open  at  Westminster aninternational conference for the limitation  and  reduction of naval  armaments.After three months of deliberation a Treaty embodying mairy important points ofagreement in regard to the principles  of  naval  limitation  and achieving effectiveeconomies in  the sphere of naval armaments  was signed by representatives of theUnited States of America, France,  Italy and Japan and of  My Governments in theUnited Kingdom, the Dominions and India.   In addition  the Treaty embodies anagreement between My Governments and those of the United States of America and japan fixing for a period a total tonnage limit for certain categories of warships.In this agreement the representatives of France and Italy were unable at the time ofthe signature of the  Treaty  to participate.   The Conference  was  accordinglyadjourned so as to give further time for negotiations, and these will, I trust, resultin a full agreement at no very distant date.    The Optional Clause of the Statute of the Permanent Court of  InternationalJustice was signed at Geneva in September last in respect of the United Kingdomof Great Britain  and Northern Ireland, My self-governing Dominions and India,and the several instruments of ratification are now- completed or nearing completion.    In October last the Prime Minister visited Washington for the purpose of an informal discussion with the President of the United States upon various questionsbearing  on the peace  of  the  world and  an international agreement regardingreduction and limitation of naval  armaments.   Subsequently the  Prime Ministervisited Ottawa.  The very cordial manner in  which he was received caused Me theliveliest satisfaction.    A mission under the Chairmanship of Viscount D&apos;Abernon  was appointed in1929 to  consider Anglo-Argentine  and Anglo-Brazilian relations, industrial, com-mercial and financial, with a view to their development to the mutual advantage ofthe countries respectively concerned.                                                                     (21470)
    The failure  of the recent negotiations  for  an  Anglo-Egyptian  settlementoccasioned Ale sincere disappointment, but I hope that a successful conclusion maysoon be reached.    Diplomatic relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were resumed in December last, and placed on  a normal basis by the appointment of Ambassadors.    I am happy to say that the restoration of more settled conditions in Afghanistanhas enabled Me  to accredit  a Minister to His Majesty King  Nadir Shan, and  toreceive a representative of His Majesty in My capital.    A new Treaty of Alliance between Myself and His Majesty the King of Iraq  toregulate the future relations between Our two countries,  has been signed by our respective representatives.  The text of this Treaty has been laid before you.    I am glad that arrangements have been made for a  meeting of  the  ImperialConference in London at the end of September.   I welcome the opportunities afforded by such  meetings between the  representatives of  My several Governments for the promotion of mutual understanding and of co-operation in  all matters of common concern.  The Expert Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation which met in London last year presented a Report which will come before  the  ImperialConference for consideration.    In accordance with an Address to Me from the Senate  and Commons of Canada,the British North America Act, 1930, has been passed for the purpose  of confirmingand validating certain agreements entered into between My Government in canada and the  Governments of the Provinces of Manitoba, British  Columbia, Alberta andSaskatchewan.    A Conference attended by Governors and other senior officials from the Colonies,Protectorates  and Mandated Territories  assembled in June to discuss matters  ofcommon interest to the various territories of the Colonial Empire.    During the  Session  the Commission  appointed by  Ale in  pursuance of theprovisions of the Government of India Act have completed their  arduous duty andhave  submitted to Ale their  Report, which has been presented to both your Houses.My Government  will shortly be approaching the  task  of framing and submittingfor your consideration proposals for the future government of  India.  For guidance in this  matter, it  is their intention to summon into conference in London represen-tatives  of the wide variety of interests in India.   I earnestly pray that a spirit of mutual  trust  and  friendship  may unite all  races and creeds in  India,  and therepresentatives of both countries, in their discharge of the responsibilities  which the Conference will impose upon them; and I am confident that the single purpose of promoting the welfare of My Indian people will be the inspiration of every memberof the Conference.MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF  COMMONS,    I thank you for the provision you have made for the public service.MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE  HOUSE OF COMMONS,    The high level to which unemployment has risen during the past year and theworld-wide depression in trade is  causing Ale very grave anxiety.  Measures  havebeen passed with the object of promoting works of economic development in thiscountry and in My Overseas Dependencies.  It is encouraging to find that scheme shave been designed to provide useful employment in works of public utility  of atotal value of over  100,000,000.   This has been made possible by a substantial contribution granted by My Government.
    I have given My assent to a further Measure to facilitate more speedy executionof works of this character by local authorities and other bodies.    Reports have been received on the  enquiries undertaken into the condition ofthe iron and steel and cotton industries in order to discover means of improving their position  in the markets of the world, and discussion of the recommendations made  is actively proceeding between all the interests concerned.    A Bill has been passed which amends the Unemployment Insurance Scheme in several important respects, and other legislative measures have  been necessary toprovide for the heavy expenditure on unemployment benefit occasioned by the greatvolume of unemployment.    I have given My assent to a Measure for ameliorating the conditions of minersby  reducing  their  hours  of  labour and  for effecting  an improvement  in theorganisation of the  mining industry.    A Measure, based generally on the recommendations of My Commission on land drainage, has been passed to enable essential comprehensive drainage works to beundertaken for the prevention of flooding and the consequent benefit of agriculture,and the increase of employment in rural areas.    Acts  have also  been passed to make further provision with respect to the drainage of agricultural  land in  Scotland  and to provide additional  monies for improving medical service in the Highlands and Islands.    Steps are being  taken to appoint an Agricultural Research Council,  and withthis purpose in view a Committee of the Privy Council has been appointed.    I have given My assent to Measures to  facilitate the clearance and preventionof slums and  the provision of better housing accommodation, both in urban  and rural areas in Great Britain.    It is My earnest  hope that these  Measures  will  improve the unsatisfactoryconditions under which so many.of My people dwell.    I have given My assent to a  Bill which modifies the  conditions applicable tocertain pensions under the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory pensions act, 1925, and brings some new classes of persons within the benefits of the Act; toa Measure designed to improve and extend the facilities for the treatment of mental illness,  and also to a  Bill  amending and  consolidating the law  relating to the regulation and control of motor vehicles.    In bidding you farewell,  I pray that  the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon the work which you have completed.
