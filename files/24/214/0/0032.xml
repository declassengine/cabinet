July 1930.SECRET.   CP. 2s2 (30).                                  CABINET.Request  from  Afghan  Government  for  assistance,  financial  and    material,  for purposes of reconstruction and re-establishment of    internal order.       MEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.   I circulate for the information  of  my  colleagues copies of telegrams from  theGovernment of India and from His Majesty&apos;s representative at Kabul, on the subjectof a request from the Afghan Government for a cash gift of  400,000, and the supplyfree of charge cf 20,000 rifles with 1,000 rounds of ammunition each, to enable themto proceed  with  the reconstruction of  Afghanistan and the re-establishment  ofinternal order.  A brief historical note  is also appended.   2. I should explain in the first instance  that His Majesty&apos;s Government are already committed by a statement made by Sir Austen Chamberlain, when Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (in reply to a question by the present Secretary of  State for, the  &apos;Dominions), to the grant of assistance to Afghanistan on there-establishment of settledGovernment in that country. -  Theactual terms of Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s statement in the House of Commons on 30th January 1929, were that His Majesty&apos;s Government&quot;will be  prepared, when this [a strong central  Government]  is established, to showtheir friendship for the Afghan people by giving it such assistance as they can in thereconstruction, and development of the country.&quot;  We are, therefore,  committed inprinciple  to  the  grant of assistance,  and the only  question is  on what  scale that assistance should be.  My  colleagues have  already  agreed that our general rulingregarding the supply of  arms to foreign countries does not preclude a gift of arms toKing Nadir Shah. : I would  emphasise,  however, that quite apart from any pledgeswe may have given,  Afghan reconstruction is very definitely in our interest, and thata friendly Nadir at the present difficult time has already meant, and does mean, a verygreat deal to us.                                                         &apos;  .   3. Tt will be seen that the Government of Tndia  and His Majesty&apos;s Minister agree in recommending a very substantial cutting down  of the Afghan request, and that theGovernment  of  India further, strongly urge that Indian revenues ought  not  to  beexpected to bear the cost of  the gift, even in its reduced form.   4.  On the financial question, 1 am prepared to admit, though with reluctance, thatthe charge involved  is one that must be borne by Indian revenues.   f).  On the question of the  character and extent of the assistance to  be  granted tothe Afghans,  and the conditions, if any, to  be attached  to it, I have given anxiousconsideration, in consultation with  my Council, to the arguments in  the telegraphic correspondence circulated with this paper, and to the other relevant material available.I find myself in general  agreement with&apos; the views of the Government of India, saveon certain  relatively minor points with  which  it  is  unnecessary  to trouble  mycolleagues, and I desire to emphasise the position in regard to one  point only.   .    6.  That point is  the  following.   The Government of  India are prepared  to agreethat we should give  the Afghans a cash gift,  though the Government of India  would prefer a  loan free of interest.  1 recognise  that a gift  may be  inevitable.   But Iconsider,  though I am prepared to leave the decision to the Minister, that we should in the  first instance press  the  Afghans to accept the financial assistance proposed as a non-interest-bearing lo/iv.  A  loan will.  not.only be easier to justify  politicallyhere and in India,  but would appear to be definitely in  Nadir Shah&apos;s  own  interest,as making it easier for him  to rebut  any suggestion  that he has  been  bought byHis Majesty&apos;s Government.   But, if the Minister is satisfied that there is no prospectof the Afghans agreeing to  accept  this proposal, or if he thinks that the attachmentof such a  condition would materially lessen the value of the gesture which the assistanceproposed  represents, I would give him  authority to promise a cash  gift.1678   75  7.30
    7. In the light of the above, I recommend for the approval of my colleagues that the following decisions should be taken :     (a)  General. That we should accept in principle  the desirability of granting material and financial assistance to Afghanistan for purposes of reconstruction and the re-establishment of internal order.    (6)  Rifles. That the Afghans should be granted, as proposed by the Government of India, 10,000 rifles with 500 rounds of ammunition each,  if  practicable without scabbards  and  bayonets.  I would leave  the Government of India a  free hand to grant 1,000 rounds of  ammunition  per  rifle if on  further consideration they think this  desirable. . The Government o  India&apos;s proposal that a similar gift should  be contemplated later, if circumstances  render this desirable, to be  approved, but  no commitment on the subject to be entered into with the Afghans at this stage.    (c)  Money.      (i) The amount of the financial assistance to Afghanistan to be fixed at  200,000.         Every endeavour to be  made  by the  Minister to persuade the Afghans to         accept this  as a non-interest-bearing  loan, and  not as a  gift.  Should it         prove impossible to attain this object,  the Minister to be authorised to offer         a gift;    (ii) the cost to  be borne by Indian revenues ;    (iii) the loan or  gift  to  be paid in  two instalments of   100,000,  the second         instalment to be paid after an interval of, say, four  months,  and  to  be         conditional  on Nadir behaving  well  and   conditions  generally  being-         satisfactory.  Before any commitment  is  entered  into by His  Majesty&apos;s         Minister,  efforts  to be made, as  suggested by the Government of India  in         para. 4 of their telegram of 22nd July, and in such manner as the  Minister         thinks best, to reach a clearer understanding  of the  objects  to which the         money is to be devoted ;     (iv) the Minister to make every endeavour  to persuade the Afghan Government         to withdraw their request  for a  sterling credit  in London, and to accept         instead either,             (a) the coinage of Afghan silver currency up to the amounts stipulated           by the Government of India ;  or             (b) the opening of a rupee credit in India or  Kabul ;    (v) the Government of  India&apos;s view  that  secrecy is probably impossible to be         accepted.    (d) In general the minimum in the way of  explicit conditions to  be  attached tothe assistance now proposed to  be  given to Afghanistan.   In general  also theMinisters  tactics,  as  described in  para.  15 of  his telegram  of .14th  July,  to beadopted in this regard.   The  Minister to be left a wide discretion as to  the handling of the desiderata set out in paras. 5 (a) and (b) of the Government of India&apos;s telegramof 22nd July (it will probably be better as regards para. 5  (a) to intimate the purposeof the gift  without requiring an  assurance ; and as regards para. 5 (6),  to indicate,at his discretion, that non-interference with our tribes  is  an underlying assumption of our support in the present case)..  The Minister, however, to make every endeavour,consistently with not  spoiling the effect of the  assistance promised, to  persuade -theAfghan Government  to  meet  us  on air questions on  the lines  proposed  by theGovernment of India in their telegram of the 22nd July.28th July 1930.W.

(Received 17th July 1930.)   Katodon 71.  12tli  July.  Reference  to my Despatches 17, 12th June, and.24,18th June.*  Foreign Minister  to-day specified the requirements  as  100,000 cash,which might be paid to the Afghan Minister,  London, and 20,000 rifles with 1,000rounds of  ammunition  each, method of  delivery  to  be  suggested later if requestgenerally acceptable.  All  to  be free gifts.  In the  case of both cash and  rifles,amount  urgently required  was  half of that specified above.   He said  that dangerthreatened  both Afghanistan and India from the  north and therefore mutual friend-ship and support were  to the interest of both countries.   Afghanistan could not dowithout  the friendship  of  some great Power  and Russia is unprincipled and  notreliable.  Danger to Afghanistan from north, though real, was  not  immediate ordefinite, but general and future.   Present request was made, not  in this connection,but purely  for internal reconstruction and  re-establishment of order.   Russians had refused to  pa3r Amanulla  subsidy due under treaty owing to theirsuspicions  of  him.   These had  been aroused  by his Bokhara intrigue of 1922  and only.allayed by conclusion of neutrality  pact  of 1926, after  which they had  made some payments (corrupt group).   Nadir Shah had  now reaffirmed this pact and demanded from Russia      (i) return of arms taken from Gbulam Nabrs force  on its retirement to Russia        last year ;    (ii)  payment of subsidy due uuder 1921 Treaty or supply of arms in lieu.   Russian Ambassador had inquired &quot;whether Afghan Government were trying toobtain arms from elsewhere, and Foreign Minister had replied  that arrangements for purchase of  arms &quot;were under consideration.    lie had told Ambassador plainly  thatAfghanistan would  get help &quot;wherever she could ;  intended to quarrel with no Power,but would  be friendly and grateful to any which assisted her.  Ambassador had given,vague assurance of  sympathetic consideration,  but  would probably not accede, as hewas  convinced  that Nadir Shah had  concluded  secret treaty  with  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment when passing through North-West Frontier  Province  last year.   Foreign Minister admitted to me that supply of arms by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould not  be kept  secret  indefinitely,   and   said it Avas  for  this reason  he  had(corrupt group) Russian Ambassador for possibility of  such supply represented  aspurchase.   I merely promised  to refer his request.   Comments and  recommendations follow in immediately succeeding telegram.                                        II- &quot;    Telegram from  His Britannic Mu]esti/s Minister,at Kabul to Secretary of State                    for Foreign Affairs, dated 14fA July 1930.                            (Received 15th July 1930.)   Katodon 72.  13th July.   Report military  factors which are  for appreciation  bycompetent authority.   My  comments which   may be read  with the  memorandum annexed to my Despatch No. 17, 12th Juue, are :    1. In view of Chamberlain&apos;s announcement communicated by  Humphrys to NadirShah (vide his telegram 260, 1st March 1929) only  question is as to the amount of thegift and its form.   2. As  it  is  to  be single and non-recurring for exceptional purposes, viz. recon-struction,  limit approved for  yearly  assistance  in normal  and totally  different circumstances is inapplicable.   3. Gift so: small as not to attain main purpose is likely to be even more definitelywaste of money. than one unnecessarily large. &apos;&quot; 4. Nadir Shah  is only man in sight who seems capable of preventing relapse intoanarchy and looks like meeting  our requirements better than airy other possible King.   5. Any assistance  to the  Afghan  Government  involves  gamble  which in thepresent instance might go wrong in the  following ways.   Nadir  Shah  might (a) die before establishing control sufficiently to ensure peaceful succession of the next King;                                   * Not printed.
(b) on obtaining the gift specified as non-recurring, turn against us ; (c)  fall as  theresult of rebellion, iu course of which any arms and money given might come intohands of tribes and so make the situation worse than now.  As regards (a) danger ofassassination is in my opinion real but inevitable and incalculable ; (6)  does not seemprobable since Nadir Shah will always need our  support ;  (c) is  quite possible asresult of either tribal rising, e.g. Ghilzai versus IJurani, Or plot  by malcontents infavour of rival claimant for  the throne.  I  should  expect any such movement to be supported by the Soviet Government.   6. Humphrys was in favour of one crore  of rupees in cash  without  awaitingrequest.   7. Since Humphrys formed this opinion Nadir  Shah has enhanced his  claim onour generosity by his co-operation in connection with the  North-West Frontier crisis,cash value of which to us must  he very great, Baluchistan kidnapping  and  Basawalaeroplane.                        .....   8. Gamble  involved  in gift of  75,000  value  to Amanulla in circumstances ofOctober 1928 would seem to be worse one than gift  now of even much larger sum toNadir Shah.            r &apos;* .....-   9. Objections to a gift of arms on grounds of general disarmament policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, though valid in the case of Amanulla. who had plenty, do not hold good  in present case,  in  which Government  armament  actually required for purpose  of internal security has  not only been lost but has  passed into  hands ofunruly tribes.   All information obtained here  would,  however, show that  there isgenuine shortage of money and arms.   .   10. Belay hitherto in making  gift,  though  involving  some risk, seems  to havebeen justified as having influenced Nadir Shah in right-direction during frontiercrisis.  It  might therefore  be advisable either (i)  to make the gift in instalments,provided that  the  achievement of its main purpose is not thereby endangered, or(ii) when presenting it in single complete amount, to hint at possibility of subsequentlimited material assistance under the principle already approved of subsidy in kind:   11. Reaction  on Russia of our promised gift  to Nadir  Shah  might apparentlytake form of either (a) presentation of similar gift to discount effect  of ours.  Thiswould seem unobjectionable as tending to provide additional funds  for main purpose,viz.  reconstruction,  without further  expense on our part,  or (6) abandonment of diplomatic methods for aggressive tactics  on  northern  frontier.  Risk of this  canhest he  appreciated by His Majesty&apos;s Government in  light of factors not  known tome, but  such tactics would seem to involve exposure of Russian aims, not only in afghanistan, but throughout the whole of the Fast.    12.  Form in which  request was worded by Foreign Minister  may be  regardedas indicating  that  Afghan  Government  really  need  aud  expect  approximately10,000  rifles  and  200,000  sterling, though they would like double  of   both, ofcourse.    13- Period  within which both North-West  Frontier  Province  and  Nadir  Shahshould  reach comparatively  calm waters might perhaps be estimated as next  four months.    14.  My recommendations accordingly are :-(a)  Arms: 10,000 Mark III &apos; 303 with1,000 rounds of ammunition each,.costing  76,000,  or  if  available  and acceptable tothe Afghan Government equal  number of absolutely serviceable rifles of older  type.If whole not available in India first instalment, i.e. those available, to be  deliveredat once and  the balance as soon as possible afterwards spontaneously.   (b) Money :Either (i)  200,000 in  two  instalments, half now  and balance after four months, or else (ii)  150,000 down  with hint of  possible future limited material assistance  (but without indication of sum or approved policy), under the principle of subsidy in kind,e.g. towards air service Kabul-India, and improvement  of the Kabul-Landi Khanaroad, both of which I should  he authorised to mention. Subsidy in kind :  amount might,  on practical grounds, though  perhaps not under  accounts  rules, be reckoned as follows :  after deductions for the year  of  the Legations absence from Kabul,7- lakhs have been  payable&apos; annually  for  seven  years, total 49 lakhs,  of which13^- lakhs&apos; have been expended,  leaving saving available 35-1- lakhs, expenditure ofwhich,  together with the  amount accruing annually, might be spread over several years.  If Government of India agree to make these savings available as suggested,  I
O 9 Q60urecommend (ii), otherwise (i).  I do not. think that the amounts recommended for armsand money would be more than what is required for reconstruction  and interest, or would&apos; be (corrupt group) start from to assume (two corrupt groups) Russia.    15. I  suggest  that before I am informed  of detailed decision of His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment I should be authorised to request an audience of Nadir Shah,&quot; and afterascertaining the wishes regarding type of rifle, para. 14 above, to inform  him thatrequest is accepted in principle, but that  the  amounts  are considered unnecessarilylarge, that a smaller amount of rifles than the maximum specified would  enable himto begin the re-establishment of  control and so recover much of  lost armament, thatwe particularly dislike cash gifts in view  of the Afghan propensity to fritter awaymoney on unproductive and even objectionable objects, emphasising especially our attitude  as regards  his  relations  with our tribes (vide your telegram  No.  G,  dated 1st May&apos;:i:&quot;) and our general  requirements,  stating that  it is (corrupt group) not asconditions of the gift but as  expectation from a gentleman alive to his true  interests.Purpose and non-recurrent character of the present giftp might be made clear at thesame time, and  stress laid upon  the fact that there  is no intention whatever of competition for Afghan favour with third Power, vide brief  prepared, in the ForeignOffice for first interview with Afghan Minister, London.  Requisite padding wouldbe. added. ...... !&apos;        &apos;    -  &apos;-  &quot;  :   &quot; -  111      &quot;               .  &apos; ;  Telegram from His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul to Secretary  of State for                       Foreign Affairs, dated 18th July 1930.                            (Received 23rd July 1930.)    Katodon 76, 18th July.   Katodon 71 and 72.    Foreign Minister has informed me that the Afghan Government would now preferwhole number of 20,000 rifles to be delivered  urgently  from India, but that there is nothing  to  cause, alarm either in internal situation  or external relations.   AfghanGovernment had,  on reconsideration in view of their present weakness and suddennesswith which crises  arise in Afghanistan, decided that speed  was more essential thansecrecjn   I have  no  reason  to doubt  correctness of this explanation, especially as Iunderstand that situation on  northern frontier is clearing up, but it seems probablethat recent events there have alarmed the Afghan Government as  to  the future, while they may now  intend to give  publicity to the receipt  of  any assistance from us inorder to  make  Russia both less  aggressive and more  ready  to  compete  with  HisMajesty&apos;s Government in generosity.   I do  not wish to  modify the recommendationsalready made.                                       IV.    Telegram from Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State                         for India, dated 22nd July 1930.                            (Received 22nd July 1930.)                            (Repeated to Kabul, K. 191.)    2364 S.  Katodon 71 and 72  and your telegram of  the 17th  instant,  2295,* andconnected correspondence relating to  the  proposed air mail line to Kabul and gift of money and arms to Afghanistan. .  2. Both cases  involve financial outlay in or in connection  with Afghanistan inreturn for prospective  political advantages, and  we have  therefore considered themtogether in Council.    3, Our present and  prospective financial  position  gives cause  for anxiety and demands  the  strictest  economy, but we recognise that  in these cases   political considerations may be preponderant.    4. Our position in these circumstances is as follows :-     (a) We are prepared to  commit ourselves to immediate offer as gift to  Nadir of         10,000 rifles Avith 500 rounds  for each, rifle-bayonet and  scabbards  to be         excluded as probably unnecessary.     (?)) We contemplate the possibility of repeating  the gift after  suitable interval         if  this proves necessary, and if  the  conduct  of  Nadir  and conditions in         Afghanistan justify this.   We should, however, prefer to avoid commitment         on this at present.-                                   &quot;Not printed.
(c)  Question of financial assistance is more difficult especially if this  has to be     given,  as  now requested, in the  form of sterling payment in  London.     Afghan Foreign  Minister has  referred  to  common  danger threatening     Afghanistan&apos;and India from Russia  as one amongst  the reasons which have     driven the Afghan Government to apply to  us for help.   Admittedly, it is.     only amongst the remoter causes;  but we feel that the  magnitude of the&apos;     Imperial interests involved, and of the sums named by him, which far exceed     the limits fixed by us in  formulating our policy of subsidy in hind, and the&apos;&apos;     nature  of  the transaction,  which  is  to be  single non-recurring act in     pursuance of Sir A. Chamberlaiii&apos;s assurance, alike warrant the expectation     on  our part  that  the liability is  one for His Majesty&apos;s Government, rather     than  ourselves, to  assume.   However  this may  be, Ave consider That     Maconachie in any  case should, before  committing  us  or His  -Majesty?k     Government, satisfy himself that this method has been suggested for bona     fide reasons, etg. in the interests of secrecy, of for purchasing materials,&apos; or     meeting other legitimate charges  in Europe, and not  to provide nest-egg     for Nadir  and his  brothers in case of developments compelling  Nadirs&apos;     retirement from the  control  of affairs in Kabul.       We must leave it to MaconacluVs discretion to devise means of  satisfying     himself without offending Afghan susceptibilities, hut we  think  he might     reasonably take the Tine that, while we are willing to assist, we are anxious     to satisfy ourselves  that our  assistance will really  meet  the  needs  of the     situation and not lead to further demands, &amp;c.   For this  reason, we might     legitimately expect information  as  to  objects  for which money is required,     and as  to general financial position.  Maconachie could  also suggest that     payment locally in  silver coin would  be more suitable method for us, and     that for this purpose we could either open rupee  credit in India  or Kabul,     or  undertake  coinage of Afghan silver currency.  In any case .secrecy, if     payment has to be met from Indian  budget, seems to be impossible.  Subject     to what Maconachie may ascertain by inquiries on these, lines, our views are     as follows : -          (1) That we should avoid committing ourselves beyond  maximum . of&apos;        200,000 and that  payment, if  possible,  should  be in two instalments.       Second instalment should be dependent on the same conditions as stated       above for rifles.          (2) If Maconachie is satisfied  that bona fide need of Afghanistan can       only  be met by sterling payment  or credits in London,  our argument that       His  Majesty&apos;s Government should undertake the  obligation  is reinforced.       It will be seriously embarrassing to us to have to find sterling now. (d)  If needs can be met by rupee credits or provision of Afghan  silver currency     &quot;there is less  objection to our undertaking the transaction, but we should     prefer to treat it as a loan free of interest, and, in any case, to make payment     by  instalments as and when required.   We can coin Afghan  currency at our     mints or we  can supply silver rupees against rupee credit.   Latter would,     of course, suit us best.5. Subject to above we record following further observations :- (a)  We do  not assume to dictate particular manner  in which the money shall     be  spent, but  would  like assurance  that  it will  be devoted to general     purposes indicated in Article VI of Treaty, viz., creation  of strong Central     Government in Afghanistan. (6)  We should expect  Afghan Government  in return to  adopt generally friendly     attitude,  especially  in matter relating to interference with our  tribes, and     some  conformity  with  usual  international  practice in  this  respect  But     how far it would be expedient to be explicit on  this point is a  matter on     which  we should &quot;like Maconachie&apos;s advice. (c) We should also expect Afghan  Government to meet us over development  of      aerial  communications  to  extent  of refusing concessions to any foreign      concern on  Kabul-Dakka Line,  or similar  line eastwards  from Kandahar,.      and granting  us priority of option of monopoly of operation in this zone. (c?) There may be  other  conditions which we will state in subsequent telegram      if  any occur to us.
    G.  It is on utmost importance to us for strategic arid political reasons that,if air communications are developed by any foreign companies operating from north, Kabulshould become junction  and nodal point in preference to any base further east.  Weare consequently opposed  to Junkers Kabul-Dakka scheme and we  are not preparedto grant facilities to any foreign company in North-West Frontier Province so  long as-we are able to exclude them.  On the other hand,  for reasons  explained below, weshould much  prefer on our own side  to postpone committing ourselves to expenditure involved  in establishment of air mail  line from Rawalpindi  to Kabul.  We  hadcalculated that if  service was to  be operated by contractors,  cost  to  Governmentwould.be R&apos;s.,4 lakhs initial for ground organisation aud Rs. 5 to 6  lakhs recurringfor tw&apos;ice-,vyeekly service,  if service  is to  be operated as part of Indian State AirService,  as we should  prefer.  Revised  estimates  will be necessary, but financial burden involved may be expected to  be somewhere in the same neighbourhood and inany event serious.    Opening of  such line in preference to other lines in India  on which development is urgently needed  on commercial grounds, as against purely  political grounds,  islikely to arouse adverse criticism here. There are also obvious objections to devotingmoney tn this project at the time of special financial stringency when expenditure onnation-building services has to be restricted.  Project is  therefore open to objection on financial and other grounds, and we should prefer that for limited period  no action should be taken by any party to  develop air communications from Kabul eastwards.While agreeing, therefore,  that  Maconachie  should be  authorised, if he  sees noobjection, to  sound  Afghan  Government  as to  its intentions and  put forward ourdesiderata, we would urge him to  endeavour in  the first instance, to utilise opportunityof our giving  assistance with rifles, &amp;c, in order to secure moratorium, and if this is impracticable, to press for priority of option as above, in  which case he would have full authority to negotiate on  basis of twice-weekly service between Rawalpindi andKabul.    In this event, and provided Nadir agrees, we would be prepared to consider fillingparts  of gap that must intervene before complete civil service can be established byutilising the Royal Air Force for occasional conveyance of mails and passengers.  Werinderstand that Nadir is set on developing air communications, and if he really meansbusiness and  insists on development  in the near future for good reasons, we may haveto abandon our plea for  the  present inactivity, and press instead  for monopoly  ofcontrol  of air communications between Eastern. Afghanistan  and  India,  and  the exclusion of  all foreigners.   In  this connection  it  should not necessarily  includeAfghans.          ....    7. Under  Article III  of  Air  Convention,  we  are compelled to permit  privateaircraft  of signatory States only to fly over prohibited  areas  of  North-West frontier province if we permit our own private  aircraft  to do so.  We now hold that thisArticle,  as revised  by Protocol, will allow differentiation in favour of national aircraft,while excluding others.   Additions  to Article embodied  in  the Protocol appear tosupport this view,  but we do  not  regard question of interpretation  of Article III asvital  for  the following reasons: Applications for permission  to fly over  this arenot likely to  be received except  from Germany and Russia who are not  signatoryStates, and  it  is highly  improbable that Russia will ever become  one.    ShouldGermany adhere to the Convention, and should. exclusion under Article III  be  held impossible,  we  would  have  recourse to  Article  15  of  the Convention which,  asinterpreted at  the recent  Conference,  we think  provides  protection against  theestablishment  and  operation of international  air-way  over  North-West   frontier province without our consent.  Papers dealing with  this aspect of the question willbe sent  by air mail as soon as possible. .    8. We will deal separate^ with problem arising from supply of rifles in quantitiesindicated to Afghanistan,  and their replacement in our reserve.    9. This telegram was drafted before  the  receipt  of  the 4th and  5th parts of Katodon 72  which  are very &quot;badly  mutilated.  We are,  however,  not delaying  its&quot; despatch as we are in general agreement with Maconachie&apos;s proposals.
Historical Note.    This is not the first time that this  question has  arisen, ils history in recentyears being briefly as follows :     Until the Third Afghan War in 1919 the Government of India paid the Amirof Afghanistan an annual subsidy of 18 lakhs of rupees (about  110,000).  Since 1919both His iVIajesty&apos;s Government  and the Government of India have held that in no circumstances should a  subsidy be renewed  or any attempt made, by recurring giftsof money or arms, to compete with the Soviet Government (see para, below) for  thoiavours  of  Afghanistan.   It has been  generally recognised,  however, that, specialcircumstances might render desirable an occasional gift, which would not be regardedas a precedent.    In 1921 the  Soviet Government signed a  treaty by which they undertook to paythe  Afghan  Government  an annual   subsidy  of  1,000,000 gold roubles  (about 100,000), as well as giving them a variety of arms and  equipment.   Even in KingAmantillah&apos;s time this subsidy was some years in  arrear and according to the AfghanGovernment there is no prospect  of the Soviet Government fulfilling their engagementat present.    Gifts of money and arms being in general ruled  out, His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Government of India  eventually agreed that  the  best  way of assistingAfghanistan  was to supply her with material  and  technical assistance  for suchconstructive works  as roads, telegraphs, possibly railways and air services, and  so forth ; and in 1925 the Government  of  India undertook to meet the expense of thispolicy, known as the ;&apos; subsidy in kind,&quot;  up to a maximum of 7 lakhs of rupees (about 50,000) annually.  There was of course no question of telling the. Afghan Governmenthow much it was  proposed to spend.   For various  reasons, however, none of  themoney available for this  policy had been spent up to  the time of  King Amanullah&apos;stour abroad in 1927-8.                         ;    Prior to King Amanullah&apos;s arrival in  England in March 192S the Government ofIndia  agreed that the visit -was a suitable; occasion for  a complimentary gift of armsand undertook to provide  12,000 for this purpose out of the money available for thesubsidy  in kind.                                 &apos;  ...  Sir &quot;Austen Chamberlain accordingly informed the  acting Afghan Foreign Minister,who was travelling with the King and made a definite request for assistance in arms,that though the jefforts  of all Governments  were directed  towards the reduction ofarmaments,  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  would be prepared to assist  within, modestlimits;.  They would also receive  some Afghan cadets  at Sandhurst.    The  exact form of this assistance was the  subject of much subsequent discussion,but in October 1928 Sir Francis  Humphrys, His Majesty&apos;s Minister  at  Kabul, was authorised to inform the Afghan  Government in writing that they would receive      (a)  3 batteries of artillery.            - &apos;     (6)  3 armoured cars.     (c)  6 machine guns. .    (d)  .1,000 rifles with 100,000 rounds of ammunition.    Owing  to the  outbreak  of the Afghan  rebellion, however, this gift was never- delivered.  The  cost would have  been  much higher  than the  12;000: originallysuggested.         &apos;.  &apos;                                  .           ...... ;   On 30th January 1929, while the rebellion was in progress, Sir Austen Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons that His  Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared,when a  strong central Government was re-established in Afghanistan, &apos;&quot; to show theirfriendship for the Afghan people-, by giving them  such assistance as. they can in  the reconstruction and development of the country.&quot;  .            , &quot; &apos;  \: &apos;  When  King.Nadir Shah came to the throne in November 1929,.-His.-.Majesty&apos;s. Government and the Goveruinent of India discussed  the advisability-of ah.immediate- advance of  money  to. help the  new King-&quot; over the first months of  his&quot; reign.&apos; As a.result the Government,of India were ready, if the King asked for assistance,1 to.-make an.advance of Rs. 7 lakhs (about  50,000) or one &apos;yeai&apos;&apos;s allowance for the subsidy in kind.   Veiled attempts were even made to induce thedSing to ask for such assistance,. but he did not do so until June 1930.      -
