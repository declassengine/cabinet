 $A DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS ERITANNIO MAJESTY&apos;S QOVBRMMSjHT.Seoret.                                                  \()&quot;291(30)                                 Oo-py No._                           CABINET*                       STATE OP TRADE           according to Reports made at the meeting of           the Board of Trade Advisory Council on           6th August, 1930.      Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.     The general trade depression continued during July and the seriousness of the situation was emphasised by the unemployaentfigure passing the two million mark on July 28th, for which the exact figure was 2,011,467, an increaso of 120,000 since june 30th last.   This figure represents 16.7% of the total numbers insured and is comparable, sub^sot to certainqualifications in connection with the extension of the olassesinsured, with the figure of 1,154,129 for 12 months ago.     Unemployment is most serious in t he coal and cottonindustries.  In the former the percentage of unemployed is23.8.  Coal production continued to fall during July and -was practically at the rate of 1,000,000 tons less per week than ayear ago.-  Export trade from this country continues to maetwith keen competition from Polish coal which is offered at very low prices and from German coal which is assisted by further reductions in railway rates.   The coal industry is anxiouslyawaiting the drawing up of new schemes under the new Coal mines act, and forward business remains quiet.     No improvement was reported in the iron and steel tradeand even in the tinplate trade, in whioh work had been fairlywell sustained,  there has been a falling off in orders.  during july 24 blast furnaces were blown out and 3 damped down.  the closing down of the Port Glarenoe Works was symptomatic of theposition on the North East coast, as the earlier closing of works
at Dowlaid Merthyr had been of the position in South Wales.Indian and Continental pig iron continued to be imported,particularly for Scotland.  Deoreasea prgduotion of steel was common to the -whole of Europe except France, and attempts atprioe regulation were breaking down in faoe of the extremelysmall demand.     The position in the shipbuilding industry, is uncertainthough the opinion was expressed that in September there mightbe a renewal of oonfidenoe.  There was a discouraging lack ofnew orders and none for any ordinary oargo boats.  In shippingthere were slight signs of improvement in certain tradesthough these were not strong enough or early enough to affeotsensibly the Chamber of Shipping freight index which remained at about 22-^ below 1913 *  The volume of laid-up tonnageremained practioally the same in July as in April though a fewvessels have now been moved.     Railway traffio reoeiptB for July were  1,200,000 lessthan for July, 1929, whilo for the first 30 weeks of the presentyear the total decrease as compared with the oorrespondingperiod for 1929 was  4,330,000.  The heaviest proportionaldecreases for July were in the passenger receipts, 5.3$, andin the heavy mineral traffic where pig iron was down by as muchas 17,6?S and coal by 1$.  Iron ore, brioks and limestoneshowed increases of about 5 ,.     The motor industry was reported to be worse during Julythan for many years, the unemployment proportion being as muchas 28fc,  New registrations in June, 1930, showed a decreaseas compared with June, 1929, of over 5,500 vehicles, chiefly(5,100)oars taxed on horse power.     The non-ferrous metal market is comparatively favourable,except for zinc.Some other authorities reported an upward tendency in July
    The demand for heavy chemicals is for use in otherindustries and this side of the chemical industry is thusnecessarily suffering from depression.   In the export trade,however, the industry is holding its own against foreigncompetition and satisfactory progress is being made in theproduotion of fine chemicals.     The wheat position is dominated by the crisis in Americawhere the United States Farm Board, having spent heavily inpurohasing and holding last years&apos; crop against better prices would appear reluctant to undertake a similar liability withregard to the new crop.     It was reported by the representative of the Go-operative movement that the first samples of the new crop of Russianwheat had been received and were very fine, being a great improvement on the cleanness and quality of past years.It was considered that the new Russian crop would thuscompete favourably with Canadian wheat.   The position in theArgentine was steady,  Australia was further increasing herwheat acreage and India trying to export more wheat.     The state of the cotton trade remained during July oneof severe depression;  there was lack of confidence in theprice of raw materials;  very few orders were received.  Inaddition to the disturbed state of India and China, the slump in rubber has made the cotton markets in the Dutch Sast Indiesana other rubber producing countries very quiet.     In the wool trade, where the dispute is now practicallyover in all seotiono, the manufacturers are placed in afavourable position in two respects;  the price of the rawmaterial has now been stabilised and wages have been reduced;and there is some expeotation of improved demand in the autumn.As regards the price of wool, it was reported that theShearers&apos; Union had accepted a recent arbitration Awardreducing wages.
 r           As to retail trade, Co-operative sales in drapery,      woollens, footwear and furnishing show a heavy decrease  for      July, but this is partly compensated for by increased sales      in other departments.    Other retail store trade v/as      generally below last year.    This was partly due to the  fact      that the fall in the prices of raw materials was now more      largely reflected in those  of manufacturered articles but      trade was affected not only by decreased prices but also by      more cautious buying.Board of Trade, 26th August, 1930.

CONFIDENTIAL.MEETING OF THUS BOARD OF TRAPS ADVISORY  COUNCIL            ON 6th AUGUST,  1930.     MR.  WALTER SMITH:   Gentlemen,  the President isdelayed for the moment  hut I do not think we need wait.   Hewill come in later.*COAL.     MR, RIDLEY WARHAM:  The output of coal in the UnitedKingdom was for the week ended July 5th 4,278,000 tons;  for thatended July 12th 4,192,000 tons and for that ended July 19th4,177,000 tons and for the week ending 26th July it  fell to3,933,000 tons.   These figures are all nearly one million tons per week less than the output during the earlier part of thisyear.   The average for the thirteen weeks ended 19th July was,383,000 tons as compared with 4,804:COO tons for thecorresponding period of last year.   The number of personsemployed in the industry for the week ending July 19th was897,600j  the average for the thirteen weeks was 924,800 ascompared with 935,800 for the corresponding period of last year.Unemployment for the month of June was 23.8 per cent as against22.1 per cent in May and only 13.2 per cent last February.   Thequantity of coal exported in June from the United Kingdomexcluding exports to the Irish Free State was 3,887,000 tons ascompared with 4,855,000 tons in May, that is a million tons less.The value per ton was 16/4d in June as against 16/6d in May.     The exports by sea from Poland in May were 643,000tons, in June 613,000 tons.   Polish competition remains verykeen and low prices are being taken.   The exports from Dantzigand Gdynia for the six months ended June this year amounted to3,843,000 tons, an increase over any similar period  in the past.     In regard to the present position of the British coal trade there exists a great deal of uncertainty and suspensepending the formation of the District and National schemes underthe new Act.   Business remains very quiet.   Coal is difficultto sell, and there is still a large amount of idle time in alldistricts.   A further disturbing influence in competition forexport is the reduction of the German railway rates  towards thesea-board.   In the meantime all districts are occupied in preparing new schemes in accordance with the Act.     That is all I have to say this morning, Sir.   Iam afraid the outlook at the moment is somewhat depressing.     MR. WALTER SMITH:  The figures for coal seem to be muchmore proportionately down than the figures of unemployment areup.   Is it because of the holiday period?* The President was unavoidably detained  elsewhere.
     MR. RIDL3Y WARHAM:  During the week of the 26ththe Scottish holidays would have an affect,  hut taking the weeks of July 5th, 12th and 19th,  they are all  just  abovethe four million ton mark instead of being about the fivemillion tons mark which they were at the beginning of thisyear.   That shows better than anything else the difficulty that we are having at present to get orders;  in fact,  wecan hardly sell coal for export today in the North ofEngland and in our own collieries we are giving notice thisweek to close down two pits.   V/e cannot keep them working at the present moment.WOOL.     ALDERMAN TITTERINGTON:   My report will be equallybrief.   Since my last report the power loom overlookers whowere in dispute have returned to work without an agreement which means the termination of the wages dispute in the wooltextile industry.   Partly as a result of this, there hasbeen a slight increase in activity in most sections of theindustry, but there is still a very large amount ofunemployment and short time.   Wool values after droppingalmost to the lowest point of the year, have shown a slightrecovery in fine sorts.   There seems to be no outstandingaccumulation of wool supplies, and the wool textile industrystands in a rather favourable position in two respects -raw material values have been fairly well stabilised, and wages have been reduced.   I mention lower wages as afavourable factor out of deference to my manufacturingfriends, who regard it as essential.   My own views on thesubject are slightly different.   Unfortunately, financial conditions in the industry are rather strained at the moment.Certain financial arrangements have had to be made by two large firms of piece merchants and two important firms ofworsted spinners.     I am hoping that before the end of the year therewill be some reduction in unemployment in the industry, butit looks as if the recovery will be a very gradual process.CESHIOALS     MR. WALTiSR SMITH&apos;.  I will now ask Dr.  Clayton forhis report.   I should like to welcome him as a new memberof our Committee and as a very old friend of my own.     DR. CLAYTON:  I have no written statement for thismeeting,   I hope at the next meeting to have a full statement on the chemical situation, but in regard to the chemical trade, the heavy chemical trade especially, weare merely raw material makers for the other industries sowe are bound to suffer when there is a slackness in otherindustries.   We are in a position to make vastly larger quantities than we are at present making,  and in regard  toforeign business we are holding our own with our foreign competitors, but we are suffering, as must be apparent toeverybody, from the fact that our customers are working.
f1)3short time.    In regard to the other branches  of the industry,the fine chemical portion, I have no statement to maketoday,  hut I understand the position is  very much the sameas reported last month, namely that they are makingsatisfactory progress.OO-OFSRATIVS TRADE.     MR. VARLEY:  Mr. Chairman, I have to report todayrather differently from what I previously have reported.    Ithink I have usually said our sales and money values werekeeping up; today I have to say they are down.  I find oursales (i.e., for the 4 weeks to July 19th) are down by abouta quarter of a million, but drapery, woollens, boots andfurnishing are down over  400,000 so that the sales in other articles together have increased compared with three months ago.   There has been some slight modification in price;  forinstance, butter has gone up.   In the early days of themonth it was up about 5/- a cwt. and in the latter daysanother 6/- so that will find an alteration in the counterprice in all probability - I am speaking now of Danish.New Zealand has ruled steady and Australian and Irishcreamery have gone up about 3/-;  still the prices of butterare less today than they were a year ago;  Danish 16/-,Swedish 13/-, Finnish 15/6d, New Zealand 34/6d, Australian33/- and Irish Creamery 26/- less than in July 1926.   3ggs,another interesting item, are going up in price at themoment.   Danish are moving very freely, but they areselling at about sixpence a hundred - 120 go to the hundred -below Irish.   Polish are meeting the demand for cheap eggsat the moment.    Sugar, which was anticipated as a possibilityfor advance has not advanced, but declined.   For canned goods which form a large portion of the food of the working classes in winter time particularly, I think I told you last month,the prices were not yet fixed.   They had not been fixed atthe end of July.   Brisline has been a failure so far, but the september and October fishings are-expected to improve.  Asfar as salmon is concerned, Canadian pack is much greater;Siberian not so good;  Alaska poor,  but the opening prices have not yet been fixed.   In canned meats the sales areslow and prices easy.   Then again in canned fruits,Calixornian prices for the 1930 pack have not yet been fixed.   backers have agreed to limit the packing of peachesthis season and the unsold balances of last year&apos;s smallpack have been offered below cost by packers to get clearedbefore this season&apos;s pack is ready.    In pineapples the low prices of Singapore have caused South African and Hawaiianto be neglected.     The tea market has been characterised by a firmertone during the month.    The quality of Ceylon offerings  hasbeen generally inferior and prices have declined accordingly.The quality of the Indian teas has been irregular, andirregularity has prevailed owing to the fact that so muchof last season&apos;s teas have been offered.   Java and Sumatrasales have met with fair support and realised steady ratesfor most descriptions.    China teas have been in good demand.supplies of old season&apos;s continued in limited compass.Bacon and hams have gone to a lower price this month,  about/- lower, but the market is becoming firmer under holidayconditions and the somewhat reduced supplies.   In regardto potatoes, the Jersey season has just finished and it has
been a disastrous season for them owing to the early appearancein the Jersey crop of disease asinand went down.  They could notkeep up the quality and the prices of the Jersey crop have been less than for the last fifty years.  It has been a disastrousseason for the Jersey people.  On the other hand, the St. Malostuff, that is from Brittany, has been good and it has very largely ta:cen the position of the Jersey potato during thelast season.  At the moment supplies are being drawn fromLincolnshire and Lancashire, so far as we in the North areconcerned, and from Cheshire, and the stuff is quite good, buton the light side.  In soft fruit, in spite of the adverse weather, there have been abundant supplies of English blackcurrants, raspberries and gooseberries which are coming inuseful for the jamming season and I suppose we shall have theresult of that during next winter and spring,  x-rices have beenvery low, in fact equal to pre-war values.  In regard to imports, Continental plums and &apos;gages have arrived freely andpears will arrive in increasing quantities.     So far as wheat is concerned, since our last report the liverpool market has kept steady, whilst Chicago and Winnipeghave declined a little and Argentina is unchanged.  In Canada thenew crop is making fair progress and on present showing shouldturn out much better.  In the U.S.A. the Farm Board do not seemas yet to be making any progress in trying to get higher prices for their wheat;  the law&apos;of supply and demand is still against them and they are hesitating to throw away any more millions of dollars in bolstering up the prices of wheat.     I mentioned during the last two months the possibility ofRussia coming in.  The first ssanples of the Russian new crop havearrived and according to my reports the samples are of very finequality.  Russia has been noted in the past for her mixed lot of wheats, mixed with other cereals, barley, cockle and other things including dirt.  They have been trying, they have keptassuring us they were trying and were getting a new seed whichwould produce cleaner wheat and would be of better quality,  tfehave been a bit doubtful about it; we could not tell until thesamples came and according to our first reports the new cropshows very fine quality nnd competition with Canada seems likelyto be severe.     In Australia there is a still further increase of acreageunder wheat and they seem determined to keep their place asexporters.  India is anxious to do more trade, but is not satisfied with the prices prevailing.  Argentine is keeping steadyas the balance of the old crop is not heavy and the new crop is going well and promises quite satisfactorily.     So far as milling offals are concerned, prices arehardening a little and I might thank you for the literature yousent me on the pig breeding trade and pig population which I mentioned at the last meeting.  It makes very interesting reading and I think if circulated it will do something towards helping the pig population and bacon industry.   I find we are importingsomething like a million pounds worth a week of bacon products and, I think sometimes, surely this country should be able tosupply itself with a very large part of that with the amount ofmilling offals there are and the amount of other kinds ofsupply which are coming into consumption.
     MR. WALTER. SMITH;  Do you say boots and shoes aredown very much?     MR. VARL3Y:  Boots and shoes are down, quite alarge amount.     Trade generally In coal has been in a bad condition.According to my reports it is the greatest slump - I amspeaking now of domestic coal - the greatest slump in tradein the recollection of men with long experience.   A fewcollieries are adhering to the prices arranged by the marketing Board, but others have slumped prices in the hopeof temporarily clearing stocks as there is no demand, butthis move has been fruitless.     As to the exports which we send to Oo-operativeorganisations in other countries in Uurope and America, I  donot know that there is anything interesting except Russiawhich is usually interesting;  during the month we haveexported to that country metals, tin end lead, to the valueof  20,000 and we have exported woollen cloth from ourBradford and Buckfastleigh mills to the tune of  10,087 andspices from our Silvertown factory to the tune of  7,042.     MR. WALTER SMITH:  Do I understand your sales ofcoal from the Co-operative Societies have gone down?     MR. VARL^Y:  Domestic coal, yes, during the month.     MR. WALTTJ1R SMITH:  Is that compared with last year or theprevious month.     MR. VARLEY:  As compared with three months ago theyare down 1.3 per cent, but it is an increase on twelve months ago.   It Is a decrease compared with recent months.   It  hasbeen rather surprising how they have kept up in recent months, but this month, July, there has been a big slump.     MR. WALTLiSt SMITH: Can you tell me whether yourorganisation is doing any trade at all in canned vegetables?     MR. VARL3Y.  Canned fruits, yes;  canned vegetables,no.     MR. WALTER SMITH:  I did not know whether that hadbeen developed.   I saw some being used this week and they came from Belgium.   I knew they had started canning peas atWisbech and I wondered if any of those people were doing anything.   What I saw were mixed vegetables.     MR. VARLEY:  I am not aware of any.   I will pass yourenquiry on.     MR. WALTER SMITH:  I wondered if there was a salein this country.     MR. VARLEY:  I think allotments will upset that.With so many allotments people can get their own vegetables.     MR, WALTER SMITH:  Are the new potatoes fetching agood price?     MR. VARLEY:  Not a very good price.
11A.RINS MQINEERING.     MR. RICHMOND:  In marine engineering there is nothing of an encouraging nature to report.    Employment continueshad and has declined in the past month.    In all centres  the cessation of orders has been marked.    The holiday period inthe North j  of course, lias just come to an end and in manyestablishments has been more protracted than usual.    It  is perhaps a little surprising to find from a statement that hasbeen put before us that the vessels under construction inthe United Kingdom are about the same as last year at the sameperiod, but I think that is accounted for by the large numberof tankers that were placed earlier in the year, but the  demandfor that type of tonnage seems to have exhausted itself.    the enquiries in the market are very few indeed and altogether Imay say that the outlook is less encouraging than it has  been at any time during the year.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.     MR. JOHN SANDERSON:  I have no official advices thismonth from Australia, but August is always the time of yearwhen everything is quiet in commercial, pastoral and agricultural circles.     Wool shearing is now starting.   An important point isthe acceptance by the Australian Workers Union of an arbitration Court of Award whioh has fixed a considerable reduction in the shearers wages.   There have been some furtherrains in the pastoral and agricultural portion of theCommonwealth and these have all helped to improve the outlook.     The position at Broken Hill is rather uncertain at presentowing to a very heavy fall in the price of metals.   an adjustment of working costs is now being attempted so that workcan be continued   but there have been stoppages of some of the mines and I have ho further advice as to what the presentposition is.     As regards finance, Sir Otto Niemeyer has recently arrived in Australia and is now in consultation with theCommonwealth and State financial authorities.     Last month I was asked a question in regard to fruitshipments from Tasmania, where shortage of shipping space hadbeen indicated.   I have been making some enquiries about that.I cannot find that there is any material export of dried fruitsfrom Tasmania, so the question probably referred to freshfruits.   Ordinary liners with refrigerated space go intoTasmania in the ordinary course for fruit and apart from theseliners, there would be difficulty in obtaining shipment fromTasmania cut of the usual season because there is no regularconnecting service between Tasmania and the mainland;  there might have been some difficulty,.but I was unable to tracethat there actually had been.                   SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.     SIR ERNEST GLOVER:   Since my last report  there has beena little more activity in some directions.   The slightvariations have not been sufficient  to alter the freightindex number which remains at about  22 to  23 per cent under
1913.  The slight improvement that there has been is sorecent that possibly it has not yet found its way into theIndex number,  improvement has been shown in homeward businessfrom the Argentine where owing to a demand for prompt tonnagerates of freight have advanced though they cannot yet besaid to be on a paying basis.   Similarly in Australia therehas b^en as.  advance owing to scarcity of early tonnage andnew season^ rates have improved in sympathy.  In Canada and north America there has been more business doing - I amreferring to export business - and rates have improved.  Indiaremains particularly dull.  The hopes for further wheatshipments from Karachi have not materialised and charteringfrom both sides of India is in a state of stagnation.  Outwardshipments are still being considerably interfered with by the boycott.  Outward coal freights to South Amerioa have fallenapproximately in proportion to the advance In the homewardmarket.  In other directions outward freights have remainedstationary.     In regard to shipbuilding the records show very feworders placed.  They include a steamer for the Seuth african government, a large tank steamer and a passenger steamerfor New Zealand, but no orclJLriary cargo boats.  In regard tolaid up tonnage, a few vessels have moved, tempted by theslight advance in homeward rates, but there is no generalamelioration of position which on the 1st July was worse thanon the 1st April,  I have not got figures for the 1st August.     In regard to tonnage building I am putting in the usualstatistics^ whioh show an increase in tonnage launched, but aconsiderable decrease both under the heading of tonnage under construction and tonnage commenced.     Shipment of coals for June is down a million tonB, thatis to say, SO per cent, less than in May, and 800,000 tons&quot;which Is about 17 per cent. less than in June of last year-/Shipment of bunker coals for June is down by about 200,000tons, that is to say, about 13 per cent, as compared with May,I am sorry I have no better report to present.                         IRON AND STEEL.     MR. PUGH; There is nothing favourable to report in theIron and Steel industry at present.  Your own figure ef theproduction of crude steel for Jvne aB compared with the previousfigures is an indication of the downward trend in that direction&apos;&apos;&quot;;As far as we can see those figures are not likely to show animprovement.  For the past month from reports I have got I am advised that employment in all sections of the industry, withthe possible exception of the tin plate trade, has been bad.  InScotland, where the Glasgow holiday week has taken place in thatperiod, there has been an extension of -that week in a number ofinstances.  In regard to blast furnaces there has be^n a furthercurtailment and Indian and Continental pig iron is beingimported, particularly we understand for the Scottish works.  the closing down of the Port Olarence Works, Dorman Long and Company,one of the principal heavy steel manufacturers in the country,is an indication of the condition of the heavy steel trade onthe North  East coast as was the earlier closing down of the**See Appendix p.14,     /See latest Statistical Bata at end.
 larger&quot; part of the Dov/lalu Lerthyr Works in the more southerly district.  Short tine is being worked in the finished iron section, with perhaps the exception of the manufacture of marked bars.  There has been little, if any, improvement in the steel trade.  A substantial number of mills remain idle, ar; far  as v/e can see with little prospect of an early restart,  Ac I have said tin plate workers, with the e&quot;:c3ption of the general stoppage, have been fairly well employed, but our latest reports are there has been a slackening off in orders.  The tube trade and other finished branches remain very depressed.  A3 I say our general report is not one to awaken any enthusiasm, but it is one we have become accustomed to.  We hope it will improve in due course, but when we do not know.     MR, WALMSLEYi  I am afraid I have very little to add to what Mr. Pugh has told you.  Owing to the early date of our meeting this month I have not got actual statistics for July, but there is no doubt that the July figures will be very disappointing and very much worse than the June figures.  I can tell you that during the month of July twenty seven blast furnaces have either been blown out or damped down which is a very big proportion.  In regard to the figures for the first six months of the year I happen to have some totals here which confirm what I mentioned a month ago, namely that the decrease in output is general over the whole of Europe at any rate.  For that period&apos;the total output of the Continental countries which produce steel Was over two million tons les^ in 1930 than it was in 19S9.  That is a reduction of about llf- per oent.   The only country which showed an increase was France and that was very slight.  The United Kingdom figures for the six months show a decline of 521,000 tons compared with last year which is nearly 11 per cent.  The price situation on the Continent remains rather chaotic,  I think I mentioned last month that there had been a very heavy fall in Continental prices and in spite cf their efforts to form selling syndicates they do not seem to have been able to steady those prices at all.  The demand is so extremely small it is almost impossible at the present time to do anything in the way of prioe regulation,  w&quot;e have no figures but we assume that during the last two months, perhaps three months, a considerable tonnage of steel of various kinds has been put into stock on the Continent,  I should think their stocks are very heavy today.  I have a short statements- hore which I will hand in,     MR $ WALTER SMITH:  Well, gentlemen, that is the conclusiona? the reports.     It was understood there would be no meeting in September, In the ordinary way  the meeting in October would be on the 8th, I do not know whether that is agreeable or if there in airy suggestion in regard to it,     I nfo reminded that it would be useful if the reports for September could be sent in DO that thoro is continuity of ivaforaation in the department.     There ia a point as to whether sor.e other day of the week would bo found convenient for the meeting, but I think we had better leave it tentatively for 8th October.  If there is any alteration reasonable notice ./111 be given of it,                   - (The proceedings terminated).ttSee appendix p. 9
3 ft Q v o  APPENDIX.General Trade.,     SIR WALTER RAINS  sent  the  following report     Goal Trade;   The position with regard  to Steam Goals in particular, ha3 become steadily worse during  the past month.   Gas Goals have been  falling,  particularly best qualities,  and the Genoa Gontraot for  30,000 tons of Thornley was taken at  a price which  will not leave more than 15/- F.o.b. for that Goal,  which is  one  of the Wear Specials.

Out of the  difference  has to  he paid Hartlepool  Dues, amounting to  d per ton, Agents Commission in Genoa - possibly -gd per ton  - and six weeks  Credit, because payment takes place one month after  the arrival of the steamer, so that means actually more than six  weeks before the money is received in this oountry.

Shiprepairinfl;  There  is a fair amount  of this work on the North-East coast.     Shipbuilding:  This is unfortunately tapering Off and as the  vessels are being  launched,- for the most part there are no orders to replace them.     Generally speaking, there  is a  feeling  of uncertainty and hesitation.  Probably with  the advent of September, wemay find a  renewal of  confidence, if for no  other reason than an almost rule of thumb  argument, namely -&quot;commodity prices are  so low $aid  goods are being  produced at a loss -and that cannot go on  for ever.  Therefore,  things are boundto improve&quot;.  There is no doubt that with cheap  money, andeven a slight restoration of  confidence,  the whole positionwould quickly change,  and we  might see at any rate a cessation of the increase of the Unemployed figures.                       IRON AND STEEL.     MR. WAL:&amp;;LEY handed in the following report:-     During the past month the position of the iron and steelindustry has definitely become worse.  To some extent themormal seasonal decline and the holiday influences inScotland and the Korth of England have been responsible forthe dullness of trade, but demand generally has been verydisappointing and the volume of orders booked has beeninsufficient to maintain a satisfactory rate of operation.No production figures for July are as yet available, but it isknown that since July 1st there has been a decline of atleast 27 furnaces in blast:  24 furnaces have been blown out and 3 have been damped down.
     Conditions generally on the iron and steel export marketsare depressed, and the general feeling of weakness has been intensified by the decision of the International SteelCartel to release all control of prices of bars, hoops andplates,  as a result of the CartelTs failure to controlthese products prices slumped, ard at one period prices of finished products were out of aD i gnment with the prices of semi-finished material.   The new selling syndicates forsemi-finished material and girders, however, which beganoperation on August 1st, reduced prices by amoxrnts varying from 5/-  to 7/- per ton.  It is hoped that the coming intooperation of these new selling syndicates may help tostiffen the general tone of the mar Ice t, and that the presentexceptionally low level of prices may lead to a stimulationof demand.    It is doubtful, however, whether output in the chiefsteel producing countries on the Continent during the first six months of the current year v/as reduced to the extentrequired by the general lack of demand in most steel-consumingcountries.  It is feared that, if supply has not been properly adjusted to demand, stocks may be unusually heavyin some cases, and in view of this possibility many consumersare not convinced that the bottom of the market has yet beenreached.   The dominating weakness on steel markets atpresent is this lack of confidence in the prioe level.Consumers continue to hold off the market in the anticipationthat later on they may be able to obtain still lowerquotations.   A definite improvement in demand may beanticipated as soon as the belief is general that prices have touched bottom.     The general position in the chief districts in the UnitedKingdom during the past month is summarised below:-     North ffast Coast.  During the past month it has become clear that the slump has been more severe than was anticipated.  In spite of the reduction that has taken placein output supply still remains sufficient to meet all needs.Heavy stocks of hematite are reported to be accumulating asa result of the lack of demand.     In the steel trade there is a pronounced scarcity ofnew order*s and the outlook: is uncertain.   The demand forsheets is well below normal, although a slight Improvementhas been noted recently.  The iaanufacturers of structuralsteel are stated to have a fair amount of orders in hand.     Scotland. Generally speaking manufact\rrers have littlework in hand and few enquiries are coming forward.  In manycases the holidays have been extended owing to the  scareitjrof business.  The demand from shipbiiilders and structuralengineers is disappointing, and export trade in general isstagnant,  Manufacturers of black and galvanised sheets arepessimistic regarding the future outlookj  specifications forthe home trade being poor and export business being of onlymoderate dimensions.     South yales.   The situation is very unsatisfactory and  demand  continues to decline;  even in oases where orders have been booked the works are handicapped by lack ofspecifications.and delivery instructions.  Most of the worksproducing heavy steel are reported to be idle, and theprospects of a re-start are not bright.
     Enquiries for tinplates have been poor and buying has been on a hand-to-mouth basis.    The demand for galvanised  sheetshas also been on a low level.     Sheffield District.    The volume of business on the  steelmarket has been very small and has been still further  restricted by the approach of the holiday season.   Although demand  for ordinary steel has been poor, however, an encouraging  volume  ofbusiness in most of the special steels is reported,  stainlesssteel in particular being a good feature.NON-FERROUS METALS.     CAPTAIN LYTTELTON sent the following report:-     Copper:  There has been a fair amount of Copper buying,chiefly at concessions in the Association price, butconditions are still quiet.   Lately wiredrawers  in Liverpoolhave taken a considerable tonnage, mostly forward, whichwould indicate prospects of increased activity later in theyear.     Tin:  Consumptive demand here continues  moderate,and not unsatisfactory in comparison with that in  Americaand on the Continent.     Lead:  Lead continues to be in quiet but steady demand in this country.    Gable makers have bought and are shortlyexpected to take even larger quantities,  and  further enquiryfrom Pipe and Sheet makers in Liverpool is also anticipated.     Spelter:  The Spelter consuming industries are still  verydepressed and demand remains poor.   The galvaniser&apos;s positionis no better, with hand-to-mouth working and  no programmeeven for two or three weeks ahead.MOTOR INDUSTRY.     SIR WILLIAM MORRIS sent the following Report:-     Although July is normally a period of slow production,conditions at the present moment are undoubtedly worse  thanthey have been for many years.     Broadly speaking, it may be said that 25/a of the employees in the various branches of the Motor Industry are  unemployed,while a considerable proportion of the remainder are workingpart time only.     It cannot be said that there is any evidence  whatever ofimprovement within any reasonable period of time,  so far  atleast as the home market is concerned.     Although the above refers particularly to the Private CarIndustry, and applies not only to British kanufacturers,  but even, in a greater degree in comparison, to Importers,  there isconsiderable evidence that the general industrial  depressionis beginning to react seriously on many Commercial VehicleManufacturers.
3x2     As regards export - while British Manufacturers are morethan maintaining their proportion of business in certain Dominionmarkets vis-a-vis our principal competitors in the United States,large stocks of American cars exported prior to the general slumpremain unsold, and are being liquidated at heavy sacrifices.This applies largely to the products of General Llotors and the chrysler and other well known American Companies.     There is, however, evidence in Australia, New Zealand,South Africa, and to some extent in India, that losses sustained by distributors and agents of American cars are assisting towards a reaction in favour of British motor products.    Any improvementin general conditions should speedily be reflected in increased demand for British motor vehicles of all kinds,     SIR CYRIL KURCOMB sent the following notes:-     The number of motor vehicles (excluding motor cycles)  newls^registered in June 1930 was 3,562.less than in the correspondingperiod of 1929,   This decrease was made up as follows:-                                   Increase C+)  or Decrease (-)            Cars taxed on             horse-power.........          - 3,129            Goods vehicles.......          -   463            Motor hackneys.......          -    IV            Other vehicles .......          *    47                                           - 3,552     Motor Cycles newly registered in June, 1930,  shewed adecrease of 1,173.                              COTTON.     SIR KENNETH STEWART wrote:-     The state of the cotton trade in July was as depressingas it is possible to imagine.     There was hardly a redeeming feature anywhere and manufacturingconcerns have been closing down week after week.     The state of the cotton trade gives one the impression  that either consumption has ceased or the world is living uponaccumulated stocks.     There was a general lack of confidence in the price of  the raw materials during July which is a feature which alwaysdiscourages business.     ?rom the enquiries received it appears probable that  there is some business to be placed when merchants can begin to feel  thatthe bottom of the market has been touched.     India and China are quite lifeless except for a limited number of orders for Karachi and Hong Kong.     The disturbed state of both markets are responsible for this.     The Dutch East Indies and. other rubber producing markets arevery quiet owing to the low -price of their principal&apos; commodity andall other markets are much below normal.-1 o--
MR. H,W. LEE wrote:-     The report for July is one that reflects no change inthe situation;  if anything,&quot;business has been, if possible,less active than in June and this applies to every branch ofthe cotton textile trade in every market of the world notexcluding the home trade,   The outlook is exceedingly blackend until the price of the raw material has steadied, or ratheruntil it begins to move up and we get into the Autumn trade,  Ido not anticipate any improvement.   The discussion of theCotton Report continues, it is being conducted by Committeesand sub-Committees of the Trade Associations and Pederations but these will be greatly delayed by the holiday season, and I donot lock for much light on the subject, let alone any decidedaction before the Autumn.     The Executive of the &quot;Joint Committee&quot; will meet onAugust 29th and will then decide if we have come to the timewhen a meeting of the full Committee can be of use, but I am inclined to think that must be delayed for some little timeuntil it is seen what action the Trade Federations are proposing to take or of course if no action is taken.                       WOOLLEN AND WORSTED.     MR. HAMILTON sent the following report:-     The general strike in the Wool Textile Industry has nowpractically come to an end, although many of tho weavingoverlookers in the Kuddersfield district are still holding out.In spite of this fact, there is an improvement in the machineryactivity in the above-mentioned district, the figure being about80$.     In Bradiord, unemployment figures are very high, and theTrade is participating in the general depression which is hangingover the Industry in almost every country.   Numerous concerns,amongst them two very old Bradford businesses, have recently beenput into liquidation, and it is anticipated that more will followbefore the end of the year.     Amongst members of the Trade in general, there is a gooddeal of confidence in a distinct improvement in demand during theAutumn months,                       DISTRIBUTING TRADES.     SIR WOODMAN BURBTDGE sent the following report:-     Owing to the intervention of the holiday,  it has been impossible to obtain statistics from Department -  tores  as to  Tradeconditions during July,  It can be safely said, however,  thatretail trade has not been up to expectations, and although  thereare several favourable exceptions, most Stores have found itimpossible to equal last year&apos;s figures.     The July 3ales have, on the whole, not proved  so  satisfactory as had been hoped, and although, again, there are exceptions,  thegeneral experience has been that results this year fell short byabout 5:&apos;b as compared with 1929,   Subsequently, weather conditions have made trade even more difficult than it would otherwise havebeen.
     Grace mere reference has to he made to the severe fallIn prices which is now proving a factor qf increasing importance in the retail trade.   The fall in raw cotton and wool prices, and in those of other textiles,  is nowbecoming more largely reflected in the manufactured product,and this cannot fail to have its effect on retail turnover.Another indication *2f the same tendency is the substantial fallin the price of the average purchase? and although thereduction in the price of the article purchased is to someextent responsible, there is no doubt also that the public have been buying more cautiously than usual.     The conditions described above apply generally to all sections in the Store,SHXPP1NG, AND SHIPBUILDING.

PHILLIPS sent the following Report and Statement:-     There was a further increase in unemployment during July.The total number of persons on the Registers of EmploymentExchanges increased b-&quot; 120,092 from 1,890,575 at 50th June to2,011,457 at 28th July.  The numbers wholly unemployed increasedby 88,250 and the number temporarily stopped by 31,124, while those normally in casual employment who were unemployed increasedby 1,500.
     During the period the number of men on the Registerincreased by 73,504, the number of women by 29,007 and thenumber of juveniles by 10,381,  The increase in the number ofjuveniles was due .to .the incidence of the July school leavingperiod.      In the London, and South eastern Division the numbers unemployed increased steadily during the month and in the SouthWestern Division a slight decrease in the first week was followed by increases in the remainder of the month.  these increases were no doubt largely the result of the seasonalmovement in the figures which -normally occurs in July.  The net increase in these Divisions amounted to about 23,000.     In each of the other Divisions there vere net increases inthe numbers unemployed but in every case fluctuations occurred at some part of the* month.   In the North Western Division thefigures were affected by local holidays and the figure for28th July was 30,000 higher than that of 30th June.   InScotland also there was an increase of about 29,000, owinglargely to depression in the jute industry at Dundee.     The increased unemployment during the month is againlargely accounted for by the coal mining and cotton textile industries,  but a detailed analysis for the various industries is not yet available.     The total number of insured persons in employment at21st July is estimated provisionally to be about 120,000 lessthan at 23rd June-, and about 687,40(1 less than at 22nd July,1929.

COLONIAL TRADIS.     MR. 3V3RN0N sent the following report:-     Kenya and Uganda.  The value of the export trade of kenya and Uganda during the first three months of 1950 was  1,740,047;  ascompared with  1,895,414 in the corresponding period in 1929.     The value of the import trade of Kenya and Uganda during thefirst two months of 1930 was  1,392,922;  as compared with  1,597,483in the corresponding period in 1929.    The percentage of importsfrom the United Kingdom in this period in 1930 was 37$;  ascompared with 36$ in the corresponding period in 1929.     Tanganyika Territory.   The value of the export trade of tanganyika during the first four months of 1930 was  8.36?334;  ascompared with  1,034,333 in the corresponding period in 1929.     The value of the import trade of Tanganyika during the first four months of 1930 was  1,241,448;  as compared with  1,258,944 inthe corresponding period in 1929.   The percentage of imports fromthe United Kingdom during this period in 1930 was 34$;  as comparedwith 35$ in the corresponding period in 1929.     Northern Rhodesia.   The value of the minerals produced inNorthern Rhodesia in April, 1930, was  39,010, as compared with 102,344 in the previous month.     Gold Coast.  An interesting Trade Report for the year 1929has been received from the Gold Coast.     The total value of exports fromMfoe Gold Coast for the yearended 31st December. 1929, was  18,677,716, being  1,147,159, or8.3$, less than the value of the exports for 1928.     The total value of GoldtQoast exports during the last 5 years has been as follows:-                  1925       10,890,223.                  1926       12,104,800.                  1927       14,350,355.                  1928       13,324,875.                  1929       12,677,716.     The decrease in the value of the export trade was dueprincipally to the decrease in the value of the cacao exported.Compared with 1928, there was an increase of 12*991 tons in thequantity of cacao exported, but a decrease in value of  1,525,019.Compared with 1927, there was an increase in quantity of 28,158 tons,but a decrease in value of .-;2,023,073.   These figures speak for themselves when it is borne in mind that the value of the cacaoexported in 1929 was 78.26$ of the total value of the domesticexports of the Cclony.     It may be noted in this connection that the Gold Coastproduced about 44-g$ of the world&apos;s cacao in 1929.     With regard to imports, the value of all imports into theGold Coast in 1929 was :310,082,381, being  2,117,664, or 17,4$, lessthan the value of imports in 1928.     The total value of Gold Coast imports during the last 5 years has been as follows:-
                 1925    9,782,619                 1926   10,285,876                 1927   15,770*542                 1928   12,200,045                 1929   10,082,581     The decrease in the value of the import trade in 1929 ischiefly attributed to the decrease in the purchasing power of thepeople owing to the reduced value of the cacao crop,   Therestrictions imposed on the sale of spirits seem also to have had some effect on the total value of imports.     The percentage shares of the import and export trade takenby the United Kingdom, United States of America, Germany, holland and France respectively in 1913 and during the last five years were as follows:- UnitedKingdom.

The value of the Nigeria import trade in the first four monthsof 1950 was  4,456,898;  as compared with  4,985,405 in thecorresponding period in 1929.     Ceylon.   The value of the export trade of Ceylon during thefirst five months of 1950 was  11,275,286;  as compared with 15,655,826 in the corresponding period in 1929.     The value of the import  trade of Ceylon during the first five months of 1950 was  10,790,766;  as compared with  15,165,187 inthe corresponding period in 1929,SOUTH AMERICAN MARKET PROSPECTS.    MR, HOSE sent the following report:-     In Argentina, the situation in regard to the agricultural cropshas improved during the past month, there having been dry andfrosty weather which will beneficially retard the growth of thewheat, linseed and oats crops.   Haize shelling operations havealso been facilitated by the cold weather and are very active;picking is practically finished and shipments should become heavier,as the grain is getting into exportable condition.
9 0 9U  l hJ       Tl-a Argentine general commercial situation has  been  adversely affected by the continued low level  of the exchange  value of the currency.  The passing of the United States Tariff  Bill i.Q  also considered an adverse faptor, since the inoreased  duties cannot  but tend to restrict the flow of trade with the  northern Republic.  The reduced trade mov^ent In the Republic  this year is reflected in an Inorease In commercial  failures  and a reduction in Customs revenue, total liabilities involved  in commercial failures in the first six months of 1930 having  been 105,073,081 pesos (paper),  as oompared with 72*490,147  pesoB in the corresponding period of 1929* whilst receipts at  the Buenos Aires Customs House in the first half of  1930  totalled 153,062,21(3 pesos (paper), or 29,567,864 pesos less  than in the corresponding period of 1929.     &quot;  Tl&apos;e continuance of stringency in the credit situation*  in Chile,  together with a declining tendency in commodity  prides,1 has adversely affected the trade movement, and  commercial houses generally are operating with caution,       In  regard to the situation in the Chilean nitrate of soda  industry,  particular interest attaches to the  conferences which  have taken place in Paris during the past month.  The negotia-  tions have been solely between interests representing the  synthetic nitrogen producers, but,  so soon as  any international  agreement has beon reaohed, it is not unlikely to be followed  by a further agreement with the Chilean produoers, an agreement  which would have as its basis the restriction  of the output of  synthetio nitrogen and the fixing of agreed prices by the  Chilean and synthetic producers.       Generally speaking, the oommerolal and credit situation  in Brazil shows no appreciable improvement. Ti*ere would appear,  however,&apos; to have been some slight betterment in coffee market  condition&apos;.-.  The terms of the recently issued  international  Coffee Realisation Loan have commenced to take effect,  and, in  accordance therewith,  entries, of the commodity into  the Port of  Santos since 1st July have been fixed ai 895,834 bags per month,  based on an estimate of two years orops.  These crop estimates  are placed at 7,500,000 and 14,000,000 bags for the  current  year and next year, respectively,  the monthly  figure of entries  representing one twenty-fourth part of the total of  21,500,000  bags.       In  regard to the purchase of 3,000*000 bags of  coffee by  the State Government,  in aooordanoe with the terms of the loan  contract,  it is reported that one-third of this quantity will  be purchased in the Interior direct from planters.  such  purchases in the Interior will be confined to  fine grade green  coffee of the 1930 crop,and will be shipped to Santos aB  purchased.  Samples of these coffees will be available to  exporters in Santos, and the supplies will be  sold as required.  Lots  so disposed of will be Immediately replaced by Government  purchases of like quantities in the Santos spot market.       Tbe returns of Brazilian foreign trade for the  first  five months of 1930 show that the aggregate value of imports  was equivalent to  25,507,000,  and that of exports to   33,655,000, as oompared with  38,033,000 and   38,840,000,  respectively,  in January-May, 1929, while the  visible balance  of merchandise trade shows an increase of  7*340,000 to   8,143,000, .
4     In Mexico, there has as yet been no improvement in themining situation, which is having a serious effect upon business,and commerce in general continues to be extremely quiet.   business in staple import lines, such as textiles, provisions and hardware,is dull, owing to poor harvests and to unemployment created by the closing down of mines.   Nevertheless, progress is being made Incertain directions, the outlook in the agricultural and petroleumindustries in the Tampico district being somewhat improved, whilstimports of machinery and electrical equipment continue to be heavy.     The general commercial situation in Peru continues depressed,with collections slower, although commercial failures are notheavy.   Imports are fairly well maintained so far as quantityis concerned, although the values are appreciably lower than last year.     Owing to the low level of prices for cotton, business in thelocal market for the staple in Peru is quiet, whilst sugar export business has also been inactive.   The Peruvian authoritiescontinue to have difficulty in maintaining 4he stabilisation ratefor the exchange, as fixed in February last, the current ratebeing 13.06^ soles to the   sterling, as compared with the goldparity of 12,166.     According to mail advices from Bogota, there has been some slight improvement in the general demand for merchandise at thatcentre, and the transport situation is now excellent.   Generallyspeaking, the Colombian commercial situation is still affected bycredit stringency and the necessity for public economy.   Theprincipal crop of coffee in Colombia has been harvested, butbusiness in the market for the commodity is quiet.   The ColombianGovernment has again arranged for a general survey of the financial,Tariff and banking situation in the Republic to be made by theUnited States expert, Professor Kemmerer.     The General outlook for the next harvest of coffee inGuatemala is satisfactory;  it is anticipated that the crop willbe of good quality, although there may be some reduction in thetotal output.   The Guatemalan Administration has under consideration the urgent necessity of effecting economies in the national expenditure so thatbudgetary equilibrium may be established.Business in Salvador continues exceptionally quiet, althoughexportsof coffee continue in completion of contracts.   The commercialsituation is affected by credit stringency.   On the recommendationcf a firm of &quot;Jinglish chartered accountants, the National Assemblyhas approved a new Audit Law, with the object of revising theGovernment Accounting system and providing for a more effectivecheck on the national finances.     The Venezuelan Budget for the year ending June, .1931, providesfor revenue estimated at 202,598,500 Bolivares, against expenditureof 201,800,000 Bolivares.   i-rospeots for the next crop of coffeein the Republic are excellent.   The general commercial situationin Nicaragua is still depressed.
