TRIE DOCUMENT IS THE PKOPBHTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S .GOYERNMENT.                       Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1930.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.   39CP.  268 (30).[W 6956/103/50]CABINET.CEREMONIES IN  CONNECTION  WITH  FOREIGN WAR MEMORIALS.       MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR  FOREIGN AFFAIRS.    ON  the 17th December,  1929 (see Cabinet  Conclusions 53 (29)),  the cabinet had before them a memorandum in which it was suggested that the time had now come for discontinuing the practice of placing wreaths on foreign war memorialsand official participation in all such ceremonies abroad.  The Cabinet decided thatthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, without at that stage formally proposing the discontinuance of the above practices, should take such steps as he might deemappropriate to sound foreign nations on the subject with a view  to discontinuanceif the replies were favourable.    In accordance with this decision, I instructed His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at paris, Rome, Brussels, Lisbon, Warsaw, Prague, Bucharest, Belgrade, Athens, Tokyoand Washington to sound unofficially the Governments to which they are accredited,and ascertain whether they would favour the discontinuance of the exchange of this form of international courtesy.    I have now received the  observations of all the  Governments addressed, andthere is a general consensus of opinion that it would be desirable to dispense with theceremonies in question.  I  need only quote one of these replies, namely, that  from paris.    The French Ministry for Foreign  Affairs informed the British Embassythat they entirely agree with these proposals.  In fact, the French authorities, bothcivil, military and naval, have suffered much from the abuse of the practice of placingwreaths  on war memorials.   Whenever  ceremonies of this kind are carried out inFrance it is necessary for one or more officers to be present, and a  considerable amountof their  time is thus occupied. The French Government would therefore be glad to see the practice discontinued.    In these circumstances  I suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in thecountries of  all the  former Allied  and  Associated Powers should be instructed to address the Governments to which they are accredited officially proposing that thepractice be discontinued. Next Armistice Day might be suggested as the date for thebeginning  of the new arrangement.  I suggest also that, out of courtesy, ex-enemy countries should be  informed at  the same  time   I  attach hereto the draft of a despatch which might be sent to  His Majesty&apos;s Representatives on the subject.  Acopy might be sent to His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in  ex-enemy countries,  with instructions to inform those Governments of the proposals.                                                                      A.  H.    July 22,  1930.Draft Despatch to His Majesty&apos;s  Representatives in the Countries of Former Allied                             and A ssociated Powers.Sir,     It has been represented to His Majesty&apos;s Government that  the time has now come when probably in all the countries involved in the Great  War general feelingwould be in favour of discontinuing the practice of placing wreaths on foreign warmemorials and official participation in all such ceremonies abroad.       5494   [21428J
    2.  For the purpose of ascertaining whether this impression was correct I madeunofficial enquiries at certain capitals during the early part of this year, and I havenow ascertained that in as many as eleven countries the Governments  would be content to see these practices abandoned.    3.  I accordingly request that you will inform the Government to which you are accredited that His Majesty&apos;s Government understand that there is now a general,consensus of opinion that the time has come to discontinue the exchange  of this formof international courtesy, and His Majesty&apos;s Government, for their part, accordinglypropose to discontinue  the practice.  If, as His  Majesty&apos;s Government hope,  theGovernment to which you are accredited share their views, they would suggest that a convenient date  for  bringing  the  new arrangement  into  force  would be  the11th November  next.    4.  This despatch has been addressed to His  Majesty&apos;s Representatives in thecountries of all the former Allied and Associated Powers.
