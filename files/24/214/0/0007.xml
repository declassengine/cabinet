THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1930.SECRET.                                                   Copy&quot; No.  38O.P. 257 (30).CABINET.TREATY  WITH  :IRAQ.        MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR THE  COLONIES.    AT their Meeting on the 2nd July I informed the  Cabinet that the new treaty with &apos;Iraq had been signed at Baghdad on the 30th June.  I now circulate,  for theinformation of my colleagues, a copy of a despatch from Sir Francis Humphrysenclosing the text of the Treaty and of the formal Notes exchanged at the time of signature  (Appendix A).   I circulate also (Appendix  B)  copies  of two lettersaddressed to Sir Francis Humphrys by the Traqi Prime Minister dealing with     (a)  the special Traqi  force to be constituted for the protection of the  British          air bases in Traq, and    (b)  the international obligations which will devolve upon the Traq Government          when Traq enters the League of Nations.    It is not proposed to publish either of these letters,  at any rate at the present stage.    As  my  colleagues will see from paragraph 2 of  Sir Francis Humphrys&apos;despatch,  there were certain points upon which  the Traqi negotiators asked thatthey should  be furnished  with  further assurances by His Majesty&apos;s Government.This  question was  taken up  immediately upon the arrival  in  this country ofSir Francis Humphrys and Nuri Pasha,  the Traq  Prime Minister,  and, afterconsultation and in agreement  with the  departments  concerned and the Air  andGeneral Staff, I authorised  Sir Francis Humphrys to address  the letter  to NuriPasha, of which a copy will be  found in Appendix C.   This letter  also will not bepublished.    Negotiations are now  proceeding with the Traq Prime Minister with a view tothe settlement of financial  questions outstanding between the two countries.   I shallnot fail to keep the Cabinet informed of any important developments.                                                                         P.    Colonial Office, July 18,  1930.[21412]B
APPENDIX (A). (Confidential.) My Lord,                               The Residency, Baghdad, July 1, 1930.     I HAVE the honour  to  invite reference to my telegram No. 313 dated the 30th June, 1930, and to transmit herewith, under separate cover, the original signed copies, in English and Arabic, of the Treaty and connected documents.  Signature took place on the 30th June at the Residency, in the presence of His Majesty the Regent, the draft Judicial Agreement having previously been initialled.  The Prime Minister  left  Baghdad for Europe  on the following day,  after obtaining  His Majesty&apos;s assent to the immediate dissolution of Parliament with the object of laying the Treaty before the people.     2.   There are three points upon which the Traqi negotiators have asked me to endeavour to obtain assurances from His Majesty&apos;s Government before the Treaty is ratified, and upon which I hope to  have an opportunity of expressing my views to Your Lordship personally on my arrival in London.  The first is the objection felt by His Majesty&apos;s Government  to specifying  that the forces  to be retained in &apos;Iraq by His Majesty&apos;s Government under Article 5 of the Treaty shall be defined as  &quot; air forces,&quot; and that the essential communications  of His Britannic Majesty referred to in the same  article shall be defined as &quot; air communications.&quot; The second is the reference  in clause 7 of the appendix  to &quot;transit  through  Traq&quot; without  any definition of the direction  or  route to be followed.   The third is covered by the separate letter addressed to  me by  the  Prime  Minister on  the  subject of the international obligations referred to in Article 8.   I mention these points now as I have no  doubt that the Prime Minister will take the first possible opportunity after his arrival in London of raising them with  His Majesty&apos;s Government, and I am anxious  that nothing should be said to  him before I have had an opportunity of explaining the position.     3.   I  have explained to His Majesty King Faisal and the Prime Minister the general lines upon which His Majesty&apos;s  Government anticipate that the Committee of  the Assembly of  the League of Nations will require assurances from  the Traq Government before rendering  their  report on the  question  whether Traq satisfies the conditions prescribed in paragraph 2 of Article  1 of the Covenant of the League. The position is fully appreciated by  them, and I anticipate no difficulty in ensuring that the  requisite assurances are given.     4.   The measure of independence granted to Traq under  the new Treaty will no doubt be viewed with uneasiness by  the Kurds and the Christian minorities in this country,  while the extremists who profess to  regard  the continued maintenance of British Air Forces in Traq as incompatible with sovereign rights will complain that their country remains in bondage to the foreigner.   Again,  the more unsophisticated tribesmen,  especially the Shias, who  have learnt to  value the supervision of British officers in the administration, will in their hearts deplore the  loosening of British control which is foreshadowed.   But  I trust that those Traqis who are concerned for the honour and progress of their country and are able to  take a long view will besincerely grateful for the security which the Alliance provides, and for the respon- sibility for the management of their own affairs which  seems  at last to be within their grasp.    I wish to emphasise as strongly as I am able that the success or failure of thenew order of things after Traq  has been admitted to the League will largely dependon the moral influence which the Royal Air Force will continue  to exert, on a peoplenaturally lawless and averse to the payment of taxes.   The complete withdrawal ofthe Roj^al Air Force to Shaiba  and their refusal to take any hand whatever in themaintenance of law and order  would, in my opinion,  inevitably plunge the countryinto chaos  before many years had passed.    5.   I have been much impressed  throughout  by  the extreme friendliness andsincerity of the  Traqi delegation.   The conversations have  been more like familydiscussions than official negotiations.   This is no doubt to  some extent due to the factthat with the exception of myself the negotiators on both  sides have been personal friends for many years, and also that it was unnecessary to employ an official inter-preter, as Major Young interpreted throughout.  But  it is  also, to my mind, a clear indication  that the policy  of His Majesty&apos;s  Government in  Traq lias  been wisely
conceived and, above all, sympathetically carried out.  To my predecessors in office no less than to the staff of British officials who have been upholding British traditionsin &apos;Iraq for the past ten years is due the frank and friendly atmosphere in whichthese negotiations could alone have been brought to a successful conclusion.                                               I have, &amp;c.                                     (Signed)    F. H.

APPENDIX  (B).                                       Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Baghdad,Sir,                                                June 30, 1930.    WITH regard to the second paragraph of Article 8 of the Treaty, I have the honour to request that the Traq Government may be furnished in  due course with acomplete list of the international instruments therein referred to in order that theymay be acquainted with the texts of these instruments before the Treaty is presented.by them to Parliament for ratification.                                                        I have,  &amp;c.                                               (Signed)      NOITRY SAID.His Excellency Sir E.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Baghdad,Sir,                                                June 30, 1930.    I have the honour to inform you, with reference to Clause 4 of the Annexureto the Treaty which we have signed to-day,  that when the time comes to bring that clause into effect the Traq  Government will be prepared to agree to the following arrangements  for the special guards referred to therein.  I do not anticipate thatany legislation will be necessary in order  to ensure the smooth working of  thisarrangement, but if there is any point upon which it is found in practice that theexisting law is insufficient for this purpose, the necessary legslation will be passedwithout delay:     (a)  The force will consist of not more than  1,250 men, exclusive of british personnel.    (b)  Service in the force will be voluntary, and such service will exempt  anymember of the force from the provisions of any law for compulsory service.    (c)  The force will be under  the command of a British Commanding Officer  andthe requisite number of subordinate British and Traqi officers,  all  of whom will hold the commission of His Majesty the King of  Traq.  It will also include such Britishwarrant  and non-commissioned  officers as  may be necessary, who shall have thepowers normally pertaining  to their ranks.  The Commanding Officer will have thepower to make rules regarding recruitment, administration, nature  of arms, equip-ment and clothing,  method of training,  rates of pay and conditions of service.    (d)  With  regard to discipline, the force, with  the exception of  the british personnel, will be subject to  Traq Military Law7.  The Commanding Officer and the subordinate British officers will be granted the necessary summary powers,  and the commanding Officer will have full discretion as to the convening and composition of courts-martial.  The sentences of courts-martial of which the Commanding officer is not a member will be confirmed by him.  In cases in which the Commanding officer is himself  a member  of  the court or  in which the sentence imposed by the courtexceeds  one year&apos;s imprisonment, confirmation of the sentence will  be made by theMinister of Defence.    (e)  The primary  duty of the force will be the protection of such air bases inTraq as may with the consent of the Traq Government be occupied by the forcesof His Britannic Majesty, and this duty will include the task of safeguarding thematerial and stores of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s forces in  Traq wherever they.may be.For the purpose of carrying out these duties, the sole  executive  responsibility forwhich will rest with the  Commanding Officer,  the force  will be placed at the entiredisposal of the Air Officer Commanding.    (/)  It  is understood that from time to time it may be necessary,  in order thatthe above duties may be properly  performed, that members of the force should receiveorders from officers of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s forces.  Such orders will normally be conveyed to the force through its own officers, but the  Traq  Government raise noobjection in cases of necessity to such orders being given direct, and will take stepsto ensure that in this case all  members of the force shall be under an obligation toobey such orders, and that  they shall enjoy the same immunities as if the orders
had been given by an officer of the forces of His Majesty the King of Traq.  It isunderstood that any power  of command over Traqi forces which may be  given toofficers of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s forces will only be exercised in relation to thespecial forces.    (g)  The entire cost of the force will be  met by His Majesty&apos;s Government inGreat Britain.  . .

I AM instructed to inform Your Excellency that the forces which His BritannicMajesty is authorised to maintain in Traq in accordance with the terms of Article 5of the Treaty shall comprise Royal Air Force units, together with ancillary services.    I am also instructed to inform Your Excellency that, whereas it is provided in clause 4 of the Annexure of the Treaty that the protection of the  air bases to be occupied by the forces of His Britannic  Majesty in Traq shall be  undertaken  by special guards from the forces of His Majesty the King of  Traq, yet it is under-stood that His Britannic Majesty  is authorised  in time  of  emergency in case  thespecial  guards  should,  after  consultation  between  the two  High  ContractingParties, be considered inadequate for the defence  of  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  air bases in Traq, to reinforce such guards temporarily by his own land forces.    I am also instructed to inform Your Excellency that the expression &quot; in transitacross Traq,&quot; used in Clause 7 of the Annexure of the Treaty,  means transit fromany place west of the Euphrates to the Persian Gulf, or  in  the opposite direction.

The  High Contracting Parties recognise that,  upon  the entry into force of this Treaty, all responsibilities  devolving  under the Treaties  and Agreements referred to in Article 7 hereof upon Plis Britannic Majesty in respect of Traq will,  in so far as Plis Britan- nic Majesty is concerned, then automatically and completely come to an end, and that  such responsiblities, in so far as they continue nt all, will devolve upon His Majesty the King of Traq alone.   It is also recognised  that all responsibilities devolving upon His Britannic Majesty in respect of Traq under any other international instrument, in  so far as they continue at all, should similarly de- volve  upon  His Majesty the King  of  Traq  alone, and the High Contracting Parties  shall immediately take such steps as may be necessary to secure  the transference to His  Majesty the King of Traq of these responsibilities.

Article 10.

Article  11.   This Treaty shall be ratified and ratifications shall be exchanged as soon as possible.  Thereafter it shall come into force as soon as Traq has been admitted to membership of the League of Nations.   The present Treaty shall remain in force  for a period of twenty- five years from the date  of its coming into force.  At any time after twenty  years from the date of the coming into force of this Treaty,the High  Contracting Parties will, at the request of either of them,conclude a new Treaty which shall provide for the continued main-tenance and protection  in all  circumstances of the  essential com-munieations  of Plis Britannic Majesty.

in this  matter the difference will be submitted  to  the  Council  ofthe League of Nations.
