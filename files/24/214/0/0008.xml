a document is the property of  His  Britannic Ma jest^JjB Government.     My colleagues will remember that in July, 1929,  I consultedthem about an application made by M. Leon Trotsky for permission to visit this country, and that the Cabinet decided (cabinet conclusions 28(89), Colclusion 5) to refuse M. Trotsky&apos;application.  That decision and the reasons for it were coramuni-cated by me to the House of Commons in a lengthy reply to questions on the 18th July, 1929f and again during the Debate on the ad-journment on the 24th July, 1929.     M. Trotsky has not renewed his application but,  on the 3rdJuly last, I was asked by Miss Wilkinson whether 1 was preparedto reconsider my refusal to grant to  M. Trotsky a visa to visitthis country for medical and personal reasons, and I  replied thatI was not prepared to reconsider the decision.     Miss Wilkinson has now approached me again in a  recent letterwritten apparently after consultation with certain Members of theHouse of Commons, in which she urges that M, Trotsky  should beallowed to come here for medical reasons and represents that hisadmission now would not cause so much difficulty as it would havedone in 1929.     No evidence has been produced to show that M. Trotsky is in need of medical attention or that, if he is, he can obtain it only in this country.  It is reported, however, that  since our refusal to allow M. Trotsky to come here, both the Dutch and theSpanish Governments have indicated their unwillingness to admithim to their territory.     I am not aware of any considerations which seem  to make itdesirable to reopen the question of M. Trotsky&apos;s admission, butas the previous decision to refuse him facilities for his proposed visit was taken by the Government as a whole, I have  thought it58(30).CABINET.LEON  TROTSKY.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.
right to submit to my colleagues the representations that havebeen made to me with a view to ascertaining whether there is anydesire that our previous decision should be changed.                                             Jo  R.  C .18th July, 1930.
