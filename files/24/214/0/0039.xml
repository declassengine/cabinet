IMPERIAL  CONFERENCE,  1930.         INTERDEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE  ON  ECONOMIC QUESTIONS.I                            -           Memorandum for the Information of  United Kingdom Ministers.                 BULK  PURCHASE  OF DOMINION  PRODUCE.        Note. The Treasury desire it to be mentioned that they could not be a party    to the  submission of any positive proposals on this subject without instructions    from the Chancellor of the Exchequer.        1.  His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia has proposed    for  discussion at  the Imperial Conference the question of giving  assistance to    Dominion  producers by means of bulk purchase.  Until more  precise information    is available as to what is intended by this suggestion, it is impossible to examine    the proposal in any detail.   A prefiminary examination of the subject,  however,    shows that each commodity which might be considered as suitable for bulk purchase    presents special problems of its own.        2.  The discussion at the Imperial Conference may cover  a wide field and it    may be useful to set out some of the considerations which it appears to be necessary    to bear in mind  in  considering  the general  question of the bulk purchase by    Great Britain of Dominion produce.        3.  It  is improbable that any private corporation without statutory authority    could carry out a scheme of the kind contemplated in the case of any of the staple    products such as wheat, meat or wool.   It is, therefore, assumed that the intention    is that the purchaser in this country shall be the Government itself or some authority    set up by  Parliament with special statutory powers.                           Considerations affecting Wheat.        4.  The character and importance of the undertaking, as well as the extent of    the financial  risks involved, would be greatly affected  by the selection of the    commodity for bulk purchase. For example, in 1927  the total imports of wheat    into the United Kingdom were   68 millions,  of which  32 millions  came  from    Empire countries.   The financial risks involved in the bulk purchase of all Dominion    wheat required by the United Kingdom would be very considerable.  On the other    hand, the  requirements of this country in respect of wheat can be estimated with    close precision and the risks of over-buying or  of unsaleable stocks are negHgible.    In the  case of a necessary of life  such as wheat, however, it seems certain that, ifI   the Government were to assume responsibility for the importation of all, or practi-    cally all, Dominion produce coming to this country, private traders could not be    relied upon to provide the  balance of our requirements not covered by home and    Dominion  produce, and it is  difficult to see how private traders could exist or be    permitted  to exist side by side with the Government enterprise. The Government    would,  therefore, in practice, be obliged to act as the sole wheat importer.   Our    international  obligations require that, if a monopoly is established in regard to the    importation of any commodity, the monopoly shall be extended to home produce,    and, in any case, this would probably be essential in the interests  of the home    producer.   It would, therefore, appear that  there  is  not likely to be found any    workable  proposition short  of a  complete State monopoly : in other  words, a    decision to &quot; bulk-purchase &quot; Dominion wheat would inevitably lead to the State    contracting for  all wheat imports as well as purchasing all home produce which    leaves the  farm.(C 1230) 40 8/30
    5. Difficulty might arise respecting other commodities if  wheat became aState monopoly.  For example, wheat flour would almost certainly have to come under the same control.  The Dominions would probably wish to increase their exports to this country of wheat flour.  On the other hand, Great Britain might consider that its interests were  better served by importing wheat  rather thanwheat flour.   The argument has also been advanced that the  control of wheatimports would inevitably  have to be extended to other grains.    6. Ministers are familiar with the arguments in favour of and against  theestablishment of a Wheat Import and  Home Purchasing Board, and it is  not necessary to  restate them here.  What is important, however, is to observe that asole monopoly by the  State to  import wheat  has been  advocated for  entirely different reasons.  It has been advanced,  from the point of view of the UnitedKingdom, as the best method of (i) protecting the consumer in this country fromthe operations of organised producers overseas ; and (ii) securing to wheat growersin Great Britain a better price resulting from economies in the purchase and handling of overseas supplies.  Neither of these  conditions  could  be satisfied unless  the purchasing  Board were free to  buy  imported produce  to  the best advantage,i.e., without preferential  treatment of any of the competing sources of supply.It is, in fact, difficult to see how either of these objects could be combined with the granting of advantages for the Dominion producer, but the same  machinery isnow, apparently, in effect, to be suggested by Australia, with a view to benefitingDominion growers.   Of our total  wheat supplies in the last five years, 19 per cent.has been home  produced, 42 per cent, has come from other parts of the  Empire,and 39 per cent, from outside the Empire.  No evidence seems to  be availablein support of the view that  centralised purchase would effect such economies as would enable a higher price to be paid to the home and Dominion producers thanthe market parity would justify, without  requiring the consumer or taxpayer tocontribute.     7. A proposal that the  Government in the  United Kingdom should &quot;bulk-purchase &quot; Dominion wheat  would need to be considered from  the point of viewof the home country&apos;s general relationship with the various&apos; parts of the BritishEmpire, as well as with foreign countries.  It is obvious that the Home Governmentcould not  undertake to buy all exportable wheat produced in  the Dominions.Some method would, therefore, have to be devised for allocating purchases amongthe various  Dominions,  and any method  adopted would have to be capable ofmodification from time to time in accordance With the quantity available  in thedifferent Dominions for export to this country.  Any scheme of this kind  would almost certainly give rise to  a demand from other parts of the British Empire for similar treatment.  For example, it would be scarcely practicable for the homecountry to enter into an arrangement of direct benefit to wheat growers in canada and Australia and refuse to consider a similar scheme for the benefit of sugar pro-ducers in the West Indies.  If, in practice, the bulk purchase of Dominion wheatproved advantageous to farmers in the Dominions, it is  practically certain that,in a  very little  while, the whole of the  overseas supplies coming to this country would be obtained from Dominion sources. The effect of any such scheme on our international trade (e.g., with the Argentine a large buyer of our manufacturedexports) would, therefore, need very careful consideration.     8.  It may be urged that what the Dominion grower requires is not a preferentialprice, but security an assured  market in Great Britain for his produce.  As ageneral aim, this proposition will meet  with  a sympathetic reception,  but, untilthe detailed proposals  have been presented,  it is impossible to examine it.   Atpresent, no  details  are known.   Under any scheme, however, there  would  be difficulties in fixing the prices at which Dominion produce would  be  purchasedand also the price at which it would  be sold.  The principle to  be followed wouldbe either to  adopt the normal business method (i.e., to buy at the cheapest pricepossible (Market Price),  which  would not afford much scope for assisting theDominions)  or to buy at some arbitrary price level, which might turn out to beabove or below world prices.  If it proved to be above world prices, the extra  cost would have to be recouped either from the home  consumer or taxpayer ; if, on theother hand,  it  proved to be below world prices the Dominions  producer wouldhave a grievance.ill Mi mil miiii ii&apos; biinwmiliBiiiirfliinTiimmim n mmniirffnw11bm ifi i iimbtih11rwmi wi irnniiwnawi iiTfrffftiinnti niwiiMii hi i*i hiimrriffcaniin rimimpjiimhbin aiirrn n111nmila miwimimi m* w^ ai.....Mnn*iiiiiiiiiiiii*wiiiaiiniMiiniii((iiiiiwiiimwMiMw......hwiimt
                              Meat and Wool.    9. Home  production  accounts,  at  trie  present  time,  for  approximately40 per cent, of Great BritahYs total supplies of meat.  The remainder is made up of17 per cent, from British countries  overseas and 43 per cent,  foreign.  For thepurposes of this discussion, however,  it will be  desirable to consider each classof meat separately.    10.  In the case of beef,  43 per cent, is home produced, 13 per cent,  comes from the Dominions and 44 per cent, from foreign countries, chiefly the Argentine.By far the largest and an increasing proportion  of the imported supplies are chilled,and the Dominions are not in a position to supply chilled beef which the consumerin this country wants.  The Dominions supply about 45 per cent, of frozen beef,which already has an effective price. preference from H.M. Forces.    11.  In the case of mutton and lamb, the proportions are : home produced,44 per cent., Dominions, 34 per cent., and  foreign countries, 22 per cent.   NewZealand sends the great bulk of Dominion supplies and its marketing organisation is very  powerful.   Australian supplies fluctuate enormously, owing  to droughtand wool prices.    12.  In the case of pig meat, home production accounts for 32 per cent., foreignsupplies for 54 per cent., and  Dominions, 14 per cent., the greater part of which comes from the Irish Free State.    13.  In view of the facts briefly summarised in the three preceding  paragraphs,it is not easy to see in what manner the Home Government could assist Dominionsby the bulk purchase of meat supplies.   In any case, in meat as in wheat, theGovernment could not run the risk  of causing  supplies to become short of normal requirements by  creating a feeling of uncertainty among importers consequent on the Government itself entering the  meat trade.    14. Wool is an important  product of some  Dominions.  Of the imports of woolinto Great Britain during the last five, years, 83 per cent., valued  at  54 millions per annum on the average, has come from Empire countries.  Wool is in a differentposition from wheat and meat, and  there  are additional reasons why the bulk purchase of Dominion wool would prove difficult.  Exports and re-exports account for about one-half of the imports. England is a world market for wool, which doesnot necessarily arrive here for consumption in this country.  It is an industrialproduct and there are numerous varieties.  In  making bulk purchases it would be essential to anticipate the requirements not only of domestic, but also of foreignbuyers.                          Other Dominion Products.    15. It may be thought that it might be worth while to test in actual practice the results which would follow from an undertaking  by ^the Home Governmentto &quot; bulk purchase,&quot;  for a specified period of years, some Dominion product  of less importance to Great  Britain  than any  of the staple commodities  above-mentioned.  The difficultjr would be, however, to decide upon a product or products which enabled the scheme to be carried through without giving rise to a feeling thatone Dominion had been specially favoured and  others unfairly treated.  Even inthe case of wheat, New Zealand and South Africa would not have a proper share ofthe advantages.   Similarly, South  Africa and Canada would have little. interestin the bulk purchase of meat.  These difficulties could possibly be overcome bythe selection of two or three different commodities, the bulk  purchase of whichwould, in the aggregate, confer approximately an equal measure of benefit on thedifferent Dominions.  It would be necessary, however, to consider possible reactionson the  Colonies (cf., West Indies and sugar,  paragraph 7 above), and no doubthome growers would also press their claims to  similar advantages.     16. Before adopting any scheme for the bulk purchase of two or three Dominionproducts not of first-class importance to the United Kingdom, a careful study wouldbe desirable so as to  ascertain what precise problems would be likely to  arise in
the administration of such a scheme.  For example, if it were decided to purchaseDominion dried fruit, the question would immediately arise as to whether or not it was essential that  a State monopoly should be established for dried fruit.  Onthe one hand, there would be the objection that, in order to handle Dominion driedfruit, which, at the present time, constitutes only 14* per cent, of our total imports,it would appear somewhat drastic to control all imports, including those from theUnited States, which represent 26 per cent, of the total.   On the other hand, therewould be the  risk that, in the absence of a State monopoly,  the  Governmentimporting Dominion produce might find itself undercut on the market by privatetraders obtaining supplies from other sources.   In this connection, it should also beborne in mind that an arrangement of the kind contemplated between the HomeGovernment and the Dominions could not readily be brought to an end, if it wereproving advantageous to the Dominions, without a risk of the Home government being regarded as guilty of a breach of faith.     17. There is also the question  whether the advantages to be secured by theDominions from a bulk-purchase scheme for, say, dried fruit, could not be obtainedequally well and with much less risk both of financial loss and of political compli-cations, by an expansion of the work of the  Empire Marketing  Board.  In anycase, the lessons to be learned from a scheme on the lines of that discussed in thepreceding paragraph would be limited, for the problems which would arise  inconnection with the  bulk purchase and re-sale of such  a commodity as has been mentioned, would be very  different from those which would arise in the case  ofwheat and meat.                             Alternative Proposals.     18. It is worthy of consideration whether the advantages which the Dominionsmight hope to secure by a bulk-purchase scheme could not be  obtained by some alternative means.   In  the case of commodities for which the demand is  elasticand where, unlike wheat or wool, sale is made direct to the consumer, or in caseswhere Dominion supplies are a direct and equivalent alternative to foreign supplies,propaganda and advertising, such as carried out by the Empire Marketing Board,might be expected to increase sales of Dominion produce in Great Britain.   Guaran-teed  prices could scarcely be provided for  Dominion producers b3r the  HomeGovernmentf, but, if found administratively workable, it would no doubt be helpful to the Dominions for a  quota of Dominion wheat  to be  prescribed by  statute inthe flour used for bread-making in  this country.     19. Only a preferential  method is  likely to achieve the  object apparentlydesired by Australia, and this pre-supposes either import duties levied on supplies offood coming to Great Britain from foreign countries, or an Import Board  or Boardsempowered to pay a preferential  price for Dominion and home-grown produce.Both of these  methods  would presumably throw additional burdens on the con-sumers or taxpayers in  this country.  How far it  would be politic for  the homecountry to undertake additional burdens which, in one  form or another, mightbe reflected in the price, at which the United Kingdom could sell its manufactured products  in countries outside the  Empire, is a  matter on which there is  acutecontroversy and need not be examined here.    * Of the Dominion dried fruit received in the United Kingdom in 1926-27-28, Australia supplied81 -4 per cent., South Africa. 10-1 per cent., and Canada 0-5 per cent.    f The Food and Materials Committee of the Imperial Economic  Conference, held in  1923,reported:  &quot; The Committee, consider that any scheme of direct subsidy by the Home Governmentto producers in the Dominions is impracticable. If a subsidy is to be given by a Government to a classof producers, it is inevitable that the subsidising Government should retain the right to exercise alarge measure of supervision and direction over the recipients of the subsidy. This is, in fact, a con-dition upon which any Parliament would require to be satisfied before assenting to a subsidy.  Butit would obviously be not only  highly inconvenient, but practically impossible for one Governmentto attempt to exercise this power within the jurisdiction of another Government.&quot;

MEMORANDUM  FOR THE CONSIDERATION OP  THE  IMPERIAL                 CONFERENCE POLICY  COMMITTEE.Bulk Purchase of Dominion Produce,  Price Stabilization and Import Boards.                               CHAPTER  I.                              INTRODUCTORY.    1. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia, in a telegram dated 7th May, 1930, stated that it was then considering the desirability of asking that two additional subjects should be placed on the Agenda Paper for the ImperialConference, namely,  bulk purchase  in Great Britain  of Dominion products,  and price stabilisation.  A further telegram was received on the 16th July, stating thatthe Australian Government desired to confirm its request for the Imperial conference to consider the bulk purchase of Dominion products and price stabilization,  and added &quot; we are taking action for formulating specific proposals in respect of eachsubject.&quot;    2. The memorandum E.E. (B) (30) 18 on  the  bulk purchase of Dominionproduce, prepared by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Economic Questions,pointed out that a decision  to purchase in bulk from the Dominions any stapleproduct such  as wheat or meat, would inevitably lead to the State contracting forall imports of that comrnodity as well as purchasing all home produce which leavesthe farm.  The memorandum did not, however,  attempt to examine the case forImport Boards.    3. In accordance with the decision  of the Cabinet Committee  which is con-sidering Imperial Conference Policy, the present  memorandum has been preparedby  a  Committee consisting  of representatives of the  Government  Departmentsconcerned, with the object of setting out in one  comprehensive document, so faras practicable, the various  arguments which have been, or may be, advanced forand against import boards, bulk purchase and price stabilization, and to examine these  various  arguments as impartially as possible.*.                              Bulk Purchase.    5. From  the  terms of the telegrams received  from the Prime Minister ofAustralia, it appears that the present intention of the  Australian Government isto urge at the  Imperial Conference that  the  Home Government should considerfavourably proposals for the purchase in bulk of certain, specified Dominion products and, by this means, give the Dominion producers the benefit of more stable prices.    6. It is obvious that the financial and other risks involved must vary accordingto the commodity selected for bulk purchase.  If, for example, the scheme is to beapplied  to wheat or meat, it seems  certain that no Home Government could run the risk of a shortage occurring in regard to either of these essential foodstuffs byreason of private traders failing to import the balance of the nation&apos;s requirements.   * It should be recalled that a similar question was raised by the Australian Government at theImperial Economic Conference of 1923, and was referred to a Special Committee which reported against it [see Cmd. 2009, pages 243-8).40(C 1229) 40 8/30
Consequently, the Government, if it decided to bulk purchase Dominion wheat ormeat, wotild almost certainly be obliged to undertake the responsibility for thepurchase of all imports of these commodities.   Existing international obligations*require  that if a  monopoly  is established in regard to the importation of any commodity, the monopoly shall be extended to home production, and the Govern-ment would, therefore, be obliged to purchase all home produce in so far as it leavesthe farm.   In any case,  this development would probably be essential in theinterests of home producers.    7. Bulk purchase of Dominion products would, therefore, in the case of eitherwheat or meat, inevitably mean the establishment of a State monopoly extending to all imports as well as home produce.   The same probably applies to commoditiesof less importance than wheat or  meat.   For example,  if it were thought desirableto consider in detail the bulk purchase of canned or dried fruits from the Dominions,it is clear that the Government  would either have to be  prepared to  enter intocompetition with  private traders free  to import similar commodities from  otherparts of the world, or establish a State monopoly.  If, in order to avoid the necessityof establishing a monopoly in respect of an article not of first-class importance, theprivate  importer were permitted to carry on his  business side  by side with theGovernment, it is difficult to see how any advantage could be given to the Dominionproducer without the Government running the risk of a loss in its trading operations,which presumably would ultimately have to  fall on  the home taxpayer.   the probability is, therefore, that in articles of minor importance, equally with staple commodities, the Government, if it decided to bulk purchase from the Dominions,would, in practice, find it essential to establish a State  monopoly.                             Price Stabilization.    8. In the previous paragraph it is submitted that the bulk purchase of anyDominion product, whether large or small, would inevitably lead to the establish-ment of an Import Board dealing with the whole of the supplies required by thiscountry.  In the same way, the only effective means of securing price  stabilizationby Government activity is by the establishment of an Import Board.  Mr.  E. F.Wise, M.P., in his address to the Farmers&apos; Club on &quot; The  Stabilization of WheatPrices,&quot;  February, 1930, stated that  &quot; stabilization  of  prices  depends on  thecentralized purchase and import of foreign wheat.&quot;   No method of price stabiliza-tion over a wide field, so far as is known, has been put forward other than by meansof centralized  purchase.  It is impossible to contemplate that any private corpor-ation without  statutory authority could undertake the  purchase  of all the importsof any food product required in this country.   Consequently, centralized purchase,without which price stabilization cannot be secured, can only be undertaken throughthe medium of an Import Board.    9.  It may be convenient here to summarise the preceding paragraphs of thismemorandum  in  one sentence.   The bulk purchase of  Dominion, products and price stabilization, which are the two subjects which the Australian government proposes for discussion at  the  Imperial Conference,  could not be  carried  outefficiently by the Home Government except by the establishment of an Import Board.It is, therefore, proposed, in the remaining part of this  memorandum, to set out indetail the arguments advanced for and against Import Boards, it being understoodthat the machinery of an Import  Board could be readily utilised to give dominion and home producers the advantages of both price stabilization and bulk purchase.                   Import  Boards as  a Method  of Trading.    10.  In considering these arguments it is important to have clearly in  mind that Import Boards may be advocated (1) merely as a more efficient and economicalmethod of trading, or (2) as an instrument to cany out a particular trade policy.The following are, accordingly, the main lines on which any discussion of the question must pi-oceed.    11. An Import Board may be (1) a non-political body set up with the idea thata single large purchaser will (a) have greater bargaining power, and will also (b) be* See Appendix IV.
able to make large contracts ahead, thus stabilizing prices.  In so far as the result was to cheapen our overseas supplies the consumer would benefit.  In so far as theprice was stabilized the farmer both here and overseas would at any rate be able tosee further ahead.  And (c) even if contracts were not made for long periods theprice paid for home produce would no doubt not be so sensitive to the influence ofcasual cheap importations.     12. It has  also  been claimed (d)  that  large-scale buying would- produceeconomies, the benefit  of which could  be shared  by consumers and producersalike.  But though there may be cases in which a home product is wastefully andinefficiently marketed, it seems likely that the  overseas  trade is generally wellorganized, and that there is no room for  large  savings here.     13. But an Import Board may  (2) be used as the instrument of a trade policy.It may be a body controlled by the Government with a view to giving a preference to a particular interest.   It may  (a) buy Empire produce at a price above the world price, either in return for specific  trade benefits  (a matter evidently of great delicacyand difficulty), or merely in order to encourage closer relations.  In such a case thehome producer would reasonably claim equivalent terms.   Or it may (b) give thehome producer a preferential price, whether the Empire producer is paid the market price or something in excess of it.     14. Import Boards have been advocated as the instrument of any or all of these policies (which, it may be observed, are not altogether compatible with one another),and it is important that any decision  to set them up should be taken with  a clearidea of the purpose for which they are to be used.     15. In the agricultural policy laid down in &quot; Labour and the Nation,&quot;  funda-mental  importance is attached  to  the Government introducing &quot; stability intoprices of meat and grain by the collective purchase of imported foodstuffs.&quot;  Itis pointed out that the home producer is  &quot;at the mercy of unpredictable risks and.   .   .  .   is distracted from his proper task of organizing production by thenecessity of attempting  to  follow  the course of constantly changing markets.&quot;With a  view to bringing price fluctuations under control in the interests alike of producers and consumers, the policy considered it desirable to vest the responsibilityfor imports in the hands of an Import Board charged with the duty of organizing,in the most efficient and economical manner, the business of purchasing, distributingand transporting all the imports of, presumably, wheat and meat required  by thenation.   &quot; Since it would operate upon  a large scale, the Board would eliminatemany of the unnecessary charges with  which both producer and  consumer areburdened  to-day.  As it would  have  all imported supplies under  its control, itwould be in a position to smooth out the fluctuations in price which  disorganizethe business  of agriculture, would secure the  farmer a suitable market in which to sell his produce and  bring corresponding advantages to  the general body of consumers.&quot;  In this  connection it  should be pointed out that our  existing inter-national obligations*  require that a State monopoly in respect of imports wouldhave to be extended to home production.     16.  The main lines on which an Import Board would work have been defined by  Mr. Frank Wise in his address  to the Farmers&apos; Club, to which reference hasalready been made.  He there stated  that the scheme for the establishment of an import Board has been designed with a view to the stabilization of the price at which foreign wheat is sold to British  millers.  The principal features of the scheme, as outlined by Mr. Wise, were :           (a) The whole purchase  and import of foreign wheat for consumption      in this country should be  undertaken by a statutory corporation set up by      Parliament for  this purpose with full monopoly rights of import.          (b) The corporation  should be organized so as to be independent  of      detailed  political control  and should have its own capital necessary for its      purposes guaranteed or  provided by Parliament.  The Board should employ      the best trade  and other experts  available.   It should also  work in close      liaison with millers and other consumers of home and imported wheat.* See Appendix IV.
           (c) The Board should be. required by its terms of reference to invoice       the grain to the millers on a basis of prices to be published beforehand for       as long a period ahead as may be reasonably possible, so calculated, unless       otherwise determined by Parliament, as to  cover costs,  after provision of       proper reserves over the period.           (d) The  Board should have wide discretion to  buy its  wheat in the       most efficient commercial manner, subject  to the understanding that it       would endeavour to make bulk contracts with the centralized co-operative       selling organizations in the Empire and outside  for the purpose of helping       to stabilize prices in the countries of origin,  to facilitate regular transport       and to cheapen financing, insurance and other commercial and intermediate       charges.           (e) In regard to home-produced  wheat, the Import Board should be       required to publish guaranteed stable prices at  proper parity Avith import       prices at which millers or the Board itself would be prepared  to buy during       a  defined  period.  The  price of actual deliveries would  depend on the       quality and condition in each case.  The Board should adjust its supplies       of imported grain to the mills so  as to ensure that a market is available       for all British wheat of mining quality tendered for sale.          (/) The mining industry should be rationalized under national control       on  lines designed to economize  in the production and transport  of flour.       The existence of fixed prices for flour and  better organization  for supply       and transport would enable a much closer control to be exercised over the       costs and profits of the baking industry.     17. An  Import  Board established on the fines  above indicated  would, unlessthe Government and Parliament otherwise decided, make its purchases abroad onthe most favourable terms possible and conduct the whole of its operations so that,over a period, neither  profit nor loss resulted.   The  advantages  which might result from the operations of an Import Board working upon these fines would be-           (i)  the measure of  stabilization  of  prices which the Board was, in       practice, able to afford to home and Dominion producers ; and           (ii) the extent to which economies  in the  purchase and handling of       supplies created a saying, the benefit of which could be distributed to the       home consumer or the home or Dominion producer.To what extent  economies  in  administration and  in  the purchase of imported supplies could reasonably be expected to result from the operations of an ImportBoard is examined later in this memorandum.  Apart  from such economies, it is unlikely that an Import Board could at one and the same time confer advantageson both consumer and producer.     18. To what extent an Import Board, given the advantage of a sole monopolyto import wheat or meat into this country, as well as to  purchase all home produce of the  same  commodity  leaving the farms, might prove  of benefit to the consumerdepends entirely on whether such monopoly would, in practice, work more efficiently and economically than private traders at present engaged in the business.   Theextent to which such a monopoly might benefit the home producer would depend,first, on whether, in fact, any economies resulted from its operations, and, secondly,whether the savings resulting from such  economies were distributed in whole orin part to&apos; the home producer.  To the extent to which the home  producer was allowed to benefit, the consumer could  not benefit.   An Import Board which was required  to  provide  benefits for both  home  and Dominions producers,  without prejudicing the interests  of the home consumer, would need to effect very substantial economies in the handling of all its supplies, as well as to make favourable purchases of that part of its requirements which came from foreign countries.  In the caseof wheat, the British Empire already produces sufficient grain to  meet the whole ofits requirements.  The  more successful the Import Board  proved in satisfyingDominion producers, the greater would be the supplies offered to the Board  from empire sources and the  less would the Board depend on foreign sources of supply.In such circumstances, the field over which economies could be effected withoutinjury to the British producer would, of course, be gradually reduced, until it finallydisappeared  altogether.
    19. The financial considerations involved in the proposal to establish ImportBoards, to which reference is made in the previous paragraph, are of such immenseimportance that it may be useful to restate them in another form.  If the board were required to balance its accounts over a period  and make neither a profit nora loss, there would be only two sources from which it  could effect economies ascompared with the present method of  carrying on the business through privatetraders.  The two sources of economies would be :            (a) by  savings in the cost of transport, financing, insurance and other       commercial and administrative transactions ; and           (b) by  making  purchases  from  producers on  more favourable terms       than are secured by private traders at present engaged in the business.The possibility of effecting administrative economies referred to under  (a) is dealtwith more fully later, but it may here be stated that no evidence has so far been produced as to the ground  on which such economies may be confidently expected.As regards (b), it is clear that, in so far as Import Board supplies come  from homeand Dominion  sources, reduced prices would not prove of  any  advantage to agriculture within the Empire.    20. It follows from the considerations set out in the preceding two  paragraphsthat it is  extremely problematical whether  any  State  monopoly could  be soadministered as to prove an advantage (a) to the consumer in this  country,(b) to the producer in this country, and (c) to the Dominions producer, unless it canbe shown (i) that such a monopoly would be able to effect such substantial economiesas would make an appreciable margin from which advantages could be  distributed among all three interested parties ; or (ii) that producers both in this country andin the Dominions  would benefit by such a measure of price stabilization as theImport Board could give,  even though the average price which it paid to  theseproducers did not differ from the average world price.                               CHAPTER  II.                 ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF  IMPORT BOARDS.    21. In any attempt to assess the value of establishing an Import Board forone or more agricultural commodities, the present depressed state of the farming industry throughout the Empire must be borne in mind.  It follows as a corollaryfrom the present state of the industry that an experiment  in the State control ofsupplies would be inaugurated at a time when  consumers have the advantage of low world prices, and, consequently, any risk which is involved in such an experi-ment need not be expected to bring prices to the consumer up to  a level which wouldbe in any way onerous.  Put briefly, the experiment could at  the present time be entered upon with the maximum advantage to the producer and a minimum risk to the consumer.    22. A State monopoly in respect of a staple commodity such as wheat or meatwould  place the Government of the day in an  unique position to control everytransaction which ultimately affects the price to the consumer.   Only by an actualexperiment of this kind can knowledge be secured as to what economies and savings could be effected through the elimination of competition, the abolition of avoidablefluctuations and the disappearance of all manipulations  designed to create privateprofit.  In the absence of such experiment, estimates of probable results are mereguesswork.  In this connection, reference to the experience gained by the wheat commission and similar bodies during the War cannot be regarded as reliable for present purposes.  In  public  discussions  on  Import  Boards, arguments  havefrequently been advanced, both for and against,  based on war-time experience.For obvious reasons, however, conditions at that time were entirely different fromthose  obtaining at the present day,  and  in this memorandum, therefore, allarguments based on war experience  have been eliminated.
    23. On the assumption that an  Import Board would be required to balanceits accounts over a period and that it would not be used as the machinery fordistributing subsidies provided by the Exchequer to producers, either  in thiscountry or in the British Empire overseas,*the advantages which the operations ofsuch Boards  might be  expected  to  secure  for  growers may be summarized  asfollows :            (a) A reduction in the fluctuation of prices could be achieved by the       Board announcing at intervals the price at which it was prepared to purchase       for as long a period ahead as was fomid to be practicable.           (b) More orderly  marketing would follow from increased stability of       price, and, as a result of the elimination of uncertainty as to price, producers       would be able more readily than at present to obtain financial credit on the       security of unsold produce.           (c) So far as the home grower is  concerned, he would be assured of a       price equivalent to the true parity with the price of imported produce.   So       far as the Dominion producer is concerned, he would be assured of a market       in the United Kingdom at a predetermined price and thereby relieved of       any fear that foreign supplies might deprive him of a remunerative sale.    24. It may be pointed out that, in the absence of preferential tariff rates,bulk purchase provides an alternative method by which the Home government can assist  the  Dominions in return for the tariff advantages  which  DominionGovernments are already giving manufactured goods and other exports from thiscountry as compared with similar foreign goods.  The  source from which suchpreferential prices could be secured might be economies effected in the operations of the  Board itself, or by charging an increased price to the consumer or by meansof a direct grant from the Exchequer.  In either case, the Board could, without difficulty, arrange for a special price to be paid  for home or Dominion produce.In this respect the Import Board machinery has  obvious advantages over eitherProtection or direct subsidies.   In the case  of Protection, the home grower  canonly be benefited to the extent to which prices in this country are increased.   Inthe case of wheat, it would be necessary for the market price of all wheat to beincreased before the home farmer could secure an improved price for his produce,which amounts at present to only one-fifth of the total.  In regard to direct subsidies,no satisfactory system has so far  been devised which would enable a subsidy tobe distributed on the basis of the amount of produce, either grown or marketed.A subsidy based on acreage is obviously not likely to prove an incentive to improvedfarming, and, moreover, in the course of time is bound to be a direct subsidy notto the producer but to the landowner.  Whether the Import Board is charged withthe duties of conveying to the farmer during periods of depression financial assistancefrom the State, or whether it merely distributes among growers the benefit of any economies effected by its operations, it is clear that the assistance thus affordedwill always be applied in such a way as to stimulate production and for the benefitof the industry.    25. Another and very important advantage  claimed for the Import Boardsystem will be in improving the morale of the home producer, which recently hasbeen unduly  depressed on account of the injury resulting from the importation ofbounty-fed  cereals  from  abroad.   Our international  obligations prevent any immediate steps being taken to combat the damage which is being caused by these imports.   The denunciation of relevant treaties would prove prejudicial to national interests other than agricultural, and in the absence of the Import, Board machineryno means appears to be available for handling the difficult situation created by thesebounty-fed imports.  An Import Board  could,  however, readily deal with  thesituation.  It could either decline to purchase such commodities, or, alternatively,it could purchase products which had been subsidised in their country of origin, butin fixing its selling price it could make an allowance for the effect of such subsidy.If the latter course were adopted, it would mean that an additional margin betweenpurchasing costs and -the proceeds of sale would be created which ultimately couldbe used for the benefit of home, and, possibly, Dominion producers.  The result would, therefore, be that instead of bounty-fed imports being a menace to Empireproducers, they would  constitute an additional source from which a preferentialprice might be distributed.
             Advantages from the Point of View of the Dominions.    26. In the case of the commodities, such as wheat, in which the Empire supply-exceeds the United Kingdom demand, arrangements could be made by which theDominions would have an assured market for a definite  minimum proportion oftheir produce.  It is to be observed that the value of this  advantage depends verymaterially upon the nature and objects of the machinery established in the UnitedKingdom, and is in any case  subject to a definite arrangement being made betweenEmpire producers and the purchasing Board.  If the object of the United Kingdommachinery is to benefit the consumer, no such arrangement would be made, pur-chases would be made in the cheapest market and no advantage would accrue to theEmpire producer;  on the contrary, the substitution of a single strong purchaser fora number of comparatively weak individual purchasers  would probably involvea loss on the whole to the producer. If, however, the purchasing Board was under an obligation to offer to take the whole of its supply, or a definite minimum quantity,from the Empire at open market prices, the security thereby afforded in an importantproportion of the world market to an important proportion of the world&apos;s sellerswould probably have a tendency to keep world prices at a  slightly higher and morestable level than would  otherwise be the case.  It is doubtful, however,  whether,in the case of such commodities, Empire producers would regard this as an advantageworth bargaining for.    27. If, however, the purchasing Board is under an obligation not only to offer to take, but actually to take  either the whole of its requirements or a minimumquantity from Empire sources, the Empire producer is placed, to the extent  of theobligation upon the Board, in the position of the holder of a monopoly.   Even ifa limit were placed upon the extent to which the price which the Board might, inthat case, be compelled to  give,  might exceed the world price, the price  would inevitably tend to  reach that limit.  In fact, a definite price at which the produceis to be taken by the  Board would have to be fixed beforehand ; and the advantage to the Empire producer, over and above the advantage shown at (1) above of having an assured market, whatever the world price and however  large the crop, for adefinite amount of his produce, would depend upon the extent to which that priceexceeded the world  price.   This  advantage might, and in most cases would, bevery considerable.   Furthermore, where the disparity  between the fixed price andthe world price was considerable, i.e.,  in the event of a heavy slump in the world price, the producer would be  able to  ensure the sale of the  whole of his crop bydumping the balance on foreign markets.   It is to be  observed, however, (a) thatit is not impossible, particularly in the case of commodities such as wheat,  in whichthe fluctuations in the world price in recent years have tended to be considerable,that after the price at which the Board is to take Empire produce is fixed, the world price might rise above the fixed price, in which cases  the Empire producer  would suffer a loss measured by the extent of the difference in price ;  and (b) that whetherthe fixed price were above or below the world price, the advantage or disadvantageto the Empire producer is precisely  counterbalanced by a  disadvantage  or an advantage to the United Kingdom consumer.     28. An extreme example of the advantage to the producer and the disadvantageto the consumer of an arrangement of this kind is to be seen  in the case  of theQueensland sugar  crop.  The cost of  production in that case is  approximately 20 a ton as against an average world cost of less than half that amount, and thetotal production  exceeds the total Australian consumption by  approximately30 pei cent.  In order to enable the industry to survive,  the import of sugar intoAustralia is prohibited and a price is fixed for the home.market which will enablethe surplus to be sold outside Australia at the world price and a profit to be shown on the whole crop.  At the present moment the fixed price for the domestic marketis approximately  27 10s. and the world price  is below  10.     29. In the case  of commodities in which  the Empire supply is less than theUnited Kingdom demand the advantages mentioned above would also arise.  If,however, the purchasing Board is under obligation to take the whole of the Empireproduction, an increase in  the  Empire production will  presumably take  place.This  will be advantageous to the Dominion  concerned; and by increasing its
power of absorbing manufactured products (as well as emigrants) would, in so faras absorption takes place from  the United Kingdom, be  advantageous to theUnited Kingdom also.    30. In the case of commodities produced in this country as well as in the over-seas parts of the Empire,  the United Kingdom production would, of course, come within the category of Empire production, and, according as the cost of production was greater than, equal to, or less than the cost of production in the oversea partsof the Empire, the home producer would obtain advantages less than, equal to, orgreater than those of the oversea  producer.                               CHAPTER  III.                    ARGUMENTS AGAINST IMPORT BOARDS.                                   General.    31. It has been argued that under existing conditions there is a margin of profitin the distributing trades concerned with the staple products in question whichmight be secured by an Import Board or Boards  for the  benefit of the consumeror of the producer in this country and the Empire overseas.    32. Such information as is available regarding the profits in certain food tradeshas recently been analysed and the results are given in the Memorandum annexed to this Report (Appendix I).   The conclusion would appear to be that there is nosuch margin of  profit in the wholesale food trades as would enable any appreciablebenefit to be given either to producers or consumers by the supersession of private trade.    33. It must be borne in mind that,  if, as appears probable, it  was necessaryto supersede private trade entirely in the commodities to  be  dealt with,  so far aswholesale  operations are concerned,  claims would arise for compensation for lossof profits and goodwill and it would also be necessary to make provision for working capital.  An attempt was made in March, 1930, to estimate,  as regards the grain,milling, meat and sugar trades, the liabilities which on certain tentative  assumptionsthe Exchequer might be called upon to meet and the results are  shown in the annexedMemorandum (Appendix II).    34. It has been urged in some quarters that centralized  bulk purchase wouldenable large economies to be made in transport, handling and  distribution.   Anysuch claims must necessarily be conjectural and the contrary opinion may equallywell be held.  It is equally doubtful whether the bargaining strength of a Statemonopoly would, in fact, be greater than that of the existing individual organiza-tions.   It may be urged, for example, that the very fact that Great  Britain hadconcentrated the whole of its purchasing of imported  wheat into the hands of  asingle body would put the country more at the mercy of exporting organizationsabroad than before.  When the monopoly  entered the  market,  the organizedexporters would know exactly what it had previously bought  :  what its real needswere ; whether it must buy at  any price or  whether it could afford  to refuse an offer.   It  is certain, indeed, that the concentration of a marketing business in oneagency must give rise to special difficulties, beyond the question whether the stateorganization is likely to be  as skilful in  trading as the private merchant.  when there are  a number of dealers in a market, the prices quoted and the stocks heldare the resultant of a number  of independent judgments and mistakes tend  to cancel out.  When the business is concentrated in a single organization, there canbe no such compensation.   The penalty for  any miscalculation on the part of  aWheat Import  Board, for instance, might be very serious.  The recent history ofthe Canadian Wheat Pool is an actual example of the results of such a miscalculation.The prices ndw are actually less than the Wheat Pool paid to the farmer on account.A State Import Board would, moreover, differ from private firms in having definiteresponsibilities to the consumer which  would  often make it necessary  for it  to sacrifice profits for the sake of security.    .
     35.  It must further be remembered that an Import Board which involves thesocialization of an important branch of commerce must, besides making provisionfor interest on the capital which it uses, pay over to the Exchequer the equivalent of the taxation previously paid out of the profits of private traders.  otherwise the process of socializing industry will deprive the Exchequer of the revenue needed for the general purposes of the State.  The Import Board must also make adequate provision for the  savings formerly made out of the private profits and invested in maintaining and  developing the industrial equipment of the country.  The com-munity could not afford to devote to the consumer or to the producer all the profitwhich it might make through an Import Board.  Besides providing interest on capital  and taxation it must devote some part of its profits, if any, to capitalpurposes (e.g., additional sinking fund or remunerative public works).     36. In the fight of the foregoing considerations  it is  submitted that on theavailable evidence there is no warrant for the assumption that centralized purchasewould set free any substantial sums which would either enable benefits to be givento the consumer in this country or a higher price to be paid to producers at homeand throughout the Empire than the market parity would justify without requiring the consumer or taxpayer to contribute.     37. In  the important case of sugar,  as regards which strong demands havebeen made for assistance to the Colonial producer by means of an Import Board,it is clear that the desired object could not be secured without imposing a substantialburden upon the consumers or the taxpayers of this country.   The probable amountof this burden is analysed in the annexed note  which was recently prepared on lord Olivier&apos;s proposal to establish an Import Board for Sugar (Appendix III).    38. Somewhat different considerations arise in the case of other commodities,but it may be confidently asserted that  in no case  would it  be possible for an import  Board to offer substantial advantages both to the  consumer at home andto the producer throughout the Empire.  It is obvious that the larger the proportionof the supplies obtained from within the Empire, the more unlikely is  it that anenhanced price could be offered to the Empire producers without raising the costto the consumer.    39. It has been urged in some quarters that the certainty of a market for a proportion of his crop at a stable price would be of material  benefit to the producer,even though that price merely represented the  average open market price. in existing circumstances it seems unlikely  that such an offer  would be  acceptableas it would in no way meet the widespread claim that market prices do not covereven costs of production.   The producer  would repeat that  &quot; the stabilization ofprices is the stabilization of ruin &quot;.    40. Whatever may be the arguments for the substitution of  State for privateenterprise in particular branches of industry and commerce, it is  for consideration whether as a broad conclusion emerging from the foregoing examination, a sufficientcase can be established for such a vast and far-reaching change as the adoption ofbulk purchase of  staple commodities for the purpose of assisting the producer athome or in the Empire overseas.   It is arguable that for such a purpose the methodis likely to be more cumbrous, less certain  in  its results,  and more calculated to cause friction  or difficulty than the alternative methods of  tariffs  or  directsubsidies.       Disadvantages from the point of view of an Imperial Economic Policy.    41. It is probable that the purchaser in this country would be the government itself or some public authority, indistinguishable in oversea eyes from the Govern-ment, and that the oversea seller, if not the Government of the Dominion concerned,would be or would rapidly become av single organization in each Dominion looking to the  Dominion Government for protection and assistance.  In effect, therefore,whenever the price had to be  fixed, negotiations would be between the UnitedKingdom Government  and the Dominion Government concerned.  Such negotia-tions would be upon a matter in which public interest on either side would be
closely interested,  and on which neither Government  could afford to appear tohave driven a bad bargain.  It may be feared that they would tend&quot;to be prolonged and stubborn and perhaps, in the end, bitter, and in most cases either the UnitedKingdom consumer or the Dominion producer or both would feel that his interestshad been sacrificed to those of the other.  If this was  so. the effect first on therelations between  the Governments  and secondly on  the relations between the peoples concerned might be deplorable.    42. Prices might be fixed either annually, or to  cover a period of years.  Inthe first case negotiations as to  next year&apos;s  price would be proceeding almostcontinuously and the question of price would tend to be a perpetual and continuingsource of irritation.  If, on the other hand, prices were fixed  over a period of yearsand the world price were to fluctuate at all considerably, other sources of irritationwould probably arise on the one side or the other.  If we assume that the  periodicalprice  fixing for the purchase of wheat had fallen due  last July,  the price would presumably have been fixed at something above $1-40, which was then  the world price.   It is difficult to suppose that  now that the world price has fallen to 90c.there would not be grave  discontent, and there would be strong political pressure upon the Government to give the consumer the benefit  of falling prices at the costof the taxpayer.   Suppose on the contrary that world prices were to rise appreciablyabove the fixed price.   It  would no doubt be possible, in spite of agitation, to hold the British farmer to his bargain, though very difficult if it actually became profit-able,  for example, for him to export his produce.  There would probably be strong pressure from the  Dominion Government for  a revision of the bargain, and if this were  not conceded it would probably be impossible to prevent  the Dominion  orColonial producers, or at  any rate a considerable number of them, from breakingaway and seeking the most profitable market  that they could find. - In a period offluctuating  prices  like  the  present, an  Import Board established to purchaseDominion or Colonial produce in bulk with a view to stabilization of price, wouldcertainly risk getting the worst of both worlds, whether prices rose or fell.     43.  In the case of a commodity, such as wheat, in which the Empire productionexceeds  the United Kingdom  consumption,  the further difficulty of  allocatingpurchases  among  the various Empire sources of supply would  arise.  It wouldprobably be recognized by the Dominions that it was reasonable that the purchasingBoard should take the whole of the United  Kingdom production, but on whatprinciple would the remainder of the  United Kingdom demand be apportioned asbetween the Dominions ?   Whatever principle were to be adopted, it is  difficult tosee how friction could be avoided, if, indeed, there were  any advantage in supplying the United Kingdom rather than the foreign market.     44. Furthermore, the Dominions would undoubtedly expect that when possiblethe United Kingdom would supply the whole or the greater part of her needs from empire sources, and in the case of other commodities that the United kingdom would riot purchase foreign supplies until the Empire supplies were exhausted.This would have a most serious effect  upon our very important foreign trade.  the goodwill towards  this country, which is so  important a commercial asset, wouldbe lost in the foreign countries affected, and some of them might even  proceed to actual retaliation against our goods.  Moreover, certain direct consequences would hebound to flow from the  diversion of our purchase from foreign to Empire countries. As an outstanding example may be taken the diversion of the wheat we now purchase in Argentina to Canada.  The development of Argentina has been wrought mainly by British capital, and some  500 millions  of  British capital is invested in that country.  Our export trade to Argentina is almost as valuable as that to. Canada, while the export of coal to Argentina is dependent on  the ships  carrying coal out- wards being able to carry grain homewards.   It might well  be, therefore, that any advantages gained from diverting purchases of wheat from Argentina  to Canada would be more than offset by the losses resulting to our  trade with  Argentina. Apart from actual retaliation or measurable loss of this kind, however, it is to be remembered that our visible exports of manufactured goods to foreign countries, while they are by no means precisely measured by our imports from those countries, do at any rate&apos;to some extent depend upon them, and that unless the loss  necessarily occasioned by any sudden and drastic change in the channels of foreign  trade such
as is under consideration is more than offset by an increase in our exports of manu-factured goods  to  the Dominions, the&apos; effect upon our trade as a whole might be serious.    45. Finally, it is to be observed that the system, once initiated, could hardly be discontinued without a serious shock to the whole economic and political systemof the Empire.                               CHAPTER IV.        SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS  AFFECTING PARTICULAR COMMODITIES.    46. So far, this memorandum has dealt only with the general principles under-lying the proposals  concerned with the bulk purchase of Dominion produce, pricestabilization and the establishment of Import Boards.  No  attempt  has beenmade to examine any of these questions in relation to particular commodities, nor,indeed, has time been available for such enquiry.   The most superficial examination,however, is sufficient to indicate that each commodity would present its own special problems.  No doubt the Government, before taking a final decision to establish an Import Board for any commodity, would take steps to ensure that it was supplied with adequate information as to the technical and other difficulties which would arise in regard to that particular commodity.  It is not practicable here to do morethan indicate, in regard to three  or four of the most important agricultural products,the general nature of  the problems which would have to be faced.                                   Wheat.    47. In the case of wheat, our total supplies in the  last  five years have been derived as regards 19 per cent, from home sources, 42 per cent, from other parts ofthe Empire, and 39 per cent, from outside the Empire.  The  aggregate productionof wheat from within the Empire is sufficient, at the present time, to provide forall the wheat requirements at home and in the Dominions.  It consequently follows that, if the price at which an Import Board were prepared to purchase imported supplies was regarded as satisfactory by the Dominions, pressure would be appliedto the  Import Board to  restrict its purchases to Empire sources.  The effect ofany such development on our foreign trade and, more particularly, on our com-mercial relationship with the Argentine, has already been referred to earlier inthis Memorandum.  Apart from such considerations, however, it is clear that somesteps would have to be taken,  sooner or later,  to allocate the purchases betweenthe different Dominions.  If the  scheme  proved attractive to wheat-exportingDominions, New Zealand and South Africa would presumably urge .the adoptionof a similar scheme for controlling the imports into the United Kingdom of com-modities in which those Dominions would be interested.    48. Another problem would almost certainly arise in connection  with wheat flour.  The probability is that  wheat flour would have to be  brought under thesame control  as wheat grain.  To what  extent  it would be  practicable for  an import Board to restrict its purchases of wheat flour in the interests  of the agri-cultural and mflling industries  and of employment in this country, it is not easy to foresee.   It may safely be assumed that any attempt  to reduce the importationof,  for  example,  Canadian  flour  below  the level obtaining  previous  to  theestablishment of the Import Board, would be met with  serious criticism from theCanadian Government.  Nor is it  practicable  to state with any certainty thatthe control by means of  an Import Board of purchases of wheat grain and wheat flour would not  have  to be extended to other grains which compete with,.and arealternative to, wheat offals for certain purposes.    49. Another problem in connection with wheat  is that  the  home  production is practically limited to England, comparatively little wheat being grown in Scotlandand Wales.  In so far as any advantage was derived by wheat growers through theoperations of the Wheat Import  Board, farmers in other parts of the United kingdom would probably demand equivalent benefit.
                                  - Meat.    50. Home  production  accounts, at  the  present time, for  approximately40 per cent, of Great Britain&apos;s total supplies of meat.   The remainder is made upof 17 per cent, from British countries overseas and 43 per cent, foreign.  For thepurposes of this memorandum, however, it will be desirable to consider each classof meat separately.    51. In the case of beef, 43 per cent, is home produced, 13 per cent, comes fromthe Dominions, and 44 per cent, from foreign countries, chiefly the Argentine.  by far the largest and an increasing proportion of the imported supplies are chilled,and the Dominions are not in a position to supply chilled  beef which the consumerin this country wants.  The Dominions  supply about 45 per cent, of frozen beef,which already has an effective price preference from H.M. Forces.    52. In the case of mutton  and lamb, the proportions are : Home produce,44 per cent.., Dominions, 34  per cent., and foreign countries,  22 per cent.  NewZealand sends the great bulk of Dominion supplies and its marketing organizationis very.powerful.   Australian supplies fluctuate enormously owing to drought andwool prices.    53. In the case of pig meat, home, production accounts for 32 per cent., foreignsupplies for 54  per cent., and Dominions  14 per cent., the greater  part of which comes from the Irish Free State.    54. In view of the facts briefly summarized in the three preceding paragraphs,it is not easy to see in what manner the  operations of a Meat Import Board couldassist Dominion producers, except, possibly, in  the case  of mutton and lamb, solong as imported  supplies continue to come from approximately  the same sourcesas at present.   It has, however, frequently been urged that if Australian producers(and no doubt the same applies to South Africa and other parts of the Empire)could be given  an assured market for beef in this country, they would be quitecapable, in the course of a few years, of increasing their stocks of  cattle and under-taking the supply of that portion of the home  requirements allocated to them.The same applies  to a lesser extent to the supply of pig meat from the Dominions.It may be assumed, however, that the assurance required by Australian and other dominion producers would apply not merely to quantity but also to price.  Therisk involved in contracting for the bulk purchase of Dominion meat for a periodbeginning several years ahead is obvious and need not be expanded here.  Apartfrom the possibility of an Import Board operating in the manner just indicated,the benefit which  it could bestow upon home producers and home consumers wouldbe governed by the same general  considerations  as  have been set out earlier inthis memorandum.                                    Wool.    55. Wool is  an important  product  of some  Dominions.  Of the  imports of wool into Great Britain during the last five years, 83 per cent., valued at  54 millions per annum on the average, has come from Empire countries.  An  Import board for wool would therefore have only a very limited field in which it could hope tosecure  favourable purchases of  supplies  from foreign sources.  Moreover, wool isan industrial product.  There are numerous varieties, and exports and re-exportsaccount for one-half of the imports into the United Kingdom.  England is a world market for wool,  which does not necessarily arrive here for consumption in thiscountry.  An Import Board for wool would therefore  need to take into account therequirements not  only of domestic, but also of foreign, buyers.                            Minor Commodities.    56. It has been suggested that, in view of the very considerable financial andother risks involved in the application of a system of bulk purchase to such staple commodities as wheat, wool, and  meat, the total imports of which amount to approximately  68 millions,  65 millions, and  110 millions per annum  (includingbacon, etc.), respectively, an &quot; experiment &quot;. might  be  tried with a commodityor commodities&apos; of which the total consumption  in this country is comparatively small.   It is anticipated by those who support this suggestion that an experimentof this kind would afford valuable data on which a decision whether  or not to embark on the bulk purchase of  the staple commodities could be based.
    57. The following considerations appear to arise in connection with any such proposal :            (a) It would probably be impracticable to make any such experiment      with a single commodity, inasmuch as such a limitation would be held to give      undue advantage to one part or some parts of the Empire (namely, the part      or parts producing the commodity in question) as against other parts.  The      list of commodities* on which it  was proposed, as a result of the Conference      of 1923, to grant preferential tariffs, was drawn up with a view to distributing      the advantages of such tariffs as equitably as possible throughout the Empire;      and it would probably be found desirable to apply any such experiment      to the  whole of this list, in so far at any rate as preferential  tariffs have not      already been granted on some of the commodities in question.           (b) While, on the  one hand, the amount involved in the bulk purchase      of any one of such  commodities is comparatively  small  in relation to the      amount involved in  the bulk purchase of, e.g,, wheat, the amount involved      in the application of such a system to the whole of the commodities included      in the &quot; 1923 list &quot;  is  considerable.  The aggregate value  of the imports      of the 1923 commodities (other than sugar, tobacco, and wine) is  29 millions,      as against   68 millions,  65 millions, and  110 millions,  in respect of wheat,      wool, and meat.           (c) Furthermore,  inasmuch as  the  United  Kingdom  demand  for  all      these commodities fluctuates between far wider limits  than in the  case of      wheat, wool, and meat (the consumption of which can be foretold with some    .  degree of accuracy,  and is not susceptible as is the consumption of, e.g.,      tinned fruits to a rapid increase in response to a fall in price), the danger      of a comparatively heavy loss is substantially greater.           (d) The difficulties as to price and allocation noted  above apply with      as much force to a limited as to an unlimited experiment.           \e)  It  would probably be found in practice impossible to limit such      an experiment to the &quot; 1923 &quot; commodities.  In particular,  it would appear      to be out of the  question to apply such an  experiment to  commodities of      particular  interest to the Dominions, without at the same time applying      it to sugar.          (/) To initiate  such  an experiment and then, after trial, to abandon      it on the  ground that it was  unduly  onerous to the  United  Kingdom      consumer  (and /or taxpayer)  would  lead to difficulty.  &quot; Experiments &quot;      of this kind have a strong tendency, in the economic  no less than in the      constitutional sphere, to become permanent, provided at any rate that they      are not found in practice to be disadvantageous to the Dominions.    58. Some of the principal issues that arise in considering any project for theestablishment of Import Boards have been set out :  it is suggested that they indicate the desirability of deciding in the first instance what is the purpose which they are intended to. serve.    59. They have been suggested as a means of securing economies for the benefitof consumers by eliminating speculation  and private profit, and it was hoped thatthey would at the same time afford more stable prices  to producers.  Since thenworld prices have in many cases fallen below costs of production, and consequentlyproducers want, not stabilization, but higher prices.  It  was therefore suggestedthat an Import Board by buying  cheaply abroad could afford to give higher prices to home producers, and that by averaging its purchases and by making use of the economies of large scale transactions it could provide the  necessary supplies withoutany material increase of price to the consumer.   * Dried and preserved fruits, sugar, tobacco, wine, raw apples, canned salmon, lobster, etc., honey,fruit juices.
    60. The scheme has also been linked up with the desire to give preferentialterms in our market to, the produce of the Overseas Empire and to the extent towhich this is secured the benefit to the consumer disappears.    61. In  these  circumstances  the  question arises  whether  the scheme  hasadvantages which are commensurate with the risks to our foreign trade, the dangerof friction in our Imperial relations, the probability of increasing the cost of living,and  the serious  financial,  legislative and  administrative difficulties which  theestablishment of Import Boards would entail.26th July, 1930.

Since the war margins and profits in the food  distributing trades have been examined by the  Report ofLinlithgow Committee (1923) and the Royal Commission on Food Prices (1925).  The former Committee  Linlithgowinvestigated the trades in (1) Milk and Milk Products ; (2) Fruit and Vegetables ; (3) Meat,  Poultry  Committee,and Eggs ;  and (4) Cereals, Flour and  Bread.  The Committee&apos;s conclusions were described as followsby the official witness of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in his evidence before the RoyalCommission on Food Prices (Cmd. 2390-Vol. II-Q.  150):            &quot; As regards the general conclusion of the Committee on the broad question of the disparity       in price, it is stated in the final  Report that the spread between producers&apos; and consumers&apos;       prices is unjustifiably wide.   I do not know that the evidence that was obtained indicated any       general prevalence of  what would be described as excessive profits ; individual examples  of       wide margins were given, but on  the whole they were generally exceptional and local.&quot;    The Committee&apos;s criticisms  of food traders were, in fact, largely directed against the allegedinefficient organization of distribution.   On this point it may be remarked that rationalization of food distribution must involve compulsion  and must be a lengthy process.*   It could be of no  immediatebenefit to producers, even if consumers, in spite of the interference with their own habits and preferenceswhich  the process would necessitate, were willing to allow any savings effected to be transferred  to producers.    2. The Royal Commission said:  &quot; We have been forced to the conclusion that at least some  Report ofpurchasers of bread and meat have to pay an unfairly high price for the loaves and joints which they  Commissionactually receive.  In saying this, we do not bring any general accusation of dishonest trading or of  on FG0(Jprofiteering against dealers in wheat, flour, bread or meat &quot; the only trades the Commission considered.  Prices, 1925.(Cmd. 2390, Vol. I, paragraph 6.)  The Commission then went on  to point  out  that the increase  inthe general price level over 1913 was between 60 and 80 per cent., and that, generally speaking, food prices had risen no more than average prices compared with 1913 (paragraphs 23 and 24).               II. Profits of Distributors of Home-produced Meat and Breadstuffs.    3. Wholesalers in the meat trade consist of carcase butchers, commission salesmen, jobbers and  Meat .*importers.  Importers do not deal with home-killed meat, generally speaking, and jobbing is no longer  Wholesale.an important feature of the trade.  Except in Smithfield, carcase butchers are also commissionsalesmen.  The carcase  butcher buys his supplies on the hoof, direct from farmers, from dealers, or at an auction mart.  He sells generally to retail meat traders, but also to hotels, restaurants and publicinstitutions.  The commission salesman at Smithfield handles only dead meat, is believed to deal with two-thirds of the home-killed meat disposed of in the market, and sells to jobbers or retail butchers.Wholesale carcase butchers and commission salesmen may also do a jobbing business.  (M.  of A.and F. Economic Series Report No. 20, pp.  100-101, and Linlithgow Committee Report, paragraphs 57,58 and 61.)   Owing to the great variety of the trade, home-killed meat may reach the retail butcher direct fromthe farmer, or may pass through the hands of one,  two  or three  intermediaries.  No single pricestructure can therefore show the costs and profits which intervene between the  producer and  theconsumer.  As, however, broadly speaking, all  meat sold  in the important consuming areas is on a competitive basis, it is perhaps sufficient to take as typical a case where there is only one intermediary(the  wholesale carcase butcher).    Profits of Wholesale Carcase  Btitchers. The Linlithgow Committee stated that the wholesalerwho  purchases stock in the country districts and rails  them to the city or town for slaughter appearsto obtain about  10 per cent, gross profit upon the sale of  the carcase and offals.   (Report on  Meat,paragraph 148.)   The equivalent net profit is not definitely stated, but the net profit of the wholesaler* See Annex for numbers of food traders controlled by the Ministry of Food.
           buying in the city or town livestock market, has been estimated at from 1 to 2\ per cent, on turnover           (paragraph  149).  The Royal Commission said that &quot; the business of a wholesale carcase butcher is           a highly speculative one, since he had to buy live cattle in competition with retail butchers and sell           dead meat at prices at which the retail butcher is prepared to buy.  In order to obtain a livelihood he           must have  a relatively large  turnover with a  small fraction of a  penny per  pound  net profit.&quot;           (Paragraph  252.)                Assuming that 24- per cent, net  profit on turnover  fairly represents the profit of the wholesale           carcase butcher on the carcase and offals, the equivalent per live cwt. of cattle and per lb. dead weight           of fat sheep may be calculated as follows : (a) Cattle.        The average price of cattle live weight in England and Wales in  1928 (1st and 2nd quality) was           51s. 5(2. per  cwt.   The carcase butcher&apos;s gross profit of 10 per cent, on sales is equivalent to 11-1 per           cent, on cost price, and his sale price  (carcase and offals) will therefore be 57s. Id. per cwt.                The carcase butcher&apos;s net profit of 2\ per cent, on a sale price of 57s. Id. per cwt. = Is. 5d. per           cwt. of cattle. .                 Conclusion. The producers price (1928) would therefore be increased from 51s. od. to 52s. 10(2.                     per cwt. if  the carcase butcher&apos;s net profit were transferred to him.               Profits of Commission Salesmen. Gross commission = Ad. per stone of 8 lb. of meat (approximately           6 per cent, on sales at 1928 value of beef).  There are no figures as to net profits, but these are unlikely           to exceed 2\ per cent, on sales.  The net profits are made on about 56 per cent, of the live weight of           cattle. In view of the calculation made above for the  carcase butcher, it appears to be unnecessary to           make a separate calculation for commission salesmen, particularly as it would apply to sales of meat           only and not to the whole carcase.[b) Sheep.       The average price of fat sheep in England and Wales in 1928 (1st and 2nd quality) was 13-5(2.           per lb. dead weight.*  The carcase butcher&apos;s sale price with an average gross profit of 10 per cent,  on           sales, or 11 -1 per cent, on cost, would be 15-Oif. per lb. dead weight.               The carcase butcher&apos;s  net profit of 2\  per cent, on a sale price of  15-0(2. per lb. -  -38a!. per lb.                  Conclusion. -The producers price of fat sheep (1928) would therefore be increased from 13-50(2.                      to 13-88(2. per lb. dead weight if the carcase butcher&apos;s net profit were transferred to him.Meat Retail.      4. There is no information as to the average net profit on home-killed beef as distinct from other(a) Beef.    kinds of meat.   The average net profit ascertained by the Food Council as having been made by private           traders owning less  than 8 shops on  sales of all meat in 1926  and 1927,- after allowing management           remuneration, was 4 - 5 per cent.  The average retail price of good quality English beef in London in           1928 was approximately 13-5(2. per lb., including bone and waste.  The average price of cattle, live           weight in England and Wales, in 1928 (1st and 2nd quality) was 51s. 5d. per cwt.  The retailers&apos;s net           profit of  -61(2. per lb. (Ij^ X  13-5^ is made on  about 56  per cent,  of  the  live weight,  and is                                      T                56&quot;           equivalent to 3s. 2d. per cwt.  -61(2. X  112 x ^                The Food Councils report gave the following results for other classes of retail butchers :                       Limited companies (less than 8 shops)........4-7 per cent, on sales.                      Multiple  shop  firms (private  traders and limited  companies,                      8 shops or more)  ..     ....      ..     ......3 - 6 per cent, on sales.                  Conclusion. If the net profits on home-killed  beef of the wholesale carcase butcher  and the                      retail butcher are added together and transferred to the producer, the result is as follows :                         Net profit of wholesale  carcase butcher (see paragraph  3 (a)                          above)................Is. 5(2. per live cwt.

The average retail price of good quality English mutton in London in  1928 was approximately           16-0(2. per lb.  (Average of prices charged by the C.S.S.A., Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society, and           Messrs. Sainsbury&apos;s.)   The retailer&apos;s average net profit of 4 - 5 per cent, on sales is therefore equivalent           to -72(2. per lb.                  Conclusion. If the net profits on home-killed mutton of the wholesale carcase butcher and the                      retail butcher are added together and transferred to the  producer of sheep, the net  result                      is as follows :                         Net profit of wholesale carcase butcher [see paragraph 3 (b)                          above)         ..     ..    ..     ..     ..     ..      ..   -38(2. per lb. deadweight.                        Net profit of retail butcher    ..     ..     ..     ..      ..   -72(2.            ,,                                                                Total    ..      .. 1-1(2.    * This figure is taken from the Agricultural Statistics, 1928-29, and is understood to be obtained by dividing the price paid to the fanner by the estimated dressed carcase weight.
    5. There is no information as to the profits earned by the merchant dealing in British wheat, but  Wheat.the Linlithgow Committee pointed out that producers had made no complaint, and were apparentlysatisfied that the merchant did not derive an undue profit from his transactions.  Two-thirds of thewheat marketed into the eastern and midland counties of England and one-third of the wheat marketedinto the Home and southern counties is, moreover, purchased direct by millers.  (Report on Cereals,paragraphs 60 and 37.)    Economic. Series Report No. 18 states that some merchants work on a commission basis for millers,and this trade is done on a commission of 3d. or 6d. a quarter.   This figure does not, of course, indicate the net profit.    6. The miller&apos;s net profits in 1924 were proved to the Royal Commission to have been 3-9d. per  Milling.sack of 280 lb. in 1922-23 and Is. per sack of 280 lb. in 1923-24.  There are no later figures, but state-ments have frequently been made in trade papers in the last few years that the industry as a whole has not been remunerative, and it has  recently adopted a rationalization scheme.       Conclusion. No account can be taken of the merchants profit, which is unknown.  In any          case he takes no part in a large proportion of the trade.  If the assumed milling profit of          Is. a sack (280 lb.) of flour is added to the producers price, the result is an increase in the          price of wheat of approximately Is.  3a!. a quarter of 504 lb.    7. The baker&apos;s profit has been estimated at about 4s. per sack of flour of 280 lb. (R.C.F.P. Report,paragraph 85).  A quarter (5041b.) of English wheat produces approximately 3501b. of flour.      Conclusion. If the baker&apos;s net profit of 4s. a sack is added to the producers price, the result          is an increase in the price of wheat of 5s. a quarter of 504 lb.Baking.                 III. Profits of Distributors of Imported Meat and Breadstuffs.    8. It is estimated that the average profit on importation of Argentine chilled beef since the &quot; meatwar &quot; ended in October, 1927,  was about - 175a!. per lb. to 31st December, 1929.    Assuming that this profit were  made on all  kinds of beef, mutton and lamb imported from allcountries, the  aggregate annual net profit earned by the importers would be  1,505,000, made up asfollows:- .                                           Total Imports 1929.                                                cwt.                Beef    ..     ..     ..      12,666,812                Mutton and lamb     ..       5,767,146Meatimporters.                                             18,433,958 x 112 x -175*2. =  1,505,000.    9. The records of the Ministry of Food show that in 1918 1,681 meat wholesalers were controlledin Great Britain.  The number has probably increased since that date.  The Board of Trade possessno information which would enable an estimate to be made of the total net profits of meat wholesalers.    10. It is estimated that the total value of beef, veal, mutton and lamb consumed in Great britain would, if  sold retail by butchers, be  approximately  190 millions.  A deduction should be  madefor meat sold by restaurants, hotels, etc., which does not pass through  the hands of the retail butcher.It is impossible, however, to give any definite figure for this.    If it is assumed that the retail butcher sells meat to the value of  170 million per annum, and thathis average net profit on turnover is 4-5 per cent., the total  figure for net profits of the retail tradein both imported and home-grown beef, veal, mutton and lamb is   7,650,000.  Of this sum it isestimated that   3,500,000 is  the proportion earned on imported meat.   It may be noted that theco-operative societies  claim to do about 20 per cent, of the  total retail meat trade of the country[vide &quot; Report of the Municipal Trade  Inquiry &quot; published by the Co-operative Union, Ltd., in 1928).    11. Evidence offered to the Royal Commission on Food Prices showed that a figure of   per cent.on turnover would be regarded by wheat importers as satisfactory.  (Report, paragraph 175.)   this rate of net profit on the value of imported wheat (approximately  58 million in 1929) gives a figure of 290,000 per annum, or say  300,000.   The figure covers any merchanting profits made by millers on wheat imported for their own use.    12. The remuneration aimed at by the flour importer, distributing direct to the baker, is stated tobe Is. per sack.  (Royal Commission on Food Prices, Report, paragraph 124.)   This appears to be amaximum figure for the importers&apos; gross profit, for, in giving evidence, the representative of the national association of Flour Importers stated that the importer was frequently compelled by force of circum-stances to take much less than Is. per sack, and that this figure had to cover his establishment charges,cables and all other expenses. (Q. 4177, 4179.)    Flour imports into Great  Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927-29 averaged about 9,800,000 cwts.(3,900,000 sacks) valued at  7 million approximately. Importers&apos; gross profits can therefore be estimatedat not more than  200,000 per annum. There is no information as to net profits.    13. The yearly output of flour from mills in Great Britain was about 33 million sacks in 1924(Census of Production, 1924).  Assuming the net profit on milling to be Is. a sack (see paragraph above) the total profits of flour millers in Great Britain would be about  1,650,000 per annum.  Of thetotal production of flour, nine-tenths at least may be estimated to be milled from imported wheats.(Linlithgow  Committee Report on Cereals, paragraph 74, E.C. Series Report No.  18, pp.  22-3.)  Itis believed that the  co-operative mills produce about 20 per cent, of  the flour manufactured inGreat  Britain.Meatwholesalers.Meatretailers.Wheatimports.Flourimporters&apos;profits.Total profits of millers onflour madefromimportedwheat.(C 1229)
    14. The output of bread from bakeries in Great Britain in 1924 was about 1,600 million 4 lb. loaves(Census of Production, 1924).  The present output of bakeries can be estimated at about 1,700 million4 lb. loaves.  Taking-the yield of bread from a sack of flour at 93 4 lb. loaves, the flour used by bakersin the manufacture, of bread may be estimated to amount to about 18J million sacks a year.   If it is assumed that the bakers&apos; net profit is 4s. a sack of flour used (see paragraph 7 above), the total net profit may be estimated at  3,650,000 a year.  Co-operative societies claim that they sell at least one-quarter of the bread sold by bakers.  It may be estimated that about three-quarters of a millionsacks of flour made from British wheat are used annually in. baking bread.

The difference between the total of flour imports and flour milled in Great Britain (nearly37 million sacks) and the 18  million sacks used  in baking bread; is. accounted for by  flour used inconfectionery, biscuits, household cooking and baking and exports.)

Statistics on this subject were specially prepared by the Inland Revenue  for presentation tothe Royal Commission on  Food Prices  and the Committee on National Debt and Taxation.  Nolater figures are available,  and  the  Inland Revenue  state that the preparation of more up-to-datefigures would take time and could not be put in hand before the Budget.Evidence given to the Royal Commission on Food Prices in 1925.   (Report Vol. Ill, Appendix LXXVII I.)    The statistics relate only to traders,  private or corporate,  whose annual trade profit had at sometime within the preceding seven years reached a sum in the region of  2,000.  The statistics showed fora series of four years the relation between profit and turnover for  a number of concerns in various branches of the wholesale and retail food trades.   The  average number of the wholesale and retailfirms included in the returns was 1,106 and 840 respectively.    Mr. Coates (then Director of the Statistics and Intelligence Branch of the Inland Revenue) pointedout in his evidence that as the statistics related only to those firms which at some time in recent yearsmade a profit of  2,000 or more per annum; it was not unlikely that they failed to include a fair propor-tion of the.less profitable businesses.    The following table summarises the detailed evidence given to the Royal Commission. - It shouldbe pointed out that the figures for companies are less management expenses, and those for individuals and firms include any remuneration due to the proprietor in respect of management.

The following tables also furnished by the Inland Revenue to the Royal Commission on food prices, enable a comparison to be made in certain years between profits earned in the food distributingtrades and profits earned in distributive trades as a whole (including food trades).  It will be observedthat in the four post-war years profits earned by both wholesale and retail distribution were lower inthe food trades except in the case of wholesale distribution in 1921-22, when the  profits earned inwholesale distribution of food were slightly higher than the average for all trades.Profits ofbakers onbread made from flourmilled fromimportedwheat.

The suggestion for a sugar Import Board has not (like the proposal for the wheat ImportBoard) been put forward for the purpose of assisting either the home producer or the home consumer.Its object is to assist the West Indian and Mauritius producer, who is unable to compete with cheapCuban and Java sugar at present prices.  It is understood that the cost of production in the west indies is approximately 02 17s. Gd. per ton and in Mauritius  13 per ton, whereas to-day Cuban sugarcan be bought c.i.f. U.K. at approximately  8 per ton. Any profits obtained from the elimination ofprivate traders engaged in importing and refining sugar by the operation of an Import Board would therefore, on this  line of argument, be  transferred to producers  of British Empire sugar.  UnitedKingdom producers are, in fact,  already safeguarded for the moment by the subsidy.    19. The Food Council have had no occasion to conduct an  enquiry  into sugar, since  sugar isgenerally regarded by the retailer as a &quot; give away &quot; article, and he more often makes a loss than a profit on  it.  From a statement  recently made by the Sugar  Retailers&apos; Association of  London(&quot; Grocer,&quot; 8th February,  1930), it appears that the gross  profit made  on sugar  does not  coverexpenses even after three years&apos; of effort by the Association to  secure a  net profit.  There seems,therefore, no  opportunity, by  means of State intervention  in the retail sale of sugar, to obtainmoney for the benefit of producers either at home or overseas,  unless the retail price is increased.
    20. From the Reports of the Royal Commission on Sugar Supplies, which controlled all imports during the war, it appears that the sugar trade (apart from manufacturers using sugar and retailers)is divided into three classes (1) refiners ;  (2) brokers ; and (3) wholesale firms (primary and secondary).The only information which the Board of Trade possess  regarding profits earned by brokers is astatement in the First Report of the Royal Commission that a brokerage of \ per cent, was allowed bythe Commission to the trade.    It is not known what proportion of the sugar imports passes through thehands of brokers or how many brokers there are.  It is clear, however, from the size of the businessdone by refiners (see below) who mainly import their own sugar that the proportion of the home tradein the hands of the  brokers is not very large.    Wholesalers. The Ministry of Food figures show that in 1918 there were 6,503 sugar wholesalerscontrolled by the Ministry, but nothing is known in the Board of Trade as to wholesalers&apos; profits.    Refiners. From statements made in the press and at the annual meeting of Messrs. Tate and Lyle,it appears that this firm refines approximately 30,000 tons of sugar per week, or nearly 1,600,000 tonsa year.  The  total annual consumption  in this  country is nearly 2,000,000 tons a year, so that theproduction of Messrs. Tate and Lyle is equal approximately to 80 per cent,  of consumption.    At the annual meeting of Messrs.  Tate and Lyle held on 6th December, 1929, Sir E. Tate said thatthe firms&apos; profits were considerably less than one-tenth of a penny per lb. on sugar produced.    According to a statement published in the &quot; Economist &quot; on 30th November, 1929, the firm&apos;s profits in the year ended 30th September,  1929, were  909,082  (before deducting   22,500 for debentureinterest) leaving net earnings of  886,552.4th March, 1930.

Claims for Compensation in respect of trades taken over by Import Boards ;  and                    . v    //. Working Capital required by such Bpards.,-,, .                        (Prepared in the Board of Trade in March, 1930.)    1.   It was the experience of the Royal Cornmission on Wheat Supplies &quot; that the relation between Graindifferent cereals was so intimate, and that the exclusion of one commodity reacted so quickly on the importers.inclusion of another, that the ultimate control of all cereals was unavoidable.&quot;  By the spring of 1917the Government had become responsible for importing wheat, maize, rice, barley, rye, oats, peas,beans and other pulse, flour, and every.kind of product of a cereal character and.all substitutes there-for.  (Cmd. 1544. para. 3.)  The establishment of an Import Board for wheat would thus involve theextension of operations to other cereals and their products and substitutes.    The imports of wheat into the United  Kingdom in the year  ended 31st December, 1929, were approximately 5,588,000 tons (value  58 million).  The total imports of grain and flour in  the sameyear amounted to 9,321,000 tons (value   96 million).    The Board of Trade possess no information as to the capital of firms engaged in  the importingtrades in grain and grain products.  An attempt must therefore be made to estimate net profits and tocapitalize them.    In  1925 the Royal Commission on Food  Prices found that precise information as to  profits ofwheat importers was almost unobtainable, but accepted the statements made to  them by witnessesthat a grain trader would regard a  margin of J to \ per cent, as satisfactory.  (Report, paras. 175-6.)This margin of profit is, however, in respect of brokerage only, and there is no information&apos; as to how much of it is net profit.  Nor is there any information as to the profits (and losses)  normally made bygrain importers by means of correct (and incorrect) anticipation.    An endeavour has been made  by the Inland Revenue to furnish average figures  for the profits of some 20  prominent grain importers (names furnished by the Board of Trade), but it has,been foundthat in respect of seven firms the Inland  Revenue possess  no returns, and in the case of eight firmsno figures are given for turnover.   The following is extracted from an Inland Revenue letter dated28th February, 1930:           &quot; In two cases where turnover is shown it seems clear that the figure relates only to gross      commission, fees etc., received and not to the value of the commodities sold.  These are there-      fore  of no use for your purpose.           Three cases, however, seem to give a figure for turnover  which is large enough to represent      the sales, though it may also include brokerage fees on other transactions not included in the      sales figure.  The cases show that the income tax profit was about\ per cent, in one case (years      1926 and  1927), about 3  per cent, and 1\ per cent, in the second case (years 1926 and 1927)      and  a large loss in  the third case (year 1926).  The total turnover in the three cases was about       13,000,000 (year 1926), and the profit less loss was about  5,000.           It is impossible to say whether the high rate of profit in the second case is a normal brokerage      profit or if it is due to the fact that the profit was obtained  partly from commission business      and  partly from dealing on own account.   I fear the net  result is that our information  is of      little assistance.&quot;    It  is clear that no reliable information  can be obtained as to  the profits in the grain importingtrade without a special inquiry by the Inland Revenue covering all or the majority of firms engagedin the trade.  If, however, it is assumed that the net profit on turnover is \ per cent, (a not uncommonrate of profit in other brokerage trades), a figure of  290,000 per annum is obtained on the total importsof wheat in 1929 ( 58 million).  The conjectural nature of this figure must be emphasised havingregard  to (1) the uncertainty as to the actual rate of net profit;  (2) the lack of information as to theproportion  of the import trade which passes through the hands of brokers and merchants (the bigmilling companies usually make their own purchases) ;  (3) the lack of information as to the extentto which the turnover of the trade is increased by re-sales to other brokers.    2.  The total value of the imports of other grain in 1929 was  31  million.  The same considerations Other grain.apply to this trade as to the trade in wheat.  If the net profit on turnover is at the rate of \ per cent.,a total figure  of  155,000 per annum for net profit is the result.

The Royal  Commission on Food Prices were informed in 1925 that, when  distributing direct Flour.to the  baker, flour importers aim at the remuneration  of Is. per sack,  but this was stated to be amaximum figure for gross profit.  In  1929 flour imports amounted to  3,881,000 sacks, and the net profitat the rate  of 6d. per sack would be say,   100,000.

Milling.          4. No information is available as to the total amount of capital engaged in the milling industry.            Information is available, however, as to the issued capital of four public companies operating in London,            Liverpool and  Swansea.   These companies have been chosen on the grounds (1) that they do not            possess, so far as is known, businesses abroad, and  (2) are not believed to have a large proportion of            watered capital.  It is undesirable to base any calculation on the three most important milling concerns            in the country because one (Messrs. Spillers) has large interests in Canada and other countries, the second            (Messrs. Ranks) is a private limited company, and its capital is alleged to have been watered, and the            third (the Co-operative Wholesale Society) does not distinguish capital employed in the milling industry            from capital otherwise employed.                The issued capital of the four companies whose  businesses have been taken amounts to  2,400,000,            and their combined milling capacity for wheat flour is 562 sacks per hour ( ^  4,270 per sack per hour).            In 1924 the total wheat flour milling capacity of Great  Britain and Ireland was approximately            6,250 sacks per hour.  The present total for Great Britain may be estimated at 5,600 sacks per hour.                The total estimated  capital employed in the wheat flour milling industry of Great Britain would            therefore  be  4,270 X 5,600 = approximately  25  million.                It should be pointed out,  however, that the above figure assumes that issued capital is still fully            represented by assets in spite of the losses which have been experienced in the last eight years in the            milling industry.                To the above figure must be added an allowance for the estimated capital employed in the milling            of grain other than wheat.   According to the  Census of Production, 1924, the values of the wheat            products  (meal, flour and  offals) amounted to   82 million, and the value  of other cereal products            amounted to  19 million.  If an estimate is based on this proportion, the capital employed in the grain            milling trades (other than wheat), may be put at  5,600,000.                  Conclusion                                          Milling (wheat  and other grains).                      Estimated capital employed............ 29,600,000.Baking.          5. A figure of  3,650,000 a year for total net  profit of the baking industry is mentioned in the            memorandum dated 4th  March, 1930. This figure would include co-operative profits.  The element            of risk in the baking trade is comparatively small, and an average net profit of between 5 and 6 per cent.            on turnover is quite usual. Further, a considerable amount of the capital employed is represented            by physical assets (bakeries, delivery vans, etc.).

The following is a list of the issued capital of the four British companies engaged in the Southimporters.

On the other hand, it does not own freezinworks in South America, whereas the  three other companies do.    The above four firms only do about 35 per cent, of the total import trade from  South America,the remainder being shared between three American companies (whose capital employed here is not known)  and one Argentine company.   For the above reasons, issued capital cannot be used as a basis for calculation of compensation.      Conclusion. If the estimated net profit ( 1,500,000)  given in the memorandum  of 4th March,          1930, is capitalized on the basis of 8  years&apos; purchase, the compensation figure is  12,750,000.          It should be noted that there is a considerable amount of capital locked up in the meat          works and other physical assets.    The above figures exclude profits made on the importation of live animals for  food and of pigproducts, as to which the Board of,Trade possess  no information.Meat            7. The records of the Ministry of Food show that in 1918 there were 1,681 meat wholesalers inwholesalers.   Great Britain.   The number has probably increased since that date, but the Board of Trade possess            no information which would enable an estimate to be made of the total net profits of meat wholesalers            or an estimate of the capital employed in these businesses.
(a) Sugar   refiners.    8. The estimate given in the memorandum of  4th March, for net profits of the retail trade was  Meat 7,650,000 per annum.                                  &apos;           &apos;                            retailers.           Conclusion.   The fixed assets in the retail meat trade are comparatively small  and it is      suggested that profits should be capitalized  oh  the basis of 9 years&apos; purchase.   The result is      a total  of  68,850,000.               Note.-The above figures include profits of co-operative societies, who claim to do           about 20 per cent, of the total retail trade of the country.    9. As stated in the  memorandum of 4th March (para. 19) it is not believed that any appreciable  Sugar.profit is taken by sugar retailers.    From  the statements made at the last two annual meetings of Messrs. Tate &amp; Lyle,  Limited,it  appears that  the company  refines about 30,000 tons  of sugar  per  week, which representapproximately 80 per cent, of  the estimated consumption in this country.    The  issued  capital of Messrs, Tate  &amp; Lyle,  Limited,  consists  of  1,100,000 in ,6  per cent.Preference and  3,312,000 in Ordinary shares, and in addition there are  500,000 of 41 per cent.Debentures. The present market prices are : Debentures 86, Preference 22s. 3d., Ordinary 34s., which gives a total market value for the Debentures and share  capital of approximately  7,284,000.           Conclusion.   On the assumptions (a) that Messrs.  Tate &amp; Lyle do the same proportion of      the  total  trade in glucose, molasses and allied trades as they do of the sugar refining trade,      viz., 80 per cent., and (6) that the capital employed by the remainder of the trade bears the      same relationship to its  turnover as that disclosed in the case of Messrs. Tate &amp; Lyle, it may      be estimated that the total capital employed in the sugar refining, glucose and allied trades      is between  9 million and  10 million.    The Board of Trade  possess no information regarding profits earned by  brokers.  The RoyalCommission on the Sugar Supply stated in their First Report that they allowed a brokerage of J percent, to the trade.  From the  size of the business done by refiners,  who mainly import their ownsugar, it would appear that the proportion of the home trade in the hands of brokers is not very large.    The Ministry of Food figures show  that in 1918 there were 6,503 sugar wholesalers controlled bythe Ministry, but nothing is known in the Board of Trade as  to the wholesalers&apos; profits.(6) Brokers.(c) Whole-   saleis.                                           &apos;  n.                                        :4f$M    10. The amount of working capital required by a grain and flour Import Board would depend  Grain andon the extent to which the Board would finance its own shipments or would resort to the banks.  The   our&quot;present practice of the grain trade is to rely very largely on banks and finance houses to which docu.-ments are made over in countries of origin.  Assuming that the Import Board would not, on the average,carry consignments for more than one month and a half, the Board would turn over stocks eight timesin the year.  If the banks and finance houses were prepared to finance ,90 per cent, of the turnovera working capital of  15  per cent, might  be sufficient, or say  1,800,000  on a turnover of  12 million per month and a half.  (Yearly imports of grain and flour =  96 million.)  These figures are, however,conjectural since the time for which stocks are held must vary continually with  price variations andthe extent of the banks&apos; participation in the business cannot be  known.    The above figure does not include any operations undertaken in regard to home-produced grain.    11. As in the case of the flour and grain importing trade, the present practice of meat importers is to  Meat.rely very largely on banks and finance houses to finance shipments.  Assuming that the Import board would not, on the average, carry consignments for more than a month and a half, the Board would turnover stocks eight times in the year.  If the banks and finance houses were prepared to finance 90 percent,  of the turnover a working capital of  25 per cent, (to include working capital of freezing works)would probably be sufficient,  or say  1,600,000 on a turnover  of  6,370,000 per month and  a half(yearly imports =  51 million for beef, veal, mutton and lamb).  This figure is also conjectural  as theextent.of the participation of the banks.in the business cannot be known, and so far as-frozen meatis concerned, the period for which stocks are held must  vary from time to time with price variations.    12. In Part I (para. 9 (a)) it has been stated that the present market value of  the shares of Messrs.  Sugar.Tate  &amp; Lyle, Ltd.,  is  approximately   7,284,000.  This figure would include  the working capitalnecessary for the carrying on of the hrm&apos;s business, which covers 80 per cent, of the refining in thiscountry, and possibly as large a proportion of the import  trade in unrefined sugar.  The value of theremaining 20 per cent, of the import  trade is  4,800,000 (1929 values). The working capital requiredby the Import Board to handle the 20  per cent, not dealt with by the refineries may be estimatedat  60,000 on the assumptions that the Board  would turn over stocks 12 times a year, that the banks would finance 90 per cent, of the turnover, and that a working capital of 15 per cent,  of the monthly turnover  would be sufficient.                                                                       BOARD OF TRADE.    5th March, 1930.
                                    APPENDIX  III.                               IMPORT BOARD  FOR SUGAR.          (Prepared in March, 1930, by the Treasury and Board of Customs and Excise.)    1. We have examined the proposal that an Import Board should be set up to control imports of sugar into this country with a view to assisting the West Indian and Mauritius producer to competesuccessfully with cheap Cuban and Javan sugar.   In the following observations we have assumed that,while it would be necessary for such a Board also to be the sole purchaser of the home sugar crop,it would not be necessary at this stage at any rate to take over the sugar refining industry in this country.    2. The proposal of the West Indian Sugar Commission is that Imperial sugar should be paid for ata fixed minimum rate based on reasonable economic costs of production ; the minimum rate suggestedby the Commission was about  15  per ton c.i.f.  for 960 sugar.  At the time when the Commissionreported this represented an increase of  3 per ton on the  market price.  Since the Commissionreported the market price has fallen and preferentials 96&quot;, which were then fetching about  12 per ton,are  now quoted at  about  11 10s. per ton.  The increase over  market price would thus be  3 10s.per ton.    3. The Commission contemplated that a single central authority would be established to buyand distribute the whole of the sugar consumed in Great Britain.  It would, however, be impossibleto distinguish between sugar imported for consumption in this country and sugar imported for sub-sequent export.  The enhanced price would accordingly have to be paid  on all imports of Imperialsugar.    4. The imports and home production of sugar in 1929 were :                                                               Tons.          Imported non-Empire sugar       ..     ..     ..   1,400,000 = 58 per cent.                                                     tons.          Imported Empire sugar     ..    ..     .. 710,000          Home-grown sugar    ..     . .    ..     .. 290,000                                                    -1,000,000 = 42 per cent.                                                            2,400,000For 1930 the home production is estimated at 375,000 tons.    5. If a minimum buying price of  15 per ton for Empire sugar were adopted the cost on currentfigures would be over  3J millions.  But an increased amount of Empire sugar would certainly be offered to this country, and on the assumption (which we accept) that the higher price would be paid forDominion as well as for Colonial sugar, and that similar terms would have to be granted to home-grownsugar, it is conceivable that not far short of two-thirds of our total supplies might eventually have tobe bought at the enhanced  price.    On the basis of the  current  quotation of  11 10s. per ton forpreferential  96D sugar the Buying Agency would have to recover an additional sum of approximately 6 millions from its selling prices, and this addition,  spread over the total supplies, would represent an increase in the retail price of about -28d. per lb. ( 2 12s. per ton).    6. It would, however, be necessary to take steps to  avoid prejudicing the sugar  export trade,e.g., by giving exporters a rebate corresponding to the amount they had paid for their sugar in excess of current world prices.  Exports of sugar and molasses in 1929 amounted to over 200,000 tons, and thecost of the rebate might therefore be about  600,000.  If this cost were also passed on  to the Britishconsumer the increase in the retail price would  represent, not -2Qd. per lb., but about -3\d.    It appears, therefore, that  an increase of \d. per lb.  in the retail price charged to  the consumermight not eventually suffice  to cover the extra  price falling on the trade in this country.    7. Our conclusion is accordingly that, if an exchequer subsidy is excluded, an Import Board couldguarantee a  price of  15 a ton c.i.f. for Empire sugar only by imposing an extra charge on the consumerin this country  exceeding  3   millions  on present  supplies, and rapidly increasing up to possibly 6 millions  a  year as additional Empire sugar was attracted here and the home-grown suppliesincreased.    Note. 1.  On the basis of a home consumption of 2,000,000 tons refined sugar an increase in the retail price charged to  the consumer of \d. a lb. would represent about  4i millions, \d. a lb. would represent about  9 millions.    2. Since this Memorandum was written the  price of preferentials 960 has fallen still further to about 9 15s. per ton.  On this basis the immediate cost of the Olivier proposal would be about  5f millions,and the ultimate cost possibly  8J millions per annum.
                                     APPENDIX  IV.Secret.        TREATY  OBLIGATIONS  WITH  REFERENCE  TO  TARIFFS,  PROHIBITIONS                            AND  BULK  PURCHASE SCHEMES.                            Memorandum by the Board of Trade.    It will perhaps be most convenient to consider the treaty obligations of the United kingdom with regard to tariffs, prohibitions and trade monopolies separately.    Tariffs. So far as bilateral treaties are concerned, His  Majesty&apos;s Government are at liberty toimpose any rate of duty which they think expedient on any article imported into this country, withthe one exception of currants, provided always that there is  no discrimination as between particularforeign countries.   By the Anglo-Greek Treaty of 1926, the duty on currants on importation into theUnited Kingdom is fixed at an amount not exceeding 2s.  per cwt.  The Treaty may be denouncedat any time, and in that case it ceases to have effect twelve months from  the date of  denunciation.    The only other obligation with regard to the rates of import duty which can be levied generally on particular articles arises from the Commercial Convention (the Tariff Truce Convention)  recently concluded at Geneva.   This Convention has not yet been ratified and is therefore not in force.  If it comes into force this country will be under an obligation not to increase protective duties or to imposenew protective duties, as compared  with the position on 24th March, 1930, during the period of theConvention.  Fiscal duties on the other hand may be increased, or new fiscal duties imposed without previous notice, and  without  any  obligation to negotiate  with other countries for the accord ofcompensating advantages.  Any State injured by such fiscal duties may, however, denounce the Con-vention.  Fiscal duties are not expressly denned in the Convention, but the High Contracting parties agree that &quot; they do not give a wide interpretation &quot; to the terms and &quot; that in particular they willnot apply this term to duties which have as their object the protection  of national production againstforeign countries.&quot;  The Convention terminates on the  1st April, 1931, unless it is extended.  after that date it may be prolonged by successive periods of six months  if no State Party to it announcesits intention to withdraw.    Although  these two instruments are the only ones which prevent the imposition of duties  on particular commodities, practically all commercial  treaties  concluded by this country would precludeHis Majesty&apos;s Government from imposing differential duties on the goods of any particular country.The basis of our commercial policy with regard to tariffs  is that  our  goods shall receive in foreigncountries, and the goods of foreign countries shall receive in this country treatment at least as favour-able as  that accorded to the like goods of any other foreign country.   Any protection of the home market must therefore be protection against all foreign goods and not against the goods of any particularforeign country or  countries.    On the other hand, there is  nothing in any existing commercial treaty which precludes or limitsin any way the accord of preferential treatment to goods originating in any part of the Empire.    Prohibitions. There are two bilateral treaties and one International Convention  which  limit the freedom of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the  imposition of prohibition or restrictions upon theimportation of goods into this country.    Here again it is important to remember that though these instruments apply between this countryand very few other countries, this country is still under an obligation by its commercial treaties withpractically every other important commercial country to accord to the  goods of those countries treat-ment at least as favourable in this matter as is accorded to any other foreign country. The obligationtowards Germany therefore involves a similar obligation towards all other countries who have most-favoured-nation rights in this country in the matter of prohibitions.    The Anglo-German Treaty of 1924 states (Article 10) :           &quot; Trade and traffic between the territories of the  two Contracting Parties shall, as far as      possible, not be impeded by any kind of import or export prohibitions or restrictions &quot; ;and paragraph  (3) of the Protocol to that Treaty provides :           &quot; Both Contracting Parties agree to remove at  the earliest  possible opportunity,  but not      later than six months from the coming into force  of  the  Treaty  signed this day, all forms of      prohibition or restriction of importation or exportation, except in those special cases mentioned      in Article 10 of the Treaty, or in such other special cases as may be notified by either Party      to the other Party before the ratification of the Treaty.&quot;    The exceptions mentioned in this paragraph of the Protocol and in Article 10 of the Treaty arethe usual exceptions which are dealt with later in this memorandum.    The position under the Anglo-German Treaty therefore is that no new prohibitions or restrictions,except of the special kinds dealt with later, may be imposed against German goods during the periodof the validity of the  Treaty and, by the operation of the most-favoured-nation provisions  of othertreaties, this immunity  is enjoyed by most  countries with which this country has treaty relations.    The Treaty may be denounced at any time, and in that case will come to an end twelve months from the date of denunciation.    In this  connection it is, however, to be observed that by virtue of Article 1 of the CommercialConvention above referred to, if it is ratified, the parties agree not to denounce  any bilateral commercial treaty in force between themselves before 1st April next.                -,.(C 1229)F
     The Anglo-Persian Tariff Autonomy Treaty, which has only recently been ratified, but which hasbeen provisionally in operation since May, 1928, contains this provision in Article 4 :            &quot; His Britannic Majesty,  so far as concerns his territories to which this Treaty applies,       and His Majesty the Shah of Persia, being each desirous of encouraging liberty of commerce       and of avoiding the hindrance of their mutual commercial relations by prohibitions or restrictions       on imports and exports, agree that they will not introduce any restrictive or prohibitive measures       against products of the territories of the other with the exception of the following classes&apos; of       prohibitions and restrictions . .  .  .&quot;           (Here follows a list of exceptional classes identical with that contained in the International       Convention referred to below.)The last paragraph of the same article provides :            &quot; Nevertheless, it is agreed between the two High Contracting Parties that the provisions       of this Article shall not be involved in  regard to any prohibition or restriction on importation       or exportation which is not contrary to the provisions of the International Convention for the       Abolition of Prohibitions and Restrictions. ...&quot;     This Treaty remains in force until 10th May, 1936.     The other instrument is the International Convention for the Abolition of Import and ExportProhibitions.  This Convention  is  in force until 30th June,  1931, only as regards  the followingcountries :                                   Great Britain,                                  United States,                                  Japan,                                  The Netherlands.                                  Portugal,                                  Sweden,                                  Denmark.     The Parties to this Convention &quot; undertake to abolish within the period of six months from the dateof the coming into force of the present Convention, in so far as the respective territories of each of the mare concerned, all import and export prohibitions or restrictions, and not thereafter to impose any suchprohibitions or restrictions.&quot;   The Convention, however, sets out a list of classes of import and exportprohibitions which are not to be regarded as prohibited by the Convention.  These relate generally toprohibitions and restrictions relating to public security, traffic in arms, protection of public health andthe health of animals and plants against disease, etc., and to two other categories which are of particular interest in connection with this memorandum.  They are  :           &quot; 7. Prohibitions or restrictions designed to extend to foreign products the regime established       within the country in respect of the production of. trade in, and transport and consumption of       native products of the same kind.          &quot; 8. Prohibitions or restrictions applied to products which, as regards production or trade.       are or may in future be subject within the country to  State monopoly or to monopolies exercised       under State control.&quot;     The corresponding provision in the Anglo-Persian Tariff Autonomy Treaty is (as above indicated)in identical  terms with these two paragraphs.   The exceptions were, in fact, taken bodily from theConvention.     In the case of the German Treaty the corresponding provision reads :           &quot; (e) For the purpose of extending to foreign goods prohibitions and restrictions which are       or may hereafter be imposed by internal legislation upon the production, sale, consumption or       forwarding within the territories of the Party concerned of goods of the same kind produced       within those territories, including, in particular, goods which are the subject of a State monopoly       or similar arrangement.&quot;    Apart from these generally accepted classes of prohibition the International Convention allowed ofthe scheduling by particular countries of particular exceptions. The United  Kingdom prohibition ofdyestuffs,  etc., was scheduled under this provision.  Elsewhere in the Convention provisions  were included which allowed of the maintenance of certain prohibitions in  force  for the safeguarding ofnational and the prohibition of foreign made goods.     Bulk Purchase. It will be seen from the considerations set forth above  that there is nothing inthe treaties or international conventions to which His Majesty is a party which would  prevent theestablishment in this country of monopolies for the purchase  of, and trade in, any commodity, so long asthe monopoly extended not only to imported goods but also to home produced goods of the same kind.It would, however, not be possible under treaty obligations as they at present stand to establish asystem of compulsory  purchase of imported commodities while leaving the corresponding home produced article free of restriction,  because it would be impossible to do so without instituting some system of prohibition or of restriction upon the importation of the commodity in question.     Denunciation. The instrument with the longest period of validity still to  run is the Anglo-PersianTariff  Autonomy Treaty, which remains in force without  the possibility of denunciation until the10th May, 1936.  The Anglo-German Treaty remains in force for twelve months after denunciation,and  the Prohibitions Convention is binding upon this country until June 30th, 1931.  The positionafter that date depends on a number of considerations, which it is scarcely necessary to  enumerate :it is perhaps enough to say that it is unlikely that the United Kingdom will be bound by the Conventionafter that date if we desire to be free of our obligations under it.     It is difficult to forecast the effect upon the trade in this  country of the denunciation of our treatiesfor the purpose of placing prohibitions or  restrictions upon the  importation of goods from othercountries or for the purpose of imposing differential duties against the goods  of particular countries
The whole effort of our treaty-making policy has been directed towards securing for British goods thebest competitive position which is possible in other countries as against the goods of any other foreign country.  The most-favoured-nation provisions of our treaties secure that in customs matters ourgoods shall not be treated worse than the goods of other countries, and although this provision doesnot in general help British goods to compete with home produced goods, it does secure them  againstcompetition on preferential terms from the goods of other countries.  This right cannot but be ofinestimable value to the goods of any country, which, like the United Kingdom, depends for its veryexistence  on its exports.   It has in the past happened and there are a few countries with which weare in the same position  to-day that  friendly  commercial relations have existed in the absence of atreaty giving specific rights  to British goods, but it can scarcely be conceived that if our rights weregiven up for the specific purpose of imposing prohibitions or differential duties on imports from othercountries  that those countries would refrain from taking energetic steps to penalise British goods,and the effect on our trade would almost certainly be disastrous to an extent out of all proportion toany benefits which might accrue from a restrictive policy in this country.    In the particular case of Germany, exports of British goods in 1928 were about   41,000,000 in value, and of this  some  3f million was coal.    With regard to the clauses in the Anglo-German Treaty limiting our right to impose prohibitions,and the Prohibitions  Convention,  which represented an effort on our part to impose on commercialcountries generally the same limitation of the right to impose prohibitions as we had ourselves  already undertaken in our treaty with Germany, it must be borne in mind that this country was one of thefirst and most energetic protagonists in the attempt to get rid of the disastrous effects of the wholesaleprohibitions and restrictions which were imposed in Europe immediately after the war.    It must also be remembered that the difficulties which U.K. export trade had to face when thisprohibition policy  was in full swing were of a nature far more difficult to combat than those resultingfrom high customs tariffs, owing to the much  greater uncertainty resulting from the adminstrationof a system of prohibitions and licences as compared with the definitely ascertainable obstacles resultingfrom a fixed tariff of  customs duties.
