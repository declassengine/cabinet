Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.                 At  the Preliminary Conference on concerted Economic           Aotion,  held  at Geneva in February and March last, it           was deoided that each participating country should           send to  the Secretariat of the League of Nations, before           let September next,  answers to the following questionnaire,           with a view to  these answers being considered as a basis           for the  further negotiations which are to take place in           regard to the reduotion of tariffs and other obstaoles to           trade:-                                       A.               (a) In what  agricultural products is there over-                    production in each country?               (b) What are the normal outlets for these products?               (o) What practical means can be employed to ensure                    the disposal and distribution of surplus pro-                    duotion in the normal markets and in other                    countries  with an insufficient production?                                       B.               What  practical  means can be employed to facilitate,                the  disposal of manufactured products, particularly                in the direction of increasing the extent to which                it is possible for consuming countries to purohase                them?                                       C.               In particular,  what are, in the case of the products                mentioned in A and B above, the Customs and                administrative measures which seem likely to promote                the  extension  of markets and the improvement of                international  trade?                (In  order to facilitate the preparation of a                practical programme of preliminary negotiations it is                desirable that,  in the first instance, so far as                tariffs are concerned, mention should only be made in                detail of those modifications to which the most                importance  is  attached).
                                                      21) 0                                D.   What practical means can he employed to ensure the  movement    of European raw materials amongst the different  countries    under more satisfactory conditions and their better    utilisation?     On the basis cf the replies received the economic organisation of the League will formulate proposals, whichare to be submitted for the examination of the Governmentsconcerned.   When the observations of the Governments  have  &apos;been reoeived, the League Oeunoil will draw up the subsequentprocedure for the negotiations,     I attach a draft reply to the above questionnaire whiohhas been prepared in informal consultation between theBoard of Trade and the Customs.   It will be noted that  inthis draft, particular emphasis is laid on the necessity of taking action to reduce tariffs on selected groups of commodities.     All that I am now asking for is the authority of  myoolleagues to make proposals generally on the lines  suggested,subjeot to the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer andto any modifications that he may require.

           PROTOCOL &quot;REGARDING- FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS.           Draft reply to Questionnaire annexed to                  Article 1. (Third Revise).Question A.     In as much as the United Kingdom has no surplusof agricultural products to export His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom would prefer to await the views of other countries in regard to these Questions.At the same time, as the United Kingdom is an importingcountry, His Majesty&apos;s Government are naturally interestedin many aspects of the problem.Question B.     As regards the disposal of manufactured products,His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to emphasise the primary importance, in their opinion, among the means for bringing about this object, of reducing Customs tariffsto a moderate level.   In this connection they wouldrecall the view expressed by the World Economic conference that tariffs &quot;are at present one of the chief barriersto trade&quot;.   The Oonference, it will be remembered,  drewspecial attention to the increases made in most countries,since before the war,  of the duties on manufactured articles, and their diagnosis of the causes  of this tendency appears sufficiently noteworthy to be recalledhere.   After referring to the factor of currencydepreciation - a complicating element which has now happilybeen almost entirely removed - the Report of the Conferenceproceeds: -                  &quot;A second reason for the present  tariff             situation both in Europe and elsewhere is the             desire of nations to keep existing or  recently             established industries in being, bjr means of             tariffs,  on a scale which they would not other-             wise be able to maintain.   These industries             have grown to their present extent in  some             cases as a result of abnormal expansion             during the war, in others as a result  of the                            -3-
 desire of certain nations  to attain a  degree of economic independence which is not  justified by their slender resources, and again  in  others with a view to providing employment for surplus labour for which certain former  outlets are at present closed.      This increase in productive capacity has often outrun the capacity  of the country to absorb the  products either as regards its  material needs or its purchasing power.   The result has been either that  the  plant left idle has-overweighted the  costs of production, particularly when borrowed caoital is involved, or that, in order to utilise the whole plant, and to  give some return to the capital employed, it has been necessary to turn to the foreign mamcet and so to intensify international competition.      The desire  to deal with the problem of excessive industrial capacity has usually led to an attempt to reserve the home market for home production by means of tariff barriers erected with a  view  to creating an independent national economy capable  of producing,  under the protection of the  tariff wall, an increa.se of invested wealth and  a more satisfactory return for the work of the  nation.   This effort to attain self- sufficiency  cannot hope to  succeed unless it is justified by  the  size,  natural resources,  economic advantages and geographical situation of a country. There are very few countries in the world which can  hope  to attain it.    The artificial increase of plant which  is only partly  employed has meant not only uneconomical and costly production,  but also a wasteful use of the world&apos;s  reduced capital resources.    It has thus been  one of the  causes which has maintained an abnormally high rate of interest  in recent years.    It should be  added that, so  long as unduly high tariffs are  maintained, this uneconomic use of  capital continues  and creates an increasing number of vested interests  which resist a  return to a sounder policy.&quot;     His Majesty&apos;s Government  would further add that, while they recognise that Customs tariffs  are not the only form of obstacle to  trade which falls to be considered in this connection,  and  that much importance also attaches  to such  practices as fall within the generic description of &quot;IndirectProtectionism,&quot; nevertheless,  in  their view the cardinal influence is that exercised by Customs tariffs,  and any attempt to deal with the  other factors above mentioned, while leaving unsolved the question of
Customs tariffs, would amount to leaving the larger part ofthe problem untouched.  Moreover, any success that might be attained in these other directions could at any time benullified by further increases of Customs duties.Question C.     As regards practical methods cy which the reductionof Customs tariffs could be brought about, His majesty&apos;sGovernment are anxious to obtain a reduction of all dutiesother than fiscal duties at the earliest possible date.They recognise, however, that, in order to keep the problemwithin manageable limits, it may be necessary that thenegotiations should proceed by stages, a few groups cfcommodities being dealt with at each stage.  The orderin :?hich such groups of commodities are selected forconsideration might, His Jiajesty&apos;&apos;s Government suggest, followgenerally their relative magnitude and importance in international trade.  Thus, in the first place, some suchgroups as t extile fabrics and machinery might be selected.His majestyla Government accordingly suggest for thefirst negotiations these two groups, namely (1) textilefabrics and (2) machinery.     As regards the method by which the reduction of tariffs in relation to these two groups 3hould be broughtabout, His :iajesty&apos;s Government would tentatively suggestsome such procedure as is outlined below:-     (i) Each Government participating in the negotiations should state the total customs revenue which it derived,in the fiscal year 1929 (or that fiscal year of whichthe major portion fell within tho calendar year 1929),from its import duties (other than fiscal duties) upon thegoods comprised within each of the groups under consideration.     (ii) Prom each of these totals there would, in the
 first place be deducted an amount equivalent  to  an agreed percentage  (which should not  exceed say  5$) of the value  as shown in the Trade Statistics of the country  concerned, of the goods falling within the particular group  in  question,  imported during the  above-mentioned fisoal year.      (lii)  Each State should  undertake so  to  reduce its duties on the commodities comprised  within the  group in question that on the basis of the importations of 1929,  the balance of revenue as  arrived at in (ii)  would be diminished by an agreed percentage.    Such reduction  should be calculated upon the rates of Customs  duty which are  applicable, under either  the autonomous  or the Conventional Tariff, to  goods  originating in countries entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment.      (iv) These reductions should be spread with proportional equivalence over  all the articles within the  group.  Exception might possibly be made of articles on which the  rate of duty already falls below the agreed percentage  of  tolerance referred to  in paragraph (ii)  above, and  as it may  also be necessary in certain other cases to admit  special exceptions  to the general principle&apos;;  each State should  determine for itself what reductions  of individual duties  would be required,  observing the principle,  as far as possible.    It would, at a  later date  to be  fixed,  send to  the  Secretary General  of the League for communication to  the other participant States,  an explanatory  statement showing, with all necessary statistical details, how the  re&amp;uotion of  particular duties  has been arranged.      (v)  The  reduced duties thus  arrived  at  should, it is suggested, be  scheduled  in a multilateral Convention,subjeot to their approval by the Conference,  it  being understood thatob3eation could be raised  if there was any wide departure fromthe principal of  equivalence of reductions laid down in (iv).By this Convention the participating States would agree to seourethe enforcement of the reduced duties.                            -S**
   (vi) At the first Conference  an agreement should Toe  reachedto the effeat that the work of similarly dealing with other groups (to ba specified) of commodities in a determined order should be proceeded with forthwith.   Subsequent Conferencesshould be called at agreed intervals.     The groups suggested for first consideration relate, itwill bo seen, to manufactured products,   While Hia Majesty&apos;sGovernment particularly emphasise the importance of reducingthe duties on these goods, they  see at the same time an advantage in the holding, simultaneously or in oloae succession,of Conferences or sub-conferences, of which one would deal withgroups of manufactured products, while another would deal witha selected group or groups of products of agriculture, stockraising, fisheries, and their derivatives.     His Majesty1s Government are not uninterosted in theduties on foodstuffs.   The more the duties on these are raised in Europe, the greater becomes the danger of disturbance of themarket In the United Kingdom by the dumping of surpluses.     His Majesty1 s Government v^ish to make it clear that, Inputting forward the above suggestions regarding Tariffs, theydo not by any means intend to rule out other possible proposals with a view to promoting the extension of markets and theimprovement of international trade, but they would once moreemphasize that, failing a resolute and effective attempt todeal with the problem of excessive and unstable tariffs, otherremedial measures can, in their opinion, only have a limitedeffect.Question Ds     with regard to this question His iEa.jesty&apos;e Government                        &quot;v.would prefer to await the views of other Governments.
