Copy No._---CABINET.LP.282 Ac (30)                Statement on Agricultural Policy,    1.       In view of the depression which exists  in certain branches        of the agricultural industry, and the urgent need for reform in        methods both of marketing and production in  order to take        advantage of our valuable home market, the Government have given        anxious consideration to the agricultural problem, with especial        regard to the desirability of increasing employment on the land        with good standards of living, recognising that this can only be        assured through prospority in the industry.t  I. 2.  Holdings for small Cultivators,             Proposals will be submitted for making  land more freely        available for small cultivators and affording them adequate        security of tenure.             Local Authorities will be stimulated to meet the large and        unsatisfied demand for small holdings, cottage holdings and        allotments.   In addition, the Minister of Agriculture will be        given powers to acquire and manage land for  these purposes, so        as to supplement but in no way to supplant Local Authorities        that are active.   Powers to provide cottage holdings will be        extended to County Borough Councils and these holdings will be        made available for letting as well as  sale and for a wider class        of applicant.        Unemployment Scheme.             A scheme will be undertaken whereby a contribution may be        made to the mitigation of unemployment by the creation of a       . special class of allotments and of market garden and poultry        holdings up to 5 acres for suitable unemployed workers.
                                                            2.   3.  Large-Scalc  Farralng  and  Demonstration  Farag.          An Agricultural Land Utilisation  Corporation will bs      established  to  conduct,  on  the one  hand,  large-scale farming,      managed on business  principles,  with the  utmost possible      application  of  improved  methods  and the best machinery, with      the  particular  object of affording  to  agriculturists a practical      training  in  business management; and on the other hand,      additional Demonstration Farms of various types in different      parts of  the  country, designed to secure  the quicker and more      general adoption of  every agricultural improvement,   4,  bootland.          In Scotland,  the Department of Agriculture will mako every      effort  to  increase the number of small holdings available.  At      the  same  time investigations will be set  on foot for Improving      certain large tracts of  barren and  moss land and for reclamation      works.II.5.  Cereals.          The  critical  position  of cereal fanners demands the earliest      possible  attention.   The question of the  situation of  this  class      of agriculturists  in the different  parts  of the Empire will be      discussed at the forthcoming Imperial  Conference with,  special      reference to  Bulk  Purchase  and Import  Boards.  In vie i. of this,      and  of  the possibility that the  decisions of the Conference on      this matter  in ay materially  change the  practical problem of      dealing with cereal  farming, the Government is not in  a position      at present to formulate  comprehensive  proposals for this part of      the  agricultural situation  beyond the  plans outlined in this      statement for improved methods of cultivation, the better      organisation and marketing  of produoe, eduoation and research,      and  improved credit  facilities.  But as soon as the decisions      of the  Imperial Conference  are known, the  Government will      undertake  -whatever1 pra3tical steps  way be required to put cereal      growing in this country  on  an economic foundation.

  Agricultural Marketing Bill.       It is an urgent necessity to give our home producers  opportunities of orderly and  better marketing in our industrial  market.       A Bill ia being introduced forthwith, for purposes of criticism.  and comment,which offers certain powers to large-scale commodity  organisations initiated by producers themselves for the marketing  of home-produced agricultural products and protects such  organisations from the disruptive aotion of minorities.  There are  precedents for legislation of a similar kind in overseas parts of  the Empire.       The Bill contemplates organisations of two distinct-typos,  though combinations of both are possible.   First, there is the  older and better-known pool type which is  well adapted for products  in respect of which we are largely self-supporting, and of which  the market may be disturbed by reourring surpluses.  The Bill also  provides for organisations of the regulatory type which are  concerned more with the craft of marketing than with the physical  control and handling of the product, and which, after the manner  of a board of directors,  would formulate a coherent marketing  policy for the home product and carry it into effect.       Financial assistance by  way of both long and short term loans  will be available for these commodity marketing boards.       Care has been taken to provide safeguards for the groat body  of consumers  and for other affected interests.  Abattoirs.       The erection of publicly-owned abattoirs by Local Authorities  for the centralised slaughtering of livestock will be encouraged.rt III.  Education and Research.       The development of agricultural education will also form  an important  part of our policy.  An Agricultural Research Council  is being  constituted -to secure improved co-ordination and  extension of  agricultural research throughout the United Kingdom.  In view of the great losses incurred through disease, among the  first subjects to reoeive attention will be contagious abortion,  tuberculosis, and swine fever.
    9,  Scrub Bulls.       -------            Legislation will be introduced to regulate the use and       import of bulls, with a view to improving the  standard of our       livestock.   10*  Agricultural  Credit.            Arrangements  are under consideration for  the extension       of the Agricultural Credits Act, 19P8, to Scotland._IV.11. The Agricultural Worker.            Apart from the increased provision for access to land for       their own cultivation that the policy affords  to suitable workers,       it is important that agricultural workers should share In any       added prosperity which may accrue to the industry, and the working       of the existing machinery for regulating wages will be carefully       watched with,  this  object In view.   12.  Housing.            The present Housing Bill contains provisions which should       mitigate the  evil  of the tied cottage, to which we attach great       importance, and it  is the intention of the Government to take       special steps to stimulate the provision of Improved housing in       rural areas under  the powers therein provided.    Further, indnal   connection with the Rent Restriction Act, a Committee is some- unfedr considering the special position of the &quot;tied  cottage&quot;, with a^  thisfan     view to providing  a remedy against any unfair  use of this system.       Cpncluslon.                                                        j            The Government is convinced that by a sustained and well       directed effort designed to evoke the co-operation of the industry I       itself it should be possible to arrest the decline of employment                                                                          I       on the land and to foster, by taking advantage of modern develop-       ments and facilities, specialised and improved methods of       production which should result in a great increase in our home-       produced food supplies and bring back prosperity to our count ry-       side.    We believe that our proposals will have the effeot of                              -                                                                          1
inspiring in all sections of the farming community thatconfidence which is so essential to its progress and welfare,and will promote the sound development of our greatagricultural industry.try of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries.  10,  Whitehall Place,          S.W.I.  31st July,  1930.
