(THIS DOCTTMBHT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BF..ITIHNTO majesty&apos;s GOYERNMTiNT) jf                                                        - -----SECRET.                                           COPY NO.  -  3 &amp;CoP. 297(30).                           CABINET.            C o- or-*d-.nat I on of London Pas songejt^Trvirup ort.              Memorandum by the Minis tor of ^rausport,         After consideration of my memorandum CP. 227(30), theCabinet at their meeting on the 30th July authorised me to commencenegotiations with the various bodies concerned as soon  as I was ready to do so, but warned me that they could&apos;not commit themselvesto a Government Bill next Session and that their approval of theopening of negotiations mu3t not involve that responsibility in anyway.         Sir TTilliam McLintock*s investigations are not yet quitecomplete, but he has made considerable progress with his inquiry into the financial aspects of co-ordination and after considering a draft of some provisional proposals which he has made to me, I am   1hopeful that a scheme along the lines of that adumbrated in the                                                                      report of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on London Traffic CP. 305(2)can be secured.                                                                      I         The scheme would provide for the appointment by the Minister 1of Transport of a new public traffic authority with a small Board of  1Management which would acquire by an exchange of stocks the assets of the passenger transport undertakings local to the London area,whether municipally or privately owned, and itself manage end  operate Ithe consolidated services for the future.   The suburban lines of the 1four Amalgamated Railway Companies vrould not be taken over, but comespecial arrangements will be necessary to secure proper co-ordination 1with their services by rail and possibly also with regard to their powers to run road services in the outer area.   There  are, of course 1a number of special problems of a complex nature, but there is noreason to suppose that they need prove either individually orcollectively incapable of a satisfactory solution.
                            . 2 .                       358-JW1         In general the proposals which Sir William McLintockwill be able to submit confirm the general plan upon which Ishould desire to proceed and, in the light of his advice,  Ithink it should be possible to secure a scheme of finance  whichwould be fair to the interests concerned and leave the TrafficAuthority in a sound position.   We must be prepared to applycompulsion, but I hopo, and I should much prefer, to proceed,, sofar as possible, by negotiation with a view to incorporating theterms of settlement in the Bill itself.   If negotiations  areopened Immediately after the holidays, it should be possible,given good-will on the part of those with whom we negotiate, to embody the scheme in a Bill for introduction at Easter.   whether we shall in fact be able to include in the Bill the price  to bepaid to tho existing owners must, of course, depend on themeasure of agreement which is reached in the negotiations, but inthe event of the parties being unable to come to terms, provisionfor their settlement by some form of arbitration could be  made.         It will be remembered that my statement of December lastindicated that the Traffic Authority should not require thesupport of public funds or public credit.         The scheme which Is being worked out by Sir WilliamMcLintock accordingly does not provide for any Treasury guarantee of the new authority&apos;s stocks, except in so far as is necessaryto continue existing guarantees given under the Trade FacilitiesAct in respect of certain of the railway debentures.   In  theabsence of any such guarantee, there will bo a strong demand onthe part of those who will be required to take the new stocks  in exhange for their existing securities for some voice in themanagement of the new undertaking.   The question whether  thisshould be conceded (and, If so, to what extent and in what manner)is important and will require early decision.
                         - 3 -         I propose to proceed accordingly under the terms of myexisting authority, but while I shall, of course, he careful not to commit the Government to a date for the introduction ofa Bill, I feel that my position would be greatly strengthened ifI were able to intimate to the parties with whom I am going to initiate discussions, that the Government is fully resolved tointroduce legislation on the subject at the earliest possible date.   Any appearance of indecision on our part must inevitablyreact against us as negotiators and encourage obstructivetactics on the other side of the table.         It is clear from private conversations that those with whom we shall have to negotiate would strongly deprecate,  forobvious reasons, any prolonged delays in negotiations or anyinterval between the conclusion of negotiations and theintroduction of a Bill.   It would be impossible to keep theterms secret, and various embarrassments would arise.   Asatisfactory negotiation would, indeed, hardly be possibleunless the parties were assured that any agreement into whichthey entered would be forthwith presented to Parliament for confirmation.   I cannot, therefore, well pursue negotiationsbeyond their most preliminary stages unless we are prepared,at a comparatively early date, to get statutory sanction forthem if they are successful.         In the light of the progress made and the urgency ofthe problem, which is growing greater as new traffic problemsare created almost daily (e.g. the increase of motor coachtraffic in Central London), I am led strongly to urge theimportance of including in the King&apos;s Speech an indication oflegislation on this  subject next Session.                                     (Intld.) H.M.Oth September, 1930.
