THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1930.SECRET.                                                     Copy  No.   36CP. 290 (30).                                 CABINET.Imperial Conference,  1930.REPRESENTATION OF  THE  UNITED KINGDOM.         MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR THE COLONIES.    I  HAVE been  giving  further  thought to the  decision of  the  Cabinet onWednesday, the 23rd July (Cabinet Paper 44 (30) ), and I feel that I must troublemy colleagues with some further observations as regards the position to be occupiedby the Secretary of State for the Colonies at the forthcoming Imperial Conference.    I cannot help thinking that, in view of  the large  and ever-growing importanceof the Colonies,  Protectorates and Mandated Territories as a constituent part ofthe Empire, it would give a better appearance if the Secretary of State  responsiblefor them sat as a full member of the United Kingdom  delegation at the Conference,that is, &quot; For political and general questions &quot; as well  as &quot; For economic questions.&quot;His position, if this  were agreed, would be the same as that of the other Ministersforming the United Kingdom delegation; and I do not anticipate that any objectionwould, or indeed could properly, be raised by the Dominions to the adoption of this form of representation for the Colonies, &amp;c.    A point which has some bearing on this subject is that one of the reasons whythe  &quot; Colonial  Office  Conference&quot;   was  so  entitled,  rather  than   &quot; ColonialConference,&quot; was that it was felt that the Colonies, &amp;c, as part of the Empire, hadan obvious claim to representation at an Imperial Conference, and that there was accordingly no place for a separate &quot; Colonial Conference,&quot; any more than therewould be for a separate &quot; Dominions Conference.&quot;    I  feel  strongly (though  my colleagues will appreciate that, as I am  personallyaffected, it is a difficult matter for me to press) that the legitimate claims of theColonies, &amp;c, would  not be satisfied by the previous arrangement; any decision which gave the Colonies, &amp;e, any lower degree of representation than that indicated above would, so it seems to me, not only be questioned in Parliament here, but be resentedby responsible opinion throughout the non-self-governing dependencies  and  provedetrimental to the good feeling between them and this country.                                                                          P.    Colonial Office,  August 22, 1930.[21577]\
