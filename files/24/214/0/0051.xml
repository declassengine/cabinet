TiilS DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT.                   Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1930.SECRET.                                                      Qqpy  No.     ^3CP. 299 (30).                                 CABINET.Imperial Conference,  1930, Procedure.       MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS.    I HAVE given to my colleagues in CP. 298 (30) a brief outline of the agenda for the Conference.  The present memorandum deals with the procedure which we propose to suggest for the discussion at the forthcoming Imperial Conference of the many and various subjects included in the agenda  for the Conference.    2.  A statement is attached (Appendix A) showing in general how the various items of the agenda might be dealt with, if the Conference approves.  It will be seenthat these proposals involve four different methods of discussion :     (1)  Plenary meetings of the Conference.    (2)  Meetings of  Heads of Delegations (for important  political questions).    (3)  Meetings  of  the   Conference in  Committee  (for  important   economic           questions*).    (4)  Special Committees dealing with particular subjects.    3.   As regards (4), it will be observed that it  is proposed that, on  the politicalside, there should be     (a)  a political and legal Committee (with special Sub-Committees dealing with &apos;           the questions of nationality, &apos;prize law and  the discipline  of  armed           forces);    (b) a Committee dealing with arbitration and disarmament questions;    (c) Sub-Committees  for  the consideration of  particular  subjects  (mandate           questions, New Hebrides, Polar questions and War Graves).    4.   On the economic side, it is proposed that there should be a General EconomicCommittee  (which could refer individual subjects to special Sub-Committees) and separate Committees dealing with questions of Merchant Shipping Legislation (fromthe technical aspect), Bulk Purchases, Aviation,  Cables  and Wireless,  &amp;c,  and oversea Settlement.    5.   As  to personnel, it is  proposed in due course to circulate to all  members ofthe Conference a  complete list of representatives, advisers  and secretaries.  A list,which has been prepared as regards the United Kingdom, is attached (Appendix B).Similar  lists with regard  to  Dominion  delegations will be prepared  as soon asparticulars are available.    6.   The list of United Kingdom delegates has been drawn up in accordance with cabinet Conclusion 44 (30),  conclusion  8,  though on this I would invite  reference tothe memorandum recently  circulated by the Secretary of  State  for the Colonies(CP. 290 (30)).   The chief  United Kingdom advisers only are mentioned, but  it is realised that many other Departments are  interested and  will be called upon toadvise on particular subjects.   Hence it is suggested that each United  KingdomDepartment which is in any way concerned with the work of the Conference should nominate a single officer to whom the Secretariat could refer on matters  requiring a   * N.B. It may be necessary to reserve certain economic questions for discussions between Heads of delegations.      [21669]                                                          a(MHMBMflKttnnM
decision at very short notice, such as attendance of departmental representatives at meetings, preparation of information, &amp;c.  In the absence of a special nomination,the Secretariat will approach the Private Secretary to the Minister.    7.  The question of United Kingdom representation on Committees can hardly be settled at the moment.  In some cases, e.g., the Committees on Arbitration and disarment  questions  and Bulk Purchases, Ministerial representation would be essential.    In other  cases,  the representation  may be either  Ministerial ordepartmental.  The case of the General  Economic Committee, however, calls forspecial arrangements in view of the variety of the subjects which are likely to fall within its scope.  The most suitable course in the case of this Committee would  seemto be that  there should  be a panel of United  Kingdom representatives,  including representatives of every Department concerned, and that particular members of thispanel should attend particular meetings of the Committee according  to the subjectunder discussion.  It would accordingly be convenient if all Departments concernedwith matters  likely to  fall within the  scope of the General Economic  Committeewould notify the Secretary of the Conference of the officers whom they would  wishto nominate to this panel.
