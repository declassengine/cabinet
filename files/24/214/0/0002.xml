REPORT.                                  FOREWORD.    We understand that the necessity for simplifying and speeding up the existing machinery for political control in Arabia has arisen primarily out of the changed conditions that have been brought about by the extended use of air power in general,and the projected air  route along the Arabian littoral of the Gulf in particular.We have therefore examined the problem with special reference to these new factors.    2.  Our report is divided into two parts.  Part I deals with propositions whichquite  definitely lie within the scope of our terms of  reference, and is signed by thewhole Sub-Committee.   Part II deals with a  proposition which, while outside theliteral scope of our terms of reference, cannot be divorced from their subject-matter;and a portion of the Sub-Committee feel that it should be ventilated.  ConsequentlyPart II is signed only  by the Chairman,  and the representatives of the Admiralty,War Office, and Air Ministry.                                   PART I.             Existing Political Arrangements in the Persian Gulf.     1.  At the outset of our inquiry we  thought it essential to obtain a precisedefinition of the existing responsibilities of the various Departments concerned  inPersian Gulf questions.  The note on this subject which was prepared at our request,and has been accepted by all concerned, is attached as an Appendix to this Report.             The Setting Up of  Standing  Co-ordinating Committees.     2.  This note shows how large is the number of Government Departments whichhave sometimes to be  consulted before a decision can be reached over questions thatarise in the Gulf and adjacent territories.   In the past this consultation has taken the  form either of  Inter-Departmental  correspondence, or  of informal  Inter-Departmental conference.   But,  to judge  from  the instances of delay  which arequoted in the Air Staff Memorandum on &quot; the use of air power as illustrated by therecent operations in Arabia&quot; (Enclosure to Paper No. P.G. 2) and other instanceslaid before  the present  Committee,  neither of  these has  proved  altogethersatisfactory; and it appears that it might be of considerable advantage, as reducingthe  chances of  confusion  or delay,  to make some systematic  arrangements forco-ordination.     3.   We therefore recommend that two Standing Co-ordinating Committees ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence, the one ministerial and the other official, shouldbe  set up to deal with such Middle  East  questions as concern  two or  moreDepartments.    4.   The composition that we suggest for  the ministerial Committee is :         The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.        The Secretary of State for the Colonies.        The Secretary of State for  War.        The Secretary of State for India.        The Secretary of State for Air.        The First Lord of the Admiralty;  with a Secretary from the Committee of            Imperial Defence Secretariat.    5.   The composition that we  suggest for the official Committee is as follows :     Chairman :  To be nominated by the Colonial Office.    Members :  Representatives of the Foreign Office, War Office, India Office, Air        Ministry and Admiralty; with a Secretary from the Committee of Imperial        Defence Secretariat.[20290]
     6.  As regards procedure, we think that meetings should be summoned only as and when required by one or other of the interested Departments, for the examina-tion of a specific problem (or problems), the initiative in each case being taken bythe interested Department communicating their requirements to the Secretary, whowould then place himself in communication with the Chairman.     7.  Further, we  consider  that the ministerial  Committee  need not,  generallyspeaking, be troubled to assemble except (i) to deal with questions upon which theofficial Committee fail to reach agreement; or (ii) to reconsider recommendations ofthe official Committee,  which any of the Ministers concerned may find themselvesunable to approve.                 References to London by the Local Authorities.     8.  Another direction in which the existing machinery might be rendered lessslow and cumbrous would be to reduce the number of questions which the authorities on the spot are required to refer Home.   This might be done in two  ways, whichmutually  react on each other : first by  giving  local  Authorities the  fullestdiscretionary powers that circumstances permit; and, secondly, by arranging for the closest co-operation between them.               The Discretionary Powers  of the Local Authorities.    9.  As regards  the first,  we  appreciate  that, generally   speaking,  it is impracticable to lay down hard-and-fast rules, and that each case must be considered on its merits.  But the particular  question of the establishment of the air route along the Arabian littoral of the G-ulf falls in rather a special category; and we think thatthe local authorities responsible for this project should be given instructions whichallow them the greatest  latitude.  We therefore suggest that, if this has not alreadybeen done, the Resident in the Persian Gulf should be given definite instructions, inthe light of the decision* taken by the Cabinet when the Persian Gulf Sub-committee report was under consideration,  that it is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto establish  an  air  route  along the  Arabian littoral   as  economically and  asexpeditiously as possible, and that he should continue, in direct consultation withthe Air Officer Commanding in Iraq, to  take  such administrative  and  executive action locally as may  be required. He might be told that he should report progressperiodically to London,  but  that  references on administrative or executive matters,save where questions of  policy are concerned, should be the exception.        The Centralisation of Questions affecting  the Arabian Air Route.    10.  And there is another point  which arises out of  this recommendation.Although His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided  that the establishment of an air route along the Arabian littoral is to be prosecuted as a matter of high strategicalimportance, the Air Ministry are placed at a disadvantage in carrying out this workin that, on its political side,  it does not as a whole concern any one Department inparticular.  Under the existing policy  of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the responsi-bilities of the India  Office  and  the Government  of  India  are confined  to  themaintenance  of  maritime peace in  the Gulf and  to the coastal area of the Arablittoral; and His  Majesty&apos;s  Government have  not in  the  past contemplated  any extension of  these responsibilities  into the  hinterland,  which  has now assumedimmediate importance in view of  the alignment of the air route.  Any question ofthe extension of British responsibilities into the hinterland may raise large questionsof policy, which would, of course, have to be considered on their merits.  Again, theair route is of interest to the  Colonial Office only in so far as it might react on their responsibilities in Iraq and Palestine, and, in respect of the Hasa Section,  on ourrelations with Ibn Saud.  In  these circumstances, the Air Ministry urge that, so faras is possible, all questions concerning the air route should be dealt with by the sameDepartment in London.  The business merits of such an arrangement are  incon-testable.  This question is further developed in Part  II  to this  Report,  which,however, is signed only by a portion of the Committee.              *  Cabinet 49 (28),  Conclusion 1, circulated  as C.I.D.

    Co-operation between the Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Air Officer                             Commanding in Iraq.    11.  Turning now to the question of closer  co-operation between  the localauthorities in the Persian Gulf  regions, we have  been  given to  understand that,generally  speaking, present arrangements may be  regarded  as satisfactory.  but here again, we  think that the particular  question of  the  relations between  the resident in the Persian Gulf and the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq in respect ofthe use of Air Power in the Gulf and  its vicinity merits special attention.   Wesuggest that the Resident, Persian Gulf, should, subject  to general conditions to bearranged in London, be empowered to apply direct to  the Air Officer  commanding in Iraq for air assistance in connection with Arab matters in the same way as he now applies to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, for naval assistance; it being,of course, understood that the despatch  of  aircraft from Iraq, for employment inthe Gulf, must at all times be conditional upon the situation in Iraq.    12.  Further, we think that  the Resident, Persian Gulf,  should be encouraged to make use  of  such  facilities as the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq can make available for  his transportation by air on his visits  to the Arabian littoral.               The Appointment of Resident in the Persian  Gulf.    13.  Having regard  to  the  new factors  in  the  Gulf situation, and  to  theincreased,  responsibility on the Arab coast that falls to the Resident in the persian gulf as a result, we thought  it right to examine the circumstances of that appoint-ment in some detail  We appreciate that it is not for us to recommend any change in existing arrangements, but we feel that, having regard to recent  political develop-ments  on  the Persian side, and the  contemplated establishment of an air route onthe Arabian side of the Gulf, we would not be justified  in omitting to point out that,in certain respects, these  arrangements do not appear  altogether  appropriate oradequate to present conditions.    14.  Under  existing arrangements the  Resident in the  Persian Gulf  alsoperforms  the duties of Consul-General  for South Persia.  We are  aware that thePersian Gulf Committee have themselves given serious consideration to the questionof separating these appointments, and of removing the Residency from Bushire (in persia) on the grounds that this would be very acceptable  to the Persian Government,and might serve as a useful bargaining counter in the current negotiations at Tehran.But there are practical as well as diplomatic considerations to be taken into account,in that the increased responsibilities of  the Resident in  the Persian Gulf, as such,render it desirable that he should be able to devote his time and attention primarily to the Arab littoral.   We suggest, this being so, that, if circumstances permit, heshould be located &quot;on his beat,&quot; instead of on the opposite side  of the Gulf.  Weunderstand that the  whole question, including that of a  site, is  under  active consideration.    15.  And there  are other features in connection  with the appointment ofResident to which we desire  to draw attention.  As things now stand, the appoint-ment lies exclusively in the hands of the Government of India (though we understandthat, in practice, the Minister at Tehran is consulted before an  appointment is made),and is filled from the cadre of the Indian Political Service.   Although it is one ofthe ten or eleven &quot;first-class &quot; appointments  in that Service, it is, we understand,probably the least popular.   Its emoluments are found by the Government of Indiaand the Foreign Office in equal shares.    16.   The recent assertion  of Persian authority in the Gulf, the great imperialiniportance of the organisation and  maintenance of the air  route along the Arablittoral, and the considerable political  issues  to which its establishment may  giverise, make it  desirable that  the  post of Resident in the Gulf  should be entrustedonly to the very best men available.   It  is for  consideration in  these circumstances,whether the  appointment ought not to  be made more attractive from the point ofview  of prestige and  remuneration.  The questions whether the field of selectionshould be extended beyond the present  restricted limits, and  whether the imperialGovernment should have a greater say in the appointment, also merit  consideration.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS17.   To sum up, our unanimous conclusions are these : (a.) Two Standing  Co-ordinating Committees of  the Committee of  Imperial      Defence, the one ministerial and the other official, should be set up to      deal  with  such Middle  East  questions  as concern  two  or  more      Departments (paragraph 3).(b.) The composition of the ministerial Sub-Committee should be :            The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.           The Secretary of State for the Colonies.           The Secretary of State for War.           The Secretary of State for India.           The Secretary of State for Air.           The  First  Lord  of  the  Admiralty;  with  a  Secretary  from  the               Committee of Imperial Defence Secretariat (paragraph 4).(c.) The composition of the official Sub-Committee should be :            Chairman :  To be nominated by the Colonial Office.           Members : Representatives of the Foreign Office, War Office,  India               Office, Air Ministry and Admiralty;  with  a Secretary from the               Committee of Imperial Defence Secretariat (paragraph 5).(d.) Meetings  of the above Committees should be summoned only as and when      required by one  or other of the interested Departments for the examina-      tion  of  a specific problem (or problems).   Further, the  ministerial      Committee need  not, generally speaking, be troubled  to assemble, except        (i) to deal with questions upon which the official Committee fail to reach            agreement; or      (ii) to reconsider recommendations of the official Committee which any            Minister  concerned finds himself unable to approve (paragraphs            6 and 7).(e.) Local Authorities  should be given the greatest possible latitude on all      questions, particularly  those relating to  the establishment  and main-      tenance of the air route (paragraphs 9 and 10).(/.) It would be of great advantage to the Air Ministry  if all questions con-      cerning the air route were dealt with by the same Department in London      (paragraph 10).(g.) There should be the closest co-operation between the Resident in the Persian      Gulf and the Air Officer commanding in Iraq.  The  former should        (i) be empowered to apply direct to the latter for air assistance; and      (ii) make as much use as possible of such facilities for his transportation            by  air as  the Air Officer commanding in Iraq can make available            (paragraphs  11 and 12).(h.) The Resident, Persian Gulf, should, in view of the growing importance of      the Arab  littoral, have his headquarters, if possible, on the Arab, and      not the Persian, side of the Gulf (paragraph 14).
(i.) Consideration might, with advantage, be given to the following questions      in regard to  the  appointment of the Resident in the Persian  Gulf      (paragraphs 15 and 16) :        (i.)  Should the appointment be made more attractive from the point of            view of prestige and remuneration ?      (ii.)  Should the field of selection be extended beyond its present restricted            limits ?      (iii.)  Should  the  Imperial  Government  have a  greater  say in  the            appointment ?                              (Signed)      N. F.  WARREN  FISHER.

                                  PART II.  The Possibility of Transferring  to the Foreign Office  the General  Control  of       Our Relations with the Whole of the Territories in the Middle  East.    1.  The  recommendations summarised in the concluding paragraph of Part  1above will  undoubtedly tend to simplify and  speed  up the existing machinery for political control in  Arabia, but those of the Sub-Committee who have signed this second Part of the  Report feel strongly that our difficulties cannot be  satisfactorilyresolved save by a radical change in the machinery  itself.  In these circumstances,we think that we are justified in inviting  attention to what appears  to us to  be  apossible solution of  the trouble, and of assembling the arguments for and against its adoption.    2.  It will be generally agreed that the most effective method of obviating over-lapping of functions, conflicts of  departmental opinion,  and consequent delays  in reaching decisions  would be, if practicable,  to entrust the general control of ourrelations, whether administrative or political, with the whole of the territories in theMiddle East  in which  we are interested, i.e.,  the Sudan, Egypt, Palestine, Trans-jordania,  Iraq,  Arabia  (excluding, perhaps,  Aden  and  such  matters of detailedadministration as are primarily the concern of the Indian Government) and Persia,to a  single department  of  State.   It  would, in particular, be  an  immeasurableadvantage  to  the Air  Ministry, which is, with very small forces, responsible for defence over a large part of the Middle  East;  and to the Royal Air Force, to whomfor this reason free communication throughout this sphere is  of vital  strategic importance, to have to  deal with one authority and one only, both on the spot and inLondon.    3.  Inasmuch as the responsibility for relations  with the independent Kingdomof Persia must clearly remain under the  Foreign Office, as also must  those  with egypt, Nejd and the Hedjaz, and, presumably, the affairs of the Sudan, the choice of the Department  to look after the block of countries we have mentioned is limitedto the Foreign Office;  and the problem reduces itself  to this.  Is it practicable, or desirable,  for the Foreign Office to take over the responsibility for the other countriesreferred to in the preceding paragraph ?    4.  In this connection we were informed that there was a considerable divergence of opinion in the Cabinet of 1920 as to whether the territories in  question should bethe responsibility of the Colonial Secretary or the Foreign Secretary, and that thedecision in favour of the former was by a majority;  and we, therefore, thought  it right to re-examine the proposition in the  light of the experience of the past eight years.  Our inquiries have shown that  a divergence of opinion still exists;  and  itmay be helpful if we assemble the  principal arguments on each side.    5.  The arguments that have  been  put forward by those who are  in oppositionto the proposal may be summarised as follows       (a.) Administration is not the business of the Foreign Office, and its attempts to           conduct  it  in  the  past have generally  been attended by  failure.   An           overwhelming case should be established before the administration of any           further  territory should be entrusted to it.    (&amp;.) The outlook, training, and temperament of administrators and diplomats are           essentially different.  The Foreign Office does not produce administrators,           and when it requires them, has to borrow from other branches of Govern-           ment service.  On more than one occasion in recent years the qualifications           of Governors thus recruited have been questionable.   Yet,  in  these           Mandated Territories, though diplomatic abilities may be of importance,           the quality of the administration is the criterion by which world opinion           will judge the success or failure of the Mandatory Power.     (ci) The Sudan is under Foreign Office control solely because  the Condominium           with Egypt makes it impossible  to place the territory under the control of           any other Department.   That it should have been administered with some           success  is due to peculiar and  exceptional circumstances.  Firstly, the           Sudan is practically isolated in the middle of  the continent and removed           from external influences and distractions, so that all problems of govern-           ment are considerably simplified.   Secondly, it has been possible to endow
      the country with an efficient staff of numerous carefully selected English-      men, and the administration, though good,  is very expensive.  Finally,      and resulting from this, the amount of administrative control exercised      from London is infinitesimally small.6.   The arguments on the other side may be summarised as follows : (a.) In the case of both Iraq and Transjordan, our position is that of advisers      to  the  local Governments:  we  are  not  directly  administering  the      territories.  In regard to Palestine, we are, it is true, directly responsible      for the government of the country.  The burden of administration was      heavy at first, as was natural in a country which had just emerged from      conditions of war, and in which an entirely new administrative machine      had to be set up.  It still remains heavy;  but it might have been relaxed      in course of time, as the new regime became more stabilised, had it not      been  for  the  unhappy  events of  August last.    These events  have      undoubtedly caused a serious set-back, the permanent effects of which can      hardly be gauged at present.(6.) The special business of the Colonial Office is  undoubtedly administration.      But, in the first place, the functions of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the      two out of the three countries under consideration are, as stated above,      advisory rather than administrative.   Secondly, the Colonial  Office, if      their administration is to be effective,  should be permitted to administer      by their own methods, and along tried and proved lines.  This they are      frequently precluded from doing by international complications  arising      out of the mandatory  status of the countries in question.  As a result,      the advantages of Colonial Office control are to some extent  neutralised.(c.) Under present arrangements a situation has grown up in which different      Departments of State are apt to find themselves ranged on the  side of      rival  Arab chieftains : the  Colonial Office  on  the  side of the  Sharifian      family, King Feisal and  Amir Abdullah; the  Foreign Office and India      Office  on that  of Ibn Saud.  Unification of control would enable the.      Department dealing with the problem to take a more comprehensive view      of the whole matter, and would tend to promote a more consistent policy.(d.) It is understood that Iraq is likely to be admitted to the League of Nations      in 1932,  in which  case the responsibility  for  our relations with  that      country will presumably have, ostensibly, in any case, to be transferred      from the Colonial Office to the Foreign Office.(e.) &quot;With regard to the argument that Foreign Office attempts at administration      have been unsuccessful in the past,  we assume that reference is  to such      places as Uganda and other Protectorates.  In regard to this, we think it      fair to point out that the Foreign Office had to discharge the difficult role      of dealing with these areas in the pioneer stage;  and that their successors      have at least had the advantage of building upon the foundations which      they had laid.   Moreover,  the selection of personnel for administering      any such areas on the spot is not in the least  confined to officers of the      Foreign Office or  Diplomatic  Service;  the  field of  choice  alike for      Governors and their  subordinates  should not be artificially limited,      though  the natural expectation  would be to find  men of the  right       experience largely from  the Overseas,  Colonial, Indian, and Sudanese      Services.

APPENDIX.       &quot; DE FACTO &quot; POSITION AS REGARDS POLITICAL ARRANGEMENTS IN THE                                PERSIAN GULF.    ALL the posts in the Gulf, with the exception of one or two minor consularappointments on the Persian side,  are filled from the Political Department of theGovernment of India.  The charges in connection with them are, on the Arab  side,borne wholly by India, save in the case of Koweit, where expenditure is halved  withthe Home Government.  On the Persian side they are shared between India and theHome Government.    2.  The chief authority in the Gulf is the Political Resident and Consul-general at Bushire.  Subordinate to this officer on the Arab side are the Political Agents atKoweit and Bahrein, the Residency Agent at Shargah (who looks after the Trucialcoast)  and the  Political  Agent  at Muscat all  European officers of the indian political Department, except the Residency Agent, who is an Arab.  These officerstake their orders through the Political  Resident,  and  correspond  with  higher authority through him.  The civil judicial powers which they exercise under variousOrders in Council are also exercised by them subject to final appeal to the political resident.    3.  On the Persian side, the Resident has no longer any functions of importance as Resident.  His responsibilities on this side are chiefly consular, and are discharged by him  in his capacity as Consul-General.  In that capacity he has subordinate tohim consular officers at  Bushire, Bandar Abbas, and  a Consular Agent at Lingah,while he is himself responsible, not to the Government of  India or to the ColonialOffice, but to the Foreign Office through the Minister at Tehran.    4.  The Resident is not concerned directly with Iraq, nor ordinarily, as mattersnow stand, with Ibn Saud; but  his responsibilities in regard to Koweit inevitably involve  some contact with the British Authorities in Iraq.    5.  To  understand  the position of  the  Resident vis-a-vis outside british authorities,  it is necessary to premise that the Masterton-Smith Committee of  1921recommended that the Colonial Office should become  the responsible British authority on all matters relating to  policy in Arab areas (including the Arabian littoral ofthe Persian Gulf) : but  that  &quot; for administrative and purely local  purposes thecontrol  of the Government of  India over the Arabian littoral of the Persian  Gulfshould be maintained,&quot;  while  &quot;the prior concurrence of the Colonial  Office shouldbe obtained by them to  any measures of political significance.&quot;   The channel ofcontrol  in all cases was  to be the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who was,as hitherto, to be found from the service of the Government of India.   The reportof the Masterton-Smith Committee was accepted  by  His Majesty&apos;s  Governmentsubject  to two provisos, one of which was that the approval of the Government ofIndia  should be obtained.  That approval  was  never  in  fact  given,  but theCommittee&apos;s proposals in regard to the  Persian  Gulf were adopted, provisionally,as a working basis.    6.  The Masterton-Smith  Committee did not define  &quot;policy&quot; or attempt todraw * a precise  line between questions of policy and &quot;administrative and local&quot;matters; but some indication of the underlying intention was given by  the following passage in their report:  &quot;On the assumption that it is the intention of the Cabinetthat the Middle Eastern, or rather the Arab, problem should be treated as one organicwhole, we consider that the guiding  principle should be that the new department should be responsible for directing policy as regards the whole Arabian peninsula,subject to  certain qualifications ....  regarding the Kingdom  of  the Hedjaz.&quot;It is in practice in the area in question exceedingly difficult to draw a line betweenpurely administrative and local matters and questions of policy;  or to decide at  whatpoint one rather than the other aspect begins to prevail.  &quot; Policy &quot; has in practicenormally been interpreted as covering major questions of policy affecting Arabianaffairs in general, and the policy of  His Majesty&apos;s Government as affecting Ibn Saud.Questions falling under either of those heads have remained the concern of, and havebeen dealt with primarily by, the Colonial Office (in consultation, as the circumstances
might make it desirable, with the Foreign Office and/or India Office);  other questionshave continued, as in the past, to be dealt with by the Government of India and the india Office, again in consultation, where necessary, with the Foreign Office and/orColonial Office.    The Colonial Office in 1924 instructed the Political  Resident that they were not&quot;directly   concerned  with  the local  affairs of  Koweit,  whether political  or administrative, nor, indeed,  with those of any other Arabian States bordering uponthe Persian Gulf, except in so far as these may  react  upon Arabian  politics ingeneral, or upon His Majesty&apos;s Governments relations with Ibn Saud in  particular.Consequently, in all  matters which relate solely to  the internal administration andpolitics of  these areas,  and  which are unlikely to have external repercussions, you should regard the Government of  India as the responsible authority to whom you should report and from whom you should seek instructions.   Upon such matters Ishould, however, be glad if you would keep me informed, in order that,  should anyquestion which in its initial stages was  one of purely local interest later  become oneof external importance and likely to have reactions upon territories or political relations which are primarily the &quot;concern of this Department,  I may not, when thematter is  ultimately  referred  to  me for instructions, be ignorant of  its earlierdevelopments.  You should also keep the Government of India similarly informed ofany action which you may take upon my instructions in regard to matters directly or indirectly affecting territories under the control of the  Colonial Office.   To draw ahard and fast distinction between matters of  local  and  matters of external interestwould be extremely difficult,  if not impossible, and I must  leave it to your discretion,as and when  cases arise, to  decide  to whom you should apply  for instructions.Doubtless  many  borderline  cases will  arise, involving  both local and externalinterests, and in  such cases you should refer the facts both to the  Government ofIndia and to this Department, when the necessary action to be taken will be concertedand instructions will be issued to you accordingly.&quot;  At the same time, the ColonialOffice explained that the grant of oil concessions in the States of the Arabian littoralshould not  be regarded  as a  matter of purely local interest, and that on this subject the Resident should look to  the Colonial Office for instructions.    7.  In practice matters have proceeded on this basis up to the present time.  InMuscat no question  of major Arabian policy has arisen,  and no question  ofimportance affecting relations with Ibn Saud. In consequence, the Government ofIndia  and  the India Office,  in consultation where necessary with the Foreign Officeand/or the Colonial Office, have retained  in this  State full control of general policy as of internal administration. They and His Majesty&apos;s Government are  represented in the  State by a Political Agent found from the Indian  Political Department  andunder  the orders of the Political Resident in the Gulf.  The expenses of this officer and the Muscat subsidies of Rs. 1,86,400  per  annum have throughout been borne by india.    On the Trucial Coast the same is approximately the case.   No  question of major policy has arisen.  Certain questions affecting Ibn Saud&apos;s relations with the  localSheikhs and the possibility of  his penetration  in this area have been consideredbetween the Government of  India and the India Office and the Colonial Office.  Thepolitics of this area have,  however, remained essentially &quot;local,&quot; and thus the concern of the Government of India  and the  India Office, as has  its  internal administration.  (Such expenses as there are are borne by India, and the Govern-ment of India and His Majesty&apos;s Government are represented by an Arab ResidencyAgent, reporting directly to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.)     The same is generally  true of Bahrein.  The Colonial  Office and the ForeignOffice  have, however, been closely associated with the instructions issued by theGovernment of India on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, e.g.,  as  regards thedeposition of Sheikh Isa in  1923.  The various replies made to the Persian claims toBahrein have been prepared in close consultation between the Foreign Office  andIndia  Office,  the  concurrence  of  the Colonial  Office being  obtained before theirdespatch.     In Koweit the position is different.  The close  connection  of Koweit  with questions arising in regard  to Iraq and Nejd and the absence of purely local issues of  importance has resulted in policy in that State being in effect essentially the concern of the Colonial Office and being dealt with  primarily by that Departmentsince 1921.  But throughout that period the Foreign Office and the India Office andthe Government of India, as circumstances might require, have been kept in  close touch  with developments and consulted.   It  will be appreciated  that in this area
particularly border-line cases tend to arise of the nature referred to in the ColonialOffice despatch of 1924 quoted in paragraph 6 above.  Internal administration inKoweit has in theory remained the  business of the Government of India.  But nointernal question has arisen since 1921-22 which has called for  important actioneither by the Home or the Indian Government. In this State, India, however, hascontinued to share the expenses of the Political Agency, and the Political Agent hascontinued to be borne on the cadre of the Indian Service.    8.  From the above it will be seen that while under the terms  of the Masterton-Smith recommendations the Resident was to be responsible to the Colonial Office forall &quot; matters relating to policy &quot; arising in connection with the Arab littoral, he hasin practice remained responsible to the Government of India, except in  the case ofKoweit and on questions affecting Ibn Saud or the  development  of  oil resources.Save in respect of those matters, the Political Resident  has taken his orders on matters affecting the States of the Arab littoral from the  Government of India, orfrom His Majesty&apos;s Government through  the India Office.  The orders in questionhave been framed, where necessary,  after consultation with the Colonial Office andForeign Office, who have in all cases  been kept in close touch with developments.  Inthe case of Koweit  (save as regards  internal administration)  and of all  matters affecting relations with Ibn Saud dealt with through the Persian Gulf, the political resident has taken his orders wholly from the Colonial Office.  Those orders have asa rule been issued under consultation with the India Office and Foreign Office as thecase might  be.  As regards consular matters on the south Persian shore, the political resident has taken his orders from the Foreign Office.    9.  Some  reference may perhaps  be thought desirable to  the relation  of thePolitical Resident to the Senior Naval Officer of the Persian Gulf Squadron of theNavy.   This Squadron  consists of three or  four sloops.   Its coaling and refittingexpenses are borne by India.  It is under  the Naval Commander-in-Chief,  east indies, but the sloops, which are continuallv cruising in or about the Persian Gulf,are for practical  purposes at the disposal of the Political Resident (in agreementwith the Senior Naval Officer), and  the responsibility for  invoking their assistanceor asking the  Senior Naval Officer to despatch one of them to a particular place inconnection  with a  particular situation rests with the Political  Resident, who isclearly in the  best position to co-ordinate action in the Gulf, since he is  in touch atonce with the Persian and the Arab sides, and since communications from the various departments of His Majesty &quot;s Government  who are interested  in  the Gulf,  andfrom the Government of India, pass  through him to the subordinate offices under his control on the  Arab or on the Persian sides.o
