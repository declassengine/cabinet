                 0 A B I NET.      THE PARLIAMENTARY PROGRAMME, 1930-51.  Memorandum by the %Ivarliamentary -Secretary to the Treasury .     (Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister in      accordance with Cabinet 41(30), Conclusion 1).         Assuming that the most convenient date for there-assembly of Parliament, having regard to the ImperialConference and the Indian Constitutional Conference, isTuesday, 28th October, 1930, I estimate that after allowing for the usual routine and financial business, and forOpposition motions, the time available in the House ofCommons for legislation and Government motions in thenext Session will be approximately:     I  28th October to 19th December............13 Days.    II  27th January to 2nd April.....i..... ..... 17  &quot;   III  14th April to 22nd May ....................  5  &quot;    IV  2nd June to 31st July .....................12  &quot;                                                    47_____________         I suggest that the Government 1s Legislativeprogrammes should be mapped out so as to admit of the intro-duotion of measures roughly in accordance with the following-table :    A.   House of Commons.         Period I.   28th October to 19th December.                     3 Major Bills (2 for Standing Committee and                                    one for floor of the House).                     3 Second Class Bills.                     4 Minor Bills.                            . -1-  .       .    .rpCUMEM)  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S  GOVERNMENT). SET.
         SS.period II..  3 7th January to 2nd April.                     One Major Bill  (for floor of the House).                     One Second Class Bill.                     Two Miner Bills.         Period III. IMlLAlllALAc.  End May,-                     One Major Bill for floor of the House.         Period IV.   nd June to 51st July.                     Emergency and Minor Bills only.B.  House of lords.         Period I.   Two or Three Second Glass Bills and four                     Minor Bills.         Period II.  One Second Class Bill and four or five                     Minor Bills.         Period III. One Second Class Bill.         Period IV.  Emergency and Miner Bills only.         It is desirable that, &quot;before the Prorogation-, theCabinet should determine what Major Bills are to he takennext Session, and their order to introduction, in order that Major Bills (2 for Standing Committees first,  and then one for the floor of the House) mas7 be entered upon immediatelyafter the rebate on the Address is concluded on  5th Kcvember.         I understand that a provisional list of Second class and Minor Bills have already been collected, and the HomeAffairs Committee might be requested to arrange these in orderof importance provisionally before the  holidays.         In this calculation I have allowed 0 days for supplementary Estimates, 6 days for the Budget and 16 days in all for the Finance Bill.                             (Sgd.)  THOMAS KEHNEDT.12, Downing Street, S.W.1.,   July 10th, IV50.
