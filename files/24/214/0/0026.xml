I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues the following comments on the points arising cut of thereport of this Committee which were reserved for discussion at our meeting on the 30th July (Cabinet conclusion 44(30)of 23rd July).Rstoort:  Part I.          (a) Cone1us ion (h):  Transfer to the Arab side of  the Persian G-ulf of the headquarters of the Political  Resident, Persian Gulf.          I have at an earlier stage reached an agreement on  this subject with the Secretary of State for Foreign  Affairs.  The matter is now far advanced, and I understand  that we hope  shortly to make a communication to the  Persian Government regarding it.  I see no objection to  acceptance of the Committee&apos;s recommendation.          (b) Qonc 1 u si on .X i.), - Miscellaneous questions in  regard to the appointment of Political Resident in the  Persian Gulf.          It has been impossible in the short time available  to me to  consider this conclusion in consultation with the  Government.   But my own views on the three points covered  by it are as  follows$-      (i) The appointment is already sufficiently attractive          from  trie point of view of prestige and^          remuneration.   Its incumbent is ^he chief         British representative in the Persian  Gulf?  and                                                receives
          receives approximately  4,000 per annum          (including  400 &quot;per annum sumptuary allowance);.          But  I have no objection to putting the point uo          the  Government of India.      (ii) While the limits of the present field of selection          are  relatively restricted, nothing is to be          pained by extending: them.  It is &quot;increasingly          difficult, now that- the war period which          produced a supply of officers who had acquired          first-hand experience of the Middle East is          growing more remote, to find officers adequately          qualified for political employment in Arab-          speaking countries from sources outside the          Political Department of the Government of          India, which normally staffs the Arab Agencies          in the Persian Gulf,&quot; Aden, and a substantial          proportion of Consular appointments in Persia,          and which furnishes, in my view, as satisfactory          a reservoir as any that is likely to be found.          (It  is noteworthy that Sir John Maifey, Sir Percy          Cox, Sir Henry Dobbs, Sir A.T. Wilson and          Sir  Francis Humphrys have all been drawn from          this source for the hishest appointments in the          Sudan and Iraq.)  If af any time a          particularly suitable cndidate for the post          of Political Resident is available from          outside, and special circumstances exist which          make it desirable to secure his services,          consideration would I have no doubt be given        ,  by the Government of India to his claims.  But          the present arrangement works adequately          (though here as elsewhere difficulties may          admittedly arise from time to time),  and I see         . no advantage in its modification.    (iii) I doubt if it is necessary to associate the          Imperial Government, who have already in          practice an opportunity of expressing their          views before an officer is posted to Bushire,          more closely with this appointment,.          particularly if my recommendation be accepted          that the field of selection should remain          as it is, and I recommend that no -change          should be made.  I could not, in any case, agree          to any alteration in the present arrangements          except after consultation with the Government of          India.Ear t J Ijo f Mthe JR e pp. r t.          The recommendations in this part of theReport areof more immediate concern to the Foreign Office and colonial Office than to the Secretary of State for India.But the arguments in favour of avoiding fundamental changes                                                     now,
no?/, and postponing a decision until 193-2, or such date as our mandate in Iraq nay terminate, are in my view strong.Though from time to time Persian Gulf affairs take on amore general  importance in so far as they affect Britishrelations with Ibn Saud, generally speaking Indian interestsin the Gulf area, if not paramount, are very considerable.The Persian Gulf is also an area of great strategic importance from the Indian point of view.  On broad political grounds,therefore, I  should be reluctant to acquiesce, in presentcircumstances, in anv reduction of the desree of control exercised by  the G-overimentof India in the Gulf area.  I will only add that so far as I can judge, the present arrangements,provisional as they may be, in practice appear to work smoothlygiven good will and friendly co-operation between ourDepartments;   and that the negotiations with Ibn Saud inDecember 1928 - February      show that delay can be eliminated when there is urgency, despite the number of departments affected.  I feel that where so many different,and often conflicting, interests and points of view areconcerned, an arrangement which provides for the fullestcollaboration between the different Departments respectivelyresponsible for those interests and points of view is themost likely to produce a really sound line of policy.                                        W.B.28th July 1930.
