I circulate  to ray colleagues a minute by Lord  Cecilembodying  the  re-draft of Article 2,of the Model  Treatyreferred to  at  the end of C. P. 279(30) ,9A(Intd.)  A.K.Foreign  Office, S.W.1;     July  30th, 1930 .
Secretary of State .     I syffcmit that the result of oar discussicn this morningis that the first paragraph of proposal B tc Article 2 should read as follows:     &quot;  If in the event cf a threat of war the Council acting     in virtue of the provision cf Article 2 cf the Covenant     of the league of Rations recommends the withdrawal of the     (Land) forces cf one of the High Contracting parties which     has invaded or has threatened to invade the territory of     another state or one of the zones demilitbribed in virtue     cf international treaties, the High Contracting parties     undertake to comply therewith without delay.  In any such     recommendation the Council may propose the withdrawal     of the forces on each aide behind the line to he fixed     by the Council.  Such line must not, however, he so     fixed as to deprive the state concerned cf the use of     essential varies cf defence , M     The second paragraph will  remain as it was originallydrafted.     It &quot;was understood that the insertion of the word &quot;land&quot;before forces although desirable,  was not necessary.     I am advised by Sir Pilliam Falkin that there is ncobjection to substituting &quot;invaded&quot; for &quot;penetrated into&quot;nor for altering &quot;a zone11 into &quot;one of the aones&quot; .     It was further understood  that we should make it cleareither by an article in the treaty or otherwise that curratification of it must depend upon&apos; the conclusion of ageneral disarmament treaty.                                     (Sd) C^CIL.                                             July 24th, 1930.
