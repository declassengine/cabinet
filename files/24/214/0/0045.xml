UilSMPIOYMSag POLICY.           Memorandum bjr tho Lord Privy Seal. (Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Prime Minister). 1.        During tho past two months I have devoted the whole of my timo to an endeavour to get a clear grasp of the nature of the unemployment problem.           What are the causes of our present unemployment?   To what extent are they temporary or permanent in character? What is the measure cf unemployment,yraent which represents contraction of world markets for British manufactures?   To that extent is it possible for any British Government to control those causes, and how far are they beyond our control? 2.        Answers to the  above questions  involve an exhaustive analysis Of our industrial  and commercial activities,  past and present,  at home and abroad.   Numerous documents dealing with these  questions have been circulated in the last few months by the Secretariat, by members of the E.A.C. on  the state of trade, by Major Attlse, and by Sub-Committees oi&apos; the S.A.C.  in the form of reports on  Cotton,  Iron and Steel and Agriculture.   In addition  to these there are tho series of reports issued by the - Balfour Committee after a prolonged study of  the whole field. It is  therefore quite unnecessary  for  Die  to add much to tho mass of data already collected and circulated  and  I  propose to do no more than stress the outstanding impressions  which  a study of those  doouments together  with an examination  of Board  of Trade statistics  have loft upon me.
5.        To avoid misunderstanding I i&amp;oul&amp; first refer tothe document circulated by the Secretariat U.&apos;P. (50) 13.In that document the unemployment figures are divided into three categories as follows:-     (1)  The unemployment figure which would exist evonif industry were in a healthy and prosperous condition.     (E)  The unemployment attributable to the present world-wide trade depression.     (3)  The unemployment arising from the post wardifficulties specially affecting particular Britishindustries.          I fully agree with this analysis of the figures.In the remarks which follow I have in mind primarily theunemployed included in the third ox these categories.4.        My first conclusion is that whatever action wemay take, we cannot look to our staple industries, built up so largely on export trade, to give employment in thefuture to all those -workers now nominally attached to them.At the same time it is clear that our staple industries arecrying out for reorganisation and modernisation.   Britishindividualistic methods, so successful in the past when we were &quot;the workshop of the world&quot;,  are in many casesdoomed to failure in present-day conditions-   But themoney needed for new plant and equipment cannot be found by our staple industries because the  investor is not unnaturally shy s.g. of textile and steel shares, anarightly assumes that he can do better with his money else-where .   How are v.exto break through  this vicious circle?Reorganisation is imperative if we are to stop the rot.It may also enable us to regain some  of our lost exporttrade, although I do not think for a  moment that anythingwe can do by way of reorganisation can restore to us our
 foreign markets for our staple  products, to the full extent to which we have supplied them  in  the past.   Some of the causes which have deprived  us of trade  In these markets are permanent  in character and  largely beyond our control. 5.         It is unnecessary for me to sot forth the facts of each of the big industries in support of this view. The figures of the various  industries differ but the broad facts are the same, the causes  are similar&apos;, the character of the problem is alike in  all.    An examination of the facts in one of these industries indicates the nature of the problem in all. 6.        I propose to take the case of cotton as an example.          Tho Ministry of Labour figures for June show that of 554,790 insured persons in the cotton industry 234,347 or 42.2 per cent are on the live register.The July returns,  I air. informed, will show still higherfigures.   These figures are partly accounted for by thepresent political  situation in the East, and to that extent they belong to Category 2 in the document I have referredto above.   Tho trade statistics, however,  reveal thefact that a very considerable proportion of the whole isdue to permanent causes of  an entirely different character.7.   What are those causes?   The answer to this questioni3 the basis upon  which I found the conclusion set out above.   It is clearly revealed by the following analysis of the statistics  ol\the trade.    The export of cotton piece goods in 1913 amounted to 7,075 million yards;   this figure had fallen  by  19-29 to 3,765 million yards,  that isto say we had lost  by 1929 47$ of our total  pre-war
export trade in cotton piece goods.8.        When we look at the world markets we find that 6Zfo of our total exports ox cotton piecegoods were sent to India, China, Japan, Hong Kong,Dutch East Indies, Ceylon and the Straits Settle-commitments .   Of our total loss of trade in 1929 ascompared with 1913, 77 per cent is due to loss of markets in these countries.3.        Why have we lost so large a proportionof that great Eastern market?   The answer issimple...   A s umber of those countries have developed a huge cotton industry of their own,as the following figures show:-Cctton Spindles in Japan, China,, India                  1913          10 millions                  1928          21Power Looms in India 1914      104,000  &quot;     &quot;        &quot;   1926      167,000  &quot;     &quot;   &quot;  China 1914        5,000        &quot;   &quot;    &quot;   1928       30,000  &quot;     &quot;   &quot;  Japan 1914       25,000        &quot;        &quot;   1928       78,000          In 1914 those three countries bad 134,000power looms in 1923 tbey had 275,000 looms.   this great industrial development in the very centre ofour market constitutes a convincing answer to thequestion why we have lost so much  of our trade.

The answer issimple   A sumber of those countries have developed a huge cotton industry of their own,as the following figures show:-9. $.P.S-? .iS fes in Japan, China, India                  1913          10 millions                  1928          21Power Looms in India 1914      104,000  &quot;     &quot;        &quot;   1928      167,000  &quot;     &quot;   &quot;  China 1914        5,000  &quot;     &quot;   &quot;    &quot;   1928       30,000  &quot;     &quot;   &quot;  Japan 1914       25,000        &quot;        &quot;   1928       78,000          In 1914 those three countries had 134,000power looms in 1923 they had 275,000 looms -   this great industrial development in the very centre ofour market constitutes a convincing answer to thequestion why we have lost so much  of our trade.
10.      The Indian position is instructive.    During theyear ending March, 1914, we exported to India 3,104 million yards.   In the year ending March, 1930, we sent to the samemarket only 1,247 million yards, a drop of 1,857 million yards.   Why did we lose that market for 1,857 million yards?Was it (a) because India consumed less cotton cloth or (b)did some other country take our trade.   Tho answer to (a)is that in tho pre-war year India consumed 5,200 million yards, in the latter year 5,300 million yards.   There i3no falling off in consumption.   As to  (b) India Increasedher own annual production between 1914 and 1930 by 1,600million yards;   this accounts for the grce.ter part of ourloss.   In addxtion to tho great increase in India1 production , Japan, which in the pre-war year sent less th&amp;n9 million yards to India, in the latter year sent nearly 562million yards.   This enabled India to release some hundreds of millions of yards for export,   India is now developingher own industry under cover of protection.   She Is rapidlyreaching the stage whon she will supply the groater part ofher own requirements.   Theso are the causes which account for our loss of trade in India and what Is happening in india is typical of what is taking place in other comrtries.   Wehave been unable to maintain our exports of cotton piecegoods at the pre-war level in a single  important country andthe causes of our failure are permanent in character and beyond our control.11.      Tho facts of the coal industry tell the same taleas those of cotton.   The latest figures of mineworkers onthe live register Is 255^769.   These figures vary somewhatfrom month to month but they fairly represent the conditionof this industry during the past 9 or 10 years.   The causeshere are similar to those considered above.   They resemble
those in cotton in that they arc permanent and beyond our control.   The same considerations apply to one extent tothe iron and steel trades.12.      I think the evidence is overwhelming in supportof the contention that it is extremely unlikely that weshall in future employ an large a part of our population in producing Cotton, Coal, and Iron arid Steel forconsumption abroad, as in tho past.13.      There are two directions in which labourdisplaced from, those industries might look for employment: -   (a) The expansion of foreign trade in such of our        industries as are capable of expansion, e.g.        motors, chemicals, electrical engineering, and        the establishment of new branches of manufacture        for home and export trade.   (b) The development of production for the home        market at the expense of imports.        I attach the utmost importance to (a) but I do not see much prospoet of such early developments as would absorb those at present idle in say cotton, coal and stoel In the near future.        I am, therefore, driven to the further conclusion that, whllo we should do everything to encourage the expansion of existing industries and the development of new ones, we must at the same time consider how far it is practicable to obtain a larger&quot; share of our homo market to be supplied from the products of British labour. 14.       Another factor of which notice must be taken is the extent to which some at least of our- industries which in the past manufactured mainly for the home market aro being affectod by an increasing volume of imports.
       Take the case pf hosiery.   The outstanding feature of the figures for the last few years seems to be a rapidcontraction ef exports side by side with a formidable increasein import3.       Exports of stockings and hose.1927  Dozen pairs 5,338,660 pairs 64,004,0281929    &quot;     fi   4,611,133   &quot;   55,334,256193035   &quot;     &quot;   3,250,000   &quot;   39,000,000       Retained imports.1927  Dozen pali-3 4,030,531 pairs 43,966,9721929    &quot;     ,;   5,166,496   &quot;   01,997,9521930**   11     &quot;   7,000,000   11   84,000,000K1930 figures estimated on the basis of the returns for the first six months of the year.15.    It will be seen from those figures that since1927 our annual exports of hosiery have declined from63 million pairs to about 36 million pairs and our annualretained imports In the same period have Increased from 49million pairs to some 84 million palr3..   I am well aware that figures covering so short a period may be affectedby special factors and are not by themselves conclusive evidence of the need for a drastic change of policy.   Butthey do seem to mo to indicate a trend which we cannotoverlook in considering what our industrial policy shouldbe.   There were in mid June 16,395 persons unemployed in tho hosiery trade equal to 16.9;&apos;? of those employed inthe trade as compared with 6.7  a year ago, and on the face of It it soems probable that thoro are oven moreworkpeople unemployed in this trade as a result of the invasion of our home market by the foreigner than as aresult of a loss of export trade.
16,     Turning now to our present policy for  dealing  withthe unemployment situation.   During the last  few months  emphasishas heen laid mainly on the putting in hand  of public  works  to absorb the unemployed.   Two questions arise on  this aspect  ofour policy:-       (a) What are we doing at present?       (b) What more can be done?       Tho following table gives the fullest and most  up-to-date information available about schemes of work  approved since theGovernment came into office and tho oxtent. to  which these schemeshavo been commenced and tho number of persons  employed:-Approved at   end.Value ofschowes inoperation.Men employed  on sits.May  June  July m.   m,    m.May  June  July    May ru.   in.    m.Juneevelopmonttee.         26.6  32.5  33.7oymant Committee.  35.6.  38.5  41.7ry  ofcrt -Rqadsv3d  inPie.3d  forsemont, Prograimne,-d  Inle,A  for-ement. programme^gaos. d  for ement. 3.327,09.3.8.334,980   37,00010.0  10.2   9.0 3.4   3.5   4.112.0  12.2  18.0 3.8   4.2   5.9.&apos;..62.76.46.6   7,53.23.03,423,320   27,00058,500   64,000        estimated.7.       It will  bo  seen from,the above table that in May, 58,300 mensre  employed  on  the site on works assisted by the UnemploymentPants  Committee  and on roads,  and in June, 64,000,
It is usually assumed that a number equal to those employedon the site is employed indirectly.   On the basis of thatassumption the total number employed in May was 116,600 andin June 128,000.   These totals do not include personsemployed on works approved by the Home development committee.   Schemes to the value cf 9.3 m had been commencedby July but the actual amount spent by the end. of June on those schemes totalled  1,344,500 representing a volume ofemployment equal to about 5,000 man-years.18.       Broadly the figures show that at the end of July,after 14 months of office, schemes of work to the value of43 m are in operation and further schemes to the value of77 m have been approved,the total value of all schemes approvedbeing  120,000,000.   Month by month.new schemes will becoming into operation and additional workmen employed.   Bythe time Parliament reassembles the total number of men employed directly and indirectly on works assisted by theUnemployment Grants Committee and on roads will probably bein the region of 150,000.   This is in addition to the substantial number of persons who will no doubt be employedon schemes assisted by the Lewis Committee and othermiscellaneous works.19.       Can this rate of progress bo considered satisfactory?I confess that,  before I had an opportunity of investigatingmatters for myself, I thought that a great deal more couldbe done.    At first I was not satisfied that the view takenby the Ministry of Transport of the possibilities in thismatter was sufficiently optimistic-.   The report of Sir H.Maybury in May to the effect that 20 ra of woric additional tothe Ministry of Transport programme would be the maximum ofreally useful economic road work that could be undertaken and
 that,  even if the State provided all the money, such additional work could not he completed before 1934, surprised me.  After fully examining the position, I am satisfied that not much more is possible than is actually being done.    On 5th August a meeting was held at which the Minister of Transport, Sir Ii. Maybury, Sir John Anderson and his staff, were present with Mr. Lloyd George and his colleagues including Mr. Humphries, their roads expert.   The LiberalRoad Map was produced, as also that of the Ministry ofTransport,,   Mr. Lloyd George admitted not only that ourRoad Schemes included bis, but were in certain respectsmore comprehensive.  He agreed that, substantially the  onlypoint to decide was how many additional men could be employedbetween now and next March if all financial and legal difficulties were removed.   Sir H. Maybury was asked  toreport on that question.   A further meeting has been  held to-day, Monday,  August 18th, to receive his report,thegeneral purport of which is that there is little scops forthe further acceleration of works within the programmes atpresent approved - in fact he suggests that any spectacularintervention by the State at this date would retard ratherthan further progress;  that the only new works which  inany circumstances might usefully be undertaken would be those included within his original estimate of  20 millionmodified by the  fact that we subsequently increased provisionfor such works under our own programmes by some  10 million;and that, even if such additional works were put in hand at the sole cost of the State their value in terms of early employment would be negligible.    The results ofthis meeting are being.dealt with in a separatedocument.
Ml20.       It is interesting to compare the Annual Road Schemes1920/1921 to 1924/1925 with the programmes of the present government.   The schemes in the former case amounted inthe 5 years to 43-g m as compared to our Trunk Road and 5Year Programmes of 48-g-Sm.   The following table shows how much of each year&apos;s programme v/as completed in tho first and subsequent years -during which it was carried out.

This table shows that each year&apos;s programme  tookat least six years to complete and that the peak ofexpenditure on and employment provided by each scheme  wasreached in the second and third years from the date of starting.22.       The following calculations based on this  tableshow the amount of employment provided in each annualperiod, on the assumption that for every  1 million spenton road work 4,000 men are given employment directly and indirectly for a year:-                        Amount spent.

My general conclusion from a study of our publicworks programmes is that the correct policy for theGovernment is not to alter these programmes at this stageor to indulge in anything spectacular in the sphere ofpublic works by means of a large loan, but to concentrateas much as possible on getting schemes already approvedinto operation.  I do not think, for instance,  that very much more can be done in the sphere of road works than is already included in our programmes and in the search  for
 the unattainable  we  may  divert  effort from the really important  matter  - tho rapid  initiation of works already approved. 24.       If  tho  Government had only to face the records of former  Governments it would -jje  easy to prove that the record  of  the  present Government in its first year, in which approval has been  given to works of a value of some  120 million tor  the relief of unemployment, compares very favourably with that of any previous Government.   But when Parliament reassembles it will not be satisfied with sanctioned programmes of road development.  it will demand to  know what our policy  is for dealing with unemployment at the source.   The limitations of a policy of public works have already been pointed out in a document prepared by the Secretariat U.P.11(30).    All large schemes must of necessitybe  spread over a period of years with the result that however imposing the expenditure contemplated /their effect on  the present live register of unemployment must be slight. Moreover at best they only provide temporary employment and save in so far as they may help in some measure to put industry in a stronger competitive position by improving services such as transport and power,  they do little to strike at the permament  problem with which,as I  sec the situation,this country is faced.25.       Unemployment is an industrial  problem  and inmy view wo should be  prepared to recognise the  limitations ofa public works policy and to concentrate our main effort from now onwards on&apos;&apos;the &quot;-orking out of a  policy directly related to tho needs of industry  (using the term in its  widestsense to include agriculture)  and to be  prepared topresent a statement of our policy to Parliament  when itreassembles.
26.       The sort of questions on which I think decisions arerequired if we are to frame a satisfactory policy for dealingwith unemployment are the following:- A. Agriculture.           How far can we produce at home foodstuffs we nowimport?  We must at all costs do something to arrest the decline in the population employed in agriculture hut it may he that weare attaching undue importance to cereal production and. areallowing ourselves to he intimidated by the difficultiesof effective action in this field.  Can we not work outpractical schemes for raising our output of pig, poultryand dairy products?  Of pig and poultry products our outputat home meets a substantial proportion of our needs:nevertheless we import some  80 millions of these productsannually.  The expansion of home production so as tc meet all our needs would, necessarily be a slow process but if itcould be achieved it would probably provide permanent employment for over 100,000 persons. B . Industrial Reorganisation and Development.    1 *  aBi 0 industries.     Hew far ought the process of reorganisation in the basic industries to be speeded up?  The necessity for somereorganisation must I think be recognised if they are to hold their own in the world of to-day at all - the question is whatis the most appropriate machinery for securing this onorderly lines.  Is it sufficient to investigate the conditionsin an industry and reporfand then leave the remedies to be          .               japplied by those in the industry?  I am afraid we shall find that in some cases it is not.  Vihat then is to be- the stimulusapplied?  Is the present machinery for supervising schemes and for providing finance adequate?  Will reorganisationenable these industries to retain their home market where it iBnow threatened?
     2 * Other established&quot; 1ndustrie3 .          May we not be devoting our attention tooexclusively to the position of our basic industries??/e  should, I think, at the same time examine thepossibilities of the newer industries, e.g. motors,.rubber, electrical engineering, civil engineeringmachinery, mining machinery,  new metals, in order toascertain whether they could  not be  expanded both for  thehome market and. for export.   Are the financial and otherf aciliti es available for  the  expansion cf these industriesadequate to their needs?  There will he great scope forthe development of these  and.  other of our newer industries in  the world conditions likely to obtain in the near futurebut in this country some  of them seera to have lagged behind their competitors both in the home market and abroad.          &apos;&quot;e should, I think, also examine the position ofsuch industries as the hosiery industry,  why in thehosiery industry, for instance, are  we losing both our home and cur foreign markets? ^re some  of these smallerindustries in need of reorganisation on  the linesadmittedly required in the larger basic  industries?  If so,are the necessary financial facilities available and is thenecessary stimulus present?     ^ &apos; -Tew induatrie s;i .          Can we not work out schemes for the developmentof  new industries in this country/-, e.g.  the extraction of oil from coal by the process  of hydrogenation?     4 . General.     (a) Costs of service3 of indus t r y .         Is industry hampered by excessive charges for         general services, e ;.g. power, transport?  If  so,         &quot;hat are the factors causirg? these high charges         and can they be  reduced?
           (b)  Organiaation for  sale .               At home  -  can preference  for British-made               goods be strengthened by  propaganda in               this country?  Would an extension of               existing hire purchase facilities for               industrial machinery and  equipment be               desirable?               Abroad - are the  existing facilities of               the British financial  system adequate in the               face of world competition cr is  the               criticism  that we are  losing trade to other               nations by reason of the  more  favourable               credit trrms they are prepared to offer a               valid one?  If  so, can we not  devise new               facilities?          Is the export machinery of our industriesgenerally adequate?  If not,  cannot schemes  for improvingit in individual industries be prepared?  Can our trade propaganda be improved?          (On all questions arising under the head of          industrial reorganisation and development          I think we should carefully examine the          views recently put forward, by Major Attlee) .
          G*  Fiscal Policy.          If reduction of costs of production by reorganisation,modernisation,- etc., are not sufficient to enable certain industries to retain their h,me market, or If present fiscalconditions are unfavourable to tho&quot;expansion of certainestablished industries or the establishment of new ones,  oughtwe not to be prepared to consider a modification of our fiscal policy ?27.       This list of questions Is intended merely toindicate the sort of matters ^hich  should,, I think, he underconsideration as the basis of an Industrial policy by any organisation charges with responsibility for devising measuresto deal with the unemployment problem.   But whatever organ!sa-tion is entrusted with the work of formulating an industrial policy, It cannot proceed far In present circumstances along  thelines indicated above because they are immediately faced with questions of high policy on which only the Cabinet can give a lead.28.       &quot;hen Parliament reassembles, the Government will beexpected to declare some definite industrial policy.   No onereally believes that the unemployment problem can be solved by action along any single line; It is only by an attack ata large number of points that any impression can be made and unless we have a policy which indicates that we are preparedfor such an attack, I do not see what defence we shall hav^ inthe coming winter in Parliament.29.       It will be realised that results of any value alongmany of the lines indicated above could only be achieved in areasonable time with the full co-operation of all parties in industry and finance.   But I believe that the announcement ofa bold and determined industrial policy would secure us that support and I hope when the Cabinet meets we shall face the issues whioh the present industrial situation presents.  If wehave a policy it ghould be  declared.   If we have no big
constructive proposals to make we should say so.   In any cas-;no one will bo satisfied merely with a record of public worksschemesj  no matter how good that record may be-                     (Initialled)    V.H.18th August, 1930.13 -
