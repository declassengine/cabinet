THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1930.MOST SECRET.                                            Copy No.     53CP. 298  (30).                 TO  BE  KEPT  UNDER  LOCK  AND KEY.For the use of United Kingdom Representatives only.          Not circulated to the Dominions.CABINET.Imperial Conference, 1930, Agenda.        MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR                          DOMINION  AFFAIRS.    AS arranged  at the  Cabinet  meeting of the 6th August (Cabinet,  49 (30),Conclusion 2 (a)),  I give in this  memorandum a brief outline of the Agenda of theImperial Conference and of  the attitude which it  is proposed  that  the  UnitedKingdom representatives should  adopt  on  the various questions which  arise underthe different heads.    The position is set out in greater detail in the minutes of the Policv Committee,which have already been circulated to the  Cabinet (CP. 233 (30)  and&quot;233 (30) A);but it may be helpful to summarise the  conclusions reached  under  the several headsof the  agenda, referring under  each head to the relevant  passages of the PolicyCommittee Minutes.    The agenda is classified under three main headings:                I. Inter-Imperial  Relations.              II. Foreign Policy and Defence.            III. Economic  Questions.                        I. INTER-IMPERIAL RELATIONS.    1.  The Report of the Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation,1929* (6th meeting, items 2 and 3, and 10th meeting, item 3).    The object of the general  recommendations of the Report  is the removal ofcertain existing legal  disabilities on the authority of Dominion Parliaments underwhich they  are  placed  in a position of subordination to  the United  kingdom parliament.  The Report also recommended that the position of the  Crown shouldbe safeguarded by  a  &quot;Constitutional Convention&quot; that legislation affecting the succession to the Throne and the Royal Style and Titles should  require the assent of the Parliaments of  all the Dominions, as well as of the United Kingdom.  A bill has been drafted to give the necessary legal effect  to  the recommendations; the&quot; Convention &quot; relating to the Crown is, in accordance with those recommendations,recited therein in the preamble only.  It is proposed that this Bill should be brought before the Conference with a view to securing general  agreement  as to its terms,and also as to the  procedure to be  adopted with regard to its passage and cominginto operation.    I need not stress the importance pf the  issues involved,  of which I  think theCabinet are already sufficiently aware.  I would only say that I expect that some atany rate of the Dominions will attach the greatest importance to our full acceptanceof the recommendations.    2.  In addition to  the  general recommendations set out under 1, there arecertain special questions which arise out of the Report of the Conference.    (a)  Nationality (7th meeting, item 3, and Appendix  III;  see also  10th meeting,item 1, conclusion  (2)). The Report  raises the problem how best  to reconcile the                                  *  Cmd. 3479.      [21566]                                                         B
conception of the status of membership of one of the individual communities of theBritish Commonwealth (e.g., Canadian  &quot; nationality&quot;) with that of the commonstatus  possessed by members of all the individual  communities (i.e., what is nowtermed the status of a &quot;British subject &quot;).  The common status is at present defined by United Kingdom legislation, re-enacted by the Dominions (except the Irish FreeState); some of the  Dominions have already passed legislation  defining also, forcertain purposes, the categories of persons who are  &quot;nationals&quot; of that Dominion.It is proposed to endeavour to secure agreement at the Conference  to some method ofdealing with the problem which will ensure that the &quot;common status &quot;  may still beregarded as possessing  the characteristics of a nationality for international purposes,and  will  not be  superseded for these purposes  by  the  conception  of  separatenationality of  the individual  Dominions.  (This matter has not yet  been finallyconsidered by the Policy Committee.)    Under this head also arise certain questions connected  with the deportation ofand the issue of passports to British subjects (11th meeting, item 2,  and Appendix I).The  points at issue are matters more of  detailed administration  than  of constitu-tional  importance; it is proposed to endeavour to secure agreement in principle as towhich  part of the Commonwealth should receive a British subject  whom (a) anotherpart of the  Commonwealth, (b)  a foreign country, desires to deport.   It is also proposed to deal with  a minor question relating to the responsibility for  the issueof passports  to naturalised British subjects.     (b) Empire Tribunal (5th meeting, items 5, 6 and 7,  and Appendix). It isproposed to bring before the Conference a proposal  (which arises out of  a suggestion made,  though  not discussed in  detail, in the  Dominions  Legislation ConferenceReport) for  the establishment of a new Tribunal  for the settlement  of disputes between Members of the British Commonwealth.  The Tribunal would be an ad hocbody composed of members of  a panel which  would  be  constituted of persons nominated in equal numbers by  the United  Kingdom and  each of the Dominions.Its  jurisdiction would comprise  disputes,  arising  between Governments,  of  ajusticiable nature, i.e., (a) disputes similar to those which, if arising between foreigncountries, would fall within the scope of the Optional Clause of the Permanent Courtof International Justice;  (&amp;) disputes arising out of the special relationship betweenthe Members of the British Commonwealth;  it would not include disputes between individuals.     (c) Merchant  Shipping (6th meeting, item 1, and 11th meeting, item 6). TheDominion Legislation  Conference recommended,  in  addition to the  removal  ofexisting restrictions on the powers of Dominion  Parliaments to legislate on thesubject of Merchant Shipping (this part is dealt with under 1 above), that agreements should be made between the Members of the Commonwealth for the future regulationof merchant  shipping  in certain  respects.  A draft of a detailed  agreement to giveeffect to the recommendations of this Conference on this head  has  been drawn up asa basis for discussion,  and has been circulated to the Dominions with the intimation that it  does not  embody  the final  considered views  of  the   United  KingdomGovernment.     (d) Certain defence questions (see under II, 4 (e) below).     3. Matters affecting the Crown.     (a) Regency (7th  meeting, item 2, and Appendix II; 8th meeting,  items 24-26;10th meeting, item 9).     In order to avoid  for the future certain  doubts and difficulties which arose overthe  procedure  for the appointment of Counsellors of State on the occasion of theKing&apos;s  illness  in 1928,  it is proposed to seek  agreement to   the enactment  ofpermanent legislation  to provide in advance,  so far  as possible, automatic machinery to deal with the various emergencies which may arise from the ill-health or absenceof the Sovereign.     (b) Advice to the King  (6th meeting, item  4,  and Appendix;  7th  meeting, Appendix I; 8th meeting, items 1-23;  10th meeting, item 9).     The points arising under this head are : (i) What matters concerning the affairs of a Dominion should properly be submitted to the King personally rather than  to the  King&apos;s representative (the Governor-General); (ii)  by  what  channel  advice on such matters is to be tendered to the King; (iii) how can the tendering of divergent advice to the King be prevented.
     As regards (i), the matters at present submitted to the King appear, apart from matters affecting the King in his personal capacity or as the Fountain of Honour or the  Fountain of Justice, to  be  matters connected  with  the external affairs of the Dominions.  It is  proposed  to  proceed  on the basis  that these matters ought to continue to be submitted to the King personally,  though modifications in certain formal documents may well be required to make  clear the present constitutional position.   As regards (ii), it is proposed  to  endeavour  to secure that the normal channel should continue to be through United Kingdom Ministers,  subject only to special exceptions;  e.g., it is thought that a Dominion Prime Minister, if present in London, might reasonably claim to have direct access to the King; and it is likely that a claim will be made that, on certain subjects, advice should be submitted through the  Governor-General (e.g., the appointment of a new  Governor-General); on the other hand, it is proposed strongly to  deprecate any suggestion that Dominion High Commissioners in London, not being Cabinet Ministers, should be used as  a channel of approach.   As regards (iii), it is proposed to endeavour to secure the establishment of a principle that  any Government, before  tendering advice to the King on any matter, should give due consideration to its possible effect upon other Governments and, where any  other  Governments are likely to be interested, should take steps to inform them beforehand of its intentions.     (c) Appointment of Governors-General. This falls  under the general heading of Advice see (b)  above (see especially  8th  meeting, items 16-23).  It seems necessary to recognise that the ultimate responsibility for the  advice  tendered as to the appointment of  a  Governor-General  must rest  with  the Prime Minister of the Dominion  concerned.  - On the other  hand, it is proposed to endeavour  to secure agreement on the following points :      (a) As regards the position of the King            (i)  that  no name  should  be  formally  submitted without having  been               informally approved by His Majesty beforehand,         (ii)  that it is within His Majesty&apos;s right to reject  any names  suggested               informally, or to suggest another himself, and         (iii)  that there should be complete freedom of consultation and discussion               up  to  the point where a formal recommendation  is made  and               approved.     (b) As regards  His Majesty&apos;s  Governments other than that of  the  Dominion           primarily concerned that they should be enabled to express, informally,           their opinions as  regards  any nominee  who is at the time employed by           them or ordinarily resident in any of the territories for which they are           responsible.     There is also a subsidiary point.   It has  been the  practice to pay from United Kingdom  funds  passage allowances to  Governors-General  appointed from  this country.   It seems impossible to advocate  the continuance of  this practice  (which, incidentally, has been  questioned by the Public Accounts Committee) if there  is a general desire on the part of the Dominions that such expenses should, in future, be defrayed by the Government  concerned.     (d) Issue of Full Powers and (e) Issue  of Exequaturs to Consuls. These pointshave been expressly included at the instance of the Union Government.   They fall, atpresent, within the matters under (b) which are referred to the King personally,  andit is, as indicated above, proposed to proceed on the basis that they should continueso to be treated.    4.  The system  of Communication and Consultation in relation to foreign affairs(10th meeting, item 4). It is not proposed to suggest any change in principle in thesystem now in force.  This system involves that .    (1) any of His Majesty&apos;s Governments conducting  negotiations must  inform           the other Governments of His  Majesty and give them the opportunity of           expressing their views on its policy;    (2) any of His  Majesty&apos;s Governments, on receiving such information, should,           if it desires to express any views on the proposed policy, do so with reason-           able promptitude;    (3) none  of  His Majesty&apos;s Governments can commit any of the other Govern-           ments of His Majesty to active obligations without their definite assent.      [21566]                                                       B 2
On the other hand, experience has-shown that the working of this system is not sofully understood and put into practice in the Dominions as it is in this country.  Thedifficulties should,  it is hoped, tend to lessen in course of time; but it is proposed to urge the Dominions to give the earliest possible intimation (a) of any negotiationsthey may themselves contemplate; (b) of  any doubts or difficulties they may  feel inregard to negotiations entered on by the United Kingdom Government, so as to avoid the embarrassment caused if disputes arise between Members of the Commonwealthat a late stage in such negotiations.    5.  Channels  of Communications with foreign countries  (5th meeting, items13-14, and 10th meeting, item 6).  It is  proposed to suggest  that agreement shouldbe reached  as to the  categories  of  subjects  on  which  communication  betweenDominion Governments and foreign  Governments (where no separate Dominiondiplomatic representation exists) need not proceed through strict diplomatic channelsbut may be carried on by some less formal means (e.g., through foreign consuls in a dominion).    6.  Form of Commercial Treaties (7th meeting, item 5; 10th meeting, items and 8, and Appendix II; 11th meeting, item 3). A memorandum has been preparedfor circulation to the  Dominions setting out the present  position  under whichcommercial treaties negotiated between the United Kingdom and foreign countriesnormally contain  clauses  (i)  securing benefits  for  all British subjects without distinction of origin; (ii)  giving Dominions the right to accede to the treaty; (iii)providing that Dominions may without accession secure the benefit of most-favoured-nation treatment for their goods, so long as they grant such treatment to  goods ofthe foreign country concerned.  It is pointed out that objections have from time totime been raised to these  clauses both by particular foreign countries and also by certain  Dominions; it is proposed to ascertain from the Dominions whether or not they wish the clauses (ii) and  (iii) to be  retained in future, and, if either  policy is acceptable to all, to adopt it.  It is also proposed to urge that the Dominions should agree to the continuance of the present practice as regards (i),  and to  point out thedesirability of their adoption of a similar practice in any commercial treaties whichthey may negotiate.  It is also proposed to  ask the  Dominions to frame  suchcommercial  treaties  in  such a form as not to  preclude them from giving morefavourable treatment to other parts of the Commonwealth than to foreign countries.    7.  Inter se applicability of inter-governmental agreements (5th meeting, items-10). The view&apos;may be  put forward by  some Dominions that multilateral inter-national agreements of an inter-governmental character apply as a matter of courseas between any of His Majesty&apos;s Governments which are signatories thereto.   Thisis not the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United  Kingdom.   As, however,the chief practical objection to the acceptance of the view mentioned above lies in theacceptance of the  provision normally  appearing in such agreements that disputes arising therefrom  must  be brought before some international tribunal, it is  proposedto defer raising the question at the Conference pending agreement as to the establish-ment. of an inter-Imperial Tribunal as proposed under 2  (b) above.  If agreement isreached  as to such a Tribunal, it is proposed to suggest (without entering intotheoretical discussion of the principle involved) that there should be a specific inter-Imperial agreement that the provisions of  all such international agreements will beapplied inter-Imperially on condition of (i)  a general reservation substituting theinter-Imperial Tribunal  for  any  international  tribunal  provided  for  in the arbitration clause of the  agreement;  (ii) agreement  upon any special reservationswhich may be necessitated by the subject matter of the agreement (e.g., in regard totariffs or other forms of preference).     8.  Phraseology in official documents (5th meeting, items  15-16).-It is proposedto endeavour to secure general agreement to the  continued use of the phrase  HisBritannic Majesty &quot; in official documents  where a shortened version of the King&apos;title is required.     9.  Stattis of High Commissioners (7th meeting, item 4). The Union of SouthAfrica have circulated a proposal for raising the status and precedence of DominionHigh Commissioners in London.   The chief point of difficulty lies in their presentprecedence in relation to (a) foreign diplomatic representatives; (&amp;) United kingdom ministers.   It Would be most difficult to agree to any suggestion for  putting high commissioners on a level with foreign  diplomats.  But it is  thought that, if thematter  were pressed, it might be possible to submit to His Majesty a  proposal thatHigh Commissioners should be given a precedence on all occasions next to Secretarie
of State.  This would  involve placing them above certain members of the UnitedKingdom Cabinet, who at present have precedence below that of Secretaries of State.Certain  other suggestions have been considered by the Policy Committee  (e.g., thatHigh Commissioners should be ex- officio Privy Counsellors or that the title right honourable or Honourable should be attached to the office of High Commissioner):but, while no  decision has been taken, it  is not felt  that  the adoption of these suggestions would be desirable.     10.   Questions relating to Mandated Territories (11th meeting,  item 1). Thei Union of South Africa  have given notice of  their intention to raise certain points inconnection with the position  of mandated  territories (the question of sovereignty,the temporary  character of mandates,  and the conferment of British nationality on non-indigenous inhabitants).   These points have given  rise in  the past to  somecontroversy between  the  Union Government and the Permanent Mandates Corn-mission.   It is not quite clear what  is the precise scope of the discussion  which theUnion Government contemplate on this subject; but it is felt that, in practice, thereshould be little difficulty in securing a general agreement on the attitude to be adoptedin the event of further  public discussion arising.                 II. -FOREIGN POLICY AND DEFENCE QUESTIONS.    1.  A general statement  in the  form of a  review of foreign affairs  will  be circulated to the Conference by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and this,with  any statements that may be  circulated by  the  Dominions,  will afford  anopportunity for the discussion of any particular  questions which it may be desiredto raise.    2.  There are two special questions which have formed the subject of discussion at previous Conferences and which  it appears desirable to bring up again at theforthcoming Conference, viz. :  (a)  New Hebrides, and (b) Polar questions.    Memoranda on these subjects are  in preparation  for circulation to the Con-ference but are  not  yet complete.   As regards  (a), it  is proposed  to discuss with australia and  New Zealand various alternatives as to the future of the Britishinterests in the group (see Cabinet 44 (30), Conclusion 5).  As regards (b), it  is not proposed  to raise any new questions of policy,  but rather to report progress; the memoranda will be mainly historical in character.    3.  The major subject for discussion will be policy  in relation to arbitration and Disarmament; but  the nature of the discussions at the Conference will clearlydepend, to a very large  extent, on developments during  the present Assembly of theLeague of Nations.   The main questions outstanding are the General Act for the pacific Settlement of International  disputes; the question of arbitration  arrange-ments with the United States of America; the proposed amendments to the covenant of the League of Nations, to bring it into harmony with the Paris Peace Pact; thedraft Disarmament Convention, and the ancillary Conventions such as the model treaty for  strengthening the means of preventing War, and the  Convention for financial Assistance to States threatened  with aggression.  Memoranda  dealingwith the history of the negotiations for the limitation of armaments (both naval, andmilitary and air) have been circulated to the Dominions.    4.  Defence questions: (a) Singapore base. A memorandum giving the historyof the base has  been circulated to the Dominions.  It is proposed to bring the matter up at the Conference and it is hoped to obtain a definite and permanent settlementof the questions of policy involved.    (b) Naval Policy. A memorandum by the Admiralty on this subject has been circulated to the  Dominions.  The principal point  arising for consideration at theConference  will no doubt be  the co-ordination  of  future building  programmes inharmony  with  the limitations imposed under the  London Naval  Treaty  of  1930,which apply to the British  Commonwealth of Nations  as a whole.    (c) Military Policy and    (d) Air questions. It is proposed to hold special  meetings at the War  Officeand Air Ministry respectively for the discussion of questions of a technical character,e.g., the organisation of supply arrangements, as to which a memorandum has alreadybeen circulated to the Dominions, and the interchange  of officers.   A memorandumon Air policy generally has also been circulated to the Dominions.
     (e) Defence  questions arising  out of the report of the Dominions Legislation Conference (see I, 2 (d) above).     (i) Discipline of Armed forces (11th meeting, item 4, and Appendix II). It is proposed to endeavour to secure agreement for the passage of reciprocal legislation providing (a) that forces of one Member of the Commonwealth, when visiting (or stationed in) another part of the Commonwealth, should be subject to their own code of internal discipline^ (b) that all necessary facilities to such visiting forces should be accorded by the civil power; (c)  that where so desired, facilities should be avail- able for the arrest and return of deserters.  The existing provision on  these heads depends on the operation throughout the Commonwealth  of  the respective  United Kingdom Acts (i.e., the Naval Discipline Act, and the Army and Air Force Acts). Under the general proposals resulting from the Dominions Legislation Conference no-immediate question arises as to the  Naval Discipline  Act; but in view of the annual re-enactment of the Army and Air Force Acts it will no longer be possible for these Acts to  have this Commonwealth-wide application.  It is regarded as of great importance that the legislation now proposed to deal with these matters should come into operation not later than the legislation  giving  effect  to the general proposals  of  the  Dominion Legislation  Conference.   The point is of practical importance in the Irish Free State where, under the Irish Agreement of 1921, certain forces are still maintained.    ^ (ii)  Prize Law and Procedure. This subject has not yet been considered by the Policy Committee; a memorandum is in preparation which will indicate the effect, on  the  present system  of Prize  Law, of the general  proposals of  the Dominion Legislation Conference and make suggestions for agreement with the Dominions as to future procedure.     6.   War  Graves. The drafts of the original charter of the Imperial War Graves Commission, and of successive amendments thereto, have been considered and approved at  Imperial  Conferences.   It is  now  desired  to  submit   a  further amendment,  which  is  understood  to be  generally  acceptable  to  the  respective Governments,  to the forthcoming  Conference  for approval.                          III. ECONOMIC QUESTIONS. 1. Inter-Imperial  Trade,  including:      (i)  General review of trade of Empire over a term of years and any matters arising  therefrom, including  Capital Investments and establishment of branch industries, the effect of successive tariff changes in its constituent parts and extent and  effect  of inter-Imperial tariff  preferences,  and  also  of  other factors, e.g., cartels, &amp;c.    It is anticipated that under this heading and under  (ii) below will arise themain discussion as to future  methods to be  employed for the promotion of inter-Imperial  trade.   So  far  there has been  no  detailed  consideration by  the  Policy Committee of the  problems involved under  either head.   I may, however, call attention to two documents which have been prepared in connection with (i), viz. :     (a)  A memorandum  for  the use of  United  Kingdom  Ministers, entitled:           &quot;Imperial Trade  Policy  and Imperial  Economic Machinery.&quot;  This           memorandum, which is being circulated to the Cabinet as CP. 304 (30),           discusses the relative spheres of  action  of  Governments  and of the           business communities and  analyses recent suggestions for  improvement           in Governmental organisation.    (b)  Statistical  tables*  for the use of the  Conference,  showing  imports and           exports in recent years  as between each of the principal  parts  of the           Empire, and                 (i) the rest of the Empire;               (ii) the U.S.A.;               (iii) other foreign countries.    The report  of the Committee of the Economic Advisory Council on empire trade should also  be  of much assistance.  This deals with the nature  of empire trade, the effects  of  tariff  preferences,  and  future  trade  relations  between  thiscountry and the Dominions, having regard to the position  of  this country vis-a-vis the  continent of Europe.
     It may be noted that specific mention of &apos;&apos; capital investments and the establish-ment of branch  industries,&quot;  and of &quot;the extent and effect of inter-Imperial tariff preferences,&quot; have been included  in  the  agenda  at  the  request  of  the  recentlydefeated Canadian Government.  No information has been  received  from Canada asto the precise points which  Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s Government wished to bring forward in connection with these items, nor&apos;as to whether Mr. bennett&apos;s government also attach importance to them.   (Similar considerations apply to those other itemson  the  agenda  which  are  mentioned  below  as proposed by the late canadian government.)     (ii) Bulk Purchase and  Price  Stabilisation.- These  questions  have  been included in the  agenda at the request  of the Government of the  Commonwealth ofAustralia, who have intimated that they will formulate specific proposals in respectof each of  them.  These proposals  have not yet been received.  In the meanwhile,two memoranda dealing with the general  considerations involved  (CP. 287  (30))have been prepared for the use of United Kingdom Ministers, but, as explained above,have not yet been  discussed by the Policy Committee.  A further  memorandumcommenting on the Australian proposals will be drawn up  when these are received.     (iii) The work of and any questions arising in connection with          (a) Imperial Economic Committee.         (b) Empire Marketing Board.         (c) Imperial Institute.     As to (a), the Imperial Conference will have before it  a short report. preparedby the Imperial Economic Committee on the conclusions which have emerged  fromits particular enquiries when considered together in the light of economic conditionsnow prevailing.   Sir H.  Mackinder,  the Chairman  of  the Imperial EconomicCommittee,  has intimated to  the  Prime  Minister his intention  of placing his resignation in respect of this Committee and of the Imperial Shipping Committee,as to which see 4 (ii) below, at the disposal of the Governments so that the questionof the future of these Committees may be discussed apart from his personal position.The Prime Minister has replied noting Sir Halford&apos;s intentions, and saying that itwill be  necessary to consult  the  other Prime  Ministers on the  subject when theConference meets.  The conclusion which the Conference reaches in  this matter will no doubt be affected by the conclusions arrived  at under I  (i) above with regard to.the future form of  inter-Imperial governmental machinery in the economic sphereand  the place  of  the Imperial  Economic Committee in that  machinery  (seeparagraph 18 of CP. 304 (30)).     As  to (b), the annual report of the Empire Marketing Board for the year endedMay 1930 has been  circulated as a memorandum^ for the Conference.   Apart fromthe question of the  possibility of the establishment of Empire Marketing Boards inthe Dominions as part of the inter-Imperial machinery resulting from the discussionsunder I (i) (see paragraphs 11 and 12 of CP. 304 (30)), a general discussion as to thefuture activities of  the Board is anticipated.  In this connection the question of themore extended  use  of films in the Board&apos;s work (see item 6 (i) below) is likelyto arise.     As  to  (c), a memorandum!  explaining the work  which is being  done by theImperial Institute  is being circulated to the Conference.   It is desired to securepromises of slightly increased contributions to the Institute from the Dominions andIndia, together  with, if possible, the participation of the  Irish Free State, whichhas not hitherto  supported the Institute.     (iv) Development  of Inter-Imperial Trade by  Trade Commissioner Services,Exhibition and  General Publicity. This  item  has  been included in the agenda atthe request of the late Canadian Government.   Briefs dealing generally with these methods of trade promotion  have been prepared for the use of  United kingdom ministers, but information as td&quot;the points, if any, which will be raised by the presentCanadian  Government is not yet available.   Inter-Imperial  co-operation  inexhibitions was recommended by the 1926 Conference, but it has been found difficultto give practical effect to this recommendation in the matter of exhibitions abroad,since where  in  such  cases the Dominions  and  the  United  Kingdom are  bothparticipating, it has been found that the Dominions have a strong preference forerecting their own pavilions.% E.E.

    (v)  Standardisation of the Form of Invoices and Certificates thereon.    (vi) Regulations  regarding Marks of  Origin. These two items have been included at the request of the New Zealand Government and the  late canadian government respectively; they  are technical in character and call  for no specialcomment.    (vii) Effect of increased Foreign Tariffs. This item was suggested by the NewZealand Government in  the form of &quot;concerted action to meet increased foreigntariffs,&quot; but the title has been modified  to that shown  above, in order  to avoidunfavourable reactions in foreign countries on the publication of the agenda.  Themain discussion under 1 (i) above will no doubt cover this point.2. Questions relating to Primary Production, including     (i)  Agriculture.        (a) Such questions as Imperial co-operation in matters of research and the    dissemination of intelligence among producers and otherwise, including matters    relating to the International Institute of Agriculture.Memoranda* on the work of the Imperial Agricultural Eesearch Conference, 1927,and on the growth of co-operation within the Empire in scientific agricultural research have been prepared for the use of the Imperial Conference and already circulated.  These memoranda  will enable the Conference to review the considerable progress which has recently been made in Imperial co-operation in this sphere.&quot; Itis proposed, also, to take advantage of the presence in this  country of speciallyqualified Dominion  advisers to arrange for the examination  of  certain  questionsfalling under  this head,  as a preliminary to  fuller  discussion at  the  ImperialAgricultural Research Conference,  1932.  It is understood that the Irish Free StateGovernment are likely to raise questions concerning the  improvement of agriculturalmarket intelligence,  and the possible formation of a joint  inter-CommonwealthBureau for the collection and dissemination of crop  and market reports.     The question of future policy with regard to the International Institute ofAgriculture at Rome,t will  also be considered by the Imperial Conference under this head  of the agenda.  The New Zealand Government wish to withdraw from participation in this Institute, but have agreed to defer action pending discussion of this subject at  the Conference.   The  view taken here is  that it would not be desirable to weaken  the status of the International Institute at the present time. It is hoped to secure that the discussion of matters relating to the Institute should take place some days before the Meeting of the General Assembly  of the Institute on the 14th October.         (b) Cotton growing in the Empire.     The Government of India has suggested the inclusion of this item, and will, it is understood, raise  questions concerning the effect of variations in prices on the cultivation of cotton.   A memorandum!  on the work done by the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation has been circulated for the use of the Conference.     (ii) Forestry The Resolutions of the Empire Forestry Conference, 1928.     The principal questions under this head concern the provision of funds for the support of the  Imperial Forestry Institute at Oxford,  and  preparations for the Imperial Forestry Conference  (South Africa) 1933.$      (iii) Minerals.          (a) The Work of Imperial Organisations in the Field.      A memorandum^ giving information as to the work of the Mineral Resources  Department of the Imperial Institute,  and also as to the meetings of the Empire  Mining and Metallurgical Congress, has been circulated for the use of the Conference.  The continuance of the work of the Mineral Resources Department is connected with  the question of the continued  support of the Imperial Institute by oversea Govern-  ments, as to which see under 1  (iii) (c) above.  The Congress is a private organisation,  which meets triennially in different parts of the Empire.               * B.E. (30) 5, B.E. (30) 15.               t E.E. (30) G.               j R.E.

         (b) Petroleum Production and Refining in the Empire.    This item has been included at the request of the New Zealand  Government.It is proposed to take advantage of the inclusion of this item to ask the conference to consider the possibility of increasing the number of oil refineries on British soil,and the  desirability  of continuing the policy of restricting the issue  of petroleumexploration licences and mining leases to British subjects.3. Research, Statistics, &amp;c. (not included above), including      (i) Meetings on Industrial Standardisation.    (ii) Meetings on Industrial Research.    Special arrangements have been made for United  Kingdom and Dominionexperts on these two subjects to  meet in  this country at the time  of the  mainConference.  The work of these two subjects will be complementary in many ways.The Standardisation meetings will consider the adoption throughout the Empire ofthe maximum of  standardised  items in industrial  production,  with a  view to increased trade and economy of production.   Great stress is laid on the importanceof this question in the Report* of the Committee of the Economic Advisory Councilon Empire trade.    The meetings on  research will  concern  broad questions  of  scientific policy,methods  of inter-Imperial  collaboration  and  awoidance of overlapping.   Con-sideration will also be given to such  matters  as the preservation and transport offood,  the development of mineral resources  and common standards of scientificmeasurement.  In  view of the special nature  of the discussions on research,  it isnot unlikely that no report  or formal recommendations  will be submitted to theImperial Conference on this subject.    (iii) Question  of convening a meeting of statisticians.    It had been  hoped to arrange for meetings of expert statisticians similar to the meetings on standardisation and research, referred to at (i) and (ii) above, in  orderto consider the progress made towards greater comparability  of  certain economicstatistics of various  parts of the  Empire,  on the lines recommended by the  1926Imperial  Conference,  and  the  possibility of  further action  in this direction.Difficulties in  releasing the necessary personnel in the Dominions in view of theforthcoming census of population have, however, prevented such meetings from being held during this Imperial Conference. It is hoped that the Conference may be ableto fix a suitable  later date for the meetings.    (iv)  Work of Oversea Mechanical Transport Council.    The Oversea Mechanical Transport Council is a body set up recently, on a basis which would permit of the representation of all parts of the Empire,  to investigateproblems connected with mechanical transport under oversea conditions, particularly the development of a road transport unit capable of carrying loads up to 100  tons.    It is desired to secure the participation of a number of Dominions which havenot agreed to  contribute towards  this work.   A field demonstration  will  be  givento show the results of the experimental work so far carried  out.4. Transport and Communications, including :     (i) Detailed recommendations in regard to Merchant Shipping of the  Con-         ference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation and  Merchant Shipping         Legislation.    The work involved here  will be the examination  of the proposed  agreement asto merchant shipping referred to under Inter-Imperial Relations, item 2 (c) above.    (ii)  Work of Imperial Shipping  Committee.    A progress report t showing the work done by this body since the  last ImperialConference will  be considered, and a decision will be required as  to  its continued existence.  The main discussions as to future inter-Imperial machinery under 1 (i)will no doubt bear on this point (see paragraphs 22, 24 and 25 of CP.  304 (30). Inthis connection it has to be borne in mind that Sir FI. Mackinder, who is Chairmanof this Committee as well as of the  Imperial Economic Committee,  will&apos; place his resignation at the disposal  of the  Governments.  If it is decided to continue theCommittee in existence but to accept  Sir Halford&apos;s resignation, it will be necessaryto appoint a successor.             * 0,1&apos;. 228 (30).                                t B.K (80; 21.       [21566]                                                          C
    (iii)  Survey of adequacy of the existing steamship  services.    This item was included at the request  of the late Canadian  Government, butit  is not known  whether they had any  particular points in view.   Meanwhile,information has been prepared for the use of United  Kingdom Ministers  showingthe regular steamship services between Canada and other parts of the Empire.    (iv)  Development of civil aviation in  the Empire.    A comprehensive memorandum^ will be circulated to the Conference to explain the results  which  have been achieved  in  this  country since the last ImperialConference in connection with oversea air routes, the  popularisation of flying andtechnical development in aviation.  Indications of present problems and the trend of future development will also be summarised in this  document.   It is anticipatedthat discussions  will take place as to  existing and prospective Inter-Imperialco-operation in the matters dealt with in the memorandum, and particularly as tothe air routes between the various parts of the Empire.  A field demonstration of thelatest types of aircraft will also be given.    No brief is being prepared for the use of United Kingdom Ministers, since it isnot proposed that the Government here should raise any  specific point.    (v) Cables and radio  communications, including commercial radio-telephony           and  broadcasting, with particular reference to  the desirability  of           providing a radio-telephonic transmission  station ca/pable  of communi-           cating with all parts of the Empire.    As  regards  the radio and  cable  services  now  operated by Imperial  and international  Communications,  Limited, a memorandum* for circulation to  theConference is being prepared by the Imperial Communications Advisory Committeewhich was established in 1928 in  relation to the new Merger  Company as the resultof the work of the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference of that year.  A general discussion on the results achieved by the Merger  Company is anticipated.    The questions of radio-telephony and the provision of a radio-telephonic trans-mission station to communicate with all parts of the Empire have been included in theagenda at the request of the New Zealand Government.  The discussion will probablycover the completion of arrangements whereby all the  Dominions and  India will beable to communicate by telephone with Great Britain and with one another.  TheConference will  also  be  informed of  the  position  reached  at   the  ColonialOffice  Conference this  summer in regard to the establishment of a  broadcastingstation in this country for  communication with the  Colonial  Empire  and  thepossibility of Dominion co-operation in such a scheme will no doubt arise.     (vi)  Postal Service rates.     (vii) News Services.     These items have been included at the request of the  late Canadian Government.The questions of Imperial Penny Postage, parcel post  rates, and the supply of news from British, as opposed to U.S.A., sources, are of importance to Canada, but no information is available as to the specific matters which will be raised by Canadaunder these heads.     (viii)  (a) Road construction and maintenance standards on  ton-mile or other                  basis;           (b) Standard roads, vehicles  and speeds recommended for various axle                  loads;           (c)  Desirability of  basing commercial vehicle taxation  on axle  loads;           (d)  Uniform road transport statistics.     These items have been inserted at the request of the New  Zealand Governmenton the ground that, in addition to advantages from the point of view of administra-tion, a general approval of standards under these heads suitable for types of motor vehicles   produced  by  British  manufacturers   would  increase  the  volume  of inter-Imperial trade.     These  questions are  of  a  technical  character  and  will  require  detailed examination by experts.                                   * Not roady.
5. Oversea Settlement.    An  historical  memorandum* has  been circulated  for  use at  the ImperialConference; and the occasion will be taken for a general review of the position,having regard, inter alia, to the recent marked  decline in the total of assistedmigration from this country to the Dominions.6. Miscellaneous, including     (i) Use of  cinematograph  films for  the  education  of producers  and  the           cultivation of markets  and for general  educational purposes.    A memorandum! describing the experience of the Empire Marketing Board inconnection with certain questions  which arise under  this head has been circulated for the use of the Conference.   It is thought that co-operation  between the  Boardand Dominion Governments on this subject might prove advantageous.   A brief hasbeen prepared for United Kingdom Ministers on the general educational aspect.    (ii) Avoidance of obstacles to  free entry of books,  periodicals, journals, &amp;c, in           the interests of knowledge and literature.    Except in the case of Canada, literature, as distinct from advertising matter,may at present be imported duty free into the various parts of  the Empire.  It isunderstood, however, that the imposition of a duty on printed  matter, other thanadvertisements, was recently contemplated  in Australia.  It is desired  to  obtain from the Imperial Conference a pronouncement in favour of the avoidance of suchobstacles.    (iii)  Reconsideration  of present arrangements for avoiding double taxation.    The  substantial effect of the arrangement at present in force with the Dominions(other  than the  Irish Free State) for the relief of  double income tax is that theUnited Kingdom bears the whole burden of the relief, since the Dominions  are notrequired  to give  any relief unless their income tax rate exceeds one-half  of theUnited Kingdom rate.  It is felt by the Treasury here that, although  there arearguments in favour of the present arrangement,  it  would be more equitable andadministratively  more  convenient if each  country  were reciprocally  to agree to refrain from taxing income which accrues to persons  resident in the other country.This is the system  at present in force between the United Kingdom and the IrishFree State. It seems doutbful, however, whether a proposal for the general adoptionof this system will be accepted,  since it would, in fact, involve  the transference ofthe cost of part of the relief from the United Kingdom to the Dominion Exchequers.    (iv)  Reciprocity in old age pensions.    This item  has been added  to the agenda at the  request of the  New zealand government.   This question was considered at the 1926  Conference with a view toreciprocal arrangements being made between the various  parts of the Empire in theinterests of migrants.  Action, so  far  as  this country is  concerned, to preventmigrants from suffering possible loss of pension, has been  taken by the passing of the widows, Orphans and Old Age Pensions Act, 1929, whereby pensions are payable in the Dominions at the expense of the United Kingdom Exchequer.    (v) Any matters arising out of the recommendations  of the 1926 Conference.    A printed statement:):  showing the action taken on the economic recommendationsof the 1926 Imperial Conference is  being circulated to the 1930 Conference.  It is not proposed that  the Government here should raise any  particular points on  this statement.    Sugar. The Secretary of State for  the Colonies has suggested that the questionof the  world sugar situation should be placed on the agenda of the Conference.  a brief is being prepared on this subject for the use of United Kingdom Ministers, andthe Policy Committee proposes to consider the question of raising the subject at theConference.                                                                    J. II. T.    Dominions Office, September 1930.o* E.E. (80) 14.f U.E. (30) 2.% E.E. (30) 17.
