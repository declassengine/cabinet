DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BrtlTAHaiO  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVEaflHKHT.88(50)  ,00PY HO.3 7                        0 A B I H E. T.                   EXPOP.T OP WAP. MATERIALS.      Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     The Board of Trade, as the licensing authority,  alwaysconsult the Service Departments and the Foreign Office inregard to any applications for licences for the exportationto foreign countries of substantial quantities of munitions.Except when objection is taken by one or other of theDepartments consulted, the Beard of Trade themselves issue the licences without question.  As regards the attitude of theother Departments, there are, of course, occasions when the exportation of munitions to particular destinations is eitherabsolutely stopped, or rigidly curtailed.  There have in thepast been at different times embargoes on the exportation ofmunitions to Turkey, to Hussia, and to China;  whilst notvery long ago, when there appeared to be a danger of an outbreak of war between Bolivia and Paraguay, restrictions were placed on the export of arms to Bolivia althoughoutstanding licences were not in fact withdrawn.  These areinstances of the general principle that munitions should notbe sent to foreign countries at times when the politicalhorizon is olouded, when there is a risk of the outbreak ofwar foreign or civil, and, cf cource, above all where there is any danger of the munitions being used against H.M. Forces.At the present time no such embargo is in force in respectof any foreign country, other than ex-enemy countries which by the Treaty of Peaoe are not allowed to Import munitions ofwar, and it is broadly speaking true that any firm whioh gets
a contract to export arms to any other foreign country can count on the issue of a licence for the purpose.     It has sometimes been suggested that our armament firmsnay fail to get foreign orders because they have  to tender,subject to their being able in due course to get  a licence,tfhereao firms in some other countries are not similarlyhampered.  The Board of Trade have no reason to believethat any substantial volume of orders has been lost forthis reason, espeoiaily in the present circumstances in regardto the issue of licences which are indicated above.     If ever t.he Arms Traffic International Convention is brought into force we shall be in any case under an obligationto maintain the licensing system.  The coming into force of thisConvention depends, of course, on it3 acceptance by a number ofother oountries, but -re could hardly refuse to give effect toit if the adhesion of those other oountries is secured.Moreover, even if it were decided to abandon the requirement of individual licences for the exportation of munitions it would still be inevitable that some restriction should be placedthereon if political conditions in foreign countries requiredit.Board of Trade,      7th August, 1930.
