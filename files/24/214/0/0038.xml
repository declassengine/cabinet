Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     With reference to Cabinet 46 (30), Conclusion 10,I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, copiesof my correspondence with Colonel Peel, Chairman of theExport Credits Advisory Committee.Board of Trade,   7th August, 1930.                                     Board of Trade.                                         30th July.  1930.Dear Colonel Peel,        The President has this morning discussed thequestion of export credits for Soviet Russia with hiscolleagues.   Unfortunately, he had to leave the office at once for an official engagement and could not write to you himself, and he has asked me to inform youimmediately of the view he and his colleagues take.   Hehas not been able to see this letter before its despatchbut I will telephone to you at once if he wishes to correct it in any respect.        The first point he wishes to make clear isthat the Government do not desire to interfere with
           the discretion of the Advisory Committee.    The Government           wish, however, to put before you and your  colleagues           certain considerations0   They feel tha,t each application           for crodit for the export of goods to Soviet Russia           should be examined on its merits, whatever- the period of           credit asked for;  and, if the Committee are satisfied as           to the merits of a particular application, the President           and his colleagues feel that credit might  bo extended for           a period of 18 months Instead of the present limit of one           year, or two years in such cases as those  in which at           present, owing to the date of shipment being six months           later than the giving of the guarantee, the real period           is IS months.                                    Yours sincerely,ol. The Hon.                      (Sgd). W. E. BROftN. Sidney Peel, C.B., D.8.O., T.D.                                              6-7, King William Street,                                                       S.C.4,                                                   31st July, 1930.           The Rt, Hon.. The President,             Board of Trade,                Great George Street,                      S.1.1,           Dear President,                        Your Private Secretary1 s letter  of the 30th           Instant about credits for Russia  was considered by the           Advisory Committee to the Export  Credits Guarantee           Department at a meeting held yesterday afternoon.                        ThevCOOTuittee have felt and still feel that           on the evidence before them it is extremely difficult           for  them to foresee  the probable  course of events in           Russia for an even shorter period than  eighteen months           ahead.   Having regard to the  six months period normally
allowed for shipment under the Department1s contracts,they have not therefore been prepared to recommend theguaranteeing cf payments involving more than twelvemonths credit from the date of shipment0          But if, as the Committee understand to bo thocase, the Government in the light of their knowledge ofthe political and economic situation in Russia, aresatisfied that in suitable cases the Department mightwithout undue risk give its guarantee in respect of a credit period of eighteen months from the dato of shipment(which would mean that business could be done coveringtwo years if the six months allowed for shipment beincluded) they would be prepared to consider on their merits applications involving the longer term.   They would,however, be disposed to recommend the extended period onlyin cases  in which the nature of the goods appeared to warrant such treatment, eag. in the case of some of theheavy industries.          They feel moreover that the amount of theDepartment&apos;s total commitments on Russia will have to be carefully watched.   Even now the amount of credits grantedto Russia under the Scheme are approaching dimensions whichmight be regarded as tantamount to the guaranteeing of  a loan to Russia,          Lastly, they point out that whatever limit is fixed for the Department&apos;s Russian liabilities, the shortertho crodit period the greater will be the amount ofbusiness that can be done within that limit.                       I am,                          Yours sincerely,                       (Sgd), Sidney Peel.
                                          BOARD OF TRADE.                                             1st August,  1930.   Dear. Colonel Peel,        Thank you for your letter of yesterday about  credits   for Russia.   If I may say so, I think that the Advisory   Committee have substantially interpreted the views of  the   Government, and I am glad to know that you will proceed   on this basis *   I shall, of course,  be keeping in touch   with any developments.        May I take the opportunity of expressing my   gratitude for the continuous assistance that you have  been   rendering the Government as Chairman of the Export Credits   Advisory Committee?                            Yours sincerely,                               (Sgd.)  WILLIAM GRAHAM.Col. The Hon.   Sidney Peel, C.B., D.S.O.,  T.D.
