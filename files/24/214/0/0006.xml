THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty  &apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1930.SECRET.                                                     Gopy No,   40CP.  256 (30).CABINET.THE GARRISON OE THE  SUDAN.                 REPORT  BY THE  SECRETARY  TO THE  TREASURY.     THE  Committee of  Imperial  Defence, at  their 249th Meeting,  held  on the14th July,  1930, agreed (Item 1) :-     (a) That the withdrawal of a complete infantry battalion from the Sudan was           not  practicable at the present  time, and that, therefore,  the problem           resolved itself into  whether  the permanent  infantry  garrison  of the           Sudan should be 1-j battalions, or, alternatively, 2 battalions.     (b) To request the  Secretary to the Treasury to consult with  Sir John  Maffey           and with representatives of all the Departments concerned, and to render           to the Cabinet, by Saturday, the 26th July, if possible, a report showing           the administrative and financial effects of each of the above  alternatives.    2.  In accordance with the Conclusion set forth in paragraph 1 (6) above, I haveconferred  with  Sir John Maffey,  the Permanent  Under-Secretary  for ForeignAffairs, the Director of Military Operations and Intelligence, War Office, and theChief of the Air  Staff; and we beg to  submit the following report :  CO	The garrison of the Sudan is at present distributed as follows :  		Name of Barracks.	Unit in Occupation.(a)	Khartoum (South) British Barracks	1 battalion.(6)	Khartoum North	1 battalion headquarters(o)		and 1 company.	Atbara ....	1 company.(d)	Said Pasha (Khartoum South) 		During winter	1 company.	During summer	.... 1 squadron, R.A.F.(e)	Gebeit 		During winter	.... 1 company.	During summer	.... 2 companies.(/) Khartoum,  adjoining Said Pasha (temporary      accommodation only)              During winter      ....      ....       ....   1 RAP. squadron.    4.  It is common ground that the RAP. must be provided as quickly as possible with permanent accommodation, the cost of which is estimated at nearly  100,000.Of this it is agreed that  75,000 should be undertaken immediately, while the restcan be spread over the next few years.    5.  This estimate, however, is based on the assumption that  the Army willsurrender Said Pasha barracks to the Air Force, and represents the cost of adaptingthose barracks to  Air  Force requirements.  If  Said  Pasha  were retained  by  theArmy, the cost of providing entirely new accommodation for the Squadron would bemuch greater than  100,000.       [21420]
     6.   The first essential therefore is that Said Pasha should be evacuated by theone company which now occupies it.  But there is no other accommodation in theSudan available for this company; it must therefore either be provided with entirely new accommodation, or be withdrawn elsewhere.     7.   To provide this company with new accommodation at Khartoum would costapproximately  50,000, a liability which the Sudan Government are naturally  most anxious to avoid, particularly as it is still uncertain how long the second  battalion, towhich this company belongs, will have to be retained in the Sudan.     8.   We  have  therefore  considered whether  it is  possible to  withdraw  this company from  the Sudan altogether, notwithstanding the administrative objections which the  War Office have hitherto felt, and still feel,  to  &quot; splitting &quot; a battalioninto smaller  units.  We are glad  to be able to report that this has  been found possible.  One company of one of the battalions stationed in Egypt is now quarteredin  Cyprus; and we understand that the Army -Council are prepared,  as a special arrangement,  to let  that company rejoin its headquarters  at  Moascar,  whereaccommodation is already available, and send one company from the Sudan to Cyprusin its place.     9.   This arrangement will  set free Said Pasha barracks immediately  for theoccupation of the R.A.F.; and we are informed that instructions have already  beensent to  Khartoum to commence  work on the buildings required by the  R.A.F., thecost of  which will be borne  by the Sudan  Government.   In addition, the sudan government have agreed, at the request of the Army Council, that, if the proposed arrangement  is approved, they will make certain alterations, at an estimated  costof approximately  10,000, in the accommodation at Gebeit, so as to enable a secondcompany and R.A.F. details  to be sent  there in rotation for relief during  the hotweather, in addition to the other company which will be permanently quarteredthere.     10.  The effect of this arrangement will be that      (a)  the garrison of the Sudan will be reduced, for the time being, to 1  squadron           R.A.F. and 2 battalions less 1 company.   Under present conditions we           are  satisfied that  this force  is sufficient for defence purposes;  while it           would be possible, in a crisis, to send back the  absent company without           the  political  reactions which  the despatch  of a full  battalion  would           involve;     (&amp;)  the garrison of Egypt will consist of the same number of battalions as before;           but one, which has hitherto been short of one company, will henceforth           be at full strength.   Here also we are of opinion that no political reaction           need be  feared.    11.   The proposed arrangement will save upwards of  50,000 capital expendi-ture,  and  is  satisfactory to all the Departments and interests concerned.  Werecommend it to the Cabinet for approval.                                          Signed on behalf of the  Conference:                                             N. F. WARREN FISHER.Treasury, S.W. 1, July 26,1930.
