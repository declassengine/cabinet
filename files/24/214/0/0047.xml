THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1930.SECRET.                                                    Copy No.  37CP. 295  (30).                                 CABINET.MILITARY  CONTRIBUTIONS BY  COLONIAL GOVERNMENTS.         MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR THE  COLONIES.    I UNDERSTAND that in the year 1927 the late Secretary of State  for Warcirculated a Memorandum to the Cabinet containing proposals for increased militarycontributions by Colonial and other  Governments.  That Memorandum was con-sidered by the Cabinet,  and a Committee was set up under the chairmanship ofLord Peel to examine and report on the proposals;  my predecessor was a memberof the  Committee, but owing to  absence he was unable to take  any part in its deliberations.  The recommendations of Lord Peel&apos;s Committee were, I understand,approved by the late Cabinet in December 1927, and my predecessor undertook toconsider and endeavour to give effect to its recommendations.    The matter has since formed the subject of correspondence between the ColonialOffice and certain Colonial Governors, and also between the Colonial Office, the WarOffice and the Treasury.   I think, therefore, that it will be of interest to the presentCabinet to know how matters now stand.    Lord Peel&apos;s Committee  submitted certain recommendations affecting (1)  theStraits Settlements, (2) Ceylon, (3) Malta, (4) Bermuda, (5) Jamaica, (6) Sierra Leoneand (7) the Channel Islands.    The question of the STRAITS SETTLEMENTS is involved with that of the SingaporeBase, and I cannot usefully say anything about it at the present time.    The question of  the CHANNEL ISLANDS is one for the Home Secretary and not for myself.    The Committee&apos;s proposals regarding SIERRA LEONE have been put into effect,and the responsibility for the defence of the important port of Freetown in  peacetime has  now been undertaken by the Government of Sierra Leone, the cost  being-shared  between  that Government and the Governments of the Gold Coast and nigeria.  This has resulted in a substantial saving to the Imperial Exchequer.    As regards  JAMAICA,  I  have been in semi-official correspondence with  theGovernor, and the  Secretary of State for War and the Chancellor of the Exchequerare, I understand,  in agreement with me that there  is no prospect of inducing theLegislature of Jamaica, which has financial control, to agree to  a contribution fromJamaica funds.    As regards CEYLON, the  Cabinet are aware that we have recently embarked ona somewhat ambitious constitutional experiment, and I am satisfied that  no  good,and possibly substantial harm, to the broad interests of the Empire, would be done if any attempt were made at the present time to induce the newly-formed Governmentof Ceylon to  increase the military contribution which  is at present made by the island.  I am, however, prepared to keep the matter in view and reopen the question at some later date if I see any prospect of doing so with success.    As regards MALTA, the Cabinet are aware that here, too, we have recently been involved in constitutional difficulties.  A time when the control of  affairs has hadto be taken  out of the hands  of the elected  representatives  of  the people andtemporarily administered under autocratic powers bestowed upon  the Governor is obviously hot a propitious one for effecting a transfer of financial burdens  from theImperial Exchequer to the exchequer of the Colony, but I am prepared to agree that      [21598]
 the Governor, in his capacity not as Governor but as General Officer Commanding, might be requested by the Army Council to take up the question whether it would be possible for an arrangement to be made by which the Maltese exchequer would forego the payments which are at present made to it by the Service Departments in respect cf drainage and roads, and also undertake the cost of certain services in connection with water supply and War Department roads which are at present borne by the Service Departments.     As regards BERMUDA, Lord PeeFs Committee&apos;s proposal was that the  Colonial Government  should be invited to make an annual  contribution of  12,500 a year in addition to the  3,450 a year now paid by the Colony as a war contribution.     The  Cabinet are perhaps  aware that the  Bermuda Legislature, which has financial control, bound the Colony by the Bermuda Imperial Defence Contributions Act, 1927, to make an  annual defence contribution at the rate of 2s. Qd. per head of population as from the date on which the war contribution ceased to be payable. On the basis of  present population, the annual contribution will be in the region of  3,750 a year, and there is no doubt that  the Legislature was  under the impression that in so doing it was making a  handsome contribution to  the cost of Imperial defence, particularly in view of the expenditure which, without any assistance from Naval funds, the  Colony has recently incurred for  dredging operations by which the Navy will considerably benefit.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that there is no prospect of inducing the Legislature to increase this contribution by 200 per cent., and that to make a proposal of this kind, which I have no constitutional power to enforce, would have undesirable political consequences.  I understand  that the Secretary of  State  for War and the Chancellor of the Exchequer are satisfied that this is the case.     A new proposal has, however,  been put forward  that it  might be possible to induce the Legislature to accept the whole or a greater proportion of the charges for the  Governors salary  and allowances, part of which  are at present borne by the Colonial Services Vote and Army funds, in recognition of the fact that the Governor is also General Officer  Commanding.     It seems to me, however,  that there is considerable danger in this suggestion. The Bermudas are a remote group of some 300 islands in the Western Atlantic, thetotal area of  which is estimated at 19 square miles.  The population is in the region of 30,000,  of whom 1,807 are electors.  The salary of the  Governor is at present  3.400 (of which  2,200 is paid from the Colonial Services vote and  1,200  from local funds),  together with  1,000 entertainment  allowance (of which  400 is paidby the War Office and  600 by the Colony).  If any suggestion is  made  that the Colony should accept the whole, or almost the whole, of the charge of the Governorssalary, it is probable that the counter-suggestion  would be made that the civil andmilitary functions of the post should be separated, that the salary of the governor should be reduced,  and that the post should cease to be held by a serving  military officer; and. indeed, it is difficult to reconcile with the principle of Economy of Force,which  is now, I understand, the second Principle of War (see Field Service  Regula-tions,  Volume 2, Chapter 1), the employment  of a senior Lieutenant-General  to command a part of the 1st Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, together with small detachments  of the Royal Engineers, Royal Corps of Signals, Royal ArmyService Corps, Royal Army Medical Corps, Royal Army Ordnance Corps and royal army  Pay Corps.  In these circumstances, I trust that the request for a further contribution from the Colony will not be pressed.     It is, of  course, no mere coincidence that in so many cases where the Secretaryof State for War has recently pressed for increased contributions the reply shouldhe that the Secretary of State for the Colonies has no constitutional power to securethem.  In  the case of  those Colonies and Protectorates (the vast majority) wherethe Secretary of State  has such power, steps were taken long ago to put the matternoon a proper footing.                                                                          P.     Colonial Office, August 28, 1930.
