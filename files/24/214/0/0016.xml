SECRET.INDIA :  Question cf the Participation of the Opposition Parties                            in the Conference.                From Secretary of State to Viceroy, lllh July 1930.   Private  and  personal.  Cabinet  are  actively considering the  question  of  the participation of  the Opposition  Parties  in  the Conference.  What  follows  is  asummary  of my  attempt to  formulate the pros  and cons, and  I should be  grateful for your comments at your earliest possible convenience.   The three-Party  truce in Indian  matters  J  understand to be  that  questions ofIndian policy are to be  free from subjection to the exigencies  of Party politics athome ;  that debates  on Indian policy should be  conducted in a non-partisan  manner,and that, for this purpose, information is to  be pooled  so  far as  possible  and freeconsultation take place between all Parties.   Pursuant to this understanding,  the  practice since 1919  has  been   for  theGovernment of the  day to consult the  Opposition or Oppositions on  high Indianquestions, the Government retaining unimpaired responsibility for deciding on theaction to  be taken.  The practice  has  never  gone  beyond consultation with theOpposition Parties, for it would  be constitutionally impossible  for the Governmentof the day  to accept responsibility for action resulting  from a policy imposed on it by the non-responsible Party  in Opposition.   The outstanding example of three-Party co-operation is  found in the composition of the Simon Commission.   Put  this body was purely consultative,  and when the proposition of three- Party co-operation is considered in  relation  to the  Pound-table conference an entirely new set of considerations has to be borne in mind.   For theConference  is to be definitive in  so far  as,  on agreement reached  at it, will  be founded the proposals which are subsequently to be laid  before Parliament; and  itis only the Government possessing executive  responsibility which  can  decide on theproposals  to be  submitted to Parliament.  Therefore,  when decisions have to  betaken at the Conference, the responsibility must rest with His. Mjjesty&apos;s  Government.If they  carry the Opposition with them, so much the better; but they cannot accord to Opposition  representatives what  amounts to the  executive function of taking adecision or  vetoing  a decision which would otherwise be  taken by  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.  In fact, the views of Opposition representatives would be liable to be over-ruled at the Conference.  Consequently, if the Oppositions are  represented atthe Conference they can only occupy an unofficial position.   The advantages of including them in such capacity would be :       (a) they would be forcibty educated at first haud as to Indian demands;     (b) they would  also be able to present forcibly to Indians opinions held by the         Oppositions ;     (c) to such extent as Indian representation of their claim convinced the Opposition         representatives present,  there would be corresponding promise that  these         demands would be accepted later by Parliament.   The disadvantages are that      (1) the  presentation of  Opposition  views in the Conference  would render         agreement  more difficult; and     (2) Indian leaders, foreseeing this difficulty, would be  deterred from attending         Conference.   This last difficulty  can, I think, only be  overcome if any announcement thatOpposition  Parties are to be represented at  the  Conference is accompanied  by a clear statement that Government, if convinced by the Indian  case, would not be deterred by disagreement of  the  Opposition members from proceeding  to lay beforeParliament  proposals based on agreement between  itself and Indians irrespective ofthe Opposition view.  This, I think, is  as far as Government  could  go, and would preserve the spirit  of the three-Party arrangement which  has prevailed till now inthe consultative sphere.4653    75  7.30&apos;
                           From Viceroy, lR7t July 1930.   Private and personal.   As  you  know, I Lave always  been  conscious of very  great  importance  ofsecuring the maximum co-operation  of  the  Opposition  Parties with Indian policy,and 1 hope that you -will find it possible to arrange  procedure by which  this may beeffected.   1 am not unaware of  the difficulties in the way.  To include  members ofthe Opposition Parties in the Conference  would  mean a substantial alteration of theoriginal announcement, and Indian  opinion  lias always anticipated the conference was to  be, as stated, between Mis Majesty&apos;s Government and Indians.  I think it saferto leave this idea in the minds of the  Indians  and to continue to let it  be understoodthat Conference would be  held  on this  basis.  At  present juncture, at any rate, itwould  be dangerous to  make any announcement to  the  effect  that the opposition parties were to be  included in the Conference, and it might have the effect of changingfor the worse the general political tone out here, which I think shows some signs of becoming more moderate.   2. But these dangers  and  difficulties do not  diminish my desire to  see  theOpposition Parties in some way brought in.  I have given a great deal of thought  asto what alternative courses are open to us to achieve the desired object of giving  theOpposition leaders opportunity of influencing, by themselves meeting Indian leaders.If they are not to be members of the  Conference as  such, the problem is how best to associate them with its work.   One  way of  doing this would   be  to  avoid any suggestion that  the Opposition  Parties  should  attend  the formal  meetings of  theConference,  but  to arrange  informal  meetings from time to time between  them andselected Indian delegates.   I do not think it would be difficult to convince the Indiansthat they have everything to gain by  meeting  the Opposition leaders in this way, andI think the  Opposition  leaders might themselves find  this a less  tedious  and more direct method  for their discussion than by attending the Conference itself.   It might even be a good  thing if some  kind  of  standing conference between  all  parties inEngland could go on, concurrently with the Indian Conference,  discussing at frequent intervals the  material which  emerges from  the latter.  If it  were possible  to  do something of this  sort,  it might be possible,  as  things  develop, to effect contact between the Round-Table Conference and members  of the Opposition.   3. As regards present tactics,  however, my strong feeling is  that you should  avoidmentioning  the  question at all.  I am certain that, at  this stage, it  would  be misunderstood  here and  would  do  harm.    I learn that  during present sessionapprehensions have been  expressed   by  certain Indians in the Lobb3^ on  this verymatter.  This feeling will be intensified by article in Sunday Times,  quoted  by Renter;that Opposition  are now pressing Government for  their inclusion in Conference.  Ican hardly doubt,  however, when Indians get home, they will  very soon realise thenecessity of getting in touch with other Parties in England.   My advice,  therefore,would  be  to  wait for  them to  arrive  in London,  and then  to  convince them ofadvantages of some such informal, but, from  your point of view, effective  procedure as I have outlined.  I hope very much that  you will  lie able to persuade opposition parties that this  method holds  out best promise of success.   My only  desire, asI know itis yours, is to see them associated in  Conference  in  a manner which  willpromise best hope of maximum agreement all round. -                From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 1 Oth July  1930.    Private  and personal.  Cabinet  this morning  considered  your telegram of the1-lth  July  in the light of the very strong  demand which  is being made here,even in the Times, for having members of  the  Oppositions as delegates at the round-Table Conference.   I gave it  as my view that the primary consideration in theCabinet decision should be what you thought of the Indian situation and the&apos; chances of the Conference.   The  CabinePs general  view  was  that  participation by theOppositions would be difficult  to avoid, and accordingly it  was decided  that thePrime Minister and I should discuss with leaders  of the Oppositions the  possibilityof meeting their demand on- the following lines - that, the Prime Minister,  in inviting the  representatiyes, of the Oppositions,  should make it quite explicit  that, failing-agreement all round, executive responsibility rested with the Government,  who alonecould  constitutionally  decide  what  proposals were subsequently  to  be laid  before
Parliament.  If  this were made clear in  a public invitation to the Oppositions, would it not overcome the Indian  fear  that participation of the Oppositions would not only make agreement at the Conference impossible but would render the whole proceedingsnugatory ?   I hope to be able to make sure that the Oppositions do  not put forward impossiblecandidates, among whom I should include any member of Statutory Commission.   If the plan set out above were followed, would it not have advantages from theIndian point of view ?  It would give an  opportunity for the Indian case to be pressedin the presence of the Oppositions, with the corresponding improvement of the chances of legislation in Parliament ?   Would you please tell me exactly what your view is ?  We are consulting leadersof the Oppositions again to-morrow afternoon, by which  time I hope  to have heard from you.   You may, of course, rely upon my support in any decision you make.                          From Viceroy, l$th July 1930.   Private and  personal.  I saw Jinnah this afternoon, who was greatly disturbed at the  reports  in  the  papers  of  any  decision being  made and  announced  now about  Opposition being formally  associated with the  Conference.   In  his  ownwords, he  thought that  any such  action would  be disastroxis.   Though he  fully appreciated necessity of carrying them along, he thought it would  not  be impossibleto get this  effected with general consent when  they get to London, but I  am certainthat, on the immediate point, he represents what would be general view now.                          From Viceroy, lltli July 1930.   Private and personal.   1. I took the opportunity this morning of speaking  confidentially  to  indian leaders  in  the Assembly, and they are all agreed that any announcement at this  stage of inclusion  of Opposition  members  in  the Conference, even on lines suggested inyour telegram, would produce the worst possible effect here.  In their view, havingregard to the terms of my statement last  year,  action would be regarded by the public as breach of faith on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and would arouse verygreat suspicion,  which might  very probably  wreck the  Conference.   I  have  hadtelegrams  from   different persons  also  expressing greatest  anxiety  in  regard tonewspaper reports on the matter.   Jayakar further said he had heard from Sapruto the effect that, if siick announcement  were  made, he thought it would be no  goodgoing on with their joint peace efforts.   They accordingly urged most strongly that nothing should be said at this stage.   2. On the other hand, they all realised the great desirability of establishing  close contact with Oppositions when they reached London, and Jinnah assured me hewould do his utmost to persuade the Conference to  invite their attendance.   Jayakaralso  said that he would do anything that he could to establish contact, though he was inclined to prefer more informal manner  of doing it.   3. They may  possibly exaggerate the  consequences of the  change  proposed  from indian point of view, but I can have no doubt at all that thej1- correctly interpret  whatthe public feeling would be about such  announcement  made now, and, strongly as I desire to see Oppositions brought into closest  and most effective touch possible, both with Indian  representatives and with work  of Conference, I am sure that statement-of their  inclusion, however cautiously worded,  made now, would greatly aggravatedifficulty of getting things  here back on to basis of greater confidence.   Moreover,I feel so certain that when you come to the  point, means formal or informal can befound of  keeping all British Parties in direct relation with  progress of discussions,that from my end I am bound earnestly  to deprecate precipitate action that might, sofar as Hindus are concerned, easily be disastrous. Moslems on  the whole wouldprobably  not mind so  much.   There are  some signs of  moderate Hindu opinionbeginning  to assert itself and this would  inevitably be thrown back.   4. I could not get hold  of leader of European group this morning, but have little doubt that from  Indian point  of  view, he would take same attitude.   I  see thatPresidents  of   European   Association,  Calcutta,   have  written  letter  to Timesdeprecating any change in  anticipated composition of Conference.
   5. I. realise  fully  the  difficulties  of  the  Party situation  at  home,  and  theGovernment, of  course,  must; decide, on wider  review of  all the  considerationsthan it is in my power or  province to make.   But  I thought it right to leave  you and the leaders of the Opposition Parties in no doubt of what would be the reactionshere, and. to make it plain that in  my view, after discussing the matter  with indian leaders, I should not anticipate any great difficulty in devising  means by which theOpposition  representatives could, later, be associated  with the business  without theimmediate and serious consecpiences to which! have felt bound 1o draw attention.   6. It is  difficult for anyone not in touch with  it, to  realise the  intense  suspicionto which  the Indian  public is at present  a victim.  I think that there are hopes ofgradually. overcoming this, and the last  10 clays has seen  a swing back to greatersanity.. It is a very delicate situation ; and any jolt now may easily upset the coach,which might not impossibly be riding more steadily in two or three months&apos;  time.
                 From Secretary of State to Viceroy, lSlh July 1930.    Private and personal.    I  have not consulted the Prime  Minister or the  Cabinet, and the  following isbased upon my talks with  Baldwin,  Reading, Wardlavv-Milne, Simon, and  Samuel,and is  the best contribution I can  make at the  moment to  help  in  solving  our difficulties.  I  am  afraid that the  suggestion you make of an informal association ata later stage of the  Opposition with the Conference  would be quite unacceptable tothem.   In view  of  the scene in  the House yesterday,  there is no responsible demand at the moment  for  a debate in  the  Commons, but Burnham may raise  the question in the Lords.  There is, however, a repeated and determined demand, in responsiblequarters,  for the participation  of the Opposition Parties in  the  Conference, and ifthis demand is  entirely refused  both Liberals  and Conservatives  might  unite  in extreme opposition.   They would  base  their  appeal  on  the so-called  all-Partytreatment of Indian affairs aud  plead  that  it was  inconsistent with the prestige ofthe House of Commons that a minority Party should be permitted,  alone,  to representthis country at the  Conference.    I quite understand the suspicions in the minds of Indians and their first reactionagainst,  the  present suggestion.   But  it  appears to  me,   looking  at it  entirely from  their  standpoint,  that there  are strong arguments in favour of three-Partyparticipation.   First,  I  am convinced, and  this  could be  made  clear,  that  the conservatives are really anxious to help,  and I do  not think they would supportthe demand for members of the Statutory Commission as delegates.  Further, thepresence of Opposition leaders  would  enable the Indians to plead their case face to face with  them, and to the  extent  to which  they could persuade  them would ensurethe passage of their demands through Parliament.  This is a very  important practical point for Indians.   On the  other hand, if  the Oppositions were excluded they wouldbe predisposed to look with antagonism on any  proposals coming from a Conferencein which they did not take part, and any Bill produced would  be  prejudiced gravelyin the Commons  and fatally in  the Lords.   Those are very important considerationsfor the  Indian delegates to weigh.    There is no intention  of &quot; opposing an all-Party  front to Indian  demand.&quot;   Onthe contrary, the presence of Opposition delegates, while it has considerable advantagesfor India, does not in any way  affect the freedom of the Government to base its proposals  upon agreement reached  between its  own  delegates  aud the indian representatives.   It seems  to  me  that the three-Party scheme  gives  the Indiansadvantages both ways.    What  Indians 1 have spoken to here agree with this view, and I believe unofficialfriends  are cabling to India pressing it.&quot;    The Government has promised  to  settle  the matter as sooa as possible, but  I myself welcome a few days&apos; grace  in order to enable  the Indians at your end to takewhat  I think would be a wiser view  of the situation.   If,  over  the  week end, you could give me for  my personal  guidance your opinion,  I should  be grateful, and  i will inform you later of the  progress of opinion in the Cabinet and with the opposition leaders.                          From Viceroy, 20th July 1930.   Private and personal.  Your private and personal telegram of the 18th instant.   1. I fully appreciate the difficulties you are  having, and I recognise that you mayhave to come to a settlement of them with an eye  rather to home opinion than toopinion out here.  I recognise,  of course, the immense advantage at your end of directassociation of the Opposition parties with the Conference, and 1 am as anxious  to seethis: association effected as anyone  else.   My  suggestions were,  therefore, very farfrom being intended as refusal of their request, for I was concerned to examine  meansof achieving what  we all desire  without  endangering  at this  moment basis of representative conference at this end.   2. I can only repeat that from the Indian end decision at this stage to announce the inclusion of Opposition parties will mean trouble.  All that 1 have heard during-the last two days supports this,  and  I understand that Jinnah is on the point ofissuing a statement to the effect that in such circumstances he may have to reconsiderhis decision to  go to the Conference.   Such an attitude is of course most unreasonable ;but it is unfortunately a fact.
   o. I have already put all the arguments in favour of inclusion to people here, but without shaking their view.  They will support it by saying that it  is a departure from the  plain terms of tuy statement of last year about His Majesty&apos;s Governmentinviting Indians to meet them viz. His Majesty&apos;s Government in conference, and itwall  be freely said that this was the first test of the willingness of your  Government to stand up  to the  Oppositions, and that  fact  of giving way  to  them  shows  that co-operating Indians were  wrong  to- suppose that, when it came to  more difficultdifferences of policy you would.hot give way again,  and so on.   4. I need hardly say that these  are not my views, but  they will certainly be thoseof many political leaders  and you  ought to know them.   I cannot predict the actualeffect in the long run on the Conference or who would actually run out.   But if  thelandslide  does in fact start it may not stop before it has done much damage.  And inany case I have no doubt that the general position here, which shows distinct signs ofimprovement, will be  again embittered, and that any  hope there may  be  of Congressbeing persuaded to be reasonable will almost certainly disappear.   5. I am afraid  this  is unhelpful,  but I am so certain of the danger you  run onthis  side  that  I am bound to bring it again to your notice as strongly as  I can.If after full consideration in the light of this situation Oppositions  insist and  youfeel  bound  to  agree  we must consider what can possibly  be done to minimise the damage.  I am hopeful from what  you say that you can get Indians at home to exertpublicly  what influence  they can  here, and  if you give us  as much notice aspossible of  such inevitable developments we will,  of course, do our best.  The best1 could suggest would be that you shoidd, if possible, as you proposed in an  earliertelegram, make it plain in  public statement that there was no intention of departingfroni the  basic character  of the Conference as declared in last  year&apos;s  statement to be between  your  Government and- Indians, since the constitutional responsibility for thedecision  upon which  agreement was possible must rest upon  the shoulders  of  theGovernment.  But that, in view of the desirability, having regard to the parliamentary situation, of affording the same opportunities to  the Oppositions to appreciate theIndian  case  as would  be available to His Majesty&apos;s Government, it had been decidedto invite  the Opposition representatives to attend the proceedings.
