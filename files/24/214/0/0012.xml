By  the Expiring Laws Continuance Act  of 1929 the    present Rent  Restriction  Acts were  continued  In force until the    25th December,  1930,  in England and Wales, and  until the    28th May,  1931,  in Scotland.   These Acts have  been prolonged    from year to  year by  the  annual Expiring Laws Continuance Acts    since the  25th  December,  1927 (and  28th May,  1928,  in Scotland)    at  which  date they would  otherwise  have lapsed, and It has been    customary for the Government  to make an announcement before the    end of each  summer session  as to  their Intention  for the  future.         2.    It  may be well  to begin this memorandum by  stating    in broad  outline what are the restrictions at present  In force. t       3.    The foundation of the present system  is the  Increase 0.    of Rent and Mortgage  Interest (Restrictions)  Act  of 1920.  This    Act applied to all houses whose rent or rateable  value  in 1914    did not exceed  105 in London,  90  in  Scotland  and   78  elsewhere,    and consequently included in its  scope all but  a  trifling    percentage of pre-war dwelling houses.  Houses erected since    2nd April, 1919, were expressly  excluded  from the operation  of    the Act.    The  essential provisions of the Act  are  (1)  to limit    the permitted increase of rent chargeable by landlords  to the    actual increase in rate charges payable by them over  the    charges payable in 1914,  together with an amount  equal  to 40%    of the net rent in 1914,  and (2)  to give  the bulk of  tenants,    (apart from agricultural labourers  in  farm  cottages)  practically    complete  security of tenure,  so long as they pay  these  rents.    The 1920 Act  was framed to  expire on 24th June, 1923.
 Act of     4.   The Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act,      1923, prolonged the duration of the 1920 Act until the      24th June, 1925.  Certain minor modifications were made,      mostly in favour of landlords, but the general code was in      the main unaltered with the exception of the tvio following      changes: -                (a) Provision was made for the decontrol of           individual houses.   Any  controlled house which           became vacant in the ordinary course of events on  or           after 31st July, 1923, passed out of the scope of           the Acts and future tenants thereof had no protection           under those Acts.   A house could also be decontrolled           if the landlord and tenant executed a lease or           agreement giving the tenant at least two years1           security of tenure.                (b) Provision was also made that when the           ordinary restrictions came to an end there should  be           a limited form of protection for a further period  of           5 years.   This was only  available for tenants of           houses which were still controlled when the ordinary           restrictions lapsed.  No  definite rights of tenure or           permitted increases of rent were laid down, but on any           application made by a landlord for an order for           possession, the court (i.e. the county court in most           cases) was to decide the  matter from the point of           view of the relative hardship to landlord and tenant           of refusing to grant or granting the order, an^ the           court could at the same time fix a fair and reasonable           rent.   To assist the courts in these functions the           Minister of Health was empowered to set ur &quot;reference           committees&quot; to whom the courts could remit rent           guestions.  The constitution and procedure of these           reference committees were left to be settled by           regulations to be made by the Minister of Health,           but it was enacted that the regulations could provide           for rent questions being  taken direct to the reference           committees by landlord and tenant (of a controlled           house ) by agreement. Act of     5.   By the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions1925.      Continuation) Act, 1925, the operation of the 1920 Act,      as amended by the 1923 Act, was continued in force until      the 25th December, 1927, and since that date there has  been,      as above stated, an annual prolongation by the Expiring      Laws Continuance Acts, and the present date of expiry   is,      in England and Wales, the 25th December, 1930.           6.   Accordingly the position is that if no action is      taken, the present restrictions will expire from the
*Q1c5 J. 25th  December next, and the limited, form of protection referred to in paragraph 4(b) of this memorandum will come into  operation in  their place.   As regards this limited form  of protection I would observe that Although the constitution of the proposed &quot;reference dommittees&quot; gives the appearance of setting up &quot;rent courts&quot;, the apparent resemblance is illusory for the following reasons -          (1)  Differences between landldrd and tenant      would normally have to go to the ordinary courts      of law before there was a reference boa &quot;reference      committee&quot;;          (2) Only tenants of houses controlled on 25th      December, 1930, have any rights under the scheme      and          (3) The  scheme only operates for 5 years, after      which all &quot;referenoe committees&quot; and any form of      protection would cease to exist,      7.   I think we shall all be agreed that it is impossible to contemplate the expiry of the present restrictions from Christmas next and the substitution for them  of the five years arrangement provided for by the Act of 1923.          Accordingly it is essential that we should take some  action,  and this can only be a further prolongation of this existing restrictions by the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill as in previous years,  or fresh ad hoo legislation which must be passed before Christmas.   Suoh legislation might either be in the form of previous SentActs,  i.e.  prolonging the period of operation of the mainAct of 1920 with such modifications as appear to be desirable to remove anomalies,  or it  might be more ambitious in scope and provide in place  of the present temporary codewith  its base in the pre-war period,  some new soheme for dealing with difficulties between landlord and tenant whichmight  be either temporary or.permanent.
           In passing,  I would remind my colleagues of the extreme  difficulty of  passing Rent Restriction measures through  the House.  Legislation on the subject is always highly contentious and takes up an inordinate amount of parliamentary time.     8.   There is another speoial aspect of Rent Restriction to which I should draw attention.   The Minister of Health has always been responsible for legislation on the subject, but the Linistry have no administrative duties  of any sort under the Aots and consequently there is no body of knowledge on which the Minister can draw to ascertain the exact position of affairs at any moment.   Suoh organised knowledge does not,  in fact, exist anywhere, and consequently each of the mainRent Restriction Acts has been preceded by a Committee of Inquiry and has followed in the main the recommendations of that Committee.   The last Committee was set up in July,  1923, and reported in February,  1923,  (Cmd, 1803), and the RentAct of 1923 was based on the  Majority Report of that Committee,   The Minority Report of that Committee signed by the two Labour M,P!s,  of the Committee shows the Labourviews held sit that time,     9,   The general scope of  the amendments desired by ourParty in the  Rent Restriction  Acts is fairly clear.   if in present circumstanoes we thought a general system of rent courts too  difficult  of attainment, we should,  at  all events,  I suppose,  increase the  security of tenure to tenants,  especially tenants of  tied cottages,  and put an end  to the decontrol provisions.   I have not  givenconsideration to  the  preciBs  form  which any such  amendmentsshould  take for  three reasons:
           (1).   I  think that. in view of the state of our,           programme and the contentious nature of. Rent           Restriction legislation it is impracticable to           attempt to pass  suoh legislation &quot;before Christmas.;;           every possible device of obstruation would be           employed bjr the  Opposition,, f or h-as my colleagues           are aware,., the hardships and anomalies are not all           on the  side of the tenant, and there la. a very           strong  and widely held yiew that restrictions           should  be relaxed, not increased.-;           (2)   It would -Jbe urged against any proposals,           and with justice., that to a large extent we were            legislating in the dark.;  and         .&apos;  (3,)   I  an of .opinion that the time has come           when  it is desirable that the whole problem of           the relations between landlord and tenant should           be explored, more particularly from the point of           view  of ascertaining whether this problem would           not be  better dealt with by the setting up of           rent  courts as soon as may be, either in          substitution for, or in addition to, the present          code  of restrictions.     10.   As regards the.second reason J have given inthe preceding paragraph &apos;it ,will not be amiss if I Indicateshortly the profound changes in the general situationsince the Report  of the.last Departmental Committee setup in 1922.     C a)  j&apos;he Epuslmg- 2itil?!&apos;iPE.*          &quot; here had been comparatively little building in the period between the Armistice and July, 1922, andthe housing-shortage was then still most acute.                          5.
 I.   !  I   !  ; !l      I 1              1                   *      94          At  the  end of May,  1930, however, the number of houses built  since  the Armistice was, in round figures,          With  State Assistance............. 950,000          Without State Assistance    ........ 540,000                                 Total......1,490,000          The average number  of new houses erected annually during each of  the  last five  years is just over 200,000.          It  is obvious that the position has radically changed since 1922,  in so far as housing shortage is regarded as a factor influencing Rent Restriction polioy.     (b)  The extent of decontrpl.          Bouses  over the limits of value laid down by the Rent Acts have never been controlled.  The number of such houses is comparatively insignificant and may be estimated at approximately  100,000 in England and Wales.          The one and a half  million houses which have been erected since  the 2nd April, 1919, have never been controlled.          Houses  whioh          (1) were  empty or in the occupation of owners          -   on 31st truly, 1923,          (2) have  &quot;become empty or in the occupation of             owners  since 31st July* 1923, or          (3) form  the subject of oertain leases or             agreements between landlord and tenant, are withdrawn from  the protection of the Acts, or &quot;decontrolled&quot;.          There  is no accurate information available  asto the total number of decontrolled houses, and only themost vague estimate is possible.   In framing such anestimate  it is to be observed that the process of decontrolis cumulative;  the tenant of a controlled house movingto a new  house means the dscontrol of the old house;   another
Of1930tenant of a controlled house moving into the house sodecontrolled will decontrol the house he oame from, andao on.   (A sub-tenant moving on in this way would notdecontrol a house).   This process has been going on forseven years.   It may well he therefore that the totalnumber of decontrolled houses is equal to, or exceeds, thenumber of newly erected houses.  If for the moment we assume the number of decontrolled houses to be 1,000,000we get the following contrasting pictures of the generalstate of affairs in 19S1 and in 1930.          controlled dwellings                 7,900,0001921          Uncontrolled (Above rent        )          dwellings    (limits     100,000)                       (Hew houses  30,000)      130,000                                      Total    6,030,000          controlled dwellings                 6,900,000          Uncontrolled          dwellings   (Above rent          )                      (limits       100,000)                      (New houses 1,490,000)                      (Decontrolled        )                      (houses     1,000,000)   3.590,000                                   Total       9,490,000(For the purpose of this rough estimate no account has beentaken of the number of houses whioh have become unfit forhabitation and have been demolished).          In 1921 only     of existing dwellings wereexoluded from the soope of the Rent Restriction Aots;   in1930 the corresponding percentage is probably over  5$.     (o)  The effect of decontrol.

In 1921 only l^f0 of existing dwellings wereexoluded from the scope of the rent Restriction Acts;   in1930 the corresponding percentage is probably over 25$.     (o)  The effect of decontrol.          The Ministry have no systematic knowledge of theaverage level of the rents of decontrolled houses  asoompared with the level of the corresponding controlledrents, but, as might be expected^ a considerable  number of complaints has been received regarding extortionate rents
 charged for individual decontrolled houses,  and there is a certain amount of information derived from Tenants&apos; Associations and Local Authorities who have  made some investigations in their own areas.   I will  instance the results of two suoh investigations. SUNDERLAin) TOWN OOOTCIL.    Th.3 Counoil have  appointed a Committee to inquire into rent complaints.    Up to  the 16th May, 1930,  detailed inquiries had been  made into 1,998 complaints,  and  of these it was found  that 337 related to decontrolled premises.  The Committee give lists of rents charged for certain decontrolled houses, and  the corresponding  controlled rent.  There is no sort of uniform inorease visible.    At one end of the soale there are  oases where  the present rent is 17/6d. per week, against a controlled rent  of 9/od. per week;   at the other  there are  oases where  the inorease  is only a few penoe a  week. In one  list dealing with  38 oases, the average of the  weekly rents at present charged  works out at ll/5d. per week,  while the  average of the  controlled rents works out at 8/5d.  per week, giving an  average inorease  of 3/- per  week or 36$. BIRMINGHAM.    In 1928,  the Birmingham .and District tenants  Federation supplied  figures  giving  the  decontrolled rents of 148  houses  in Birmingham.  The average  increase of the  decontrolled rents compared with  the controlled  rents was  48$.    It  is probably  relevant to point  out  however that the particular 148 houses  selected  can  only  be a very small percentage of  the total number of  houses decontrolled in Birmingham, and will hardly &quot;be a fair sample.  Generally speaking, it is dear that landlords have taken advantage of deoontrol to inorease rents, and that in  a certainproportion of cases those increases are exorbitant,
      (d)  Houses erected by Local Authorities, for.letti.ng.          The ereotion of houses for letting by LocalAuthorities has.jre suited in the creation^of what are ineffect new types of controlled Joouse-s.,- the control beingthe restriction attached, as a condition o:fr government subsidy, to the rents whioh the authority may charge.  Thereare four such types.   In the case of houses erected in replacement of those demolished under slum clearance schemes,the rents are fixed by the Local Authority with the approvalof my department.   In the case of houses erected under theHousing Act of 1923 (the &quot;Chamberlain&apos; Act) there are noconditions at all exoept those imposed in practice by theoircumstance that a Looal Authority in fixing the rentsgenerally have regard to the rents charged by them for similar houses erected under other sohemes.  The bulk of thehouses built for letting by Local Authorities have beenereoted under the Housing Act of 1919 (the Addison Act) andunder the Housing Act of 1924 (the Wheatley Act).   the rent conditions under these Acts are as follows:- Act.     Number of Houses.  Provisions as to RentChargeable.Aodiaon  1919.170,000Rents fixed by the LocalAuthority with the approval ofthe Minister.  The rents to bethe best rents whioh can reason-ably be obtained from the classesof tenant in the district for whom the houses were provided,regard being had to anysuperiority of such houses inaccommodation, construction and amenities as compared with housespreviously built in the district.Wheatley290,000Rents not subjeot to myapproval, but it is a statutorycondition of Exohequer grantthat the rents are not to exceedcurrent rents of pre-war housesunless this would entail anannual contribution from tie ratertowards the cost of the scheme,greater than a fiacea,..anoiinrS*
          In practice, in the great majority of cases the rents charged for houses erected under the Addison and Wheatley Acts are  in excess of the current rents of pre-war working class houses of anything like the same accommodation protected under the  Rent Restriction Acts.          In the Housing Bill now before Parliament it is proposed as a condition of Exchequer assistance that the rents of new houses provided in connection with slum improvements shal to a large extent be definitely lower than the rents of T/heatley houses.     11*   I have drawn attention to the conditions governing the  rents of municipal houses to show how much more complicated is the position now than in 1322,   At that period; for example, a reduction in the permitted increase of rent would have had onI one  direct effect, which would have been practically general throughoiit the country, a transfer of money from the landlord&apos;s pocket to the tenant&apos;a pocket.   A similar reduction now Would increase the disparity between the rents of controlled and decontrolled houses and would make the maintenance of the present rents of municipal houses extremely difficult.   Any reduction of these rents would add to the Exohequer&apos;s burden under the Addison scheme, would increase the rate charge under the  other schemes and might well affect the rate of future house building by local authorities.     12.   The Rent Restriction Acts originated in an emergency due to the War, and were temporary Acts framed expressly to meet that emergenoy.  As we get further away from the War period, they naturally become less and less adapted to  meet the current situation.   One SOIIODI of thought would say that, having served their purpose,  they should be allowed to lapse and nothing  should be put  in theirplaoe;  another sohool of thought would keep them in operation,modifying them if necessary,  and adding provisions for the
      setting up  of  rent-courts with power to..fix fair-end      reasonable  rents  for decontrolled houses;  another school      of thought  contemplates  that a new system of rent courts      should,  be set  up  to deal with all houses.           13.    The conclusion at whioh I have arrived is that      since the Parliamentary  situation compels us in any event      to proceed  this year by a simple prooess of prolongation      of the  existing statutes through the Expiring Laws      Continuance Act,  the proper course is for us to announce      before  the  House  rises that we propose to do so.and at the      same time to say  that we propose to follow the precedents      set to  us and  to  appoint a strong departmental committee      to examine  the whole question of rent restriction and make      recommendations for future policy to be embodied in      legislation as soon as may be.  If suoh a committee were set      up to begin work  in the autumn, its report should he available      in time to  enable us to consider fresh legislation and pass      it before the  25th of December, 1931, the date to which I      suggest the existing legislation should be prolonged.          14.   The enquiry of the committee would in practice      have to cover the whole field of rent restriction and its      terms of reference would be -          &quot;to enquire  into and report upon the present working           of the Rant Restriction Acts and whether any           modifications or amendments should be made in them&quot;.               House building without subsidy is now making a very      important contribution to the housing problem and I am     apprehensive of the psyohologioal effeot on the private     builder of open mention of rent courts in the terms of     referenoe.  Nevertheless it will be in the power of the     committee to consider the case for and against them and I      should include members who would see that It  is done.                                       (Initialled)   A.G.Ministry of Health.   22nd July, 1930.
