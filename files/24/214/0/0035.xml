(Circulated in accordance with Cabinet 38 (30), Conclusion 8.)                                 1. GENERAL.    1.  IN considering the answer to the question  &quot; What is wrong with BritishIndustry 1 &quot; I have thought it desirable to deal not  merely with  the specific  point,but also with various suggestions which have been made with the intention of improving  matters,  as  a  consideration  of  possible remedies is necessary  if thediagnosis of the disease is to be of any use.    In my opinion the general answer to the question is the slowness of adjustment of a highly civilised industrial community to  altered circumstances in a period of rapid economic change.  The fact that constant change in the direction of economic activity is a normal  feature in  an advanced  industrial  society  has  tended to beobscured by the facts of British industrial history.   During the nineteenth centuryour great staple industries, such as coal, cotton, wool, engineering and shipbuilding,and the great export trade in connection with tJhem,  were built up;  the importanceof their position in the national economy and  their long-continued prosperity, gave an impression of stability that was not warranted  by the facts of the situation.After the war British industry had to operate in a changed world.  New economicforces had evolved.  But the facts of  the  situation  were not  faced  by,&apos;&apos;those responsible for British industry.  Masters and men tended to have the delusion thattheir  troubles were only temporary and that some day there would be  a return topre-war  conditions.   The  policy of successive  Governments during  the  post-Avarperiod in dealing with unemployment on emergency lines,  has on the Avhole tended to foster this delusion.  The  individualism of the British industrialist, Avhich  in thepast had been largely responsible  for his success, and his conservatism, have madehim slower than his foreign rivals to recognise the need for collective action.    2.  There are four main  directions in which this attitude has hampered Britishindustry :     (a)  Failure to Recognise  Changed Demand.         For  instance, those  responsible for the coal industry failed  to recognise    that, owing to  the rivalry  of oil  and electricity,  the  market for  coal had    contracted  and  was  unlikely to expand, while new sources  of supply had    developed.  The coal owners continued to  proclaim that, Avith longer hours and    lower  wages, the old  markets for  raw coal would  be recaptured, instead of    concentrating on the developments  of by-products,  such as  motor fuel.  The    textile trades failed to recognise the change of demand from cotton,and wool to    silk, and allowed the new product  to be developed in the main in  other areas    tihan Lancashire and Yorkshire.   The cotton  trade  tried  to meet Avith old    methods  the competition encountered in Eastern markets.      [21476]  [21781]&apos;                                               B
     (b) Failure to Rationalise Production.         An examination of the various reports on  the coal,  cotton, and iron and \     steel industries, shows how slow  has been the  progress of rationalization     Proposals for  internal reorganization have  been refused  or delayed.   The     contrast with the very vigorous post-war reconstruction  of the iron and  steel -     industries on the Continent illustrates this point  very fully.   As the need foi     rationalization  of production is now generally recognized, it is unnecessary to     elaborate this point.     (c) The Failure to Rationalize Distribution.         The  most  striking defect of  British  industry  has  been the failure  tc     organise on up-to-date lines the marketing of British products, especially foi     export.   The report on the iron and steel trade shows German  and French     industries organised  as national units  and federated continentally.  They  have     Export Bureaux to deal collectively with external  trade.   The British iron and     steel trade was urged to do the like  in 1916, but  only made a beginning in 192S.     The deficiencies of  the cotton  trade in  this respect  are fully exposed  in the     recent report.  The coal trade,  apart from the Five Counties Scheme, has shown     the  same picture of British industrialists  by cut-throat competition ruining     their own trade.  With the exception of the chemical industry, which is closely     associated with foreign interests,  I  am  informed that there  is no British     industry  which deals with its export trade collectively.   British agriculture     shows a similar picture.  The  British farmer tries to compete as an individual     against  the  standardised  products   from  agricultural  countries,  such  as     Denmark.  The general impression  on  a  broad  review  is  that,  while the     importance of marketing is generally recognized, there has been extremely  little     endeavour to change  over  from obsolete methods.  British  industry,  in the     selling as in the producing process, is  hampered by the individualism and lack     of co-operation of its direction, which contrast with the mutual helpfulness of     American business men.     (d) Failure to Rationalize Credit.         It is to be noted that on the Continent the banks have taken an  important     part in stimulating  rationalization, whereas in  this country,  until recently, so     far from doing this,  the banks have tended by their action or inaction to delay     the necessary reform.  The closer association of the banks on the Continent  with     industry has led to their taking a  far  more active part in assisting the  export     trades by credits than is the case in this, country.                     ; -Why Adjustment has been  so Slow in this  Country.     3.  There are many reasons for this reluctance to reorganise and for the absenceof initiative in British industry, not all of which are attributable  to the  defects ofBritish business men :       (a) Perhaps most important is the steady fall in the price level duriiig the  post-           war period.  Falling prices  inevitably damp down enterprise; and this           not merely in the  rationalization of existing industries  but  in the           development of new projects.  At a time when it was necessary that there           should be  considerable changes in the  direction of  British  economic           activity,  so that contractions in one trade might  be offset by extensions           in others, the  abrupt return  to the gold standard and the steady process           of deflation led  to depression, lack of confidence and lack of enterprise.           It is not intended in this memorandum to discuss the various suggestions           that have been made in relation to this point and  the  one following.     (&amp;) Monetary policy  since the war  has been favourable to the &quot; rentier &quot; and           unfavourable  to  the   &quot;entrepreneur.&quot;  The  actual  burden  of   the           indebtedness of industry to capital has increased in this country, whereas           on the Continent  the period of post-war  inflation  resulted in virtual           extinction of  the burden of dead capital.     (c) The lack of confidence  caused  by falling prices has been enhanced  by the           uncertainty of markets.  The disturbances of the  war not only broke up           old established economic units, but  produced an exaggerated nationalism           which found vent in protective policy and high tariffs.   This phenomenon    ,,      is  not  confined  to the  Continent of Europe: it  is found  also  in the           Dominions and in India.
    (d) The new industries, as for instance motor-cars, in the development of which,           normally,  this country would have taken its full share, were exploited           by countries, such as the United States, less affected by the war, with the           result that considerable lee-way has to be made up.    (e) Certain psychological factors have made for depression and  lack of enter-           prise.  The existence of the heavy national debt  and its necessary con-           comitant, the high rate of taxation, has an effect on the mind greater than           the facts warrant.   The publication of unemployment figures makes the           present depression seem greater than  those of the past because it is more           correctly known.  The existence of  a party in  the State advocating           Protection delays internal reform in industry in favour of agitation for           external assistance.    (/) The more elaborate structure  of  communal provision for  social  interests           makes industry and labour less fluid than formerly.  For instance, at the           beginning of last century, when there were rapid changes in the location           of  industry, the factory  and a few rows of cheap houses were deemed           sufficient,  whereas   to-day,  in areas  where  industrial  extension  is           occurring, the provision of houses, schools, and  other amenities on the           modern scale tend to make the change-over slow.    (g) Unemployment insurance probably operates in the direction of retaining in           industry  business units which  should be squeezed out as  the burden of           keeping in being the necessary labour  force during a period of slump has           been to a large extent taken over by the community.    (h) Trade Union regulations also to  some degree restrict the  introduction of           new processes.  ie Effect of State Action.    4.  State action to assist industry has for the most part not been of such a nature   to  counteract the deficiency noted above.   Successive Governments have been so  minated by  the  urgent need  of doing something to meet the  immediate situation   the victims of industrial depression, that the  possibilities of conscious direction   industrial development have been lost sight of.  Conservative Governments, withI protectionist&quot; programme  suppressed for political reasons, and minority Labour  governments,  with Socialist measures in cold storage,  have acted in such a way as   foster the  delusion that, given time,  British industry will recover of its own  cord.  Such assistance as has been given has tended to be too general and to have icked specific direction.   The coal subsidy is the worst instance of assistance being iven  to industry  unconditionally, and from the point of view  of correcting what  as wrong must be  regarded  as money wasted.   Export credits and derating are eally  of the same nature, being essentially gifts to the industrialist without the motion of conditions of  reform.   There  have been some  instances of Government ction to the contrary effect.  The Electricity  Act is the outstanding example of a  oad plan of rationalization by statute, while the beet sugar industry  and the motor uties have been  effective attempts to foster new  and growing industries.   The  ational Mark scheme for Agriculture is an instance of stimulus given to industry  reform itself from within, while the Coal Bill is an attempt to enforce rationaliza-  on from without.  Despite these instances of control, the  general policy adopted  s been based on the assumption that what is wrong in British industry will be put  ght by British industrialists or by the play of natural forces.2. GENERAL POLICIES.   If what is wrong with British industry is a failure in adjustment, it is necessary consider how far various policies put forward are likely to provide the necessary?medy at the  present time.    There would appear to  be three main  policies :  Theist is that of laissez faire, i.e., the belief that industry is not the affair of the State,lit that it should be left to those engaged in it; the second is the policy of Protection,ith which is often allied the conception of a self-sufficient British Empire; thelird is the poliby of  the conscious direction of  industry in the interests of the immunity.                             (A.) Laissez Faire.   Apart from a few academic publicists, there is little support for a policy ofm-interference by  the  State in industrial affairs.   Business men, although     [21476]                                                        B 2
                                (C.) Protection.  .    The four main grounds on which the case for Protection is usually argued maybe met as follows :     (1) It  is suggested that in the interests of national security it is necessary to           increase the output of British agriculture, and to  a certain extent of           other  industries;  or, in general, lessen  our dependence upon export           trade in view of the uncertainty of future economic prospects.  However,           it is fallacious to imagine there is any near prospect of  a world food           shortage.  The price  of food relative  to  industrial produce has been           falling heavily during recent years, and there is every sign of a continued           world glut of staple  foods.   The argument  that we ought to be  less           dependent upon our export  trade  raises  more  general issues;  at the           present time we are becoming less dependent upon our export trade, for           quite a different reason.  That is that every year our receipts from over-           seas investments pay an increasing proportion of  the costs of our imports.           Whether or no this is in the long run desirable, there is no sign for years           of this country&apos;s finding itself in any way put to it to pay for  imports           unless it encourages overseas investment  to an  altogether extravagant           extent.    (2) It  is contended  that the  abnormal  foreign competition  to which  British           industry is at present subjected is neither healthful nor stimulating           because  of dumping,  export  bounties, low labour standards  abroad,           uncertainty of  incidence  of  tariffs,  and  consequent  enhancement  of           industrial  risks.  Spasmodic dumping is an evil,  though one not without           its advantages to consumers;  e.g., the west of England stockfarmer was           able to buy cheap cereals thanks to the dumping of oats and barley which           injured the arable farmers in England and Scotland.  Protest by  the           British Government is rendered  difficult by the practice of some of our theoretically opposed to State  intervention and resisting attempts to control their activities, clamour for State assistance  for  themselves.  The idea that  without thought or intention the economic affairs of the human race will settle themselves is redolent  of  mid-nineteenth  century optimism, and is unsupported by the facts of the industrial situation to-day.   If the diagnosis of the ailments of British industry set out above is correct, and if any lesson is to be learnt  from the experience of the past ten years, it would seem that those responsible for British industry have proved incapable of so managing their affairs  as to promote the economic welfare of the community.                            (B.) Empire Free Trade.     The argument for Empire Free Trade is generally an extension of the case for Protection, but is based upon the conception of the British Empire as an economic unit.  But the accepted principle that  the Dominions have an unlimited right to establish their own industries and to dispose of their produce (which in many lines is more than Britain can absorb) in world markets, condemn any &quot; whole-hog &quot; policy of Empire Free Trade.  As regards  some partial form  of Empire Free  Trade, it does not  appear  necessary  to  state  the  objections to  a tariff on  food or  raw materials; the arguments are directed against the more plausible case for a duty on manufactured goods.     On this, two general points  may be  made.  First,  this  country&apos;s imports of manufactured  goods,  which have been rising in recent years, are yet in most cases at about the  same level as they were in 1913.  The figures  have been rising gradually from the  low level of the post-war years.  Secondly,  practically the whole of our imports of manufactures consist of goods  on which some further process of manu- facture is  to be undertaken,  such as  leather, semi-manufactured  steel.  No doubt these might  be produced in  this  country, but they must be counted as the  raw materials  of  the industries which  consume them, and any rise  in price would be a direct hindrance to British industry.  Thus this country has a large and growing export trade in tin-plates and galvanized sheets, which  are largely manufacturedby re-rolling cheap French and Belgian steel bars.  Again, any rise in the price of steel would &quot;promptly  react against the  shipbuilding industry.
           own  industries e.g.,  coal of  selling  exports  below  borne  prices.           Uncertainty is a  grave  drawback;  remedy is to be found rather in           Import Boards than a Tariff.               While some of our imports are made under lower labour standards           than ours, in  admitting them we neither endorse such  standards nor           suffer unfair competition,  any  more than  we do  from  the high-wage           imports of the United&apos; States of America.   Actual variations in wage           rates are due largely to varying geographical or economic  conditions and           the varying productivity of labour; if Japanese wage rates are   of ours,           the productivity  of  labour  in Japan  (owing  to lack  of  capital,           equipment, &amp;c.) is less than \ of British.    (3) It is  claimed that with Protection of the home market British industries           with a higher output could spread overhead charges and secure lower           costs of production: in general that  under the shelter of the tariff we           could  secure reorganization which  would  enable  British  industry to           supply the home market more cheaply and to go out and recapture export           trade.  If, however, it  is  possible  for  an industry so to organize  and           spread its overhead charges under the shelter of a tariff,  that it can, as           a result of that tariff, sell its produce at a definitely lower price, why is           it not possible  for industrialists to get together and effect this organiza-           tion under Free Trade ?  In so far as they  really can produce at lower           prices,  then prices would by themselves suffice to keep out the foreign           products.   The iron and steel industry admittedly has  high  overhead           costs due to a  low scale of  output; but, since 1924, under fierce foreign           competition, it has been increasing its efficiency, and output per worker           employed has gone up by 20 per cent.  No such improvement was observed           during the period of prosperity 1922-24, when the industry was virtually           protected  from  foreign  competition  by  the occupation  of the Ruhr.           Finally, an  industry organized as the steel industry claims it could be           organized under Protection (so as to reduce overhead costs  to a minimum)           might produce  steel at prices below the  present level,  but would it sell           at  these  prices except  for  export?   Such a  situation is a  positive           invitation to the industry to form a cartel of the most potent kind,           yielding some increase in productive  efficiency,  but  a very  considerable           increase in the price charged  to the  consumer.  When the complaint is           made that Germany is over-rationalized, it  is cartelization  of this kind           which is in view.    (4) It is argued that if this country were protectionist it would have a powerful           bargaining weapon with  which to secure tariff reductions elsewhere.               This point is illusory.   The World Economic Conference at Geneva           in  1927 categorically denied that the effect  of tariff wars was to bring           about any reduction in the general level  of tariffs, basing themselves on           the experience of recent happenings.  (See Final Report  of the Balfour           Committee.)    Two other points in this connection of ten escape notice.  The first is that if thiscountry became Protectionist we should be deprived in many markets of themost-favoured-nation treatment which we almost invariably enjoy.   Secondly, as  aresult of this most-favoured-nation  treatment,  if  at any time any  other  countrysecures any reduction of tariffs through  special bargaining, we can automaticallyparticipate in  it.    While it may be conceded that the conception of the British Empire as a self-contained economic unit has,  at any rate, the merit of considering  our industrial situation from a broad point of view, and while Protectionist policy involves to someextent  a definite conception of the economic  structure of the nation,  these policies,even if they were  possible, fail to deal with the particular deficiencies of Britishindustry in two important respects :     (-1) They disregard the principle which should underlie any policy in regard to           British industry,, namely, that it must be based on the preservation  and           enhancement of the standard of life of the workers.    (2) They  do not  provide  for any  effective influence being brought to  bear on           industry whereby it may be rationalized in the interests of efficiency  and           of the welfare  of the community.
         (D.) Deliberate Direction of the Economic  Life of the Nation.    The last policy  involves the  deliberate decision by the Government as to whatis the right basis for the economic life of this country and, when the decision hasbeen made, the utilisation  by the Government  of all  forces  at its  command  to implement the decision.  It is for the Government itself to decide as to how far  inthe condition of the modern world it is desirable or possible to depend to as greatan extent as formerly on our export trade.  If it is decided that the balance shouldbe redressed in  favour of a greater  production for home consumption,  it must  bedetermined what kind  of activity should be  stimulated.  These decisions must  become to with a view to utilising in  the best way the  economic resources of thiscountry in order that a high standard of life may be  maintained.   The question  ofthe optimum population that this country can carry is involved.  It  is clear thatthese decisions must be made before a definite policy on such matters as the location of industry, the degree of  assistance to be giv^n  to agriculture and the extent  towhich migration within the Empire should be stimulated can be decided.    But this is not an advocacy of  delaying action until  after  these  underlyingproblems have been decided.   Whether  it has a plan or not, the State must  of necessity be proceeding continuously with work on rationalisation of industry,  onrehousing of slum dwellers,  on new roads and on electrification.   Is a policy of driftbetter than an interim policy ?   Moreover,  when the above fundamental points aredecided, complete machinery will be required to make the national will effective; andthis machinery will have been naturally developed in the  handling of the  problemsdiscussed below.                 3. THE  ORGANISATION  OF THE  EXPORT  TRADE.    Up to the present efforts to assist the export trade  have been too general andhave been addressed more  to the possibility of a general expansion of trade or the securing of particular overseas orders than to the organisation of the  system  of marketing.  It would seem that one particular side  of  rationalisation  that needsspecial attention is a change in the method of the selling of British goods abroad.As has already been pointed out, our rivals tend in the direction of collective sellingagencies.   It should be possible to utilise such devices as export credits and tradefacilities  to induce  a better  organisation of export  on  the  part of  particular industries.  Railway  companies might be induced to give special  rebates to bulkconsignments  through selling agencies; in this respect British railways are hope-lessly behind  Continental practice.  Banks might co-operate in the  same way  by giving easier credit to those industries which were so organized.  There is evidencethat at present there is far too little co-operation between British sellers  abroad andthat the sale of goods that are complementary by different agents militates againstobtaining  orders.  There  would  seem to be no  reason  why particular industrialgroups such as clothing,  coal, cotton, wool, heavy iron, steel, machinery, pottery, &amp;c,should not organize collective selling agencies.   A corollary of this would seem to bethe proper organisation in each country where there is an actual or potential market for our goods of a British selling agency.  In each country there  should be  a trade commissioner  of high standing,  whose duty would be not merely  to give  generalreports with regard to british trade and its possibilities, but to act  as a focal point for the representatives  of the various selling agencies of British industries, theobject being to get all sellers of British goods to co-operate and be mutually helpful,so that information of an  opportunity  in one particular line coming to the notice ofa seller in another would be transmitted to the interested party.  The  memorandum submitted to the  British Cpnsul-General  at New York by Mr.  Maxwell  Magnus is interesting as showing the necessity for this organised system of selling abroad.                       4. RATIONALISATION  OF  INDUSTRY.     The policy of rationalisation in industry, which is accepted  by  all parties, hashitherto been regarded from too narrow a point of view.  It is considered as a matterof the organization of the production of British goods and their marketing in themost efficient way, and it seems to be considered that this is, in the  main, a matter which concerns  tlhose responsible for the particular undertakings.   On the other
hand, if the repercussions of rationalisation are considered,  it is clear that some-thing more than the efficient organisation of  a  particular  industry  is  involved.Rationalisation may result in grave loss to the Nation in both  personnel and wealth.The Memorandum of Mr. Bevin brings this out very clearly.  Rationalisation meansincreased unemployment for some persons, for some time, and the length of thisperiod is conditioned by the extent to which the industry is  expanding and to the degree of fluidity in the working population.  It means  very often the concentration of an industry in certain areas and the consequent  creation of communities withoutprospect of employment.  It is, for instance, probable that a thorough rationalisation of the  cotton  industry,  with the introduction of  modern  looms,  &amp;c,  and  the concentration of work in  the best equipped units of  the industry, would  reducecertain Lancashire towns to the position of some of the mining areas.    While it is necessary, if such industries as the cotton trade are to continue to exist, that they  should be carried out  in the most efficient way,  the process of rationalisation might entail an immense economic loss to the community, quite apartfrom  its results on the workers.   The social developments of the present  day have resulted  in sinking  a large amount of national capital in the shape of houses, roads,schools, drainage, &amp;c, which may be  lost if the industry contracts or changes  itslocation  without some other employment coming in to take its place.   At the sametime,  at great expense, new industrial areas elsewhere are being developed, where theentire communal provision for the citizens has to be created, while in general housing and other schemes,  being local, are pursued without reference to national planning.This is from the national point of view irrationalisation.    Rationalisation of  industry without external  stimulus is a slow  process,  and unless there is some agency to deal with its repercussions much suffering and wasteis involved.  It is  not  reasonable to  expect the industry which is in process of rationalisation to take up to any great extent the burden of looking after the workersdisplaced, still  less to take steps to introduce new  industries  into the areas affectedby the process; nor, indeed, would  it be good policy to try to place such an obligation on particular industries.   On the other hand, the  instances where communities,through  their local authorities or otherwise, have taken the initiative in endeavouringto introduce new industries in place of those declining  are few and  discouraging.                   5.- PLANNING OF INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.    It has now  become a commonplace that this country is at  present going through an industrial revolution, perhaps as extensive as that of the late  18th and early19th  centuries.   Its character will doubtless be clearer seen in retrospect than inprogress, but already it  is possible to indicate  its  main features.  Not only are welosing our position  as the world&apos;s workshop; to  a large extent  also this country itself is ceasing to require much of what it used to produce.  As the world  grows richerand more developed it inevitably requires less of steel rails and coarse  cotton-&apos;goods.In this country the whole tendency of new demand is for services  rather than forcommodities for distributive, catering, entertaining, public utility professional and  kindred services.   And within  the diminishing  sphere of manufacture  thetendency of demand, at any rate in this country, is for  specialities and  luxury goods of all kinds, apart from  one or  two heavy  industries, such as shipbuilding  and chemicals, in which the geographical compactness  of this country gives us peculiaradvantages.    This industrial transformation  has  its  geographical  counterpart,  which  isvisible to the dullest observer. New industry is streaming into the South of England,to the big cities, like Birmingham and  Manchester,  and  away from the industrialisedcountrysides of Lancashire and Durham but par excellence the tide  is flowing to greater London.     It seems that we are allowing to go derelict some of the best-equipped industrial areas in the world-the best equipped  from  the point  of  view of  fuel,  power,transport and labour supply. At the same time London and many other areas arebeing allowed to grow at an unprecedented pace.     This whole development is taking place entirely without plan  or  control fromany outside agency.  For the whole of  the past century we  have  been engaged in attempting to patch the  appalling defects created by , the unplanned career of, &quot;thelast industrial revolution.  And we are driven to confess that many of these problems,such  as the slums and overcrowding in big cities, are as yet&apos;only half-tackled.  Butat this present  moment we are standing by&apos; watching a similar industrial deyelop-ment heading straight for chaos.&apos;
    The social problems created by private enterprise are obvious  enough.   Whileit allows some areas to grow derelict, it causes others to grow at an unexampled anduncontrollable pace. Private enterprise, when it sets up its works at the place whereconsiderations of profit or perhaps merely of convenience dictate, is in effect calling upon the community to assist workers to migrate towards it, to provide  them withhouses, roads, schools and the complete net-work of local government services.  And,in addition, in London, and to  a less extent elsewhere, we are  daily increasing thegigantic cost and complexity of  the system of transport required to take the workers to and from their work.  Both in cost in money and in cost in leisure any avoidableincrease in transportation represents a dead loss to the community.    So far the situation has been viewed from its economic aspect alone, and nothinghas been  said  about the increasing congestion  caused by  uncontrolled  industrialdevelopment and the pushing ever further back of the countryside from the dwellersin the centres of cities.  This problem in  the case of London was bad  enough beforethe recent industrial developments had started, but it is now being made infinitelyworse.    It is necessary to lay down  principles on which any social control of industrialdevelopment  could  be  expected  to act.   In the first place, it must  be realised thatthere  are certain  industries  (though  only  a  limited number) whose position is absolutely decided  by the nature of their transportation  problems.  Thus, it iselementary that a blast furnace must be near supplies of coal and ore, and a shipyardnear to supplies of steel; in general, the location of industry  handling  heavy andbulky materials must be decided in the light of transport costs.  But in the case ofthe large and increasing body of industries dealing with lighter  materials, wheretransport costs a,re a very minor consideration,  much of  the drift  to the South ofEngland is quite simply in search of cheap and docile labour, or for convenience in marketing.  We are entitled to over-bear these considerations in view of the giganticdifficulties created  by  the leaving derelict of old-established industrial areas  withtheir population.    As a particular suggestion of an expanding industry which might be planted ina declining area, such  as Lancashire, we  may take the case of electrical appliances.The Government could well inaugurate a campaign for the more  rapid  spread inthe user of electricity; the Central Electricity Board is in process of  completing an elaborate scheme for the supply of electricity, but the present industrial depressionis likely to falsify the estimates made of increasing demand.   There is, however,considerable opportunity of extended user, especially in an increase of the domesticload.  On the general principle that the luxuries of one generation are the necessities of the  next one would expect that in  a  decade  or  so every family in this  country would be using the numerous electrical  appliances in the home which are now foundonly in well-to-do residences.  The obstacles in the way of a rapid increase of demandhave been the high cost of current and the  high cost of electrical appliances.  Theformer  has already been  taken  in  hand by  the Central  Electricity Board.   if government action in  co-operation with the trade could introduce the mass  produc-tion of  electrical appliances at  a low cost and at the same time could bring abouta big  campaign by the authorised undertakers for  their  user,  there  is little  doubtthat a very great development would take place. The very heavy fall in the priceof copper during this year indicates the presence of a good opportunity for further extension in this direction.    Town and regional plans, at any rate provisionally, have been worked out for thegreater part  of Great Britain.   For Greater London the work is in hand and  an interim report has been prepared.  The cardinal  feature of all these plans is that ineach district suitable  areas  are  set  aside  for industrial sites  after  thoroughconsideration of all the factors  involved provision  of transport facilities, nearnessof labour supply,  provision of power, adequacy of housing  accommodation andpreservation  of natural  amenities.  The  whole weight of industrial control shouldbe put behind the guidance of new industries into these sites rather than to elsewhere.For it is at best ingenuous to suppose that a single manufacturer is never shortsightedor that  he can hope to make as thorough a survey of the relevant factors as is madeby town-planning experts.                                                      ,    It is clear that a  very far-reaching co-ordination of governmental activities isrequired to carry through&apos; any such policy.   When  new functions were attached tothe post of Lord Privy Seal 12  months,&quot;.ago,  it was stated that it  would  be his task to co-ordinate the activities of all the departments concerned with industrialproblems.  But the implications of this declaration of policy have not yet been fullyworked out-and they are far-reaching.  Thus, it is  the  function  of  the Trade
hand, if the  repercussions of rationalisation  are considered,  it is clear that some-thing more than the efficient  organisation of  a  particular  industry  is  involved.Rationalisation may result in grave loss to the Nation in both  personnel and wealth.The Memorandum of Mr.  Bevin brings this out very clearly.  Rationalisation meansincreased unemployment  for some persons, for some time, and  the length of thisperiod is conditioned by the extent to which  the industry is  expanding and to the degree of fluidity in the working population.  It means very often the concentration of an industry in certain areas and the consequent  creation of communities withoutprospect of employment.   It is, for instance, probable that a thorough rationalisation of  the  cotton  industry,  with  the  introduction of  modern  looms,  &amp;e.,  and  the concentration of work in the  best equipped  units of  the industry, would  reducecertain Lancashire towns  to the position of some of the mining areas.    While it is necessary, if such industries  as the cotton trade are to continue to exist, that they should be carried out  in  the most efficient way, the process of rationalisation might entail an immense economic loss to the community, quite apartfrom  its results on the workers. The social developments of the present  day have resulted  in sinking a large amount of national capital in the shape of houses, roads,schools, drainage, &amp;c, which may be  lost if  the industry contracts or changes  itslocation  without some  other  employment coming in to take its place.   At the sametime,  at great expense,  new industrial areas elsewhere are being developed, where theentire communal provision for the citizens has to be created, while in general housing and other schemes, being  local, are pursued without reference to national planning.This is from the national point of view7 irrationalisation.    Rationalisation of industry without external  stimulus is a  slow  process,  and unless there is some agency to deal with its repercussions much suffering and wasteis involved.  It is  not reasonable  to  expect  the  industry which is in process of rationalisation to take up to any great extent the burden of looking after the workersdisplaced, still less to take steps to introduce new  industries  into the areas affectedby the process; nor, indeed, would it be good policy to try to place such an obligation on  particular industries.  On  the other hand, the instances where communities,through their local authorities or otherwise, have taken the initiative in endeavouringto introduce  new industries in place of those  declining  are few and discouraging.                  5. PLANNING OF INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.    It has now  become a  commonplace that this country is at  present going through an  industrial revolution, perhaps as extensive as that of the late 18th and early19th  centuries.  Its character will doubtless  be clearer seen in retrospect than inprogress, But already it  is possible to indicate  its  main features.

It seems that we are allowing to.go derelict some of the best-equipped industrial areas  in the world-the best equipped  from  the  point  of  view of  fuel,  power,transport and labour supply.  At the same time London and many other areas  arebeing allowed to grow at an unprecedented pace.     This whole development is taking place  entirely without plan or  control fromany outside  agency.  Por the whole of the past century we  have been engaged in attempting to patch the  appalling defects  created by ,the unplanned career of  thelast industrial revolution.  And we are driven  to confess that many of these problems,such as the slums a&apos;nd  overcrowding in big cities,  areas yet only half-tackled.  Butat  this present moment we are standing by watching a similar industrial develop-ment heading straight for chaos.
    The social problems created by private enterprise are obvious enough.   Whileit allows some areas to grow derelict, it causes others to grow at an unexampled anduncontrollable pace.

The obstacles in the way of a rapid increase of  demandhave been the high cost of current and the high cost of electrical  appliances.

The very heavy fall in the priceof copper during this year indicates the presence of a good opportunity for further extension in this direction.    Town and regional plans, at any rate provisionally, have been worked out for  thegreater part  of  Great Britain.   For Greater London the work is in hand  and an interim report has been prepared. The cardinal feature of all  these plans is that ineach  district suitable areas  are  set  aside  for industrial sites  after  thoroughconsideration of all the factors  involved provision  of transport facilities, nearnessof labour supply,  provision of power, adequacy of housing  accommodation andpreservation  of  natural amenities.  The whole weight of industrial control  shouldbe put behind the guidance of new industries into  these sites rather than to elsewhere.For it is at best ingenuous to suppose that a single manufacturer is never shortsightedor that he can hope to  make as thorough a survey of the relevant factors as is madeby town-planning experts.    It is clear that a  very far-reaching co-ordination of governmental activities isrequired to carry through any such policy.   When  new functions  were attached tothe post of Lorid Privy Seal 12  months ago, it  was stated that  it  would  be  his task to co-ordinate the activities of all the departments, concerned with industrialproblems.   But the implications of this declaration of policy have not yet been fullyWfirked out and they are far-reaching.  Thus, it is the  function  of the  Trade
 Facilities Act machinery to develop new industries but it falls upon the Ministry of Health to supervise the erection of houses, the Ministry of Transport the planning of roads, the Board of Education the erection of  schools.  It falls upon the town planning authorities to decide on the best sites for  industry, and for housing sites  but they have no power to call upon new industries to occupy the sites chosen.  It falls  upon municipalities to clear their congested central  areas and to  rehouse in their outer  areas.   Often, as has been  seen, there is a most incredible chaos arising out of the fact that one local authority rehouses in an  area subject to  the general local  administration of another  authority.  Again, it falls upon the  Ministry of Labour to transfer men from  decaying industrial areas;  but  it has no power to give credits for the setting-up  of new industries, or to arrange for the  building of new houses, in  the  expanding areas.     Clearly, it is no use suggesting an authority  which is to override  the depart- ments mentioned, which, through their Ministers,  have  to bear the responsibilities. But we can attempt to set up an  authority which can make recommendations on matters which  are at present the functions of existing  Government Departments, while it exercises full control over any new powers  which may be created.                            6. ECONOMIC STABILITY.    There is a need for endeavouring to secure  a  greater stability in the economic life of the nation.   The progress of rationalisation would do much to secure this, butactive measures are also necessary :     (a) The policy underlying the  proposals for a Wheat Import Board and the quota system is designed to secure the maintenance of a certain minimum amountof cereal cultivation in this country  on a profitable basis by securing a firm market.While this policy may be considered from  one point of view as only action in anemergency, from another it may be regarded as a considered policy of establishing acertain balance in the economic life of the community.  If it can be proved that itis desirable, for broad reasons of  social policy, that a  certain form  of economic activity should be stimulated in this way, there would seem to be no a priori objection,although the question of method must be considered.    (b)  The invasion  of  the British market by bounty-fed products from abroadwould seem to  demand a careful  consideration of our  treaty and international commitments, more especially a re-examination of  the exact meaning of the phrase &quot; goods of a like nature &quot; by the Law Officers of the Crown.    (c)  Every effort should be made to influence  demand in such a way as to give agreater stability to industry.   If the iron and steel trade were rationalised, it mightbe possible to make bulk contracts with the selling  agency of the trade on behalf ofGovernment, and possibly, also, local authorities, thus securing  a sure market for alarge bulk of production.  Constructional steel work and building materials generallysuggest themselves  as a possible subject for such  agreement.  If this were  done thetrade might be  secured that degree of stability in the home market which is plainlynecessary for successful operation in the export trade.   Regularity of consignmentsshould also secure considerable economies in railway and  shipping working.    (d)  The possibility of bulk contracts with Dominion Governments or organisa-tions  in  the Dominions, whereby bulk trading between the home country and theDominions would be effected, might be further explored.      7. THE METHOD OF RECONSTRUCTION:   RECOMMENDATIONS.If it be granted that (a) rationalization of production and of marketing at home and  for export is      economically necessary;(fe) it is not going to take place except slowly, incoherently, and at great social      cost, if industry is left to itself;(c) the process of industrial  reconstruction involves the deliberate planning of      the economic basis of the country, and demands the correlation of various      factors;   [21476]                                                          -
IPmuch required as is a sound general plan of- campaign.                          (A.)-minister of Industry.     What would seem to be required is a Minister and a Department rather, than a consultative body or a committee of Ministers.   The Economic Advisory ppunpilalready exists  with the power of suggesting large plans, but the essential thing isthe translation of ideas into  action.  Controlling principles of policy must in thelast resort be laid down by the  Cabinet,  but what is neecled is an executive arm, which,assisted  by the advice of  the Economic Advisory Council,  will express  policy&apos;&quot;inaction.   The country is face to face with an emergency like that of the war.  Thetask of the Minister would be tp lay down plans for national reconstruction and set in motion action upon them;  he would thus be the organ  of conscious  direction ofnational economic life.  As such he would of course, consult with and co-ordinate thework of other Departments, nptably Transport, Health, the Bqard/pf Trade and theMinistry  of Labour.  It would be his business tq see &quot;that rationalisation-in the widest sense-is  in fact carried out, tq plan it nationally, and see that it happensregionally.  It would&quot; be his&quot; business to safeguard the standard of life pf the workers and to secure that&apos;the economic advantages of rationalization accrue to the  com-munity and are not monopolised either  by individuals or groups.     The extent of the powers with which it would be necessary to arm  the minister is a matter for detailed consideration, but many of them exist but are dispersed andso comparatively ineffective.   In particular the power that resides in the credit ofthe Government should be made use of to induce industry to reform itself.   It isremarkable indeed that the immense  power of planning rationalisation, which isinherent  in the control of  the provision of credit for  industrial  reorganisation,should be in private hands (Bankers&apos;  Industrial Development Company).  One ofthe dangers of rationalization is the extent  to which private corporations are given power to monopolise certain branches of economic activity and appropriate the wholebenefits  of reorganisation,  and even more,  by raising prices against the consumer.One of the most effective means of? preventing this form of exploitation is the giving of power to insist on complete publication of&apos;accounts.                               (B.) Export Trade.      As suggested above, the main export trade of this country should be transferred  as rapidly as possible into the hands of selling agencies, one  for each  group of^ industries.  These organizations would be closely, interlocked with the developments  projected below.   They would provide organizations capable, of taking responsibility  on behalf of the industrialists in pach trade,  for allocating orders and promoting  specialisation and rationalization generally.                      (C.) Industrial Development Board.    For the stimulation of rationalization the Minister should set up an IndustrialDevelopment  Board  composed  of industrial  administrators, representatives  oforganized labour, and a minority of hankers with himself as Chairman; such board to have power to                      v    (a) guarantee overdrafts at the  Banks  for  definite or indefinite  periods for           replacements or extensions;    (b) take over and extend the Trade Facilities Act machinery for guaranteeing           issues of stock;
n(c) if found desirable to issue stock on its own responsibility;(d) to take over the existing Bankers&apos; Industrial Development Company;(e) take over the present Public Works Loans Board.In return for these advantages the Board would have  power to demand (1) amalgamation or co-operation with any other firm  if considered necessary;(2) the organisation of satisfactory selling agencies;(3) location of proposed  new works where the Minister may require;(4) the employment of transferred labour;(5) the return to the Board of full trading accounts, the Board to  have power      to conduct investigations through  its own accountants  and  to publish      information as it sees fit;(6) the employment by the firms or groups receiving assistance of  such means      of transport and power supply as may be required.    The Minister may be conceived as acting through particular bodies set up todeal with special tasks.  The suggested method of operation might be best explained by taking an example.   In the cotton trade, for example, it is generally admitted that nothing will be done until there is superimposed upon the various units of theindustry some co-ordinating body which will mobilise the goodwill and the -zeal for action of the more alert minds and enable them to coerce the recalcitrant, sleepy-minded or merely despairing others.  The  Minister, it is conceived, might set up a regional Board, the duty of which would be, first, to see that the Cotton report is put into execution, and, secondly, to deal with the problem presented by a countyhitherto predominantly dependent on one industry when that industry&apos;s market haslargely disappeared. The Board would have to see that a joint marketing organiza-tion for cotton goods of all kinds was created, a Raw Materials Pool set up andpressure brought to bear on sections of the trade,  such  as the dyers  and finishers,that are at  present acting inimically to the interests of the whole.   It  would also have to deal with the conditions of the workers under the new regime.  On the otherhand, it would have to survey the possibilities of new industrial developments, theextension of electrification, for instance, the possibilities of large-scale housing andtransport development.   In this instance the power  of the Minister might be largelyexercised through finance; the provision of easy credit facilities for the process of reconstruction and  for the introduction qf new industries into the area would give him considerable powers.  In other cases action might only be needed by some bodyset  up to deal with a particular industry.   How far the Minister w7orking through these  Boards  might find it  necessary to  have other means than that  of creditinducements, and how  far he would need to be  given coercive powers, would dependon the facts in each particular case.    It would be essential that where schemes of rationalization were  undertakenthe closest liaison  should  be kept with the Ministries  of Health, Transport andLabour.Effect on Employment.    8.   A  direct effect of a policy of rationalisation vigorously carried out on  thelines suggested would be the expansion of the national outlay on the maintenance and extension of capital, with a consequent demand for  the production of capital goods.   The underlying economic principles on which we should be working wouldbe the utilisation of a period of slack trade to re-equip ourselves for more efficientproduction in the  future.   This  policy would have a  considerable effect on  theunemployment position, and it would do it in the most economical way by employingpeople  in  their  own trades.   Thp  following figures will show the possibilities inthis direction.    The country&apos;s qutlay upon maintenance and extension of its fixed capital in 1929amounted  to some   606,000,000.   Perhaps  300,000,000 was required merely toreplace  obsolescence.   It is suggested that a vigorous policy on the part  of  theDevelopment Board, accompanied  by the guaranteeing of  credits, might  raise by       21476]                                  &apos;!

15 per cent,  the outlay under this head.  This would immediately provide direct employment for 245,000 men, as shown by the following table : Engineering  (including railway  engineering and maintenance)Electrical equipmentShipsBuildingContracting	Employment directlyEstimated	consequentOutlay	on a 15 per cent.in 1929.	rise in orders.(  million.)	(Thousands.)205	7156	2335	23195.1 115 J	128606	245    In addition, there would be employed in supplying materials for these industriesapproximately  170,000 men in all, of whom 50,000 would be in  the  coal industryand 20,000 in the iron and steel industry; thus  providing employment for  a totalof 415,000 in  all.  It will be seen that  this would at last be  really  making asubstantial impression upon the totals of unemployment.    With regard to the financial aspects of these proposals, it will be  seen from the suggested functions of the Development Board that some of the money  will be raisedby guaranteeing public flotations and  some by granting of additional credits fromthe banks; the  extent to which these two policies would be pursued would  depend upon  the situation at the time.  It may be objected that the latter would represent an undesirable expansion of credit leading to a rise in prices, but  this criticismcarries  less weight when it is remembered that this  expansion  of  credit  is alsoaccompanied by an increase in the output of goods.  Even assuming that the whole 90 millions, which an  expansion such as the above would cost, is  raised  in theform  of bank credits, clearly the extreme assumption, only a rise in prices of about per cent, at the end of  a year might be expected a much slower rise than the fallwhich prices are showing at present.  Thus at a time like the present, when prices are being  forced  catastrophically  downwards by shortage of credit and  by the unwillingness of private enterprise to make use of existing supplies,  the Board, byguaranteeing a big expansion of bank  advances, would be helping to stabilise prices and restore general confidence.  If,  on  the other hand, a time came when prices wererising and  bank  credit expanding the Board  would  use its powers to  restrictindustrial capitalisation to within the figure of the proceeds of true investment.  Infact,  so far from being a disturbing force, the Board would act  as a much-neededagent of stabilisation in finance and industry.SUMMARY.      1.  The general cause of the difficulties of British industry lies in its slowness of adjustment to economic changes affecting both home and world markets.  British industry has suffered worse than that, of other countries because of (a) our abruptr return to the gold standard and the policy of continued deflation; (b)  the innatei individualistic conservatism of British industrialists;  (c) our loss of leeway to the United States of America and other countries through the war;  (d) the failure of this country to learn from the experience of the  war;  (e) the growth of  industries, behind tariff shelters, in countries which used to purchase  from us; (/) the  depressing effect of a high national debt and rates of taxation;  (g) the inevitable reduction of the  fluidity of labour consequent upon growth of social services and trade union safeguards, in themselves highly desirable.      2.  Laissez-faire, the theoretical justification of Governmental inaction, with regard  to  industries  is completely discredited.   Effective Government action must take the form either of Protection or of the conscious  social  control of economic development.  State assistance to industry since the war,  including derating, export credits,  subsidies,  safeguarding,  has  all  been  unconditional,  and  splendid opportunities  have been  flung  away of securing  some measure  of  industrial reorganisation under public control.
    3.  The case for Protection is thoroughly examined on the four main grounds,(i) national security; (ii) the special arguments against abnormal competition, such.as dumping;  (iii) the possibility of Protection securing a greater spreading ofoverhead costs and. a general industrial reorganisation; (iv) the use of tariffs as a bargaining weapon.  On none of these considerations  am  I satisfied that thearguments for Protection are adequate.    4.  The proposals for closer economic unity with the  Empire are valuable onlyin so far as they recognize the realities of the situation. It must be recognized thatthe  Dominions   are  not  prepared  to sacrifice  their  nascent  industries  ininterests of  Great Britain, while we have no right to make the interests of otherparts of the Empire subservient to our own.  Neither can the importance of thetrade done by all parts of the  British  Empire with the outer world be neglected.The method of proceeding by tariffs seems the least likely to succeed.  Other methods,especially projects for bulk trading, should be fully explored.    5.  In the whole process of industrial rationalisation and reorganisation, andin the development  and proper organisation  of export  trading,  there is ampleevidence of the  enormous extent to which British industry has lagged behind its.^continental competitors.  Virtually in no sphere is there  any  effective co-operation for export between British manufacturers.    6.  We are now going through a period of economic change so rapid that itmay  be called a new industrial revolution.  The problems of housing, transport,labour migration and town-planning, which are being created,  are rapidly becomingoverwhelming.   The most closely interlocked co-ordination between several Govern-ment departments, together with considerable new powers for the State, are required.Every year  that these  problems are neglected further damage is done and our responsibility  to posterity grows greater.    7.  My  first proposal  is that a Minister of Industry, with a  staff includingexperts on labour, industrial management,  finance, transport and power, housing and town planning, shall  be appointed not merely to survey but to control thedevelopment of the nation&apos;s economic life. Its main executive arm will be the Boarddescribed below  (paragraph 9).  On matters, such as housing and transport, affectingother Departments of State, he will consult with and make recommendations to theMinisters concerned.    8.  His first task will be to form a series of export selling agencies for all themain  industries, which will eventually handle the whole export trade of  the country.Under the guidance of the  Minister these bodies should  secure export  orders andallocate these  to the works best fitted  to deal with them;  and hence  function  as general agencies for promoting industrial specialisation  and reorganisation.    9.  A Board of National Development should be set up, taking over the existingPublic Works Loans Commission and the Bankers Industrial Development Company.Its duty should be to  make  or guarantee loans to  industry in return for certain measures of public control, and  to stimulate the growth of  new industries.    10.  A year&apos;s vigorous application of the policy of expediting public works hasonlv  found employment for a limited number of men,  and that spread  over a termof years.  Even if the world depression had not come upon us last winter, we should only  have succeeded in making a  small reduction  in this summer&apos;s unemployment figures below those of 1929.  But a vigorous application of the policy outlined above should in a short period find work for some 400,000 men in  the vitally necessary workof industrial  re-equipment, and permanent work  for a larger total based on ih&amp;secure foundation of better organisation of industry and lower costs of production.                                                                    C.  R. A.2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,       July 29, 1930.
