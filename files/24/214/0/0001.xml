(THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY CF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT).       AGRICULTURAL POLICY - STATE ASSISTANCE       &apos; &apos;&quot;&quot;A &quot;  &apos;&quot;  &quot; 11 &apos; &quot;&apos;      ......&quot; &quot; &quot;......&apos;  &apos;i1,1,1,1   ..........  &apos;....... -.....            FOR ALLOTMENTS FOR UNEMPLOYED.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.         My colleagues will, I think, be interested in the    statement given below setting out a provisional estimate,    which has not yet b-oan discussed with the Treasury, of the     *    probable cost of certain proposals contained in my memorandum    on Agricultural policy (C.P.234(30)) for the provision of    allotment gardens and allotments for the unemployed.1. Allotment Gardens - provided by Local Authorities.         In paragraph 5 of Appendix IV. of CP.234 (30), I    recommended financial assistance from the State towards    the provision of allotment gardens, i.e. plots of 10 poles    in area for the unemployed.  The duty of providing these    allotment gardens for the unemployed should, I suggested,    be undertaken by the Local Authorities at present responsible    for the provision of allotment gardens.  In distressed    districts State assistance  Yfould be made available to make    up any deficiency due to the fact that the unemployed    worker may be unable to pay an economic rent.secret.P.251/50CABINET.

Ml                                        1932-33 .... 3,250                                        1933-34 .... 6,500                                        and on-                                        wards.          As regards credit assistance to the tenants to purchase seeds,  manures, and tools,this may be estimated at  2 per plot, or 30,000 to be repaid, in, say, two years with the rent.   It is to be expected that one half of thissura might prove to be irrecoverable, owing to          On the assumption that 1,000 acres ofallotments will he provided under this scheme,that Is,  enough for about 15,000 plots,  I estimate the expenditure to be as follows:-
       removals,  lack of means,  etc.,  in which case   the  Exchequer       contribution to loss would be  15,000.                 The advances would fall due for payment  as  to        3,75fl in 1932-33,  7,500 in 1933-34, and as  to  3,750 in       1934-35.   Any loss would  be repaid by the Exohoquer in the       succeeding year,  and  the irrecoverable amounts to be provided       would b*: -                           1953-.34 .  .   .   3,750                           1934-35 .  .      7,500                           1935-36 .  .   .   3,750.  Allotments - provided  by Minister.                 In paragraph 5  (v) of Appendix II of $CP.234 (30)  I       suggested the creation by the Minister  of allotments  averaging       half an acre in area for  the unemployed.  On the basis of        1,500 on land purchased  at  200 per acre and 500  on land leased,       I estimate that Ihe total capital cost  (including  equipment)       during the present and the next financial years, would bo        157,050  against  which rents in a normal year would amount  to        3,750.                 Loans for working capital for these unemployed workers       at  10 per man would require a further   20,00^ some of which       would I anticipate prove  to be irrecoverable.
