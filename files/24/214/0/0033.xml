Circulated by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.1.      In vie-;&apos; of the depression which e:riets in certain branches   of tho agricultural industry, an** the urgent nee?, for reform in   methods both of marketing and -irofluetion in order to take   advantage of our valuable home market, the Government have given   anxious consideration to the agricultural problem, with esneoial   regard to the desirability of increasing employment on the land.   with good standards of living, recognising that this can only bo   assures through nrosperity in the industry.                                             ; \2, Holdings for small Cultivators.        Proposals will be submitted? for making land more freely   available for small oultivators and affording them adequate   security of tenure.        Local Authorities will be stimulated to meet the large and   unsatisfied demand for small holdings, cottage holdings and   allotments.   In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture will be   given rowers to acquire and. manage land for these purposes, so   as to supplement but in no way to siip-plant  Local Authorities   that are active.   Powers to nrovide cottage holdings will be   oxtendoH to County Borough Councils and. these holdings will be   made available for letting as well as sale and for a wider class   of applicant.   Unemployment Scheme.        A scheme will he undertaken whereby a contribution may he   made to the mitigation of unemployment by the creation of a   special class of allotments ;md of market garden and poultry   holdings up to 5 acres for suitable unemployed workers, who will   also be provided with necessary initial capital.3, Large Scale Farming and Demonstration Farms,        An agricultural Land Utilisation Corporation will be
established to conduct large scale and demonstration farmenterprises under strictly business management andutilising modern machinery and methods-Scotland.     In Scotland, the Department of Agriculture will make every effort to increase the number of small holdingsavailable.   At the same time investigations will be set on foot fpr improving certain large tracts of barren land andreclamation works will be undertaken on the great FlandersMoss.Import Boards.      The question of Bulk Purchase and Import Boards willbe included in the subjects for discussion at theforthcoming Imperial Conference.Wheat.     In view of the critical position of cereal farming,and as an interim measure pending the development of others of a more permanent character, the Government has decided-tocreate a beard through the agency of which improved oralternative methods of cultivation may be encouraged, thestandard of labour on the land maintained or improved, andan assured market provided for home-grown wheat of goodmilling quality, either through the agency of an importboard or otherwise.Agricultural Marketing Bill.     It is an urgent necessity to give our home producersopportunities of orderly and  better marketing in our industrial market.     A Bill is being introduced forthwith for purposes of criticism and comment which offers certain powers to large-scale commodity organisations initiated by producersthemselves for the marketing of home-produced agricultural products and protects such organisations from the disruptiveaction of minorities.   There are precedents for legislation of a similar kind in overseas parts of the Empire.
                                                              242                                                              3.         The Bill contemplates organisations of two distinct    types, though combinations of both are possible.   First,    there is the older and better-known pool type which is  well    adapted for produots in respect of which we are largely self-    supporting, and of which the market may be disturbed by    recurring surpluses.   The Bill also provides for    organisations of tiie regulatory type which are concerned    more with the craft of marketing than with the physical    control and handling of the product, and which, after the    manner of a board of directors, would formulate a coherent    marketing policy for the home product and carry it into effect.         Financial assistance by way of both long and short    term loans will be available for these commodity marketing    boards *         Care has been taken to provide safeguards for the  great    body of consumers and for other afiected interests.    8.  Abattoirs *         The erection of publicly owned abattoirs by Local    Authoritias for the centralised slaughtering of livestock    will be encouraged..1.11* 9*   Education and Research.         The development of agricultural education will also form    an important part of our policy.   An Agricultural Research    Council Is being constituted to secure improved co-ordination    and extension of agricultural research throughout the United    Kingdom.   In view of tne great losses incurred through diseasej    among the first subjects to receive attention will be contagious    abortion, tuberculosis,  and swine fever.    10.   Sorub Bulls.         Legislation will be introduced to regulate the use and    Import of bulls, with a view to improving the standard  of  our    livestock.
   11. Agricultural Credi t.             Arrangements are under consideration for the        extension of the Agricultural Credits Act, 1928, to        Gco tland.IV. 12.  Th^Agrd oultura 1  orker.             Apart from the  increased provision for access to        land for their ocn cultivation that the policy affords        to suitable workers,  it is Important that agricultural        v/orkers should share in any added prosperity which may        accrue to the industry, and the working of the existing        machinery for regulating images will be carefully watohed        v/ith this object in view,    13.  Unemployment Insurance.                         ^_      .     &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;por some time the Government have been conducting        negotiations on the difficult question&apos; of unemployment    intention to include legislation on this subject in our    programme next session.14.  Housing.         The present Housing Bill contains provisions which    should mitigate the evil of the tie d cottage, to which    we attach great importance, and it is the intention of    the Government to take special steps to stimulate the    provision of improved housing in rural areas under the    poners therein provided.15.  Conclusion.         The &apos; Government is convinced that by a sustained and    well directed effort designed to evoke the co-operation    of the industry itself it should be possible to arrest    the decline of employment on the land and to foster, by    taking advantage of modern developments and facilitie s,    specialised and improved methods of production v.hich shouldrinsurance for agricultural v/orkers, and it is ourresult
