In Cabinet Conclusions 47(30)(5]i July 30th I was   requested to put  before my colleagues a more detailed scheme  for   dealing with maternal mortality, accompanied by particulars of cost,   the  scheme  to involve as small  an expenditure as possible by  the   State.            In approaching this matter, I have had to bear in mind   first of all what has previously happened in regard to it.    Basing   themselves  on the view that a proper public health value is not   obtained out of the money provided for maternity belief it jointly by   the  State,  employers, and employed, the National Health Insurance   Royal Commission  forecasted a scheme under which, while part  of  this   money continued to be paid in cash, part of it should be diverted   to assist in the  previsioa for  pregnant women of all necessary   services &quot;by midwife and doctor  during pregnancy and at and after   confinement *   The scheme then  was at its genesis a National  Health   Insurance soheme, but inasmuch  as the local authorities do so much   maternity work for the general  population, it was felt that the   actual carrying out of a maternity scheme must be put in their hands,   so  as to secure  its due correlation with their general maternity   and  child welfare services.   The same general principles have been   present in  various other published schemes for dealing with maternal   mortality to which I have referred in my earlier Cabinet Kemoranda   on this question.  Publiovdiscussion has proceeded on the same lines   and  also discussion in the kinistry with the Consultative Council of   Approved Societies. 60/9/30.                  -i&quot;
          In these ciroutastanoes,  I  have  felt  that  what  I must first do is to draw up in greater  detail  the heads  of a  sohemeembodying these principles,  adding such figures and forecast  ofapproximate cost as can be made in advance of  negotiations  withthe various interests.   The result  is set forth in the  appendix to this memorandum, and it will be seen that on certain statedassumptions the cost to the  Exchequer might be of the range ofone to one and a half million per  annum.          There are some difficulties about a  scheme of thisdescription which I ought to make  olear to my  colleagues.  they arise partly because it is an attempt to  join together in onesoheme two unrelated things, viz:  the health organisation oflocal authorities and the National Health Insurance Scheme, the basic principle of which is that the funds are the funds of approved Sooieties.   If money for such a soheme is to be diverted from these funds, Societies will expect for the insured population better provision than is made  for  the non-insured population, and provision which is a matter of definitecontractual obligation.   The soheme in- the appendix meets thesetwo point is but only by putting a definite duty on localauthorities (a position to which they usually object) and byoausing them to give a varying measure of advantage to the insuredand the non-insured (a conception unfamiliar to them and not likely to be very acceptable) .   This explanation will serve to illustrate the practical difficulties likely to be experienced in negotiating the soheme.   It  does not, however, exhaust them.The scheme will be violently  oontested by the Insurance Committeeswho will claim that it is preponderatingly an insuranoe medicalsoheme, the administration- of whioh should fall to them and notto the local authorities.   The British Ledioal Association will every   awerse from a position under which the Health Committee ofthe local authority, advised  by the Iiedical Officer of Health will
subject to the final authority of the Minister, have the task ofdisciplining those members of the profession who join the localpanel to work the scheme.   The Association will doubtless preferolaima to co-opted medioal representation on the Health Committeeto which the local authority will find it difficult to subscribe.And some weight must also be given to the reluctance of localauthorities to shoulder a new and unknown obligation, before theyhave had sufficient time to digest the heavy burdens thrown oncounties and county boroughs by the Local Government Act, 1929.          These observations are made to show the delicacy anadifficulty of the negotiations necessitated by the scheme, to say nothing of the doubt as to the actual tenas of service whioh it mayin fact be possible to arrange with doctors and midwives.   If,however, a scheme is to be evolved on the lines of the schemespublicly put forward and disoussed, then I am satisfied that thegeneral lines will have to be those set forth in the Appendix tothis memorandum, and if my colleagues are prepared to face thefinancial commitment involved, I should set the necessarynegotiations on foot and endeavour to bring the scheme intooperation as early as may be found practicable.          At the same time, I cannot but appreciate that thefinancial ooamiitment uey be regarded in present conditions as a formidable obstacle to the scheme, and I have given some consideration  to a possible alternative.          The basic principles in such a possible alternative would be:-     (a)  to abandon any definite linking up vf the scheme with national Health Insurance, the insured woman or wife of the insuredman having no differential privileges as compared with any otherpersonj     (b)  to aim at extending the present provision of ante-natalclinics under the maternity and child welfare schemes of looalauthorities so that a sufficient number of these clinics is available in the area of every county and couxity borough to dealwith all women needing assistance in pregnancy and at or after

(o) to expand the maternity work based on those olinics sothat it gradually embodies as many as possible of the variouselements of a comprehensive maternal mortality scheme as laiddown in the Interim Report of the Maternal Lortality Committeeand set out at the beginning of the appendix to this memorandum.          The position under this alternative would be that Ishould begin by a campaign of general public instruction as to theimportance of action to deal with maternal mortality and by urginglocal authorities to develop their system of ante-natal clinicsand organisation to the maximum possible extent.   At the outsetit would be no more than fair to press on them the view that thisis precisely one of the extensions of service in consideration ofwhich a large sum of new Exchequer money was provided under the localGovernment Act, 1929.   Sooner or later as the liabilities developed the question of grant would arise and would then have to be considered on its merits and with reference to such factors as the new assess-ment of the block grant now due in little more than two years.   Theamount could be adjusted to the extent of the new services to beprovided and in this way a cartful check on its growth could bemaintained.          Action on such lineB is, of course, far less speotacularthan would be the major scheme and would be politically lessattractive.   But if my colleagues are seriously impressed by thedifficulties, financial and other incidental to the major scheme,they may think it best that I should develop on the alternative line.I should, in that event consider carefully oaS independentlywhether I oannot get better health value for the National HealthInsuofaMe maternity benefit by e.g. providing, that a fixed proportionof it, say, one half i.s withheld until evidei.ee is given of attendance of a midwife or doctor on confinement.                                          (Initialled) A. G.10th September.Kinistry of Health.
             HEADS OF MATERNITY SCHEME.(a)   The essential sorvifces to be provided under the  scheme  aresummed up as follows in the recently published Interim Report  ofthe Committee on Maternal Mortality and Morbidity:-     (1)  Provision in every case of the services of  a           qualified midwife to aot either as midwife or           maternity nurse;     (2)  provision in every case of a doctor to carry out           ante-natal and post-natal examination and  to           attend during pregnancy, labour and the puerporium,           as may prove neoessary, all oases showing  any           abnormality;     (3)  provision of a  consultant when desired by  the           doctor in attendance during pregnahoy, labour and           the puerpex*itim;     (4)  provision of hospital beds for such cases as need           institutional card;     (5)  provision of certain ancillary services (e.g.           transport, sterilised equipment, laboratory           facilities).(3) (4) and (5) are additional to the services oontomplated inthe scheme which was before the Royal Commission on national health Insurance 11926) and which, as stated in cabinet paper 225(30) formed the subjeot of tho further investigationmade by instruction of my predecessor.(b)  The soheme would bevoperated, as a matter of stautory obligation, by county and county borough councils, subject  to a power to the  county council to delegate all or any part of itjwith prior approval of Minister of Health, to a county districtcouncil/
 council which  is a maternity and child welfare authority.      (c)  The  scheme would cover, as a matter of statutory obligation, all insured women and wives of insured men, and also  would he  available, at the discretion of the local authority, to  any other women, includiiig unmarried mothers, subject to such repayment as can be recovered in suoh oases, also  at the discretion of the local authority,      (d)  The  terms of service of doctors and midwives (and possibly also  consultants) would be negotiated centrally with representative bodies.   Such terms to inolude provision for securing proper service, under appropriate penalty - contract of service thus arranged to be with the local and not the central authority, as in the case of the E.H.I. Medioal 3arvice contract,      (c)  A panel of doctors,  midwivea (and possibly consultants)would be established for each county and county borough area towork  the scheme in that area.    A pregnant woman would have power to select doctor and midwife to attend on her, subject tpacceptance of her by one or both of them.    If a wman, in, a normal pregnancy, desires the  service of the doctor througnpu$pregnancy and at and after puerperium, a supplementary payment would be made by her.      (i)  The total number of  confinements (ir-oluding Still Births)in Great Britain during the last three years has varied from766,000 to 780,000.   Approximately 82$ of this number (or630,000) is covered by the National Health Insurance Act.    Ofthe balance (140,000) it i3 impossible to  say what proportion                                                        will/
will voluntarily avail themselves of the scheme.    Manyuninsured women will continue to look after themselves and indeed some proportion of the insured women and wives qf^aadnsured men may also elect to do so.     For the purposes ofdiscussion, the total number of cases can scarcely be put at less than 680,000 at the start and may, as the schemeestablishes itself, increaso up to &amp;s much as, say, 730,000.INSURANCE CLASS.(g)   The Insurance part of the Scheme would cover all the services(1) to (5) above, except that as regards (4) and (5) no firmguarantee c^uld be given.   So far as institutional treatment weregiven, the money saved on midwives and for doctors fees would go tothe local authority as in paragraph (L) (6) below.        It should be added that insured women are entitled as suchtv? ordinary medical attendance during pregnancy, and similarattendance would ;pe provided under the scheme for the uninsuredwives of insured men.(h)   No supplementary payments would be made by &quot;insurance&quot;patients other than as in (e) above, and no residual liabilitywould fall on the funds of Approved Societies.(i)   To defray the cost of the Insurance part of the Scheme threeCentral National Health Insurance funds (England, Scotland andWales) would be established  y means of     (1)     A transfer from Insurance Funds of the valuo               the actuarial provision for Maternity            Benefit under the National Health Insurance            Act, less  1. Cash Maternity Benefit            to  be left with Approved  Societies in respect                                                   of /
                                                            0 &apos;7 ^            of the uninsured wife of eaoh insured man,  and  2 in            respect of eaoh insured married woman.   (It is            estimated that this transfer would amount            approximately to  1,000,000 per annum) j   and      (2) An annual Exchequer grant equivalent to the            residual cost of Services (1), (2) and (3)  above.            As to the cost of services (4) and (5) see  paragraph            (L) following.U) FINANCE OF IflSPRAWOE PART OF S0HB.&apos;flE*          The Royal Commission on National Health Insurance(1926) estimated the cost for 717^00) confinements at 1,900,000 per annum (the cash benefit Is not inoluded  In this figure) basing their oaloulations or. a fee of 30/- for  themidwife and a total fee of 15/&quot; for -!;he doctor to coverante-natal and post-natal examinations and the risk of  personalattendance in oases presenting some  bnormal feature.   Theydid not, however, Include points (3), (4) and (5) under (a)above in their scheme.          The British Medical Association estimated the cost per 500,000 confinements at  2,100,000 per annum.   This figureincluded  300,000 for services (4) and (5) under (a), nowproposed to be left to the local authorities (see note  (L))*For 717,000 confinements the B.M.A. cost of servioes (1), (2)and (3) would be  2,580,000*   Under the B.M.A. scheme  themidwife&apos;s fee is inoreased from 30/** tc 50-/*- and the total feeof the doctor from 15/*- to 16/6*          Aasuming:-      (1) A transfer from Insurance Funds of nearly  1,000,000           a year   ((1)(1) above);                                                        (8)/
     (2)  A continuance of tho lower birth rate.   (The Royal           Commission estimated for 717,000 insurance oonfine-           ments.   The average number during the past three           years was 630,000) - and     (3)  The actuarial estimates made in 1926 as to the           proportion and age distribution of married men and           women among the insured population continue to hold           good.          The Exchequer liability under (i)(2) above wouldapproximate to  700,000 a year, if a settlement with the doctors and midwives could be effected at the rates specified by theRoyal Commission.          If the midwives fee was fixed at 40/- (being the moanbetween the figure of the Royal commission and that of theB.M.A.) and l6/6d. was given to the doctors, the exchequer grant under (i)(2) would approximate to  1,100,000.NON-INSURANCE CLASS.          Assuming 70,000 confinements, the cost of services(1), (2) and (3) (midwife 40/- and doctor and consultant 20/-)would approximate to  310,000 a year.In this figure the fee of the midstife is taken at 40/- and a slamof 20/- is allowed for the fee of the doctor and of the consultant,the proportion of oases requiring a consultant following theestimate made by the B.M.A.          The non-insurance class would not have the privilege of ordinary government &amp;ical attendance during pregnanoy provided for the insured woman, and the uninsured wife of the insured man.          Th/e Exchequer liability would be the sum stated.                                                  GENERAL/
 GENERAL. (k)   Payments  in  respect of all  services  (1),  (2) and (3) would be made  by the  central authorities  to the local authorities against the number of  oases bandied by the latter, the payments in respect of insuranoe oases out of the appropriate fictional Health Insurance  Pund, and in respect of non-insurance oases out of the appropriate Departmental  Vote. S3R7IQSS  (4) and  (5). (L)   It is considered that expenditure on these ought to be defrayed  from rate funds beoause -      (1)  it is reasonable to ask looal authorities to make a          partnership contribution with the Uxchecpier;      (Z)  looal authorities should have a financial interest          in the scheme;      (3)  local authorities will retain what they recover          from the uninsured who take advantage of the scheme;      (4)  the scheme should enable them to make savings on          their maternity and ohild welfare scheme;      (5)  the Local government Aot, 1929,  provided a large          sum of money fox development of services;  and      (6) money will be available from the insurance scheme          in respect of the institutional treatment of insuranoe          cases, so far as that is given in normal oases,  instead         of the service of doctor and midwife. (m) l&apos;b.3 foregoing fiaurres are given with all reserve,bain;:; subject to the terms sshich can be actually negotiatedfor the servioes to be  rendered by doctors,  midwives andconsultants.                                                          :?he/
     (n)  The E.M.A. estimated in 1929 that not mo^e than halfof 1 par cent, of the total&apos; births in the patients&apos;  own homeswould require the services of an anaesthetist, and not morethan one-third of 1 per cent, the service of a consultant.   Ifthese percentages are lnorea3ad or if (as recant discussions in the B.M.A. would suggest) the consultants are looidng for higher fees than those originally named, an increase in theExchequer liability (not considerable in amount) would be involved.     (o)  It may be added that the Royal Commission estimateincludes a fee of 10/6. for ordinary medical attendance duringpregnancy on tho uninsured woman, wives of insured men (about450,000 in number).   No opinion as to the adequacy or otherwise of this figure has been expressed on behalf of the british medical Association.          On the bast estimate which oan at present beforecasted, it would seem that the o0 3t to the Exchequer mightbe of the range of one to one-and-a-half million a year.
