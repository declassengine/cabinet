COPT NO.  3 6CP.  294 (30).THE CABINET.DISPOSAL  OF  SURPLUS  MUNITIONS   TO  FOREIGN                             COUNTRIES.           (Former Papers CP. 275 (29), 361 (29) and 46 (30).)       MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  WAR.   v.:Z    I attach a Memorandum which has  been prepared in ray Department showing, the    57effect  of  the  Cabinet&apos;s present policy  of prohibiting  the  sale  of Government-owned    8&quot;surplus arms and munitions  to foreign Governments, whether directly or through private   3489contractors.   In the circumstances disclosed in  this Memorandum I consider  that thisembargo should be raised except in cases where it is desirable to maintain it for politicaland military  reasons, of  which  the  Foreign  Office  and the  War Office  would  bethe judges.  THE WAR  OFFICE,                             &apos;       28th August, 1930.    .1. Since the Cabinet decisions of 30th October, 1929 (Cabinet 42 (29), Conclusion 7, -and 43 (29), Conclusion 2), the sales of  surplus warlike stores  by the War  Office have.necessarily been negligible (under  600 in value).  Many enquiries have however beenreceived during this period for arms and ammunition of various categories which, but  forthe embargo on  sales  to foreign Governments, could  have  been supplied from surplusstocks held by the  War Department.  The stocks  of  rifles, small arm ammunition and machine guns alone, which are at  present available  for disposal, have  a probable salevalue of some  2,000,000  given an effective demand.     2. Reference has  already been made in OP. 275 (29) and 361 (29) to enquiries madeon behalf of the Chinese and Latvian Governments.   In  addition, enquiries  for warlike stores have been received from the following countries  :          Country.                             Category of arms, etc.     (a) Portugal     ...     ...  Lewis  machine gun parts, and short Lee Enfield rifles.     (b) Afghanistan  ...     ...  Machine guns.     (c) Oman,  Persian Gulf ...  Rifles and ammunition.     (d) Esthonia     ...     ...  Rifles.     (e) Yugo-Slavia  ...     ...  Anti-aircraft and Hotchkiss machine guns.     (/) Bulgaria     ...     ...  Rifles.     Throughout the  period  (November,  1929 August,  1930) there  have been mostpersistent enquiries for all  kinds of munitions for China.     In addition, there have been a number of applications  for  warlike stores for export to destinations not disclosed.     3. While experience indicates that a large proportion of such enquiries lead  nowhere,the demand for  munitions for China  has been so persistent that there can  be little doubtthat  a considerable quantity of our surplus stocks of rifles and  machine guns could havebeen sold for that destination.   It is very probable, too, that this demand is still unsatisfied     (BS0/17) 60 8/30  W.O.P.  5192
in part at any rate.  There is reason to believe that Europe has been scoured for surplusarms  of  British  Army type, and  as  a result a small number of Lewis machine guns(from Italy) and  rifles (from one of the- Baltic States)  have been  consigned to the far east.   As regards small arm ammunition, it is known that at least 50,000,000 rounds ofBritish  pattern are available for sale in various European countries and tbat one Britishfirm (the Soley Armament Coy., Ltd.) whose application to purchase from the War office was refused, have, secured  considerable  quantities of ammunition  on  the Continent forre-sale in China.  A recent consignment of about 2,000,000 rounds purchased in Italy is an example.  This  firm  has also established  an office in Belgium to deal with business ofthis character on the Continent.    4. The  Soley Armament  Coy.,  Ltd.  have  also  reported  to the War Office thefollowing further illustration of the effect of the present policy.     A foreign State recently wished to purchase a large quantity of British surplus armsand undertook to produce and destroy a corresponding quantity of its old stock under the supervision of British officials.   This request was refused, with the result that an orderto the value of nearly   1,000,000 for  rifles of Mauser pattern was placed with a Germanfirm  operating outside Germany,  mind these new rifles became  additional to the stocksalready held by this State.     5. The case  of countries which do not themselves manufacture arms and ammunition and which  in  the past have  obtained most of their requirements from this country, isconsidered worthy of special consideration.   Shortly before the Cabinet  arrived at their decisions of 30th  Oetober last, it had  been arranged, with  some difficulty,  that twocountries, in. this  position, Latvia  and Portugal, would in future present  their requirementsdirectly  to the War Office, and there is no doubt that both these countries would be glad to satisfy their needs of spare parts and replacements from British surplus stocks.  Underthe present policy, these demands must necessarily be diverted, elsewhere,, and our refusal to. meet them is hkely to  appear most  unreasonable to the countries concerned.   Moreover,the (Opportunities for exercising, in the interests of peace, a. controlling influence  on  thedespatch of munitions to  these countries, will be lost or diminished.     6.  There is therefore  evidence  to  show that  since the Cabinet decisions of 30thOetober, 1929, the demand for surplus arms and ammunition by certain foreign countries has been maintained and  is  likely to continue, and that these demands, instead of beingmet from this country, have been met abroad.  In  short, the effect of the embargo  hasbeen, not to reduce the traffic in  arms, but simply to divert it into other channels, to themanifest disadvantage of  this country.     7.  In view of this fact and  of the important financial and other  advantages arisingfromj (the;sale of surplus-.British munitions,, which hawe been: dealt with fully in CP. 275 (JJS-), and in view also/of the-special considenations aoldkieed in. paragraph 5, it is: submitted that the: pnesent policy ehxamkl he: reviewed.
