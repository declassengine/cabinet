CONOID,_____                      CAB I IT E Tj            THE MODEL TREATY TO STRENGTHEN THE MEANSOF PREVENT I NO WJP.1.      I am directed by the Prime Minister to inform the Cabinetth.at, at the la at Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence,the Admiralty expressed certain apprehensions in regard to article 3,  Proposal 3, of the draft of the Model Treaty asit emerged from the last Session at Geneva.    As a decision at the C-.1.D. Meeting was not possible, the Prime minister agreed that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should arrange for a conference between the three Service Ministers,their Chiefs of Staff and Lord Cecil, with a view to framingdefinite Recommendations:  this meeting was held on July 24th,and the conclusions are attached to this note.2.      The instructions to the United Kingdom Delegation atGeneva regarding their attitude to the Model Treaty form thesubject of a Cabinet Conclusion in May (Cabinet 29 (30)  Conclusion 2)and, as the Recommendations suggested by Mr.  Henderson&apos;sCommittee involve amendments to this Conclusion and necessitateofficial instructions to the United Kingdom Delegation at theforthcoming Geneva Session, the Prime Minister desires the matter to be brought before the Cabinet again for final approval.3 v-      The attached paper shows exactly what the Recommendationsinvolve and the reasons for these Recommendations, put brieflyare as follows:-     (a)     The Air Force desired to substitute the word        &quot;invaded&quot; for the word &quot;penetrated&quot; to avoid any      ...
                                                       2 J 0        possibility  of  questions being raised should we        require  to despatch air reinforcements to or        through  Iraq or some  other  country with, which        we had an alliance.   The \ise of the word        &quot;invaded&quot; precludes any such possibility.   (b)        The insertion of the word &quot;land&quot; before &quot;forces&quot;        has been suggested at the instigation of the        Admiralty, who  were apprehensive that,  under this        Article,  it  would be  open to tho League to issue        orders regarding the  movements and dispositions of        our Fleet.    The insertion of the word &quot;land&quot;        expressly excludes naval forces from the provisions        cf this  Article.   If  this amendment is  agreed to at        Geneva by other countries;  it will be necessary to        indicate in  some manner, which can, I think, be        left to  our  Delegation, that the expression &quot;land        forces&quot;  includes air  forces co-operating with then.   (c)        The third  Recommendation was put forward &quot;by        Lord Cecil,  and is merely to the effect that the        League,  in ordering forces  which have invaded another        State to be  withdrawn, shall at the sane time indicate        a line behind which the forces should be withdrawn.        This proposal was accepted  by the War Office, subject        to a safeguard  that we should not be askod to        withdraw behind the exterior limits of  any defence        organisations of such a kind as exist on the North-        West Frontier of India.   Lord Cecil has undertaken        to submit a  redraft of the  Clause in question.        This proposal therefore,  can only be approved in        principle, since the  new Article is not y-t ready.                     (Signed) M.P.A.HAHKEY.                        Secretary to the Cabinet.hitehall Gardens, S.V7.1. 29th July, 1930.
y. If the Article is accepted at Geneva in this  form,  it  will &quot;be necessary to make it clear that the expression  &quot;land forces&quot; includes &quot;air forces&quot;.   If,  however, the  word &quot;invaded&quot; is not accepted,  then any specific  mention  of air forces should be omitted if possible.            Clause 1, Proposal B, Article 2.        This Clause reads as follows in tho present draft: -            &quot;If, in the event of a threat of war,   he Council,        acting in virtue of the provisions of Article 11  of        the Covenant of the League of Nations, recommends        the withdrawal of the forces of one of the High        Contracting Parties having penetrated into the        territory of another Otate or into a zone  demilitarised,        in virtue of international treaties,  the High        Contracting Parties undertake to comply therewith        without delay&quot;4First amendment proposed.        To substitute the word &quot;invaded&quot; for the word&quot;penetrated&quot; subject to the Foreign Office Legal Adviserbeing satisfied that the situations covered by the word&quot;penetrated&quot; are also covered by the word &quot;invaded&quot;.(it is understood that the Foreign Office Legal Adviserwill accept this substitution).Second amendment proposed.        To insert the word &quot;land&quot; before the word&quot;forces&quot;.        Clause I, Proposal B, Article 2, ao amended in accordance with the above suggestions will read asfollows:-            &quot;If, in the event of a threat of war,  the Council        acting in virtue of the provisions of Article 11  of        the Covenant of tho League of Nations, recommend^                                        s        the withdrawal of the land forces of one of  the High
        Contracting Parties having invaded the territory of        another State or a zone demilitarised, in virtue of        international treaties, the High Contracting Parties        undertake to comply therewith without delay5&apos;.Third Recom-iendation.        That an additional provision he added to article , Proposal B, to the effect that forces which had invadedor threatened to invade foreign territory,  etc.  might hedirected to withdraw he hind a line to he fixed &quot;by theCouncil.    Acceptance of this provision,  however,  beingmade subject to a safeguard being inserted to the effectthat no Power would be expected to withdraw behind theoxterior limits of any defence organisations of such a kind as exist on the North-Vest Frontier of India,  andthat Lord Cecil be asked to prepare a redraft of thisArticle in the above sense,, which should be circulatedto the Service Departments when completed.
