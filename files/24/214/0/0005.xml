THE FCROLS.Note by the Secretary.        I am instructed by the Prime Minister to circulate an extract from the Minutes of the 849thMeeting of the Committee    Imperial Defence on thesubject of the Palestine Garrison, together with theReport o^ -a  Sub-Committee on that subject.  ThePrime Minister asks the Cabinet to approve the following conclusions  in regard to the strength, transport and accommodation of the garrison:-    &quot;(a) That the garrison should continue to         include, for the present, an infantry         force equivalent to two battalions, and         that the present strength of aircraft         and arc-.endeavoured cars in Palestine and Trans-         Jordan should be maintained.     (b) That the strength o^ the garrison should         be reviewed annually by the Committee of         Imperial Defence, and th.?.t,  in this con-         nection, the possibility of substituting         a &quot;porce of British gendarmerie for the         infantry battalions might be further         considered *     (c) That the Departments concerned should         consider the recommendation for station-         ing an R^AoS^C. unit, with suitable         transport, in Palestine to avoid the         present expensive system o-rr hiring,         and should report to the Cabinet whether,
         on financial grounds, the suggestion         is desirable.     (d) That if the recommendation in (a)         above is approved by the Cabinet,  the         question of providing suitable, aceom-         mod-tion for the garrison should be         taken up by the Departments concerned0&quot;        In regard to the question of the  Command,the recommendation of the Committee uf ImperialDefence was as follows:-    &quot;(e) That the Prime Minister, together with         the Secretaries of State for the         Colonies, War and Air, should consider         further the question of the Command in         Palestine and report the result  of their         discussion to the Cabinet&quot;.        The Prime Finister has since been in communi-cation on the subject with the Secretaries  of state concerned,  and as a result invites the Cabinet to approve the resolutions given below.  He  instructsme to state, however, that the Secretary  of Statefor War has not altered his view that the responsi-bility for the Command in Palestine should be vested in the (Var Office, and reserves the right- to raise-ohe question again when the occasion is more propiti-ous than it is at present for introducing, a changeof this nature.        Subject to the above, the Prime Minister&apos;recommendation to the Cabinet is as follows:-            The High Commissioner, whq is also         Commander-inmChief, is rssponsible both         for defence against external attack and         for the maintenance of law and order.            For defenee against external  attack         his pi-incipnl adviser is the Air Officer         Commanding, who ha.s at his disposal all         the armed forces of the Crown in Palestine.            For the maintenance of law and order         he is dependent for advice on the civil         authorities, whose principal  force is         the police.  If the police forces prove         inadequate they can be rein^o-oed by         the armed forces of the Crown.
   While the Air Officer Consnandingremains responsible for the employmentof the forces under his Command,whether for external defence or for support to the civil power in themaintenance of law and order, it isdesirable that the Senior military officer should be given formally theright 0&apos;-0 direct access to the HighCommissioner on questions of internal security, on the understanding thatall arrangements made as the resultof such access should be subject tothe concurrence of the Air OfficerCommanding,   For inspection a nd. a dm inistrativepurposes, the military units will be under the orders of tire General OfficerCommanding British Troops in Egypt, asis the case with the British battalions in the Sudan,               (Signed) M.P.A.KANKEY.Whitehall Gardens; S,:&apos;&apos;V1,   July 29, 19 30.

PALESTINE GARRISON.                    (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 348-C and 350-C.)*      (Previous reference :  C.I.D. Minutes of the 248th Meeting, Minute 8.)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the Report of a Sub-Committee(C.I.D. Paper No. 348-C),  containing recommendations as to the strength, corn-position, &amp;c, of the future garrison in Palestine and the control of the Defence Forcein that  country; and a letter from the Colonial  Office (C.I.D. Paper No. 350-C),*covering an extract from a report on the Palestine Police Force.    THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the fact that the Report  (C.I.D.Paper No. 348-C) was divided into two distinct parts.  Paragraphs 1 to 13 dealtwith  the  strength of  the  garrison,  and paragraphs  14  to the  end  with  theresponsibility for control.  He suggested that the Committee  should start by dealingwith the recommendations in paragraph 13 (a), (b), (c) and  (d), and that Sir JohnChancellor, the High Commissioner, should first give nis views.    SIR JOHN CHANCELLOR said he saw no reason to change the view expressedin his despatch of last January, that it was not possible to have less than two infantry battalions in Palestine.  The position as between the Jews and Arabs had not sinceimproved.  In  fact,  it was  rather worse,  as the  &quot; fellahin &quot;  were  now  convincedthat they had lost land and  employment owing to the  activities of the Jews.  Thisview was confirmed by Sir John Hope-Simpson.    About two months before leaving Palestine he had arranged for the preparationof a new Local Defence scheme.  This was based on the presence in Palestine of two battalions, in addition to the aircraft, armoured cars, and units of the Trans-JordanFrontier Force. The Local Defence  Committee in  Palestine  were convinced that itwould be  unsafe to reduce the British troops by one man.  They had considered areduction of the  garrison, which would leave Jaffa without  any troops, but  had unanimously come to the conclusion that it would be unsafe, in view of the constantpossibility of trouble between the Jews and Arabs of Tel-Avir and Jaffa, to keep thetroops even half-an-hour distant from those towns.    There was another consideration to be taken into account, namely, the anxietyof the French in Syria.  Although the attitude of the French High Commissionerhad been very helpful during the disturbances last year, he  was-informed that theFrench  Government would protest if the present garrison were reduced.  They hadalready expressed concern when the reduction from  three to two battalions took placelast October, but he had reassured them by telling them that he had an immediate callon two  further battalions from Egypt or Malta.    LORD PASSFIELD observed that the Committee should not assume that therewould be  always  two full Infantry Battalions in Palestine.    The  two units about to be sent there were between 300 and 400 under strength, and he understood  thatthe War Office would not be able to bring them up  to fuil strength for some months.                             * Not circulated to Cabinet.[21389-3]B
     SIE GEORGE MILNE said that this was one of those difficult administrative questions which are liable to crop up in the Army, but he (hoped to be able to make arrangements ensuring that the two battalions would remain under strength for the shortest possible time.     LORD PASSFIELD drew attention to the recommendation in paragraph 13 (6) of the Report that the possibility of substituting a force of British gendarmerie for the  infantry battalions might be further considered.  The Colonial Office  would naturally agree to the consideration of this suggestion  in due course, but he warned the  Committee that there could be  no possibility of any gendarmerie replacing the infantry battalions for some years.  -     SIR  JOHN CHANCELLOR remarked that the functions  of troops  were entirely different  from those of police.  The role of the latter was to prevent disturbances  so far  as they  could,  while the  troops were required to suppress disturbances after they had arisen.     THE  PRIME MINISTER  asked  if the War Office  representatives had any remarks on the suggestion in paragraph 13 (c) of the Report that  an R.A.S.C. unit should be provided.     SIR GEORGE MILNE said that the only difficulty was, the financial one, as the transport would cost money.     SIR JOHN CHANCELLOR pointed out that at present lorries had to be  hirea by the military at considerable expense.     SIR GEORGE MILNE agreed  that it would probably be cheaper  to provide military transport than to continue hiring, but he would have to go into the question of what transport vehicles would actually be required, and as to what Department was to bear the cost.     MR. SHAW emphasised that the War Office wished  to avoid an extra charge being made on the Army estimates for this transport, and he understood that the Colonial Office were examining the question of Palestine bearing the extra expense incurred through military units being located in Palestine instead of at their normal station.     LORD PASSFIELD said that the question had not yet been settled, but it was generally accepted that so long as Palestine was in a position to do so, it should pay the extra cost.  He understood that at the present time the cost of hired transport was being  incurred by the military, and the  suggestion was that an R.A.S.C.  unit would be less expensive.     THE  PRIME  MINISTER  suggested  that  the Committee  should accept recommendation 13 (c) on the understanding  that it would involve no extra cost to the Exchequer, and that the Departments concerned should go into the question, and report to the  Cabinet  if their investigations showed this was necessary.     He then  turned to the second part  of the Report dealing with the question of control, pointing out that the respective views of the  War Office and Air Ministry were given in  paragraphs 16 and 17,  and that the arguments appeared to be on thewhole fairly evenly balanced.     LORD THOMSON  said  that  his view was that  in Palestine there were two distinct functions to be considered.  One was  the responsibility for internal security in Palestine, and the other was the question of the external defence of both Trans-Jordan and Palestine.  It was admitted that at the present time two battalions were required in Palestine for internal security  in  order  to reinforce the inadequate police.  It was, however, difficult to describe the functions of these battalions as military, and he noticed in the Defence Scheme that, according to the distribution ofthe infantry during the precautionary stage, there would never be more than two companies  in one place.  The only real military danger to Palestine lay in possible incursions by Arabs from without, and infiltration across the Trans-Jordan Frontier into Palestine.  In his opinion the most  effective method of dealing with this danger was the present one, namely, by means of aircraft, supported by armoured cars and local levies under the Air Officer Commanding.     MR. SHAW said that while  he did not feel qualified  to deal with purelytechnical considerations, as a layman, he could not appreciate the  rigid distinction
between the duties of the Royal Air Force and the Army laid down by the Secretaryof State for Air. He could not see that it was more a military function to keep outraiders who might  upset  the whole system of  law and  orcler than to suppressdisturbances aimed at the same purpose but initiated from within. The fact was thatin Palestine trouble had in the past developed, as might well happen in the future, insuch  a  way as to make it essential  to have  armed military forces in the country,because it was outside the competence of the Royal Air Force to keep order with theirown means. This was proved last year and, as a result, there was now in Palestine amilitary force far superior in numbers to the units of the Royal Air Force and withfar greater responsibility  as regards law and order.   It  seemed to him that thesuggestion of the High Commissioner that the security of Palestine must  rest on themilitary arm was thoroughly sound.    THE PRIME MINISTER said that he gathered from Sir John Chancellorsreports that the command  in Palestine should be vested in a military officer.    SIR JOHN CHANCELLOR replied in the affirmative, adding that,  personally,he would describe the situation as regards internal disorder in rather  different words from  those used by the  Secretary  of State for Air.  There were  two  distinctdefence problems to be considered that of Palestine and that of Trans-Jordan. Thelatter was an open desert country where the Royal Air Force had done extraordinarilygood  work in dealing with raiders.   Owing to the nature of the country, it waspossible for the aircraft to detect raiders, and by means of  wireless to get armoured cars on their tracks and control their movements.  Finally,  in order to round up theraiders and sort out the looted  camels, &amp;o,  from others  and  regain possession ofthem, the  Trans-Jordan Frontier Force was employed.    In Palestine, on the  other hand,  the  situation was  entirely different.  Thecountry was enclosed, with a good deal of bush, in the Jordan Valley and rugged hillcountry, and the Arabs were clever  in concealing themselves from air observation.Air reconnaissance was by no means adequate by itself  in a country  of this nature,and it was essential to have military troops on the  ground to round  up marauders,to protect isolated Jewish  colonies, to keep order in the large towns, and generally to clear up the country.  The Air Force could not do any of these things, and he couldonly recall one instance during the disturbances last year in which aircraft, unaided,turned back an Arab advance on Haifa from the open country to the north.  It wasimpossible to rely on aircraft being in the right place at the right time for suchfleeting actions.    LORD PASSFIELD pointed out that this latter  difficulty applied  also in thecase  of the military forces.  He did not wish  to intervene in the dispute betweenthe Army  and the Royal Air Force, but he was concerned in regard to the suggestionthat there might be one command in Palestine and another  in Trans-Jordan, as this might produce complications, owing to the  fact that  the Trans-Jordan frontier force was partly paid for by  Trans-Jordan  and partly  by Palestine, and was intended to be available for both countries.  It appeared preferable for one military officer either to take command of the forces in both countries or not to assume the command  at all.    SIR RICHARD HOPKINS, in reply to the Prime Minister, said  he  did notthink the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been able to study this question.    THE PRIME MINISTER  remarked that the point before the Committee wasa difficult  one, and he was  sorry  that the Sub-Committee had not been able to make an agreed  recommendation, though he appreciated the hesitancy of the Chairmanto exercise a casting vote.   In view of the discussion which had now taken place, he felt that there was no alternative to reserving -the matter for decision by the Cabinet.He referred to a passage in the Report of the Indian Statutory Commission  (Vol. I)in regard  to the role of the British Army  in  India, which had some  bearing on theuse of the army in support of the civil power, and might be read in connection withthe use of military  forces in Palestine.   There  was one  suggestion  which theCommittee might like to consider, namely, that  the Officer commanding the military force  while remaining under the orders of the Air Officer commanding  should begiven the  right of direct  access,  on purely military  matters,  to the High Com-missioner, who is also ex officio  Commander-in-Chief.    This would apply, in an inverse form, the system  now in operation in India,which, he  was informed, worked satisfactorily.   Under  this system, the Air Officercommanding, although under the  orders of the military Commander-in-Chief,  has theright  of direct access to the Viceroy.       [21389^3]                                                    B 2
    SIR JOHN CHANCELLOR observed that at the present  time he  frequentlysaw and consulted the officer commanding the troops, with the knowledge and consentof the Air Officer commanding.    MR. SHAW said he hoped that the Secretary of State for Air would withdraw from his present position.   He asked if anyone could possibly doubt that, in theevent of the situation in Palestine taking an  unfavourable  turn, reinforcementsAvould have to be military, just as they were last August.  He  could not understand why it  should be  maintained that it was less of  a military function  to stopindividuals  smashing the entity of the State from  inside than  to prevent  themdoing so if they came from outside.  Surely it was  advisable for the commander tobe a military  officer, so that  he could  deal systematically with the preponderatingmilitary troops in  the  country and  with  the question of additional  military reinforcements in the event of an emergency.   while greatly regretting that thiscontroversy had arisen, he felt that the Secretary  of State for Air should realise the actual  facts of  the  situation  and agree  that  they warranted command  by amilitary officer.    LORD THOMSON said  he wished he was in a  position to accede to the requestof the Secretary of State for War, but he felt he should  point out that  it was thelatter who was trying to alter a state of affairs  agreed to in 1922 under which theColonial Office were responsible for Palestine  and  Trans-Jordan, with  the AirMinistry as their military  agent.  He submitted that if  the real military problem and the problem of  greatest  danger to Palestine had to be dealt with, this wouldhave to be done by  air forces.   The situation&apos; inside Palestine did not affect thequestion of command, which would not have now arisen if there had been an adequatePolice Force.  The  two battalions were distributed exactly as if they were police.The real danger lay in the possibility of invasion by the Arabs, and the danger spotwould be the Jordan Valley, where there were no military forces and where Britishtroops could not be stationed.    SIR JOHN CHANCELLOR  remarked that there were two Companies of the trans-Jordan  Frontier Force in the Jordan  Valley  and that they were  militarytroops, in spite of the fact that they were under  the Air Officer commanding.    LORD  THOMSON, continuing,  pointed out  that  the Air  Ministry had adefinite  Air Scheme drawn up  for the  whole of the Middle East.  If some of their forces were now to be taken away and locked up  under military command for policework, the Air  Ministry would have to reconsider the whole question of  the distribu-tion of Air Forces in the Middle East.  What was really required to meet the presentsituation in Palestine was an adequate force of gendarmerie.    SIR JOHN CHANCELLOR  observed that  the functions of police and troops were entirely different and that the gendarmerie would have to be trained as militarytroops, and not as police, to undertake the functions required of them in the event ofan outbreak.    LORD THOMSON  drew attention to the fact  that the two  infantry battalionswere scattered, according to Mr. Dowbiggin&apos;s  Report, over a very large area in thesame way as police forces, and that if they were intended for employment as militarytroops this would not be the case.    SIR JOHN CHANCELLOR agreed  that  that distribution was shown in mr. Dowbiggin&apos;s report, but  said that the dispersion was temporary and was onlynecessary until the British part of the Palestine Police Force had been brought  up tothe  proper  establishment.   When  that  had  been  done,  the  troops  would be concentrated.                                 CONCLUSIONS.    After some further discussion the COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed torecommend :     (a) That the garrison should continue to include,  for the present, an infantry           force equivalent to two  battalions,  and that the present strength of           aircraft and armoured cars in Palestine and Trans-Jordan should be           maintained.
******2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,      July 14, 1930.o(b)  That the  strength of  the garrison should be reviewed  annually by the      Committee  of Imperial  Defence, and that,  in  this  connection, the      possibility of substituting a force of British gendarmerie for the infantry      battalions might be further considered.(c) That the Departments concerned should consider the recommendation for      stationing an R.A.S.C. unit,  with  suitable transport,  in  Palestine  to      avoid the present  expensive system of hiring,  and should report to the      Cabinet whether, on financial  grounds, the suggestion is desirable.(d) That if the recommendation in  \a) above is approved by the  Cabinet, the.      question of providing suitable accommodation for the garrison should  be      taken up by the Departments  concerned.(e) That the Prime  Minister, together with the Secretaries of State for the      Colonies,  War and Air, should consider further the  question of. the      Command in Palestine and report the result of their discussion to the      Cabinet.

PALESTINE  GARRISON.(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 345-C.)                         Report of a Sub-Committee.Composition and Terms of Reference.    1.  BY direction of the Prime Minister the Sub-Committee, consisting of         The Secretary of State for  the Colonies (in the Chair),        The Secretary of State for War,        The Secretary of State for Air,        The Secretary to the Treasury,        The Chief of the Imperial General Staff,        The Chief of the Air Staff,was set up to consider and report  to the Committee of  Imperial Defence on thefollowing  questions raised by the Secretary of  State for the Colonies in a letter,dated the  12th May, 1930  (Appendix),  to the  Secretary, Committee  of  ImperialDefence :     (1)  The strength, composition,  &amp;c, of the  future garrison in Palestine;    (2)  The suggested transfer of control from the Air Ministry to the War Office;          and    (3)  The control of  operations  in the event of  reinforcements  being sent to          Palestine.The Strength, Composition, &amp;c, of the future Garrison in Palestine    2.  In 1926 the last remaining regular army unit,  a regiment of cavalry, was withdrawn from Palestine, and thereafter the forces available for the maintenanceof internal order and for  external defence consisted solely of the Palestine Police(including a small proportion of British personnel), the Trans-Jordan Frontier Forceand Air and Armoured Car Units of the Royal Air Force.      f2127/]  [21404]                   .&quot;                            b
    3.  On the  outbreak of disturbances in  August  1929  naval  and  military reinforcements were rushed to Palestine from Malta and Egypt to restore order, andat the present time there remain in Palestine, in addition to one B.A.F. squadron and two Armoured Car Sections  (from Trans-Jordan),  two Battalions of regularBritish Infantry.    4.  The question of the permanent garrison was  referred  to  by the recentCommission on the Palestine disturbances in the following words :-          &quot;The events of August last clearly established that  for  the duties  of    checking the widespread disturbances and restoring order in Palestine infantry    are more  effective than are  either aeroplanes or armoured cars.  On the wider    question whether aeroplanes and  armoured cars are  the most suitable form  of    garrison for Palestine there  was direct  conflict between the evidence  of the    experts who appeared before us,  and we  can only  suggest that this question    should be  considered by the proper advisers of His Majesty&apos;s Government, whose    attention  should,  we consider,  be drawn to the views  expressed to us  by    Vice-Marshal Dowding and Brigadier Dobbie.        We recommend that until the question of the form  of the future garrison    has been  decided  and thereafter  until racial  feeling in Palestine has shown    more marked improvement, no reduction should be made in the present garrison    of two Battalions of Infantry.&quot;    5.  In a  despatch dated the 17th January, 1930, the High Commissioner forPalestine also  expressed the view &quot; that the permanent garrison in Palestine should include two Battalions of British Infantry with the necessary ancillary services.&quot;    6.  The strength of the military forces required in Palestine must necessarily depend to a large extent on the efficiency of the local police forces, and Mr. Dow-biggin, Inspector-General of Police, Ceylon, who is at present in Palestine for thepurpose of advising on the organisation of the Palestine Police, has not yet submittedhis final report.  A preliminary statement of his recommendations with regard  todistribution of the British police and the protection of Jewish Colonies has, however,been received, and these recommendations, which have been approved by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, are based  on the  following  assumptions  made by Mr.Dowbiggin      (i) that military forces and British police will be required in Palestine for  at           least twenty years;    (ii) that the garrison will include two infantry battalions and two companies  of           the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force,  as well as  the Royal Air Force and           armoured cars.    7.  Mr. Dowbiggin has expressed the opinion that it will take at  least twenty years  under the  most favourable conditions to attain a reasonable  state of efficiencyamong the Palestinian police, and although he is in full agreement  with the wellrecognised principle that it is primarily the function of the police and not of themilitary to prevent and to deal with disturbances, he is convinced that military forces should be  available to assist the  civil power should the necessity arise.    8.  The Sub-Committee  have  been unable  to  appreciate  the  &quot;conflict  ofevidence&quot; as to  the most suitable form of garrison to which the  Shaw Commissionreferred on page 145  of their Report.  Both Air Vice-Marshal  Dowding andBrigadier Dobbie  appear to consider  that  an infantry  force  of two battalions  isnecessary  for the present, though the former thinks that  this force could be reducedto one battalion when the reorganisation of the Police  Force has been completed.While agreeing that a force equivalent to two battalions of Infantry will be necessaryfor some time  to come, the Sub-Committee would hesitate to endorse the  opinion thatit would be required &quot;for at least twenty years.&quot;    9.  The Air Ministry are, however,  in some doubt as to whether,  on grounds  of expediency&apos; and economy,  this  force  should  take the  form  of  British infantry battalions.  They point out that it has for many years been the  policy of HisMajesty&apos;s  Government to discourage the provision of  Imperial Forces for main-taining the authority of Local  Governments.  The reasons underlying this policy
have been frequently enunciated by the Oversea Defence Committee when making-recommendations regarding the local forces in the Colonies in the following words :&quot; The  maintenance  of  Imperial regular garrisons,  except  at strategical points,in time of peace in the British Colonies and Protectorates would be a costly system,would  result in highly trained  troops being used for purposes for which a great part of their military instruction is not suited, and would have many obvious dis-advantages as regards the organisation, training, expenditure and mobilisation ofthe Army as a whole.&quot;    They  further  point  out  that  the infantry  force   allotted   to  Palestinewill be tied down to the internal  security of  that country, and  not  available for reinforcing other localities, and they consider that-this factor should be borne inmind in arriving at a decision  as to how this additional commitment is to be providedfor.    10.  For these reasons the Air Ministry suggest  that (as soon as  may be prac-ticable) consideration should be given to the possibility of raising an irregular forceof British  Gendarmerie, the  organisation Of which could be designed specially toenable  it to carry out its functions in the most economical manner.  This force, thoughadministered by the  Palestine Government similarly  to the Trans-Jordan frontier force,  would be a definitely military one and would  be placed under  the orders ofthe officer commanding the garrison, to whatever service he may belong.    While raising no objection to the suggested discussion of this question at some future date, the Colonial Office ask that they should be given an opportunity to putforward their views  before any  decision to replace the British Infantry is made.    11.  The present infantry  force  (or the  gendarmerie,  if  formed)  requiresmechanical transport.  The Sub-Committee  consider that,  so long as the regularinfantry battalions are retained, this transport should be provided by an R.A.S.C.unit with motor lorries, which would undertake both the maintenance and movementof the troops, thus  dispensing with the expensive system of  hirings  which existsat present.    12.  The question of providing suitable accommodation for the garrison shouldalso, in the opinion  of the  Committee, receive immediate attention.  The battalionsare at  present living partXv in billets and partly in hutments, and, if their retentionin Palestine for an indefinite  period is decided upon, it is considered  essential thathutted camps with  a proportion of married Quarters, recreational facilities, &amp;e,should be provided for the wnoie garrison.    13.  To  sum up, the Sub-Committee recommend     (a) That  the garrison should continue to  include for the present an infantry           forqe equivalent to  two battalions, and  that the  present strength  tof           aircraft  and armoured  cars  in Palestine and  Trans-Jordan  should be           maintained.    (6) That  the strength of the  garrison should  be  reviewed annually by the           Committee of  Imperial  Defence,  and  that in  this connection  the           possibility  of substituting  a  force  of British  Gendarmerie  for  the           infantry  battalions might be further considered.    (c) That  the  force be provided with  mechanical transport, and  that, so long-           as  the  infantry battalions  are  retained, this transport should take the           form of a R.A.S.C. unit.    (d) That  the  question of accommodation should be taken up by the  Depart-           ments concerned as soon as a decision has  been reached as  to the nature           of  the garrison.The Suggested Transfer of Control from the Air Ministry to the War Office.    14.  In considering this  question,  the Sub-Committee are  faced with  a directconflict of  opinion between the War Office and the  Air Ministry, and  they  havereluctantly come to the conclusion that they  can do no more than place before theCommittee of Imperial Defence  the views of the three parties concerned,  namely,the High Commissioner, the War Office and the Air Ministry, and leave it to higher authority to come to  a decision.
    15.  The High Commissioner, who  is primarily responsible to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment for public security in Palestine, has advocated the transfer of commandfrom the Air Ministry to the War Office in the following words:         &quot; During the recent disturbances, by far the greater part of the  work of    restoring order fell upon the Military Forces, and it is logical that the  ultimate    responsibility for the defence of the country should rest with  the Department    mainly concerned.        If responsibility for the defence  of Palestine is transferred to the War    Office, I recommend that, for defence purposes, Palestine should be made part    of the Egyptian Military Command.        That arrangement would be not only economical and  administratively    convenient,  but it would also be strategically advantageous,  for  it  would    greatly facilitate the reinforcement of the troops in Palestine in time of need &quot;    (Enclosure No. 4 to Appendix, paragraph 100).The views of the War Office are as follows:     16. (i) Under existing conditions the military Command of all regular forcesin Palestine and Trans-Jordan is vested in an officer of the Royal Air Force.  Thiswas the system of command in operation  before August, 1929, when  the only land forces  available for backing the  police amounted to 12 armoured cars and about700 men of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force.  The despatch of army reinforcements,amounting to some 2,000 infantry and 12 armoured cars in August last year to dealwith the communal situation which arose  resulted in the temporary transference ofthe executive command to a military officer who was senior in rank to  the Local AirForce Commander.   The operations were definitely military  as opposed to air andin accordance with the agreement come to by the Chiefs of Staff at their 26th Meetingon the  11th December, 1925, the command of the operation, being essentially militaryin character should in accordance with that agreement, have been transferred to amilitary officer  under  the  War  Office.   In order,  however, to  regain  executivecommand in Palestine, an officer of the Royal Air Force, an Air Vice-Marshal, wasappointed by the Air Ministry to supersede the Brigadier who had so successfullyconducted the operations which culminated in the restoration of law and order.   Anofficer of the Royal Air Force still remains in command although the military forcesin the  country are numerically far superior to the air units even though levies and armoured car units (both of which, the War Office point out, are &apos;&apos; military &apos;&apos; ratherthan &quot; air &quot; in character) are included in the term &quot; air units.&quot;   The contention ofthe Air Ministry that the defence of Palestine is an &quot; air &quot; rather than a &quot;military&quot;problem  is hardly reconcilable with the fact that a  garrison has been agreed upon as being necessary which includes  local military forces and  armoured cars  and inwhich  regular infantry preponderates.     (ii)  The view  of the Air Ministry  that  defence  of the land  frontier takesprecedence  over  other problems  in considering the security  of Palestine  is  notconcurred in.  Admittedly,  periodical raids  by Arabs across  the   frontier willcontinue and these can best be dealt with by highly mobile forces co-operating with air units.   But invasion on a large scale is unlikely to occur unless it  coincides with grave disturbances in the country itself, when the command must be unified.     (iii)  While aeroplanes and  armoured cars can deal effectively  with  raids byBedouins in the open and sparsely-populated regions of Eastern Trans-Jordan, theycannot adequately provide  for  the defence  of Palestine.   They are unable toundertake many of the military operations necessary for  the defence and maintenanceof order in a  country which contains large towns and populous districts, oftenenclosed and wooded, and of which a large area consists of  mountains and  brokencountry.     They are  unable to break up  riotous assemblies  in towns with narrow  andtortuous streets inhabited by a mixed population, or to  protect agricultural coloniesfrom attack by day and night.  They are unable to surround and search villages orto round up roving bands of marauders.  To carry out all these operations effectivelythere is no  substitute  for infantry, preferably made mobile by being  provided with adequate motor transport.
     (iv) The War Office agree with  the  principle that the defence of Palestineagainst external aggression is interlocked with the internal security of the  country,and it would obviously be of assistance to the High Commissioner if he had  only onemilitary adviser to turn to for both questions. That does not, however, seem to themto be an argument against concentrating the command of  all the forces in Trans-Jordan and  Palestine under an army commander.  The view of the Air Ministryseems  to be  that,  while  an officer  of  the RAP.  is capable of exercising  military command over combined air and land forces, the exercise of command by  an armyofficer over similar combined forces could only be to court confusion, or even  disaster.No arguments are advanced to support this contention, and in this connection,  itshould be noted that no military force would be expected to take the field in a modernwar without including air units under the military commander; all senior officers ofthe army are accordingly trained in the handling of Air Forces in conjunction with military Forces.     (v) It appears to be admitted that in the event of further  military reinforce-ments being despatched to Palestine, operations would be vested in a Military officer,as was done last August in the initial and more critical stages of the disturbances.It is, however, unsound and illogical to rely on one system  in peace or when thingsgo  well, and to revert to another  in  war, or when troubles break out.  Whateverexternal dangers may threaten Palestine or Trans-Jordan, there could be little doubtthat the recurrence of communal  trouble in the  future, which is  regarded as apossibility by the  High Commissioner, will be a matter which, if it gets beyond thecontrol of the police, will call definitely for intervention by Army and not by Airunits.   The only sound course would, therefore, be to allow command  to be exercised in peace by a Military officer, who would be responsible for the preparation  of thedefence scheme which will be put into operation if and when internal troubles breakout  again.   The  propinquity  of  Egypt and its military garrison points to thesupreme command of Palestine being placed  under the General Officer CommandingBritish troops in Egypt.  Although heretofore, Palestine has not been his responsi-bility, yet  the call  for  reinforcements which arose  last year  necessitated theimmediate despatch of the nearest troops, namely, those from Egypt, and any furthercall for immediate reinforcements  may have to  be met from the same quarter.  Atthe  present  moment,  the  existing responsibilities  of the  G.O.C., Egypt, do not extend beyond the borders of that country, and  a  call from Palestine for reinforce-ments may quite conceivably coincide with a demand for dealing with a situationwithin Egypt, which has  arisen from the very same causes which  have produceddisorder in Palestine.  He may, therefore, well be faced with a conflict between hislocal responsibilities and a call on his troops for operations in a country  for themilitary control of which he is in no way responsible.  Further, the difficult situation with which he may be faced is not rendered any easier by the fact that the  ultimate responsibility for military security in Palestine and in Egypt rests, at present, withtwro different Service Ministries in London.     It is therefore considered that  the responsibilities of the G.O.C.  British troopsin Egypt should be extended, so as  to include command of all the Military forces inPalestine.   In times of emergency,  the High  Commissioner will then be in a  positionto deal direct with a Military Officer who has been able to study  local problems andwho will be in a position to judge of the  military reinforcements which should besent to cope with the situation.    (vi) Finally, the War Office consider that the main defence problem of palestine and the composition of the garrison, Avhich is agreed to be  necessary, both  point tothe desirability of  vesting the command of the forces in a Military Officer.    Such an Officer should be responsible to the High Commissioner for both  internal security and external defence of the country.    If the forces  in  Trans-Jordan remain a separate  Command under  a  R.A.F.Officer, there is no reason to expect difficulties in  regard  to mutual support andco-operation.  On the other hand, if a single Military command for Trans-jordan and Palestine is decided upon, the Military  commander should, with the advice ofthe Senior R.A.F. Officer in regard to air matters, be able to deal with all problemsof internal and external security as efficiently  as the present Air Officer Commanding.
The views of the Air Ministry may be summarised as follows:      17. (i) Though the terms of reference of the Sub-Committee are concerned only with Palestine,  the problem of the military security of that country is indissolublyconnected with  that of Trans-Jordan, since  it is  the latter country which forms abuffer against external aggression, and in which forces for  defence  against suchaggression must principally be located.   Furthermore,  it is  from Trans-Jordan thatinroads on a considerable scale may be expected to come in support of renewed Arabaggression  against either  Jewish  communities or against the Government  itself.The forces which have hitherto been  provided for, and which have successfullyachieved, these purposes are Air Forces supported by armoured cars and local  levies,and there can  be no  doubt that the system employed  is the most economical and efficient  in  practice.   Should the  forces in Palestine  be separated from those inTrans-Jordan and placed  under  the  War  Office, much  overlapping of defenceresponsibilities Avould result, the power of rapid mutual reinforcement  would be lost,a duplication of headquarter staffs and ancillary services would be needed, and theHigh Commissioner himself would  have two military authorities with  which to deal in respect of two countries whose external defence problems are identical.     (ii)  It  is observed that the War  Office have  stressed the somewhat obviouslimitations  of aircraft in the support of civil power in large towns  and populousdistricts.  That land forces are preferable for this purpose is, and always has been,clearly  recognised by  the  Air  Staff.  But  it must equally  be  realised that  the justification for their presence is  that they  should  be immediately available  to reinforce the police in the event of serious disturbances.  Their functions are thus,as the events of last year proved, of a police rather than of a strictly military nature,and although they are numerically stronger than  the air and associated  units, this fact should not be regarded as one  connoting the assumption of control by the WarOffice.  The principal military problem in  this  as in other countries  is that  of external defence, and, as such, should remain an Air Ministry responsibility,  but itmay be  relevant to  remark that there is no intention that the infantry  forces operating in support of the police should be  placed under the direct command of a royal Air Force officer.  The present system under which there is an Officer Com-manding Military Forces (under the general control of the Air Officer Commanding)would be continued, and the Defence Scheme would,  of  course, be  prepared  inconjunction with this officer and (so far as reinforcements  are concerned) with themilitary authorities in Egypt.     (iii) It has  been suggested that the Air  Forces responsible for defence against external aggression should be subordinated to the military officer commanding thetroops responsible for  supporting  the civil  power in case  of internal disorder.There are serious objections to any such proposal.  The strengths of the Air Forcesin the various countries in  the Middle East have been calculated on  the assumptionthat they will be capable of rapid mutual reinforcement in emergency, and not one ofthem can be regarded alone  as sufficient for all possible  contingencies in the countryin which it is located.   Should the Air Forces in Palestine  and Trans-Jordan  be subordinated to  a military commander responsible to the War Office,  this power of rapid mutual reinforcement will be lost so far as those countries are concerned andthe strength of the Air Forces now  allotted to Middle Eastern countries will requirerecalculation in  order to provide a sufficient margin of safety for each.     (iv)  There is  a further objection to such a proposal.  The success  which hashitherto attended air operations in the undeveloped countries  of the Middle East is largely  attributable to the rapidity of  decision and subsequent action obtained  byclose and constant consultation  between the  Officer Administering the Governmentand the Commander of the Air Forces concerned.  By interposing an additional linkin the chain of command, this essential principle, which has constantly been stressedby the Air Staff, would be sacrificed, and they would be unable to accept that degreeof responsibility for the external defence of Trans-Jordan and Palestine by means ofair power vrhiofi they are confidently prepared to do under the.existing organisation.     (v) 1 he War Office have expressed the view that  an  Army officer  is just ascapable as an Air Force officer of exercising command over combined air and land forces, and they  point out that all senior Army officers are trained in the co-operation
The Control of Operations in the event of Reinforcements being sent to Palestine.     18.  This question is necessarily closely interlocked with the previous one.   Inthe event of command being transferred from the Air Ministry to the War Office,it would not arise, since reinforcements would in all probability be preponderatinglymilitary.of air with military forces.  Apart from the arguments contained in sub-paragraphs(iii) and (iv) above, the Air Ministry consider that this view, so far as it concerns theparticular circumstances of Palestine and Trans-Jordan, is based on a misconception.The policy underlying the employment of military units in support of the civil power is perfectly understood and is in no way controversial, since it approximates to thatgoverning police action.  Moreover, there would be no question of interference withthe methods adopted by the Officer Commanding the infantry force in Palestine; in point of fact, the two  Area Commanders in Palestine are placed in  direct contact with the  Political Officers controlling  those areas.  The principles  governing theemployment of air power, on the other hand, are neither well understood nor uncontro-versial.   In  Trans-Jordan,  the  air  operations  are not of the  nature  of  army co-operation in which senior Army officers are trained, since  they involve the employ-ment of air power as a primary offensive arm; such operations require constant and close control by the Air Officer Commanding, in consultation with the High Com-missioner, who has  himself placed considerable restrictions upon  their scope  undervarying circumstances.   There have, unfortunately, been several occasions upon  whichthe Air Staff have felt  compelled to comment on the incorrect principles upon  whichair power has been  applied in other spheres under the direction of military officers.Though it is perhaps natural that such cases should occur in the present stage  of airdevelopment, there is no doubt that for many years to come, the application  of airpower with efficiency and economy can  only be effected under the  guidance of those whose business it is to make a close and constant study of the principles involved.    (vi)  The War Office have referred to the situation that  would arise in the eventof further reinforcements being despatched to Palestine, under which it might bedeemed necessary to vest the control of  operations in a Military Officer as was donelast August.  They maintain that it is unsound and illogical to rely on one systemwhen things go well and to adopt another when troubles break  out.   The Air Staffmust point out that an exactly similar situation might arise if control were  trans-ferred to the  War  Office; external  aggression  might  well develop  to  an extentdemanding the reinforcement of  the air units in Trans-Jordan and Palestine,  andthe balance of responsibility might thereby be so changed as to justify the assumption of operational control by the Air Ministry.  The decision as to the department  whichshould be in control under normal circumstances cannot, in the view of the Air Staff,be  dictated by hypothetical  contingencies.  It  is no  more  likely  that  further reinforcements will be required in Palestine than in Iraq, and a literal acceptance ofthe War Office contention would  imply that military control in Iraq should also betransferred to the War Office merely because the Defence Scheme in force in thatcountry involves the despatch of  army reinforcements.   It will  be appreciated thatthe respective responsibilities of  the Services are bound to vary from time to timeunder stress of circumstances.    (vii)  Finally, no survey of the relative merits of War  Office  and Air Ministrycontrol would be complete- without a reference to departmental reactions at  home.Under the existing  regime the  Colonial Office  have, generally speaking, a  singleservice department, namely,  the Air Ministry, acting as their agents in  respect ofthe Middle Eastern countries for which they are responsible, i.e., Iraq,  Palestine,Trans Jordan and Aden.   The advantages of this  arrangement  are obvious,  andfurnish the principal reason underlying the invitation to  the Air Ministry bj^ theColonial Office in 1922 to act as their agents in Palestine and Trans-Jordan.   Notthe least of  the drawbacks of a transference of this agency  to the War Office would lie in the fact that the  Service Department responsible for dealing with the constantincidents on the  frontiers of Nejd and Hejaz  would,  in  the  case of the eastern frontier, be the Air Ministry, and, in that of the Western  frontier, the War Office.
    If it is decided that an officer of the R.A.F.  should  remain in command  in normal times of peace, the Committee are of opinion that effect should be given tothe recommendation of the Chiefs of Staff at their  meeting of  the 11th December,1925.   This  recommendation was that,  &quot; as  a matter  of principle, when  theoperations of a  British force become dependent primarily  on the land forces,  the command should rest with a Military officer, the same principle applying,  Mutatis Mutandis, to the forces of the other Services.&quot;                                        (Signed)      PASSFIELD.

(C.I.D. Paper No. 345-C-also P.G.S. 2.)                                 APPENDIX.  Letter from  the Colonial Office to the Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence,                                 with Enclosures.  (77023/30.)  Sir,                                            Downing Street, May 12, 1930.      I  AM directed by Lord Passfield to transmit to you, to be laid before the  Committee of Imperial Defence, the following extract (Enclosure No. 1)  from the  draft Minutes of the First Meeting of the Palestine Cabinet Committee relating to  garrison questions in Palestine.  A copy is also enclosed (Enclosure No. 2) of the note  by the Secretary of State on the subject, which is referred to in the draft Minutes.      2.   It will be observed that the Committee agreed to Lord Passfield&apos;s proposal  to refer  to the Committee of Imperial Defence,  for the favour of their advice, the  following three questions :       (1) The  strength,  composition, &amp;c, of the future garrison in Palestine;      (2) The  suggested transfer of control from the Air Ministry to the War Office;             and      (3) The  control of  operations  in  the event of reinforcements  being sent ta             Palestine.      3.   In this connection reference is invited to the extract from the  Report of  the Commission  on the Palestine Disturbances, quoted at the beginning of the  Secretary of State&apos;s note  (Enclosure No.  2)  referred to above.  The Commission  suggested that the  question of the most  suitable form of  garrison  for  Palestine  should be  considered by the appropriate  advisers  of His Majesty&apos;s Government,  whose  attention   should   be  drawn  to  the   views  expressed  to  them  by  Air Vice-Marshal Dowding and Brigadier Dobbie.  Those views have already been  communicated to the Committee of Imperial Defence in the copy of the transcript  of notes of  evidence given  by  the two officers  concerned before  the Commissioa  (Enclosure  No.  3).   Attention  is also  invited  to  the  accompanying  extract  (Enclosure No.  4) from a  despatch from the High  Commissioner  for  Palestine,  dated  the 17th  January,  1930,  in which Sir  J.  Chancellor  discusses  garrison  questions.  A copy of the Memorandum referred  to in paragraph 92 of the despatch  is also enclosed (Enclosure No. 5).   It will  be seen that Sir J. Chancellor considers        (a)  that the permanent garrison of Palestine should include two battalions of             British Infantry, with the necessary ancillary services;       (&amp;)  that responsibility for  public  security  in Palestine should  be transferred             from the Air Ministry to the War Office;       (c) that for  defence purposes Palestine should be made part of the Egyptian             military command.       4.   The position  with regard to the  re-organisation of the police is that the!1 Secretary of State is still awaiting the final report by Mr. H. L. Dowbiggin.  As,  however, is  pointed out in the Secretary  of State&apos;s note  to the Palestine Cabinet  Committee (Enclosure No.  2), there appears to be no necessity to defer consideration  of garrison  questions pending  the receipt of that report,  since Mr.  Dowbiggin&apos;s  views  on police questions, in so far as they affect the garrison, have  already been  received in  his  preliminary statement of recommendations with  regard to the  distribution  of British police and the protection of Jewish Colonies.  These  views  are given in the Secretary of State&apos;s note referred to above (Enclosure No. 2).       5.   Lord Passfield would be glad if the Committee of Imperial Defence would  be good  enough to consider questions (1) and (2) referred to in paragraph 2 of this  letter  in the light  of the considerations  set out above, and  furnish their  advice  thereon.  A despatch has recently been received from the High Commissioner for  Palestine forwarding  a  copy of a letter sent to the Air Ministry by the Air Officer  Commanding, Palestine and Trans-Jordan, outlining the proposed  distribution  of
the Military  and Air  Forces to provide for the internal security of Palestine.Copies of that despatch and enclosure (Enclosure No. 6) are forwarded herewith, asthe information given therein may be of assistance to the Committee of  ImperialDefence in the consideration of the above two questions.    6.  In the event of the Committee of Imperial Defence advising against the suggested transfer of control from the Air Ministry to the War Office, Lord Passfieldwould be  glad of their  advice on the third question referred to in paragraph 2 ofthis letter, namely,  the control of operations in the event of reinforcements being sent to Palestine.  This question was raised in paragraph 2 of a letter addressed bythe War Office to the Colonial Office, dated the 20th February, 1930, a copy of which forms Enclosure No. 7  to this letter.  The question would not, of course, arise inthe event  of responsibility for public security in Palestine being transferred fromthe Air Ministry to the War Office.                                                   I am, &amp;c.                                                      O. G. R.  WILLIAMS.
                               ENCLOSURE No. 1.   Extract from the Draft Minutes of the First Meeting of the Palestine Cabinet                            Committee, May 1, 1930.                     tr           -Jv-          vv           -TV-TAe Garrison in Palestine.     The Committee had before them a Note by the Secretary of State for the Coloniesdealing with the strength, composition, &amp;c, of the future garrison of Palestine, andthe responsibility for public security in that country.     LORD  PASSFIELD said that he proposed,  with  the  concurrence of theCommittee,  to  refer  these  questions  to the  Committee  of  Imperial Defence.Referring to the suggestion that responsibility for public security should be trans-ferred from the Air Ministry to the War Office, he asked Lord Thomson for his views.     LORD  THOMSON said that the point was whether  external and  internaldefence were to be separated into two departments  involving two headquarters inPalestine.  As he understood ife, the chief Arab danger was the  influx of Arabs overthe Trans-Jordan  border into Palestine  for the purpose of murdering Jews.  Theonly effective way to stop this ingress was by means of an air force in Trans-Jordan.The other problem to be  faced was a question of keeping order in the towns inPalestine.  Admittedly, the Air Force could not deal  with this, and  the answerappeared to  be  an efficient  police force.  He suggested it was bad both from themilitary and political point of view to keep soldiers in Palestine for maintaininginternal order.   If responsibility for public security in Palestine was transferred tothe War Office, either two headquarters would have to  be maintained, or the WarOffice would have to take over the defence of the Trans-Jordan frontier, which, he considered, was a purely air proposition.  To defend this frontier with troops wouldbe a very large military commitment, and,  up to date, all attempts  at invasion hadbeen effectively and cheaply  dealt with by the Air Force.     Mr. SHAW said he did not see why, if circumstances had changed, the limitedair force in Trans-Jordan should not  be put under  the military command inPalestine, just  as the  Air Officer  Commanding was  now  commanding  the  two battalions in Palestine.     LORD THOMSON replied that, owing to  their lack  of special training and experience, military officers could not be expected to direct the operations of air unitsas effectively as Royal Air Force Officers.    Mr. HENDERSON asked why the defence of Trans-Jordan should not continue on the same lines as at present.    LORD PASSFIELD observed that, in his Paper,  there was no proposal that both  Trans-Jordan and Palestine should  be  brought under the  same military command. He read an extract from the letter to the Treasury (P.C. (30) 3) regardingthe cost of the Trans-Jordan frontier force.  Palestine was not in a position to meetunaided the burden of maintaining the police force, and of making a contribution onthe present bases towards the cost of the Trans-Jordan frontier force (five-sixths)and  the British  forces stationed in Palestine and  Trans-Jordan (excess  cost).  TheHigh Commissioner had, therefore, asked that Palestine should now bear not morethan two-fifths of the cost of the Trans-Jordan frontier  force.    LORD  THOMSON observed  that the War  Office wanted  to  place  the  two battalions now in Palestine, which it seemed might have to remain there indefinitely,under the Egyptian command.  To his mind the big  question was whether we were going to continue using infantry battalions for the preservation of internal order inMandated Territories.    Mr SHAW said he was quite aware  of the political  objections to  the  use oftroops for this purpose, but  so long as there was no alternative they would have toremain there.  Nothing would please the War Office more than to withdraw the two
battalions, and he knew that the C.I.G.S. was strongly in favourof internal securitybeing undertaken by police forces.  So long, however, as the troops were in Palestine,the natural centre of control  appeared to be the military headquarters in Egypt.He was not prepared to enter  into technical reasons, which,  he suggested, should bedealt with by the Committee of Imperial Defence.     LORD PASSFIELD, referring to the use of police for internal security, saidthat Mr. Dowbiggin had recommended an increase of the white police in Palestine toabout 750, in order to provide more security for the numerous  scattered Jewishcolonies.  Even with this  increase he could not garrison  more than a proportion ofthe colonies, and for this reason it had been decided to retain sealed armouries underthe control of the village  headmen.  There was no intention of dispersing the two infantry battalions unduly.     MR. SHAW remarked that the main objections to  sealed armouries was thatthey provided irresponsible people with deadly weapons.                                 CONCLUSIONS.     (i)  It was agreed that Lord Passfield should refer to the Committee of ImperialDefence the questions  raised in Paper  No.  P.C. (30) 5* regarding the garrison inPalestine and the transfer of  responsibility for public  security, together with all necessary information  regarding the  police dispositions.

I  WOULD invite attention to the following extract from the Report of theCommission on the Palestine disturbances of August 1929 (page 145) :          &quot; The events of August last clearly established  that  for the duties of    checking widespread disturbances and restoring&quot; order in Palestine infantry are    more effective than are  either aeroplanes or  armoured  cars.  On  the  wider    question whether  aeroplanes and  armoured cars are  the most suitable  form of    garrison for  Palestine there was direct conflict between the evidence of the    experts who appeared before us,  and we can only suggest  that  this  question    should be considered by the appropriate advisers of His Majesty&apos;s Government,    whose attention should,  we consider, be drawn  to the views expressed  to us by    Air Vice-Marshal Dowding and Brigadier Dobbie.         We recommend that, until  the question  of the form of the  future  garrison    has been decided, and thereafter until racial feeling in Palestine has shown some    marked improvement,  no reduction should be made in the present garrison of    two battalions of infantry.&quot;    Apart  from  the  above  question, there have also been  raised the questions(a) whether the responsibility for the defence of Palestine should not be transferred from  the Air Ministry  to the  War Office, and (b)  whether, without altering thepresent general  arrangements, the  control of operations in the event of reinforce-ments  being sent  to  Palestine, should not be vested in  the hands of  a  military commander. The first question was raised by the High Commissioner for palestine in a Confidential despatch, dated  the 17th January,  1930, which  I  circulated tcmembers of the Cabinet under cover of a memorandum, dated the 27th March, 1930                      * Printed as Enclosure No. 2 to this document.
                               ENCLOSURE No. 3.  Transcript of Notes and Evidence by Brigadier Bobbie and Air Vice-Marshal           Dowding given in camera before the Commission of Inquiry                                      I.                                   SUMMARY.                        (Prepared by Brigadier Dobbie.)    1.   THE defence force for Palestine  should be calculated separately from thatfor Trans-Jordania.    2.   Experience has shown that Palestine has an external as well as an internalproblem.    3.   The defence of Palestine should be entrusted to the Army rather than to theRoyal Air Force.(C.P. 108 (30) ).  In that despatch Sir John Chancellor expressed the following views with regard to the garrison :     1. That the permanent garrison in Palestine should include two battalions of           British infantry with the necessary ancillary services.    2. That responsibility for public  security in Palestine should be transferred           from the Air Ministry to the War Office.    3. That for defence purposes Palestine  should be made part of the Egyptian           military command.    Question (b) was raised in paragraph 5 of a letter addressed by the War Officeto the Air Ministry, 0176/317 (M.O. 2), dated the 20th  February,  1930 (EnclosureNo. 7).    As my colleagues on the Sub-Committee are no doubt aware, Mr. H. L. Dowbiggin,Inspector-General of Police,  Ceylon, is at present in Palestine for the purpose of advising on the organisation of the Palestine police.  I have not yet received his final report.  He has, however, submitted a preliminary statement of his recommendations with  regard to the distribution of British police  and the protection of Jewishcolonies.   These  recommendations,  which  I have  approved,  are based  on  the assumptions (1) that military and British police will be required in Palestine for atleast  20  years; (2) that the  garrison  will  include  2 Infantry  battalions,  and2 companies of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force, as well as the Royal Air Force and armoured  Cars.  It appears that, in Mr. Dowbiggin&apos;s opinion, it will take at least20 years,  under the most favourable  conditions, to attain a reasonable state  of efficiency among the Palestinian police; that the functions of the police  should be toprevent disturbances-wherever possible; and that the  military should  be called into assist the civil power only when the  necessity arises.   In view of the information given in Mr.  Dowbiggin&apos;s preliminary statement,  it seems  unnecessary to deferconsideration of questions relating to the garrison pending the receipt of his reporton the organisation of the police.  I am of  the opinion that these questions can mostsuitably be examined by  the Committee of Imperial Defence.  Subject, therefore,to the concurrence of my colleagues, I propose to refer  to that body the following questions :      (1) The strength, composition, &amp;c, of the future garrison.     (2) The suggested transfer of control from the Air Ministry to the War Office.     (3) The  control  of operations in the event  of reinforcements being  sent to           Palestine.                                                          (Initialled)       P.    Colonial Office,  May  1, 1930.
    4.  Royal Air Force units by themselves are not suited to the duties required inPalestine.  They may be more suited to Trans-Jordania.    (a) Aeroplanes,  naturally, cannot be allowed  to  develop their full  offensive           power, i.e., bombs and machine-gun fire.    (b) Aeroplane action cannot but be indiscriminate.   Difficult to distinguish           friend from  foe.    (c) Aeroplanes cannot operate effectively at night when trouble is most likely           to occur.    id) Armoured cars  are restricted to  roads.  Many parts of the country cannot           be influenced by them. Their  influence extends simply to their immediate           neighbourhood.    (e) Uneconomical to use them for static duties.    (/) The people of the country have realised these  limitations, and moral effect           of aeroplanes and  armoured cars is consequently greatly diminished.    5.  Two British battalions (one at  Jerusalem and one at  Haifa),  and somearmoured cars  should be normal garrison.  N.B. Possible  one battalion might bereplaced by a cavalry regiment but this  would not be quite  so good.    6.  Bolice: (a) Bulk of police should be recruited from outside Palestine.                 (b) Number of British  police should be considerably increased to                         say 600.                                      II.Evidence of  Brigadier  Dobbie  given before  the Chairman and  Members of  the  Palestine Commission of Inquiry  in camera on Wednesday, November 6, 1929.    CHAIRMAN :  We have got to make recommendations on the matter of safe-guarding the country from disturbances of this nature in the future ? A. Yes.    Q. So we  wanted to  ask you from your experience in  the country which  you.think would  be the  correct way in which to protect  the people of Palestine from further outbreaks of this  nature. A. You know I am not in command here now soit is a little difficult for  me to give advice.    CHAIRMAN :  You have seen what trouble arises and it would be very valuableto us  to have your opinion on the subject.    SIR HENRY  BETTERTON: The difficulty the  General  is  in-A.  Mypersonal opinion as  Brigadier Dobbie I  should be glad to give you, but Air Vice-Marshal Dowding is my chief and it is for him to tender official advice.    CHAIRMAN :  We can  ask his opinion as well, but there is no reason why you should not give yours. A. I should be glad to give you my views. I have already given them to him and he has forwarded them to the Air Ministry.    Q. I think we had  better see him too, but I think we should like  to hear yours. A.  You want it in very  general terms I take it.     Q. We will see  what  you tell us and then we can put any questions we wish toput. A. There were two things that struck me.  The defence force of this country was lumped in with  that of Trans-Jordan before the troubles began.   It was Trans-Jordan and  Palestine  together and so many aeroplanes  and armoured cars wereallotted to them together.  I think the  problems of  the two  countries are so very different from each  other that I think the  defence forces  for the two ought to be calculated separately.  That is the first point.  As regards Palestine I have nodoubt in my mind that the proper kind  of force to have here is an army  force  andnot an air force. The air units that they have here, the aeroplanes  and the armoured cars which are the only two kinds of things that they can have, neither of them, eitherseparately or together,  can fill  the  bill.   Aeroplanes  are really a bluff.   The  only thing they can do is to drop bombs or to shoot with their  machine-guns  and their action is extremely indiscriminate and the people of this country,  I am pretty sure,have  now taken their measure, have now realised that they are a bluff.   I cannotimagine that we  would  never  be  willing  to use their  full  powers  because  it  isunthinkable.   They are indiscriminate.   Armoured cars can only get where thereare good roads or reasonably  good roads and the crew in the  armoured  car is so smallit cannot get out and do something at some distance off. The armoured car can  just
exert influence in its own immediate vicinity.  There are lots of places which theycannot go to in the country and if you wanted to make its influence felt reasonablywidely you would have to have a tremendous lot of them which would be very expen-sive and even so they would not be able to fill their purpose.     Q.  And as to riots in towns? A.  In towns like the old City of Jerusalem theyare useless.     Q.  And aeroplanes  and armoured cars? A. Aeroplanes  and  armoured cars,they are not, generally  speaking, suitable.  They are highly  mobile things; theycannot naturally  stay in one particular place.  It is a great waste of effort to keep an armoured car stationary in one place.  Its value is in being able to get from one place to another quickly, but there are cases  where you need to have people staying in a place and armoured cars are not the right sort of tiling for that&quot;     MR. SNELL :  When you are thinking of an armoured car are you thinking of infantry ? A. I  mean an armoured car with one machine gun in a turret.     Q.  I meant  in  your advocacy of  an. army rather than an  air force you arethinking of an infantry force ? A. I think there should be an infantry force here,an  army force.  The air force, for some reason,  have  armoured cars as part andparcel of their force, but, of course, the army have armoured cars as well.  If theair force is responsible for  the defence of the country all the things they  have gotto put are either  aeroplanes or armoured cars and neither of them, I am convinced,will meet the case.   We have proved it, and found it is so.     CHAIRMAN:  There would have to be beside that  a  reliable  police  force ? A.  The defence force will be the reserve to the police.     Q.  You think it is absolutely necessary  to have a reserve force of  infantry? A.  I think  so, yes,  I think so.  If I  were responsible, if  I were the High  Com-missioner, I would not be happy without such a force.     Q.  How many  do you  think  there should  be? A. Normally, I  think  two battalions.  I think that  we might have attached to the infantry a small number of armoured cars to  operate on the frontiers, but they could be army armoured cars or air force armoured cars,  whichever happened to be convenient, but the infantry, inmy opinion, must be the main part.     Q.  You would not propose doing away with the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force? A. No; they do not belong really to this country. They really belong to the other side, but I think  you want British units here.  That is another thing.  I think youwant British units.  The Trans-Jordan frontier  force consists of native personnel.It has British officers, but in the circumstances which prevail in this country, wherethere is the  Jew and the  Arab, neither of them trusting each other,  the only personthey will trust is an Englishman, and I think the force, whatever  it is, should be british.     Q.  Both here and  in Trans-Jordan? A. I mean Palestine.  I am only talkingof Palestine.  I think the air force could continue  to operate in Trans-Jordan.  Thecircumstances there are more suitable for their operations.  It is more open country.There are not the big towns and there is not the possibility of rioting as there is inPalestine.     Q. Have you any  views about the number of British police there  ought to behere? A. They ought to be very much larger than they have been.  There is noquestion about that.  It  is rather difficult for me to say  the number, but  I should think, as a very wild shot, it should be in the neighbourhood of six or seven hundred,something of that kind.     Q.  Those would have to be concentrated in towns.  There are no places  for themto live in small detachments in the villages ? A. I have not really thought out thepolice dispositions in any detail, but I would also suggest  this about the police, thatthe non-British police  should not be recruited locally and if possible not be eitherMoslem or Jew.  It is rather difficult to find anyone  to  fill the bill, certainly notlocally.     Q.  Even in the  towns? A. You could have a certain  number  for just simplethings like traffic control, the ordinary  little things, but if  you want to depend on them in a pinch,  the local people I think will not be reliable.
                                      It)    MR.  SNELL :  That is to say, should not serve in the locality in which they arerecruited? A. I think they should be non-Palestinian.    CHAIRMAN : Except those used for purely police duties in towns ? A. Yes,the minor things, but  for really keeping order when things are in a dangerous state think experience has proved you cannot,  generally speaking, rely on them.  Theyare a sword that may pierce your own hand.    MR.  SNELL:  I  just wanted  to complete  one thing.   You  thought  two battalions normally, by that you mean in case acute trouble  did arise there  wouldbe time to get reinforcements here if needed from Malta or Egypt ? A. I think  two battalions, except in exceptional circumstances, will prevent troubles arising.   Thereis one other point, I do not know whether this will come into your purview, but fromthe point of view of administration, it would be infinitely easier to have the militaryforces, if they were here, under the General Officer Commanding Egypt.   We are finding great difficulties,  or rather inconveniences, from the point  of view of theadministrative problems that arise, because we are not his child and we are in anunnatural situation.  In Egypt you will, I take  it, have soldiers responsible for thedefence of that country.  This is an adjoining country.  If soldiers are also respon-sible for the defence of this country it seems the simplest arrangement that the  twoshould be under the one higher command.  I do not know whether that comes intoyour purview.CHAIRMAN :  Yes, it is all part of the problem, I think.    SIR HENRY BETTERTON :  Your view is, is it, that there should be two battalions, in addition, do you say, to six hundred British police ? A. Yes.    Q. Permanently? A.  Yes.    Q. Now is there at present accommodation for two battalions in this country ? A.  No, we are building some now.   We are building some accommodation here forhalf a battalion, but I have told them to lay out that plan of huts in such a way thatthe other half could be added to it if it should be necessary.    MR.  SNELL: In what neighbourhood ? A. Here  in Jerusalem, at Talpioth,and the same  in Haifa.  We are building a camp there for half  a battalion also.I have told them that they must  so put their huts and  things that they can, ifnecessary, add another half.    CHAIRMAN : What  about Jaffa ? A.  When things come to normal again,  Ithink we ought to have each battalion concentrated,  and if there was any necessityat any time to send  a company to Jaffa or Nablus or anywhere else, you can  send them in temporary accommodation like we have at present.    SIR HENRY BETTERTON :  Of course, in relation  to the size of the countryand to the amount of the population of the country as a permanent defensive force,two battalions of infantry  and six hundred British police would seem a very largedefence force, would it not, having  regard to the size of  this country, which onlycontains  between eight and nine hundred thousand people ? A. I was not able to speak very plainly in my evidence I gave in court, because  there were things I couldnot disclose.  If  I may  speak very plainly,  the  threat to this  country fromTrans-Jordan and from Syria and from Sinai was a very very real one, and that wasthe thing that was at the back of my mind at the time.   When I was pressed bySir Boyd Merriman I did not think it right to go into these  details, but when I said Iwould still do the same, I would.   It was a very very real  threat, and if that threathad materialised or even gone a little bit  further towards materialising,  we shouldhave wanted far more troops than we had got.    Q. That is one of the points I wanted to put to you in private.  It is suggested I want your view about this it is suggested by Sir Boyd Merriman that the airforce  should have been sent for from Amman several  days  before it was, many days,four or five days before it was.  Would not the effect of removing the air force fromAmman  at an earlier  date have encouraged these bands,  which were deliberatelywondering whether they should cross the Jordan or not ? A . I do not think it wouldhave mattered very much at that precise time, because these bands,  as far as I could see, did not come into being until the troubles took place here.  They were broughtinto being by some extraordinary rumours circulating in the Syrian press and else-where, that the Jews had bombed  the Mosque of Omar.   It was those things that had credence in Trans-Jordan and elsewhere that did  all the harm.
     Q. Not the 23rd? A. Yes, two or three days afterwards.  That is why, when Mr. Preedy asked me did I have any preoccupations  about  Trans-Jordan at the moment I took over command, I had not.  Perhaps I ought to have had, but I did not tumble to it then, I did a few days later, and if these reports had circulated among the tribes there and gained credence        Q. Do you think there is a serious threat now, has  this danger gone ? A.  Not that particular one, but one has seen how extraordinary credulous these people  are. They will believe  anything their own people tell them.   If any ill-disposed person wanted to create  trouble (he could very very easily do  it, and that is a very  real danger, T think, and it is not only preventing the Jews and Arabs in Palestine from getting to each others  throats, it is all the other Arabs  from outside coming in  and joining them.     Q. And the possibility of that situation arising again is  the main reason why you think two battalions should be  permanently  stationed here ? A. One of tihe reasons, and I think we should calculate the two forces separately for Trans-Jordan and Palestine, so that whatever  is considered necessary for Trans-Jordan shall operate in that  country.  A lot of them came over here.  All their armoured cars came over here.  Shortly after I took over command I sent  the Royal Air Force armoured cars back to Trans-Jordan in order to try and deal  with these threats as far as I could.     Q. The two battalions that you have in mind, you do not contemplate you would need  them for  suppressing  riots and rows  here, but as a defence against Trans- Jordan? A. Both.  As you know, probably better than I do, the material in  this country, is so very inflammable, and  it has been made  more  inflammable by these extraordinary happenings, any little thing would set it off.    Q. Now  you  think  that the police,  the  non-British  police, should not be Palestinian ? A.  A large portion should not be.    Q. Have you any races or any part near here or anywhere near these parts, have you in mind, for instance, the Assyrians ? A. I do not know enough about this part of the world,  but I am told there are some people called Assyrians, and that  they are suitable.  They are Moslems.  I believe they have been used in Irak very successfully for the same sort of purpose, and the  Circassians,  I believe they are very good,  too. You want to have people who, in the case of real necessity, would not hestitate to shoot.    Q. And you have no doubt,  from what you have seen and from what you have been told, that the Palestinian local police did fail? A.  In some cases I am quite sure they did.    : Q. You think  the Palestinian police are no good in the case of a racial disturbance- bance ? A. No.                                                            - -    Q. Is it the fact that where you have, in a country like this, police and army, assuming two battalions and a large force of police, the police are much more  apt to fly to the military for assistance  to suppress disturbances  than they otherwise would be?  They are not so self-reliant as they would be without the military force behind them?-A..  I don&apos;t think so.  In England it is the case that you have police and a large force.of military in the country.  They are there if  the police want help,but I  do not think  it affects the quality of the police work.  I think it adds to their reliability.                                     III.   Air Vice-Marshal Hugh Caswall Tremenheere Dowding called and examined                                 in Camera.    CHAIRMAN  : How long have you  known Palestine ? A,  Only since I caswsout here, about two months.    Q. You have not been here before &apos;(-^-A. No.                    -    Q. And you are in command how of the forces ? A.  Yes    Q. I suppose you have been over tne conn cry since you have  been here ? -A . Yes.
     Q. Have you formed any opinion as to what are the necessities of the country as far as military protection is concerned in the future ? A.  Yes.     Q. Will you kindly tell us what you think ? A,. Will you read this letter before I give my report ?                           (After reading the letter.)     CHAIRMAN :  I do not know that we should go very far into it in our report. It is largely a matter for  the War Office.  It will have to be forwarded with the confidential papers to the Government.     MR. HOPKIN MORRIS : May we hear what is in the letter ?     CHAIRMAN :  The Air  Vice-Marshal says that some  of the facts that affect the situation are secret, and some are of such a controversial nature that his personal views may not necessarily coincide with those eventually adopted by the Air Ministry.     AIR VICE-MARSHAL DOWDING : I ask you to give me an undertaking to the effect that my views shall not appear in your Report, as a  condition of my giving you a frank and full expression of my opinions.  If you are  unable to give me such an undertaking, I must confine myself  to matters which can be  published  without detriment to the service.            (After further discussion the Air Vice-Marshal continued.)     I have prepared a statement  which I  think will be of assistance to you.  I will send a copy of this statement to the Air Ministry, and say this is what I have told the Commission.  If I have expressed any view which does not accurately reflect the opinions of  the Air Ministry,  the latter can correct it with the Colonial  Office, andalso arrange to withhold publication at their discretion.     CHAIRMAN :  I think that would be a very satisfactory way of dealing with it. A. I will read my report to you now.     1. In considering the problem of defending the people of Palestine against theresults of outbreaks,&quot; the first step naturally consists in thinking out what can bedone to remove grievances, and  in other ways to reduce  the probability of  therecrudescence of past troubles.     2. The  next step is to ensure that an adequate system of  Intelligence shall exist in the  country, so that  due warning of  impending trouble may be obtained.     3. Finally, we may consider what  armed forces should be maintained, to dealwith troubles when they arise.     4. The  political issue is not within my province, except in so far as the defenceof the country would  be simplified  by  a  modification of the manner in which the balfour Declaration is applied, and by  Government audit of  the Waqf funds whichare at present used to subsidise political propaganda.     5. The  Intelligence System of both Palestine and Transjordan is vested in the Police, which are in the former case predominantly, and in the latter case entirely,Moslem.  A Moslem Police Intelligence System may serve well enough for CriminalInvestigation,  anti-Communist precautions and Tribal Control,  but it  is almost certain to break down when it  is  required to  expose machinations, religious or political, which are essentially Moslem  in character.     6. I consider, therefore, that a small Intelligence Organization should be at thedisposal of  the Commander of the  Forces, who can in no  case be content to relyentirely on  information supplied to him by the Civil Authorities.  This would prevent his being taken by surprise by subversive developments, and the information obtained by him would afford a valuable check to the  Civil Authorities on  the intelligence  obtained by their own systems.     7. The  problem of deciding  the strength and composition of the Garrison of. Palestine is a complicated  one, since it is intimately connected with the defence of Transjordan, and the defence of Palestine against incursions from Transjordan,and, to a lesser extent,  from Syria.
    8. In  any ease, the primary consideration is the strength,  composition  and efficiency of the Palestine Police.  This force, at the beginning of the recent troubles,consisted of something under 1,400 local police, of whom nearly  900 were Arabs.The British Section was only 170 strong.    9. The native police, though theoretically adequate in numbers, and efficient fortheir  every-day duties, collapsed under  the stress  of circumstances and  becamepractically valueless.    10. The Police Officers and the British Section performed prodigies;  but theirsmall numbers prevented them from  controlling the situation  by their individualexertions, or from infecting the native police with their own courage.    11. The immediate need, therefore, would appear to be to augment the numbersof the British Section and to modify their distribution and the  mode of their employment so that British influence may have  a more  widespread effect on thetraining and moral of the native police.    12. A scheme for police reorganization is in course of preparation, but I havenot yet had an opportunity of seeing it.    13. Any  such reorganization of the Arab  Legion  (the  Police Force of trans-Jordan) is at present out of the question on financial grounds.  This Legion isa purely Arab force, containing only two British officers, and run on oriental lines.It possesses a  certain rough effectiveness,  and is very cheap.    14. The Palestine Police must be  adequate in numbers and organization to  dealpromptly   and  efficiently  with   any but very  abnormal  demonstrations  anddisturbances.  They,must also be capable of dealing with minor trans-frontier raids against Palestine settlements.    15.  In theory they should also be capable of  defending all communities inPalestine against local aggression; but it must be remembered that there are nearly140 Jewish colonies in Palestine, mostly in somewhat isolated positions.    16.  It  may prove, therefore,  too expensive to  increase the  police force  to  suchan extent;  and a system is now under consideration by which the Jews may assist in their own defence by means of sealed armouries containing shot guns for defensive purposes only.  Pyrotechnic signals and  wire defences might  be auxiliary to theabove.    17.  Such a system is theoretically unsound, but it may be necessary to adopt iton financial grounds.    18.  Assuming that the Palestine Police Force can adequately-perform the dutiesoutlined in paragraph 14 above, and  that the deficiencies of the Arab Legion inTrans-Jordan are made up by the existence of the Trans-Jordan  Frontier Force(whose strength and composition are presumably outside the province of this paper),I am of the opinion that a mobile or mobilised force of the equivalent of one battalion of Infantry will be required in Palestine to deal  with situations which cannot becoped with by the Civil Authorities.    19.  There will also be required, for the two countries, one Squadron of bomber aircraft and four Sections of Armoured  Cars (four cars in each).    20.  I dp not maintain that this garrison is adequate for all emergencies; butPalestine can  be easily reinforced from Egypt, Malta,  or  (in the case of Royal AirForce units) Traq : and the garrison  which I have recommended should suffice forall ordinary emergencies, and, in graver circumstances, should prevent the situation from deteriorating irrevocably pending the arrival of assistance from neighbouringcommands.    21.  Pending the reorganization of the Police Force, the  existing  garrison of.two Battalions, two Squadrons of aircraft and four Sections of Armoured Cars, withancillary services, should be retained.    CHAIRMAN : Under the present conditions there should be.two battalionsA. Yes.  -  -    MR. SNELL ; What did you mean by a, mobile battalion; what does that meantechnically? A. I meant a mobile or mobilised  force equivalent in  size to one
  battalion.   They might be cavalry or they might be such as they are now, infantry  with lorries always  standing  by.  It is an essential that they should be able to  get quickly about the country.      CHAIRMAN :  With mechanical transport ? A. Yes.      Q. You do not say how many British Police  you think would be necessary?   A. That is not my province, and until I have seen the proposals for reorganisation  now being prepared I can give no opinion.      Q. It  depends rather on the strength of the army? A. No,  I  am absolutely  against you there.  The first thing is that the police should be strong enough and  well enough trained to perform the normal duties of the police  and that is the end  you ought  to start from.  When they can do that, then I can make an estimate of  how many troops will be required for abnormal conditions when the troops are called  out in aid of the civil power,  but if you start from the  other  end, start  with  the  troops that are going  to be in the country, then you are going to rely on the troops to  do police duties, which is entirely wrong.     MR. SNELL : So your estimate of the military strength would depend on how  far the police force was reorganised on  an efficient  basis ? A.  I am assuming  the police forces will be organised and augmented so that they can carry out efficiently the duties that I have enumerated there.  If for any reason the police forces were not adequate to perform these duties then the figures I have given for a permanent garrison would be insufficient.   In other words, it would mean  some troops would have to be doing the police work all the time,  which is undesirable.  They are doing police work now.     SIR HENRY BETTERTON : You begin by saying in the first paragraph : &quot; The first  step to that  consists  in thinking out  what can be  done to  remove grievances.&quot;  Obviously, the amount of  the collective force, military  and police, would to some  extent  depend upon policy.   If the  grievances are to some extent removed, it would not be so necessary to have so large a force ? A.  I will put it rather in this way; that the forces I have recommended, I think, are adequate to deal with any situation which is likely to arise, not permanently, but until  reinforcements can be sent.  If  the grievances are not removed, the crisis is much more likely  to arise. Put it that way; not that you want more forces, but you will more likely have to use them.     CHAIRMAN :  That is provided the police are strong enough to do the ordinary police duties, one of which is to suppress riots? A. Yes, suppress what you may call ordinary disturbances.     Q.  Disturbances here are rather different from disturbances  in England.  They are the sort  of thing that is likely to  spread all over the country.  It is not like a row in the football field ? A. No.     MR. SNELL : Am I right in saying until the police is reorganised sufficiently you put an emphasis on the  present military strength being  retained? A.  Well, I won&apos;t say that, but I will say you cannot cut down to  one battalion.     Q.  There are two battalions? A. Yes, and a situation  might arise where you may say we  can get on with one battalion in  Jerusalem and a half a  battalion  in Haifa, or something like that.  I do not want to split hairs about  that,  but until the police is fully efficient, the ground force cannot be cut down to one battalion.     CHAIRMAN : By fully efficient you  mean being able to deal  with  any riot  that is likely to occur; is that  right? A. No,  not with  any riot that  is likely to occur,because in that  case you would not want  any  troops  at all.  The troops are in thecountry, and are made  mobile in order  that they may assist the police in riots whichare getting beyond their power to deal  with.     SIR HENRY BETTERTON :  I should like to ask a question or two. You sayyou consider there should be a small intelligence organisation which would be at thedisposal of the Commander of the forces. There is one now in the hands of the police ?-i-A. As a matter of fact, I have got one special service officer in  Trans-Jordan  andhis duties are primarily to obtain intelligence as  to what is  going on  on the other side of the frontier, in Nejd  and in Hedjaz.
     Q. But you have nobody here ? A. He is not supposed to concern himself with what is going- on in Trans-Jordan, and I have no intelligence officers or organisation in Palestine at all.     Q. Your idea is that there should be a sort of small security  section,  which would probably describe it, with liaison between the police and you ? A.  No, I want something of my own.     CHAIRMAN :  You want a special intelligence  system as apart from the Government? A. Certainly;  I want a military  intelligence  service.     Q. Has that ever been done in an English colony? A.  Certainly.     Q. In a place where there is an English Government? A.  Certainly,  in Iraq and in Egypt; in fact, I do not know a place where it is not done.    Q. Apart from the Government service ? A .  It is a Government  service because it is a military service.    MR. SNELL:  Not the Colonial Government \-A.  No.    CHAIRMAN :  It is very curious having two systems of intelligence ? A.  It is very useful as  a check on one another&apos;s information.    MR. SNELL :  Need that be a very extensive force ? A. No, I would ask for five officers.    SIR HENRY BETTERTON : Since you have been here, have you formed any conclusions as to how far there was  collaboration between the Arabs here and the Arabs  in Trans-Jordan? A.  My  opinion  is  that  this  thing blew  up  rather unexpectedly, at  any rate, as far as the Trans-Jordan people were concerned.   they made some rather belated efforts to take advantage of it, but they were too late, and the situation was got under control in Palestine before they had really got  going; but I think if another such incident occurred in Palestine that they would be muchmore ready for it in Trans-Jordan.   There are a number of free lances over  there,ex-Turkish officers, hangers-on  of Feisal in Damascus  and Ali in Jediah, they areout of a job now,  they have nothing to  lose and may have something to gain by trouble. Those fellows would all be on the look-out not only to come into Palestine, but to startsimilar troubles in Trans-Jordan.    Q. Do you think the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force is large enough ? A.  I have recommended a 25 per cent, increase.    Q. You do not think it was premeditated, but the whole situation was  ready for a spark ? A. Yes; this time the spark was the Wailing Wall. Last time it wasa Communist procession.    Q. Therefore it was only premeditated in that sense? A. Yes.                              ENCLOSURE No. 4.

In connection with the question of the organisation of the public security forces, I enclose a Memorandum setting forth the decisions that have been taken byHis Majesty&apos;s Government since 1925 in regard to the establishments of the public security  forces  in Palestine  and  Trans-Jordan,  and  describing  the   defence arrangements generally (Enclosure II).*                    * Reproduced as Enclosure1 &quot;No. 5 of this document.
     93.   At the beginning of August 1929  the distribution of the air and military- forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan was as follows :      (a)  Amman            Command H.Q., Palestine and Trans-Jordan.           H.Q. and 2 Sections No. 2 Armoured Car Company.           No. 14 (Bomber) Squadron.     (b)  Ma&apos;an            1 Section No. 2 Armoured Car Company.           1 Company (Mounted) Trans-Jordan Frontier Force.     (c)  Kerka            H.Q. and Training Depot, Trans-Jordan Frontier Force.           2 Mounted Companies Trans-Jordan Frontier Force.           1 Camel Company, Trans-Jordan Frontier Force.     (d)  Ramleh            Base Details of No. 2 Armoured Car Company.     (e)  Sarafand            Palestine General Hospital.           No. 1 Wireless Company,  Royal Corps of Signals.     The total personnel  of the Royal Air Force and Armoured  Car Company in Palestine and Trans-Jordan numbered 29 officers and 354 other ranks.     The establishment of the  Trans-Jordan Frontier Force included 23  British officers and warrant officers and 653 local officers and other ranks and 50 reservists.     No.  2 Wireless Company consisted of 5 officers and 64 other ranks.  Of the latter only 12 men could immediately be made available for combatant duty.     The Palestine Police consisted of the British Section, with an establishment of 5 British officers and 170 other ranks, and the Palestinian Section with an establish- ment of 42 British officers, 73 Palestinian officers and 1,261 Palestinian other ranks.     The Arab legion (Trans-Jordan Police) consisted of a British  officer, 33 local officers and 786 other ranks.     94.  Apart  from locally recruited forces and the personnel of the Air Force and Armoured  Car Sections who are confined to their technical duties, there were thus available to  deal with  outbreaks  in  the  towns  and   populous centres  on the 23rd August, 1929, only 47 British officers and warrant officers and  182 British other ranks.     95.  Recent events have shown that the optimistic views held as to the improve- ment of the relations between the Arabs and the Jews were ill-founded, and that the public  security  forces maintained  in Palestine  were  insufficient  to prevent or suppress outbreaks of violence in time of tension between the two  sections of the population.  It also  became apparent that the  Palestinian members of the Police Force cannot be  relied upon to do their  duty in situations in which they are called upon to act against members of their own race and  religion.     There  is the further  consideration that the recent manifestations of the latent hatred felt by the Arabs for the Zionist Jews have been followed by a wave of Afftfe nationalist sentiment, which has spread  over Palestine and the  neighbouring AraD countries and has  engendered among  the Arabs  a feeling of  distrust  of the Mandatory Power.  Any recrudescence of the outbreaks in Palestine is, therefore, likely to  be supported by incursions of Arabs from the neighbouring  countries.    96.  In determining the future establishment and  composition of the  public security forces in Palestine, these considerations must be taken into account, and it must be remembered that, even if, as the result of the Report of the Commission of Inquiry,  it should be decided to make substantial changes in the political status of Palestine in order to meet the demands of the Arabs for a share in the Governmentof the  country, a considerable time  must elapse before the acute tension that nowekists between the Arab and Jewish sections of the population will be relaxed. -   In these circumstances I am of opinion that the establishment of the. public security  forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan should be increased  and that these forces should include a substantial proportion of British personnel on whom alone theGovernment can  place implicit reliance in times of inter-racial disturbances.,
     97.  In other despatches I have submitted to Your Lordship proposals for the increase of the Trans-Jordan Front:&apos;&apos;er Force and for the reorganisation of the Palestine Police, which  include recommendations for an increase of the establish- ment of the British Section of the Force.  On the assumption that the Police  Force has been reorganised  and that the proposed increase of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force has been effected, I submit the following observations as regards the Imperial Forces required to support the police  and other  local forces in time of  emergency.     The experiences of the recent outbreaks have made it clear that life and property in Palestine cannot be effectively protected by the local forces supported by the air arm alone, even in the case of internal disorders.     Aeroplanes and armoured cars are able effectively to deal with raids by Beduin in the open and sparsely  populated regions  of  eastern  Trans-Jordan.  But they cannot adequately provide  for the defence of Palestine.  They are unable to under- take many of the military operations that are  necessary for the defence and for the maintenance of order  in a country such as Palestine, which contains large towns and populous districts often enclosed and wooded and of which a large area consists of mountainous and broken country.     They are unable  to break up riotous  assemblies  in  towns with narrow and tortuous streets, inhabited by a mixed population, or to protect agricultural colonies from attack by day or by night.  They  are unable to surround and search villages or to round up roving bands  of marauders.   They  cannot effectively make  reconnais- sances in broken  or wooded  country.  To carry out all these operations effectively there is no substitute  for infantry,  preferably made mobile by being provided with adequate motor transport.    Further, owing to the nature of the soil and the absence of properly constructed aerodromes, air-craft  in Palestine are  practically immobile during and after  heavy rains.  Finally, in Palestine, punitive action from  the air is as a rule to be deprecated by dictates of humanity and policy alike.  For the indiscriminate destruction of life and  property, which  are almost inseparable from  air action under the  conditions prevailing  in Palestine, make it  desirable to avoid having recourse to such actionexcept as a last resort.    98.  In this connection, I would observe that  the views expressed by Sir Herbert Samuel in  paragraphs 1-4 of his Secret Despatch of the  19th April, 1925, on thescheme for the defence of Palestine show so just an appreciation of the situation asit then was, and are so applicable to the conditions  of to-day, that I  venture here to quote them:         &quot; The  scheme for  the defence of Palestine which has now  been submitted    has the great advantage that it draws a clear  line between the  military forces    and the police, and gives to the Air Officer Commanding and to the  Inspector-    General of Police full control of their several  units. But I am bound to say that    it involves considerable risks.  The British Gendarmerie will disappear, 200 of    its men being embodied in the Police.  The cavalry regiment is to be  removed in    the year after next.  The security of the country will then depend entirely upon    two flights  of  aeroplanes,  four  armoured cars,  and a  battalion  of 900    Palestinians.        &quot; 2. If we could be certain that the condition of the country would remain    as it is now, and as it has been during the last two years, such a  force would, in    my opinion, be sufficient. But we cannot be certain.   We must envisage as a    possibility a change in the political situation,  which might result in a recurrence    of the  conditions  of the spring of  1921.  If,  at that date, there  had not been a    considerable body of troops in the country, the serious riots which broke out in    Jaffa and the districts would almost certainly  have spread to other towns and    other districts. If in the future there were simultaneous disturbances in several    places, lasting (as in May 1921) for  several  days, and if the unrest here Avas    accompanied  (as in April 1920) by raids on a considerable scale from Trans-    Jordan, I do not think that the forces proposed would be able to cope with the    situation.        &quot;3.  There is also to be  considered the  psychological effect  of the removal    from the country  of all white units of infantry, cavalry or gendarmerie.   The    more extreme elements among the Arabs might thereby be encouraged to  insist    upon a change in the present policy of opposition limited to constitutional  lines,    in which they now concur with reluctance.  It would certainly make the Jewish    population apprehensive, and might lead to a renewal of the secret importation
     of arms and the formation of secret defence forces, which occurred after the     serious loss of life and  property suffered through the Arab attacks  in 1920     and 1921.         &quot;4.  It must  be  remembered  that aeroplanes are not  by  themselves  an     effective weapon with which to meet conditions such as I have  described in a     small country like Palestine.  Armoured cars also, while of  the greatest value     in the open or in  main streets,  are, of course, of little use  in places like the     Old City of Jerusalem and the Arab quarters of Jaffa, the places where, in fact,     the previous riots  took place. Nor would a  British cavalry regiment, even if     retained, be the best kind of force for Palestine, although its presence would in     itself have a certain moral effect.&quot;     99.  In addition to maintaining the present establishment of the Air Force and Armoured Cars now in Palestine and Trans-Jordan, I consider that  the permanent Garrison of Palestine should include not less than  two battalions of British infantry with the necessary ancillary services.     100.   When the permanent garrison has been  so strengthened I recommend that the  defence of  Palestine should cease to be a responsibility of the  Air Ministry, and should be transferred to the charge of the War Office.     During the recent  disturbances by far the greater part of the work of restoring order fell upon.the military forces, and it is logical that the ultimate responsibility for the defence of the country should rest with the Department mainly concerned.     If responsibility for the  defence of Palestine is transferred  to the War Office I  recommend  that, for defence purposes,  Palestine  should  be  made  part of the Egyptian Military Command.     That  arrangement would   be  not only  economically  and administratively convenient, but it would also be strategically advantageous,  for it  would greatly facilitate the reinforcement of the troops in Palestine in time of need.     10.1.   I am aware that objections have been raised to the stationing of battalions of British Infantry in Palestine on account of the expense; but,  in  view of the international  obligations undertaken by  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  under  the Mandate  and of  the world-wide criticisms to which the  Mandatory Power and the Government of Palestine have been exposed by the recent outbreaks,  I regard it as essential that no avoidable risks should be  incurred  of a  repetition of the disorders;  and I submit that financial considerations should not be allowed to stand in the way of the discharge by the Mandatory Power of its primary duty of providing the  Government  of Palestine  with sufficient  force to enable  it to  insure  the maintenance of  order and the safety of life and property.     102.   There is another consideration that cannot be altogether ignored in  fixing the establishment of the public security forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan : that is  the  interests  of the Mandatory for Syria.     In spite of the sympathy and assistance that the French Authorities in  Syriahave extended to the Government of Palestine during the recent outbreaks, they havecriticised  adversely the arrangements made for the defence of this country.   AndI understand,  from information that has reached  us, that, if the British Forces  inPalestine  are reduced to such  a point as, in their opinion, to endanger the peace of Syria, the French Government will probably make representations to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on the subject.     In this connection  I may mention that  when  a battalion was withdrawn from palestine  at the end of October  the General  Officer Commanding the DamascusDistrict made protests on the subject to the British Liaison Officer in Syria.  when was informed of these protests I authorised  the  British Liaison  Officer,  inaccordance with the authority which  you gave  me in your telegram No. 237 of the21st  October, to assure  the French Authorities  that in case of need the garrison  ofPalestine  would be reinforced at short notice by a battalion  from Malta.                          SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.     103.  The   following  are   the   main  conclusions  which  1  submit forconsideration :      (9) That the permanent garrison of Palestine should include  two battalions of          British Infantry with the necessary ancillary services (paragraph 99).
(10)  That responsibility for public  security in  Palestine should be transferred       from the Air Ministry to the War Office (paragraph 100).(11)  That, for defence purposes, Palestine should be made part of the Egyptian       Military Command (paragraph 100).                               ENCLOSURE No. 5.      Enclosure II to Confidential Despatch to the Secretary of  State, dated                              January 17, 1930.*Memorandum enumerating the Decisions taken in regard to the  Establishments of     the Police and Defence Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan since 1925 and     on the Defence A rrangements generally.     ON the 16th April, 1925,  a conference was held in Jerusalem, at which werepresent Mr. Amery, Secretary of State for the Colonies, Sir Samuel Hoare, Secretaryof State for Air, and Sir Herbert Samuel, High Commissioner for Palestine.     This  Conference decided  that  the  reorganisation of public  security forces inPalestine  and Trans-Jordan should be undertaken in accordance with the following principles:       (i)  A complete separation  between the  police forces  and the local military           forces;     (ii)  Palestine and Trans-Jordan to be more self-dependent  in regard to local           defence;     (iii)  A reduction to be made in the amount of the Grant-in-Aid hitherto made           by the British Treasury on this account.     2.  At the   date  of  this  Conference the  Civil  Forces  of Palestine  and transjordan-Jordan were as follows :         (a) The Palestine Police Force;        (b) The Palestine Gendarmerie;        (c) The British Gendarmerie;        (d) The Arab Legion.     (a) The establishment of the Police was 73 Officers  and 966  Other Ranks, thelatter being all Palestinians.  They were distributed throughout Palestine on normalPolice duty, i.e., the prevention, detection and prosecution of crime.     (b) The  strength of  the Palestine Gendarmerie, a semi-military force,  was approximately 500.  They were distributed as follows : HeadquarterstrooptrooptrooptroopstrooptrooptroopSarafand.Jericho.Tulkarem.Metullah.Beersheba.Roshpina.Beisan.Samakh.    One troop consisted  of 1  British  Officer,  1  British Warrant  Officer,  and approximately 50 Other Ranks.    The duty of the Palestine Gendarmerie was mainly frontier control and the pre-vention of armed raids into Palestine.  They also assisted the police in dealing withgangs of highway robbers and carried out police  duties in specified areas.    (c) The strength of the British Gendarmerie  was approximately 450.  Theywere distributed as follows :  Headquarters and 2 Companies1 Company ...1 Company ...1 Company ...1 Officer and 17 Other Ranks ...Sarafand.Nazareth.Jerusalem.Nablus.Haifa.Reproduced as Enclosure No. 4 of this document.
     One Company consisted of 4 Officers and approximately 80 Other Ranks.  From 1922-24 the British Gendarmerie comprised a Mounted Company as well.     The Force was trained on a semi-military basis and acted as an armed reserve to the Police, and co-operated in the extirpation of brigands.  They carried out motor- car patrols on the main roads; they were employed on escort duties and guards.  In certain emergencies detachments were temporarily stationed  in  Trans-Jordan.     (d) The Arab Legion, stationed in Trans-Jordan, had an establishment of 1,033 of all ranks, and the Police and Prisons Staff of 72.     By the end of 1925 the numbers had been increased to 1,253 and 219 respectively, principally on account of the taking over of the Ma&apos;an Vilayet by the Trans-Jordan Government.     3.  Besides the Civil Forces described above,  the following military forces were stationed in Palestine and Trans-Jordan :          1 Regiment of Cavalry,         1 Squadron of aeroplanes.         1 Company of Armoured Cars (R.A.F.),         1 Wireless Company (R.C. of Signals),         Palestine General Hospital, together with  ancillary  services.     4.  No written record of the Jerusalem Conference of the 16th April, 1925, appears to exist, but the general lines of the scheme of reorganisation approved were stated in a letter from the Air Ministry to  the Colonial Office, dated the 19th May, 1925, and were  communicated to the  High Commissioner of  Palestine in Colonial Office despatch Secret 16/7/25 (11/705/S/26)  as  follows:-     (a) The British Gendarmerie  to be reduced to 200 and to be absorbed in  the           Police Force under the  Acting Inspector-General of Police;     (b) The total strength of the Police to be raised to 1,500;     (c) The Palestine Gendarmerie to become the Local Military Force at a strength          of  500  in  the  first  instance,  to  be taken  over  by  the  Air  Officer          Commanding;     (d) The Cavalry Regiment to be withdrawn;     (e) Remaining units to remain unchanged.     5.  Sir Herbert Samuel thought that the scheme proposed at the Conference ofthe 16th April, 1925,  involved considerable risks  to the safety of the country, andin a Secret despatch to the Secretary of  State, dated the  19th April,  1925, he expressed his views on the situation.     In that despatch Sir Herbert Samuel dwelt especially on the limitations of air-craft and armoured cars in a country such as Palestine, and suggested that a small british Military Force, preferably two companies of Infantry, should again be stationed  in Palestine on the withdrawal of the cavalry regiment.     That suggestion, however, was definitely rejected by  the Air Ministry in their letter of the 19th Mav,  1926, enclosed with Mr. Amery&apos;s Secret despatch  of  the 16th July, 1925.     6.  In  his telegram No.  198  of  the  3rd July,  1925,  the Secretary  of Stateinformed  the  Palestine Government that no official  decision regarding  the exactmeasures  to be  adopted in  connexion with the reorganisation of the  Palestine Gendarmerie would be  reached until  Lord Plumer had examined the question onthe spot.     Sir Herbert  Samuel left  Palestine on  the  30th  June, 1925, and  Lord Plumerarrived on the 25th August, 1925.     7.  After  studying the  problem Lord Plumer made his  proposals  in  his Confidential despatches  of the 30th October, 1925, and the 4th February, 1926.     He proposed the disbandment of  the  British Gendarmerie and  the Palestine Gendarmerie,  and the reconstitution of the  Arab Legion as the Trans-Jordan Police Force.  He  also recommended the  raising of an Imperial mounted regiment, to be recruited locally, as a military force to be paid for by His Majesty&apos;s Government. This force was raised and was called the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force.
Under Lord Plumer&apos;s organisation the local forces therefore consisted of :  (a)  Palestine Police.(b)  Trans-Jordan Frontier Force.(c)  Trans-Jordan Police (afterwards renamed the Arab Legion).8.   The details of Lord Plumer&apos;s proposals as set out were : (a)  Palestine Police to be reinforced by 5 Officers and 212 Other Ranks from      the British Gendarmerie  and by  237  mounted policemen from the      Palestine Gendarmerie; and by a  Training School.(b)  Trans-Jordan  Frontier   Force  to  be   recruited  from   the Palestine      Gendarmerie and the Arab Legion and to consist of the following: Amman     Headquarters      ...       ...      ...      ...        36  &apos;  2 Companies Mounted Rifles        ...      ...       306    2 Troops Hotchkiss Guns   ...      ...      ...        75Ma&apos;an     1 Camel Company  ...       ...      ...      ...       153Sarafand     1 Company Mounted Rifles  ...      ...      ...       163                                 Total ...      ...       723     (c) Trans-Jordan Police (afterwards renamed the Arab Legion) to be gradually           reduced, by the completion of contracts and  recruitment to the Trans-           Jordan Frontier Force, from its existing establishment of 1,400 to a force           of 650, not costing more than  70,000.  The  Trans-Jordan Authorities,           however, doubted the expediency of reducing  the Civil Police below 930           at an approximate cost of  90,000 a year.     9.  In his Confidential despatch of the  30th October, 1925, Lord Plumer also expressed the opinion that the then existing establishment of Royal Air Force inPalestine and Trans-Jordan was inadequate and should be increased by two flights.     The Air Ministry objected to this on financial, strategic and political  grounds(vide Secret  telegram  from  Sir  Hugh Trenchard  to  Lord  Plumer of 20/11/25.&quot;The financial question at home is  at present supreme.&quot;   Vide also  Colonial OfficeDespatch, Confidential A, of 14/1/26).     In view of these representations Lord Plumer waived  his request for an  increaseof the Air Force on the  understanding that the flight of Bristol Fighters then inPalestine should be replaced by D.H.Q.A.S.     10.  Lord Plumer&apos;s proposals for the reorganisation of Public  Security  forcesio. Paifisii-aa as set out above were generally approved by the Secretary  of State inhis telegram No. 9 of the 18th January, 1926.     Correspondence followed mainly on the question as to whether the Imperial orthe Palestine Government should bear the cost of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Forceand the grant-in-aid to Trans-Jordan; and also on questions of detail regarding the.organisation.    11.   In February 1926 the Cavalry Regiment (IX Lancers) left Palestine withthe concurrence of Lord Plumer. In the course of 1926 the British Gendarmerie weredisbanded, the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force  was created and the Palestine Policewere strengthened.    12.   The distribution of the  reorganised military  forces proposed by the air officer Commanding and concurred in by Lord Plumer (Confidential despatch of the5th February, 1926) was-    Amman         1 Company Mounted Rifles, T.J.F.F.      -  2 Sections Machine Guns, T.J.F.F.    Ma&apos;an         1 Company Cavalry, T.J.F.F.
     Sarafand          Headquarters, T.J.F.F.         2 Companies Mounted Rifles, T.J.F.F.     Amman          2 Flights Aeroplanes, R.A.F.         1 Section Armoured Cars, R. A.F.     Ramleh -         1 Flight Aeroplanes, RA.F.  .         2 Sections Armoured Cars, RA.F.     Sarafand          Command Headquarters, R.A.F.         Depot for Transport Repair and Supplies, RA.F.         Hospital, RA.F.     Before the  end of 1926, however, Lord Plumer ordered that the whole of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force should be stationed in Trans-Jordan.     The final distribution of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force was :      Zerqa : Headquarters and 3 Companies.     Ma&apos;an :  1 Company     13.  At the end of 1926, after the reorganisation,  the establishment of the Forces was:          (a) Palestine Police                British Officers      ...       ...      ...      ...       50               British Other Ranks        ...      ...      ...      200               Palestinian Officers  ...       ...      ...      ...       75               Palestinian Other Ranks     ...      ...      ...     1,300         (b) Trans-Jordan Frontier Forces                British Officers  and Warrant Officers ...      ...       31               Native Officers and Other  Ranks      ...      ...      756         (c) Arab Legion                British Officers  and Warrant Officers ...      ...        4               Native Officers and Other  Ranks      ...      ...      833         (d) Royal Air Force                1 Squadron of aeroplanes.               1 Company of Armoured Cars.               Palestine General Hospital and ancillary services.         (e) Royal Corps of Signals                1 Wireless Company.     14.  The strength of the Palestine Police has remained fairly  constant.   Thetotal establishment of Palestine Other Ranks remained from the end of 1917 to the23rd August, 1929, at about 1,300;  in addition, the establishment of British other ranks was 170 on the 23rd August.     The total number of British Officers  remained 50, of whom 3 were attached tothe British Section and 5 to the Prison Service.     In 1928 the cost of the Palestine Police was  P. 363,656, all of which was borneby Palestine funds.     15.  There have been three successive annual reductions of the Trans-JordanFrontier Force by 50 troopers,  so that the establishment of  the Force was reduced from 750 at the end of 1926 to a  little over 600 on the 23rd August, 1928.     It was Lord Plumer&apos;s intention that the Force should be reduced progressivelyat the rate of 50 per annum  until a strength of 500 was reached.   This was to beeffected ,by not replacing casualties  amongst the troopers.  No reduction was to bemade in the  number of  officers and non-commissioned officers, except as regardsBritish Warrant Officers who should fall out as their contracts expired.     Lord Plumer intended that the cadres of officers and non-conjmissioned officers should continue in existence,  in order that the Force might quickly  be expanded to1,000 men should the necessity arise.  With this object in view, part passu with thereduction, a Reserve was to be  formed.   The strength of this Reserve was&apos;fixed at
first at 150,  and in July 1929  50 men  were enrolled.  In  1928  the  cost of  the trans-Jordan Frontier  Force was  P. 151,909,  of which one-sixth was borne byBritish funds.  Palestine contributed  P. 31,000 to the cost  of the military forcesof the Mandatory in Palestine and Trans-Jordan.    16.  The strength of the Arab Legion has remained the same; the Gendarmeriesection has been reduced by 20, and the Police and Prisons staff strengthened.    In 1928 the cost of the Arab Legion, which was entirely borne by Trans-Jordan,was  P. 98,662.    17.  The establishment  of the Royal Air  Force remained unchanged up to the23rd August, 1929.    18.  The defence arrangements generally were as follows :       (i) The Commandant  of Police worked  out the numbers and provenance of          police reinforcements in certain  defined emergencies and local  defence          schemes  were drawn  up for the more important centres in  conjunction          with the Officer Commanding the Royal Air Force.     (ii) The Officer Commanding  Trans-Jordan Frontier Force worked cut similar          schemes for that Force.    (iii) As there were no troops  in  Palestine,  Lord Plumer inquired of the Air          Ministry whence he would be able to obtain reinforcements in  case of          emergency.   The reply was that in  case of emergency, the Cabinet would          decide that point, but  that probably  reinforcements w^ould come from          Egypt in the first place.    19.  It will thus be seen that  the outstanding difference between the organisa-tion and disposition of the public security forces before and after the reorganisationdecided upon by the Colonial Office and the Air Ministry in 1925 were as follows :     20.  At the beginning of August 1925  there was considerable semi-military support for the Police by the presence of detachments (each  composed  of 4 officersand 80 men) of British Gendarmerie at the principal strategic centres of Palestine;and by  the presence of  detachments (each composed of  1  British officer,  1  Britishwarrant officer and  50 Palestinians) of the Palestine Gendarmerie  at the principalstrategic points on uhe frontier between Palestine and Trans-Jordan.    The responsibilities of the Palestine Police were also diminished by the fact thatthe  Palestine Gendarmerie did all the Police work in the frontier zone.    21.  At  the  beginning  of August  1929  on  the  other hand, there  was no support for the Police  in Palestine in the shape  of organised military or  semi-military land forces.  The police numbered about 1,300 as against 1,000 in 1928, butthey were all engaged at the  same time, so that no reserve of force was available.  Itwas, therefore, impossible to send reinforcements to places where disturbances aroseor were threatened.    22.  The only semi-military units actually present and available  in Palestinewhich could act as a reserve in support of the Palestinian Section of the Police werethe  British Section of the Palestine Police, the effective strength of which in August1929 was only 140, and the Special  Constables, numbering  about 170,  who werespecially enlisted after the disturbances had broken out.

I HAVE the honour to forward for your Lordship&apos;s information a  copy of aletter sent to the Air Ministry by the Air Officer Commanding, Palestine and  Trans-Jordan, outlining  the proposed distribution of  the Military and Air  Forces  toprovide for the internal security of Palestine.
    2.   The proposals set out in the letter were framed after consultation and  inagreement with my advisers and myself.    3.   The arrangements for the close defence of the Jewish colonies in the intervalthat must elapse before the troops take up their precautionary period stations are shown in my Secret despatch of the 29th March.                             I have, &amp;c.                      (Sgd.)      J. E. CHANCELLOR,                                         High Commissioner for  Palestine.Annexure to Enclosure No. 6.Letter from Air Officer Commanding Palestine and Trans-Jordan to Air Ministry.(Reference TJP/44/22/Air.l.)             Headquarters, Royal Air Force,                                              Palestine and Trans-Jordan,Sir,                                               Jerusalem, March 27, 1930.    INTERNAL security:  Palestine.    I have the  honour to inform you that as the result of conferences between thevarious  authorities concerned, it has been agreed that the measures to be taken toensure the internal security of Palestine should conform to the following  broad principles :     2.  The Police will ultimately assume responsibility for the close protection ofthe Jewish settlements.    3.  Until the reorganisation of the Police has progressed sufficiently to enablethem  to undertake such close protection, and during any subsequent precautionaryperiod,  the Army dispositions will ensure that detachments of Army  Troops arereadily  available to render prompt assistance to the Jewish settlements if required.    4.  Pending a decision as to the size of the permanent Army Garrison, it is assumed that two infantry battalions will remain in Palestine.    5.  On  this  assumption,   Army  Troops  will  be stationed  during  the precautionary period as follows : Northern Area.Headquarters  Wing t: A &quot;  Bn.Machine Gun  Company ...Rifle Company ...Rifle Company ...Rifle Company ...\  Beit Galim Camp.   Mount Carmei   Nazareth.   Boshpjna.Southern Area.Headquarters Wing &apos;: B &quot; Bn.Machine Gun Company ...Rifle Company  ...Rifle Company  ...Rifle Company  ...^j-  Talpioth Camp.   Tel Aviv.   Beit Vegan (G.H.Q. Reserve). f&quot; \ Nablus.\ I Hebron.    6.   When permission is given to resume peace time routine, it is considered thegarrison should be stationed as follows :     Northern Area         At Haifa :  1 Battalion.    Southern Area -        At Jerusalem :  1 Battalion less 1 Company.        At Jaffa :  1 Company.
    7.  Officer  Commanding,  British Troops  in  Palestine, did  not consider  itnecessary to have one Company permanently at Jaffa, which can normally be reached by road transport  from Jerusalem in 1^ hours.  As a result of past experience ofthe rapidity with  which trouble breaks out  in  Jaffa-Tel Aviv area,  and thepossibility of interruption of road communication, the Police Authorities stronglyrepresented that a  Military detachment should always remain in Jaffa, otherwise itwould mean a very considerable increase of Police in Jaffa, who would not be requiredin times of peace.  I consider that this detachment is necessary, and His excellency the High Commissioner has agreed that Jaffa should have a  permanent garrison ofone Company.    8.  The Trans-Jordan Frontier Force will, under present arrangements, main-tain one half company (mounted) at each of the following :             Roshpina.             Semakh.             Beisan.            Jisr Mejamie (Trans-Jordan).    9.  It is realised that this means splitting up the two Companies, which is not altogether satisfactory, but it is considered that,  with the  present situation, thisdistribution is necessary.  The original  intention  was to  have a full Company atBeisan, and another at  Semakh.   Owing to the importance of the Palestine ElectricalCompany&apos;s installations at Jisr Mejamie, it was decided that it was necessary tohave  an adequate  military garrison at Jisr Mejamie,  which  is in Trans-Jordan.Subsequently, the  situation in  the  North demonstrated  the  necessity of havingmounted troops immediately available in that area to act in support of the Police, asthe country is, in parts, unsuitable for motor transport, and safe and the nearestJewish  colonies  in that area  are approximately 60  kilometres from railhead  atSemakh.    10.   During the precautionary  period,  the Sections  of No. 2 Armoured CarCompany in Palestine will be stationed as follows :              Haifa: 1 Section.             Roshpina: 1 Section.             Ramleh :  1 Section.Their proposed location in peace time is :              Haifa: 1 Section.             Ramleh :  2 Sections.    11.   One  Royal Air Force Squadron  will  remain at  Ramleh during  the precautionary period.  Its location under peace  time conditions will presumably bedecided by the Air Ministry at a later date.                                       I have, &amp;c.

Chief  Secretary,  Palestine    Government, Jerusalem.                              ENCLOSURE NO. 7.                Letter from the War Office to the Colonial Office.0176/317 (M.O.2.).                                War Office, London,Sir,                                                       February 20, 1930.    I AM  commanded by the  Army Council  to refer to your letter No. 77023/30,,dated the 7th February, 1930,  covering a despatch from Sir John Chancellor, datedthe 3rd January, 1930, and a letter from the Air Ministry No. S. 29002/Pt. II/S. 6,dated the 31st January, 1930.    2.  The Council note that Sir John  Chancellor envisages the possibility of thesituation in Palestine deteriorating to such an extent as  to  make it necessary for
him to call for military reinforcements  amounting  to  2 infantry battalions and1 cavalry regiment.  In this connexion it  is observed that Lord Passfield enquires      (a) how these reinforcements can be made available with the least possible delay;     (6) whence these reinforcements would be obtained;     (c) how long it would take the reinforcements to reach Palestine; and     (d) whether it is proposed to earmark units for this purpose.     3.  In  reply,  the Council first wish to make it quite clear that the question of sending  military  reinforcements  to Palestine  is closely connected with  that  ofmaintaining an adequate garrison in Egypt.  The experiences of August 1929 showthat, in emergency, it may be necessary to call on the garrison of  Egypt to providethese reinforcements.  As  the garrison of Egypt  has been calculated solely with  aview to meeting certain clearly defined liabilities in that country, it is fortunatethat the situation  there in  August last year admitted of  the temporary depletion ofthe British  garrison caused by the sudden call for military assistance in Palestine.It is, perhaps, even more fortunate  that the disorders in Palestine, arising as theydid out of communal and religious causes, did not produce repercussions in Egypt,and this possibility is one which the Council cannot afford to ignore should they beasked again to deplete the British  garrison in Egypt in order to reinforce the troopsin Palestine.     4.  Bearing the above possibilities in mind, the Army Council desire  to replyto the questions tabulated in paragraph 2  above  as follows :      (a) In the event  of grave emergency  arising in Palestine, and on  the under-          standing that the situation in Egypt permitted, the reinforcements would          be  sent from Egypt.  This would be the most  rapid method of producing          the reinforcements.     (6) If the necessity for  extra  military help can be  foreseen, normally one          battalion would be sent from Malta  and another from Gibraltar.  The          cavalry regiment  would  be sent  from Egypt if the situation  in  that          country permitted.     (c) Troops sent from Egypt can begin to arrive in Palestine in 24 hours. Those          from Malta cannot arrive for at least 48 hours,  even if the Royal Navy          can provide  the necessary sea  transport;  troops from Gibraltar would          take double this time subject to the same condition as regards transport.          It  must, however,  be pointed out that these  timings are conditional on          the Admiralty being agreeable to making H.M.  Ships  available for this          purpose.  Should H.M. Ships  not be available, the  Army Council could          not give any useful estimate of the time in which merchant ships could          effect the necessary transfer of troops;  but  this method  of  transport          would be very much slower, owing to the necessity for taking up shipping          which would  not necessarily be available in the Mediterranean.     (d) It is not proposed to earmark any particular units for this purpose, though,          if the High Commissioner were apprehensive  of trouble being imminent,          troops could be warned by telegram to stand by.     5.  In conclusion, the Army Council  feel that the system under which they are asked to undertake to provide military reinforcements for quelling disturbances ina country for whose security they bear no responsibility is not one which lends itselfto smooth working in practice.  Whilst they are,  of course, ready to co-operate inevery way they can to assist the High Commissioner in his difficulties, they considerthat, in &quot;the event  of reinforcements being asked for, the control  of the operationsmust be  vested in the  hands of  a  military commander under the orders of  theWar Office.  In advancing this claim the  Council  wish to refer to the recommenda-tion of  the  Chiefs  of  the  Staff Committee  at  their  26th  Meeting  on  the11th December, 1925, when it was agreed that  &quot;when the operations of a british force became dependent primarily on land forces, the command should rest with  amilitary officer.&apos;&apos;     6.  A c-opy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office, the Admiralty andtq t&amp;e Air Ministry                                                         I am,  &amp;c.                                              (Signed)      H. J. CREEDY.
