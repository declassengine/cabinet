Joint Memorandum by Secretary of State for Scotland,                   and Minister of Stealth.           VIo propose to embody the following arrangements ia the  necessary draft Order is Couaoil under the Census Aot, 1920,  of which a proof is annexed.                         Census Date.           We propose that the Census Day shall be 26th April, 1931.                       Census Inquiries.           Generally,  it has appeared necessary to restrict the  1931 programme to some extent as compared with that for 1921, which  was exceptionally fall9  in view of the events of the preceding  decennium,   A further census will be due ia 1936;  end the work  of tabulation will be specially complicated oa the preseat  occasion by ohaages ia local areas effected, under the reoent  Local Government Aots.           In addition to  the staple inquiries as to Name,  sex,  Age^ and Marital Condition,  the following inquiries are  proposed to be inohided  both ia England and Vales and ia Scotland0  Birthplaoe and Nationality.  The repetition of this long-  standing inquiry is  urged by the Home Office.   It is proposed to  elaborate it slightly ia the Scottish returns for purely bcottish  purposes by asking the length of residenoe In Soot land in the case  o:f  persons  born elsewhere.  Occupation and Industry.    These important inquiries,  whioh were  first  established upon a thorough basis in 1921,  are  proposed to  be  repeated with equal or greater  completeness.  Housiin^JL   The particulars  obtained in  1921  will again be  included.
                                                            9 K 9                                                            CJi (J w The nature  of the tabulations and statistics to be derived therefrom is receiving special consideration. Usual Residence.  A new inquiry is proposed on this subject for the following reasons.   The experience of many countries has led to  the establishment of a system of census enumeration &quot;de jure&quot; according to which the local distribution of the population  is governed by the usual residence of the individual rather than by the address at which he happened (de facto) to be present on the Census Day, as in this country.  In proportion as the population becomes more fluid the less reliable are the results to be obtained from the de facto system and the greater is the risk of distortion in the local census1 figures.   While it is not proposed to change over to the de jure basis ia the presentation of the 1931 results,  it is thought desirable that the information should be obtained on this occasion in order that the extent of any distortion or error may be definitely ascertained for the guidance of future policy.    further,  such information may be expected to be  of considerable value in the estimation of local populations as the basis of the distribution of  exchequer grants to local authorities under the local- Government Acts.            In addition to the foregoing Inquiries which will be  common to all parts of Great  Britain,  the following inquiries have been adopted for inclusion in the Welsh or  Scottish returns alone as serving some special  purpose not applicable to Great Britain as a whole.           The usual inquiry as to Welsh speaking will be included in the Welsh returns and  as to Gaelic  speaking ia theScottish returns.           The Soottish 1921 inquiry as to whether entitled oo Medical  Benefit under the national  Health Insurance-Acts isproposed to  be repeated in the  Scottish returns.
                                                              J si i)           This programme does not Include any express inquiry on Unemployment,   The ordinary census machinery, reproducing, as it does,  conditions prevailing at a partioular point of time only; is unsuited to investigate this subject;  and any special  inquiry would invdlvd the use of a separate supplementary schedule.    This procedure is adopted in the U.S.A., where in the absence  of a system of unemployment insurance the census represents the only source of information on the subject,,   The substantial  cost and administrative complications entailed by the introduction of such procedure into this country would not necessarily  preclude its adoption if results of commensurate value were obtainable.   We understand, however,  that the Minister of Labour, after full consideration of this proposition,  has decided for  the following reasons not to recommend it.   As regards the great bulk of the unemployed who are within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts such an inquiry could add nothing useful to the information already available.   AS regards the residue, no uniform or consistent interpretation of &quot;Unemployment&quot; could be ensured in the statements obtained, and the results,  -whether for the purpose of measuring the full extent ofunemployment or for the purpose of considering the extension of insurance to industries at present excluded,  (e.gc agriculture),would ba, unreliable and even misleading,   *further,  the statistics could not  at the  best become available until longafter the date to which they related.    We  see no reason  todissent from the Minister1s  decision,                                  (Initialled)  W.A.                                        &quot;      A.G.3rd September,  1930.Ministry of Health.
