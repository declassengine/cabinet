A few unconnected proofs of the Reportof the Permanent Mandates Commission have been received,which contain numerous animadversions on the MandatoryPower.          The necessary &quot;Observations&quot; by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to be appended to the Report have been drafted in consultation with Sir J,Chancellor (HighCommissioner), and also Sir J. Campbell (EconomicAdviser to the Colonial Office) who is well acquainted with Palestine.          Time, has not permitted the printing of theReport itself, which is very lengthy; or of the draft&quot;Observations&quot;, but copies of the latter are circulatedto the Cabinet.   They are still under revision, butas they must be sent off this week, I have no alternative but to submit them in this form.29th July, 1930
DRAFT MEMOMDOM ,QN GF^ERAL REPORT OF: PIEMANMT      MANDATES GOIpOSSIQKThe General Report of the Permanent mandates commission to the Council of the League on the work ofthe 17th Extraordinary Session of the Commission dealingwith the events .&apos;.-which occurred in Palestine in August and september, 1929 is divided into three parts.  The firstcontains a commentary on the nature of the outbreak andon the attitude and conduct of the Mandatory Power during and before the outbreak (see pages 3 to 8).  The seconddeals with the steps taken by the Mandatory Power to restore and maintain order (see page 8).  The third dealswith future policy in Palestine (see pages 8 to 10.)Majesty&apos;s Government note with satisfaction that themeasures taken by them to restore and maintain order inPalestine last autumn appear to have met with the tacitapproval of the Mandates Commission and that, in theiropinion, the action which has subsequently  been takenseems to &quot;afford a guarantee that public order cannot 1   -again be seriously disturbed.&quot;  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare also glad to note that the Commission consider thatthe statement of their Accredited Representative regardingthe suspension of certain immigration permits should&quot;dipel  the fears which have been expressed in Jewishcircles as to the Mandatory Power&apos;s inclination to dis-charge  in full its obligation to encourage jewish immigration and to ensure the establishment  of the JewishNational Home  under the conditions stipulated in theMandate.&quot;As regards the second aoind third parts, Hisin
          In regard, to future policy His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have duly noted that the Mandates commission has no objection to raise to the views expressed by theAccredited Representative regarding the obligations laiddown by the Mandate in regard to the two sections of thepopulation of Palestine.  It is also noted that theCommission appear disposed to acquit His Majesty1 sGovernment of any charge of failure in its obligations or its immediate duties in regard to the establishment of aregime of self-government in Palestine;  that theCommission&apos;s conception of the immediate duty of theMandatory Power is in accord with that expressed by theAccredited Representative and that, generally speaking,the Mandatory Power&apos;s conceptions as regards future policyin Palestine are not called in question by the Commission.          In tiie first part of the Report,  however, it isobserved that numerous and, in some cases,  somewhat seriouscriticisms are levelled by the Permanent mandates commission against trie Mandatory Power in respect of its policy during the past quinquennium.  Perhaps the gravestcharge is that, contained in the view expressed in particularin paragraph 6 that the partial inaction of the MandatoryPower as regards its obligations to the Palestinian popula-tion both Arab and Jewish is the fundamental cause of thefriction which eventually culminated in the seriousdisorder of August 1929.  Particular emphasis is laid upon the alleged failure of His Majesty&apos;s Government topromote agricultural and educational development and a more extensive programme of public v/orks and to encourage co-operation between Jews and Arabs as a cause of dissatisfaction-tion on the part of the Arabs with the Mandatory regime.This criticism is the more surprising m view of thefact that since the acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentof the Palestine Mandate the coaments of the Permanent                                            Mandates
 Mandates Commission upon the British Admin i strati on based upon an examination of Annual Reports and of informa-tion supplied year after year by Accredited Representatives,cannot be said to have fore-shadowed in any way the chargesnow brought against the manner in which the Mandatory power has carried out its obligations.           In paragraph 4 of their report the permanent mandates ^-Commission state that the resentment which caused the Arabs to commit excesses was &quot;ultimately due to thepolitical disappointments which they attributed to the partieconcerned in the Mandate and primarily to the BritishGovernment.&quot;  Nevertheless,  in paragraph 6 it is argued thata more active policy oh the partt of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin promoting the interests of the Arabs in the social andeconomic spheres, and in bringing the two sections of thepopulation   Jewish and Arab - into close association, wouldhave blunted the edge of antagonism.  Such an argumentappears somewhat inconsistent with the passage quoted from paragraph 4.  It fails to take account of the paramount importance hitherto attached by the Arab leaders to thepolitical issue, and it ignores the fact that the demands ofthe Arabs have always been for a form of self-governmentwhich Y/ould be plainly inconsistent with the Mandate andthat the repealed offers of His Majesty&apos;s Government to -associate Arabs and Jews in some form of representative government which would be consistent with their mandataryobligations have always been rejected by the Arab leaders.The difficulties created for the Mandatory Power by this attitude on the part of the Arabs seem to be very littleappreciated by the Mandates Commission.           Moreover, His Majesty&apos;s Government desire toemphasise the fact that the obligation imposed on them bythe Mandate is of a comples: character, asis shown by the wordwording of Article 2 - &quot;The Mandatory shall be responsible                                                for
 for  placing  the country under  such political, administrative, end  economic  conditions as will  secure         the  establishment of &quot;the Jewisix National Home as         laid  down in the Preamble;         the development of self-governing institutions].         and for safeguarding the civil and religious rights         of all the inhabitants of Palestine,  irrespective         of race or religion.&quot;Nevertheless, on page 9 of their report the permanent mandates Commission refer to the &quot;immediate obligation&quot; of ^the Mandatory as being defined in the Mandate in thefollowing terms         &quot;(1)  Placing the country under such T... conditions            as will secure the establishment of the Jewish            National Home;&quot;         (2)&quot;(Placing the country under such conditions as              will secure) the development of self-governing              institutions.&quot;           It Is remarkable that no reference is made by trieMandates Commission in this connection to the importantqualification already quoted from Article 2 of the Mandate,namely,  that  the Mandatory shall also be responsible for safeguarding the civil and religious rights of all theinhabitants of Palestine,  irrespective of race andreligion.&quot;           This,  in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government,is the core of the problem.   Although the difficult nature oftheir task is elsewhere to some extent recognised,  the bearing  of this particular obligation upon the problem of devising measures which would admit of the increasingdevelopment of the two races side by  side is largelyignored.                                             His
          Hi s Majesty&apos;s Government note with surpad sothat trie findings of  Lhe Shaw commission on  -questionsof fact such as the causes and responsibility for theoutbreak have been largely ignored, or lightly  called inquestion.  Coming, as  they do, from so authoritative a source, and based as they are upon voluminous evidencetested by rigorous cross--examination the attitude towards them of the Mandates Conmission is the more strikingwhen contrasted with the fact that at the same  timecriticisms taken from  a Jewish memorandum (which reachedthe Mandatory Power too late for an accompanying commentto be made upon it) have been adopted^ and when it isfreely admitted by the Commission that account has beentaken of criticisms from various sources upon which alsono opportunity of comment could be open to the MandatoryPower.          Generally speaking charges of Arabs against Jemand of Jews against Arabs have been omitted from theReport as outside the  scope of the Mandates Commission,although they were discussed at length in the proceedings,and -this has necessarily led to the Mandatory Power-, being left as the only target for criticism.  Were it not forthe reputation cf the Permanent Mandates  Commission asa body whose judicial  fairness was beyond dispute itwould,  in the face of  these  facts., be difficult  not todraw the inference that the Commission when consideringits Report was divided in its opinion between those whosympathised with the Ara,fc claims and those whosesympathies were in favour of the Jews and that, as theonly way to secure unanimity,  &quot;the divergent sectionsunited in throwing the whole blame for the past unforturnate incidents upon the Mandatory Power.  The manner in                                                  which
which  some  opinions reflecting on the conduct of HisMajesty&apos;s Government have &quot;been adopted by the Commissionwhile  the considered judgments of the Shaw Commasuion,based  cn an exhaustive enquiry on the spot and uponevidence which had been  subjected to the most searchingcross-examination by eminent counsel, have been dismissedas untenable or have been ignored, suggests that undueweight hasten given to  ex-parte criticism of theMandatory which His Majesty&apos;s Government had insufficientopportunity of rebutting.  His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot but feel that protest is called for against the procedure of the Commission in drawing so much of their criticism from such sources.  Hi 3 Majesty&apos;s Government have with much regret felt bound to record these general impres-sions  of the Permanent Mandates Commissions report as they consider that the value of that document aspurporting - to give an impartial verdict on this difficult and contentious matter is gravely impairedby the features to which allusion has been made in thef oregoing paragraphs.          It is now proposed to comment, in some detail,on the criticisms contained in the Commission&apos;s  Report.In the fifth sub-paragraph,  on page 4, the permanent mandates Commission state that they disagree with thevie?/ of the Shaw Commission that there  was no premadita-tion on the part of the Arabs.  It is attempted to prove that there was premeditation by referring to variouspassages in the Shaw Commission&apos;s Report which seemedinconsistent with a contrary vie?/.  It should,  however,be pointed out that,  after taking into account the facts which  came to their notice (smch as the absence ofsimultaneous action in different parts and of interferencewith communications by the cutting of telegraphs,  blocking                                                         of
of roads, destruction of bridges and railway lines), itwas the considered opinion of the Shaw Commission who had much tested evidence before them that &quot;the outbreak wasnot premeditated.  Disturbances did not occur simul-taneously in all parts of Palestine  but spread from thecapital through a period of days to most outlying centres of population and to some rural districts&quot;.  This view hasbeen accepted by His Majesty1 s Government,  who cannot butfaal that, considering the exhaustive nature of theenquiry and the care with which evidence was collected andsifted by the Shaw Commission, and exhaustively dealtwith by distinguished leaders of the English bar incross examination, the grounds on which the Permanent.Mandates Commission see fit to differ from the conclusionarrived at, are scarcely adequate.  These grounds aresolely certain statements made by the Shaw Commissionthemselves, in a variety of contexts.  It is obvious thatall these points, cited as inconsistent with the conclusionarrived at, were necessarily taken into account by  thatCommission and their importance carefully appraised by them^before they arrived at the considered opinion which thePermanent Mandates Commission, without any further  evidence before them except ex-parte and untested statement, are disposed to call in question.  This point is mentioned asit has a bearing upon a later paragraph of the Report,reference to which will subsequently be made.          In the nest few  sentences the Mandates Commissionattempt to argue that the  Shaw Commission were wrong in holding that the outbreak was not an outbreak against british authority.  His Majesty&apos;s Government do not find any evidence that the outbreak was &quot;ultimately due  to                                       political
political disappointments&quot; of any legitimate kind;  and the sole evidence which the Permanent Mandates Commissionrefer to in. support of their view is clearly a strong protest by various Arab authorities against the fundamentalposition in Palestine, as fixed by the Mandate itself.  Thisprotest is not in any sense a protest against Britishauthority but is a protest against the Mandate and the Leagueof Nations, and British authority is only implicated asbeing the mechanism by which the Mandate is worked.  On thispoint the Permanent Mandates Commission has pronounced its opinion in the following words:-  &quot;To all the sections ofthe population which are rebelling against the Mandate,whether they object to it on principle or wish to retain only those of its provisions which favour their particular cause,the Mandatory Power must obviously return a definite andcategorical refusal,&quot;  Whatever may have been the attitudeof the  Arab leaders, the highly significant fact remains thatduring the disturbances no attack was made or attempted onthe local representatives of British authority.  Thi*s fact,which speaks for itself,  and which was directly brought totheir notice by the accredited Representative, is ignoredby the Permanent Mandates Commission.           In paragraph 5 of the Report certain conclusions are formulated, regarding the responsibility of the MandatoryPower and the Palestine Government for the immediate causes of the outbreak.  The first conclusion condemns theGovernment for not having defined the status quo in regardto the Wailing Wall before the disturbances.  It is possiblethat the detailed regulations,  such as were issued by thePalestine Government after the outbreak,  might have beenpromulgated at an earlier date with favourable effect.  It                                                  was
was however obviously the right course for the Governmentin matters of a religious nature (especially having regardto the doubtful juridical position created by the failure -for which His Majesty&apos;s Government con accept no re-sponsibility - to establish the Holy Places Commissionannounced in the Mandate itself) to try to arrive at a definition of the JS^S^ASLSM by agreement and not toimpose it.  That is exactly what the Palestine Governmentwere attempting to do before the outbreak.  The delay whichin fact  occurred was  due  to the failure of the partiesto the dispute to  comply  promptly with the request  thatthey  should  submit their  claims with,  the  evidence onwhich  they were based and also partly to  the necessity for obtaining authoritative legal advice  on certain pointsconnected with the powers of the Palestine Government underthe Mandate.  In this connection it should be recalled thatin July  1929, only a  month before the  disturbances, Sir JohnChancellor,  who had been  seeking for a long time to obtain information as  to the nature of the  &quot;rights&quot; involvedexplained to the Mandates Con-mission what action he was ttaking,  and the Commission agreed that that policy could notbe improved (see p.94 of the Minutes of the FifteenthSession).  It would appear inconsistent for the mandates commission to take the view that the policy,  of which they expressed approval in July 1929,  was in August 1929entirely wrong.          The third Conclusion of the  Commission is that thePalestine Government was,  in several instances,  taken bysurprise by events, and in this connection, the Commissionrefer to the inadequacy of the Intelligence Service.  the inadequacy of this service has already been recognised and steps are being tt-ken to remedy it.   The force,  however,  of                                               th i s
this conclusion depends  largely upon  the acceptance of theview expressed by -the Mandates Commission  that -there waspremeditation.  This was held by the  Shaw  Commission afterelaborate enquiry and examination  of  witnesses not to bethe case.  If there was, in fact,  no  premeditation, it ia,of course, not unnatural that the  local authorities shouldhave been taken by surprise by the events  which  occurred.          Conclusion (d) refers to the inadequacy of thea,rmed forces at the disposal of the local  Administration.His Maje8tyrs Government must point out that the reduction was carried out only with the ad.vice  of a  HighCommissioner to whose knowledge of the country was added the experience given by  a distinguished military career;that the reduction was a step in the  direction ofestablishing civil government on more normal lines than before;  and that it had the advantage of  making availablefor the development of the country funds which would otherwise have been expended on defence.   Nevertheless,in the light of subsequent events  it  cannot be denied thatthe forces immediately available were inadequate to dealwith the sudden and. widespread outbreak of disturbances;but when the C ommi s si on--&apos; gO&quot;es on to say in  its Reportthat it had &quot;several times&quot; drawn  the attention of theMandatory to the danger  of excessive  reduction of british forces, His Majesty1 s Government feel bound to point outthat the sole reference  quoted in  support  of such a state-ment hardly justifies the satisfaction which the mandates commission appear to feel in their own foresight.  &quot;Thepassage to which they refer in the Report  of the NinthSession (June 1926) runs as follows:-          &quot;The Commission note with satisfaction that                                            the
     the political unrest in the country is decreasing,     and that order has been preserved in all parts of     Palestine.  The Commission does not doubt that the     Mandatory Power will always have at its disposal     local forces capable,  by their composition and number     of preventing any trouble which might constitute a     menace to any part of the population.&quot;The only other reference which can be traced occurs inthe Report of the Seventh Session (October 1925) andruns as follows:-               &quot;The Commission notes with satisfaction     that the peace and order existing in Palestine has     enabled the mandatory Power to maintain only a very     small armed fores in the territory.&quot;          The Mandates Commission were fully aware ofwhat &quot;Forces were stationed in Palestine and when theywere considering; the Palestine Report only a month beforethe outbreak they gave no indication that they regardedthose Forces as inadequate and. it is difficult to see how the rather cordial expressions of confidence in theMandatory Power already quoted, can,  in the light of sub-sequent events^ be converted into serious warnings againstthe dangers of an inadequate Garrison.          The third sub-paragraph of the Conclusion (d)runs:-          &quot;is might have been expected in a country where     explosions of religious and racial events   have     constantly threatened the public peace, there was a     defection on the part of the native contingents as     soon as the rioting brought the two races into     conflict.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government are not aware on what grounds the mandates Commission regarded such result as expected.
The Commission have all along been aware of the composition ofthe Palestine Police Force and the various changes which havetaken place in it) and if it was to be expected that such a force would prove to be unreliable when tested it is sur-prising that the Commission should not have seriously warned the Mandatory Power at a much earlier date of the danger whichit was incurring in relying upon such a Force.  To maintainorder in a territory by a. Police Force from which the inhabi-tants of that territory are excluded is a policy which EisMajesty1s Government in the light of long and varied experienceare unable to view with favour and which is open to objection on political, admini strative ana financial grounds. They cannotfeel that they were without justification in adopting in thecase of Palestine, a system which has been attended with somuch success in many other Dependencies,  and which they have still reason to hope will yet justify itself in Palestine.          Paragraph 6 of the Report contains various charges,the substance.of which would appear to be that the MandatoryPower has failed,  in important respects,  to carry out theMandate.  In taking this view the Mandates Commission appearto have accepted,  without question,  the more extreme Jewishcontentions  regarding the meaning and object of the Mandate.The duty imposed on the Mandatory Power is not itself toestablish the Jewish National Home in Palestine,  which is the function of the Jews themselves directed by the Jewish Agency.The Mandatory Power is &quot;responsible for placing the country under such political,  administrative end economic conditions aswill secure the establishment of the Jewish National Home ...and the development of self-governing institutions and also for safeguarding the civil and religious rights of all the inhabi-tants of Palestine,  irrespective of race and religion.&quot; Thedifficulty, serious enough in itself, in fulfilling the first tvoobjects, is further increased by the addition of the third.                                                       The
          The further charge that Kis Majesty&apos;sGovernment have failed in their Mandatory obligationsvis a-  vis the Arabs by neglect of agricultural andother development is one which His Majesty&apos;s government feel they must deal with at greater length.    the mandates Commission seem to imply that a properdevelopment policy would have so increased the generalproductivity, prosperity and contentment of  thepopulation as to reconcile the non-Jewish sectionof the community to a progressively increasinginflow of Jewish immigrants.   Having regard to theunpromising local conditions, such a view assumes that practically unlimited funds for this purpose would be at the disposal of His Majesty *s Government.It implies, moreover, a fundamental misconception ofthe general policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government withregard to their overseas dependencies.   It hasbeen their consistent aim, j\.;stified by long experience,to emancipate as soon as possible such territoriesfrom dependence upon grants-in-aid from the british exchequer.   If a territory is to be developed on sound economic lines, it must be, in the opinionof His Majesty&apos;s Government, on the basis that it isself-supporting.   It is true that until recentyears it has been necessary to assist the Governmentof Palestine by.grants from the British Exchequer, andit may not be realised, in view of the charges brought against His Majesty&apos;s Government, that during the 4 years 1924 to 1927 inclusive, grants to the net amountof over  2,000,000, have been made in aid of localrevenue.   In addition, a loan of  4,500,000 was raised                                                 by
by the Palestine Government in 1927 on the guarantee ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government for expenditure upon railways,harbour construction, port improvements, and other public works.          It should further be pointed out that any policy of development in Palestine must take account ofthe obligations imposed by the Mandate.   This seems tohave been recognised by the Permanent Mandates Commissionin 1924, when, in the report on their Fifth Session,they write as follows:-  &quot;It is obvious that if theMandatory Power had. only to take into consideration theinterests of the population, its immigration policyought to be dictated primarily by considerations ofthe economic needs of the country.   It is, moreover,equally clear that if the Mandatory Power had not to take into account the interests of the Arab population, andif its sole duty was to encourage Jewish immigration inPalestine it might be in a position to pursue anagrarian policy which would facilitate and expedite toa greater extent than its present policy the creation ofa Jewish National Home.&quot;          Nevertheless, if account is taken of the fore-going general considerations His Majesty&apos;s Government feelthat it may justly be claimed that they have not beenneglectful of their obligations in regard to development.No reference, however, is contained in the report of thePermanent Mandates Commission to the work which hasalready been done in this direction by the MandatoryPower in developing and improving conditions in Palestine,and it is remarkable that the Mandates Commission, whohave always been kept fully informed of developnents in                                             Palestine,
Palestine, should not have been fit to draw attention tothe point at a much earlier date if they had reason to bedissatisfied with the rate of progress attained.          It may not be out of place to mention herebriefly some of the activities of the British Administra-tion, information as to which has been available to the mandates Commission in reports published by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.          A perusal of the Annual Reports by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to the League of Nations on the administrationof Palestine will reveal the increased benefits enjoyed by the inhabitants of Palestine as the result of theGovernment&apos;s activities in matters of education,agricul-ture, communications (roads, posts and telegraphs),health,sanitation, land tenure, etc.          The Government&apos;s activities in these mattersduring the period 1920-25 are described in the Report ofthe High Commissioner for Palestine (Sir Herbert Samuel)on the administration of Palestine 1920-25, which was published as Colonial No. 15 by His Majesty^ stationery office.          Education is dealt with on pages 13 and 14 ofthat Report.   It will be seen that as the result of the steps taken by the Government, 190 new schools were established during the period under review.  The majority,if not all, of these schools would be Arab schools.          So far as concerns Agriculture,Sir Herbert Samuelexpressed the view (on page 16) that the loons  issued tocultivators under arrangements made by the militaryauthorities went far to save the situation for  theagriculturists of Palestine.  The activities of theDepartment of Agriculture and Forests during that period                                                   were
were also clearly of great benefit to the agriculturists.Particular reference is invited to the measure taken withregard to tobacco, cultivation, referred to on page  17 of theReport,   On pages 8 and 9 of Sir Herbert Samuel&apos;s  Report,there appears a reference to the steps taken by the military administration and subsequently by the Palestine Governmentto improve and extend the road and railway systems.   on pages 9 and 10, it is stated that the postal services beforethe war were largely maintained by agencies established by certain of the Eurorjean powers; the telegraph system wasrestricted, and telephones non-existent.  Sir Herbert Samuelthen stated that a complete system, modelled on the BritishPost Office, has been established for these three purposes.          As regards public health, Sir Herbert Samuel expressedthe view that nowhere was there a more pressing need for action,and nowhere has greater progress been  achieved than in the sphere of public health.  He then proceeded to refer to the steps taken by the Government to combat malaria and otherdiseases.  He stated in connection with the anti-malarialmeasures, &quot;But what has already been accomplished is a source of deep satisfaction to the Government and to the bodies co-operating with it.  The results haAre been of incalculablebenefit to the people.  They are the best argument  and the strongest incentive to further effort on the same lines.&quot;          On page 23 Sir Herbert Samuel stated that the landsystem of the country was left under the Turks in a state of complete confusion, and he referred later on to the steps that were being taken with a view to the commencement of a properland settlement,a definite registration of titles,and arevaluation..          Sir Herbert Samuel made further&apos; reference to thebenefits derived by the population as a whole, on page 41 ofthe Report,, in the following terms;-                &quot;Under
      &apos;&quot;TJCnderr&apos;tdielr- (Aiitninlstrative Officers 1)auspices, there were signs of progress such as hadbeen unknown before.  Nearly 200 villages could show new schools.  Roads were being c onstructed inevery direction.  Several villages were provided with new water supplies.  Fresh land v/as being brought under cultivation.  Agricultural experts gaveuseful advice.  Tobacco growing was encouraged.Robbers were put down.   Old blood feuds were settled&quot;.       In the following paragraph the HighCommissioner referred to the steps which had beentaken to secure the permanent settlement on landsin the Jordan Valley on certain tribes of Beduinwho were cultivators of the lands.       As regards the period subsequent to 1925,attention is invited to the Annual Reports on theAdministration of Palestine for 1926, 1927, 1928 and1929.       Section 5 of the Annual Report for 1929contains a review of the Government&apos;s activities inthe educational sphere , together with a briefdescription of the system obtaining at the date ofthe British occupation.  There can be no doubt thatthere has been a vast improvement in the educationalfacilities offered by the Government, and the Arabsespecially, have benefited from this, since themajority of the schools directly maintained andadministered by the Government are Arabic schools.       Government activities in matters ofagriculture, communications, etc have continued, andfurther instances of the benefits derived by thepopulation
2i 2i d population,  subsequent  to  1925,  are  obtainable from the Annual Reports  referred to above.   In 1926 an outbreak  of  cattle  plague  was promptly  checked by vigorous  measures instituted by  the Palestine Government (page 45 of  the 1926 Report), while the Entomological Service was  engaged in anti-locust campaigns in 1928 and also  1929  (page 71 of the 19f8 Report  and page 101 of the 1929 Report).  An investigation is being  carried out into the question of  irrigation ( page 96 of the 1929 Report)  arid an Horticultural Service- lias been established under the control of a Citrus Fruit Specialist,  (page 98 of the 1929 Report).  An instance of Government assistance to Arab  cultivators is afforded by the case of the Beduin  in the Beer-Sneba district, who in 1927 were granted agricultural loans to the extent of $3?. 20 ,000 (page  52 of the 1927 Report).   Further improvements are recorded In the roads and railway- systems in the Reports for the period under review,while among other measures taken in the interests of public health, there have been established GovernmentOpthalmic Clinics (  page 36 of the 1926 Report)  and Child Welfare Centres (  page 42 of the 1927 Report).        Tm various public works carried out by theGovernment, and the Haifa harbour Works which are now in progress, afford employment for both Arabs and Jews.        In addition to the various activities of the Department of Agriculture already referred to, the following items may be mentioned - the establishment of experimental plots and a stock farm, the importation of stallions, bulls , donkeys , sheep, goats and poultry for the benefit of local stock farmers.;, the provision of expert agricultural advice and of a
 trained  veterinary staff.          An important consideration vitally        22$ affecting the development work of the Palestine Administration is difficulty with regard to the land system already mentioned above.  The difficulties of land settlement in Palestine are almost unparalleled, owing to the confusion in which the Land Register was left after the war.  Active steps have for a long time been taken to reduce chaos to order in this respect, hut it cannot but he a lengthy and complicated process, and many activities, such as the provision of financial assistance for cultivators, must to a large extent, be dependent upon the progress made towards its completion.   It should further be added that considerable misapprehension seems to exist on the question of State or wastetlands, the assumption being that large tracts of potentially productive land under the control of the State axe at present being kept idle owing to a backward development policy.  This is entirely untrue.  The extent of State lands available for such a purpose is extremely limited, and in the only case of a considerable area, namely, the Beisan Lands , steps to secure the permanent settlement of Arab cultivators have already been taken.          The foregoing paragraphs deal with the more serious criticisms levelled against His Majesty&apos;s Government by the Permanent Mandates Commission. The last part of their Report, dealing with future policy, will be further considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government, although they must say that on a preliminary examination they have failed to discover any constructive suggestions. In paragraph 8 ( page 9)     -----the Commission  express the opinion that &quot;in the interests of the restoration of a peaceful atmosphere in Palestine,                                                    t, n. f;
                                                   9 9 1                                                   hi h) itthe time has come to define the legal foundation11of the assertion that the obligations laid down by theMandate in regard to the two sections of thepopulation are of equal weight.   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment fail to see how anything can be added byway of gloss or authoritative exposition to theemphatic terms of the Mandate itself.  Matters ofthis kind arising as they do out of obligationsimposed by the Mandate, cannot  be defined in the formof a legal code.  His Majesty1 s Government would howeverwelcome any elucidation of this point, which theCouncil may care to offer.        His Majesty&apos;s Government would suggest thatif this report is read in tho tight of former reportsof the Permanent Mandates Commission on Palestine itwill be seen that there has beer, a change in theirattitude for which the facts of the situation dc notappear to give any justification.
         Note on Observations of permanent Mandates         Commission on the Anmal Report on the         AAAinistration Of Palestine, and Trans-Jordan.         jo? the year 3.939.        The only point on which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment wish to comment on the present occasionis the suggestion contained  in the generalobservation that the sections of the Animal report should be arranged in the order of subjects adoptedby the Commission for its annual examination.  HisMajesty&apos;s Government desire to point out that theReport has followed the same model for several years ,and it would obviously be Inconvenient, for purposesof reference, if the whole order of subjects were now to be changed.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentventure to suggest that an examination of the Reportmight be facilitated if the Commission were taiemselves.xto put the order of subjects adopted for its annualexamination in the same order as the sections ofthe annual report to which they refer.
