    [This Document  is the Property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                       Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1930.SECRET.   CP. 274 (30).                                  CABINET.India: the Political Situation in  the fourth week of July  1930.      MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR INDIA.   As the Cabinet  is.aware,  Lord  Irwin, in letters which have been  exchanged between  him and Sir  Tej  Bahadur Sapru  and Mr.  Jayakar,  authorised a visit  tothe Congress  leaders  who are in  prison.  The  text of these letters is  printed  inAppendix I.  It is highly probable that, within the next few clays, these emissarieswid make known to  the Viceroy on what  terms, if any, the  Congress is prepared  toabandon  the civil  disobedience  movement  and either themselves  participate,  orcountenance the participation of  others, in  the Round-Table Conference.  This will present an issue of first-class importance ;  laud, on the decision reached the wholecourse of future events in India may depend.   Recent developments of the situatiou are as follows: an  intensification  of the boycott and a classification of the Bombay mills into &quot; Swadeshi &quot; and &quot; non-Swadeshi,&quot;which may result in the  closing  of  mills and  the  discharge  of numbers of men.This must be considered in the light of the fact that the  Working Committee of the bombay  Textile Workers Unions, the Girni Ivamgar, which gave so much trouble lastyear,  has recently decided to join the  Congress movement.   Labour hitherto hasheld  aloof.  Further,  the  Bombay Government  has issued a  reminder to LocalAuthorities, which indicates that  these  authorities are beginning officially to take the side of the Congress,  as happened in Ireland  in Sinn Fein times.   I have already circulated  to the Cabinet^ Sir Frederick Sykes&apos; view,  and  I  now  add in Appendix ITtwo further letters.   It will be observed that, failing  some agreement with Congress,Sir F. Sykes personally considers  very strong  measures are needed.  The  cabinet should contemplate the possibility, if agreement is  not reached, of a demand for a defence  of the  Realm Act, or something like it, in Bombay.   In making  a decision on any offer which Congress  may tender, the Governmentfaces  the risk of severe criticism  due to the ignorance  of British public  opinion  asto the real  situation  in  India.   I have  had many conversations  with  qualifiedobservers (both official and non-official) arriving  from India, and these conversationshave confirmed  my belief as to  the grave dangers we are running  and the need ofsecuring peace.                                                                        W.  B.    25th July 1930.                                 APPENDIX  I.       Letter from Mr. Jayakar and Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru to the Viceroy, dated                                13th July  1930.Dear Lord Irwin,       We  would  beg leave  to  draw Your  Excellency&apos;s  attention to the  politicalsituation in  the country, which, in our opinion, makes it imperative that  some steps should be taken without any loss of time to restore  normal  conditions.  We are alive to the clangers  of the civil disobedience movement, with  which neither of us hassympathised or been  associated, but we  feel  that in  a contest  between  people and government  which  has involved  the adoption  of  a policy  of repression,  and the consequent embitterment  of  popular feeling, the true and abiding interests  of thecountry are apt. to be sacrificed.  We think  that it is our duty to our country and government that we should make an endeavour to ameliorate the present situation bydiscussing the question with some  of  the leaders of the movement in the hope andbelief that we may be  able to persuade  them to help in  the restoration of normalconditions.                                * See CP. 226 (30).     4671   75  7.30
   If we have read  Your  ExceJlency&apos;s speech  aright, we  think that, while  YourExcellency and your Government  feel  compelled to resist  the  civil disobedience movement, you are not less anxious to explore every possibility of finding  an agreed solution of the constitutional  problem.   We need  scarcely say that we believe that,with the cessation of the movement, there will be no occasion for the continuance onthe part of the Government  of the present policy and  those  emergency measureswhich have been  passed by  the Government to implement that policy.   We therefore approach Your Excellency  with the request that &quot;you may  be pleased to permit us to interview  Mr. Gandhi, Pandit Motilal Nehru, and Pandit JawaharlalNehru, so that we may put  our point of view  before  them,  and  urge them, in theinterests  of the  country,  to  respond to  our appeal  to enable the  big  issue of constitutional  advance  being  solved in  a  calm  atmosphere.   We desire  to make  itplaiu that in going to them we shall be going on our  own behalf, and that  we do notprofess to represent either the  Government  or any party in taking  this step.  If wefail in our attempt, the responsibility will be ours.   Should Your Excellency be pleased to grant ns permission to see these  gentlemenin gaol, we shall request you to issue the necessary orders to the  Local Governmentsconcerned to  allow  us the necessary facilities.   We  further  request  that,  if thenecessary permission  be granted  to 11s,  we may be allowed to talk to them privately,without  there being  any officer of the  Government present at our interview.  Wefurther  submit that, in our opinion, it  is  desirable that we should see them at theearliest possible date.              The Viceroy&apos;s Reply to Mr. Jayakar, dated 17th July 1930.Dear Mr. Jayakar,       I have received  your letter of 13th July, in which  you and Sir Tej BahadurSapru  state your  desire to do all in your power to bring about the return of peacefulconditions in the country, and ask permission to approach Mr. Gandhi, Pandit MotilalNehru, and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru with this object.   I had  occasion, in  my  address  to  the  Legislature on  9th July, to define theattitude of  myself and my  Government both  to the  civil disobedience movement and to the  constitutional issues.  We consider  that the civil disobedience movement is  doing unmixed harm to  the  cause  of India, and  many important communities,classes, and parties hold the same view.   With their help, therefore, the government must continue to oppose it by all the means  in their power.   But yon  rightly recognise that we are not less anxious  to see the achievement of asolution  of  the  constitutional  problem by  agreement   among  all  the  interests concerned.  It is evidently not possible for ine to anticipate the proposals that will  bemade by the Government of India after they have had time to consider the statutory commission^ Report, or by the Round-Table Conference, and  still less the decisionsof Parliament.  But I made it  plain in ray  speech  that it remains my earnest desire,as it  is that of my Government, and, I have  no doubt, also that  of His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment, to do everything we can in our respective spheres to assist the people ofIndia to obtain as large a degree of the  management of  their own affairs  as can  be shown to be consistent with  making provision for those matters  in  regard  to whichthey are not at x^resent  in a position  to  assume responsibility.  What those mattersmay he, and what provision  may best be made for them, will engage the attention ofthe Conference, but I have never believed that, with mutual confidence on both  sides,it should be impossible  to reach agreement.    if, therefore, you believe that by the action proposed you may be able to assist therestoration of normal conditions in the country, it  would not  be right for me or my government to interpose any  obstacles to  your efforts.  Nor do I think  that  thosewho have  stood side by side with my  Government  in  steadily opposing the civildisobedience movement, arid whose co-operation I  so much value, would  wish meto do so.   On  hearing from you  I will, accordingly, ask the  Local Governmentsconcerned  to issue the  necessary instructions  which  will enable you to make yourpublic-spirited attempt  in the cause of peace in  India.
                                 APPENDIX  II.     Letter from the Viceroy to Sir Frederick Sykes, Governor of Bombay,  dated                             Simla, 24th June 1930.     [Secret.]My dear Sjdies,    I have been just dictating a  telegram to you  that will reach you before you getthis, but I do not want to waste  time in attempting an answer to your long and mostinteresting letter of the 20th of June.&apos;?    lam under no temptation  to  minimise the nationalist drive that is behind thepresent movement, of which you are bearing the brunt, and I hope you will not thinkthat I am in any way  by what I  say showing myself insensible  to the  practicaldifficulties that confront you day by day.   I think I  can perhaps most convenientlystate what I have to  say with direct reference  to the particular paragraphs of your letter.    Para. 2.  You   say that it is  a  mass movement  which  cannot be dealt with  bycoercion without  involving  a  clash on  a  large  scale and  very  serious  political consequences.        In  this argument I think you Underrate the value of steady  pressure steadily     applied.   It  need not necessarily  be  dramatic  so  long  as  it  is  persistent.  I     cannot think that the present state  of feeling will last indefinitely or that,  those     who are  at present  financing  the  movement will not gradually  get  both tired     and frightened.    Para. 3 urges that, if we are to  fight the movement, we require much more drastic action  and powers.        Here again I believe  it  to be out  of the question to expect to crush  the whole     movement in any dramatic fashion, but 1  do not believe that this is  really the     alternative to the  policy,  in  which  you say  you have hitherto acquiesced,  of     using the minimum force  necessary to  meet the situation from day to day.  I     again prefer  the policy  of  steady pressure.   We have, in my view, got to use     whatever force is necessary  to keep the movement under  control.  The ultimate     settlement must be  dealt with independently.   It seems  to me analogous to the     state of affairs in the war.   We should never have  suggested  the employment     of only minimum  force  in  that respect on the ground that  peace had to come     some time later.    Para. 4  complains that our jn-esent  policy does not defeat  our enemies butalienates Liberals, and the fact that our enemies are not defeated makes neutralsincline to their side.        But this  may equally support my conclusion that we  should  proceed  more     steadily and perhaps more vigorously against our enemies in order that neutrals     may be left in no doubt that  while  we are fighting we mean to fight, naturally     desirous as we must be of avoiding unnecessary embitterment.    Para. 5.  Business is being ruined, aud the effect of this is to make people thinkthat any change of Government  would be welcome.        But may  not people gradually  come  to argue that the civil disobedience     movement is  achieving little except their own ruin  and be prepared to listen to     reasonable proposals of Government ?    Para. 0.  Police and minorities are being weakened and the ice is very thin.        My feeling here would  be  in  favour of  the conclusion  that, unless we are     prepared to capitulate on the enemy&apos;s terms, we must, by vigorous action, satisfy     them that we intend to remain on top and believe in our proposals.    Para. 7.   If the Liberals desert the Round-Table Conference, it is doomed.        It  is  of   course  possible  that, in  such  circumstances, the Round-Table   &apos;  Conference would  be ineffective,  though it would  not necessarily be dropped.     But I doubt  whether C. P.  Ramaswami  Aiyar from Madras,  Sastri,.Calcutta     &quot;Liberals, would, fall  out whatever  happened  to Setalvad  and  Co.  under the     influence of the more difficult  conditions in Bombay.  Jinnah told me last week   . that he did not believe for  a moment that  the Bombay Liberals would  run out.     But after all what is the  alternative?  Surely no  other  than  to purchase the     support of Liberals by capitulation to the  Congress.  I cannot  think this would     be good.                                 * See CP. 226 (30).
   Para. 8 urges that the Government  of  India  should define  their attitude towardsthe Simon Report, so as to regain the confidence of the more moderate elements.        I am disposed to agree with this  and contemplate  the possibility of getting    individual leaders from different parts to come and have a  talk, when the Report    has been out a week or two, much on the lines  that you suggested doing yourself    in your telegram of the 23rd.  I think it is  very important  to show people that    . neither we nor the Conference are  bound  by the litera  scripia  of  the  Simon    Report.        Para. 9.   I realise that Liberals and such like are genuinely anxious  for    political settlement, and 1 have them  constantly  in mind at the  present time.    The support they bring to us at the moment is  disappointing enough, but I fully    realise the importance of trying to help them.        Para. 10.   I think we shall have an explosion over the second Volume, but    I do not agree with your logical choice between               (a) undiluted repression and no reforms, and              (6)  conciliation with the object of isolating Congress.        Broadly speaking (6) of  course is  our  policy, but we  do  not  achieve  it by    letting Congress win and  by not  taking steps to figl.it them while  the movement    lasts.  The sole Liberal idea  of conciliation seems to me  to be that of placating    Congress on something very like Congress&apos;s own terms.        Para.  11.  1 am  afraid I do not accept your syllogism, if I  correctly    understand  it.  You  say,  in  effect,  &quot; undiluted  repression  is   not  feasible ;     construction  cum repression is not feasible ;  therefore we must conciliate.&quot; .  It    seems to me  indeed  that the right  and only policy is  conciliation cum s-o-callecl    repression,   i.e.  repression  where necessary,   but losing  no  opportunity  of    emphasising that a happier way is open when the  provoking causes of repression    no longer operate.        Para. 12.   I  therefore wholly agree with yen  when you  say that  it is  not a    question of  negotiation, but of making it plain that the attitude of the Govern-    ment of India is liberal.  I hope to be able to say something of this sort when I    speak to the Legislature, and  -I  am very grateful to you for the suggestions you    make as to the kind of thing that might be said.   2. Reading this through, I seem to have written rather dogmatically, but you willnot misunderstand me, and I have only  thrown  my remarks into  this form  for  the sake  of greater  lucidity.   As  I write,  I  have just  seen the  report of  MotilaTsstatement in the I.N.A. telegrams.  This may or  may not  be  significant, and I have called a meeting of my Council  to-night to consider whether or not this should affect our policy in regard to.him that  had  been communicated to you by telegram.  Itstrikes  me, reading it, as  if it was a  very definite attempt at approach which mightbe a mistake to choke, but I am naturally a trustful person.                                                              Yours ever,                                                                       IRWIN.       Letter from the Governor of Bombay to the Viceroy, dated G-aneshkhind,                               ^&apos;4th July 1930.    (Secret.)                  ;My dear Irwin,       I have several communications from you which I should like to answer, all ofwhich I was very glad  to receive ;  but I will-begin with  your telegram No. 551  S.,&apos;:;&quot; of25th  June, in which you referred  to my suggestion that I should  hold a conferenceof representative persons in Bombay.  I spent last  Monday and Tuesday in Bombaysounding representative.opinion about this and about the situation generally.  1 foundthai,opinion there was generally favourable, to the plan  and  thought that somethingmight come  of it.  I  decided, however, that it would  be  better not to  hold theconference immediately, both because it could not be confined to  Bombay people, and because in any, ease I thought it better  to await your announcement of  the 9th  July,following which 1 have a short  tour to make. -  I have therefore finally decided  to fix the conference  for the 15tli and 16th Juljr, unless there is anything of  importance inwhich t could assist you by holding it sooner.  Meanwhile, a&apos;s it did not seem desirable                           * Not received at tho India Oflice.
 to address the Legislative Council before your address to the Legislative Assembly, T am proposing to make a winding-up speech to the Council on the 17th July, the day before I leave for Simla for the Governors&apos; Conference.    2.  Your memorandum on general policy, enclosed  with your letter of the 22nd June, has reached  me  since 1 last wrote, and  this and your letters of the 24th and 27th June, in answer to  mine of the 20th and 23rd, have helped  me to  gather the point of  view of the Government of India.   I realise that what I have to say now represents only the Bombay  aspect, and perhaps particularly the aspect of Bombay City, but I think it may be of importance for you  to know it before your address to the Assembly.    3.  While you do not, I  see, admit that  the choice of alternatives  before the Government of India is exactly as stated  in para. 10 of my letter of  the  20th June, your letter of the 24th and  your telegram of  the  25th tell me what  I did  not then know, namely,  that conciliation, as I  then  understood  and still  understand it, is now viewed as an integral part of the policy of  the Government of India.  Perhaps I may explain that I obviously did not regard conciliation as equivalent either to negotiation or to capitulation.  I felt, however, that if our intentions in dealing with the Report of the Simon Commission  and the constitutional question generally were such  as would reassure  and  rally moderate opinion, everything was to be gained by  declaring them at the earliest possible moment  in order to prevent  bitterness from  increasing.   I suppose  I may  also take it that  it is the  hope of the Government of India that  a solution  of  the present impasse  will  be  reached  along these  lines rather than by means of forcible repression.   Hence the main qriestion before us is how conciliation can  be given the best  possible chance in restoring normal feelings  and isolating the irreconcilable element.   4. It is here that there seems to  be some divergence in our views, in  that you regard  this policy as not only compatible  with,  but  even likely to  be  helped by &quot; steady  pressure &quot;  on the Congress  organisation.   Evidently your  view is based on two  assumptions, which I fully recognise may be true  of Tndia as a whole, but from which I  fear that Bombay City, and,  at any rate, most  of Gujarat, must be excepted. The assumptions seem  to be,  firstly, that the Congress  movement is not of a national character and that, therefore, secondly, the Congress  can be isolated,  for  purposes of attack, while leaving the bulk of the population  unaffected and still open  to conciliation.   5. The reason why I have perhaps sometimes seemed to you to underrate the value of what you call &quot; steady pressure &quot; is that in the atmosphere which has long existed in Bombay City, it seemed impossible, when  once we began to employ pressure,  to prevent it from going much further than the Congress proper, and involving the bulk of the population.  In so doing we could not avoid  alienating most of  those to whom conciliation is intended to appeal.  It was for this reason that I have all along been so anxious to know what the policy of the Government of India really was, because until we knew whether a conciliatory statement was contemplated and could judge its likely effect on non-Congress opinion, we could not tell how far an  increase of pressure was likely  to lead  us.   As  things are in  Bombay City to-day,  effective repression  of the Congress activities is not really compatible with the conciliation of  others, because the public will not allow themselves  to be  kept out of  it.  Those who know Bombay well tell  me that they  have  never known anti-Government feeling so high and  so widespread.  The population  as a whole seems to have been carried awray on a wave of semi-hysterical enthusiasm, and even Parsis and Christians, women and children, are  possessed with the mania  for martyrdom.   It is in fact a mass movement,  or rather a general middle-class movement, and  even the most responsible people are either infected by it or do not dare to stand up against it.  You may perhaps say  that things would not have gone so  far if the  Congress  activities had been suppressed earlier.  This is, of course, only a matter of opinion, but the way in which the feeling has surged up from the time when we took the first steps to disperse assemblies  and processions by force, rather indicates  that  we were right in not wishing to take such action until conciliation, if contemplated, had had.a chance.   6. I find now in Bombaj7 City that Government  have scarcely  a friend, and even the Europeans, who a short time ago were  loudest in demanding  strong  measures against Congress processions,  are; now openly advocating negotiation or  laissez fairs to save  themselves  from the  threat of  business boycott.  I am  not  defending  this attitude.   I am merely stating facts, and, while it is clear that a conciliatory statement     4671 &apos;                                                               B
will not have its intended effect if those to whom it is addressed are further alienated,it seems increasingly doubtful to me whether in any case, the Bombay public will beprepared to support  Government in any clash with the Congress volunteers.  Thereare many, of course, who genuinely dislike the  methods of the Congress ;  but theirsympathy for its objects  is such that they are ready to tolerate anything done by theCongress while disapproving of everything done  by. Government against it.   7. Another point on  which  you have arjparently not  quite understood what  Imeant, and  on which I should therefore like to make myself more clear, is as regardsthe possibility and implications of what I have called &quot; effective repression.&quot;  I havenever said  that effective repression was  not feasible.  Jt is feasible, at least for  solong as we  are prepared to light a national  movement  in this way ;  but what I have said is that if we are to adopt this method in the present atmosphere, particularly in bombay, we cannot  long prevent things from reaching  the stage at which extreme-and even &quot;dramatic&quot; action becomes inevitable.   We therefore always hoped thatthe policy  of conciliation would become effective  before  anything  had to be done which would cause unnecessary bitterness.   8. If, however, the  announcement now  to be  made  does not  win  back  theModerates to an  extent  sufficient to  isolate  the Congress  (and, as I have  said, it isvery  doubtful  if they will ever lose  their sympathy with the Congress), then  I  donot believe in prolonging the conflict by any half measures.  If &quot; steady  pressure &quot;means anything like a repetition of the events since last January, it is too exhaustingfor the Police and for all our officers, and I. consider that it will be  our duty to take effective steps to put down the movement  as soon as possible.   The Ordinances whichwe have now got will, of course, materially  add to our power of  applying pressureeffectively.  But if conciliation fails we shall sooner or later get into the position inwhich all our  forces will be required,  and  in  my  opinion, the only sound policy would be to mobilise them at once and strike  effectively.   You, yourself,  have  used the analogy of  war,  but  in war the aspect of  &quot;repression cum  conciliation &quot; does notarise ; you  put into effect every ounce  of  pressure of which  you   are  capable  tobreak the enemy&apos;s will.   Such a policy, as applied to India, implies the denial of a constitution by consent, and that is why I suggested that  effective repression would put the clock back as regards constitutional reforms.    9. At the present moment everything depends on the effect of your own statement to the Assembly or of any statement made by His Majesty&apos;s Government.   The termsof  any  announcement   are  probably  very  largely decided  already,  but 1 would emphasise that, as indicated in my telegram  of the 2nd July in the present temper ofthe people in  Bombay they will not respond to any statement which does not makecategorical  promises.  Still less  will Gandhi  or  the Congress  give up the  advantagethey  believe themselves to have gained for the  sake of  anything  which is at  allnebulous.   I am sure I am right in saying that they will judge any such statement inthe light of what it definitely implies  about the future constitution of India, and thatassurances about ancillary matters, such as the withdrawal of powers  or the release ofprisoners,  will tempt neither the Congress nor  the public.  But, as  I  said before, Ihave hopes that the  public and perhaps even  the Congress will be glad at the present justice to call off the movement in return for anything which they judge to be really substantial.  I found   in Bombay there was  all-round  disappointment at Pandit Motilal&apos;s arrest, not  so much  because  he  was the Congress leader as because it was thought his recent statement had indicated his  readiness to negotiate.   I do not here. speak of negotiation in the strict sense in which you explain it  in your letter of the 27th, but in the more general sense of being willing to respond to  any satisfactory announcement from yourself on the substantive questions.    10. You will gather from all I have  said  that I  still think that the alternatives before us are real ones either to  mend the situation through diplomatic means or to end it by adopting really effective measures.  If we do not succeed in the former, the latter will inevitably  be forced  upon  us.  It is  unnecessary for  me  further  to emphasise  the  position here ; I need  only say that both economically and psychologi- cally it  is  one  of great gravity, and that if  we allow the second contingency to arise, we may sooner or later find ourselves deprived of free choice by the chaos resulting from a breakdown of the whole  economic fabric of society which, although arising in Bombay City, must  necessarily have a profound effect elsewhere. .    11. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary of State to  see.                                                            Yours sineerely,                                                                 P. H. SYKES.
