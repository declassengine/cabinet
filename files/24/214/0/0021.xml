AS my colleagues are aware, the pressure on His Majesty&apos;s Government to publish the correspondence which passed between Sir H. McMahon and the SherifHusein of Mecca in 1915-16 has recently been renewed.  This pressure arises  fromthe contention of the Palestinian Arabs and their supporters that  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  have broken  pledges  guaranteeing the  independence  of  Palestine.Previous Governments have consistently maintained the attitude (a) that the extracts from  the  correspondence which have been quoted  involve  no such pledge to theinhabitants of Palestine; (b) that it  would not  be in the public interest to publish the correspondence.   In view, however, of the attitude shown by members of theHouse of Commons in the debate  on  the adjournment on the 7th May, I have beenled to the conclusion  that it is desirable that we should review the whole  positionafresh with a view to satisfying  ourselves whether,  on the  one hand, it would bepossible or desirable to meet the demand for publication in whole or in part, or, ifnot, in what form our decision can best be promulgated.    As a first step, by arrangement with the Foreign Office,  who are particularly concerned with this matter, the whole history of this  correspondence and a reasoned        taccount of its implications has been prepared  by an expert (Mr. Childs) on theForeign Office staff.  I am prepared to say that at no time hitherto has so complete and exhaustive  a work on  the  subject  been  available.   Unfortunately,  thoughinevitably, Mr. ChiloVs work is of a compass with  which it  will be impossible to expect my colleagues to cope,  since, for  Parliamentary reasons,  it  is considered necessary to arrive  at a decision  before the close of  the current session.   I annex,however, a summary (with excerpts)  of the correspondence itself.    I have studied  the correspondence with the  various comments which have beenmade on it,  and have come to  the following conclusions (in  which the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and  the Secretary of State for India concur) :     (1) Sir H. McMahon (as well as Lord  Kitchener) encouraged the Sherif to rebelagainst the Sultan-Khalif at  Constantinople  and to seek the Khalifate for himself with British assistance.    While the Caliphate itself has ceased to be a burning question, the disclosure of this encouragement would -still at any time suffice to provoke a violent  outburst of resentment against His Majesty&apos;s Government  throughout Islam, as  well as,probably,  faction controversies among the Arabs  themselves.  In the present state ofaffairs in India, Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East,  infinite harm would bedone, and it is not possible to  envisage a date when harm would not be done.   Forthis reason  alone. I think it will be agreed that publication  in full is out of thequestion.    (2) The question whether Palestine was  included within the boundaries of theproposed Arab State  is in itself  extremely complicated.  From an examination ofMr. Childs&apos;s able arguments, I have formed the judgment that there is a fair case for saying that Sir  H. McMahon  did not commit His Majesty&apos;s Government in this sense.  But I have also come to the conclusion that there is much to be said on bothsides and that the  matter is one for the  eventual judgment of the  historian, andnot one in which a simple, plain and convincing statement can be made.  There       [214391                                                         %
 would not,  therefore, appear to be any advantage in publishing a reasoned inter - pretation with  extracts from  the  correspondence.  Such  a publication would not prevent,  but would even  tend to provoke,  renewed  controversy.  Further  the publication of extracts would  lead to a  demand  for  the  publication of the whole correspondence, and the inevitable refusal  would only encourage  suspicions that passages  bearing  adversely on  the  views advanced by His Majesty&apos;s Government had been  suppressed.     (3) A further point which  has  to be made is that the correspondence in question took place with  the Sherif Husein,  and that any undertakings which may have been entered into by His Majesty&apos;s Government were  to him  alone, as the head of the projected Arab State.  No obligations were entered into with the Palestinian Arabs.     (4) In all these circumstances,  I feel  that only a short statement on the subject is possible.   This statement might, if my colleagues concur,  be in the following sense :          &quot; His Majesty^ Government have been impressed by  the feeling shown in     the House of Commons on various occasions, and especially in the  debate on the     Adjournment on the 7th May,  with  regard  to the correspondence  which took     place in 1915-16 between Sir Henry McMahon and the Sherif Husein of Mecca.     They have,  therefore, thought it  necessary to re-examine this correspondence     fully in the light of the history of the period and the interpretations which have     been put upon it.         &quot; There are still valid reasons, entirely unconnected with  the question of     Palestine,  which  render it in  the highest  degree  undesirable in the public     interest to publish the correspondence. These reasons may  be expected to retain     their force for many years to come.         &quot; There are not sruncient grounds for holding that by this correspondence    His Majesty&apos;s Government intended to pledge themselves, or did, in fact, pledge    themselves,  to the inclusion of Palestine in the projected  Arab State.   Sir H.    McMahon has himself denied that this was his intention.  The ambiguous and    inconclusive nature  of the correspondence may  well, however,  have  left an    impression  among those who  were  aware  of the  correspondence that His    Majesty&apos;s Government had such an intention.&quot;    I had hoped that it might be possible to publish a White Paper giving  theconclusions of His Majesty&apos;s Government and some account of the  reasons  leading to them.   It would seem, however,  that for the reasons outlined above it would be undesirable  to  enter into  any  detail, and there  will not, therefore, be sufficientmaterial  to justify the production of a White Paper.   In these circumstances,  theproposed  statement  could  best be made  in reply  to   a question  in the House  ofCommons.                                                                      P.    Colonial Office, July 25, 1930.                                  ANNEXUKE.         Summary (with Extracts) of McMahon-FLusein Correspondence.First Letter from the Sherif (S. 1 of l&amp;h July, 1915).     IN this letter (S. 1) the  Sherif of Mecca  stated the conditions  on which he proposed co-operation with Great Britain against the Turks, and came at once to the vital matter of boundaries for the Arab State in the following wrords :           &quot; England to acknowledge the independence of the Arab countries, bounded     on the north  by Mersina and  Adana up to 37Q of latitude,  on which degree     falls Birijik, Urfa, Mardin, Midiat, Amadia Island (Jezireh), up to the border     of Persia; on  the east by  the borders of Persia up to the Gulf of Basra; on the     south, by the Indian Ocean, with the exception of the position of Aden to remain     as it is; on the west,  by the Red Sea, the Mediterranean Sea up  to Mersina.&quot;     The last two  lines of the foregoing definition clearly  include Palestine.     By their proclamation of June 1914 His Majesty&apos;s Government had committed themselves to insisting, when it came to making a treaty of peace, &quot; that the ArabianPeninsula  should  remain in the  hands of an independent Sovereign State.&quot;  Butthey had  added the qualification that at present it was  not  possible to define the
exact territory to be included in the State.   Sherif  Husein had received he decla-ration;  he now rejected the limiting  qualification  and  sought to impose  on  HisMajesty&apos;s Government an immediate and precise definition of the boundaries of thefuture Arab State.First Letter from Sir H McMahon to the Sherif (M.  1 of 30th August, 1915).     To  this communication Sir H. MeMahon replied on  the 30th August, 1915 itwas  the first of his  letters  (Al. 1) to the Sherif.  He  reaffirmed Lord Kitchener&apos;spromises to Emir&apos; Abdullah; declared  once more  that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould welcome the assumption of the  Khalifate by an Arab  of true race; but hefenced  with  the question  of  boundaries, declaring that discussion of  them was&quot; premature.&quot;     The second letter from the  Sherif (S. 2), dated  the 9th September,  1915, dealtwith the matter in  a way that admitted of no  further  delay in  discussing the boundaries he claimed.Second Letter from Sherif to Sir H. McMahon [S. 2 of 9th September, 1915).    He wrote to Sir H. McMahon  on the 9th September,  1915 (Letter  S. 2), asfollows :           &quot; Your Excellency will pardon me and permit  me to say clearly that the    coolness and hesitation  displayed in the question of  the limits and boundaries,    by saying that the discussion of these at present is of no use and loss of time and    that they are  still in the hands  of the Government which is ruling them, &amp;o,    might be taken to infer an estrangement or something of that sort.         &quot;As the limits and boundaries demanded are not those of one person whom    we  should satisfy,  and  with  whom we should  discuss them after the war  is    over,* but our  peoples have seen that the life of this new proposal is bound at    least by these limits and their  word is united on  this.         &quot;Therefore  they have found it necessary  to discuss this point first with    the Power in whom they now have their confidence and trust, viz., the illustrious    British  Empire.&quot;Sir  H.  McMahon   Telegraphs   to  the  Secretary of  State  for  Instructions         (19th October, 1915).    On the 19th October, Sir H. McMahon sent a private telegram to Sir  E.  Grey,detailing  information given by  Faroki,  a  prominent  Syrian  Nationalist.   Thefollowing important passages occur in this telegram : -         &quot; It appears evident, from conversation with Faroki  .... that the Arab    party are at the parting of the ways.  Germany, he says,  has promised them    the fulfilment of all their demands, and  they will throw in their lot with that    country unless we can  give them immediate assurance of a nature to satisfy    them.  Should the Arabs decide to throw in their lot with Germany,  we shall    find all  Islam  in the East united against the Allies.   On the other hand, their    active co-operation  with  us,  which they seem ready  to  offer,  will  greatly    influence the course of the campaign in Mesopotamia and Syria. The matter is    urgent, as further hesitation on the part of the Arab Party is impossible.  They    must act before Germany sends  further assistance to Turkey.  The possibility    of the Young Arab Party eventually becoming as troublesome as the Young-    Turk Party &quot;must  be  carefully  borne in mind, which  adds greatly to the    difficulties of our decision.  The opinion  expressed by Faroki is, I understand,    that assurance on the following lines would be acceptable to the Arab Party         &quot; &apos; In so far as she is  free to act without detriment to the interests of her    present  Allies,  Great  Britain accepts the  principle of  the independence of    Arabia  within  limits  propounded  by the  Sherif of  Mecca,  under  British    guidance and control.  When situation admits, England will give the Arabs her    advice, and  help them  to establish, in the territories concerned, whatever may    appear the most suitable form  of Government.   The Arabs will in this territory    recognise  the influence  of  Great Britain  only:  they will work under  British    guidance  and  control,  and will  recognise the  interests of  Great Britain as                        * An illusion to the Syrian Nationalists.      [21439]                                                        B 2
     paramount.  To this end,  such  British Residents,  Advisers or Officials as may     be necessary to ensure sound administration will be recognised, but Arab Chiefs     will continue to rule in the Arabian Peninsula itself.  England to guarantee the     Holy  Places against external aggression and recognise their inviolability.&apos; &quot;         &quot;The occupation by Trance of purely Arab  districts  of Aleppo, Hama,     Homs and Damascus would be opposed by Arabs with force of arms,* but with     this exception Faroki  thinks  they  would  accept some modification of the     North-Western boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca.         &apos;&apos; With regard to  Basra Vilayet,  Faroki accepts  the fact that special     measures of British control  will  be necessary,  in view  of Great  Britain&apos;s     interest  there.         &quot;Taking into consideration the Sherif&apos;s letter [of  the  9th September,     1915] in the light of views expressed by Faroki,  I am of opinion that no less     wide  assurances would  be likely to be regarded as acceptable to the Sherif or     the Arab Party.         &quot;I should be  glad to receive your instructions as to the reply I should give     the Sherif, and what assurances I may give through Faroki to the Arab Party.&quot; The Secretary of State&apos;s Instructions to Sir H.  McMahon (2Qth October. 1915).     On the  20th October, 1915, the Secretary of  State,  in  reply to  the foregoing telegram,  gave Sir  H.  McMahon  the following instructions, contained in Foreign Office telegram No. 796, of that date  :           &quot; You are authorised to give cordial assurances on the lines you propose in     your personal telegram of the 19th October, and  with your suggested reserve     about our Allies.         &quot; Unless it is  necessary,  in order to  secure Arab consent, you should not     include  the  stipulation that they will recognise British interests  as paramount     and work under British  guidance,  &amp;c.    Such stipulation  might give rise in     France to the impression that we are aiming not only at the securing of  Arab.     interests, but  also  at the establishment of our own interests in Syria at the     expense of the French.         &quot;Holy  Places  and  Mesopotamia.  There are  no difficulties on this  point     and you may speak without reserve.   But the general reserve, which you propose     is, more especially North-West boundaries, most necessary.         &quot; Mesopotamia.  In view of the special interests of the Bagdad Province    - and area actually  in our occupation, the proposed sphere  of British control,     namely,  the Basrah  vilayet,  will need  extension.  This will  not,  of course,     prejudice our interests with Arab chiefs.         &quot; To give an assurance that will prevent the alienation  of the Arabs is the     most important thing, and  as the matter is urgent and  time will not admit of     the discussion of an exact formula, I must leave you discretion in this matter.         &quot; Unless something more  precise is required, and in that case you may give     it, the simplest plan would be to give assurance of Arab independence, adding     that, if they will send their representatives, we will proceed at once to discussion     of boundaries.&quot;&apos; Second Letter from Sir H. McMahon to the Sherif (M. 2 of 24\th October, 1915).     I have received your letter  [of the 9th September] with much pleasure, and your expressions of sincerity and friendliness have given me the greatest satisfaction.     I regret  that you should have  received from my last letter the impression that I regarded the question of the boundaries with coldness and hesitation; such was not the case, but it appeared to me the moment had  not  arrived when  they  could be profitably  discussed.     I have realised, however,  from your last letter that you regard this question as one of vital  and urgent importance.   I  have therefore lost  no time in informing the Government of Great Britain of the contents of your letter; and it is with  great pleasure that I communicate to Arou on their behalf the following statement, which I am confident you will receive with satisfaction :      The districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and the portions of Syria lying to the West  of  the districts of Damascus, Homs,  Hama and Aleppo, cannot be said to     * Here  we  see how Sir II. McMahon  came to adopt this phrase of Faroki&apos;s as defining the minimum area the Arabs would accept in Syria without  fig-litinjr.  Clearly the phrase was meant to have no  narrow interpretation the wider the interpretation given to the word &quot; districts&apos;&quot; the better for the Arabs.
be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the proposed limits and boundaries.*With the above modification, and without prejudice to  our  existing treaties withArab chiefs, we accept these limits and boundaries, and in regard to these portions of the territories therein in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment tothe interests of her Ally, France, I am empowered in the name of the Governmentof Great Britain to give the following assurances, and made  the following reply to your letter :          &quot; Subject  to  the  above  modifications,  Great  Britain  is  prepared  to    recognise and support the independence  of  the Arabs  within  the territories    included in the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca.  Great    Britain will guarantee the Holy Places against  all external aggression and will    recognise their inviolability.         &quot; When the situation admits, Great  Britain will give to  the  Arabs her    advice and will assist them to establish what may appear  to be the most suitable    forms of government in those various territories.         &quot; On the other hand, it  is understood that  the Arabs have decided to seek    the  advice and  guidance of  Great  Britain only,  and  that  such European    Advisers and officials as may be required for  the formation of a sound form of    administration will be British.         &quot; With regard to  the vilayets  of  Bagdad and Basrah, the Arabs will    recognise  that  the  established  position and  interests  of  Great  Britain    necessitate special measures of administrative control in order to secure these    territories from  foreign  aggression,  to  promote the  welfare  of the local    popvdation and to safeguard our mutual economic interests.         &quot; I am -convinced that this declaration will assure you beyond all possible    doubts  of  the sympathy  of Great  Britain  towards  the aspirations of her    traditional friends, the Arabs, and will result in a firm and lasting alliance, the    immediate results of which will be the expulsion of the Turks from the Arab    countries and the freeing of the Arab peoples from the Turkish yoke, which for    so many years has pressed heavily upon them.....&quot;    Sir II. McMahon added  that, if any  outstanding points had been inadequatelydealt with, he hoped to be able to clear them up at an early date.The Sherif s Reply (S. 3) of 5th November, 1915, to Sir H. McMahon&apos;s Letter (M. 2)         of 24th October, 1915.    Sir  H. McMahon&apos;s Letter (M. 2) of the 24th  October,  1915,  to  the Sherif,conveying His Majesty&apos;s Governments pledges and reservations, reached Mecca onthe 2nd November, and the Sherif replied on the 5th November (S. 3).  The  passageswhich deal with boundaries in Syria are  as under :          &quot; In order to facilitate an agreement and to render a service to Islam, and,    at the same time,  to avoid  all that may cause Islam troubles  and hardships     seeing, moreover,  that  we  have great  consideration  for the distinguished    qualities and dispositions of the Government of Great Britain we renounce    our  insistence on  the  inclusion of the vilayets of Mersiua and Adana  in the    Arab Kingdom.  But the provinces of Aleppo and Beirut  and their sea coasts    are purely Arab provinces, and there is no difference between a Moslem and a    Christian Arab; they are both descendants of one forefather.&quot;    He then included an assurance that Arab Nationalists would observe the rightsand privileges of Christian and Arab alike  in the future State.         &quot;They &apos;,&apos;  [the  Christians], he added, &quot;will thus  enjoy their civic  rights    inasmuch as it accords with the general interest of the whole nation.&quot;    In his concluding paragraph he wrote :  &quot; The arrival  of  a clear  and definite answer as soon as possible to the above proposals is  expected.....&quot;   * This is the sentence which has led to controversy.  The words I have underlined are those adoptedfrom El Faroki.  &quot;Syria,&quot; it should be noted, is it geographical name which, until the System of Mandatescame into) aj^iicatiofr&apos;&apos;herei Vas ^rierajlj, understood- to, include I \i U-st ine..
Sir H. McMahon&apos;s Reply (M. 3) of 18th December, 1915, to the Sherif&apos;s Letter (S. 3)         o/    November,  1915.    Sir H. McMahon replied to the Sherif in a letter dated the 18th December, 1915,from  which the following  quotations should be given :          &quot; I am gratified to observe that you agree to the exclusion of the vilayets of    Mersina and Adana from the  Arab territories.         &quot; I also note with great pleasure and satisfaction your assurances that the    Arabs are determined to act in conformity with the precepts laid down by the    Caliph Omar, and the early Caliphs, which secure the rights and privileges of    all religions alike.          ^           ^fc           ^                       4fc         &quot;With regard to the vilayets of Aleppo and Beirut the Government of    Great Britain have talcen careful note of your observations, but, as the interests    of our ally, France, are involved, the  question will require careful consideration,     and a further communication will be  addressed to you in due course.          ******         &quot; We fully appreciate your desire for caution, and have no wish to urge     you to hasty action which might jeopardise the eventual success of your projects,     but,  in the meantime, it  is most essential  that you  should  spare no effort to     attach all  the  Arab  people to our  united  cause  and urge  them to afford no     assistance to our enemies.          &quot; It is on the success of these efforts and on the more active measures which     the Arabs may hereafter take  in support of our cause, when  the time for action     comes, that the permanence and strength of our agreement must depend.          &quot;Under these circumstances I  am further directed  by  the Government of     Great Britain to inform you that you may  rest assured  that Great  Britain has     no intention of concluding any peace in terms of which the freedom  of the Arab     peoples from  German and Turkish  domination  does  not  form  an essential     condition.          &quot; As an earnest  of our intentions and in order to aid you in your efforts in     our joint cause, I am  sending you a sum  of  20,000.&quot;The Sherif&apos;s Reply (S. 4) of 1st January, 1916, to Sir H. McMahon&apos;s Letter (M. 3)         of 13th December, 1915.    The Sherif replied  on  the 1st  January, 1916, in a letter  of  which only thefollowing passages need be noticed here :          &apos;&apos; We have received from the  bearer your two letters dated the 9th Safar    (the 18th December,  1915) Avith great respect and honour, and I  have understood    their contents,  which caused me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction,  as they    removed that which had made me uneasy.          *           *           *           *           *           *         &quot; As regards the northern parts and their coasts,  we have already stated    in our previous letter what were the utmost possible modifications;  and all this    was only done  so [as] to fulfil those aspirations whose attainment is desired by    the  wili of the Blessed and Supreme God.  It is this  same  feeling and desire    which impelled us  to avoid what may possibly  injure the alliance of Great    Britain  and France and the agreement made between them during the present    wars and calamities; yet we find it our duty that the eminent Minister should    be sure that, at the first opportunity  after this war is finished,  we shall  ask you    (what we avert our eyes from to-day) for what we now leave to France in Beirut    and its coasts.*         &quot; I do not find it necessary to  draw your attention to the fact that our plan    is of greater security to  the interests  and presumption of the rights of Great    Britain than it is to us;  and will necessarily be so whatever may happen, so that    Great Britain  may  finally  see all her own peoples in that contentment and    advancement -which she is endeavouring to establish for  them now; especially as    her Allies, being neighbours to us,  will be the germ of difficulties and discussion,    *  In reserving his claim to &quot; Beirut and its coasts&quot; until after the War the Sherif must have meant the coasts  of  the vilayet of Beirut.-. (See Map,  Appendix 1.)   He thus  accepted, until after the  War,  the exclusion of that part of the present Palestine which was part of the vilayet of Beirut.
     with which there will be no peace of mind.   In  addition to which, the people of     Beirut  will decidedly never  accept such isolation, and they may oblige  us to     undertake new measures which may exercise Great Britain, certainly not less     than her present troubles, because of our belief and certainly in the reciprocity     of our interests, which is the only cause that caused us never to care to negotiate     with any other Power  but you.*  Consequently it is impossible to allow any     derogation  that gives France, or any other Power, a space of  land in  these     regions. ...&quot;Sir H. McMahon&apos;s Reply (M. 4) of 25th January, 1916, to the Sherif s Letter  (S. 4)         of 1st January, 1916.     The letter that Sir II. McMahon sent in acknowledgment of the Sherifs of the1st January, 1916, is dated  the 25th January, 1916.  The following passages shouldbe quoted :             ******         &quot; As regards the northern parts,  we note with satisfaction your  desire not     to do anything which might possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and     France. It is, as  you  know, our  fixed determination that nothing shall be     permitted  to  interfere  in the  slightest degree  with the united  prosecution of     this war to a victorious conclusion.  Moreover  when the victory has  been won,     the  friendship of Great  Britain and France  will become  yet more firm and     enduring, cemented by the blood of Englishmen and Frenchmen  who  have died     side by side fighting for the Cause of Right and Liberty.         &quot; In this great Cause Arabia is  now  associated,  and.  God  grant that the     result   of  our  mutual  efforts  and  co-operation will  bind us  in  a  lasting     friendship to the mutual welfare and happiness of us all.         &quot; We leave  it to your discretion to seize the most  favourable moment for     farther and more decided measures.         &quot; You will doubtless inform us by bearer of this letter  of  any manner in     which we can assist you, and your requests will always receive our immediate     consideration.&quot;The Sherifs Reply (S. 5) of 18th February, 1916, to Sir H. McMahon&apos;s Letter (M. 4)         of 25th January,  1916.     To this the Sherif replied on the 18th February, 1916 :          &quot;... . Your Excellency&apos;&quot;s  letter  [of the  30th January] and its contents     filled us with the utmost pleasure and satisfaction  at  this  attainment of the     required understanding and the intimacy desired.....&quot;     The Sherif then went on to explain  his plans for beginning the Rising,  and,under eight heads, gave details  of the  material help he required  immediately  fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government:    50,000  in  gold monthly for payment of the  troops;so  many  thousand  sacks of  foodstuffs; so  many  thousand   rifles;  so  muchammunition, &amp;c.o    * 1 Ins sentence has been quoted again and again as a detached/categorical and emphatic declaration by the Shenf that he would not abandon his claim to anv part of the Syrian littoral.  It certainly is not that. It must be read in connexion with the whole of the long and involved  paragraph which it completes.It is then seen to be an appeal to Great Britain, more in &quot;the interests and presumption of the rights ofGreat Britain than it is to us [the Arabs]&quot; not to allow &quot; France or any other Power,&quot; to obtain a footingin Northern Syria or  on  the  Syrian  coast.   The  apparently miniatory sentence which precedes&quot; Consequently, &amp;c,&quot; is rather a warning of the  unrest and trouble to be expected among the Arabs ofBeirut vilayet if they found themselves permanently excluded from the Arab State.
