 i, DOOUtoBiiT IS THE PROPERTY OB&apos; HIS BRITAMHIC MAJESTY^ GOVERHtaEHT. RET.                                                    COPY NO.     ^0t^fS5(30)                                                &quot;         &apos;   &quot;                                  CABINET.                        RATIFICATION OP THE &quot;TARIFF TRUCE&quot;.            Further Memorandum by the President of the 3oard of Trade.             My colleagues will remember my previous memorandum on this        subject (CP.203(50), and the decision (Cabinet 33(30), Conc.12)        to delay ratification.   I now propose that the Commercial        Convention concluded at Geneva on the 24th torch  this year should        now be ratified, or that I should be authorised to announce at        the Assembly of the League in September that it will be        ratified before the latest date for ratification, that is        November 1st of this year.             If this is not done, our position with reference to the        League of Nations will be exceedingly awkward in  view of the        leading part taken by the British Government in bringing about        this Convention.  I supported the proposal in a speech at the        Assembly last year, and twice attended the Conference at Geneva        in the spring of this year when the Convention was concluded, the        final draft of which I approved.  If the Convention is not        ratified by us it is practioally certain that the forthcoming        negotiations for the reduction of tariffs in Europe will prove        fruitless.  The Convention was intended to prepare the way for        these negotiations and few, if any, countries will ratify if        we fail to do so.  Everything depends upon our ratification.        and at the moment other countries are waiting for our lead.             The risk run by ratifying is exceedingly small.  We        should not be bound beyond the 1st April next year, provided        we gave provisional notice of denunciation the previous February,        I emphasised during the &quot;Conference that it was vital that the        first negotiations regarding the reduction of tariffs should        take place at such a date that they were concluded before the                                    ,  -1- I
1st April, and the continuance of the Convention beyond that date must obviously depend upon the success of the initial negotiations.  It is by no means certain, of course,that a sufficient number of countries will ratify in orderto bring the Convention into force, but in that event if weratify now the onus of destroying the Convention will be upon other countries and not upon us.  Moreover, it should benoted that at any time before the 1st April we can denounce the Convention on giving one month1s notice if any countries who have ratified increase their duties in such a way asto affect our interests seriously.                                   SO. 7. 30.
