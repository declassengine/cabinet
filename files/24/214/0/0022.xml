                    APPBKDXX  I.               WHEAT - QUOTA. COMMITTEE.                Draft Resolutions .                     Who at Quota,       Whilst recognising Its limitations WE RECOMMEND -(l)    The adoption of the principle of tho Quota       Scheme for homo-grown wheat of milling quality       as an cmergoncy measure in view of the vor-y serious       position of arable farming on the condition that it       is accompanied by the estabIIsh.uant of a Wheat Marketing       Board charged with the marketing of quota wheat,(2)    Its operation should be limited to a period cf years       pending .the working out of the full party policy of       an Import Board, the future organisation of which it       would facilitate,,(S)    It should be the duty of the Marketing Board to foster       improved methods of cult.ivo.tion.(4)    There should be an upper limit to the price chargeable       for the wheat of milling quality.(5)    The scheme being based on the Agricultural Marketing       Bill, will thereby contain adequate safeguards for       the consumer.                        II.  Scotland.       We agree in principle that Scottish agrlcuittiro shouldhave a corresponding advantage to that given to Englishagriculture by the Wheat Quota Scheme, and that the Secretary ofSt3.te for Scotland should submit proposals designed to give effectto this principle,                       III.  Announcement of Policy.       We are unanimously of the opinion that it Is necessary
that a full agricultural policy  should he announcedforthwith and embodied in a White Paper.           IV.   ARRYjou11ural Marketing 3111.     We recommend, particularly In view of the strong and united support forthcoming from all sections cfScottish agriculturalists that the agricultural marketing Bill should be formally adopted by theCabinet and introduced in the House of commons before the end of the present Session so as to be printed and in the hands of Members.
     ITcte by.tho First Lord of the Admiralty..       I have grave doubts whether the remedy of the quota system which is proposed to deal with the seriousdecline in the British cultivation of cereals is likelyto be effective having regard to the present and prospective statistical position of world wheat supplies.       Before the Y/ar, Russia exported 20,000,000quarters of wheat and Canada about 12 millions.  To-dayCanada has four times her pre-war exportable surplus,the Argentine is a bigger factory. -Australia hasexpanded her area, and &quot;;uosia is, after many struggles,now definitely in the export market this harvest and likely rapidly to increase,  Eow far therefore a quota system to maintain British production is likely to be effective is extremely problematical.  If, however, theCabinet decide, after consideration cf the political effect of the adoption of the quota, that there is no alternative proposal available, then in my view the quotascheme should be freed from the objections which will beraised, to its being based on the marketing of certificates,etc. and should be of a character which would not pre-judice the consideration and adoption of a wider schemecf Import Boards at a later date.   The composition and functions of the Board now proposed would require themost ocraful consideration, but its powers should besufficient to give real control of the marketing of theBritish crop and to prevent its operations from maintaininginefficient production.  The position of Northern ireland would also have to be made very clear before the scheme
is adopted and prevented from rendering the schemenugatory.                            (Sgda)  A.V. ALEXAMDSR.ou.se of Commons,   25th July, 1930.
