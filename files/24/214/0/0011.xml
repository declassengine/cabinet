I,      At  a Meeting cf the Cabinet on the 26th February,     1930  (Cabinet 12 (30), Conclusion 4), the Cabinet had     bofcre  them a Note by the Permanent  3ecrete,ry to the     Treasury covering a Report (CP, 55  (30)) prepared &quot;by     officials  of the Departments concerned in regard to a     Memorandum on the Economic Consequences of Disarmament     drawn up in November,  1929, by a Joint Committee of the     Parliamentary Labour Party, the General Council cf the     Trade Union Congress and the Executive Committee of the         -.-National Labour Tarty.  This Memorandum v/as upended  to     CP.  55 (30).     2.      At  the request  of the Cabinet the Pirst Lord of the     Admiralty  conferred, vith the Joint Committee on the 4th     March,  1930.    At this conference the Jurat Lord indicated     the general tenor cf the conclusions:; contained in the     Departmental Report while at the same time mailing it clear     that no final decisions  had yet been reached by the     Government on the various feints raised.   In particular  the     position in regard to  naval construction v/as explained and     the J-iint  Committee \.ero rained that the actual diminution     in new  construction and  re-pair \/ork uhioh might be expected     to result  from the Government&apos; o Disarmament policy &quot;v/as     unlikely to be as great  as they might have been led to suppose.     Attention  vas also dravn to the difficulties involved In
 certain of the Joint Committee-1 s proposals, as for example s the revival of the Trade facilities Scheme. 3o     On the 2Gth March, 1900 (Cabiiipt 17 (30) Conclusion 6), the Cabinet- considered a letter addressed to the Prime Minister (CP, 106 (30) by the Joint Committee, in which, after an expression of dissatisfaction and disagreement vith the conclusions in the Departmental Report, emphasis vaslaid on tho desirability of reviving the trade facilities scheme in the interests cf the shipbuilding and engineering industries and of drastic revision of the expert credits scheme v/ith a view to stimulating trade v ith Russia. 4.     In accordance \.;ith the wishes of the Joint Committee, the Cabinet agreed that tho Secretary of State for &apos;.-/ar, the First Lord of tho -admiralty and tho President cf the Board of Trade, should form a Committee to meet tho Joint Committee in order to hear ..hat they might have to say, and to give-them explanations as tc/the policy of the Government in this mattora                       REPORT^ 5.     v/e have held L&apos; nee tings vith the Joint Committee, in the course of which tho representations contained  in the Joint Committee1 s original ..iemcrandum and in further -ieincranda. supjilied to us by that Corcmittee have boen fully examined and discussed,. 6.     During those discussions &quot;.. e have thought it desirable again to.impress upon tho Joint Committee -      (i) that, so far as can be foreseen,          there is no likelihood cf a reduction          in the next few years of naval          construction on anything like the          scale which has been  suggested;
             (ii)  that  the  effect  of such reductions  ac  may  be                  made,  \.hen spread  over the  vast  employment                  area,  is  insignificant, and,           &apos; (-iid-)  that  such unemployment as is  mainly                  attributable to  reduced naval construction,                  constitutes only a very small part  of  the                  goneral unemployment problem,,        7.      It  KILL  bo remembered that the Joint  Committee        suggested  in  their  Memorandum certain measures  of alleviation        which fall under the following heads:-             (1) Preference under  Colonial Development                Grant  procedure should be given to                districts  affected  by disarmament;             (2) Trade  with Russia should be  stimulated  by                means  of Export Credits and  Trade facilities                schemes.             (3) ,jale of old British tonnage  to foreigners                should be  prevented;             (4) Royal  dockyards should be made free to                compete with private firms xor merchant                shipbuilding;             (5) The  Trade  facilities ACT should be  re-                introduced ;             (6) Monetary compensation should be paid to                work-people thro\.n out of work by                disarmament; such compensation to apply.                to outside firms  as WELL as t o the                Government establishments, and to be                retrospective.)ColondalBc      In our  Conferences : ith the Joint CommitteeDevelop^ment   &quot;&quot;&quot;-^P reference has been made  to the first of  these suggestions,Grantf ro&quot;ce- &quot;viz. ,  that preference under the Colonial Development  Grantdure,-Brefer-    Procedure should be -given to districts affected  byence.            disarmament.   It will,  be remembered that in para. 18            of their Memorandum the Joint Committoe themselves            expressed doubts as to practical value of this suggestion            and \.e assume that they appreciate the grave difficulties            to which the proposal would give rise and vhich are set            out in paragraph 16 of CP. 55 (30).            9.     v/e cannot recommend the Cabinet to entertain            this suggestion.2)Export    lo.     i-V-G have discussed with the Joint Committee various Credits            aspects of the question of stimulating trade vith Russia            by means of the Export Credits Guarantee  Scheme  which  was
extended to cover business with that  country in August1929.  We have pointed out that the guarantees  given  inrespect of exports to Russia have in  the aggregatecovered goods to the value of over  3,700,000 and that since last October (by which time advantage was beginning to be taken of the new facilities for Russia) the  amountof business done under the scheme with that country-has exceeded the amount done with all other countries.The Joint Committee have represented to &quot;as that very-largo orders for British goods could bo placed withRussia if the Export Credits Advisory Committee would agree to give the guarantees on easier terms than hereto-fore, for example, in the case of certain largo steelorders it has been suggested to us that the guarantee should extend to 75 per cent0 of the value instead of60 per cento11.     Wo have explained to the Joint Committee theworking of tho Export Credits schemo and tho reasonsfor  requiring the exporter to take an appropriate part ofthe  risk, and have pointed out (1) that the AdvisoryCommittee can only consider actual concrete proposals submitted to them in the proper manner; (2)  that it wouldbe quite out of the question for Hol!0 Government or forthe  Advisory Committee to give any kind of undertaking in advance regarding the amount of credit which could be guaranteed in these Russian casca, and.  (5) that thelarge  orders which it is alleged could bo placed never,in fact, materialise in the form of  .&apos;. definite contractswhich  can be laid before tho Advisory Gommittee.  Wehave also warned the tloint Committee against beingmisled by propaganda and the statements of interested parties.
               V/8  are  agreed that  the  Export  Credits  Scheme  should          not  be used  for  the purpose  of  encouraging  speculative and          unsound  propositions;  we recognise that  the  amount  of          trade which,  in  present  circumstances,  can  possibly  be          carried  on between this  country end Russia  has  been          exaggerated  and  that the question of Russian  credji^S          cannot be  disassociated  from the other  major  financial          questions  which  are to be the subject of  negotiations with          the  Soviet Government.    At  the same time we  are  impressed          by the need,  which becomes daily more urgent, of  stimulating          our  export trade and we  feel that in the  present          emergency  it  might be  justifiable to take risks which in          normal circumstances it  would net be necessary  or  desirable          to incur.   We think that it might  be found possible to          ease in  certain  respects the conditions of  the  Export          Credits  Scheme without prejudice to the principles on          which that scheme is based and we suggest that  the Chancellor          of the Exchequer should  be invited to give  this proposal          his  sympathetic  consideration,          12.   The  Joint  Committee have  now agreed to  arrange for          the  submission to the  Advisory  Committee  of a definite          proposal covering some section  of the large steel  orders          referred to  above,  in order  that the needs  of the  Advisory          Committee  may be definitely  ascertained.  Pending  the          result of  this  &apos;test&apos;  case,  we  make no  recommendation in          regard to  this proposal.1  Obsolete  13.  In  the course of  examination of  the  Joint Committee&apos;s  Tonnage          scheme for scrapping obsolete mercantile  tonnage we  have          pointed,  out that legislation would  be required before the          sale of  old tonnage  to foreigners could be  prohibited and                                  - 5  -
that other grave obstacles such a.s the provisions in theAnglo German Commercial Treaty and those of the international convention dealing with import and export prohibitions wouldhave to be overcome.   The scrapping of old tonnage wouldmean that foreigners would buy old foreign instead of oldBrit-ioh ships and British shipowners would lose a valuableforeign market for their old tonnage from the proceeds of sale of which they are now enabled to build new tonnage.     The proposal under consideration has also been strongly commended to us from the point of view ofexjediting the modernising of the British Mercantile Marineso as to enable full advantage to be taken of the up-to-date dock equipment at British pcrfs,:.   It has been represented to uo that it is doubtful whether at the presenttime the facilities at the British ports are being used upto 33-*?.,- of their efficiency., and  it has been pointed&apos; outthat all over the world modern dock appliances are beinginstalled and that full advantage of all this new development can only be secured if there is an extensivereplacement of the older British  mercantile tonnage bymodern vessels which can cake the fullest and most economicuse of the new equipment.   It has further been suggested to us that the economies which would result, if effect wasgiver to the proposal, would enable the British MercantileMarine to secure a. larger share of the world&apos;s carryingtrade than it can hope to do in the absence of a scheme ofthis character. .     The answer to these contentions will be found in thesection r:Cld British Tonnage&quot; on  pe.ges 7-9 of CF.55(30).It may, however, be noted 6hat the proportion of the tonnageowned by the United Kingdom, the  U.C.M., Italy and germany which is under 10 years old is as follows:-
United Kingdom        47.BU.3.A.                37.6Italy                 37.8Germany               6414.    We have agreed that the whole question ofthe disposal of obsolete tonnage should be referredto a Committee appointed by the President of theBoard of Trade consisting of two representatives ofthe shipowners end two representatives of the TradeUnions concerned with an independent Chairman:every effort will be made to expedite the Committee&apos;swo rk.       ho further action is required preceding thereceipt of the Report of this Committee.Royal Beck- ID. With regard to proposal ho.(4) vis,, that theyardsana      Royal dockyards should be made free to compete rathMerchantShipbuild- private firms for merchant shipbuilding, the Jointing.         Committee were informed by tne first Lord on the         4th March last that the Admiralty were willing to         undertake the maximum amount of &quot;repayment&quot; work
     that was possible, &quot;but that apart from other serious     objections, they could not contemplate the huge     capital expenditure in the Royal dockyards which     would be necessary to fit them to enter into     competition with the Contract yards,,16,  In their conferences with us the Joint Committee have     not seriously pressed this suggestion.   In this     connection we would remind the Cabinet that the whole     question of alternative work in the Government     Establishments has recently been considered by an     Inter-Departmental Committee under the Chairmanship of     the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury,  (CP. 149(30)) .     The Report of this Committee which was taken note of     by the Cabinet on May 14th.  1930,  (Cabinet 27 (30)     Conclusion 7), mentions that even taking  account of     the reductions in the Naval Estimates  for 1930 there     is sufficient Naval work to keep the  existing work     people economically employed at least  for the next     twelve months and that in the very special circumstances     at Gibraltar dockyard repair work on merchant ships     is to be undertaken there as an experimental arrangement.17.   One inevitable result, of adopting the  Joint Committee&apos;s     proposal would, be the placing in the Royal dockyards of     orders which would otherwise have gone to the private     firms.   There would, immediately be strong complaints     from the shipbuilding and repairing areas that the heavy     unemployment in those areas was being  increased as a     result of the Government1s action in attracting work     to their own establishments.10.   We&apos; recommend that no action on this suggestion should
bo taken beyond coianrvmicating to - the JointCommittee the position as stated at the close of paragraph 13*The Joint Committee have refrained from pressing for the re-introduction of theTrade Facilities Scheme (No. 5) for generalpur-pesos,It is reasonable to suppose that the arguments against any such policy(see pages 10-12) of CP.  55(30) haveconvinced them of the inexpediency of this form of relief.The Joint Committee have however suppliedus with a Memorandum (see Appendix I) urging that the trade Facilities Scheme should be revived in the special interests of the shipbuilding industry.   It is alleged that pledges were given at the GeneralElection in favour of the proposal.,   Inreply to the suggestion that the industryis inefficient ft is pointed out thatGreat britain has been able slightly to improveher position notwithstanding the artificialstimulants given by her foreign competitorsto encourage local ship building.    emphasis is laid on the heavy unemployment  in theindustry and on the need to secure allpossible orders.
 81.As pointed out in CP. 55(30) paragraph G, proposals    for helping shipbuilding by Trade Facilities or other    methods are based on the fallacy that more&apos; ships are    required in the carrying trade whereas in fact there are    more ships than can be economically employed.22t In this connection it may be noted that according  to the    latest figures issued by the Chamber of Shipping,    approximately 1,500,000 tons of British shipping were    1aid-up in the United Kingdom on the lot July, 1930, or    approximately 7.4.per cent of the total net tonnage  of    vessels registered under Part I of the Merchant Shipping    Act 1894, at ports of the United Kingdom.    Great Britsin is, however, not the only country  affected.    There are no complete figures of idle world tonnage, but  it    has been estimated that there are over 4-g- million  tons    gross 1aid-up in  different parts of  the world.   In Norway,     to take one example, it is  reported that the  laid-up    shipping amounted to 303 .,000 tons dead weight.   In    relation to the sise of the Norwegian Mercantile Marine    this proportion of iaid-up tonnage is considerably greater    than in our own case. 23.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained to  the Joint    Committee on July 24th that  there  could be  no  question  of    re-introducing Trade Facilities for  the benefit  of the    shipbuilding industry at a time when there  were  approximate--    ly 1,500,000 tons of shipping  laid up  in  this  country  alone,    particularly in view of the  bitter hostility  to  the  revival    of  the scheme of  the shipowners, who were  in  the habit  of    attributing  some, at any rate,  of  their  troubles  to  its    operation in  the  past.  The  Chancellor promised  to discuss    the  question again with the  Joint Committee in the event    of  material  changes  of the existing  circumstances  of the    indutry and the opinions of  the shipowners.    The Joint Committee appeared to acquiesce  in  the position    as  propounded by  the Chancellor of the Exchequer.                 _10._         ________-&quot;&apos;&quot; &quot;J -&quot;&quot;minimum BII niMniinnMMiMMMMiiiWMWnWIWHil^^              M&apos;  &quot;^TftiSSS
tiorK. . .24,At. our  request  the  Joint Committee have elaborated            the arguments sot  out  in paragraph 13 of their            original memorandum in a further memorandum a. copy            of which is  attached (Appendix 11).       25.   We entirely  agree with the  opening statement of            this second  Memorandum that  &quot;it is of paramount            importance that no  effort should be  spared and no            avenue  unexplored  to substitute productive work            for work upon armaments.  The payment of compensation            should  be regarded  as  a last resource, after all            other efforts have  failed.&quot;        26.  Under this head the Joint Committee  make two main            proposals - years&apos;         (&amp;)  Government  &quot;established1 employees retired                   on pensions  should &quot;re allowed 1 added years1 ,                   under adequate  safeguards, so as to give                   them  the same pensions that they would have                   earned had  they remained in the employment                   of the State until, reaching the age of 60.        27.  The following arguments have been advanced in            support of this proposal (l) it would facilitate            the retirement  of  the  older  men (11) the principle            of paying compensation for  loss of office, has been            sanctioned by Parliament in  the Ministry of Trans-            port Act 1919 the  Railway1s  Act 1921 and the Elec-            tricity Supply  Act of  1927  (111) the Treasury have            power to allow  1 added  years1 in the  case of estab-            lished  employees who entered the service before            1909 and should be  empowered to award compensation            on a similar basis to  those  who entered after 1909            and also to  1unestablished1  employees who are not            entitled to  pension rights.        28.  Our objections  to  this proposal may  be briefly
 summarised as follows&apos; - As will be seen from the Note  by  the Treasury  (Appendix 111) 1 added years1 could not be given in the case of post 1903 en- trsnts without legislation (and legislation is obviously out of  the question).  Per many years prior to 1.909 it  had been the practice of the Treasury, adopted at  the express instance of Parliament to decline to grant &quot;added years&quot; and this practice hap. been continued ever since. To revert to the  practice of 40 years ago in the case  of pre 1909  entrants without the prior sanction of Parliament would be clearly unconstitutional and improper.  Apart however from difficulties of this kind we think that the proposal raises avery  important question of principle.   Its a&amp;op- tioa  would involve the grant to certain individuals and groups of work-people of valuable  privilegesnot open to other comparable Government employeesworking under precisely similar terms  and conditions.It is admitted that the power to give  3added years1resulted in charges of favouritism and other graveabuses which evoked acute Parliamentary criticism and led to the discontinuance of the practice.Yet the Joint Committee ere in effect  asking thatthe system should now be
              revived, in order that it may be used in the  manner              which gave rise to so much scandal and criticism in              the past.    In our view it would be impossible  for  any              Government to adopt a policy which would differentiate              in this manner between one employee and another, no              scheme could be devised which would work; without giving              rise to friction, abuse and discontent and we think              that public opinion would vigorously resent  any such              attempt to give preferential treatment to a particular              class and would support tho considered judgment of              Parliament that the G-government owes the same duty in              this respect to all Government employees alike.,              irrespective of the cause to which the loss  of their              employment may be due.SING 03?       29.     The Joint Committee&apos;s second coiapensatcryABLISEMSUTSi SPECIAL      proposal is -UTS.                  (b) That in cases whore a shipyard or factory -                    whether under Government or private ownership -                    is closed through the progress of disarmament,                    the  compensation should take the form of grants                    tf&quot; the local Authority for tho purpose of                    financing work schemes for tho workpeople                    affected.   These grants should be additional                    to tho usual grants given for approved schemes                    of work, and should vary according to  the numbers                    of workpeople displaced, their chances Of                    obtaining work in the district, etc-                      The Joint Committee also advocate the applica-.                    ticn of this procedure in cases where, owing  to                    diminution of armaments, discharges of                    considerable bodies of workpeople are  involved,                    although the actual closing down of the                    establishments is not entailed.
30.      Re attach Appendix XV.  a memorandum by theMinistry of Labour on the proposal,  nith the conclusionsof which re are informed the minister of Labour is inful1 agreement.51.,      We see great objection to the suggestion that within the area of particular Local Authorities a classof unemployed workpeople should be given exceptionalpreferential treatment in regard to relief works.   Realso think that in practice it would be almost impossibleto justify differentiating between the unemploymentcaused by disarmament or the rationalisation of armamentssupply, and unemployment clue to other causes.   Wodoubt, moreover,  whether it would bo found possible inpractice to organise special relief works on the lines suggested.32,      The conclusions which we have reached on thevarious proposals of the Joint Committee may besummarised as follows:-         (I) We cannot recommend the Cabinet to             entertain the suggestion that preference             under the Colonial Development Grant             procedure should be given to districts             affected by the Disarmament policy.             (Par agr aph 3),         (2) Farther action with regard to the             proposal for stimulating trade with             Russia must aws.it the result of the             test case to be submitted to the             Export Credits  Advisory Committee,             Re suggest that the Chancellor of the             Exchequer should be invited to give             sympathetic consideration to a suggestion             that the conditions of the Scheme should             bo re-examined.  (Paragraph II).         (3) No further action Is required regarding             the proposal that the sale of old             British tonnage to foreigners should be             prevented pending the Report of the Board             of Trade Committee.  (Paragraph, SS).
(4)  The present position with regard to    &quot;ereliant Shipping in the Royal  Dockyards    as indicated in paragraph 10  might he    communicated to the Joint Committees    (Paragraph 18).(5)  The Chancellor of the Exchequer has  recently    informed a Deputation from the  Trade Union    Congress General Council that Trade  Facilities    cannot be revived for shipbuilding but that    if&apos;the circumstances alter tho  question will    be reexamihod.

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.                 JOINT DISAmiJftaaiT COlllITTEE,               Trade Facilities - Shirbuilding.      The re-introduction of the Trade Facilities Act was an election pledge of both the Labour and Liberal Parties at the last General Election.      Since then, however, Mr. Snowden and I r. Thomas have refused to honour this pledge upon the grounds that they cannot agree to use public money to subsidise inefficient management, and thus stave off the re-organisation cf industry which has first to take place,      This raises the question &quot;Is the British Shipbuilding industry inefficient?&quot;      With the exception cf the United States, wage rates In the industry are higher in this country than in any other competing countr-&quot;, yet upon a costing basis this country builds more cheaply than any other.   But other countries have State Credit Facilities which allow them to lend money at gilt-edged rates, or less, and also to extend credits over a period of years,      France has the Credit Maritime, by which shipbuilders are leaned money at Zfi for cargo vessels and 5y.j for liners- In November last, 11. Rcllin, Minister of Merchant Marine instructed the National Economic Council (Conseil National Economique; to enquire into the industry/.   As a result of investigation in other countries, the Council reported that British costs were approximately 25p&quot; lower than French building costs.   1.1. Roll in was advised that further State assistance was necessary  in order to make good the difference between French and foreign shipbuilding prices.      Italy.  The Italian Government pays a subsidy of 120 lire (approximately 26&apos;/-) per ton upon shipbuilding                            -1-D.C. 9/4/1929-30.
materials purchased in Italy and 55 lire  (approximately12/-) per ten gross upon vessels built with  anadditional subsidy for engines and&apos;boilers based upon their horse power-   In addition,  Italian-builtvessels are exempted from  Income Tax for  the first six years of their working.     According to &quot;The Times&quot;  (19/6/30) thesesubsidies are to be increased  hy 33^,  and   the period  of exemption from Income Tax  extended from 6 years to  10years.   Germany.  In 1925, the  German Reich voted the sunof 50 million marks ( 2,500,000) to be placed at thedisposal of shipbuilding firms at  an average of 2-g-/- belowthe Reichsbank rate-   This was exhausted in 12 months,and a fux-ther annual amount of 3 million  narks  ( 150,000)was voted for six years.   This total  of  60  million marksis spread over five years  under the following conditions:     Loans are granted up  to 5Q)o of the cost of construction and may be renewed after five  years.   Interest charged at\cj0 during the period of construction,  4p  for the first year of delivery, but in no case is the rate to exceedl;i less than the Reichsbank rate.     In addition special tariffs exist for railconveyance of materials to shipbuilding and  repairingy&amp;rds  at 3G-35fp belcvv commercial  rates -   Other Stateaction includes a grant of  100,000 by the State  .ofHamburg towards shipbuilding loans in  1926.   The PrussianState saved the Vulkan Company  (Stettin)  in  1926 by a loan of  400,000,   To avert the closing  of  theSchlchau Werke at Elbing end Danzig the Reichsrat lastyear approved of a subsidy of  24 million  marks  ( 1,200,COC)and an annual subsidy of 2,3 million marks ( 115 ,000)
     A further &quot;windfall&apos;- has recently fallen to german shipping.   For several 3rears a mixed German-AmericanClaims Commission has been engaged in the task ofassessing the compensation to he paid to the german shipping companies for the use Of shipping seised duringthe war by the American Navy.    The sum ofapproximately7&quot;  15 millions has now been awarded.     United States-  The Jones-White Act, passed inMarch 1987, places a sum of 125 million dollars(approximately  25 millions) at the disposal of theUnited States Shipping Board.   This fund is a&quot;revolving&quot; one, i.e. the repayments made upon loans fromthe fund are returned to it for further use.   Its use is defined by Sec. II (a) of the Act which says:-     &quot;The Board may use such fund to the extent it     thinks proper, upon such terms as the Board may     prescribe in making.loans to persons , citizens     of the United States, in the construction by them     in private shipyards or in Eavy Yards in the United     States, of vessels of the best and most efficient     type,&quot; etc.      Varying rates of interest are charged . but theusual rate is Zjo.

The fact that this country is ableslightly to improve its position in the internationalshipbuilding industry in spite of the artificialstimulants given to its competitors is one proof of the
 efficiency of the  industry.   That a delegation of German  shipyard workers was sent to tour the ship- building areas last autumn to discover how our people could receive higher wages and yet beat the German prices is another, while  the formation of the national Ship- builders&apos; Security Ltd. is a third.     This Company  was formed in February last in order to (a)  eliminate redundant shipyards (b) secure more economical working through concentration of production. It is claimed that in view of these facts  the reason for the withholding of Trade Facilities i.e. subsidising inefficiency cannot be sustained.     The slump in world freights has resulted in a slump in shipbuilding orders.   The Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation recently reported that 69^ of their firms had not received a single order during January, 84^o did not get an order during February and SOya did not obtain fin order during IIarch.   A large pro- portion of the 1,614,000 tons of shipping then building in this country was in the completion stages and the absence of new orders made the position glooms&apos;- in the extreme.     The Ministry  of Labour Gazette for June records a percentage of unemployment for the Industry of 28.4 for May,an increase cf 1.2^ over April and 5:*5)1 ever May 1929.     The urgent need to secure all possible orders is therefore apparent, as the position is otherwise certain to become very much worse.

You will remember that at tho last  interview between members of the Cabinet Committee and the disarmament committee, Mr, Shaw, the Chairman, asked for more detailed information regarding the proposed compensation  to work-people displaced.     I now enclose for the information of  the  CabinetCommittee a memorandum which my Committee  instructs me  to forward to you dealing in greater detail with  the abovemattero   I shall be glad to hear from you at  your ear-liest convenience what Is likely to be the most  suitabledote for another meeting with the Cabinet  Committee.r Ref.H/578.TRANSPORT HOUSE (SOUTH BLOCK) SMITH SQUARE, LONDON, S.W.1.artment.search.29th May, 1930.Yours faithfully,Secretary, Disarmament Committee0Enclosure:Memorandum.
PRIVATE AND C0KFID7JNTIALv               JOINT DISARMAMENT COMMITTEE.            COMPENSATION TO DISPLACED WORKPEOPLE.     The Disarmament Committee outlined  its policy regarding compensation for workpeople displaced byDisarmament in some detail in the Memorandum  sent tothe Cabinet in December last, the subject occupyingnearly 3? pages.     It was clearly pointed out that the Committeedesired that monetary compensation should be  regardedas the last resource, only to be taken when all efforts to find alternative employment had failed, in thefollowing words:-     &quot;It should however be stressed that no compensationthat is likely to be paid can fully compensate for theloss of employment^ -either from a personal or a civicpoint of view.   The closing of a factory or  a shipyardwith compensation to the workers dismissed is a severeblow to the industrial life of a town, militating againstthe opportunities of young people to enter careers, and ifas is often the case, the yard or factory in  question isthe chief source of employment for the locality., it means the swift decay of a town or district.   It istherefore of paramount importance that no effort shouldbe spared and no avenue unexplored to substitute pro-duct ive work for work upon armaments.   The payment ofcompensation should be regarded as a last resource, after all other efforts have failed.&quot;      The memorandum also pointed out that the principleof compensation for loss of employment due to the acts of the Executive had been admitted in the Ministry ofTransport Act (1919) the Railways Act 1321,, the
Electricity  (Supply) Act of 1927 as well as in the oldLocal Government Acts.   It could be added that severalindustries pay compensation to workers dis.laced throughpolicy  (i.e. amalgamations, rationalisation etc.) thelatest  instance of this being the Gas and Fuel Industry.     At the  meeting between the Cabinet Committee  (P,t.Hon.T. Shaw, I.:.?., Rt. Hon. A.V. Alexander,       and  Mr. G,Gillett, P.P.) and the Disarmament  Committee held on  MaySth, Mr-. Shaw did not dissent from  the principle ofcompensation, but stated that more  detailed proposals wouldhave to be submitted before any definite  reply could  begiven.   He  Instanced the  difficult&quot; of disentanglingdischarges due to disarmament from  discharges due  tofluctuation  of commercial  orders in establishments under-taking  beth  classes of work.   Tho  Disarmament committee therefore has again discussed the  problem and tho  additionaldetails are  given below.     The workpeople likely to be affected  can &quot;be dividedinto three main groups  (a) Government  employees  (b)private employees in  a shipyard  cr  factory entirelydependent upon Government  orde\&apos;3  (a) private employees in a shipyard cr factory  undertaking mixed Governmentand c omme r c ia 1 o rde r-s .G over nrm v. t Emp 1 oy e o s .     Regarding: Government  employees, the  whole  position was adequate 1&quot; covered in  the original  Memorandum,  whenit was  suggested that  compensation should be  paid  byreviving the practice  of  &quot;adding  years&quot;  to a  workman&apos;service - under adequate  safeguards.   The furthersuggestion was :::-ade  that  the  number of  year3  added wouldbe balanced  between  their  ages  at  the  time of  discharge
and tho normal age of retirement (60 years).^^LG-G2z2J?AV^..2JL Sstablishmentg .     In cases where a shipyard or factory - whether under government or private ownership - is closed down throughthe progress of disarmament, we consider that thecompensation should take the form of grants to theLord Authority for the purpose of financing work schemesfor the workpeople affected.   These grants should be additional to the usual grants given for approved schemesof work, and should vary according  to  the numbers of work people displaced, their  chances of obtaining work  inthe district, etc.     Local circumstances vary  so greatly that  it isdifficult  to draw up a rigid scheme.    But  take aconcrete illustration.   When  the Admiralty closedRosyth  and. Pembroke Dockyards, the  official statement was made that  220,000 per year would  be saved.As the  towns concerned  (Rosyth and  Pembroke-) dependedentirely upon these Dockyards, and  were in  fact &quot;builtbecause the  Dockyards were  created,  the Committeeconsiders  that the action  that the  Government  of that day should have taken  would  have been  to hand  overthe sites  -  or a  portion of  them -  to  the  localauthorities  with  a sum of  money  sufficient  to  equip  -or partially equip -- the two  ports  for commercial work.Major Eeductions  in  Personnel.     In our  opinion, this  is  also  tho  method  ofcompensation that  should be  adopted if the  diminution of armaments result  in discharges  of  considerablebodies  of  workpeople without&apos; entailing the  closing downor the  yards or factories.    In  this  case,  also, the
amounts paid to local authorities should depend uponthe numbers of -workpeople affected, their ages, thepossibility of work in the district, etc  We considerthat the details of each local scheme should be settled by a local Committee representing the interests concerned(Local Authority, Trade Union etc) and. should be sent tothe appropriate Ministry for sanction.         v/e outline later in this Memorandum our proposals in cases of conflicting estimates regarding the amount ofcompensation payable and also the selection cf individualswhere individual compensation is paid.Individual Compensation.         In the case of..individual compensation, theprocedure laid down by one or other of the Acts mentionedabove should be followed.  The Ministry of Transport Act(1919) states -         &quot;Any officer or servant  ,, ,,.0\&apos;mo suffers any direct pecuniary loss in consequence of this Act.......shall be entitled to be paid by the Minister, compensationfor such pecuniary loss.&quot;   The amount is to be assessed by the Treasury with the right of appeal to arbitration.The Electricity (S\ipply) Act of 3.927 lays it down that compensation is to be awarded by  referees appointed by theMinister of Labour.   The administration of individualcompensation should be entrusted  either to a local jointCommittee representative of the interests concerned or to thelocal Public Assistance Committee.   In practice it will befound that each case will have to be taken on its merits.In some cases it will probably take the form of payment of rail fares and removal expenses to another area, in other cases weekly payments, etc.                           4.
Assessment of Compensation.      If any difficulties arise in assessing the amount ofcompensation to he paid either to a Local Authority or to individuals, we suggest that a referee shall &quot;be appointedby the Minister of Labour who shall decide upon the factsplaced before him, snd award accordingly,      There remains the difficult case, where workpeople are engaged in a yard or factory which undertakes both armament and commercial orders.  The difficulty of deciding whatdischarges are due to disarmament and what to cessation orcompletion of commercial work is a real one, but should no.t bemade the excuse for withholding compensation altogether..  Inthese cases, the following procedure is proposed:       It shall be the duty of any employer of labour wherethe employment depends in part upon Government orders tocertify that the loss of such orders or the curtailment ofthem, has caused a reduction in the numbers of workpeopleemployed, and to supply the Government Department concernedwith the names of the workpeople affected.  If the department concerned admits the accuracy of the claim, tne question ofcompensation to the individual workpeople is to be negotiatedwith reference to arbitration in case of dispute.       If, on the other hand, the Department concernedrefuses liability in the matter, the question of liabilitjris to be brought before a referee appointed &quot;by the Ministerof Labour, who will decide the matter.EPH/NW/553.

Established .CJYJ1 Servants -                 Section 7 of tho Superannuation Act 1859 empowered       the Treasury.to allow &quot;added years&quot; for the purpose of       coE.pu.ting compensation: allowances awarded cn abolition of       office.                 The power so conferred on the Treasury provoked       severe Parliamentary criticism and In 1888 the Government       gave  a pledge to Parliament that in future &quot;added years&quot;       would not be allowed except in very special circumstances.       It thus  became tho general and ultimately the invariable       practice of the Treasury to assess compensation awards on the       same  basis as invalidity pensions i .e. without any addition       of years of service.                 Section 6 of the Superannuation Act 1909 made It       illegal  to allow added years in tho case of new entrants       to tho service:  and by a proviso to tho Section it was                       &apos;&apos;&apos;i,:&apos;s;PdPMIHHMHHIWHMHWBVRllHHH^::&apos; -       prescribed that nothing therein contained was to &quot;affect the       &quot;application of Section 7. of the Superannuation Act 1859       &quot;to persons already in tho service &quot;orthe practice of the      &quot;S,i  .asilrZ jihe^rounder &quot;*                 As already stated, the practice of the Treasury
was at that time in no circumstances to grant added, years andthis has continued to be their practice over since .          It may be that legally it is still within thecompetence of the Treasury under the terms of the previse to section 6 of the Act of I9C9 to revert to their old practiceof &quot;added years&quot; so far as pre-1909 entrants ts the CivilService might be concerned.   But seeing that the practice inforce in 1909 had been adopted by the Treasury at the instanceof Parliament and that the intention of&apos;the proviso referredto was to provide for the continuance of existing practice,it would clearly be unconstitutional to adopt such a coursewithout the prior approval of Parliament.          B-   Cnostablished Civil Servants.          Under Section 4 cf the Superannuation Act 1887unestablished Civil Servants are eligible for the award of gatuities on abolition of office after a minimum period of  years&apos; service.   Gratuities payable under this Sectionmay not exceed a week&apos;s pay for each year of service:  and theaward is in all eases calculated on actual length of servicewithout added years .Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,      July 10th, 1930 .

Circulated in pursuance          of E.D.C*(30) 5th Meeting, Minutes  VI.    1*     The proposal is  that where a shipyard or factory is    closed down as a result of disarmament policy , special grants    supplementary to the normal grants payable for relief works,    should be paid to the  Local Authority to finance schemes for    the men displaced by the closing of the shipyard or factory,    2.     There is no town the whole of the Insured population of    which is physically dependent upon any particular shipyard or    factory.  To create special relief works for the men discharged    from the shipyard or factory means therefore creating within the    Loc a I Author 11y&apos;s are a  a preferential class of workpeople.    3..     Apart from the  Royal Dockyards, there is no shipyard    wholly devoted to Admiralty work.   If it is unsuccessful  In    obtaining alternative  employment is that to be treated as  the    result of disarmament  policy?   For a long time Vickers at  arrow    depended mainly upon naval work, but when it became clear  that    naval work would not be forthcoming they turned their attention    to  liner work and have  been successful competitors.   John Brown&quot;    another predominantly naval firm, have secured the order for the    Cunarder.               -  -
4,     The  same argument holds good of most  commercial worksother than  shipyards which  in the past have  depended mainly uponarmament orders.   The River Don Works at Sheffield are best.suited for-  heavy  armoupplating, but they are  capable of other classes of  work.     It would not be in the interests of the  firm, the LocalAuthority cr the  workpeople,  to assume that  when a private yardor factory  ceases to obtain its usual orders  for armament theonly thing  open to Its workpeople Is relief  work.5.     The  case of the Royal Dockyards and such works as  theSmall Arms  Works  at Hnfield, or even Woolwich Arsenal is rather different.   As things are  it is Imorobable  that eofr. Pembroke orSheerness Dockyard will be  fully  utilised by private firms, butthere Is little ground in equity for a distinctive treatment  cfthe unemployment  caused by  the closing of those two yards andthe unemployment  caused e..g, by the closing  of a colliery underthe comoulsorv amalgamation orooosals of the  Coal Bin.6.     It is in practice extremely difficult  to suggest workablegrounds for differentiating between the unemployment caused bydlsarmamrnt or the rationalisation of armament supply, and.unemployment due  to other causes.   If there  is a case fordifferentiation at all it may lie in regard  to the directemployees of Government armament establishments but if so itseems more aporopriatalyja matter to be settled by the Departmentwhose employees the displaced workmen have been.Ministry of Labour.   7th July. 1930,
