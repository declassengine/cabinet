   [This Document is  the  Property of His  Britannic Majesty &apos;s Government, j                      Printed -for the  Cabinet.   July 1930.SECRET.CP.  273 (30).                                  CABINET.The Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance.Question of continuance, whether permanently, by  an Act,  or for short periods.    - -MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.   The Cabinet will remember that on 25th  March last a Bill was  introduced,  and rapidly passed, in the Bengal Legislative Council, to amend the Bengal Criminal law amendment Act, 1925, which was due to lapse on 23rd April at the expiry of its fiveyears&apos; term. The effect of the amendment was to continue for five more years the  first part of the Act, providing for trial  by special procedure, and to repeal the second part which  sanctioned  the imprisonment without trial of  certain classes of offendersconcerned in terroristic conspiracy.   At the introduction of the  amending Bill it was made clear by the Governor  thatin the event of the  recurrence of conditions such as led to the original Ordinance of1921 (which became the Act of 1925), Government would  not  hesitate  to restore, byOrdinance, the powers lapsing by the repeal of the second part of the Act of 1925.   On the night of  18th/19th April there occurred the anarchical outrage at Chittagongin Eastern Bengal,  when an  armed attack was made on the railway  and arsenal, thesentries beiDg surprised and murdered by a terrorist gang.   On I9th April  the Governor-General promulgated  an Ordinance  restoring thelapsed powers of summary arrest  and imprisonment without  trial.  This Ordinanceexpires at the  end of six months, on 18th October.   I circulate  now, for the information of my colleagues, a copy of a telegram dated21st July 1930, from the Government  of India, summarising a proposal made by the bengal Government to introduce a Bill to  continue in force,  without time limit, thefull provisions of the  Act  cf 1925; and  a copy  of a  telegram  which I addressed,in reply, to the Government of India, on 25th  July, pointing out certain objections which  I saw in the  course proposed, and making the- counter-suggestion to  continuethe present  Ordinance  by the use of the  Governor-Generals  emergency powersof action by Ordinance, which, however,  is only effective  for six months on each occasion of use.   My telegram crossed the Government of India&apos;s statement of their views containedin the long telegram  of 25th July, No. 2388  S.  Their view is, in brief,  that theexisting Ordinance  should be replaced by legislation  and that such legislation shouldbe permanent, without limitation  of time,  though (para. 8) they would be prepared,if it Avould ease the  passage of the Bill, to accept an amendment limiting the operationof the proposed measure to  a period of  not  less than ten years.  As was the case withthe Act of 1925, supplementary legislation by the Central Legislature will  probablybe required.   A further  telegram from the Government  of India, in direct reply to mine of the25th is also appended.   It will be observed that the matter is very urgent.   The Bengal Government need to give  notice of  the Bill,  if the introduction  of it is  authorised, not later than31st July.  This  means  that orders  must  issue, by telegram, not later than  the earlyafternoon of Wednesday, 30th Julv.                                                                        W.  B.    28th July  1930. Telegram from Government of India to Secretary of State for India, 21st Jidy 1930.   23(30 S.  Bengal Government have addressed us regarding replacement of BengalCriminal Law Amendment  Ordinance,  1930, by  permanent  legislation,  which they wish to introduce in session  of Legislative Council commencing 11th August.   Inorder to enable required notice  to  be given, it  will be necessary  to inform LocalGovernment of oxiv decision not later than 31st July.  We propose to consider matter     4672    75  7.30
at very early date and will then inform you of our views.   In the meantime vve nowcommunicate  for  your information  scope of proposals and arguments  in  supportthereof as given by Local Government.    2. The Uill reproduces  Ordinance  with addition, of proviso that corresponding-proviso in section 11 (1) of  Act of 1925 provides for review, by Local Governmentsorders, at the end of one year.    3. Grounds for legislation as stated by  Bengal are as follows :-(i) Chittagongoutrage proved continued activity of revolutionaries.  All leaders had been previouslydealt with under  the Act of 1925 ; (ii) under Ordinance of 1-030 about  160 personshave been detained.  A number pf these are old revolutionaries, previously  dealtwith, and they continue to organise centres of terrorist  activity ; (iii)  ample evidence is available of collections of arms and  explosives in  increasing  quantities  and ofterrorist plots and of continued recruitment of boys and youths ; (iv) organisation isvery active and demand for violence is  increasing; (v) position is one of great anxietyand it is only through existing powers  that outward manifestations are kept in check.In these circumstances abrogation  of  powers cannot be contemplated without verygreat dangers resulting.    -1. Local  Government  have  considered  question of  temporary or  permanent legislation.   Both sides  of Government considered matter and their  unanimousopinion  is that Act should be  placed permanently on the Statute book.   Chiefreasons are; (i)  Experience has proved temporary Act ineffective  in dealing withevil; (ii) so long  as powers are liable to lapse,  revolutionary activity continues asproved  by  Chittagong;  (iii) temporary legislation has serious &apos; disadvantage  andconcession has no  practical effect on public opinion ; (iv) both sides of  government considered term of 10 or 15 years for operation of Act, but unanimously rejected it.    5. We have forwarded Bengal letter  by air mail, but fear it will not reach youbefore decision is required.   Above summary, however, gives main points.      Telegram from Secretary of State to Government of India, 25th July  1930.    2413.  Home Department.  I have considered your telegram of 21st July, 2360 S.,and it  appears to me  that whilst on the  one hand a new Ordinance would  at this moment have all  the  effect  of  an Act in  enabling  Local  Government to deal withterrorists, on  the  other  hand would not  a Bill certainly be rejected by the  BengalCouncil and need to be certified, and might not corresponding process be  required inthe Assembly ?    The former  plan would, of  course,  provoke  protest ;  but  the  latter  would; Iapprehend, involve-prolonged and bitter controversy.  Subject, therefore,  to anythingyou may have to urge, I should favour the issue of another Ordinance.         Telegram from Government of India  to Secrctarii of Stale for India,                                 25th July .1930.    2388 S.   Home  Department.   Reference  to  our telegram of  the 21st instant,No. 2360 S.,  regarding   legislation  to replace  Bengal Criminal  Law  AmendmentOrdinance, 1930.   We omitted to mention in previous telegram that Bill contains a clause similar to section 25 of Act  of 1925, by which action taken under  BengalCriminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1930,  will have effect as  though it had beentaken under legislation now proposed.    2.  We have now given careful  consideration  to the matter and  our  conclusions are : firstly, that legislation  is essential and,  secondly, that, subject to circumstancesmentioned  in para.  8  below,  it should  be permanent.    Regarding  necessity oflegislation  we have  already  given  views  of  the Bengal  Government, and wesupplement  these by  reference to  some features of revolutionary movement.  Wehave often   expressed our  belief  that  terrorist  activities  will  increase  as civildisobedience  movement  declines, and we are now able to give  some  reasons forthis belief.    There is  no doubt that the  violence party is an active and vigorous growth, andthat it  has recently been expanding in numbers and influence.   Its activities are nolonger regarded with general disapproval.  The laudation of revolutionaries who havedied on the  scaffold, and of persons like Bhagat Singh,* was  a marked feature of   * One ot&quot; the accused in the Lahore conspiracy case (Saimders&apos; murder) ;  previously convicted ofthrowing a bomb in the Assembly iii March 1929.  He led tho hunger-strike of the Lahore accused.
extremist press before Press Ordinance was promulgated, and similar eulogy has been.a feature of many public meetings.   The terrorist has the sympathy of  the majorityof the younger element  in  Congress, and  the support of a  considerable number.Terrorism  has been elevated into a policy which  its supporters believe capable of producing  important political  results, and their plans, as evidenced by Chittagougaffair, are now conceived on an ambitious scale.  Violent methods carry strong appealto youths, and many of the Youth Organisations are associated, directly or indirectly,with the terrorist movement.  A very disquieting feature is the continuous evidenceof increasing participation of students in terrorist plots.    3. Following are some of recent visible activities of the movement:       (a)  Distribution of  leaflets  of  extremely violent  character  has been common         during the past year,  especially iu Bengal, United Provinces and Punjab.     (b) In  our  previous telegram  we mentioned  the view  of  Bengal that  arms         and  ammunition were  being collected  in increasing  quantities  and  that         recruitment was very  active.  In addition  to Chittagong  there have been         extensive seizures  of bomb-making materials  in  Bengal, and  at  least two         attempts, both with bombs, have  been made on Jives of police officers.  A         number of Chittagong raiders  are still  at  large and  possess arms and         ammunition.     (c) Terrorists  have been  very active  in Punjab.  Since 1st January there have         been 20 bomb explosions in that province in addition  to number of cases of         recovery of bombs and explosives.    Two recent cases  of importance are,  firstly, plot  to rescue  accused in LahoreConspiracy Case  and,  secondly, simultaneous attempts  in  six places to commitoutrages upon the police.  In both  these  cases  there is  evidence of connection withBengal terrorists ;  and there is no doubt that terrorist  movements in Bengal, united provinces, Punjab and Delhi are linked up.    4.  Numerous  as attempted  outrages  have  been, they would  have been more frequent but for two  reasons:  firstly, violence party  are  watching result of civildisobedience  movement and  are holding their hands to a  considerable  extent;secondly, older revolutionaries  recognise  disadvantage of precipitating action andrestrain&apos; the  younger  members. But there is increasing evidence to show that the older men experience difficulty in restraining younger members, and that their control is not likely to be maintained much longer.    5.  In  Bengal,  the  police  are able,  although  with difficulty, to keep outwardmanifestations in check by existing powers which  can  be effectively exercised owing to knowledge of movement steadily built tip over considerable period.    Local Government considers that without these powers it would  be impossible for the police to  keep  even outward activities  in check, and we fully agree with this view. If control  were lost,  there would  be  serious danger  of repetition of Chittagong. Further, loss of  control in Bengal would give great impetus  to  the  movement in other Provinces.   We therefore consider  it essential that the  existing powers  should be retained.     0. The use of  Regulation  ill of 1818 as an alternative to legislation of this kind has been considered on previous occasions and has been rejected.  It is  inappropriate because, while  suitable  for dealing  with  occasional individuals, it is unsuitable for dealing with widespread conspiracies.  It would involve reference to the Government of India for each individual, and the procedure would  be so dilatory as to paralyse the local  authorities.   Moreover, the powers  now  in  question  provide more  elastic; method of dealing with the  less dangerous revolutionaries.   We  therefore have no doubt  that,  in  accordance with the decision taken in 1925, legislation is the proper course.     7.  The remaining  question  is  whether the legislation  should  be  permanent or temporary.   While recognising the theoretical or sentimental objections to  permanent legislation, we consider the following reasons fully justify it: :      (a) So long as legislation  is  for  a  period only,  conspirators continue secret          activities with the intention of committing outrages as soon as the powers          lapse.   During the  later  stages of  the  existence of the  Bengal Criminal          Law Amendment Act, the Bengal authorities to our knowledge felt  themselves          seriously hampered  by these conditions.   The Chittagong outrage was the          natural sequel.
     (b)  It is very significant that the leaders of the Chittagpng  raid, and also many         other revolutionaries detained under the Ordinance, are men who have been        - engaged in conspiracies  for many years.  This shows that in case of many         terrorists, ideas and activities are not merely passing phases.     (c) Temporary  legislation  causes difficulties at the time of expiry, and unless         organisation has  actually ceased  to  exist, may involve serious clanger to the         lives of Government officers and the public.     (J)  If the movement  definitely came to an end, exercise of powers under the Act         would automatically cease.  In any case, there  is no bar to repeal if future         conditions justify this, and a popular Government would  certainly take this         course as soon as the danger had really ceased.     (e)  We are unable  at present to forecast any period within which  these  powers         will  have ceased  to be necessary.   The conditions which produce  acute         discontent in Bengal are not merely political, but  are largely economic.  In         this  connection, we are  much  impressed by the fact that both  sides of the         Bengal Government take the view that permanent legislation is necessary.    S. The political advantage of temporary over permanent legislation  is negligible,unless  the  Provincial  Legislative Council were  prepared  to  pass Bill for limited period,  while  not  willing to pass permanent legislation.  We understand that  thereis a possibility of Bill  being passed by the Provincial  Council, but the position  is uncertain.   If it could  be  passed by the Local Government accepting an  amendmentof the Bill limiting its  operation to a period of not less than ten years,  the political advantage  might  perhaps  justify acceptance  of  the  undoubted  disadvantages  of temporary  legislation ;   and we are  prepared to ask  Local Governments to acceptamendment of this kind, if Bill can be  passed by this concession, but not otherwise.If permanent  legislation can be passed, then we consider that this should be pressed.If, on the other hand, even modified Bill cannot be passed, then we  consider that theGovernor should  certify permanent legislation, which we understand he  would wishto do.    9. Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment (Supplementary)Act, 1925, which was  placed before the  Central Legislature  aud  certified  by theGovernor-General, have lapsed.   Bengal  Government  do not ask at  present forCentral legislation, but  it  may  be necessary to undertake  this  in future in order to restore  powers under section 4  or to achieve the purpose of section 6.  In particular,if the Habeas  Corpus proceedings were  successful in the  High Court  in regard todetenus,  it would almost  certainly be  necessary to  re-enact section G  by Centrallegislation.  We accept this possible consequence of present proposals.    10. We should be grateful for very early approval, of the course above stated, asthe Local Government  requires the Governor-General&apos;s sanction not later than the31st July to the introduction of  the Bill. Telegram from Government of India to Secretary of State for India, 27th July 1930.    2414 S.  Home Department,   your telegram of the 25th instant, 2413, has crossedour telegram No. 2388 S. of same elate relating to  Bengal Criminal Law amendment bill.    We  have  dealt  fully in  our  telegram with the necessity for permanent legislation.  We  do  not consider that  renewal of  the Ordinance  would meet therequirements of the case.  It must be recognised that the conditions we  have to dealwith are likely to continue for many years and cannot, therefore,  be met by temporaryOrdinances.   It is out of the question for the Governor-General repeatedly to exercise his extraordinary  xDowers, and  renewal  of powers for  one, or even two periods of six months would  be altogether  ineffective.  In our  opinion, method of  legislation  is inevitable.  , Though legislation  will undoubtedly  involve controversy,  we do notapprehend its consequences  will  he  as serious  as  you suggest; indeed,  with thememory of Chittagong  still fresh, we believe  there  may. be a good deal of at leasttacit acquiescence in  the proposals.
