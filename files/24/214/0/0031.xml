[This Document is  the  Property  ol His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1930.                                        3*CABINET.                                    TIBET.Question of Instructions to the British Envoy recently  sent to Lhasa    in  regard  to  the  resumption  of negotiations  with  China  and    facilities for  the supply  of Arms to  Tibet.      MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR  INDIA.    In Cabinet Paper 118 (30) of 5th April, I circulated  for the information of my colleagues a statement of the satisfactory solution of the difficulties which had arisen towards the end  of  last year between Nepal  and Tibet.   The Government of India subsequently received  an invitation from the Dalai  Lama  to  despatch a  British representative to Lhasa for purposes of general discussion.  After consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I approved this proposal, and  Colonel Weir, the Political Officer  in  Sikkim,  is now on his way to  Lhasa, which he  is expected to reach on or about the 4th August.    2. After  sanction had been given for Colonel Weir&apos;s visit,  the Government of India asked for instructions as  to the line to he  taken by him  should the Dalai Lama wish to  discuss the question  of  the resumption of  negotiations with China regarding Tibetan affairs.  The position as regards  this is  that we have for  many years been anxious to reach, in agreement with Tibet and China, a final  settlement  of relations between those two countries, and particularly as regards the Sino-Tibetan frontier.  The general basis on which we have proceeded has been that  Tibet should  be recognised as an autonomous state under Chinese suzerainty.   Negotiations,  which  were resumed in 1919 on the basis of a Chinese offer which appeared to afford a satisfactory prospect of  settlement, broke down in 1921, and have not since been  resumed, mainly for extraneous reasons.    3. The Government of India consider (and their view is accepted by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and myself) that no useful purpose is likely to be served at the present moment  by endeavouring to revive the negotiations.  (The principal difficulty is the absence  of a strong Central Government and the fact that  the Chinese Government are preoccupied by internal conditions.)  They indicate, however, that if we  feel bound to advise the  Tibetan  Government  to  postpone  the  reopening of negotiations until there is greater prospect of their fortunate  outcome, the Tibetans may counter with a request for facilities  to obtain the material  assistance necessary to maintain their present position in certain districts on the Chinese frontier the position of which is  in dispute between China  and  Tibet, and the future  of which  can be decided only in  formal negotiations.  The Government  of  India remark : &quot; In the event of our refusal, Tibet, we think, would be able  to obtain what  she wanted  from other sources to our serious disadvantage, and subject, therefore,  to  your  approbation we must, we consider, be prepared to meet reasonable requests for materials, especially munitions, beyond the  limits to which we are.already engaged.   Supplies would of course be on payment  and  subject to the same conditions as before.&quot;  The &quot; same conditions as  before&quot;  were that *&apos;the  Tibetan Government gives an assurance in writing that such munitions will be used  solely for self-defence  and for internal police work.&quot;    4. After discussion,  and in agreement, with the Secretary of  State  for Foreign Affairs, I propose,  subject to  the approval  of  my colleagues,  to  approve the&apos; Government of India&apos;s recommendation,  but to couple my approval with an intimation that it remains the policy of His majesty&apos;s Government to reach  a friendly settlement between China and  Tibet as  soon  as conditions make this possible; that it is most important that our representative should make this clear if the Dalai Lama raises the question, and  that nothing should be said or  done by our representative to justify any suggestion that Tibet is being supplied with arms to establish her position against lier suzerain, or to expose us to criticism on grounds of international equity, and thatSECRET.CP. 280(30).4677    75  7.30
facilities for the purchase of the supplies desired and the maintenance of the presentposition on the Chinese-Tibetan frontier should not be in any way linked.   5. In submitting this recommendation to my colleagues, I would emphasise (and my views are accepted by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs) that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have not only incurred certain general obligations towards Tibet in thematter of her relations with China, but that it is definitely to their  interest that thepresent territorial status quo on the Sino-Tibetan  frontier should  he  maintained  until such time as a formal settlement of the frontier  can be reached.  In  these  circum-stances, and having regard to the undertakings to  be required from the Tibetans asto the use to be made of the arms in question, I have no hesitation in recommending the present proposal.   I would only add that, while it is impossible at this  stage toform any idea of the scale of a  possible Tibetan demand, it is, in my judgment, likelyto be relatively exceedingly small.  The Tibetan  Government have not yet exhaustedcertain  limited  facilities for the  purchase of arms granted them  in   1921  by HisMajesty&apos;s Government ; their country is a poor one, and the  extent to which they arelikely to want or be able to pay for supplies  (and supplies are to be granted  only on payment) will probably he very limited indeed.
