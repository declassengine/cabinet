              AGRICULTURAL :. POLICY.    j^oyajjdrtm^by -the Secretary of State for Scotland,        If the production of memoranda upon british agriculture could have saved agriculture it would havebeen a highly prosperous industry by this time,   I donot propose to re-cover the ground I have covered ix.previous notes and papers, but would merely reaffirmmy conviction that the agricultural industry Is ripeand ready for. such highly desirable changes and reformsas       (a) the development of experimental farms,           I have a promise of&apos;funds from a private           donor,&apos; lir, T.B, iiiacaulay of Canada  for           the purpose of investigating the improve-           ment of large tracts of barren land within           easy reach of Edinburgh and Glasgow.  I           propose also making immediate arrangements           for experimental farm reclamation on the           great Flanders Moss; -       (b) Small holdings, with-every encouragement           to co-operation in the marketing of the           produce j       (c) The elimination of the scrub bull;&apos;       (d) The establishment of additional abattoirs           owned and managed by fanners societies.
          (e) Encouragement of research work             particularly in contagious             ab or t i on, tub e r cul o 3 is and tr ac ke n             elimination;;          (f) Arrangements whereby  the Agricul-             tural Credits Scotland Act may be             made operative by enabling the             existing Loan Corporation set up                             A3t             under the English/to  function for             the United Kingdom.          (g) Import Ecards particularly to deal             with commodities where organised             dumping as in oats is proved.          In my opinion theso and the reforms proposed bythe Minister of Agriculture are an indispensable part ofa great agricultural policy, but I would emphasise withall the power at my disposal that  our Marketing Bill isa first and vital and most urgent necessity.         There would indeed not appear to be.much need of expanding the numbers of; people engaged in an industryuntil we  can first of all give an  opportunity of aneconomic  livelihood to those who are presently threatened with ruin in it.   We ought at once to give the industry a. chance  of orderly marketing and  of eliminating the chaoticscramble  among our home food producers, - a scramble whichbenefits none but middlemen;          Our Marketing Bill does that and I have taken every possible  opportunity of sounding Scottish agricultural opinionon the subject.   Recently for example, the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Scotland had a meeting withforty-five delegates to the Executive Council of the National
Farmers&apos;  Union in Scotland.   At the conclusion ofthe meeting the general principles we have since eibodied in our Bill were approved &quot;by acclamation&quot;.There we.ro no dissenters to the principles of -      (a) compulsion on the minority (ho,          protection for the majority from          -underselling, producing low grade          qualities, etc, )      (b) possible recognition of the pools          and co-operative organisations set          up by the industry itself as the          appropr iat e organisat ion for          operating the Act,   (This I regard,          as fundamental.   It encourages          the co-operative Idea for which wc          stand and it accords with en-          lightened farming experience, not          only in the milk and potato trades          in Scotland, &quot;cut In other agricul-          tural products in various parts of          the world);      (c) snforcibilioy of contract as between          the produeor and the Board or Pool          with, which he has contacted;      (d) power to raise. loans upon the          security of moyeable products;  and      (o) the appointment by the Secretary of          State of committees representative          of the consumers&apos; interests who          would discuss prices, etc. with the          Producers Boards and make represen-          tat ions to the Secretary of State
           who, under Clause 7 of the Bill,           has power to revoke an order if           he Is not satisfied that it should           be continued.   The consumers&apos;           interests are thus adequately pro-           tec tod.           I should add that theso main principles arealso approved by tho Secretary of the Scottish Farm Servants&apos;Union, by the chief officials of the Co-operative Agricul-tural Organisations and by Major Sprot, the Chairman of therecont Committee of Enquiry into Agricultural Go-operation.           These are the main points 1 have been discussing with the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and I am happy to say we have now reached an agreement upon them.    (a)  isembodied In the strvicturc of the Bill,  (b),  (c) and  (d) arein the Scottish application Clause and  (e)  is incorporated in Clause 7, although upon this point perhaps the draftingmight be a little more  definite.           I would most strongly urge that  the Bill beintroduced forthwith.   Its introduction would give  encourage-xnent to enlightened agricultural opinion everywhere;  indeed it would have  an important rallying effect  upon our  own Party,who would greatly appreciate any effort at  orderly marketing;it would, 1 firmly believe, transform the  political  situationin our favour  In the rural districts, and  would place-our opponents in a very difficult political position.
