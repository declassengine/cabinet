A Sub-Committee of tho Oil Beard was set upin November, 1929, by tho direction of tho Prime  Ministerto investigate tho present position with regard to thetreatment of coal which may affect the demand&apos;:;and supplycf oil and their report, which doals with Low TemperatureCarbonisation, Pulverise! Coal and tho Eydrcgcration ofCoal is incorporated in the Fifth Anr.ua! Report of the oil Board to the Committee of Imperial Lsfenco.2.        From, this report it is clear that the mostimportant development of tha three preoessos investigated,from tho point of view of reducing oil imports and assistingunemployment, is the hydrogonation of coal.   The processin this country is entirely in the hands&apos; of imperial chemical Industries who have indicated that thsy do not anticipate being in a position to put forward any proposalto His Majesty&apos;s Government for tho development of theprocess until the Autumn of this year:  they state confidentlyhowever, that with a commercial si7,od plant built on thelines of their existing small scale plant, they will be ablet&apos;) produce petrel at an economical price from oral.   It was.however, suggested that the Government Departments might inthe meant in. a obtain samples of the oil produced by imperial chemical Industries and carry out tests&apos; and trials with thorn.
                                                     -     12 i3,        I would suggest that the Admiral tj, War Officeand Air Ministry should advise Imperial Chemical industries of the specifications cf the various gradea of oil used bythese departments and that  samples should he obtained and teats and trials be carried out.  so that when proposals are made tc His MajestyTs Coveminent by Imperial chemical industries later in the year, reports will be availableregarding the quality of the oils produced,                          (Signed)  THOMSON.3, V.bit eh ail Gardens , S .rv.i,
