(27) 57.COPY NOO A B I N H T.HA)U0ffIOJU Alii) LIMITATION ov ARsMMEMTS.COMMITTEE Oil POLICY^THE 0ER4AN PROPOSALS FOR THE PREVENTION OF WAR.REPORT.The German Proposals for the prevention of War, which are reproduced as an Appendix to Enclosure I to this report, were considered by us in the first instance, and then, at our request, wex*e submitted to the Chiefs of Staff Sab-Committee fcr examination and report from the strategical aspect.     This report  (paper Eoa COoSo 180) is attached as Enclosure I.     The Chiefs of Staff report was then communicated to the Segal Advisers to the Foreign Office, for their observations.    Thes-e are contained in a report by Sir Oecil Hurst  (attached* together with a memorandum by M, Rolin Jaequemyns - the Rapporteur on this subject to the Arbitration and Security Committee at Geneva,- as Enclosure II).       finally the Ghiofs Of Staff 8nh^(mmi.ttQe-Te&amp;oiigldered their report in the light of Sir Cecil HurstTs observations and drew up a further report [Paper Ho. 060oBft 167), which forms Enclosure III to this paper.TZith the above material before us, we met again to consider the German Proposals, and arrived at the conclusions stated belew.      In order to clarify the issues involved, we first eliminated those proposals, which, in the light of the examination to which they had been subjected, were obviously&apos; THIS nOOtiMKHT^ia^THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
3 3unaocep table, - and then praoe^dod to cxmsii&amp;er vrike^ther th  remainder wea^e acceptable as they   stood or susceptible to such modifications as would render them acceptable.   We preptse to adopt the same procedure in this report. 3^ Proceeding on these lines we find that Articles II,IV and V of the German proposals are wholly ohjeotionable. (a)   Article, II.In case of threat of war the States might undertakein advance to aeeept and,to execute the recommendationsof the Council to the effect of maintaining or re-.establishing the military statos cjuo^normally existing in time of peace.The Chiefs of Staff point out that &quot;the effect of this Article is to prevent the taking of precautionary aeasures for defence, acceleration of the delivery of munitions or the necessary redistribution of foroes to be put into operation.    Such a provision xrould give an undue advantage to the real aggressor; who would take very good oare to see that considerable, but invisible, precautionary measures had been taken before the dispute arose&quot;.     Moreover, they show that ^here is no possibility of ensuring that the maintenance of the 1status guor is being enforced during a period of tension&quot;.     The chiefs of Staff thoiproceed to emphasise these objections by citing the observations put forward by them in a report drawn up in October, 1924,  on the Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes. There is no need for us to reiterate these arguments, which can be found *n reference to Snclosure I.    It will suffice for us to say that we are convinced that the case against the acceptance of Article II is overwhelming, fb) Article IV.The question should bo considered whether the above mentioned obligations should be undertaken only in case of a unanimous vote of the Council (the votes
34of the parties to the dispute net being; counted), or whether the majority,   simple or qual5.f ied, might sixffice^in the matter,    ^ jkhenaore,  it should be considered in what form the obligations would have i -^?-.^ 2:!i.!I-H.E in order to bring them into conformity with^jthejDovenant. This article contemplates a possible departure from the principle deliberately adopted by the framers of the Covenant that the Council must be unanimous in arriving at decisions,    The objections to such a departure have often been stated,  and need not be set out again here. We feel sure that the article vail find little favour in any quarter,  and, indeed,  we have been informed that the Germans themselves have no 7/ish to press for its adoption. (c ) Article V.These obligations might constitute the obj eot of an agreement or of a protocol which would bo open for signature by all States Members and non-Members of the League of Nations,  and which might come into force separately for the several continents, in a way similar to that provided for in the draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance of 1985v This Article proposes the drawing up of a general Protocol.    We are opposed to such a method of procedure, and think that the inclusion of a special clause,  embodying such of these proposals as may ultimately be accepted, in any bilateral or multilateral agreements is more appropriate for the purpose.    We understand that this latter method also finds favour with the authors of the proposals and tho adoption of a general protocol will not be urged,, 4. Only Articles I and III therefore remain forconsideration, (a) Article I.In case of a dispute being submitted to the
35Council the States might undertake in advance to accept and -execute provisional recommendations of the Council for the ourpose of prevonting any aggrayation or extension of the dispute and 1 rap e ding any measures t0-k^^!^EQH. by the parties which might exercise an unfavourab1e reaction on the execution of the settle-ment to be^ proposed by the Council, This article is so drawn that it may be construed as enabling the Council to make recommendations,  such as those which are contemplated by Article II.    As we have already indicated Article II is in our view unacceptable.    It follows, therefore,  tnat to this extent Article I is a3.so unacceptable. But Article I may also be construed as involving proposals other than those under Article II.    In this connection we wish to point out that the Covenant of the League already contains provisions which have a bearing on this question.    Para. I of Article 12 of the Covenant readsj-&quot;l.    The Members of the League agree that If there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture they will submit the matter either to arbitration or judicial settlement or to enquiry by the Council, and they agree in no case to resort to war until three months after the award by the arbitrators or the judicial decision or the report by the Council.&quot; It will be observed that, whereas Article 12 of theCovenant and Article I of the German Proposals are related to one another, there is this difference between them viz:- by Article 12 of the Covenant States agree that, if and when a dispute should arise between them, thoy will submit the matter to enquiry by the Council: while by Article I of the German Proposals States undertake in advance to accept and execute the recommendations of the Council for dealing with the dispute.
36But there Is a further resolution of the Council which is directly in point.     We refer to the resolution adopted by the Covmcil at its recent, meeting (5th Meeting held on June 7th) In connection with the *StcGothard Arms Incident&quot;*     This resolution reads&quot;   fI.   The Council&apos; considers that^ when a question has been submitted for its examination, it is extremely desirable that the Governments concerned should take whatever steps may be necessary or useful to prevent anything occurring In their respective territories which might prejudice the examination or settlement of the question by the Council.2.    &apos; When there is submitted to the Council a request for investigation or the case of a dispute which has been placed on the agenda under paragraph 2 of Article II, or other articles of the Covenant, such as Articles 13 or 15, the Secretary-General shall immediately communicate with the interested parties, drawing their attention to the resolution under (I) above, requesting them, in the name of the Council, to forward their replies to him without delay for communication to the Council and to inform him of the steps which have been taken.1  * We very much doubt whether there are any safeguards applicable under Article I of the German Proposals, which are not either  (a) already covered by Article  12 of the Covenant or the resolution of the Council quoted above, or (b) definitely excluded, as objectionable because they come under /article II of the German Proposals.
37Nevertheless, there may be some such safeguards, and we feol that it would be expedient that the British Sepresenta-tive at Genova should intimate that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment is ready to give favourable consideration to any proposals of this nature, which may be suggested, (b) Article III.In the caseu of hostilities of any, kind breaking put, without, in the CouncilTs opinion, all possibilities of a paoifio,settlement having been exhausted, the States might undertake in adYancei to accept, on the Council^ proposal., an armistice on land and sea and in/bhe air, including: especially the obligation of the two parties in dispute to withdraw the forces which might have penetrated into foreign territory and to secure the respect of the sovereignty of the other State.The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Connittoe point out that &quot;this Article nay be said to attempt the almost impossible task of enforcing an armistice on a State which has made up its mind to be an aggressor&quot;, and requote their observations on a similar provision in the Geneva protocol. It appears to us that the real objection to this proposal lies in the use of the term &quot;armistice&quot; which implies a simultaneous provisional settlement of a number of subsidiary questions such as the procedure in regard to reinforcements or supplies on the way to the combatant forces, the movements of the forces themselves,  etc., eto. It therefore occurred to us that if the Article provided merely for a &quot;cessation of hostilities&quot; rather than an &quot;Armistice&quot; this objection might be overcome.     We accordingly requested the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee to examine a redraft of this Article embodying the above
38suggestion.      The Report of the Chiefs of Staff is attached as Enclosure IV.It will be observed that the proposed amendment would leave a power, which had been the victim of an aggression, free to take all measures, apart from actual fighting, which might be deemed advisable to parry the blow which had been directod against it.     As a general proposition, therefore, such a provision would react in the favour of a Power, such as the British Empire, whose forces are necessarily scattered in peace and require time to concentrate to meet an aggression.     To this extent then the Article as modified is an improvement on the original text.     But it will be observed too that the modified version would leave the aggressor also free to aa&amp;opt such measures as he may deem desirable to improve his position. Having regard to the recognised fact that an active offensive is often the best form of defence, and that, where air forces are involved, it is by offensive action In the early stages of a struggle when concentrations are being effected, that aggressive movements are countered, it will be appreciated that the modified, version Oi  the Article will not necessarily act in favour of the victim of aggression, but will often prove to be of advantage to the aggressor.Article III also imposes en obligation &quot;to withdraw the forces which might have penetrated into foreign territory and to secure the , e-epeot of the sovereignty of the other State&quot;.      In this case, too, as a general proposition, the undertaking may be held to be favourable to the victim of aggression, but it does not follow that this will necessarily always be so.      Special provisions may be introduced into the/
39Article to meet cases where a &quot;demilitarised zone&quot; has been established, but it will be impossible to fbhesee and provide for cases where, for example, weak States are Interposed between two great Pcwers and may be coerced Into allying themselves with one or the other parties to the dispute with a view to the utilisation of their territories for purposes of aggression.In spite of these objections,  serious as they may be, we feel that,  on balance, an Article on the lines indicated below may prove advantageous,  and that reliance must   be placed on the discretion of the Council not to implement the Article in those cases where its application will operate to the obvious disadvantage of the party which is the victim cf aggression.Vve suggest,  therefore, that, the original   text of this Article might be altered to read:*-&quot;In the case of hostilities breaking out without,  in the CouncilTs opinion,  all possibilitiesof a pacific settlement having been exhausted, theCouncil shall forthwith take the matter into con-duesideration and if, having/regard to the equities of the case and the consequences tp the parties, they think fit,  they may propose and the States might undertake in advance, to accept,  on the Council&apos;s proposal, to cease hostilities;    to respect the territory and the sovereignty of the other State, and the obligations attaching by -   treaty to any demilitarised area;    and to withdraw the forces which might have penetrated into the territory of the other State or into any demilitarised area&quot;.
40Finally we wish to make it quite clear that, in our view the wisest course would he to reject the German Proposals in their entirety.     There is always this disadvantage in attempting to    prescribe in advance for future contingencies,   that thereby an indication is given of the line of action which will follow upon certain events,      A State with evil intentions is thus enabled to gauge in advance,  and provide against, the probable re-actions which will follow from any aggressive attempts on his part. In extreme cases he ma7/ deliberately provoke these re-actions, in order to turn them to his advantage. \&quot;;e understand that it is quite likely that the German Proposals will not meet with support at Geneva,  and may be rejected without the British Representative taking any prominent part in their rejection.      If this proves- to be the case,  It is the best solution of the problem.      It  is only,  in the event of the German Proposals being likely to be adopted,  that we recommend that the British Representative should secure their modification on the lines indicated above, rather than be exposed to the charge of advocating their rejection intpto.(Signed)  SALISBURY.(Chairman).2 Whitehall Gardens, S.w.(l). 23rd June,  1926.
41[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;g Government.]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   June 1928.Enclosure I.   . 1SECRET. Copy No.   137C.O.S. 160.COMMITTEE! OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS.The German Proposals for the Prevention of War. (Previous Paper No. C.O.S. 153.)REPORT.AT the request of Lord Salisbury&apos;s Cabinet Committee on the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments, and with the authority of the Prime Minister, we have been asked to examine and report on the German Proposals for the Prevention of War. A copy of these proposals, together with a resolution thereon by the League of Nations Committee on Arbitration and Security, is attached as an Appendix to this Report.2. Before proceeding to a detailed examination of each of the Articles contained in the German Proposals, we desire to make the following general observations. The German Proposals bear a remarkable similarity to the Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes. Indeed, apart from the fact that they make no mention of the imposition of sanctions, the general character of the German proposals is almost identical with the provisions of the Protocol, which, it will be remembered, did not meet with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government.3. In effect both the Protocol and the German proposals would prohibit Govern-ments from taking measures which they consider essential from the point of view of national security. The argument that in a dispute both parties are equally affected by such a prohibition is fallacious; the nature of the crisis, the geographical situation and the relative preparedness for war of the disputants are factors which may weigh down the scales heavily against one of them, and make it impossible for its Government to accept the status quo. For example, a naval Power with its forces dispersed, involved unexpectedly in a serious dispute with a Power whose naval forces are concentrated, could not accept an instrument which in fact prohibited the movement of ships necessary to effect a concentration. The German proposals as a whole have as their basis the idea of arrested military activity in time of crisis. A position of arrested military activity would in many circumstances be dangerous, and might even invite attack for an enemy more highly prepared and more favourably situated strategically; indeed, a premium would be placed on preparedness for war.4. With the foregoing general observations we pass to a detailed examination of each of the Articles.[17748]
Article I. Incase of a dispute being submitted to the Council, the States might undertake in advance to accept and execute provisional recommendations of the Council for the purpose of preventing any aggravation or extension of the dispute and impeding any measures to be taken by the parties which might exercise an unfavourable reaction on the execution of the settlement to be proposed by the Council.5. This article gives undefined and comprehensive powers to the Council to take any measures to prevent the extension of a dispute. The signatories bind themselves in advance to accept the Council&apos;s decision. We do not believe that unlimited discretionary powers should be given to the Council or that we should pledge ourselves in advance to accept them.Article II. In case of threat of war the States might undertake in advance to accept and to execute the recommendations of the Council to the effect of maintaining or re-establishing the military status quo normally existing in time of peace.6. The effect of this Article is to prevent the taking of precautionary measures for defence, acceleration of the delivery of munitions or the necessary redistribution of forces to be put into operation. Such a provision would give an undue advantage to the real aggressor, who would have taken very good care to see that considerable but invisible precautionary measures had been taken before the dispute arose.7. Moreover, there is no possibility of ensuring that the maintenance of the status quo is being enforced during a period of tension. It is not difficult to imagine the accusations and counter accusations which would be made by either side, none of which could be verified. The effect of this Article would, therefore, be to penalise the State with pacific intentions, and its provisions would be impossible to carry out in practice.8. In this connection, we draw attention to the observations put forward by the three Chiefs of Staff in October 1924 in a joint Memorandum (C.I.D. Paper No. 527-B) on the Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes. With regard to Article 7 of that Protocol, they said &quot; This Article would prevent such measures as the following :  Naval.1. The concentration of the Fleet at its War anchorage would be illegal, with the result that, on war being declared, our forces might not only be scattered, but also be situated in harbours open to air or submarine attack. In the late War the concentration of the Fleet at Scapa Flow would have been illegal.2. The movement of the Fleet to any threatened area, which is a purely defensive action, would be debarred.3. Organisation and expansion of Anti-Submarine measures.4, Organisation and expansion of Minesweeping arrangements.-5. Taking up of auxiliaries, such as ammunition carriers, tankers, frozen meat ships.Military.Measures for anti-aircraft defence take some considerable time to set up, whereas attack by aircraft within their radius of action can be launched at short notice.In peace time it is not the usual practice to maintain coast defences in readiness for action, whereas warships can appear off the coast and harbours of their enemy in instant readiness to bombard.Air.(a.) Mobilisation and concentration of the Auxiliary Squadrons.(&amp;.) Movement of Squadrons to war aerodromes.(c.) Movement of supplies, spares, &amp;c.(d.) Possibly even routine movements of personnel.&quot;
9. Although probably not suitable for inclusion in a despatch to the Secretary General of the League of Nations, we think it would not b.e out of place to remind His Majesty&apos;s Government that, had either the Protocol or the proposals now under con-sideration been in force at the time, none of the measures taken to deal with the crisis in China would have been permissible, and the despatch of the Shanghai Defence Porce and additional naval and air forces to the threatened area could not have taken place. The above example will serve to illustrate the great limitations which would be imposed on a Power, such as the British Empire, which relies on. sea communica-tions and the mobility of her available forces to safeguard her interests throughout the world.10. Should any provision such as that contemplated by this Article be accepted, only two alternatives would present themselves, namely- (a.) In peace time to maintain on a war footing at enormous &quot;expense those services or units which are earmarked for creation or expansion in time of emergency in other words, a large increase in peace establish-ments; or(&amp;.) To accept such a state of unpreparedness as might have far-reaching, and possibly disastrous, results at the outbreak of hostilities.Article III. In the case of hostilities of any kind breaking out without, in the CounciVs opinion, all possibilities of a pacific settlement having been exhausted, the States might undertake in advance to accept, on the CounciVs proposal, an armistice on land and sea and in the air, including especially the obligation of the two parties in dispute to withdratv the forces which might have penetrated into foreign territory, and to secure the respect of the sovereignty of the other State.11. This Article may be said to attempt the almost impossible task of enforcing an armistice on a State which has made up its mind to be an aggressor. In this connection we think it appropriate to refer once again to the views of the Chiefs of Staff as quoted in the Report of the Sub-Committee on the Geneva Protocol (C.I.D. Paper No. 559-B) viz. : &quot; 42. We desire at this point to draw attention to the provisions in the third paragraph of article 10, whereby, if the Council does not at once succeed in determining the aggressor, it shall be bound to enjoin upon the belligerents an armistice, shall fix the terms, acting, if need be, by a two-thirds majority, and shall supervise its execution. The Chiefs of Staff point out the difficulties of imposing an armistice oh belligerents once hostilities have broken out, and state that an armistice, unless set up with the consent of both parties, is useless. We have discussed the matter with the representatives of the Fighting Services, and we agree with them that the difficulties of imposing an armistice are in many cases likely to be overwhelming. We also discussed with them the possibility of substituting something less than an armistice, such as a mere cessation of fighting. They have convinced us, however, that this is impracticable. The moment an attempt is made to stop fighting, all sorts of subsidiary questions must inevitably be settled provisionally at the same time, such as the procedure in regard to reinforcements or supplies on their way by sea, land or air; movement of forces in general, as also of supplies, both for the armies and the civil population; aerial reconnaissance and many other matters, which will vary in each case.The observations quoted above apply with equal force to the German Proposals.Article IV. The question should be considered whether the above mentioned obligations should be undertaken only in case of a unanimous vote of the Council [the votes of the parties to the dispute not being counted), or whether the majority, simple or qualified, might suffice in the matter. Furthermore, it should be considered in what form the obligations would have to be drawn tip in order to bring them into conformity with the Covenant.12. This Article contemplates a possible departure from the principle deliberately adopted by the framers of the Covenant that the Council must be unanimous in arriving at decisions.   Here again, we think we cannot do better than[17748] b 2
to refer to the views expressed on this point by the Sub-Committee on the Geneva Protocol in para. 43 of their Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 559-B), namely : &quot;43. Apart from its impracticability, this part of article 10 is open to strong objection on the ground that the Council, in fixing the terms of the armistice, can act by a two-thirds majority. A nation which refuses bo accept the armistice or violates its terms becomes an aggressor, and the Council : thereupon calls upon the Signatory States to apply sanctions. Suppose, for example, that in a given case the British representative demurs to the terms of a proposed armistice on the ground that they are oppressive, impracticable, and must only lead to a continuance of hostilities. The Council overrules him and imposes the armistice by a two-thirds majority. The expected happens and hostilities break out. The Council is then bound to call for sanctions. In effect, therefore,,the decision to impose sanctions will have been taken in respect of an action which, in its inception, had not been deemed by the British representative on the Council to be a breach of the protocol.&quot;13. In this connection we confine ourselves to reiterating the views previously expressed on this subject, to the effect that the British Empire should not, under any circumstances, agree to be committed to any line of action unless her representative on the Council has been a consenting party to the decision of the Council.Article V. These obligations might constitute the object of an agreement or of a protocol which would be open for signature by all States Members and non-Members of the League of Nations, and which might come into force separately for the several continents, in a way similar to that provided for in the draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance of 1923.. 14. This Article requires no- observations on our part as it deals merely with the question bf procedure in the event of the previous proposals having been accepted.H. TRENCHARD. CHARLES E. MADDEN. G. F.

APPENDIX.Suggestion of the German Delegation with a view to preventing war.WITH a view to preventing war the Committee on Arbitration and Security-might examine the following possibilities : I.In case of a dispute being submitted to the Council, the States might undertake in advance to accept and execute provisional recommendations of the Council for the purpose of preventing any aggravation or extension of the dispute and impeding any measures to be taken by the parties which might exercise an unfavourable reaction on the execution of the settlement to be proposed by the Council.II,In case of threat of war, the States might undertake in advance to accept and to execute the recommendations of the Council to the effect of maintaining or re-establishing the military status quo normally existing in time of peace.III.In the case of hostilities of any kind breaking out without, in the Council&apos;s opinion, all possibilities of a pacific settlement having been exhausted, the States might undertake in advance to accept, on the Council&apos;s proposal, an armistice on land and sea and in the air, including especially the obligation of the two parties in dispute to withdraw the forces which might have penetrated into foreign territory and to secure the respect of the sovereignty of the other State.IV.The question should be considered whether the above mentioned obligations should be undertaken only in case of a unanimous vote of the Council (the votes of the parties to the dispute not being counted), or whether the majority, simple or qualified, might suffice in the matter. Furthermore, it should be considered in what form the obligations would have to be drawn up in order to bring them into conformity with the Covenant.V. -These obligations might constitute the object of an agreement or of a protocol which would be open for signature by all States Members and non-Members of the League of Nations, and which might come into force separately for the several continents, in a way similar to that provided for in the draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance of 1923.Resolution by the Committee on Arbitration and Security regarding theGerman Delegation^ Suggestions.The Committee on Arbitration and Security,Having taken note of the suggestions submitted to it by the German delegation with a view to reinforcing the methods of preventing war; andAppreciating the great importance of these suggestions :  -Considers that they should be thoroughly examined and that Governments should be enabled to study them in detail; andDecides to place them on the agenda of its next session and to appoint a Rapporteur, who will report to the Committee in the light of the Committee&apos;s discussion and of any observations which may be forwarded by Governments.

MCLOSURE.QfERMAN SUGG-ESTXONS FOR THE PREVENTION OF WAR. Hots by Sir 0. Hurst^The report of the Chiefs of Staff sub-committee is shown by its date to have been prepared after a study of the text only of the German proposals and before the receipt of the memorandum by Baron Rolin Jaequemyns who is acting as &quot;rapporteur&quot; for the Security Committee at Geneva on this subject.    In. view of the contents of the memorandum, reproducing as it does the substance of the discussions at Geneva, in February,  some parts of the report of the chiefs of Staff sub-committee seem to require reconsideration.The first German proposal is that the parties to the proposed agreement should undertake to act in accordance with recommendations made by the Council of the League for .the prevention, of any aggravation or extension of the dis-pute while it is under consideration by&apos; the Council.The Chiefs of Staffs report on this point is limited to an expression of dissent from the policy of giving unlimited discretionary power to the Council and of giving any pledge to accept the recommendations! of the Council.M. Rolin Jaequemyns1  memorandum shows that it Is realised that trie re must be some limitation on the power given to tne Council.    There is,  therefore, no question of giving that body unlimited powers.    What the restrictions should he is a matter which should be worked out at Geneva.    Those suggested in his memorandum seem to be sound.    They are  (a) that the Council should not be entitled to prescribe any provisional measures which encroach on matters which fall solely within the domestic jurisdiction-1--&quot;- Reproduced as an Appendix to this Paper.
46of thestate concerned,   e. gtariffs; and (b) that pro-visional measures should not be ordained ivhore the nature of the dispute is such that adequate reparation can be made for the matter complained of by the payment of monetary compensation.    It is also suggested (c) that the Council should only be authorised to recommend provisional measures when the dispute is such as to en-danger the maintenance of peace.This last limitation is certainly one wnich I think jfci.M. Government should support.    There is too great a tendency to draw deductions from the anaXogous powers con-ferred on national or international tribunals when dealing with disputes submitted to them.    The Council is primarily a political body whose function is the preservation of peace.    The power to ordain provisional measures should be given to it only with that end in view.It is too late in the day to attempt to exclude the activities of the Council in these matters.    Great Britain has already agreed in Articles 11 and 15 of the Covenant to extensive powers being wielded by the Council,  and the best thing now is to support any policy which will enable those functions to be discharged effectively.If there is a dispute likely to lead to a rupture, there is always the risk that some provocative act on the part of. one party or the other to the dispute may so inflame popular feeling as to precipitate a conflict; consequently the cause of peace will be helped by there being vested in some organ a power to prevent or to con-trol such acts.Even if that is granted, however,  it must be remembered that acts which to the other side apoear to be
provocative may well be prompted, by considerations of self-defence, by a desire that the other side shall not be allowed to get into an advantage ens position.    The meet hopeful way of achieving the desired, end may well be to give the Council, the body already Charged with the duty of preserving peace, the power to prevent either party taking action against which the other party would have to adopt precautionary measures.    She Council is in a position to deal with both sides impartially, and is equipped with permanent technical advisers  (the P.A.G. established under Article 8) who will prevent it issuing any unwise recommendations.It may bo taken f.CT. granted that the Council will err on the side of doing too little rather than too much.    The league has no force behind it except public opinion, and the Council will always be restrained by the feeling that if it recommends impracticable measures, public opinion will not support it0So long as no rule admitting majority decisions Is accepted it is not likely that any recommendation which would endanger the defensive measures of this Government on the eve of a crisis in which Great Britain was a party concerned in the dispute would meet with the unanimous support of all the other- members of   the Council,    even if Great Britain were not herself at liberty to vote 3. The second German proposal is that if there isa threat of war the parties to the proposed agreement should undertake to accept th&quot; recommendations of the Council for maintaining or re-establishing the normal military status quo of peace time.The Chiefs of Staffs report is opposed to the acceptance of this proposal because it would prevent
prooautibhary: measures for defence;  because of the difficulty of ensuring the: maintenance of the stfi-tus quo; - because it would, penalise the state with pacific intentions; and because its provisions could not be carried out in practice.4. Part of what has been siad above in ,Para.2 appliesequally to the second German proposal and to the Chiefs of Staffs criticism on It.    The risks $M&amp;olved. in the acceptance of the German px^proposal and the disadvantages it entails have been recognised frankly in the Rolin *Tacquomyns memorandum.    They were voiced by lord Cushendun at Geneva in his speech on February 29, 1928, at the eleventh meeting of the Security Committee.5. On the other hand no one will deny that in the periodpreceding the outbreak of hostilities, provocative action on one side or the other may easily precipitate a conflict, and that it is to the general interest that conflict should be avoided if possible.    The aim must be to find some machinery which will give reasonable hope of increasing the chance that the conflict will be avoided without involving an undue risk that necessary defensive precautions may be jeopardised6. Clearly the method by which the risk of a conflict isdiminished is by getting both parties to keep quiet while the Council is engaged in trying to solve the dispute. As pointed out above, the difficulty of getting the two parties to keep quiet is due to a feeling on the part of one that the other may have started in, or may be getting into, an advantageous position and that in consequence pre-cautionary measures must be taken. This difficulty can only be overcome through some outside body such as the Council in a
position to deal with each side impartially, being empowered to issue recommend at ions which will have to&apos; be obeyed.7. -The power given to the Council must be discretionary;it is impossible to fer-o-sea the circumstances ef the future and lay down in terms what the Council shall do;    but the moment a discretion is given to the Council the criticism ean bo made that some recommendation a night be issued from which this or that inconvenient result would follow. This means in effect that- the Council would issuci an unwise recommendation.      It Is a contingency that cannot be exclu-ded- altogether, but on the whole the risk of the Council issuing a-recommo-ndation which might endanger the safety of the state through preventing the taking of some wise defensive precaution aeeras less than the advantage te be gained by increasing the pewer of the Council to prevent the precipitation of a conflict.8. It may well be that some better phrase than &quot;maintain-&quot;ing or re-establishing the military statusimquo normally &quot;existing in time of peace&quot; can be found tn express the idea of keeping both parties quiet while the Council is engaged in Its werk.    It may be wiser not to attempt to express tho idea In .detail as is done in the German draft, but to run proposals 1 and  2 together and say that the parties shall agree tc abstain from any provocative action likely to precipitate a conflict,  and that whore action has been taken which the Council considers is likely to have that effect,  they will undo it.      This is much the same idea as that expressed on p.  10 of the rlolin Ja cquemyns memorandum; &quot;le Conseil doit done garder une large liberte d1 action,
&quot;non seulement en vuo do s* assurer quo las etats s&apos;abstien-&quot;nant de toute me sure roenacante ou pr oyc quant e, stain encore &quot;eventuellerner.it dans le sens du retablisscment du 1 statu &quot;&quot;110&apos;  qni oxlstait avar.it lrernpIoi de serablables mesures&quot;.The &quot;rapporteur&quot; has in fact seen the evils to which the German-proposal as worded might give rise and has tried to reshape it on sounder lines.9. The third German proposal deals with the case where war has actually broken out between the parties and provides frr the establishment of en armistice.The report of the&apos; Chiefs cx Staff lays stress on the immense difficulties ef a technical character in imposing an armistice by reason of the numerous subsidiary questions which must be settled in connection therewith.      The Rolin Jacquemyns memorandum points out that there are political difficulties as well as the technical difficulties involved.The truth is  that is hostilities had actually broken rut between two states,  an undertaking of&quot; the nature of this third German proposal would  only operate successfully if both states v/ere still anxious if possible to avoid a con-fliot,      Such a case would not happen often.    It happened in the- case of the Greco-Bulgarian conflict in 1925,  and the fact that it has occurred in recent times may be some justification for providing for It.      On the other hand when, it does happen,  the fact that both parties are anxious to avoid  a conflict renders it probable&apos;that they will accept the Council1s recommendations as Greece and Bulgaria did in 19S5 whether they are bound by any such agreement as the Germans propose or not.The difficulties of prescribing the details of an armistice are recognised in the Rolin Jar. luemyns memorandum.
It is for &quot;fehat reason that it is proposed that the parties should be given a specified period in which to agree between themselves upon the terms of an armistice;    the power of the Council to impose one if necessary being reserved. All that can be said in favour of this powar being given to the Council is that it might render the parties more prone to agree on the terms pf an armistice by direct negotiations.It must be remembered that the object of the Council would be merely to keep the contending forces apart while it was endeavouring to find a solution of the dispute   , which had led 10 hostilities.      All that was done in 1925 was       get the two parties to withdraw thoir forces so that they were no longer in contact.      No attempt was made t&apos;)&apos; settle any of the technical details to which the Chiefs of Staffs report draws attention,  and it is not clear that it would be necessary to do so.      If during the pnripd while it has been able to keep the contending forces apart,the Council can find a solution of the dispute, the measures which either party will have taken to strengthen its position in the meantime will make no diffErenco.10. The fourth German proposal deals -with  the questionpf unanimity.    The proposal is put forward in a very tentative way and as a matter f,or  consideration.    It must have been framed before the discussion at the February meeting of the Security Committee and is not likely to survive the criticism to which it has been exposed.      It must certainly be to the interest of H.M. Government to maintain the rule of unanimity;    at any rats to the extent prescribed in Article 1-5,  i.e.  that in dealing with a dispute the members of the Council other than the represen-tatives of the parties must be unanimous.
CHAPTER I. Preliminary statement.At the last session of the Committee on Arbitration and Security,&apos; the&apos; German Delegation submitted a series of suggest ions designed to strengthen the existing means of preventing war.According to the statements of M. von Simson,  the German delegate., his Governments proposal was that the League of Nations should use these suggestions in framing certain measures which would lead to an Increase In security &quot;by -strengthening mutual confidence,  and particularly by strengthening such confidence by methods which can be rapidly applied&quot;.Subsequently,  at its meeting on March 5th,  1928, the Committee on Arbitration and Security,  &quot;appreciating the great importance of these suggestions&quot;, adopted the following resolution, stating that it:&quot;Considers that they should be thoroughly examined and that Governments should be  enabled to study them in detail, and&quot;Decides to place them on the agenda of its next session and to appoint a Rapporteur, who will report to the Committee In the lierht of the Commit teeT s discussionsAPPENDIX TO ENCLOSURETranslat ion.

and of any observations which may be forwarded by Governments&quot;.Lastly,  at the close of its last session, the Committee on Arbitration and Security decided, more particularly under paragraph 3 &quot;to examine at its third session the suggestions of the German Delegation on the basis of the memorandum prepared by&quot; the undersigned Rapporteur.It may be well to reproduce the text of the above mentioned suggestions, numbered I to V:I. &quot;In case of a dispute being submitted to the- Council, the States might undertake in advance to accept and execute provisional recommendations of the Council for the purpose of preventing any aggravation or extension of the dispute and impeding any measures to be taken by the parties which might exercise an unfavourable reaction on the execution of the settlement to be proposed by the Council.II. &quot;In case of threat of war the States might undertake in advance to accept and to execute the recommendations of the Council to the effect of maintaining or re-establishing the military status quo normally existing in time of peace.III.    &quot;In the case of hostilities of any kind&apos; breaking out without, in the CouncilT s opinion, all possibilities of a pacific settlement having been exhausted, the States might undertake in advance to accept, on the Council&apos;s proposal, an armistice on land and sea and In the air, including especially the obligation of the two parties in dispute to withdraw the forces \?hich
3.might have penetrated into foreign territory and to secure the respect of the sovereignty of the other State.17*    &quot;The question should he considered whether the above-mentioned obligations should be under-taken only in case of a unanimous vote of the Council (the votes of the parties to the dispute not being counted), or whether the majority, simple or qualified-, might suffice in, the matter. Furthermore, it should be considered in what form the obligations would have to be drawn up In order to bring them into conformity with the Covenant.V.    &quot;These obligations might constitute the object of an agreement or of a protocol which would be open for signature by all States Members and non^Members of the League of Nations, and which might come into force separately for the several continents,  in a way similar to that provided for in the draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance of 1923.&quot;The suggestions reproduced above supplement the ideas put forward in the Observations submitted in January 1928 by the German Government&apos;on the programme of the work of the Committee on Arbitration and Security. (C.A.S.    10, pages 58 to 60). .,We would note more particularly the following passage in those Observations:
&quot;The duty of preventing a conflict between &quot;the States concerned from finally leading to &quot;recourse to arms is above all one for the Council, &quot;and It will be for the Committee to propose &quot;measures which will allow that body to intervene &quot;promptly and effectively to prevent threatened &quot;hostilities.      A careful investigation of the &quot;possibilities offered by Article 11 of the &quot;Covenant cannot fail to lead to a series of &quot;practical proposals.      These can be supplemented &quot;by special voluntary, undertakings going beyond &quot;the scope of the Covenant, undertakings which, &quot;even if not acceptable to all the Members of &quot;the League, can no doubt form the subject of &quot;an agreement between a large number of them. &quot;As an example may be quoted the provisions, &quot;agreed upon at Locarno, of Articles 4 and 5 of &quot;the Rhine Pact and those of Article 19 of the &quot;Arbitration Treaty, regarding certain recommend-&quot;at ions and proposals to be made by the Council &quot;of the Leagueo&quot;The idea underlying the suggestions which form the subject of the present Memorandum is therefore that special voluntary undertakings should be entered into by means of a general agreement, or at all events an agreement between a large number of parties.The arguments put forward by the German Delegate, M. von Slmson,  at the last session of the Committee., in support of these &quot;suggestions&quot; by the German Government, may be summed up as fellows:1.      In order that the action of the Council of the League of IT at ions may be exercised with increasing effect In the pacific settlement of international disputes, provision must be made for measures - which will prevent either party to the dispute from employing the delay Involved by such intervention to modify the status quo improperly in its own interests.      Accordingly &quot;conservatory measures&quot; of a purely provi sional character should be taken by the Council.
2.     In order to prevent a difference or dispute between States from leading to war between them, the Council of the League of Nations must be in a position to prevent the said States from making military preparations with this object, such preparations being of a nature to lead to 7var despite the pacific efforts of the responsible statesmen.3. The League of Nations must endeavour to stop armed conflicts, even when a state of war already exists, and this not only in the case of a war waged in violation of the Covenant but even in the case of a war not prohibited by the Covenant. Hence the first step to be considered must be an armistice, under clearly defined conditions.4.     The possibility might be considered whether the council  in the abdveHnentioned contingencies, should not take its decisions by majority vote, simple or qualified, as otherwise it might be unable to  take any action ?/whatever.5.     To increase the feeling of confidence, an essential factor in security, the measures proposed by the Counoil must be binding upon the parties,  in virtue of a general treaty or of collective treaties open to signature by all States,  including even those which are not Members of the League.The above is a summary of the considerations put forward during the discussions, in support of preventive measures for the more adequate maintenance of peace.In the following chapter the suggestions are examined individually from this standpoint.1
CHAPTER    II Observations on the suggestions submitted................ M..........   ....... i   i t*f ha.   ., i        i       - -iSuggestion No. h&quot;In case of a dispute being submitted to the Council, the States might undertake in advance to accept and execute provisional recommendations of the Council for the purpose of preventing any aggravation or extension of the dispute&apos;and impeding any measures to be taken by the parties which might exercise an unfavourable reaction in the execution of the settlement to be proposed by the Council..&quot; &apos;Suggestion Ho.  I aims at provisional measures touching the actual subject ox the dispute.      These closely resemble the system of &quot;conservatory measures&quot; found in a number of national Codes of civil procedure and in various systems of arbitration and conciliation procedure under international law.Host arbitration and conciliation treaties contain a provision requiring the parties, while the procedure is in progress, to refrain from certain acts which might &quot;prejudicially effect the execution of the award or the final prope sal,&quot;Furthermore,  the arbitration treaties confer on the arbitral court,  in the majority of cases, the right to order conservators7&quot; measures.      In the arbitration and conciliation treaties,  this power is generally conferred on the Conciliation Commission, especially as there is a growing tendency in conciliation procedure to recognise the Commissions proposals as binding.      The position is the same as regards the Council of the League when arbitration and conciliation treaties provide for its intervention In disputes.      Article 19 of the Locarno Treaties of Arbitration and Conciliation is a case in point.
\The German Delegation&apos;1 s first suggestion is simply a proposal to generalise this system of conservatory measures^  so that the actual principle is not likely to encounter opposition.Difficulties in the matter of application, however, may be anticipated,  since many States would undoubtedly refuse to assume undertakings conferring unlimited discretionary powers on the Council.     Accordingly, it might be expedient to limit the Councilrs powers inthe matter.      This would also facilitate agreement within the Council itself in regard to the conservatory measures it is entitled to propose.One way of thus limiting the powers of the Council or, more correctly, of conferring specific powers on it in this matter of conservatory measures, would obviously be to enumerate and define all the categories of conservatory measures that it might have to order.      But considering the extreme diversity cf cases that might arise and the differences in internal legislation, such a definition seems neither opportune nor feasible.     For this reason, none but general formulas have hitherto been adopted, the Arbitral Court, the Conciliation Committee or the Council being empowered at its discretion to define the measures in each particular case.
This would appear then to point to the advisability of conferring general powers on the Council in the matter of conservatory measures, particularly as it is the GouncilTs special function to intervene in political disputes, in which a definition or limitation of such measures is even more difficult than in legal disputes.Furthermore^ even In the absence of any exact statement or definition, the actual nature of the conservatory measures specifically limits their scope. They cannot in any case prejudice the fundamental issue.Accordingly,  adopting the suggestion to be found in Article 19 of the Locarno Treaties,  States might rely on the wisdom of the Council and recognise that it will only order such conservatory measures as are fair in themselves and really indispensable.If, however,  it were deemed advisable, especially ingeneral agreements, to limit the power conferred on theCouncil In the matter of conservatory measures in orderto relieve the anxiety of States unwilling to undertakeobligations not defined beforehand, use might be made ofthe following or other similar Indications:(a) For all questions generally left by international law tothe
exclusive jurisdiction of a State, the latter would retain its liberty Of action. &apos; For example, in the case of a serious dispute arising out of increases in the customs tariff (failing a commercial treaty)  or the expulsion of aliens, it would hardly be possible to place any restraint on a State in the regular exercise of its sovereign rights.(b) As a general rule^ no conservatory measures should be taken in regard to a State, save in the case of injury which cannot be made good by the payment of ordinary compensation or some other material form of reparation.    This principle appears to be generally accepted in international law, and was explicitly recognised quite recently by the Permanent Court of International Justice, in Judgment No.8 (Denunciation of the Treaty between Chins, and Belgium) .(c) Again,  it will have to be decided whether conservatory measures might be taken by the Council in the case of all disputes, or only if there is danger of war.    In this last eventuality the council s intervention would be of the first importance, and the prevention of war would seem to justify a greater restriction on the liberty of the parties.    Such restriction is however open to various objections which seem very difficult to overcome.    In the first place the conservatory measures would depend on one of the States parties -to the dispute adopting an uncompromising and threatening attitude calculated in. actual fact or in appearance to create the danger of war, whereas the same State should it adopt a more moderate and conciliatory tone would not secure the benefit of conservatory-measures.    Furthermore, it would be unfortunate
to confine conservatory measures to cases involving a danger of war, when there is every reason to hope that if such measures were taken in good time they might prevent that danger from arising.    Lastly, is it really desirable that the Council should be obliged, for the purposes of ordinary conservatory measures, to raise the very serious question of the danger threat of war?The Committee on Arbitration and Security will decide whether these various limitations are necessary.    It will be open to the Committee to adopt all of them in principle, or only one or more. Suggestion Ho.II.&quot;In case of threat of war the States might undertake in advance to accept and execute the recommendations of the Council to the effect of maintaining or re-establishing the military status quo normally existing in time of peace&quot;.It may perhaps be useful, in this connection^  to recall Article 12 of the Covenant of the League, which also deals with the threat of war, Members of the League agreeing more particularly &quot;in no case to resort to war until three months after the award by the arbitrators or the report by the Council&quot;.The second of the Geneva suggestions, relating to the question of the &quot;military status quo&quot;, appears to be based on the same principle.It is not the first time that this question has come before the League of Nations..   Apart from the Protocol of 1924, the work of the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference involved a protracted investigation into the status quo ante.      The results are incorporated in the Report of the
Committee of Three on iVrticle 11 of the Covenant-, approved by the Council on December 6th, 1927,  (Doo.0.169 .M.119..  1927 C.D.C.   67 (1).  ).The Report stages in paragraph III  (d), that &quot;The Council may take steps to see that the status quo ante is not disturbed in such manner as to aggravate or extend the dispute, and thus to compromise the pacific settlement thereof,,    Por this purpose It may indicate to the parties any movements of troops, mobilisation operations and other similar measures from which it recommends them to abstain.    Similar measures of an industrial, economic or financial nature may also be recommended&quot; oSub-paragraph (e)  reads;  &quot;In order to satisfy itself of the way In which these measures have been carried out and to keep itself Informed of the course of events, the Council may think it desirable to send representatives to the locality of the dispute&quot;.It seems impossible to define the measures to be taken more precisely beforehand.    The great diversity of cases, must preclude any attempt to Catalogue them, all in advance.    Accordingly, the Council should be left wide powers of auction not only in order to ensure that States shall abstain from all threatening or provocative acts, but also, if necessary, with a view to restoring the status quo existing before such measures were taken. In each particular case moreover, the Council will of course ask the opinion of its competent technical organs or of qualified experts.If this procedure were adopted, it would perhaps be possible to avoid certain disadvantages which a.ttach to the Councils intervention for the maintenance of the military -^ ^g-S^P. ,-an,tg f and c oo * o
which consist in consolidating the advantages of the State harbouring aggressive designs,    Sue-fa a State would, indeed, probably have been making particularly Intensive military preparations for some time pasteThe German suggestion appears to require supplementing in another direction, namely,, by some provision wherehy the Council should supervise the execution of any measures ordered, as proposed in the above-mentioned Report of the Committee of Three (ill  (e))r      A State would not he likely to undertake to execute measures of such gravity from the point of view of its national security, unless it were sure and possessed some guarantee that the other party to the dispute would also execute them in good faith and in their entirety.    These measures., which would be clearly defined and enforceable without delay, should of course always be suited to the individual case.gestion^Hoo III^&quot;In the case of hostilities of any kind breaking out without, in the Council&apos;s opinion,, all possibilities of a pacific settlement having &quot;been exhausted, the State might undertake in advance to accept, on the Council&apos;s proposal,  an armistice on land and sea and in the air, including especially the obligation of the two parti.es in dispute to withdraw the forces which might have penetrated Into foreign territory and to secure.the respect of the sovereignty of the other State&quot;.The idea that the Council might call upon the partiesto agree to an armistice after hostilities have broken outis to be found in the Geneva Protocal (Article 10)o    It was
taken up again by the French Delegation in the memorandum submitted, in 1926 to the Preparatory Disarmament Commission, and by M, Politis in his &quot;Memorandum on Security Questions&quot; (Of. Doc. O.A.S.  10o    paragraphs 79 and 96).In these documents, however, the main purpose was to facilitate the designation of the aggressorj    the idea accordingly formed part of the procedure respecting sanctions aThe German suggestion, on the other hand, would make the undertaking of the parties to accept an armistice primarily a link in the chain of preventive measures.-.Whatever the object In view^ the suggestion would undoubtedly be of very great value, both as a preventive measure and as one of the means by which the Council might subsequently determine the aggressor.The obligations in regard to the armistics should of course always Include, as the German Delegation suggested an obligation on. the parties to withdraw any forces which might have entered a foreign territory and to respect the sovereignty of the other State.But even under the simplest conditions,  the enforcing of an armistice Is bound to meet with considerable difficulties.As was mentioned at the second session of the Committee on Arbitration and Security, a State which had resolved to become an aggressor in violation of the Covenant
and any other undertakings would probably not be inclined to accept the Council&apos;s recommendations in regard to an armistice.Furthermore,  considering the variety of possible cases,  the duty of laying down equitable armistice conditions might involve the Council in a very difficult and -very delicate technical task.Accordingly,  as a solution of the difficulty, the Council might first take a preliminary decision stating that an armistice was necessary and ordering the parties to withdraw such of their forces as might have penetrated into foreign territory and to respect the sovereignty of the other State.      Those provisions might also apply to domilitarised zones, , in virtue of international agreements.    As regards the other conditions of the armistice, the Council would grant the parties a short time to come to a direct understanding and only if they failed to do so would it proceed itself to lay down the conditions, after consulting its technical organs or qualified experts.It seems unlikely that any State would openly refuse to accept the actual principle of an armistice and the principle that the territory and sovereignty of the other State should be respected.    The other armistice conditions, however, might easily lead to lengthy discussions and thus enable a State In certain circumstances to oppose a lengthy resistance to the Council&apos;s efforts.    If, on the other hand, the parties are given time to come to a direct understanding, the prospect of an agreement would ...00............
undoubtedly b  promoted by the knowledge that, in the event of failure, the Council would itself proceed to lay down the con-ditions and that an uncompromising; attitude would be bound to influence those conditions.Lastly, it should be noted that despite the considerable technical difficulties referred to the chief obstacle to the adoption of the suggestion for an armistice appears to be of -a political character.    It is doubtful whether, having regard to the existing international situation, States would&apos;be prepared to enter&apos; into such far-reaching undertakings. If so, this would undoubtedly constitute a very considerable guarantee of security.It is of course understood that in all the cases considered above,  the question of the supervision of the armistice conditions by the-council is just as important here as it is in the case of Suggestion ITo.II.Suggestion Nody&quot;.&quot;The question should be considered whether the &quot;above-mentioned obligation should be undertaken &quot;only in the case of a unanimous vote of tixe CouncS1 &quot;(the votes of the parties to the dispute not being &quot;counted), or whether the majority, simple, or &quot;qualified, might suffice in the matter.    Furthermore, &quot;it would be considered in what form the obligations &quot;would have to be drawn up in order to bring them &quot;into conformity with the Covenant&quot;.(a) Vote of the Council.The question of the simple or qualified majority vote of the Council brings us back to the difficulties encountered during the discussion on M. Politis&apos; Memorandum at the second session.    These led him to adopt the view of those delegates who maintained that the rule of unanimity should remain unchanged.
The dangers, however, are perhaps less serious in the present case.      The Council&apos;s decisions, it must be remembered, would never touch the fundamental issue in the dispute, but would he limited to preventing the parties from modifying the situation to their own advantage while the procedure is in progress, or from continuing hostilities.The Governments would have to. decide whether in these circumstances the idea of a majority vote might be considered.The majority vote undoubtedly possesses a very special importance in the case of measures which must be taken as rapidly as possible if they are to have the desired effect.    Accordingly, a mixed system might be feasible whereby the Council would normally comply with the rule of unanimity (naturally excluding the votes of representatives of the parties), an exception to this rule being allowed in the case of decisions in the nature of questions of procedure.      But how are such decisions to be defined?(b) Conformity with the CovenanttWhen studying the German suggestions from the point of view of conformity with the letter and spirit of the Covenant, it is important first to note that, to a considerable extent, the proposed convention is simply a confirmation of existing law.    As regards the first of the German suggestions, the provisions of the League Covenant v/ould appear to be comprehensive enough to empower the Council to recommend that the parties should take conservatory&apos;
S8measures.      As to the second and third of these suggestions, the Council, dh December 6th, 1987, adopted a Report concerning measures calculated to facilitate the application of Article 11 of the Covenant.      This report contemplates a series of similar measures designed mainly to arrest military preparations and even, up to a point, to enforce their suspension. A system of supervision was also included.The German suggestions, however, go even further.      The fundamental idea lies in the proposal that States should assume an explicit undertaking in advance to accept the CouncilTs recommendations.The usefulness of this proposal would appear in itself to admit of no dispute.      The establishment of a definite international undertakingmust undoubtedly strengthen the obligations assumed under the Covenant. The first effect would be to facilitate action by the Council and to increa.se its efficacy.    This is in keeping with the policy of those who insist on the progressive and  systematic development of preventive measures.From the standpoint of sanctions, equally valuable results might be anticipated.
A State that refused to obey a recommendation of the Council would place itself in a very serious position. It would be violating a definite and specific international undertaking, and would thereby provide the Council, as already shewn, with valuable evidence to be used when the / latter ca.nie to determine the aggressor, and,  if necessary, to set in motion the machinery of.sanctions.      This legal offence appearing among disputes of a purely political character would also assist the Council in its -work.But notwithstanding the undoubted advantages of adopting the German suggestions, it is obviously necessary to determine whether these agreements could exist side by side with the machinery of the Covenant,  or whether they would have to be drawn up in some particular form, with a view at least to this requirement.This point is referred to in the last  sentence of Suggestion No.IV.It raises,  in effect, the question whether the proposed system might not create difficulties as regards the application of the Covenant  of the League.      This difficulty does not appear likely to arise.     What would happen if a State actually violated undertakings of the nature contemplated in the German suggestion?      The matter would be brought before the Council in virtue of one of - the Articles of the Covenant,  - Article 11 in the first instance.     The Council would be in possession of additional evidence  (violence of an international obligation under the Convention in question) when deciding what arrangements
should be made ox- what measures should be adopted&apos;.      The normal working of the machinery of the Covenant, however, would not thereby be affected.Suggestion No.V.:&apos;These obligations might constitute the object of an agreement or of a protocol which would be open for signature by all States Members and non-Members of the league of Nations, and which might come into force separately for the several continents, in a way similar to that provided for in the draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance of 1923&quot;.The German Delegation suggests lastly that the obliga-tions of the States &quot;might constitute the object of an agreement or  of a protocol which would be open for signature by ail States Members and non-Members of the League of Nations.&quot;An agreement of so general a scope undoubtedly has much to recommend it.      Moreover, as several Delegates pointed out at the second session of the Committee on Arbitration and Security, the German suggestions could not be expected to give practical results of any importance unless they were accepted by a large number of States.      In other words, the efficacy of the agreements would depend essentially on the number of contracting parties.At the same time,  it must be borne in mind that important projects undertaken by the League have failed chiefly by reason of their general character.      Some States might feel doubtful whether their vast, numerous and varied interests would permit of their assuming a general under-taking in regard to all States without exception,&apos; even if
the undertaking appeared acceptable, or had already been accepted,  in regard to specific States.This difficulty also exists in the present case, as was amply demonstrated in the discussion at the second session of the Committee on Arbitration and Security.      It is of capital importance, as the general form of the undertaking to be entered into by States appears to be one of the essential features which distinguish the German suggestions from similar pro-visions contained in many special treaties.The German Delegation, however, has foreseen these objections and suggests that the general Agreement might come  into force separately for the several continents in a way similar to that provided for in the Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance of 1923.The provisions for the entry into force of this Treaty are as follows: -&quot;It  (the Treaty) shall come into force:&quot;In Europe when it shall have been ratified by five States,  of which three shall be permanently represented on the Council;&quot;In Asia when it shall have been ratified by two States, one of which shall be permanently represented on the Council;&quot;In North America when ratified by the United States of America;&quot;In Central America and the West Indies when ratified by one State In the West Indies and two in Central America;&quot;In South America when ratified by four States;&quot;In Africa and Oceania when ratified by two States.&quot;
ai -The legal and political difficulties of such a system appeared so great, however, that the Third Committee mentioned expressly in its Report to the Assembly on the Draft Treaty of 1923, that the text proposed was not a definite text but merely an indication &quot;of subject matter requiring further study by those Governments to which the Draft is submitted with a view to arriving at a satisfactory and definite result&quot;,.       -The question is thus seen to be both ,delicate and complicated *      It may be granted, however&apos;;, that the political difficulties will be less serious in the present case, which does not involve measures of mutual assistance, like the Draft of 1923, but simply provisional measures that do not touch the actual substance of the disputes, and can, moreover, failing a general agreement, be adopted in the form of regional pacts.The question of the signature of the proposed agreement by States non-Members of the league raises an even more, delicate political issue.      Prom the legal standpoint,  it does not appear to involve insurmountable difficulties, in view of the principles of the Covenant, more particularly Articles 11 and 17.
CHAPTER III ConclusionsFollowing on the account of the German suggestions and the observations thereon given in the preceding chapters, the Rapporteur has decided to summarise the questions of principle raised, questions in regard to which the.Committee on Arbitra-tion and Security might bo required to give a decision at its next session:With reference to Suggestion No.I.1.      Should the Council have power, in virtue of an agree-ment to be concluded between States, to lay down &quot;conservatory measures&quot; for the purpose of preventing any aggravation or ex-tenticn&apos;of a dispute between States?&quot;2.      Should such conservatory measures be left entirely to the discretion of the Council, or should the powers of the latter be restricted in conformity with the following principles, or with one or more of those principles?(a) In all questions left by international law to the exclusive jurisdiction of a State, the latter will retain its liberty of action  (e.g. Customs tariffs, expulsion of aliens);(b) Conservatory measures may not be ordered when satis-faction may be given for the injury by the payment of ordinary compensation or by some other national form of reparation.(c) The Council will only have power to take conservatory measures if there Is a danger of war.With reference to Suggestion No.II.1.      Should the Council have power, in virtue of an agreement to be concluded between States to order measures, when there is a danger of conflict between&apos;the said States, with
a view to maintaining or restoring between them the status quo ante in the matter of preparations for war?2o      Should the above rule relating to principle be supplemented in accordance with the following provisions repro-duded from Article III,   (d) and (g), of the Report on Article 11 of the Council, approved by the Council on December 6th 1927?(d) The Council &quot;may indicate to the parties any movements of troops, mobilisation operations and other similar measures from which it recommends them to abstain. Similar measures of an industrial, economic or financial nature may also be recommended;&quot;(e) &quot;In order to satisfy itself of the way in which those measures have been carried out and to keep itself informed of the course of events, the Council may think it desirable to send representatives to the locality of the d 1 spute o &quot;3.      Should the Council be given explicitly a. right of supervision in regard to the execution of measures prescribed with a view to restoring the status quo ante, and should it be granted entire freedom to adopt for this purpose measures clearly defined and of immediate application? With reference to Suggestion No0IIIo1.      Should the Council.have power,  in virtue of an agree-ment to be concluded between States, to order the Parties to accept&apos; an armistice when hostilities have broken out between the said States?2.      Should it be laid down that the Council will first order the Parties to withdraw any forces which may    havepene-trated into foreign territory and to respect the sovereignty of the other State, and that it will only proceed to fix the other conditions of the armistice  if the Parties fail to reach a direct agreement within a specified time?3,      Should the execution and observance of the armistice conditions be placed under the supervision of the Council?
With, reference to Suggestion NOoIY.1o      Should the Council resolutions concerning the cases mentioned in the above suggestions be adopted unanimously (not counting of course the votes of the representatives of the parties to the dispute), or would a majority vote,  simple or qualified, be admissible, at all events in certain cases?     If so, in what cases?2.     Would the CouncilTs action in virtue of the above-mentioned agreements between States be in conformity with the Covenant? *.With reference to Suggestion contingency.1.      Should the above-mentioned agreements take the form of an open protocol, or general or regional conventions,  or even separate agreements?2o      In each of the above-mentioned cases, could the agree-ments in question include States not Members of the League?3.      In the case of an open protocol or general convention, should this acme into force separately for the several continents in a manner similar to that provided for in the Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance of 1922?After a discussion on the above questions, the Committee will no doubt be able to frame proposals to be submitted to the next Assembly.

Copy No.   1^ *C.O.S. 167.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS.German Proposals for the Prevention of War. (Previous Paper No. C.O.S. 166.)REPORT.1. BY the direction of the Prime Minister, we have been given an opportunity to reconsider our report (Paper No. C.O.S. 160) on the German proposals for the Prevention of War in the light of the observations by Sir Cecil Hurst, based on a Memorandum submitted by M. Rolin^^quemyns, who is acting as &quot; rapporteur &quot; for the Security Committee at Genevapn this subject.2. We understand that the report of M. Rolin Jaequemyns and the observa-tions of Sir Cecil Hurst indicate the interpretations which may be put upon the German proposals. It is not for us to express any opinion as to whether these interpretations are legally correct or likely to be those which will be generally adopted. We are concerned only with the &quot;military reactions which may flow from the German proposals if adopted by the League of Nations. For this reason we feel that we can usefully examine only the actual text of these proposals or any definite modifications or amendments to this text which may be introduced at a later date as a result of the discussions on M. Rolin Jaequemyns&apos; report. We do not, therefore, wish to make any alterations to our original report.3. We feel, however, that it would not be inappropriate to take the present opportunity to point out that the German proposals are entirely in favour of a country which is centralised and free from outside observation and which has decided to challenge another to trial by war.. If these proposals are accepted, Germany, of all nations, would stand to gain most, while Great Britain would be placed in the most unfavourable position. Our traditional unpreparedness for war, with our forces (Naval, Army and Air) distributed all over the world, are forceful reasons why we should refuse them as we did the Geneva Protocol.Sir Cecil Hurst&apos;s paper assumes that it is safe for us to accept an agreement which is obviously favourable to Germany, but, in fact, this is the very reason why we should be very cautious. As time passes and Germany strengthens her military position these proposals will work more and more in her favour and to our disadvantage.The proposals may be considered as favouring also Russia and the United States pf America, two other highly centralised Powers, the former of which is particularly free from outside observation.   They would be very disadvantageous to France with.[17820]
her Army partly in Africa, and her navy based on two seas, joined only by the Straits of Gibraltar, where a naval concentration could be observed. Germany&apos;s two seas are connected by the Kiel Canal, which traverses German territory.Experience of previous pacts, e.g., those of Paris, The Hague and London, shows that they have worked to our disadvantage;  With this experience to guide us ,. we should be careful not to allow ourselves to be persuaded once again to endanger - our safety by accepting proposals to please other nations whose safety would in no way be jeopardised thereby.(Signed) H.

[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]Printed for the Comimittee of Imperial Defence.  June 1928.Enclosure IV.SECRET.C.O.S. 168.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.THE  GERMAN PROPOSALS FOR THE  PREVENTION OF  WAR.(Previous Paper No. C.O.S. 167.)REPORT.AT the request of Lord Salisbury&apos;s Committee on the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments, we met at 3 p.m-. on Thursday, the 21st June, as a matter of urgency to consider a re-draft by Sir Cecil Hurst of Clause III of the German Proposals for the Prevention of War, which deals with the imposition of an armistice. Sir Cecil Hurst attended our meeting.2.   The re-draft submitted to us for consideration reads as follows : &apos;&quot; In the case of hostilities of any kind breaking out without, in the CounciFs opinion, all possibilities of a pacific settlement having been exhausted, the States might undertake in advance to accept a recommendation by the Council to cease hostilities and to respect the territory and sovereignty of the other State.&quot;3. We are of the opinion that this re-draft is an improvement on the original text of the German proposals in that it avoids the use of the word &quot; armistice,&quot; which implies a simultaneous provisional settlement of a number of subsidiary questions, such as the procedure in regard to reinforcements or supplies on their way to the combatant forces, the movements of the forces themselves, &amp;c.4. Having regard to the fact that in no circumstances are we likely to be the aggressor, and that the clause, if accepted, will compel our opponent to evacuate any territory of ours which he may have invaded, and that we shall not be debarred from taking such steps as may be necessary for our national safety, such as the concentration of our Fleet and Air Forces, the mobilisation of our land forces and the production of essential war material, we feel that there is no grave risk in accepting the clause as re-drafted.5. In stating this we do not wish it to be thought that the formula is open to no objection or that it will always operate fairly. - Suppose, for example, that a dispute arises between France and Germany which eventually results in an outbreak of hostilities, Germany&apos;s first object would be to secure the bridges over the Rhine. If this were accomplished and Germany had gained this initial advan-tage, it would not be much comfort to France to know that Germany was complying with her undertaking with the League to cease hostilities and to respect French territory and sovereignty, for Germany could maintain her troops across the Rhine without infringing either. We have not had much time to explore the application of the formula in detail, but we have little doubt that other examples could be found where it would operate unevenly.6. We wish also to make it quite clear that we see no reason to modify in any way our views in regard to the original German proposals as set out in our Reports (Papers Nos. C.O.S. 160 and ^ 4(Signed) CHARLES E.  MADDEN (A.F.).G. F. MILNE. C. L. N. NEWALL(Air Commodore D.C.A.S. for C.A.S.).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, June 21, 1928. [17839]Copy No.137
