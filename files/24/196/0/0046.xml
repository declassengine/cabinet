&quot;i DCCTJi^KT 13 THE, PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOV^RNIiaNT.CABINET. INTERNATIONAL LABOUR  COHFj^NCE,    NINTH SESSION. Proposed action on draft convent ions and recommendations.&quot;VCRET Copy No. _iC,P.246(28) .MEMORANDUM 3Y THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.I submit for the consideration of my colleagues the following proposals which have been drawn up in consultation with the Board of Trade as to the action to be taken by the Government in regard to the draft conventions and recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference which was held at Geneva in June. 1926,     The texts of these documents have already been presented to Parliament as Command 2745, and the Report of the British Government Delegates was presented as Command 2750. Draft Convention concerning Seamen&apos;s Articles of Agreement.The main purpose of&quot;this Convention is to provide that the employment of seamen on merchant ship3 shall be governed by articles of agreement which shall be signed by the shipowner or his representative and by the seaman,  and that the agreement shall contain certain particulars,    With one exception, all the provisions of the Convention could be adopted in this country without any change in the existing law,    This exception is contained in Article 5, which provides that the document to be issued to every seaman, containing a record of his employment on board the vessel, shall not contain any statement as to the quality of the seaman&apos;s work.     The Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, provides (Section 129) that, where a seaman is discharged before a Superintendent, the Master shall make a report of the conduct, character and qualifications of the seaman, and the Superintendent/shall,
shall, if the seaman desires, give to him, or endorse on his certificate of discharge, a copy of that report,     In the very great majority of cases the report, known as the &quot;character&quot; report, has, for many years, been endorsed on the certificate of discharge as a matter of course, and it is very rarely that seamen exercise their option of refusing to have the &quot;character&quot; report entered on the discharge certificate.   This established practice is to the interest of men with good characters, who form the great majority, and is also in the interest of the owners, while it gives ample protection to the men who for any reason do not wish to have their character endorsed on their discharge books.The draft Convention, which in Article 14 gives seamen the right to have their &quot;character&quot; report on a separate document, but in Article 5 provid.es that the character may never be entered on the discharge certificate, would alter established practice in the British Mercantile Marine, and the necessary alterations would have to be made in the Merchant Shipping Act.The Shipping Federation, as representing Shipowners, and the National Union of Seamen have been consulted,  and have put forward a joint recommendation that His Majesty&apos;s Government should ratify the Gonvention with a reservation that the existing system of character reports in force in the United Kingdom should be maintained intact,I need not remind my colleagues that we have always refused to admit the possibility of ratifying draft labour conventions with reservations of this kind,    I should propose, therefore, to inform the International Labour Office of the attitude taken up by British shipowners and seamen and to aay hat His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to ratify the Convention but for this pi^provision which, in view of the preference shown by both sides of the industry for the existing syetem, it is not prepared to adopt./Draft
Draft Convention concerning the repatriation of seamen.This Draft Convention provides that seamen discharged outside their own country shall with certain exceptions he entitled to repatriation, it indicates the ports to which they are to be repatriated and it specifies the circumstances in which the coat of repatriation is not to be a charge on the seaman.   The general scope of the Draft Convention i3 approximately the same as that of the provisions of existing British lax? dealing with the repatriation of seamen;    but there are certain classes of seamen who are not. entitled to repatriation under existing British law but would be entitled to it under the provisions of the Draft Convention, and there are also certain classes of seamen already entitled to repatriation under British law to whom the Draft Convention does not apply.    In order to give effect in this country to the provisions of the Draft Convention it would be1 necessary to obtain legislation to provide for the repatriation, without cost to themselves, of seamen who are discharged at a British Overseas port otherwise than in accordance with the Agreement and without theii* fault or consent.   This would mean an extension of the provisions of Section 52 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906, which provides generally for the repatriation, of seamen discharged at a foreign port but does not extend, to discharge in any part of H.M.Dominions, It would also be necessary to provide for the repatriation of Colonial seamen engaged abroad and discharged in this country and of foreign seamen engaged in their own country and discharged in the United Kingdom.    The cost of repatriation in the majority of such cases would not, under the Convention, be chargeable to the seaman and the natural course would be to place the liability upon the shipowner concerned.    Following the existing provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts it would seem reasonable to make exceptions/in
in the case of a seaman left behind by reason of desertion or disappearanoe or imprisonment for misconduct, and the cost of repatriation in such cases would fall to be borne by the seaman himself or, If he were unable to meet it, would be a charge upon public funds,.The ratification of this Draft Convention would, therefore, place certain additional obligations upon British shipowners. These obligations would bp relatively lights but they would not be negligible, and British shipowners would be opposed to undertaking them unless similar obligations were at the same time Imposed upon their principal foreign competitors.   The adoption ofthe provisions of the Convention would also Impose, in certain cases,  additional charges upon the Board of Trad.e; but ratification of the Convention by the other principal maritime countries would relieve the Board, of the cost of repatriating British seamen discharged abroad after service in foreign ships, which in practice cannot, as a rule, be recovered from the shipowners concerned.    It is probable that on balance the Exchequer would gain rather than lose by the change.On merits there is a good case for the adoption of the provisions of the Convention since there is no good reason why a shipowner who engages a colonial or foreign seaman and leaves him in this country should be relieved of all further liability in respect of that -nan, nor is there any reason why a ship ottos r should not be liable for the repatriation of a seaman irregularly discharged at a British Overseas port.    It is accordingly proposed that H.i:i. Government should intimate that it is prepared to ratify this draft Convention as soon as at least six of the other principal maritime powers are also prepared to ratify. The inclusion of this proviso would, it is thought, meet the main objections to ratification both from the point of view of the Exchequer and from the point of view of British shipowners.
^ JL &amp;I would point out to my Colleagues that the BritishGovernment delegates voted/ in accordance with instructions, infavour of both these draft Conventions and that it would,therefore, be most unfortunate if we found it necessary to adopta purely negative attitud.e in regard to them-.Recommendation.concerning the repatriation of masters and apprentices&quot;^        &apos;This recommendation suggests that steps shall be taken to provide for the repatriation of masters and apprentices who are not covered by the Draft Convention on the repatriation of seamen.The provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts relating to the repatriation of seamen apply equally to apprentices.    Those provisions which relate to the repatriation of seamen left behind abroad by reason of sickness or injury also apply to Masters, The other provisions concerning repatriation do not so apply,, but,, the question of introducing legislation to extend them to Masters will be considered when a suitable opportunity arises,  and it i3 proposed to inform the Secretary-General of the League of Nations accordingly.Reoominendation conoerning the general principles for the inspection of&apos;&apos;the&quot;concli&apos;tTbna of work&apos; of seamen.This recommendation indicates certain general methods for the organisation  of inopootion, recommends the publication of annual reports of the inspection authorities, and suggests the rights, powtore and duties of inspectors,The general principles laid down in the recommendation are already given effect to in this country,  and it Is proposed to inform the Secretary-General of the League of Nations that li,!&apos;:.,Government accept the recommendation,(Intd.)
