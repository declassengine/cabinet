[This Document is the Property oi His Britannic Majesty^ Goverrumest.]Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1928.CONFIDENTIAL.O.P. 214 (28).TREATY FOR THE RENUNCIATION OF WAR.2iCorrespondence with Sir C. Hurst in regard to certain points arising out of theUnited States Note of June 23, 1928.Circulated to Cabinet by direction of Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.[A 4282/1/45] No. 1.Sir Austen Chamberlain to Consul London (Geneva).(No. 46.)(Telegraphic) Foreign Office, June 26,1928.FOLLOWING for Sir C. Hurst from Mr. Malkin :-&quot; My letter of 25th.&quot; Secretary of State held meeting this afternoon to discuss Kellogg note-Result was to confirm importance of meaning to be attached to new third paragraph of preamble.&quot; Wider interpretation (a) covers warlike action under article 16 against a signatory who has attacked a non-signatory member of League, and (&amp;) allows us, without losing benefits of treaty, to defend any country in which we have special interests (not being a signatory) against attack by signatory. It is not clear that it (c) allows us to defend such countries against attack by non-signatory, since no signatory would have gone to war before we did. It might also debar us from (d) assisting a Power which had, without violating Kellogg; treaty, gone to war under gap in Covenant, or (e) from intervening in a war between two non-signatory and non-League Powers. It would (/) only allow us to take warlike action under article 16 against a non-signatory if such action were not regarded as &apos; seeking to promote our national interests by resort to war.&apos;&quot; Narrower interpretation would not cover (a) or (b), but does cover (c), (d), (e) and (/).&quot; Neither interpretation is thus wholly satisfactory, though wider seems preferable. I suggested that nearly all our points would be substantially met if we could insert in new paragraph words taken from proposed article which we discussed the other day, so that it ran &apos; and that any signatory Power which shall hereafter seek to promote its national interests by resort to war, in disregard either of the provisions of this treaty or of its obligations under any other treaty or international agreement which is binding upon it, should be denied,&apos; &amp;c. This addition is obviously defensible argumentatively. It covers (a), unless attacking Power were not a member of the League. It would cover (b) if attacking PoAver were a member of the League, and we could arrange that attacked country should accept membership and comply with Covenant. It would give us liberty of action under (c), (d), (e) and (/).&quot; Under none of these three alternatives does point under articles 42-44 seem to be covered, but we think we can leave this to France and Belgium.&quot; Would you consider above, and if you think my suggestion useful discuss it with your French and German colleagues ? In any case, please telegraph result of your discussions with them.&quot; We are still considering whether, whatever wording be adopted for preamble, we want anything further to safeguard our Monroe doctrine, especially as regards Egypt. There is a feeling that we want to keep a free hand to deal with action, whether internal or external, which would not amount to war, but might undermine our position as regards reserved points. Do you think it would suffice if, without making any reservation or unilateral declaration, we embodied in our reply a reaffirmation of 1922 declaration, sent copies to all the proposed signatories, and inserted something to try to ensure that Powers which acceded later should be deemed to have notice of our statement and to come inon that footing ? &apos;&apos;__4506   [17898] b
2f A 4479/1/45] No; 2. , .   ;Sir C. Hurst to Sir Austen Chamberlain. [Received July 2.)(No. 3.) Hotel Beau Rivage,Sir, Geneva, June 29,1928.THROUGHOUT the period during which the Security Committee has been in session M. Fromageot and I have been engaged whenever possible in discussing the American note of the 23rd June and the revised draft of the proposed Peace Pact. This afternoon, in order to bring our discussions to a more definite point, I gave M.. Fromageot the enclosed memorandum, containing my appreciation of the conclusions we had reached. He is now studying its terms and to-morrow I hope that we may be able to draft a joint memorandum.I have, &amp;c.CECIL J. B. HURST.Enclosure in No. 2. Peace Pact.THE terms of the concluding paragraphs of the American note of the 23rd June show very little indication of a willingness to discuss modifications in the text of either the preamble or the treaty. The Powers are merely asked to indicate whether they are willing to sign a treaty in those terms.2. M. Fromageot discussed with me on the 27th June the French proposal now made to the Foreign Office and the other Governments concerned for a protocol to be signed by all parties other than the United States, safeguarding the situation as regards obligations under the Covenant and other treaties. I told him that politically I thought the scheme open to great objection. One of the chief advantages of this Peace Pact is that it will mark the beginning of the end of the regime of isolation of the United States. The parties will at least all be contracting the same engagements. American co-operation would be discouraged by learning that the other Powers thought it necessary to arrange special terms operative only between themselves. M. Fromageot has also warned his Government that even if the system were adopted, the provisions of the special protocol would not be operative as against the United States. The engagements which each contracting Power takes under article 1 towards the United States would not be affected by the contents of the protocol.The purpose of the French Government might perhaps be achieved without incurring the risks indicated above, by means of appropriate statements made by a plenipotentiary at the moment of signature setting out the understanding on which the treaty was being signed, such statements being incorporated in the minutes of the meeting at which signature took place. These statements could not, of course, over-ride the provisions of the treaty, but would serve to show the meaning to be given to provisions which were vague or doubtful. Such a procedure would have to be concurred in by the Americans.3. In its present form the renunciation of war embodied in article 1 can only be reconciled with the obligations incumbent upon States members of the League under article 16 of the Covenant, by placing on the provision in paragraph 3 of the preamble the wider interpretation indicated in the Malkin telegram of the 26th June. This interpretation is not the only one which the passage is capable of bearing, and it is difficult to reconcile with the words at the end of article 1 by which the parties renounce war as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another. It would be difficult to induce any international tribunal to hold that a stipulation in the preamble could override the plain language of one of the operative clauses. Furthermore, so long as the words in question remain in the text of article 1, it seems illogical to proclaim in the preamble that a party should be deprived of the benefits of the treaty on account of action which involves no violation of its terms. The new provision has only been inserted in the preamble for the purpose of making it plain that breach of the treaty by one party should free the Others from their obligations.4. The six hypotheses set out in the Malkin telegram differ greatly in import-ance. No. 1 overshadows the remainder. Both the British and German notes have made it clear that respect for the Covenants of the League is a fundamental principle
of the policy of those two Governments. The section of the public which is most insistent on the acceptance of the Peace Pact would be the first to turn against the Government if the Peace Pact were accepted in terms which excluded the loyal fulfilment of the obligations of the Covenant. If the Peace Pact were accepted in its present terms by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and a party to the Peace Pact attacked a non-party who was a member of the League, the right of His Majesty&apos;s Government to implement the stipulations of article 16 by belligerent action would depend upon the wider interpretation of the provision in the preamble obtaining universal acceptance. For His Majesty&apos;s Government to accept it in the absence of general acceptance would only be to run the risk of future misunderstandings which might endanger friendly relations and undermine the League.5. Before any reply to the American note is prepared it would be Avell to put to the United States Government the question whether they concur in the wider interpretation of the provision in the preamble, and, if not, in what way it is possible for a member of the League who accepts the Peace Pact to fulfil his duties under article 16 in case of an attack by a signatory against a non-signatory who is a member of the League. If the American Government accepts the wider interpretation of the provision in the preamble, the last, six words of article 1 should be struck out.6. Even if amendments to the text now proposed can be secured, the additional phrase which the Malkin telegram proposes to add to the third paragraph of the preamble is likely to be unacceptable to the United States and to all those who hope that the pact would effect an appreciable limitation of the risks of war, because it introduces the element of the unknown. It legalises war in cases which cannot be clearly defined. Though it is perfectly sound from the juridical point of view, it is a question whether a wiser course would not be to word the amendment so as to legalise the right to go to war in support of another State only in cases where that State is the victim of an attack, thereby restricting any engagements to gO&apos; to war in support of another State. This is what France did in respect of Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1925.7. The passage in the American note numbered &quot;2, The League Covenant,&quot; reproducing Mr. Kellogg&apos;s speech of the 28th April, is inaccurate and misleading. It is essential to understand precisely how the Peace Pact will affect the Covenant. There are two classes of cases in which war is legitimate under the Covenant. The first class is where a member of the League resorts to war to uphold the covenants of the League, i.e., war for the purpose of coercing a Covenant-breaker. The second class is where a State is at liberty individually to- make war without violating, the Covenant.The right to make war in the first class of cases is one which must be safeguarded.. Concerted coercion for upholding the covenants of the League is the essence of the method by which the League endeavours to ensure peace. Starting from the principle that no one State can be so strong as the remaining States acting together, the League system endeavours to ensure the maintenance of peace by the simple method of ensuring the defeat of the State which resorts to war in defiance of its covenants. It will not be to the interest of any State to resort to war when the only effect will be to incur defeat. The passage in the American note : &quot; The Covenant can, it is true, be construed as authorising war in certain circumstances, but it is an authorisation and not a positive requirement,&quot; is no sufficient justification for a State renouncing the right to make war altogether. If it did so renounce the right to make war, it could not make use of the liberty it now enjoys, amounting to a moral obligation, to join in coercing the Covenant-breaker.The second class of cases, i.e., those where war is permissible under the Covenant under paragraphs 15 (6), 15 (7). and 15 (8), are cases where a State by accepting the new Peace Pact will, restrict the liberties which the Covenant now gives it. War in such cases might be made &quot; for the purpose of promoting the national interests,&quot; and where that was the case it would fall within the renunciation clause of the Peace fact. The important case is action under article 15 (7), where a State is at liberty to make war if the Council is unable to arrive at a unanimous conclusion, but cases where war may be necessary because the other party to the dispute refuses to comply with the unanimous recommendations of the Council, or where the subject-matter of the dispute relates to domestic concerns of the other party on which the Council can make no recommendation, are cases which must not be left out of account. The acceptance of the Kellogg Pact implies that in these cases, instead of making war on its own account, a State wall trust for a solution of the dispute to, the force of the. combined public opinion of the world and to the moral pressure which can be exercised without resort to war.[17898] b 2
8. The British note of the 19th May indicated three points upon which the situation required to be clear. The first was that a breach of the obligations embodied in the Peace Pact by one State must release the other parties from their obligations towards that State. The second was that commitments under the Covenant and under the Treaty of Locarno must be safeguarded. The third was that in the areas in which Great Britain had special interests, liberty of action must be preserved to safeguard those vital interests.The first point is met by the new wording introduced into the preamble. Whether that passage is to bear the narrower or the wider interpretation, it covers this point satisfactorily, provided that it is made clear that the principles laid down in the preamble constitute the conditions on which the pact is concluded.The effect which the new Peace Pact will have upon the Covenant is dealt with in paragraph 7 above. Except as regards one point which is dealt with below (that of the right of His Majesty&apos;s Government to take action in case of a flagrant violation by Germany of her undertakings in regard to the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland), the commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government under the Locarno Treaty are safeguarded by the fact that all the parties to the Locarno Treaty will be parties to the new Peace Pact. Before His Majesty&apos;s Government can be called upon to implement the undertakings in that treaty, there will have been a resort to war by some other State which will free His Majesty&apos;s Government from the restrictions imposed by the Peace Pact.No attempt is made in the American note to meet the point as to the areas in which   Great  Britain  has  special  interests which  she  is  bound  to &apos; defend. Mr. Kellogg&apos;s attitude has been made clear by the telegram in which he asked why Great Britain should not have a Monroe Doctrine as much as the United States. The silence on this point in the American note is a clear indication that the United States would not be willing to introduce into the text of the Peace Pact any reference to this point at all.   The only course open to His Majesty&apos;s Government seems to be j to make a definite pronouncement on some appropriate occasion, such as the reply to \ the new American note or at the moment of the signature of the Peace Pact, thatJ they do not regard the terms of the instrument they are accepting as excluding their right to maintain and enforce the policy which they have declared in regard to these special areas,./ -That with regard to Egypt was notified to all the Powers in the note of the 15th March, 1922. No one would be asked to accept this statement; they would be left to object to it if they thought it necessary to do so.   No State is likely to do so, least of all the United States, as they have their own Monroe Doctrine to consider.The terms in which Mr. Kellogg has dealt with the question of self-defence in the speech which is reproduced in the note of the 23rd June, give an opening to His i Majesty&apos;s Government to deal with this question of their special interests in certain areas on lines which will fully protect&apos; them. The necessity of preserving the interests in these special areas is comparable to measures of self-defence, and Mr. Kellogg has recognised that each State alone is competent to decide whether circumstances require recourse to war in self-defence. If it has a good case the world will applaud and not condemn its action. Public opinion realises that the special interest of Great Britain in Egypt is due to the vital need of keeping open the lines of communication between the different parts of the Empire, and even if the purists might dilate on the differences between self-defence and the preservation of vital communications, public opinion would appreciate that action was as necessary in one case as in the other. The position is helped by the tendency shown in the new paragraphs of the preamble to treat the Peace Pact as excluding changes in the relations between States by other than peaceful means.9. There is nothing in the new text of the Peace Pact which safeguards the French position with regard to articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles. Any violation by Germany of those articles is characterised by article 44 as &quot;a hostilei act,&quot; but need not necessarily amount to a resort to war. Consequently Germany might violate those articles without violating the Peace Pact. Though the interest in this point is primarily French, it is also a matter of concern to Great Britain, J because if the violation is flagrant and recognised as such by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound under the Treaty of Locarno to come to France&apos;s help without waiting for the decision of the Council of the League.Fundamentally the necessity for France to take action in case of a flagrant violation of articles 42 and 43 is in the nature of a measure of self-defence, but public opinion in France might hesitate to accept Mr. Kellogg&apos;s statements about self- j defence as sufficient to maintain in full vierour their rights under article 44 of the I
Treaty of Versailles. It is also doubtful whether public opinion in Great Britain would regard the maintenance of the demilitarisation of the Rhineland as a measure of self-defence. This question of articles 42, 43 and 44 of the Treaty of Versailles is, therefore, one of great difficulty. M. Fromageot&apos;s view is that one way of dealing with the point would be to secure the addition of some words to paragraph 2 of the preamble, such as &quot;notamment en conformite des traites existants &quot; after the word &quot;relations,&quot; and if that should be found to be impossible, to explain the situation in the note on lines analogous to those suggested in paragraph 8 above, or in a declaration to be made at the moment of signature.10. Of the six hypotheses dealt with in the Malkin telegram of the 26th June, the first has been dealt with in paragraph 7 above. The second and third relate to the defence of the British position in the areas where Great Britain has special interests. If His Majesty&apos;s Government make it clear that they do not regard the new Peace Pact as excluding the maintenance of their present policy with regard to such areas, no difficulty will be caused whichever interpretation is adopted of the third paragraph of the preamble, even if no change is made in the text. As regards the fourth and fifth cases, His Majesty&apos;s Government are under no obligation to go to the support of a State which goes to war under the gap in the Covenant, or which, not being a member of the League, goes to war with another non-member. If Great Britain felt it necessary to do so, it would almost certainly be a case where such action had been recommended by the Council of the League. If the Peace Pact comes into force, most of the States represented on the Council of the League will be parties to it, and if the Council of the League recommends action which appears to be inconsistent with the Peace Pact, it implies a willingness on the part of most of the parties to the pact to make a temporary derogation from its terms. The same applies to the sixth case. The League has moved appreciably during the last few years in the direction of increasing the extent to which the Council will be the body to recommend action taken under article 16, and if in any particular case the Council thinks fit to recommend warlike action under article 16 by the parties to the Peace Pact against a State which is not a party to it, it certainly implies a recognition on their part that the circumstances are not such as to involve a resort to war by the members of the League &quot;as an instrument of national policy.&quot;June 29, 1928.o
