THE APPEAL.TO. EMPLOYSRS.6.      We think it important to proceed at once with the appeal (as proposed in the Industrial Transference board Report) to employers generally throughout the country each to agree to give employment to a man or a hoy (or more, if he can) from the depressed areas.     The stages of this are(1) Publication of the Report of the industrial transference Boards (2) Pull press support for the appeal - they are ready to give it, (3) Statement in the House of Commons of the Government&apos;s backing of the appeal (with particulars of the special travelling facilities which the Government have authorised). (4) Issue of a letter - signed by the PrimeMinister - to employers selected in each area by the Employment Exchange, asking for practical effect to be given to the appeal by agreeing to give employment to one cr two men o(5) Follow-up of the letter in each area by the Employment Exchange officials with a view to persuading the employer to play his part. The Prime Minister1s letter might be on the following lines :-10, DOWNING STREET, S.Wol*August,  1928.Sir,INDUSTRIAL^TRANSFERENCE BOARD. You will no doubt have noticed the Press references to the Report of the;Industrial Transference Board dealing
9 7s?with the conditions of severe unemployment in the depressed areas and with the steps that can he taken to transfer the men to other work in other areas. The Report shows that., while the Government can help to some extent by providing - as they are doing -training and travelling facilities, the main contri-bution to the solution of the problem lies in a widespread response by employers to the suggestion that each one who possibly can should offer employment to one or two of the men from these areas.      On behalf of the Government an appeal has since been made to employers on these mines, and I now venture to ask for the practical support of your firm.     I feel confident that it is unnecessary for me to emphasise to you the importance, both from the national and the local point of view, of doing everything possible to effect the transfer of these men,     At the same time the experience of a number of employers (including representative employers who attach the greatest importance to efficiency In their workpeople) who have taken on some of these men shows that they have a real value *If, as I hope may be the case, I can count both upon your sympathy and your practical help, I shall be glad, to arrange for a representative of the Ministry of Labour., to come and discuss the matter with you if you will sign and return the attached notice.Yours faithfully,STANLEY BALDWIN.
AMALGAMATIONS,7.        we recommend that if a projected aj^sxigamation in the coals iron and steel, or notton industry is approved &quot;by the Government , hut cannot he brought to fruition owing to an inability to raise necessary capital in the- ordinary way, the Government should obtain power, on suitable conditions, to afford, such guarantee as will enable the capital to bo raised? An Act of Parliament would be necessary for the purpose specifying the conditions in which the guarantee could be. given.   Apart from the general limitations stated above, these conditions should include provisions to tho effect that the combining concerns would leave all their assets In the combined businesss that the creditors should acquire no greater advantages than would accrue to them under a sound business arrangement without Government participation and that the new capital should be raised exclusively as wording capital and for development.    A small but very strong Committee, similar to the Trade Facilities Committee3 should be set up to examine applications, to ensure that tho conditions are   satiafied, and to report whether the schemes of amalgamation are such as can be approved by His Majesty1 s Governments8. The promise of this aid after parliamentary sanction Las been obtained in the autumn might easily defeat the object in view by delaying the formation of amalgamations now contemplated unless the amount to be guaranteed is strictly limited and a time limit fixed within which schemes have to bo submitted in order to encourage the immediate development of planso The amount required should not be great as in most
cases amalgamation., and even reconstruction schemes, do not involve any very large demand for new capital though they may well involve large reductions in writing off oi capital.    On the other hand, where a guaranteed loan is available the tendency must be that the dead wood will not be ci.it away aS drastically as if Che combine had to fend for itself in the open market.    The existence of a strong Committee should help to prevent this but the tendency is a further reason for a strict limitation of the total amount of Government credit to be made available^ lastly, the issue of guaranteed loans necessarily tends to depress Government credit, and It is likely to have a particularly serious effect in tho immediate future, owing to the large amount of capital borrowing to which the Government is committed already (local Loan33 Unemployment Fund and Telephone) and the fallings off in the resources from which these borrowings have recently been financed.    It is desirable, therefore, to take all possible steps to minimise the effect on market sentiment of the proposed issue.   For all these reasons9  it appears to us that the aggregate sum that the Government may guarantee should from the outset be fixed and we recommend that it should not exceed  10 millions^
EXPORT CREDITS GUARANTEE SCHEMA,90      The Export Credits Guarantee Scheme will come to an end in September, 1929, failing fresh legislation to prolong it0Since the end of the coal stoppage the operations of the scheme have expanded very greatly and the Estimates Committee recently conducted  (in their own words) &quot;a searching investigation&quot; into the scheme and were satisfied that it was of great practical advantage to the export trade of the country and that the recent expansion was sufficient proof of this necessity.     We have therefore no hesitation in recommending that the scheme should he extended for a further period of two years from September,  1929.The Estimates Committee recommend an expert investigation into the administrative expenses of the Department and we think that the Government-s intention to set up such an enquiry should be announced at the same time as the extension of the life of the. scheme.
EOT;NSION Off ADULT TRAINING CENTRE SYSTEM.,,10.   We suggest also the acceptance of therecommendations of the Industrial Transference board that the Ministry of Labour centres - now four in number and providing training for 3,500 young men perannum - for giving young unemployed men from thedepressed areas training in a new trade should beextended to the fullest extent justifiable by theprospect of a reasonable degree of successfulplacing at the end of the training period.     Thespecial efforts made by the Employment Exchangeservice to secure openings for these men when they are be trained should/continued,,      (Note: The present cost of these centres is about  130,000 per annum.      It is not anticipated that any considerable Increase over this sum will be required,)
11c As part of the governmentrs plan we proposethat it should be stated that we are prepared fas  . advised by the Industrial Transference Board) to increase, as may be necessary, the centres established to give training to unemployed boys in the depressed areas and to continue the special efforts now being made by the Ministry of labour to find employment for the boys In other parts of the country.      These efforts (with which are combined special arrangements for enabling the boys to travel to their new areas and to get outfits where necessary) are already resulting in considerable movement and we advise their--continuance and extension.   We are disappointed to learn-that in areas where the Local Education Authority are responsible for juvenile employment questions, very little help has been given,up to the present,by way of finding vacancies for these boys;     we think this matter should be examined by the Ministry of Labour in association with the Board of Education, with a view to an effort being made to induce the Education Authorities to achieve results commensurate with the size of their areas and the opportunities existing there.(Note: The present cost of these Centres is about  60^000 per annum. It Is not anticipated that any considerable increase over this sum will be required.
12.    We think it important that the Sovera-mentrs plan should include an element of settlement on the land in this country.      The Industrial Transference Board do not propose the ordinary type of small holding (which is very expensive) hut they advise the acceleration-tion of the plans of the Forestry Commission so as to provide within, say, the next three years not less than 1,000 Fore3t Holdings for&apos; miners.     This is a most attractive form of land settlement and as each holding means the permanent settlement of a whole family (with an assured livelihood upon forestry work), and has the additional merit of dealing with the most difficult class of all - the older married men, we suggest the adoption of the - Industrial Transference Board recommendation and ws propose that the Forestry Commission he instructed to make any necessary changes in the ir programme.
REPORT Qg MIGRATION SUBrCpM^ITgBE.SUMMARY of PRTNOTPAL REG OMvPSFJ) AT IONS.13.       The following are the principal conclusions and. recommendations contained in the Report (See Appendix]of the Migration Sub-Gommittee:-(l) The Subcommittee entirely agree with .the Industrial Transference Board as to tho necessity for simplifying migration procedure and dispensing with non essential formalitloo and restrictions, and recommend that this Question which they regard, as of primary and urgent importance should be at once taken up with .   the Dominion Governments.    (Paragraph 4).(Z) A scheme for the reduction of passagerates should, not discriminate on the ground of destitution, but there should be a uniform reduced rate of which any reputable British subject should be eligible to take advantage (Paragraph 5)*(3)    The negotiations between the British . Government and the Shipping Companies should be directed to securing that the Canadian standard Third Class passage rate should, during tho emergency period of the next three to five years, be reduced in the case of British subjects to a figure as near  10 as possible (Paragraph 8).(4)    In the case of any intending migrantwho is a&apos;this to satisfy the competent Authority In Great Britain -(a.) that he cannot migrate without financial assistance;(b) that it is reasonable that he should seek work: overseas and that he is likely to make a good settlerarrangements should be made for the advance to him of a free ticket,  outfit, landing money, etc. up to such amount not exceeding  E5 in value (assuming a standard fare of  10). as may be recommended by the competent Authority.   Arrangements should be made In Canada under which the shipping and/or railway companies would undertake to do their best to recover the advances on the basis of a small commission (Paragraph 11).
(5)    It is essential that an agreement should he reached with the Canadian Government that that Goveroiment    (1) will not regard the above arrangements as rcharity mlgrationT or treat the persons taking advantage of the scheme as  1 assisted migrants1 and will therefore not treat the men a3 prohibited migrants, and (2) will not raise the present  &quot;landing rater of 20 dollars a head in the case of British migrants without previous consultation with the British Government, (paragraph 12)a(6)     As regards Australia a substantial increase in the number of 1 requisitions1 is needed,, The conditions of entrance to Australia should&quot;be intelligible and fixed, the procedure easy, and the policy stable over a period of years     These and other considerations raised in paragraph 120 and elsewhere in the Report of the Industrial Transferonco Board should be vigorously taken up with the Australian authoritiesoAfter a bettor understanding has been reached with the Australian Authorities negotiations should &quot;bo undertaken with the shipping companies with a view to securing a substantial reduction of the ordinary Australian passage ratos  (Paragraph 14).(7)     The proposals of the Oversea Settlement Committee for the annual training at home and settlement overseas of 2S5Q0 boys9 7*000 single men, 2P50G families and 2 .,000 single women at a total not cost estimated at  60.3.9300 a year should be accepted on the understanding that in the case of&apos;tho scheme for the annual recraltments training and migration of 2,000 single women every effort will be made to secure a lominion contribution towards the estimated cost    ( 59,600 per annum) equivalent in amount to tnat made by the British Government,    (paragraph 16).(0)     acceptance of tho Land Settlement LoanScheme is recommended on condition that the - scheme is placed on a pound for pound basis, ioOo that tho British Govomment loan of a hundred pounds is equated by a contribution of liko amount from some Canadian sourcea (Paragi-aph 18),
Q i(9) Acceptance of the proposal that   not less than 5G0C^t$ou.l4 bo seat in August next to work as harvesters In Canada is recommended.   &apos;(paragraph 19).(10) The Sub-Committee recommend that the representative of the British Government should be authorised to enter into negotiations with the Canadian Authorities with a view to securing the reservation in certain -undeveloped districts, of areas of land for British settlers^    The negotiations to proceed upon the basis that the British Government are willing to make arrangements with existing organisationss such as the Provincial Governments9 the Canadian Pacific Eailway or the Hudson1s Bay Company0 for Jointly financing development schemes by which British migrants may be employed and settledo    [paragraph 20)o(11) The Sub^-Committee also recommend&apos; that the Treasury aa the competent authority should be requested to undertake an Inquiry forthwith into the whole question of the administration of migration in Great Britain and should submit recommendations to the Prime Minister with as little delay as possibleo (paragraph El).2 Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1, 20th July,  1928.

MIGRATION SU3-0OMMITTBE.Inter-^ ^ Report.1.        At their Meeting on July 10th 1928, the &quot;Unemployment Policy Committee Invited a Sub-Committee composed of The Secretary of State for War    (In the Chair) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs The Secretary of State for Scotland The Minister of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries The Minister of labour te examine and report on the migration proposals referred to the Committee.    The Lend Privy Seal subsequently joined the Sub-Committee.2.      &apos; We have examined the following proposals -fa) The reeommera3.ations respecting migration contained in the Report of the Industrial Transference Board.(b) The Minister of Labour^ suggestion in U.P.(28) 3  (in accordance with the Report of the Industrial Transference Board) that the migration of all-classes of workers including miners should be stimulated by a substantial reduction Qf ordinary passage rates outside the Empire Settlement Act, i*e. without calling upon the Dominion Governments to contribute te that general reduction.&apos;.(cs) The proposals of the Oversea Settlement Committee contained In CP,198 (28) for settling overseas each year about 213.500 persons from-the distressed mining areas,including&apos;&apos; proposals- for land development and loans for adult&quot; settlers..
0 0s)The Beoommend&amp;tl-ona of the Industrial Txaiisf6jcen.ee Board.3. In the concluding paragraphs t  their Report theBoard, after emphasising the finances of absorption in the Dominions for large numbers of productive workers, expressing regret at the disappointingly slow rate of British settlement in Australia and Canada, notwithstanding the passage of the Empire Settlement Act of 1988? and drawing attention to the need for putting the policy o  Empire Settlement agreed up*n at successive Imperial.. Conferences, into really effective force, recommend a.m follows -&quot;Migration procedure is highly complicated, and  ormaXIties are numerous and restrictive,. We are satisfied that they constitute a real discouragement to potential settlers. Nothing can be more vital or urgent than the need for a radical simplification **f all this.Farther - to facilitate settlement apart from the Empire Settlement Act - there should be a reduction of the passage rates more nearly to the, pra-war level.    Something more than this is/needed In the present abnormal conditions here.   Even with lower passage rates there are men who would be quite unable to find the money necessary for their ticket, clothes, and fluids on landing.    Such needs ought to be met during the next few years.&quot;4. Our proposals respecting reduction of passagerates will be found in paragraphs 8-1* below.   We are in entire agreement with the Board as to the necessity for simplifying the procedure and dispensing with non essential formalities and restrictions, and we recommend that this question should be at mue taken up with the Dominion Governments .    we, regard this as of primary and urgent  importance.
5. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs hasimpressed upon us the importance of treating proposals fb) and fa) a3 parts of a single scheme, so as to remove any justification for tho criticism that under cover of a reduction of passage rates the British Government are seeking a cheap and easy solution cf t-heir unemployment problem.   Political conditions in Canada arc such that if industrial migration comes   to be identified in tho eyes of Canadian public opinion with relief of:unemployment, the Canadian Government would in his opinion at once increase the ^landing rate1 to such a prohibitive figure as will have the effect of excluding the poorer classes of British migrants.    In view of these considerations the Sub-Committee urge that a scheme for reduction of passage rates should not discriminate oh the ground of destitution but that there should bo a uniform reduced rate of which any reputable British subject should be eligible to take advantage *Reduction, of Third- Class Ocean Bates. 6. Prior to the War the third class  are to CanadaWas about  6, it is now  18 0 15*     It may be noted that of the 53,000 British migrants to Canada in 1927, 29,000 migrated under the Empire Settlement Act procedure, while 24,000 paid their own fares,We believe that this latter figure could be very largely increased If the cost of passage was materially reduced.7*        We agree with the Industrial Transference Board and the Minister of labour that the way In which migration can best contribute substantially towards the problem of tho depressed areas and towards the solution
of tho unemployment problem of the next twelve months is-by facilitating the movement of men who wish to seek their future in non-agricultural occupations overseas, and we draw attention to tho minister&apos;s considered view that it will bo easier to persuade miners to take their ohanoes in Canada by helping them with tho passage rate than by pressing them to accept agriculture as a condition of assistance.    If the President of the Oanadian Pacific Eailway is able to persuade the Canadian Government to accept his view that Canada can absorb a further 25,000 migrants from the United Kingdom next year, the effect will be to enable about 50,000 British industrial migrants to^ be admitted into Canada in the early months of 1929, In addition to those going as assisted agricultural migrants under the Empire Settlement Act.    The experience of 1989 would determine the extent to which similar arrangements&apos; could be made in subsequent years.8.        We are informed by the President of the Board of Trade that it is improbable that the Shipping Companies will agree to reduce the present third-class Canadian rate  ( 18ol5o0) to a figure below  15*   We favour an arrangement during the emergency period of the next throe or five years under which any reputable British citizen should be able to go to Ganada at the cost of  10 for a third-class fare.   We accordingly recommend that the        \ negotiations between the British Government and the Shipping Companies should be directed to securing that the standard thirdt.class passage rate should, during the above emergency pex-iod, be reduced in tho case of British subjects to a figure as near  10 as possible.    It may be noted, that this proposal is in consonance with a specific recommendation contained in a recent Report of the
cj u 0Canadian Parliamentary Committee of Enquiry into ImmigrationB It is Impossible to frame any definite estimate of the cost to the Exchequer of this proposal, but it should not in any case exceed  500^000 a year.9, In the negotiations it will be necessary to take intoaccount the maintenance of the special &quot;agricultural settlers&quot; rate.
10*        A reduction of trie Canadian passage rate from  18.15 to  10 will enable a number of persons to take advantage of the cheap rate without State assistance but thero will remain those persons who can pay little if anything towards the cost of their passage and other necessary expenses.     The Industrial Transference Board recommended that assistance should be given In such cases. On the basis of a standard  10 fare we are informed that the amount required for settlement in Cajoada to-day, Inclusive of ticket, outfit, landing money etc. for a single unassisted man or woman may be put at  25.11. We recommend that in the case of any intendingmigrant who is able to satisfy the competent Authority in Great Britain -(a) that he cannot migrate without financial assistance;(b) that It is reasonable that he should seek work overseas and that he is likely to make a good settlerarrangements should be made for the advance -to him of a free ticket, outfit, landing money, etc, up tosuch amount not exceeding  25 in value (assuming a standardfare of  10) as may be recommended by the competent authority.     Arrangements should be made In Canada underwhich the Shipping and /or Eailway Companies would undertake&amp;o do their best to recover tho advances on the basis ofa small commission.   We do nots however, think it probablethat more than a. limited proportion of the amounts advancedwould ultimately be recovered,,120 It is an essential feature bf our passage rateproposal that an agreement should be reached with the Canadian Government that that Government (1) will not
regard the arrangements as 1charity migration1 or treat the persons taking advantage of the scheme as 1assisted migrants&apos; and will therefore nOt treat the men as prohibited migrants,&quot; and (2) will not raise the present &quot;landing rate1 of 20 dollars a head in the case of British migrants without previous consultation withthe British Government* 13. The negotiations conducted on behalf of the Government -w&amp;lfathe Shipping Companies should be entrusted to the Board of Trade* 14. ThePaaesent Third Glass rate to Australia is  37- 40.    Thenormal assisted passage rate for an adult man or woman is  16.10, The &quot;assisted passages&quot; fall into two main groups - &quot;nominations&quot; and &quot;requisitions&quot; from Australia.    The Report of the Industrial Transference Board draws attention to the fact that in recent years direct .&apos;requisitions&quot; have fallen, as &quot;nominations&quot; have Increased,, and that the increase in &quot;nominations&quot; has thus not produced a proportionate increase in total migration.   We agree with the Board that it is incredible that the  &quot;requisitions&quot; of 6669 in 1927 represented the total number of new farm workers required by Australian farmers, and that a substantial increase in the &quot;requisitions1, is needed.   We also agree with the Board as to the desirability of ensuring that the conditions of entrance to Australia are Intelligible and fixed;, the procedure easy, and the policy stable ever a pex^iod of years.   We suggest that these and other considerations raised in paragraph 120 and elsewhere In the Board&quot;s Report should be vigorously taken up with the Australian authorities.We also think that after a better index*standing has beenreached with the Australian authorities negotiations should beundertaken with the Shipping Companies with a view to securing asubstantial reduction, ^f the ordinary Australian passage rate. TheIndustrial Transference Board have stated that &quot;unless, therefore,the shipping companies will make a serious effort to adjust their rates,they must in some measure share the responsibility for theconsequences of the present restricted movementr.    The attention ofthe Shipping Companies might well be directed to this conclusionfrom so autherative and impartial a source^7.
PROPOSALS OP THE OVERSEA SEri1fi&apos;LEi332fl?

In addition the scheme proposes to Incur as from 1930 onwards recoverable expenditure not exceeding  300,000 a year and a capital expenditure of  3,000,000 for development purposes spread over a period of years.    The scheme in detail is as follows -Housing   TrainingSchemeo       and Passages.

We recommend tlha acceptance of Scheme A as set out in Sections I, II, III and IT of the abore table on the understanding that in the case of Section IT - the annual recruitment training and migration of 2000 -single women - every effort will be made to secure a Dominion contribution towards the estimated cost  ( 59,600 per annum], equivalent in amount to that made by the British Governments
17.   Our approval of Scheme A does not^ extend to the -specific proposal in Part II of CP. 198(28) that a capital sum of, say,  3,000,000 spread over a period of years should be provided for land development and settlement schemes overseas. Our recommendations in this respect are set out below under the heading &quot;observation of liand for British Settlement&quot;. THE IAMD .SETT.TOEHT JKlAN&apos;SCHEME.18.    It is stated in CP* 198(28) that unless there is a background of land settlement behind the migration proposals there will be a grave danger of opposition in the Domimions and unless the miners see a chance of permanently improving their positions, they are not likely to exchange the certainty of the  &apos;doleT and the possibility of a return to high wages, should mining conditions improve, for agricultural wages overseas.    It is accordingly suggested by the Oversea Settlement Committee that s,dult settlers should be promised by the British Government a loan of  1.00 towards establishing themselves upon the land after they have worked not less than two years for wages and have themselves saved a similar sum.      It is proposed that the scheme should be on the same lines and should include the same safeguards as a scheme for Boy settlement arranged between the British and Canadian Governments in 1927, and that the number of grants should be limited to say 3000 In any one year, representing a maximum yearly commitment of  300,000 starting in 1930.--,... We recommend acceptance of this Scheme on condition that it is placed on the pound for pound basis, i.e. that the British government&apos;s loan of  100 should be equated by a contribution of like amount from some Canadian source.    It is not expected that more than 1 in 3 of the settlers eligible for this assistance will avail themselves of the scheme.
3fHei)190     We also favour the proposal of the Oversea Settlement Committee to send not less than 5,000 men to Canada in August next to work as harvesters, but subject thereto we make no recommendations with regard to Scheme B of CP. 198 (28),     The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries has warned us that the proposal in Scheme B to entrust the training of intending migrants to private farmers would raise serious difficulties.RESERVATION OF LAND FOR BRITISH SETTLEMENT.20.     The Oversea Settlement Committee suggested in cp. 198 (28), that, as regards Canada a scheme, orschemes, should be considered in conjunction with theFederal or the individual Provincial Governments for thedevelopment of wholly or partly undeveloped areas on thegeneral lines of the Australian Loan Agreement^, with these important differencest-(1) Money advanced by the British Government for development should be repayable. -(2) British labour should be used for development work In proportion to the amount of capital subscribed.(3) Land should be reserved for British settlers either free or at prairie value, I.e. pre-development land prices.We recommend that the representative of the BritishGovernment should be authorised to enter into negotiationswith the Canadian Authorities with a view to securing the reservation..in the undeveloped districts In question, of areas of land for British settlers.     The negotiations should proceed upon the basis that the British Government are willingto make arrangements with existing organisations, such as
the Provincial Governments,, the Canadian Pacific Railway or the Hudson&apos;s Bay Connmny, for jointly financing development schemes by which British migrants may be employed and settled.THE ADMINISTRATION OF MIGRATION IN GREAT BRITAIN, 21.     Various suggestions have been submitted to us for strengthening the existing offioial administrative machinery In this country concerned with migration,. While we do not feel able to make any specific recommendations as to what changes should be made, we are satisfied as to the need for strengthening the central organisation and for securing the fullest possible measure of effective oo-operation between the various Departments concerned with the subjeot.     We recommend that the Treasury as the competent authority should be requested to undertake an inquiry forthwith into the whole question of the administrates of migration in Great. Britain and should submit recommendations to the Prime Minister with as little delay as possible.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee L, W ORTHINGT ON-EVANS.CHAIRMAN .2f Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.

i 3 Q 3THIS DOG-UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRJTANN1Q-, MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.COPY- NO.SECRETU.P. 9(28) CABINET.UNEMPLOYMENT POLICY COMMITTEE. CONCENTRATION AND ANTICIPATION.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The Committee has still to decide whether the railway-freight relief to coal (up to the amount contemplated in the Plan) should be concentrated upon coal for export and foreign bunkers and coal for iron and steel works; and further whether the railway freight relief on the selected traffics should be anticipated.This double event is what the deputations representing coal and steel are asking.     As regards the force of this demand, the steel trade is united; the depressed areas are united; the coal trade, with the exception of a part of the Federated Area -which is &apos; acquiescent&apos; , presses strongly for concentration.I think that unless concentration is approved, anticipation is not worth while.     The relief which the export districts and the steel works would obtain from a reduction in railway rates spread over all coal would not, in my opinion, produce the results which would justify anticipation.    If I an right in this it follows that the question of concentration must be decided first.On merits I am in favour of further concentration for the following reasons:-(a) The whole of the relief is made effective.    None will be wasted on factors and merchants; &apos; none will pass to the sheltered public utilities; none will go to industries
which are already prosperous, or to industries where the relatively low coal consumption makes the relief a negligible factor in cost.(b) The relief is given where it is most  needed, i.e. to iron and steel and to the coal which has to sell in competitive markets.   The relief also goes to those areas which are peculiarly distressed, and from which the vocal demand comes.I attach a table (Appendix 1.) showing the comparative measure of relief under the Plan as announced, and under the new concentration.    The railways can work this easily, and are strongly in favour of it.Against this on the purely economic side it may be argued that industries which are large users of coal will not get the benefit which they are expecting.    I attach a table (Appendix 2.) which shows the size of the more important industries where coal consumption is high and a rough estimate of their coal consumption.    In.considering the claims of these industries it must be borne in mind that, if the coal trade is properly organised and manages its affairs effectively, those industries could not hope to get , more than half the relief at the outside.    The policy of a wise&apos; cartel would no doubt be to collar the whole relief for coal, unless a using industry was so hard, pressed that it would pay the coal trade to sell cheaper to the industry in order to increase its consumption.I attach little or no importance to the argument that areduction on export freights will give a bounty to competingjforeign industries.    If- this argument were true,  the strong-i &quot;  -es/t opponents would be the steel trade, who are in fact the strongest supporters of the proposal.    Only a limited amount of export coal passes into industrial consumption; and the price of coal is not necessarily governed by the bounty./ - -P -
Balancing these arguments, and considering the question at this stage solely from an economic point of view, I am definitely in favour of the proposed concentration.The only political argument against concentration is the risk of alienating other industries which hope to gat something out of the coal relief,,     As I have indicated, I think this argument is outweighed by the need of the coal and steel industries, by the fact that the great relief to industry is through local rates, and by the declaration of the Government that, while they would fight for the principles of the scheme, details were properly a matter of argument and adjustment.If w,e decide in favour of the new concentration, anticipation at once becomes a live issue,,     On economic merits, I should welcome anticipation in the interest of CJsal and steel.       If the arguments which I have used in favour of the new concentration are sound, then the sooner the relief can be given the better,.      Nor do I think that we need be unduly afraid of foreign retaliation on the score of anticipation.     The relief which we should give would be in effect, the same relief as already announced, though, rather differently distributed,  and   given rather earlier0 If it is possible, I should like to pay the anticipated relief through the same machinery as will be in force after October, 1929, i.e, that the Exchequer should pay its contribution to the Local Authorities.     But, even if the Railway Companies pay their own rates in full up till October, 1929,  and we pay three-quarters of those rates to the Railway Companies, I think we can still defend our position.     We should not be in a much more vulnerable position as regards the charge of subsidy than we ere now under the plan as announced0
The Ministry of Transport would have to arrange with the Railway Companies that, if an application Is made to the Railway Rates Tribunal next spring, the Companies should not claim that the selected traffics could, by reason of anticipation, bear an Increased rate.     The whole question of preventing the Railway   Rates Tribunal operating exclu-sively upon selected traffics will have to be dealt with in any case; and I do not think that anticipation adds to our difficulties there.If the Committee accept my views on the economic advantages of concentration and anticipation, there remains the political question:    &quot;Should we refuse anticipation on the ground that it may fail to produce a substantial improvement in coal and steel, and thereby prejudice the present popularity of our scheme with expectant industry?&quot;. As regards the results of anticipation, I cannot usefully add anything to what I have already said to the Committee.     I think Kr Evan Williams&apos;s estimates are inflated and are negatived by past experience.-  ,  I think, on the other hand, that the steel makers, In their anxiety for a duty, are Inclined to under-rate womewhat any other benefits they may receive.     While I cannot guarantee that we shall do a large amount more trade if we anticipate I think that the following (more negative) advantages would result from anticipation:-(a) The financial position of some collieries will be materially improved,     Some of those collieries are among the hardest hit financially, and most of them are in the most depressed areas.     As we know, there is a tendency in the coal trade for any colliery to hang on as long es it can.     Probably, therefore, anticipation will delay the closing down of some pits which would otherwise go out.     Superficially, and over a short but critical period, this will be helpful.
0(5 7(b) The coal industry is to-day more inclined to try to make district agreements and a national agreement as between districts.   The kilning Association urge that concentration and anticipation will help them to do this.(c) V&apos;e should be giving to the depressed areas what coal owners, minors, Members of Parliament and local bodies In those areas are asking for.(d) If we do nothing, and the position gets worse, these claimants will say that all would have been well If we had done what they asked.(e) Industry generally is looking for.its big relief to the remission of local rates and not to railway rates. I should hope, therefore, that industry generally would not be unduly oast down if the railway relief is not a great success.   - 1On th? whole, therefore, my opinion on the political issue, for what it is worth, Is that the balance of advantage is in favour of anticipation.P.

Memorandum by the Minister of..Trg^ gort..In Memorandum U.P.(28) 9 the President of the Board of Trade refers to the possibility of an Increase In railway freights next spring when the Railway Rates Tribunal Is required by statute to review the scheme of railway charges. It Is not possible to predict the probable action of the Railway Companies or the Tribunal.      But It Is the duty of the Tribunal to make such modifications In charges as they may think necessary to enable the Companies to earn the standard revenue fixed under the Railways Act,  and, as tho Railways will be far short of thoir standard revenue, they may feel bound to apply for Increased charges affecting the heavy traffics0I agree with the President that steps would have to be taken to prevent any claim that the selected traffics could, just because they are bein;; relieved under some special scheme, bear exclusively an increased freight charge.      It is, however, I think,- also necessary to consider the position which would arise if these traffics with others were subjected to some general or widely distributed increase in freights in the next year or two by decision of the Tribunal.     When derating is in force, we  could say that, while it was disappointing that the actual stimulus of a reduction In the freight burden should be diminished, or neutralised, by Increases due to general ./ -1.- &apos;
circumstances, yet the selected traffics were better off, by virtue of our scheme, than they would otherwise have been. The benefit.of derating the railways would still flow to them and nothing more oould be demanded.Will not the position be more difficult If once we have given an open subsidy to freights?    Pressure would be brought by the selected trades for an Increase or a revival of the subsidy to protect them from bearing their share of the genera]. Increasec      It could, of course, be said that anticipation,, related to the probable effect of derating, is not essentially different from the&apos; permanent scheme, but the fact that a subsic&quot; had been provided&apos; under a special vote would remain and all the interests affected might found claims for special assistanceupon that fact. I feel It my duty to bring this point before my colleagues and the Cabinets20      If anticipation Is applied to public railways,, there will be demands, for assistance by the owners of private mineral railways.      Canals will also claim to be admitted and in fair-ness could not be excluded,.     With very few exceptions, the Canals are not themselves the carriers of traffic and special machinery would have to be created to enable them to work a scheme of subsidy,,3,      If anticipation were decided upon, I do not think it would be practicable to bring any properly considered scheme into operation before the first of January next,.     Complicated details (which it has not been possible to discuss with the transport companies concerned) would have to be settled and agreements drawn up to cover them(Intld.)

There are, of course, some black spots&apos;, such as the Bishop.Auckland area, but speaking generally the incidence of malnutrition is probably not more serious than has long been the case in big towns like London.    The black spots are usually spots where living conditions and physique hare been low,- reference in prosperous times.    For Instance, the relatively bad conditions in the Bishop Auckland area are, I fancy, due less to the present depression than to the poor earnings for many years past among miners working on the thin coalfields of the western part of the Durham coalfield;&apos; those in Blaina and Nantyglo are certainly due to the facti.
that this area has &quot;&quot;been practically derelict ever since the end of the war;    those in Whitehaven are explained by long standing evils of bad housing and over^rowdjLng.     On the other hand, the Monmouthshire survey shows that there is actually a lower percentage of malnutrition in some hard hit mining towns like Shymney and Tredegar then in some of the rural schools.     The real truth about the mining areas, as a whole, seems to be that whereas in the past they have been, for the most parts exceptionally healthy, they are now falling into the category of what are known as &quot;c jntinuous feeding areas&quot;, i.e* towns like London where malnutrition is, so to speak, endemic and where meals are always, being provided, for a certain number if children.I have consequently been advising Local Authorities In these areas to adopt certification by the School Medical Officer as the basis of school feeding, instead of the &quot;necessitousness&quot; of the family.    So long as &quot;necessitousness is taken as the criterion, the Guardians are obviously bound to take such feeding into account and to make a deduction from the relief in respect of it.   Medical certification gets over this.difficulty and, moreover, safeguards the Local Authority from being forced into indiscriminate feeding by the pressure of local opinion.   While &quot;continuous feeding areas&quot; usually adopt some kind of concentrated meals such as milk aiad cod liver oi2.a the character of the meal is not the ,point and there is no reason why a &quot;square meal&quot; should not be given where it Is medically desirable.   Milk meals are, in fact, now being given on modical certificate in Glamorgan County, Ehondda, Merthyr Tydfil, and other areas.While conditions are reasonably good at present, medical opinion seems to be that they might deteriorate
rapidly at any moment.      In South Wales, Northuubarl^nd and Durham we have enough information to enable us to detect deterioration quickly gnd we are collecting similar information in other areas.    If it becomes necessary to extend school feeding, however special Exchequer assistance will almost certainly be necessary and we should be ready to provide it, though it would be unwise to annoiuice this in advancesBoard of Education, S.W.&apos;io 19th July, 1928.3 c
(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)^ SECRET.r-;-- COPY NO;U.P. (28). 10,CABINET. UNEMPLOYMENT POLICY COMMITTEE.(Circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for War).GRANTS FOR WORK IN RELIEF OF ----&quot;^gTOgF] *&quot;*1.     The Committee have hitherto not discussed the question of relief works financed through the Unemployment Grants Committee.2.     At present the Unemployment Grants Committee may make grants to areas where unemployment is &quot;exceptional&quot;, and for works which are definitely antioipatory of normal development by five years.     This was laid down in a circular issued In December, 1925, and superseding the previous conditions which allowed the Unemployment Grants Committee to finance relief works on the general condition that the schemes would not have been ^proceeded with apart from the need of relieving the unemployment in the area. The amount of the Unemployment Grants Committee *s assistance which usually takes the form of a grant towards the interest and sinking fund-charges on the loan raised for the works is, if capitalised, about 43 per cent, of the capital value of the works.3,     The present conditions are quite effective in restricting the activities of the Committee.     Even where areas can showexceptional unemployment, I,e. unemployment substantially in excess of the average for the whole country, they have about reached the limit of the works which they can plausiblyclaim to be anticipated.     Further, the Ministry of Healthhave not unreasonably curbed the desire of Local Authoritiesalready hard hit financially to commit themselves for further-1-
capital liabilities.4o     The Industrial Transference Board, paragraph 42, declares, and rightly declares, that grants of assistance by the Unemployment Grants Committee financing relief works carried out by local Authorities in depressed areas for the temporary employment of men In those areas are a negation of the policy which ought to be pursued.5.     At the same time, .and even uuder the most favourable conditions,  the policy of transfer takes time to operate arid, the effects of the rating relief cannot he felt before tho end of next year.    It is doubtful, therefore, whether we ought to exclude entire 13^ a policy of State-aided works on which men from depressed areas can be employed during the winter.     One criticism that will certainly be made when the Governmentrs policy is announced next week is that it will not have immediate effect during the winter. 6.     It would be most unfortunate if the policy of transfer were weakened by a general policy of relief works, and it is therefore essential that a scheme of relief works should be related to the transfer policy and sh ould lead so far as practicable directly to the transfer of men from the depressed areas.     In other words relief works to relieve depressed areas ought to be carried out in prosperous areas and the labour employed upon them must be drawn from the depressed areas.     If the Government is to have the right to lay this down as a condition it will be necessary for them to .pay appreciably more then 43 per cent, of the cost of the schemes, as otherwise prosperoiis areas whicSh see no need to anticipate works will not anticipate, and if they do anticipate they will not agree to employ unemployed from other areas while they have any appreciable number of unemployed in their own area.
7,      lf* therefore, the policy of relief works Is to be adopted, arrangements will have to be made either for the Government to approach prosperous areas direct or for depressed areas to approach prosperous areas with the knowledge that the Government will pay by instalments over a number of years half the capital value of the works, on condition that the Local Authority in vdiose area the works are carried out recruits half the labour employed on the job through the Employment Exchange from men from depressed areas which shall be decided by the Ministry of Labour08.     I am fully aware of the difficulties both practical and financial in any proposal of this kind, but the question of relief works seems to me to be so important that I feel It ought not to be passed over without serious examination.       If it is decided that a policy of relief works is to be instituted next winter, it is necessary to take an immediate decision in principle so that the preliminary steps may be taken with Local Authorities for submission of schemes which can begin in the winteroW hit ehal 1 Gar de ns, S -V;, 1, July 20th, 1928,,A note will be circulated at the meeting of the Committee showing the annual value of schemes approved by the Grants Committee, and the annual liability of the Exchequer in respect of those schemes a
