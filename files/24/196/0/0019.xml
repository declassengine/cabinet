[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government. ] Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1928.SECRET. .u Copy No,     28moil .&amp;exploiting.CP. 219 (28).CABINET.THE RACE-COURSE BETTING BILL.THE attached letter, dated the 6th July, 1928, from Lord Hamilton of Dalzell, is circulated by direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for consideration at the meeting of the Cabinet to be held on Wednesday next, the 11th July, 1928.(Signed) M. P. A. HANKEY,Secretary to the Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, July 9, 1928.To the Rt. Hon. W. S. Churchill, C.H., M.P. park street W 1My dear Chancellor, July Q, 1928.. THE Private Members&apos; time available for the Race Course Betting Bill is now exhausted, and, as Chairman of the Joint Committee of the Jockey Club and National Hunt Committee, I must ask for the fulfilment of the promise of &quot;facilities&quot; given by you on behalf of the Government last autumn, both by a statement in the House of Commons and in a letter to myself.That the obligation of the Government in regard to this is now much greater than it was when the undertaking was given is made clear by a glance at the Bill in its present form, and by an analysis of the time taken up by the several points considered on Report stage to-day in the House of Commons.Of the operative portions of the Bill, 3 lines deal with our original proposals, and 132 with the additions made since second reading. These 132 lines were intro-duced either by the promoters of the Bill at the behest of the Government or directly by the Government representative on the Committee.Of the five hours given to the Bill to-day in the House of Commons, one and a half hours were occupied by a request to the Speaker that the Bill should be with-drawn on the ground that it had been altered in Committee to such an extent that it was no longer the measure to which the House had agreed on second reading, and by a motion to re-commit it to a select committee for the same reason; two and a half hours were occupied by the consideration of the amendment to substitute the Jockey Club and National Hunt Committee for the Racecourse Betting Control Board, which, if agreed to, would have put the Bill back in the form in which we originally drew it up ; the remaining hour was occupied by the consideration of an amendment which would have made the Bill applicable to all forms of racing, whether by horses, dogs, men, or otherwise.It will be seen from this that no amendment considered in order by the Speaker to-day dealt with the provisions of the measure originally introduced.I therefore think it fair to say that without the Government amendments the Bill would to-day have gone through Report and Third Reading without any difficulty.In saying this I am not taking into consideration the immense amount of time spent by the Committee in consideration of the Government amendments.In view of the above, I think you will agree that the grave position to-day shows[17923]
that the case I made out for full Government support in my letter of the 26th June, 1928, was more than justified.In justice, therefore, both to the bodies I represent and to the supporters of the Bill in Committee who, on the faith of the Governments promise, have generously given their time over a long period, I appeal to you, as the Minister who gave the undertaking, to see that the Bill is not wrecked.Yours sincerely, (Signed) HAMILTON of DALZELL.
