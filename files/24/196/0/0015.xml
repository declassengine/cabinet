[This Document is the Property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet,      July 1928.SECRET.CP. 215 (28),The &quot;No-tax&quot; Movement in the Bardoli taluka, Bombay.I circulate for the information of my colleagues in the Cabinet a copy of a telegram which I have to-day despatched to the Viceroy on the subject of the movement which is being conducted in the Bardoli taluka, Bombay Presidency, for the non-payment of taxes, as a protest against the re-assessment of revenue in that area. The movement, as my colleagues will be aware from recent Press reports, has developed to a serious pitch.BIRKENHEAD.4th July 1928.    -Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated A-th July 1928.Private and personal. I am seriously perturbed by newspaper reports of what is going on in Bardoli. Apart altogether from its bearing on situation as regards Simon Commission it is surely impossible to tolerate the sort of unofficial government which seems to have been set up and to which subsidy from President of Legislative Assembly must seem to people to give official sanction. Leslie Wilson has written to me about it more than once, and it seems to me imperative before things go any further to demonstrate unmistakably that Government can and will govern. The responsibility is yours, but I shall, of course, give you fullest support in any measures you and Wilson think it necessary to take, such as arrest of leaders under Bombay Regulation XXV of 1827, if there are no other means of dealing with them, or intensive campaign of distraint for non-payment under protection of troops. This may not improve prospects of co-operation with Simon, but re-assertion of Government authority seems to me even more important at the moment.29l0      75   7.28
