[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.Secret. tfdpy no.   28CP. 235 (38).CABINET.fN 3639/14l!/38]PROTECTION FOR BRITISH TRAWLERS ON THE MURMAN COAST.THE President of the; Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and I think&apos; it right to ask the Cabinet for a decision on the question what, if any, protection should be afforded tb trawlers on the Murmah coast. :- (TJie&apos; various alternative^&apos; and the&apos; arguments- for Or1 against each are set out in the attached memorandum.A. G.Foreign Office, July 13, 1928;Memorandum.Previous to the year 1923,-British trawlers fished on the Murman coast outside the 3&quot;-mile limit under the protection of a naval patrol, as the Soviet Government claimed the right to control fishing on that coast up to a 12-mile limit. In that year the patrol was withdrawn on the understanding that the trawlers would not be molested ; but that undertaking naturally lapsed on the breach of relations with the. Soviet, and it was decided that, in order to avoid the risk of incidents, the trawlers should, if possible, be dissuaded from continuing the fishery. They agreed to discontinue it in the previous season, but they now desire to renew it, stating that the Germans are making large profits there ; and they are supported by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, who fear that failure to assert British rights for the second year in succession will so prejudice them that they cannot be reasserted, especially since the Germans have accepted a Soviet concession (given to a private trawling association) to fish between the 3- and 12-mile limit. It is admitted, however, that alternative fishing grounds can be found off Iceland, and that last season the Icelandic catch more than compensated for the loss of the Murman catch. Also it is not clear why the mere fact of absence should prejudice our rights.As the trawler owners are likely to instigate a considerable agitation if their requests are not granted,- interdepartmental meetings have been held to consider possible courses of action, and the following alternatives have been suggested : 1. To modify the previous warning by stating that we do not wish to prevent the trawlers from going, but that if they do go it must be entirely at their own risk, and that effective protection cannot be guaranteed in case of trouble.2. To send an armed trawler to accompany the fishing boats, not to protect them, but ostensibly to keep order among them, with private instructions to observe and report on any disputes that might occur between them and the Soviet authorities.3. To send an armed escort capable of protecting the boats and with orders to protect them outside the 3-mile limit if necessary, as done before 1923.4. To ask the Soviet Government, through the Norwegian Minister in Moscow, whether they will abstain from interference with the trawlers.4521   [17951]
The advantages of 1 are: (a) that it does not involve His Majesty&apos;s Government in any responsibility ; and (6) that, if the trawler owners would be satisfied with it, it would probably enable them to fish without danger, since all our information goes to show that the Soviet authorities are not anxious to give any pretext for British intervention, and would probably not interfere with the trawlers. Its disadvantages are : (a) that it will probably not satisfy the trawler owners ; and (b) that there must in any case be some risk of action by the Soviet authorities, and that, if such action were taken, His Majesty&apos;s Government wotild be powerless to help the crews of the trawlers except by some act of reprisals which might lead to serious consequences.The advantages of 2 are : (a) that it could be arranged without difficulty by the Admiralty ; and (b), in the opinion of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, would both satisfy the trawler owners and probably prevent any Russian interference. Its disadvantages are: (a) that the despatch of any naval vessel is likely to be regarded as provocative, by the Soviet Government ; and (b) that if a case of interference were to,occur, it would at once become evident that His Majesty&apos;s Government were merely bluffing, so that their prestige would suffer a serious blow, and the last state of the question would be worse than the first...........................The advantages of 3 are : (a) that it would obviate any risk of Soviet interference and completely satisfy the trawler owners and the Minister of Fisheries, and (6) would also improve British prestige and prevent the opponents of the policy of breaking off relations with the Soviet from arguing that British fishing interests were better served by a policy of continuing relations at any price.. Its disadvantages, are : (a) that it would, even more than 2, be regarded as provocative by the Soviet; and (6) that the Admiralty would be reluctant to incur the expense of providing a sufficient force.The sole advantage of 4 is that it might conceivably result in an assurance from the Soviet Government which would enable the trawlers to fish without any further action on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and without any of the risks involved in the adoption of 1. Its disadvantages are : (a) that it is not desirable to ask a favour of the Soviet Government ; and (fe) that it would give that Government the opportunity to raise the whole question of the right of fishing within the 12-mile limit. .* &apos;It must, of course, be remembered that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot prevent the trawlers from going, if they choose to disregard our warnings and take the risk, and can get an insurance company to do the same.Northern Department, Foreign Office, July 12, 1928.
