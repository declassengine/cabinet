I hope to circulate early next week for the approvalof the Cabinet a draft of the Memorandum on Local Government changes in Scotland oonee&amp;uent upon the Scheme of Bating relief.2. She main purposes of these changes are to enlargetft* units of Local Authority administration, and to reduce the number of different types of Local Authorities administering local services in each area.    Scotland is pre-eminently a country of small administrative units.    There are 869 Parish Councils, 201 Town Councils, 08 District Committees. 37 Education Authorities, 33 County Councils, and 27 District Boards of Control.   All these are independent local authorities for the purposes of the particular services they administer. Many of them operate for areas of very small population and rateable value, and the multiplicity of authorities, in typo and number, tends to overlapping and waste.   Apart from the de-rating proposals of the Government, there was a strong case for reform of Local Government on the lines now proposed, but the vested interests of existing authorities imposed a formidable bar.   The present moment seems opportune for a change.   The de-rating under, the Government scheme intensifies the urgency of the problem1 from the point of view of the financially weak authorities, while the new system of Exchequer Grants should go a long way towards minimising opposition.3. It is proposed to abolish Parish Councils, district committees. Education Authorities, and District Boards of Control,   The functions of these bodies will devolve upon reconstituted County Councils, and upon Town Councils of Burghs with a population of 20,000 or over.    It is also proposed to transfer to County Counoils the powers and duties of the Town Councils of Burghs under 20,000 population relating to the major Public Health Services, Police and Classified Roads.4. Under these proposals, the authorities for Poor Law,the major Public Health Services, and Classified Roads will be the County Council (acting for the County inclusive 6f the smaller Burghs), and the Town Council of the larger Burghs.The Eduoation Authority will bo the Town Councils of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, and elsewhere the County Council (acting for the County inclusive of all Burghs except those above mentioned).   The Lunacy Authority will bea/
5a Joint Committ-ee of&quot; the County Councils and Town Councils of the larger Burghs In the area comprised in the lunaay District,As some of the Counties, are very small, it is proposed to take power to combine Counties for all administrative purposes.    It is also proposed to take power to combine contiguous Burghs,3* Strenuous opposition to these proposals is to beexpected from the Authorities to be abolished! and from the Councils of the smaller Burghs, whose powers aa regards Public Health. Police and Roads will be diminished.   There may also be some reluctance on the part of Authorities on whom new duties are to be Imposed to undertake the additional responsibilities.There has however been a movement in Scotland in reoent years towards a reform of local Government, which is likely to be much strengthened by the attractive results of the financial side of the Government&apos;0 soheme, and this will tend to neutralise the opposition of the vested interests.6. As regards the proposal to abolish EducationAuthorities and to transfer their powers and duties to the County Councils and the Town Councils of the four large cities, it is right to remind the Cabinet that while this was the original proposal of the Government in 1918, the pressure of opinion In favour of an ad. hoc Authority was so strong that the Government had to give way and modify the Bill of 1918 accordingly.Experience has, however., shown that&apos; the public interest in the ad frop authority^as measured by the percentage of electors voting at polls since the Act of 1918 &quot;became operatlv&amp;/ie small, and there is a growing feeling that the gd, hop&quot; authorities have been somewhat extravagant in their administration.7. The formula for Scotland is exactly similar to thatof England&apos; in its application to the larger burghs and administrative counties.It has however been found necessary to introduce a elicit modification of the scheme for distributing the Grant available to an administrative County among the authorities within the County in order to meet the circumstances of the future County government of Scotland,    The smaller burghs within the County will receive Grant on the same basis as in England, but the landward area will receive a somewhat larger share of the County money than is be-teig allowed to rural diet riot councils in England - the reason being that the new authority for the landward area will perform wider and more important functions than those of a rural district council.It/
6It 1b estimated that the new money required to meet the Grants payable under the formula in Scotland will amount to  750,000.8. The tables appended to the Memorandum show theeffect of the scheme on the rates payable in each large burgh and in eight selected counties.   All these burins will gain under the formula and in the oase of the more industrial burghs tllQ gain will be substantial.    The results in the selected counties are also satisfactory from the ratepayers&apos; point of view, more especially in the necessitous areas.In the case of certain areas there will, of oourse, be an increase in the rate poundage, but this will be met by the proposed guarantee.&apos; JOHN GILMOURiScottish Office. 23rd June, 1920.

Proposals for Reform in Local Government in Scotland, and for Readjustment of the Financial Relations    between    the    Exchequer    and    LocalAuthorities.1. Witli a view to the assistance of agriculture and productive indus-trial undertakings, the Government have framed proposals for an altera-tion of the basis of rating of agricultural and industrial subjects designed to lighten the burden of local rates which at present presses upon these interests. The nature of these proposals was outlined in the Budget statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and, as was then indicated, they involve important alterations in the system of Exchequer Grants, and modifications of the existing system of Local Government in Scotland. The Finance Bill, and the Rating and Valuation (Apportionment) Bill, contain parts of the legislative programme necessary to give effect to the scheme, and it is the intention that the remainder of the programme should be embodied in Bills to be laid before Parliament in the Autumn. The purpose of this Memorandum is to explain in some detail, for the informa-tion of Local Authorities, the nature and scope of the legislative proposals in the confident anticipation that the Government in framing the legis-lation may have the advantage of the co-operation of the Local Authori-ties.2. Under the Scheme, it is proposed that Agricultural subjects shall be rated on one-sixth of the gross annual value, and that Industrial subjects and Freight-transport subjects shall be rated on one-fourth of the rateable value, as ascertained under the provisions of the Bating (Scotland) Act, 1926.The definitions of Agricultural, Industrial and Freight-transport subjects are contained in the Rating and Valuation (Apportionment) Bill, which also makes provision for effecting the necessary entries in the Valuation Roll. The de-rating proposals will come into operation in England as from 1st October, 1929, and provision will be made for a pro-portionate de-rating in Scotland in the financial year 1929-30.3. These de-rating proposals necessarily involve a large loss of rates to Local Authorities.; It is impossible to state with precision the amount of the loss until the preparation of the valuation roll to be made under the Rating and Valuation (Apportionment) Bill has been completed. The total for Scotland may, however, be estimated in round figures at  3,200,000 for the year 1927-28. To meet this loss an alternative source of revenue must be provided and the Chancellor of the Exchequer has stated that he is prepared, as part of the general scheme, to find moneys for this purpose from the Exchequer.4. The receipts of Local Axithorities from Government grants in the year 1926-27 (which is the latest year for which complete figures are available) were approximately  13,000,000, while the total of rates levied was  20,500,000.   If in that year the relief now proposed had already
been, given to industrial and agricultural property, and the proportion of local expenditure to be found under the present scheme from the; Exchequer had corresponded with the above estimate of  3,200,000, the; relation between grants and rates would have been: Grants      ..       ..       ..-      ..       ..    16,200,000Rates        ......       ....    17,300,000It has seemed to the Government that so large an increase in the. Exchequer grants in aid of rates necessitates some reconsideration of the grant system, and the more so because reforms in regard to certain parts of that system have long been accepted as necessary. In par-ticular (and especially having in mind that the relief of industry is a primary reason for undertaking a scheme of this magnitude) it Las seemed to the Government that no scheme of the kind would be complete unless consideration were given to the case of those districts which have been commonly called necessitous areas.5. If the de-rating proposals are important as affecting Local Authori-ties as a whole, they are no less so in their influence on individual Local Authorities. It.must first be remarked that no scheme for providing an alternative source of revenue for Local Authorities can take the form of a grant varying from year to year with the expenditure of individual Authorities. Under such a scheme the Government would be committed to finding a material proportion of every Local Authority&apos;s general expenditure without an)&apos; possibility of effective control, and the financial interest of Local Authorities in their administration would be seriously impaired.6. The most important effect of the de-rating proposals on the posi-tion of the individual Local Authority is the narrowing of the basis of taxation available to that Authority, which necessarily involves a greater or less impairment of the capacity to meet the considerable fluctuations in expenditure inevitable from time to time. This is a matter of less significance in the case of larger Authorities, or of those, whose resources are drawn from a wide area, but is of the greatest import-ance in the case of smaller and financially weaker Authorities who may be responsible for services involving considerable expenditure liable to periodic fluctuations between wide limits.An examination of returns rendered by Local Authorities indicates that the loss of rates in rural parishes due to the de-rating proposals will vary from about 3 per cent, to 60 per cent. Thus, in the extreme case, the reduced assessable value on which would be charged any future increase in the cost of the local services would be not more, than 40 per cent, of the present assessable value; in other words, where the Local Authority at present would require to meet an increase of expenditure by an additional levy of Is. in the  , it would, in the future, in the absence of special action, have to levy a rate of 2s. 6d. in the  . In many parishes a rate of Id. per   of reduced valuation will yield less than  10.7. For the reasons stated in the preceding paragraphs the Government have come to the conclusion that the necessary accompaniments of the
derating scheme are (a) some modification of the basis and method of Government contribution to local services : (6) arrangements to meet the case of the necessitous areas ; and (c) arrangements to obviate the difficulties of those Authorities whose finances are on too narrow a basis. If the case of necessitous areas is to be met, a new method of distribution of Government grants and reorganisation of administrative arrangements are both requisite. Change in the areas or functions of certain autho-rities is the only way in which a remedy can properly be found for the difficulties of those authorities whose resources would be inadequate to enable them to meet their needs under the new conditions. Moreover, a fundamental part of the scheme is the introduction of a system of block grants based upon general characteristics and needs, and these must be ascertained for administrative areas sufficient in size to present average conditions.8. The alterations required to meet the objects which the Government have in mind can only proceed on the basis of widening the area of charge. The services for which there is a clear case for modification of this kind are. the poor law, public health and highway administration ; and in these cases it appears to the Government that the duties should be entrusted to Local Authorities of the first importance, and that the area of the charge should be as wide as is compatible with effective local interest, in the work to be undertaken ; such a change is fully consistent with the principles on which local government is organised.PROPOSED LOCAL GOVERNMENT REFORMS. 9. In Scotland there, are a large number of Local Authorities which administer public services for very small areas, and the need for a reduction in the number of these authorities, and an. enlargement of the units of administration has been generally realised, in recent years, and. has been given effect to in connection with certain services, e.g., the treatment, of tuberculosis. Tt is an essential element of the Govern-ment scheme that the. opportunity should be taken of effecting a wide-reaching reform in this sphere, which will make for an increase in simplicity and efficiency of administration. One important object to be kept in view is the unification of administrative and financial control of the major services under a single authority in each area. By this means it is hoped : (1) to prevent overlapping of services such as now exists ;(2) to make better and fuller use of the numerous institutions belonging to local authorities;(3) to secure more effective control over local expenditure by the authority of the area, not only with a view to economy, but also with a view to seeing that that expenditure is being applied to the best advantage according to the needs, financial ability and other circumstances of the area ; and(4) generally to promote efficiency in administration of the various services, thereby adding to the well-being of the persons for whom the services are administered.(12/34-2)q a 2fi
Accordingly, it is proposed to abolish Parish Councils, Education Authorities, District Committees and District Boards of Control; and to transfer from the smaller - authorities to authorities operating for enlarged areas the administration of the major health services. These proposals are dealt with in greater detail in the paragraphs which follow. &apos;10. It is proposed to transfer to County Councils as they will be constituted under the scheme  ,.(a) The powers and duties of Parish Councils in landward areas andin burghs with a population of less than 20,000 ; .(6) the powers and duties of District Committees relating to PublicHealth, Roads and Highways, etc. ; -..\(c) certain of the powers and duties relating to Public Health, of Town Councils of burghs with a population of less than 20,000, which will include- * ,(1) Housing and town planning; i.(2) Hospital and other institutional services ; 11(3) Infectious diseases (including tuberculosis and venerealdiseases) ; (4) Maternity and child welfare ;(5) Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and Milk and DairiesActs ; (6) Water supply ; (7) Drainage ;(8) Prevention of rivers pollution ;(rf) the powers and duties relating to the management and main-tenance of classified roads of burghs with a population of less than 20,000 ;(e) the powers and duties of burghs with a population of less than20,000 relating to the valuation of lands and heritages ; (/) the powers and duties of Education Authorities, except in theburghs of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee ; (g) the control and management of the police in burghs with a popu-lation of less than 50,000 ; (A) the powers and duties of the Standing Joint Committee in rela-tion to the police.II. The powers and duties of District Boards of Control, except in the case where the district board is now the parish council,* will be trans-ferred to county councils and town councils of burghs with a population of 20,000 and over. The asylums for the several lunacy districts will be managed in each case by a Joint Committee of the constituent autho-rities within the district.12. To meet the case of the smaller counties, it is proposed, to take, power to combine counties for all administrative purposes, and also to take power to combine contiguous burghs.   The Standing Joint Com-* As regards these see page 26.
mittee will cease to exist. Special provisions will be necessary for the regulation of the performance of the extensive new duties of the county council, and wide powers will be given of delegation of functions to committees of the council and to town councils of burghs within the county. Provision will be made for the due representation on the council of burghs with a population of less than 20,000, and for a re-determination of the numbers of county councillors and the number and boundaries -of electoral divisions. The burghal representatives on the county council will be nominated by town councils from their own numbers, and the system of triennial election of county councils will continue. Provision will also be made for the representation on the county council, as educa-tion authority, of burghs (except the four largest burghs) with a population of 20,000 and over.13. It is proposed to transfer to the Town Council of Glasgow the powers and duties of the District Boards of Control of Glasgow and Govan, and to the Town Councils of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee and Paisley the powers and duties of the District Boards of Control of these areas respectively ; to transfer to the Town Councils of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, the powers and duties of the Education Authorities of these burghs respectively; and to transfer to the Town Councils of all burghs with a population of 20,000 or over the powers and duties of the Parish Councils in theii^ffireas. The opportunity will also be taken to carry out certain outstanding reforms of the Scottish poor law.14. It is proposed that these alterations in the system of local govern-ment should take effect as from 16th May, 1930... 15. As regards the proposed transfer to county councils of the powers and duties of the town councils of the smaller burghs, relating to the management and maintenance of classified roads, it is contemplated that the. town councils will retain the management of, and responsibility for, non-classified roads and streets, and that county councils may enter into arrangements with town councils to carry out the actual work on classified roads in burghs where such a course appears to be justified by considerations of efficiency and econony. Where such arrangements are made, the cost would be a charge on the county rate. The percentage grants in respect of classified roads for which county councils are respon-sible, including for this purpose the classified roads in the smaller burghs, will continue to be paid on a percentage basis as heretofore and will not be merged in the scheme of block grants outlined later in this Memorandum.16. As regards classified roads in burghs with a population of 20,000 and over, the grants paid in respect of maintenance and ordinary improve-ment will be merged in the scheme of block grants. Works in the nature of major improvements of classified roads in such burghs will, however, continue to receive assistance through special grants from the Road Fund on a percentage basis as heretofore.(12/342)q a 3
-   J:,: .     .        .8     : :^/.:r. -17... Provision will-be made for the transfer of officers,and servants of the superseded local authorities and for the compensation of such officers and servants of these and other authorities as suffer pecuniary loss by reason of the proposed legislation. A local authority which will cease to exist may have adopted the Local Government and other Officers&apos; Superannuation Act. 1922. If their officers and servants are transferred to a local authority which.has likewise adopted the Act provision will be made for the amalgamation of the superannuation funds and the admin-istration of the Joint Fund. If the transfer is to a local authority which has not adopted the Act, the superannuation fund will be transferred to them and they will be required to continue to administer the Act for behoof of the officers within the scheme in the same mauner as if they had been the adopting Authority.18. Financial adjustments will be necessary in a number of cases, e.g., where a parish is partly landward and partly burghal and the functions of the parish council in the landward area are transferred to a county council and in the burghal area to a town council. In such cases a division of assets and liabilities between the authorities in whom new powers are vested will be required, and should present no difficulty.RATING.19. The present rating authorities (County Councils and Town Councils) will remain unaffected by the scheme and, consequently, burghs which are required to contribute towards services administered by the County Council will do so on precept, the amount of the contribution being based on the new rateable valuation.20. As regards burghs with a population of 20,000 and upwards (hereinafter referred to as &quot; large burghs &quot;) the poor rate and other rates in respect of services transferred from the Parish Council will be levied uniformly over the whole area of the burgh.21. As regards counties the projected re-arrangement of local govern-ment services will necessarily involve a number of changes in the area over which certain rates will be charged. The following are the changes which, it is proposed to make : (i) Roads. Expenditure on classified roads will be a charge-uponthe whole area of the county, including burghs with a population of less than 20.000 (hereinafter referred to as &quot; small burghs &quot;) ; expenditure on unclassified roads will be a charge upon the whole landward area of the county and not by reference to the existing- county districts which will disappear.(ii) Poor and&apos; Recjislraiiou.-Expenditure will be a&apos;charge uponthe whole area of the county, including the small burghs, (hi) Police. Expenditure will be a charge upon the whole areaof the county, except in cases of special police districts, (iv) Public Health. Expenditure in respect of the major services to be administered by the County Council for the whole
12area of the county, including the small burghs, will be a fi &quot; charge  upon that  area.   Expenditure   on  minor  health services corresponding to those administered by the Town Councils of small burghs will be a charge upon the whole landward area. As regards water supply and drainage, &apos; where special districts have been, or are, constituted, the - expenditure, will, as at present, be a charge on the special district, and it is proposed to assimilate the position of small burghs to that of special districts ; in other cases, the expenditure, on these services will be a charge on the whole, area, excluding special districts and small burghs treated as special districts. Expenditure on housing will, as at present, be a charge upon the landward area or upon the small burgh, according as the houses are for the benefit of the inhabitants of such landward area or burgh. Expenditure on lighting and scavenging will remain a charge upon the special district benefiting therefrom. (Lighting and scavenging in small burghs will remain with the Town Council and the expenditure thereon will be a charge on the burgh ratepayers.)As regards water suppty, drainage, housing, lighting and scavenging, it is proposed that, with a view to providing for the development of these services, the County Council shall be empowered to contribute to them out of the general county rate in cases where, the expenditure imposes an unduly heavy burden on the ratepayers of the special district or burgh. &apos;   V &apos; -(v) Burial Grounds. Expenditure will be a charge upon the wholelandward area of the county and upon those burghs which are not authorities under the Burial- Grounds Act.(vi) Special Parish Rate purposes (Local Government (Scotland) Act,1894) and Public Libraries. Expenditure will be a charge upon the particular parish or landward part of parish concerned.FINANCIAL PROPOSALS.,22. The grants from Imperial sources to local services which it is proposed to review in connection with the derating proposals and the provision of a new source of revenue for Local Authorities are as follows :  (i) Assigned Revenue and Local Taxation Licence Grants.(ii) Grants under the Agricultural Rates Acts 1896 and 1923.(iii) The percentage grants in aid of health services* : Tuberculosis.Maternity and Child Welfare. Welfare of the Blind. Venereal Diseases. Mental Deficiency.* The grants in aid of port sanitary services and of training of midwives and health visitors as well as the Highlands and Islands (Medical Service) Grant will be continued on the present basis.(12/342)q a 4
. (iv) The classification grants for Class I and Class II roads in large burghs and the grants for the maintenance of scheduled roads -  . in County Districts.Exchequer grants other than the above-named will not be affected by the scheme.23. The Government propose to widen materially the scope of the Exchequer grants to make up the deficiency due to derating. They have considered how the principles which should regulate a proper system of Exchequer grants can be applied and in their view such a system should (i) recognise that a fair contribution should be made from theExchequer towards the cost of local services ;(ii) ensure that Local Authorities have complete financial interestin their administration;(iii) be adapted in its working to the needs of the areas as indicated by their general characteristics ;(iv) permit the greatest freedom of local administration and initiative ;(v) provide for sufficient general control and advice from theCentral Departments to ensure a reasonable standard of efficiency in administration. Accordingly it is proposed to abolish the existing Exchequer grants ,23. referred to in paragraph .26C24. The portions of the Assigned Revenue and Local Taxatio Licence Grants at present applied to education and police services amounting to about  598,000 are under present arrangements treated as part of and deducted from the grants which would otherwise be payable by the Scottish Education Department and Scottish Office in aid of education and police services and, on the abolition of the Assigned Revenues, it is proposed that the equivalent of the grants applied to these services should be paid by these Departments out of voted monies.25. The loss to the local authorities under the scheme will, therefore, be the rates on the rateable value lost under the derating proposals and 33- the grants specified in paragraph-SCTbther than the parts of the assigned Jlty revenues referred to in paragraph 227  In place of the rate and grant revenue so lost by local authorities it is proposed to substitute a new &apos; source of revenue an Exchequer grant-in-aid fixed in total and for each authority for a period of five years and revised both in total and for each authority every five years.26. The total sum to be distributed as the new grant-in-aid of revenue for the first quinquennial period will be made up of : (i) The estimated loss of rates due to derating which would have been incurred by all local authorities in the year 1928-29 (taken for the purposes of the scheme as &quot; the standard year &quot;) on the assumption that the proposed local govern-ment changes had been in operation in that year, and that the Valuation Roll* in force on the 1st October j 1929, had _been in force in that year.* This expression as used throughout the Memorandum means the Valuation Roll in force at 1st October, 1929, subject to such adjustments of the valuations therein contained as may be necessary to give effect to the derating scheme for a whole year.
(ii) The assigned revenue and local taxation licence grants payable for the standard year other than the grants specifically applied to education and police services.(iii) The Agricultural Rates Acts Grants payable for the standardyear.(iv) The Health Percentage Grants payable for the standard year.(v) The classification grants for Class I and Class II roads in large burghs and the maintenance grants for scheduled roads in county districts payable for the standard year, (vi) An additional sum of new money which for present purposes has been estimated at  750,000 for Scotland.The actual total sum to be distributed will not be known until the loss of rateable value has been ascertained and the figures for the standard year are available. The new money to be included in the grant will, however, not depend in any way on the other figures, but will be fixed in advance. Its amount will be eleven-eightieths of the new money available for England and Wales.APPORTIONMENT OF GRANT AMONG COUNTIES AND LARGE BURGHS.27. It is proposed that the whole of the new Exchequer grant-in-aid should in the first place be apportioned among counties and large burghs, this apportionment being ultimately according to a formula based on general characteristics independent of actual expenditure. In deciding what characteristics should be adopted and what weight should be given to each the aim has been so to adjust the distribution of this new revenue as to make the assistance vary with the need for local Government services in any area in relation to the ability of the area to meet the cost. After careful examination of a wide range of possible factors a combination of population, the proportion to the total population of children under five, and the rateable value per head of population has been taken as the main framework of the formula.To these factors of general application have been added two further factors of a special character, the one to allow for the additional burden thrown upon certain areas by abnormal unemployment, and the other for the considerable variations in the cost of certain local government services arising in counties from the differing density of the population. For the first purpose the proportion of unemployed insured men to total population according to Ministry of Labour returns has been adopted, and for the second the population per mile of public road as determined by the Ministry of Transport.28. These factors are combined in the proposed formula so as to arrive at a &quot; weighted population &quot; for each administrative county and large burgh and when the scheme is in full operation the total sum available will be apportioned among the administrative counties and large burghs on the basis of weighted population.(12/342)g a 5
Owing, however, to the very irregular distribution of the existing revenues to be replaced by the formula grant, it is considered that too great a disturbance in local finance would be caused by introducing a complete allocation on this basis at one step. It is accordingly proposed during the early years of the scheme, to base the grant allotted to ad-ministrative counties and large burghs partly on the present distribution of these revenues and partly on the formula. For the first quinquennial period the fixed annual grant will be made up of two parts. The first part will be equivalent to 75 per cent, of the loss of rates and grants in the standard year calculated as explained in paragraphs 36 and 37 below ; the second part, which in total will comprise the equivalent of 25 per cent, of the loss of rates and grants and the whole of the new Exchequer money, together roughly one-third of the whole grant, will be dis-tributed according to the formula. On each subsequent revision it is proposed that more and more of the total grant should be distributed on formula until by 1945 the whole would be distributed entirely on this basis.29. The full formula proposed is as follows :  (1) For each county and large burgh a figure of &quot; weighted popula-tiori &quot; is arrived at by increasing the population in the standard year as estimated by the Registrar-General  (a) by the percentage by which, at the last previous Census, the number of children under 5 years of age per 1,000 of the population of the area exceeded 50, and (6) by the percentage by which, according to the Valuation Roll in force on the 1st October, 1929, the rateable value per head of estimated population of the area is below  12 10s.* In the case of the county councils the population so increased is weighted by two further factors and in the case of the town councils of large burghs, by the first of these factors.(c) for unemployment ; the number of unemployed insured men is expressed as a percentage of total estimated population, and where this percentage, averaged over 3 years, exceeds 1^ per cent., the population as increased by (a) and (b) is further increased by a percentage equal to ten times the excess over 1-1 per cent.id) for low density of population.; where the estimated popula-tion per mile of roads is less than 100 persons the popula-tion as increased by (a) and (6) is further increased by the percentage by which the estimated population per mile of roads is less than 200 persons : and where the estimated population per mile of roads is 100 persons or more, by the percentage which 50 persons bears to the. estimated population per mile, of roads.* The average rental per head of population in Scotland is about 25 per cent, higher than the corresponding rental in England.  12 10s. has therefore been taken *s the equivalent of the  10 rental adopted for purposes of the scheme in England.
(2) The total amount of the formula grant to each large burgh and to each administrative county will be x pence multiplied by its weighted population. (The money factor x pence will be determined by the total sum available for distribution in Scotland on the formula basis.)As regards the elements of the formula :- (a) the number of children under 5 per 1,000 of the populationvaried from 41 to 140 at the last Census ; there were, however, only three areas in which the number was under 50 and accordingly that figure has been taken as a convenient minimum.(b) It is estimated that save in very few exceptional areas the reduced rateable value per head of population will be less than  12 10s.(c) The datum figure (1J per cent.) taken for the unemploy-ment loading is considerably below the average for the country at the present time (2-2 per cent.) and in the area of heaviest unemployment the weighting factor on the average of the last three years (excluding the period of the coal stoppage) would amount to 68 per cent.The heavy loading proposed for unemployment of ten times the percentage above the datum figure is due to the fact that in the first quinquennial period only about one-third of the total grant will be distributed under the formula. It is proposed that at each quinquennial revision, when a larger proportion of the total grant will be distributed under the formula, the basis of the loading for unemployment should be revised in relation to the total formula grant.(d) The loading for density in administrative counties will result in some loading being applied in all counties. The addition in the most sparsely populated county would amount to nearly 90 per cent, and in 21 counties the addition would exceed 50 per cent.Distribution to Small Burghs and Landward Area ok County.30. Out of the total amount allotted to each administrative county a grant will be made to each small burgh at a uniform rate per head of actual population and to the landward area of the county at two-thirds of the uniform rate per head of actual population. The aggregate of the grants paid to the small burghs and allocated to the landward area will then be deducted from the grant appropriate to the administrative county as a whole and the balance will be the grant available to the county council in aid of the general county rate to be levied over the whole area of the county (i.e., the landward area and the small burghs). The uni-form rate will be one-half the average rate ascertained by dividing the
total grant allotted to all administrative counties by the aggregate actual population of the counties.The foregoing proposals in regard to the distribution of the grant within each administrative county have been framed with special refer-ence to the very considerable changes in the incidence of rates within the county involved in the transfer of poor law, public health and certain highways to the county councils.MODIFICATION OF PROPOSALS, IN FIRST QUINQUENNIALPERIODS.31. For the first quinquennial period grant will be paid direct to the town council of each large burgh, to the county council and to the town council of each small burgh within the county : (a) The town council of each large burgh will receive a grant equi-valent to 75 per cent, of the loss of rates and grants in the standard year together with the formula grant appropriate to the &quot; weighted population &quot; of the burgh.(6) The town council of each small burgh in a county will receive a grant at a uniform rate per head of actual population. The uniform rate will be ascertained as explained in para-graph 30.(c) Each county council will receive a grant equivalent to 75 percent, of the loss of rates and grants in the standard year of the county council and the town councils and other autho-rities within the administrative county together with the formula grant at the full rate on the weighted population of the county, less the aggregate of the grants paid to the town councils of small burghs.(d) The balance of the total grant for the administrative countywill be applied as follows : (i) the landward area will be credited with a grant at two-thirds of the uniform rate referred to in paragraph 30 above.(ii) the remainder of the balance will, subject to certain minor adjustments referred to in paragraph 33, be applied in aid of the general county rate levied over the whole area of the county, i.e., the landward area and the small burghs.32. It is also proposed that in the case of any large burgh or adminis-trative county (as a whole) in which the allotted grant in aid does not exceed the aggregate loss of rates and grants in the standard year by a sum equivalent to Is. per head of actual population of the area, the allotted grant shall be increased by such a sum as will bring the net gam up to the equivalent of Is. per head of the population.As regards the small burghs and landward parishes within the administrative county it would, in view of the wide variation in the present
1poundage of rates in any one county, be impossible to guarantee that in every area there should be a decrease of rates consequent on the intro-duction of the scheme. Clearly, with equalisation of certain charges throughout the county some areas will gain and others will lose, but it is desired to spread the full financial effect of the scheme over as long a period as possible. It is, therefore, proposed that if the calculated rate poundage in the standard year in any burgh or parish shows an increase resulting from the scheme to the burgh or parish a separate special grant should be given of the money equivalent of the increase. One-half of the separate special grant in each county will be found by the Exchequer and the other half by deduction from the formula grant otherwise applicable to the burghs and parishes in the county in which the calculated rate poundage in the standard year shows a reduction resulting from the scheme. The deduction in each case will be proportional to the money equivalent of the rate reductions in the particular burghs and parishes. If in the case of any area the appropriate deduction exceeds the formula grant applicable to the area the excess will be found by the Exchequer. The special grant and the deductions from the formula grant will be reduced by one-fifteenth each year. In this way while certain areas will receive a substantial relief from the outset no area will suffer an increase of rate poundage by reason of the scheme when it comes into operation and the necessary adjustments will be spread gradually over a period of fifteen years. This special grant will be reduced by one fifteenth each year so that it will have entirely disappeared by the time the formula basis is applied to the whole of the money available. For the purpose of the special grant calculations will be made for each area-showing : (1) the total rate which would have been required for the expendi-ture of the standard year, if in that year the scheme had been in force and the rate had been levied on the basis of the reduced values which will take effect as from 1st October, 1929 ; and(2) the total rate which would have been required if in that year the rate had been levied on the basis of the unreduced values according to the Valuation Roll for 1929-30, under the arrangements existing prior to the scheme coming into force.The rates to which the scheme applies are the rates levied by Rating Authorities but do not include domestic water rates.33. In the case of landward areas the general scheme will apply to all rates except those raised for purely parochial or special district pur-poses. As regards rates levied in special districts or for parochial pur-poses it is proposed that for the first quinquennial period the County Council should receive an Exchequer Grant equivalent to 75 per cent, of the loss arising in the standard year from, the derating of certain of the properties on which those rates are levied and that the remaining 25 per cent, shall be a charge on the remanet of grant available to the county council.
34. As regards Joint Committees for Hospitals, etc., it is,not proposed that any Exchequer grant should be paid to the Committees. So.far as the contribution of the rating authorities to the Joint Committee is, based On valuation the aggregate loss of rates of the Joint Committee calculated for the standard year will be apportioned among the con-stituent rating authorities on the basis of the reduced rateable values which will have effect as from 1st October, 1929, and treated as loss of rates of the constituent rating authorities. The contributions of the constituent authorities after October, 1929, so far as based on valuation, will be calculated on the reduced rateable value.35. The total annual grant ascertained for any area in the manner explained will, at the inception of the scheme, be fixed for five years as from 16th May, 1930, except for any alterations of area or authority during the period. If any such alterations take place, suitable adjust-ments of the grants payable to the areas affected will be made. At the end of the first period of five years the total grant will be revised. The non-formula part of the grant to each area, i.e., the part directly proportional to the loss of rates and grants in the first standard year, will be reduced by one-third and the formula part will be increased. The total formula grant will then consist of the total amount of the previous formula grant, increased by the total amount taken from the non-formula grant, and by any new money which may be added. As regards the total sum to be distributed as grant-in-aid for the second quinquennial period (apart from the special grant given under the guarantee referred to in paragraph 30), it is proposed that broadly the ratio of total Exchequer assistance in aid of local government (apart from the special grant) to the total rate-borne expenditure of the country at the beginning of the scheme should at least be maintained, so that if there is any marked reduction in this ratio at the end of the first quin-quennial period not due to temporary abnormal causes, further Exchequer money will be added to the total annual sum available for distribution during the second quinquennial period to enable the ratio to be restored.The grant allotted to each county council and each large burgh will be re-calculated. The allocation of the formula grants will, of course, be made on the particulars of the area in a second standard year, probably 1934, the general basis of the formula remaining unchanged except that the unemployment weighting, as already explained, will require to be revised in relation to the total sum distributed under the formula. The method of distribution to the small burghs and the landward area of the county will remain unchanged, but the rate of grant will, of course, be re-calculated.As regards subsequent revisions of grant similar arrangements would apply. For the third quinquennial period there would be a further transfer from the non-formula part of the grant to the formula part and for the fourth period the whole of the grant would be distributed: on the formula basis. i
METHOD OF CALCULATION&quot; AND ADJUSTMENT.36. The rate deficiency in the standard year for the purpose of the scheme will be calculated as follows : (a) There will be ascertained the net rate-borne expenditure whichwould have been incurred by each spending authority [i.e., the county council acting as the general county authority and also as the authority for the landward area and the town council of each large and small burgh) in the year 1928-29 on the assumption that effect had been given to the pro-posed re-arrangement of local government services. Where an3*- parish is only partly within a county or large burgh the expenditure of the parish council in the standard year will for the purpose of this ascertainment be apportioned between the parts within and without the county or burgh on the basis of the reduced rateable valuation which will have effect as from 1st October, 1929.(b) The loss of rates in the standard year for each authority will be such proportion of the net expenditure so ascertained as the loss of rateable value due to derating according to the Valua-tion Roll in force on 1st October, 1929, bears to the total rateable value which, apart from the scheme, would have stood.in the Valuation Roll. In the case of a county the aggregates of the corresponding values in the Valuation Rolls of all the rating authorities within the county will be taken for the purpose of ascertaining the appropriate proportion.37. The loss of grants in the standard year will be the actual grants (for which the new scheme of grants is to be substituted) payable to each authority for the year 1928-29, subject to the following adjustments : (]) The Agricultural Rates Acts Grants applicable to expenditure on the services to be transferred to the county will be treated as grant payable to the county council acting partly as a general county authority and partly as a landward authority.(2) All Health Grants payable to authorities within an administrative ,   county will be treated as grants payable to the county council as general county authority.(3) Road Grants applicable to expenditure on unclassified roads in county districts will be treated as grants payable to the county council acting as a landward authority.(4) The grants to voluntary associations in aid of the Welfare of the Blind will be apportioned among county councils and town councils of large burghs according to the residence of the beneficiaries and treated as grants payable to these bodies.38. County councils and town councils of large burghs will be required to make contributions to the voluntary associations for the Blind. It is proposed that these contributions should as at present be made on a
capitation basis in accordance with, a scheme to be made by the Scottish Board of Health.39. Any grants under the existing scheme in respect of any period prior to 16th May, 1930, unpaid at that date will be paid. The grants payable under the new scheme will be ascertained, so far as they depend on local valuations and rates, from certified and audited returns furnished by local authorities and will be paid in six instalments during the financial year. It will be necessary to withhold some small part of the grant pending certification but the part withheld will not ordinarily exceed the remanet grant under the old scheme outstanding on 15th May, 1930, so that local authorities will receive a full year&apos;s grant revenue under the new scheme each year. The only conditions attaching to the grant will be the compliance with the general requirements of the new scheme and the efficient administration of the local services. Provision will be made for withholding some part of the grant in the event of a reasonable standard of efficiency not being maintained.40. The new general grant scheme will not come into force: until 16th May, 1930, but the derating provisions will operate as from 1st October, 1929. It will be necessary, therefore, to make transitional arrangements for the compensation of authorities for the loss of rates in the period 1st October, 1929, to 15th May, 1930. It is proposed that every county council, town council, parish council, education authority and district board of control should for that period receive a grant* equivalent to the full loss of rates calculated for the period of the standard year from 1st October, 1929, to 15th May, 1930. The calculation will be made as explained in paragraph 36 above, except that as the local government changes will not have been made there will be no transfer or apportionment of expenditure on poor law, public health and highway services. The grant will be payable in three instalments during the period referred to. and as there will probably be some delay in the ascertainment of the grant payable, payment on account will be made on the closest estimates available.41. As an illustration of the approximate effect of the scheme, calcu-lations have been made showing, on certain assumptions, what would have been the effect in certain areas if the scheme had been in operation in these areas in the year 1927-28 ; the grants to be withdrawn and the losses of rates are contrasted with the new grants under the scheme.Eor the purpose of this illustration the loss of rates has been roughly estimated from returns recently furnished by Rating Authorities. The formula grants for counties and large burghs which would have been payable under the scheme have been calculated on a money factor of 31-35(2. per head of weighted population for the year 1921.It is estimated that the aggregate of the formula grants on this basis would amount to about  2 million, which is roughly equivalent to 25 per cent, of the loss of rates and grants ( 1J million), together with  750,000 new Exchequer money.* The grant to the county council would be in respect of both general county rates and district rates.
The results of these calculations are shown in the Tables at the end of this memorandum for each of the 22 large burghs and for 8 counties. In the case of the counties figures are given showing : (1) The actual rate poundage for 1927-28 for each of the parishes and small burghs (405 in number) within those counties.(2) The estimated rate poundage which would have been required for 1927-28 under the scheme before payment of the special grant referred to in paragraph 32.(3) The estimated rate poundage after payment of the special grant.The grants to small burghs have been calculated at 173 pence per head of population, and the grants to landward areas at 115 pence per head of population.The eight counties have been selected as being typical and it is believed that the working of the financial scheme in counties generally is adequately illustrated by the Tables. The illustration is, of course, not intended to do more than give a rough picture of the position.42. On the assumptions on which the illustration is based it will be seen that in the case of each of the 22 large burghs the total grant is in excess of the loss. Two burghs would have gained between Is. and 2s. per head of population ; five between 2s. and 3s. ; four between 3s. and 4s. ; three between 4s. and 5s. ; and eight over 5s.As regards the eight selected counties, in each case the total grant shown for the county as a whole is in excess of the loss. The illustration shows that the general effect of the scheme of distribution will be to mitigate very considerably the changes in the incidence of rates due to the widening of the area of charge for poor law, public health and high-ways. The year 1927-28 is, of course, an unfavourable year to take for illustrating the working of any scheme so far as the mining areas are concerned inasmuch as it contains a considerable amount of abnormal expenditure resulting from the dispute of the previous year, and it may be expected that under more settled conditions the divergencies in the poundage of rates would be considerably less than those shown in the Tables for these areas.43. It is estimated that with the guarantees which it is proposed should be given the total additional cost of the scheme to the Exchequer over and above the equivalent of the loss of rates and grants on the calculations of 1927-28 would amount to about  1 million for Scotland.
