(ffris document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government),BT.,234(28) .CABINET.FACTORIES    BILL.Meoorandum by the Home Seoretary,My colleagues will remember that the Cabinet authorised me in 1926 to introduce the Government Bill for the amendment and consolidation of the Factory &amp; Workshop Act in Order that an opportunity might be given to the various interests affected to examine its provisions and to confer with me before the Bill was further proceeded with.     This opportunity was taken advantage of by the   Confederation  of Employers&apos;  Organisations, and the Bill was exhaustively discussed by them with representa-tives of the Home Office in a series of fifteen Conferences which lasted over the months of October, November and December, 1927.-    When this discussion was completed, the points raised were considered by the Home Office, and the modifications which the Department were prepared to recommend were indicated in general terms to the Employers representatives at a further series of five Conferences held in January of this year.     The result of the Conferences has been to clear up a number of points on which misunderstanding existed and to enable the Hone Office to suggest modifications which should go a long way to meet the difficulties of the Employers.      I am given to understand that while the Employers Organisations will not be able to accept everything in the Bill as it now stands and will feel bound to contest certain points in Committee,  they do not propose to offer any concerted opposition to the Bill as a whole, and I have., definite grounds for thinking that they, would be glad to see it passed during the currency of the present Parliament *The question which I must now ask my colleagues to consider is whether we should proceed with the Bill and secure its passage into law before the General Election.      To introduce the Bill with no intention of proceeding with it or to introduce
it and thereafter so to fix the date of the General Election that the parliamentary time available for its discussion would be inadequate would,  in my view be worse than useless.      The Bill is a modified form of the Government Bill introduced in 1926, which was in turn less stringent than the Bill   produced by the Labour Party in 1924.      Even if it be passed into law during this Parliament, the Government will have to face severe criticism from our political opponents who will not only attack us on the ground that the measure falls so far short of what is requisite, but will represent us as subservient to the big industrial interests in that we have omitted at the instance of the Employers provisions which in 1926 we considered necessary. That form of criticism we shall, in any event, have to face, but if we introduce the Bill and make no attempt to pass it or introduce it in circumstances which render its passage into law impossible, there will be added to the attack the charge that the Government have never been sincere in their intention to ameliorate, even to the extent., contemplated by their emasculated proposals, the conditions of the workers in the factories.For my own part, I would strongly urge that we should proceed with the Bill.     At the last Election, among the many pledges given, was one to pass a Bill to amend and consolidate the Factory &amp; Workshop Acts.      That pledge found its way into the King&apos;s speech at the beginning of the present Parliament, and has since, on more than one occasion, been affirmed.    It will be recalled that early in 1926 I stated on the authority of the Cabinet (Cabinet 10  (26), Conclusion 13), during the Second Reading Debate on.a Factories Bill introduced by Miss Wilkinson, that the Government would introduce a Bill of their own during that Session and would make it one of the early or principal measures of the following year.      Though it was found impracticable fully to implement that undertaking,the Bill was not abandoned and as recently as February of this year, the
Prime Minister during the Debate on the Address said he hoped it would be possible, if a new Session were commenced in IToveaber., that the Factories Bill might be dealt with before the end of next Session.The principal objection urged against proceeding with the Bill of 1926 was that it imposed, financial burdens on industry which industry was in no fit state to bear.     The position now has materially changed.     Not only have the financial burdens which would have been imposed by the Bill of 1926 been   sensibly diminished, but substantial relief is being afforded to industry by the Government Rating Scheme.     The Employers are, or will be therefore, in a far better position to give effect to the Bill than they were two years ago.      The main purpose  of the Rating Scheme would of course, be nullified if all that productive industry gained thereunder were to be absorbed in effecting the improvements in working conditions which the Bill requires.     The moderate nature of the Bill happily disposes of any such suggestion.     While, however, the Rating Scheme may contribute to make easier the position of the Government if they decide to go on with the Bill, it will make their position much more difficult if a contrary decision is reached.      It will be represented during   the  election campaign that the Government were only too ready to -initiate and   pass legislation - for which no pledge was given at the last election to put some 26 millions into the pockets of the &quot;Capitalist&quot; Employers, and were only too reluctant to honour a pledge given nearly five years ago and since repeated, to move the Employers to undertake expenditure on the bettering of working conditions in their factories.      I do not think that we can safely leave the Labour Party at the coming Election to point to the Rating Scheme on the one hand, and the Goal Mines Act and the Trades Disputes Act on the other, as typical of what Employers and Trade Unionists respectively may expect of a Conservative Government.      It seems to me that an amending Factories Bill is
urgently needed to help to balance the account.I have brought this matter to the attention of my  .. colleagues thus early because it is desirable in view of the time required by my Department to complete the necessary preparations that I should know the Government&apos; s decision as soon   now as possible.      There can be little question that if vre decide to go ahead with the Bill, the Bill should obtain a Second Reading in November in order that much of the Committee work may be done before Christmas.      If that course is followed, it should be possible to get the Bill on to the Statute Boole in the early Summer.      If the Second Reading is deferred until February, the prospects will not be any too bright, especially if it is decided to go to the country in the early Summer, and for the reasons I have already indicated it would be most inadvisable to introduce the Bill unless there were something more than a reasonable prospect of our being able to pass it into law before the Election.I need not trouble the Cabinet at this stage with comments on the alterations which have been made in the Bill as introduced in 1926, as the Bill will presumably be referred, to the Home Affairs Committee.    There is one important point, however, on which I must ask for a decision from the Cabinet, and that is the provision as to hours of employment of women and young persons.     The Bill of 1926 provided for a 4ft hours week and a 10 hours day.      This was strongly objected to by the Employers&apos; Organisations mainly on the ground that it conceded the principle of the 48 hour week which they were contesting in connection with the Washington Hours Convention and which they held should not be introduced by a side   wind in a Factories Bill.     An alterantive arrangement was suggested by the Employers which, with some modifications, has been embodied under the heading ^Second Alternative&quot; -in clause 68 of the revised draft attached.      This alternative omits any reference to weekly hours of work but would in fact allow a 51-g- hours
* 9Q16th July,  1928.week.      The figures in both oases are exclusive of &quot;overtime&quot;. The alternative would I believe be accepted by the Employers even if proposed by the Government as it would have to be with an express intimation that it was without prejudice to the consideration of the larger question involved in the Washington Convention.     On the other hand it has to be remembered that the Government have recently in connection with the discussions on the Washington Hours Convention, definitely declared themselves in favour of the principle of a 40 hour week, and if it is proposed in the Factories Bill to authorise a longer week, the, Government will have an obvious  criticism to meet.W.
