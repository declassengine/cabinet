A Method of Concentration.There appears to be a growing demand for safeguarding duties to be applied to the steel trade.   I am told that many of the users of steel in the engineering and even the shipbuilding:trades, are now prepared to support such a measure. :-     ,-.....       -? &apos; - Those in the trade in favour of safeguarding point to the increasing imports of foreign steel as the main cause of their inability to s produce at a lower cost and their diminishingpower of competition.     . &apos;*   ----    .......      .    i - ......... ^ &apos; - 0------ Others in the steel trade deprecate the immediate imposition of any safeguarding duty,which they say would retard rather than assist the recovery of the power of international competition of the British steel trade, and the reasons they advance are somewhat noveh and if well founded point to initial steps which might be taken without, political disturbance towards a remedy&apos; for what, in their opinion, is a most potent cause of - the present stagnation. -     - -        &apos;-, 1 --li - --  --&apos; - r -K -      &apos;.............:The argument runs that the market for British steel is, say, seven to eight million tons a year. The productive capacity of the existing works is twelve million tons a year. Internal competition is sufficient to prevent any one of the producers making steel beyond, say, 60 per cent, of capacity, with the consequence; that the costs of production are unduly high&apos;.--&quot;-- :----(&apos;- - * .      .     r.       ....   ......... -3....... ....(,. .\ ...If production could be concentrated in the most efficient works, so that there could be an output of 90-100 per cent, of capacity in those works, the cost might be reduced byperhaps Ii2 -a ton.  *-      -&apos;- -----  ;i -&apos;- - -    -----......--     -        ------ -r&quot;&apos;i  - Some works - are j already equipped to take advantage of such a position.  -Others would require more capital outlay, but their geographical position justifies their continued existence.-   Others,;again, should!be closed.-    -     -- -   -     -        - --4---&apos; The argument is that the existing works are effective competitors to the extent of preventing even the tmost efficient works from maintaining a regular and reliable output sufficient to ensure a permanent reduction in price, but they are ineffective for international competition except in specialities, and they actually prevent those that might be, with a bigger output, effective international units from so becoming........ ..   .(b28/17)   75   7/28   w.o.p. &quot;3767Copy, :No.    9 )THE CABINET.
Without concentration of output by some form of amalgamation of interests, it is said that a safeguarding tariff would be actually harmful, for it would keep alive the ineffectives and prolong the&apos; national competition of the works inter se, and . retard the time when international competition could be undertaken.I am told also that the steel industry is now largely dependent upon the banks, and the schemes of reorganization by Armstrong&apos;s, Baldwin&apos;s, Beardmore&apos;s, Ebbw Vale and Vickers have shown publicly how large has been the indebtedness of these important firms. I recollect that when the position of the banks was discussed in the enquiry by the Civil Research Committee, it was pointed out that it was not the duty of. the banks to put any pressure upon any of their clients to follow any particular trade policy, and that the banks scrupulously avoided any such action, and limited themselves to rendering what service they could by giving legitimate financial assistance to the steel companies.I am told that many of the companies are finding great difficulty in getting the extent of accommodation that they require, and it is obvious that after years of depression and heavy losses, the time must be approaching when the banks&apos; limits will be reached.If it be thought that rationalization is indeed the primary remedy for the present position of the steel companies, whether subsequently supported by a safeguarding duty or not, the difficulties of bringing about the necessary amalgamations must be faced.The Socialist Party would find in the present position confirmation for their claim that private enterprise has failed, and that nothing except amalgamation in some form of nationalization can compel unwilling directors to bring the interests of their several com-panies into one organization. The Socialist Party have been accustomed to use the coal industry as an example of the necessity for nationalization, and if they chose to couple with the coal industry the iron and steel trades, and show how the depreciation in the latter is affecting the former as well as the railways, they would have a formidable case if our only answer were that all these things must be left solely to the initiative of the private individuals directing companies, although the nation may be faced with an ever-growing problem of unemployment/and an increasing decrepitude in some of the industries most vital to the national safety in time of war.If, on the publication of the report of the Industrial Transference Board, the Socialist Party instituted a campaign on these lines, and if, as appears not improbable, unemployment increases throughout the winter, we might be faced at the neXt election with a position which would be formidable.We are bound by the Prime Ministers statement not to introduce safeguarding in the steel trade this side of the election, and to promise it or to promise enquiry into it after the election, is not alone enough if any considerable body of opinion amongst the steel makers and the steel users were to oppose it on the grounds which I have already mentioned, that amalgamation should come first.I do not pretend to have had any practical experience of the steel trade, but I am much impressed by the argument that individual firms have but little chance in inter-national competition with the massed units of continental producers, whether in production or in selling.I had hoped that the banks might depart from their former policy and might them-selves have taken some active steps to bring about amalgamations. Such attempts as have been made have: been abandoned in face of obvious difficulties and I fear also that the various companies with their directors with strongly individualistic ideas and divergent interests, many of whom see suicide for themslves in any large scale of amalgamation, will prevent, or at least delay so long as to render too late any purely voluntary concentration on their own initiative.
Can anything be usefully done to expedite amalgamations ? The key to the situation is in the hands of the banks, and a way might be found for them, by which they could maintain their policy of non-interference, and yet hand over the key to those who would use it. It is said that the banks are becoming more and more difficult when further financial facilities are asked for. Their position may be that they are only keeping alive many of the companies for fear of greater losses should they withdraw support.It might suit&apos; the banks to pool their loans or such of them as are moderately well secured, so that the closing down of any one firm should not result in a complete loss to one particular bank. If the loans were pooled by being taken over by a Steel Bank, and the banks refrained in future from giving financial facilities except through the Steel Bank, the Steel Bank would be in a position to dictate the terms upon which future facilities would be given to the trade, and would be in a position to insist upon amalgamations as a condition precedent to future support.The Board of the Steel Bank would be constituted by representatives of the steel industry, the joint stock banks and representatives of some of the London issuing houses. The issuing houses would have an essential part to play ; they would be independent and their experience in the work of amalgamation would be important ; they would also determine the future capitalisation of the industry and find the new money required. It is thought that  10,000,000 might be required. The Government might offer its assistance if necessar)&apos;, by extending a &quot; trade facilities&quot; guarantee to a prior short term debenture charged on the industry.It might he desirable that a Steel Trust should be formed to act as a holding company, and if, as is probable, such a holding company could finance itself after a few years, any loans from the Steel Bank could be repaid and the bank could be wound up, so that the joint stock banks could again resume their duties.This is a feasible scheme if the banks have come to the position when they realise that further individual finance is dangerous to themselves and useless to the industry as a whole.I need not fill in the details ; the object of the Steel Bank would not be to oust permanently the joint stock banks, but to pool temporarily their loans and be the means of finding the further capital required for an amalgamation of the industry. It would be able to use its financial powers by closing when necessary a particular works for the benefit of the others, without throwing the loss on any individual bank or wholly on a particular company. When the industry is reconstructed and the loans taken over by the holding company, the Steel Bank&apos;s functions would cease.L. W.-E.16ih July, 1928.
