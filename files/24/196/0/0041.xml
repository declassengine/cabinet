Railway Company and Coast Lines, Ltd9 under which those Companies would jointly undertake the services hitherto performed, under contract with the Government, by Messrs. David MacBrayne,, LtdaIt will be convenient, for comparison, to indicate In parallel columns the main terms of the new proposal and of the agreement which had been made with Messrs. MaoBrayne prior to the recent Debate and the appointment of the Select Committee -New Proposal,Ma eBr a^ne Agre erne nt1.L.M. &amp; S and Coast Lines acting jointly on a half, and-half basis.2.

New Proposal,6.    Interest to be limitedto bfot      Profits over and above interest payments and amounts placed to reserve for depreciation etc, to go to reduction of freights or other, benefitsu     Accounts to be inspected by an accountant 6MacBrayne Agreement e6 o    Nil0     The Company have stated that their dividend has never exceeded 5% in recent years, but they have declined to produce their books for examinat ion.I understand that there is a possibility of the percentage reduction of freig?ats and fares being inoreased to 12^f0a but even without such enlargement of the offer the terms suggested merit careful consIderation, It will be a question for examination, of course, whether any, and if so, what modifications should be made with a view to redueing the cost to the State, and until the Select Committee has reported and the matter has been thoroughly Investigated, no final decision can be taken0The position at the moment, however, is that the whole proposal Is subject to an absolute stipulation by the L.M.S. Railway Company that they shall be absolved of all cost In obtaining any powers necessary to enable them to co-operate in the undertaking,.      It ia not clear whether a Private Bill or a Public (hybrid) Bill will be required, but in either case the Company Insist that the cost shall be defrayed by the State *      On this question it is of urgent liaportance tbiat I should obtain the Cabinet !s decision at once, as the Select Committee Js further proceedings and Report will depend upon it.     They an$ meeting tomorrow to consider tb^ companies &apos; proposals furtjSer, and I have been
asked to let them know before then whether the Government will be ready to accept the condition precedent, as otherwise the whole scheme will fall.On my present information I can see no likelihood of any other scheme maturing which would be acceptable both to the Government and to public opinion.     The condition is not in itself unreasonable, when it is kept in view that the companies have no commercial incentive to go into this undertaking;   arid while it Is impossible to forecast what expenditure would be involved, I see no reason to anticipate that serious opposition of the. kind which would Increase legislation costs would be likely to arise.      On these grounds I feel justified In pressing my colleagues to authorise me to say that the companies will be absolved of the costs of obtaining powers If a scheme involving legislation should ultimately be agreed upon,(Signed)      JOHN GILMOUR.Scottish Office3July 18th,  1958,
