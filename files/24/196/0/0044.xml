(Memorandum by the Minister of labour). 1.     On the 16th June I circulated a memorandum (CP.188(28)) on the unemployment situation, drawing attention to the unsatis-factory trend of the unemployment figures.     One of the consequences of the increase in these figures and of the general trade situation is that we are likely to exceed the borrowing powers attaching to the Unemployment Fund.     I mentioned this point to the Cabinet when my earlier paper was under discussion. The borrowing powers are limited by statute to  30 millions, and the debt stands at present at very nearly  26 millions.    It will be necessary to introduce a Bill to increase the borrowing powers, and if the figures continue to increase as they have done in recent weeks we shall need the Bill at the beginning of the Session.2.     The position has been discussed departmentally with the treasury, and it is felt that, on any reasonable forecast of the course of ecrployment, the two Departments, by one means or another, will be able to finance the necessary payments of benefit until the end of November.3.     It is most unsatisfactory to have to contemplate an increase in the borrowing powers and it will be necessary to re-examine &quot;Che finances of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, for we clearly cannot contemplate the continuance of a burden of debt of this kind, pointing as it does to a wrong relation-ship between revenue and expenditure.    The load of unemployment which we have carried, and are carrying, requires either a higher level of contributions or a lower level of benefits.(Int d, ) A. S-MoMinistry of Labour. 19th July, 1920.
