IMPERIAL WIRELESS AND CABLE CONFERENCE, 1928.SECRET REPORT.I. Introduction.Terms of Reference.1.   WE were appointed : &quot; To examine the situation which has arisen as a result of the competition of the Beam Wireless with the Cable Services, to report thereon and to make recommendations with a view to a common policy being adopted by the various Governments concerned.&quot;We accordingly submit the following secret Report: * Meetings.2. We held our first meeting on Monday, the 16th January, 1928, and decided, in the first instance, to address communications to the Cable and Wireless interests concerned, enquiring whether they wished to give evidence before the Conference.As a result of these enquiries, representatives of the following companies attended meetings of the Conference and explained the nature and status of their undertakings, their relationship with the Governments concerned, and their views in regard to the problems before the Conference : The Eastern and Associated. Telegraph Companies. The Indo-European Telegraph Company. Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph Company. The Canadian Marconi Company.The Wireless Telegraph Company of South Africa. ^The Indian Radio Telegraph Company.Memoranda or written representations were submitted on behalf of each of the above Companies, and information was also furnished on behalf of the Pacific Cable Board.The Board of Directors of the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia), Ltd., considered that for proper representation to be made on their behalf it would be necessary for someone thoroughly acquainted with the subject and having direct knowledge of the Board&apos;s views to travel from Australia to England, which could not be done under four months. The Conference was unable to suspend its deliberations for this purpose.3. The Conference held 34 meetings. A list of persons who have attended these meetings as witnesses is attached as Appendix &quot; A.&quot;4. The Conference also received a deputation from the Empire Press Union, the Executive of which had previously submitted a statement of their views, and communications were received from the Federation of. British Industries and the London Chamber of Commerce, submitting views and resolutions relating to the problems before the Conference.* We have also prepared a version (I.W.O. (28) 80) which in our opinion is suitable for publication.[17874]     . b
II. The Problem.Telegraph Systems of the Empire.5. At the time when the Conference assembled, the situation in regard to cable and wireless communication between the various parts of the Empire had been fundamentally affected by the opening of the Imperial &quot;Beam &quot; wireless services.6. Before the advent of the &quot; Beam,&quot; telegraphic communication depended upon the following services : (a.) Great Britain and Canada.(i.) The two &quot;Imperial&quot; transatlantic cables* owned by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain.,(ii.) A long-wave wireless service, conducted in Great Britain by Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph Company, and in Canada by the Canadian Marconi Company;(iii.) Cables of two American Companies, viz., the Commercial Cable Company and the Western Union Telegraph Company;(iv.) Cables of the Anglo-American Telegraph Company (British), leased for 99 years, from the 1st April, 1911, to the Western Union Telegraph Company.(b.) Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand.(i.) The cables to Canada referred to in (a) above, thence across Canada, land lines, rented from the Canadian Pacific Railway, and thence the cable of the Pacific Cable Board between Barniield (British Columbia)1 and Southport (Queensland), Sydney (New South Wales), and Auckland (New Zealand). (The Imperial Trans-Atlantic Cable, the land lines across Canada and the Pacific Cable Board&apos;s system thus provide an &quot; All Red &quot; route, no part of which lies in foreign territory);(ii.) The system of the Eastern Telegraph Company and its Associated Companies.(c.) Gredt Britain and, South Africa.The cables of the Eastern and Associated group of Companies.(d.) Great Britain and India.(i.) The cables of the Eastern Telegraph Company; and(ii.) The overland route maintained by the Indo-European Telegraph Company and the Indo-European Telegraph Department of the Government of India.The Imperial Beam Wireless Services.7. On the 25th October, 1926, the Anglo-Canadian Beam service was opened, the operation being undertaken by the General Post Office in Great Britain and by the Canadian Marconi Company in Canada. The wireless rates remained the same as those by cable. The long-wave wireless service, previously operated between the Marconi Company in England and the Canadian Marconi Company, was then terminated.8.   Three further services were opened on the following dates in 1927 : Great Britain-Australia : 8th April. Great Britain-South Africa : 5th July. Great Britain-India :   6th September.9. The following table shows the reductions which have been made in full-rate charges to and from Great Britain :- Cable rates, January 1927    &apos; Present cable rates   ... Beam wireless rates ...* Of these, No. 1 consists mainly of an ex-German cable by way of the Azores which formerly connected Germany and the CJ.S.A., but was ,cut at sea on the outbreak of. war in 1914 and subsequently linked at the eastern end with Penzance and at the western end with Halifax, Nova Scotia. No 2 also connects Penzance and Halifax, by way of Harbour Grace, Newfoundland, and was purchased as an auxiliary cable in 1920.Australia.	South Africa.

MarconFs &quot;Wireless Telegraph Company...Lazard Brothers and Company ... The Whitehall Trust Company ... Radio Corporation of America ...The &quot;B &quot; shares (held by the Marconi Company and the Radio Corporation of America) carry no voting rights. An Agreement had been prepared, but not yet executed, placing the &quot; A &quot; shares in a Voting Trust to last for 25 years, as a means of rendering more secure the British control of the Canmar Investment Company.Roughly, on this basis, the resultant position appears to be: Marconi Company   ... Lazard BrothersWhitehall Trust      ... .....Radio Corporation of America Not ascertained (general public)* In the case of the Pacific Cable this reduction was effected on the 1st February, 1927 (t.e., prior to the inception of the &quot; Beam &quot; service to Australia) and was a result of the completion of the new cable at the end of 1926.[17874] B 2	Number of	Value.

The Beam full rate for these three services is thus cheaper by Id. to lOd. a word than the old rates, and the cable rates have been brought down by 3d. to Qd. a word.* There is a uniform difference of 4:d. a word on each of the three services between the present cable and wireless charge for full-rate traffic, a uniform difference of 2d. for deferred traffic, and differences ranging from %d. to \d. for letter telegrams and Press telegrams.The Operation of the Beam Services.11. In Great Britain the Beam stations are owned and operated by the Government, the General Post Office being the responsible Department. The Agreement under which the stations were constructed for the Government by the Marconi Company, provides that the rates for traffic are to be fixed by the Postmaster-General in such a way as to &quot; attract the largest possible volume of traffic, with due regard to economic considerations.&quot;12. In Canada the Imperial Beam Service is operated by the Canadian Marconi Company, under a licence renewable on the first of April in each year. All tariff charges are subject to the approval of the Canadian Board of Railway Commissioners. All operators must be British subjects. The licence conveys no monopoly and may not be assigned. The existing rates are specified in an agreement between the Company and the General Post Office in London and may be altered by agreement in writing.13. As to the ownership and control of the Canadian Marconi Company, the Conference was given the following information : Number of Value.Shares. Dollars.The Company has an authorised share capital of       ...         ...         ... 7,500,000 7,500,000The issued share capital is   ...          ... 4,510,000 4,510,000 -Of the issued shares 51 per cent, are heldby the Canmar Investment Com-pany, viz,:      ...          ...         ... 2,300,000 2,300,000And the amount in the hands of thegeneral public is 49 per cent, viz. : 2,210,000 2,210,000 The Canmar Investment Company hasan authorised share capital of-&quot;A&quot; 6 per cent, non-cumulativepreference shares    ...          ... 5,000 500,000&quot; B &quot; ordinary shares    ...          ... 18,500All the authorised capital has been issued, with the exception of 500- &quot;B&quot; shares.   It is held as follows : 
14. In Australia the service is operated by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia), Ltd. All rates are subject to the approval of the Commonwealth Government. No Department of the Commonwealth may carry on any commercial wireless service in competition with the Company. The ownership of the shares is as follows : Commonwealth Government ...       500,001 shares.Marconi Company (about) ...      170,000     ,,General public (about) ...      329,999     ,,Three Directors are appointed by the Government and three by other share-holders ; the six Directors so appointed select a seventh by majority vote,15. In the Union of South Africa the service is conducted by the Wireless Telegraph Company of South Africa, under a licence valid for one year and renewable subject to stated conditions. Rates which may not be exceeded are stated in the licence. Under the terms of the licence, the Company undertake &quot; to employ South African nationals .... provided that the Postmaster-General may agree to the employment of British subjects other than South African nationals if he is satisfied that this is desirable in any particular case. . . .&quot; The stations may not be allowed to pass into other control without the prior consent of the Government. The Marconi Company holds practically all the shares issued ( 200,000).16. The Beam service in India is operated by the Indian Radio Telegraph Company, under an agreement extending to ten years (from the 6th September, 1927), in the first place. The charges are to be fixed by the Indian Government in such a way as to &apos;&apos; attract the largest volume of traffic with due regard for economic considerations.&quot; All Officers and Directors must be British subjects. The Company may not be a party to any commercial trust or combine without the prior consent of the Government.17. The existing rates, which have received the approval of the Government of India, are specified in an agreement (also valid until September 1937) between the Company and the General Post Office in London, and may be altered by joint consent, the approval of the Government of India having been previously secured by the Company. The share capital is  300,000, of which about  200,000 is understood to be held by the Marconi Company and about  100,000 by shareholders in India.The Effect of the Beam Services upon the Cable Systems.18. The traffic transmitted by the Beam Services has been approximately at the following rates per annum :-September-November March-May1927. 1928.Canadian service    ... 5 million words 6 million wordsAustralian service   ... 8     ,,        ,, 9     ,,        ,,South African service 9    ;,,        ,, 9     ,,        ,,Indian service        ... *9     ,,        ,, 10^   ,,        ,,19. The&apos;annual gross income which the General Post Office in London and the Beam Companies would derive from the above-mentioned (1928) volume of wireless traffic would be, roughly : G.P.Oi Wireless      Companies&apos;       Total Wireless Service. Revenue.t Revenue. Revenue.

20. Before the opening of the Beam services, the cables were working with a large margin of annual surplus, and there is evidence that the introduction of cheaper rates has already led to an appreciable increase in the total volume of telegraph traffic. But in spite of this it has been represented to us. that the cable undertakings affected and the Indo-European landline service have been brought to a serious position by the two-fold reduction in their receipts resulting from the operation of the lower rates introduced as a means of countering Beam competition^ and also from the loss of a considerable volume of traffic.to the Beam services. It should, however, be observed with regard to the Canadian service, where wireless and cable rates are the same, that no crisis has at present arisen. The reduction of revenue due to diversion of traffic appears, from statements furnished to us, to be of the following order :  	Australia.	South Africa.	India.	Total.	 		&apos;   &quot; &apos;	 Imperial Cables         ..          ..	34,000			34,000Pacific Gables	94,000			94,000Indo-European Department			3 6,000   -	16,000Indo-Europeau Company-			28,000	28,000Eastern and Associated Companies	127,000	145,000	165,000	437,000Total	235,000	145,000	209,000	609,00021. The diminution of revenue due to reduction of rates resulting from Beam competition was estimated in the case of the Eastern and Associated Companies to be at the rate of nearly  225,000 per annum, making a total estimated reduction of  662,000 in their annual revenue. Owing to the operation of joint purse arrange-ments, principally with the Indo-European Telegraph Department of the Government of India and the Indo-European Telegraph Company, the effect upon the actual revenue of Eastern Companies would, we were informed, be less unfavourable to the extent of some  150,000, the other partners in the Joint Purses being affected adversely to the same extent.22. The Pacific Cable Board finished the financial year 1927-28 with a small profit in addition to payment of full amortization owing to drastic economies and to the fact that they had budgeted for a surplus of  100,000 -the realised surplus&apos; of 1926-27!23. On the other hand the present Beam rates on the Australian, South African and Indian services assuming the existing traffic to be maintained or the increase to be continued yield a very high profit, and these rates could be substantially reduced and still give a handsome return on the capital invested in the Bean under -takings. It follows that the Beam services could always afford to undercut the cable rates, and, if competition were unrestricted could render the cable systems unremunerative. Haying regard to these considerations it was suggested to us that those responsible for the Cable Companies might prefer, unless a satisfactory means of obviating the effect of acute competition could be provided, to liquidate their undertakings at once and distribute their large reserves among their shareholders, rather than to remain in operation and dissipate their resources. The financial position of the Eastern Telegraph and Associated Companies is such that they have invested funds surplus to the requirements of their business amounting to over fifteen and a half million pounds, which would be available for distribution amongst shareholders whose nominal capital amounts to twelve million pounds.The Necessity for the Retention of the Cable Systems.24. The strategic aspects of the problem have already been examined by a special sub-Committee of the Imperial Communications Committee, whose reports show that the bulk of the important trunk cables must be retained for the maintenance of vital communications in time of war. Moreover, there are many parts of the -Empire (besides foreign countries served by the Eastern system) which are not at* Except in the case of the Pacific Cable see note to paragraph 10.
present, and may not for some time to come be, served by wireless. Further, the-existing wireless services are subject to fading and occasional prolonged inter-ruptions, which would be a serious hindrance to urgent commercial telegrams if the cables were not available. To sum up, therefore, it may he said that wireless offers a cheap service but not all-sufficing. It remains important for strategical and commercial purposes that the majority of the cables should be kept in operation.The Threat from Foreign Enterprise.25. In this connection information has been laid before us which points to an. attempt on the part of certain foreign interests to secure an increased share in the control and operation of world communications. There can be. no doubt that British Cable and Wireless Companies will have to face increasingly keen competition from foreign interests. It is obvious that, if the Eastern and Associated Telegraph Companies went into voluntary liquidation and wished to dispose of their assets, the opportunities presented to foreign interests to strengthen their position would be considerable. It is true that in the case of the cables landing on British territory, licences could be withheld from any foreign purchaser; but the sale to such a purchaser of cables which land at both ends on foreign territory could hardly be prevented. Moreover, it has to be borne in mind that the purchaser of a cable landing in British territory could in certain instances divert the cable to foreign territory.Summary of the Problem.26. The main features of the situation referred to us for examination and report may be summarised, therefore, as follows :  (a.) The Cable undertakings operating between the constituent parts of the British Empire would be unable to continue on a paying basis in face of unrestricted competition on the part of Beam Wireless Services.(b.) The financial position of the Eastern and Associated Telegraph Companies is such that they can go into voluntary liquidation at the present moment and refund to their shareholders from their reserves a sum in excess of the nominal value of their shareholdings.(c.) There are indications that foreign enterprise is attempting to secure increased control of communications and might be only too ready to seize any opportunity to acquire such part of the Eastern and Associated Companies&apos; system as could be transferred to a foreign purchaser.(d.). Owing to the lack of complete secrecy and certainty, &quot; Wireless&quot; is not yet in a position entirely to supersede cables. Cables are therefore at present . essential for the maintenance of necessary communications between the constituent parts of the Empire in the event of war and also for general commercial purposes.III. Possible Courses of Action by the Governments concerned.27. Broadly speaking, there are five ways in which the Governments concerned might deal with this situation, viz. :  (a.) Non-intervention. To refrain from any intervention and allow economic causes to decide the issue.(b.) Subsidy. -To assist the cables to remain in operation until such time as they may no longer be required owing to developments in wireless.(c.) Minimum Revenue Guarantee. To check the inroads of competition, mainly by Government control of wireless and cable rates, respectively, and to give an undertaking that should the disparity between the tariffs lead to a large diversion of traffic from the cables, the Governments would undertake responsibility for making up an agreed standard revenue to the cables.(d.). Pooling Scheme.-To diminish the force of wireless competition on the Imperial routes by sharing part of the&apos;joint revenue of the Beam and cable services.(e.) Fusion. To amalgamate so far as possible in one undertaking all the cable and wireless interests conducting communications between the various parts of the Empire so as to secure unity of control and unity of direction.
We propose to examine each of these seriatim:-28. Non-Intervention. -If no action were taken by the Governments, there would be an immediate danger of the following consequences ensuing : The Eastern Telegraph Companies, seeing no likelihood of a successful issue, might immediately go into voluntary liquidation, while their reserves still remained intact. Their physical assets might be put up for sale, and the Governments of the parts of the Empire concerned would then be faced with the alternative of purchasing the essential portion of these assets or seeing them pass into other probably foreign hands. We assume that neither of these alternatives would be acceptable to the Governments concerned, and that, therefore, this course may be summarily dismissed.29. Subsidy. We assume that a subsidy to the cables would prove as unaccept-able to the Governments as the prospect of purchasing the essential assets of the Cable Companies, as indicated in paragraph 28 above, and that therefore it also can be dismissed.30. Minimum Revenue Guarantee. A solution of the problem was considered on this basis. The main principles of the scheme were to ascertain the minimum revenue on which the Cable Companies might be induced to carry on for a term of years, giving them an opportunity to safeguard their profits by efficient administration. It was proposed that the Governments concerned should exercise control of wireless rates and thereby hold the balance of cable and wireless earnings in such a manner as might save them from financial obligation. An examination of the finances of the Eastern Companies led us to the conclusion that in all probability the Governments concerned would be called upon to make contributions to the minimum revenue fund at a comparatively early date.31. Pooling. With regard to pooling, we have given consideration to the possibility of a scheme Of &quot; joint purses,&quot; by which the earnings of the cable and wireless services upon specified routes might be shared in such a way as to secure to the Cable Companies a reasonable but not luxurious return on their capital and to the Public prospective reductions in rates as traffic and revenue expand. Such a scheme, it was suggested, would provide a modus vivendi which would tide over the next few years without cramping development, while at the same time leaving the Govern-ments concerned free to revise their policy at the end of the agreed period in the light of scientific developments and economic changes. It would be difficult, on the other hand, to ascertain the precise financial prospects of these Pools and the possibility of a contingent guarantee of their solvency, on the part of the Governments concerned, might arise. Moreover, it is impossible to realise as large economies from any pooling scheme as might be achieved by complete amalgamation. Further unity of control and unity of direction and administration cannot be achieved by this means, and thus the union, such as it is, is not free to turn all its resources and energies either to con-ducting a large public service or to facing external competition from foreign enterprises.32. Fusion. An amalgamation in one undertaking of all the cable and wireless interests conducting communications between the various parts of the Empire would avoid most of the objections which we have raised in the preceding paragraphs. By such an arrangement unity of control and unity of direction would be secured. The continuance of the cable system would be assured, economies could be effected, and the creation of a common purse and a common interest would leave the union free to devote its united energies to resist encroachments on the part of foreign competitors. It is along the lines of some such arrangement as this that we see the best chances of conserving and improving the communication services of the Empire without entailing contributions from public funds. Further there should be reasonable prospects of securing reductions in telegraphic rates.On the other hand, the amalgamation, being in the nature of a monopoly, necessarily gives rise to apprehension concerning the safeguarding of public interests. We feel, however, that, wide as the ramifications of such an amalgamated under-taking may be, means and measures can be devised which will guarantee to the communities concerned an efficient service at a reasonable cost.33. To sum up, therefore, it may.be said that, of the five possible courses, the first two Non-intervention and Subsidy are clearly not such as we could recom-
mend; the third and fourth Minimum Revenue Guarantee and Pooling System__might offer temporary solutions without, however, dealing radically with the case; while the fifth Fusion if acceptable to the Governments concerned, seems to us to form the basis of a permanent settlement of the problem which has been referred to us.34. It will be appreciated that, while the adoption of any one of the third, fourth or fifth courses would be facilitated by a merger of the Eastern and Marconi groups, the fifth involves consideration of policy in regard to the disposal of Govern-ment-owned assets, such as the Pacific Cable Board&apos;s system, the Imperial Trans-Atlantic Cables, the General Post Office &quot; Beam &quot; installations in Great Britain and the Government-owned Cable and Wireless systems in the West Indies, We deal below with these aspects of the question.IV. Developments while the Conference was in Session.Proposed Lease of Pacific Cable Board&apos;s System.35. In the course of our preliminary examinations we came to the conclusion that it would be desirable, as part of any arrangement which might be made with the Eastern Telegraph Companies, at any rate to lease the Pacific Cable Board&apos;s system to those Companies. We accordingly addressed a telegraphic communication to the Governments concerned enquiring whether they would view with favour an arrange-ment the main features of which should be that the Eastern Telegraph Companies would assume responsibility for the repayment to His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain of the outstanding capital advance and deficits, would maintain the Pacific Cable Board&apos;s system, and would guarantee the Board against loss. The full telegram and the replies thereto are set out in Appendix &quot; B,&quot; from which it will be seen that all the partner Governments approved the proposal, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in Great Britain adding that satisfactory arrangements would at the same time have to be made for the protection of the Imperial Atlantic Cables.Proposed Merger between the Eastern and Associated Telegraph Companies and Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph Company.36. As indicated above in paragraph 34, we formed the opinion that a merger between the Eastern Telegraph Companies and Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph Company, negotiations towards which had been instituted by the Companies them-selves, before the first meeting of the Conference, would facilitate the solution of the problem referred to us, provided satisfactory arrangements were secured to safeguard the interests of the Governments and Public. We accordingly addressed a further communication to the Governments represented on the Conference, setting out the considerations which had prompted us to form this opinion, and enquiring whether any objection was entertained to a solution being sought on this basis. Our telegram and the replies thereto are attached as Appendix &quot; C.&quot; These replies showed that, with the exception of the Government of the Union of South Africa, the remaining Governments entertained no objection to a solution of the problem being sought on the basis of a merger between the two Companies.37. On the day that these replies were being considered by the Conference we received a letter signed jointly by the Chairman of the two Companies, to the effect that a merger between them had been arranged subject to certain conditions. The terms of this letter are set out below : Dear Sir, London, E.C. 2, March 14, 1928.We beg to advise you that the negotiations between the Eastern and Associated Cable Companies and the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company have resulted, on the recommendation of Sir William Plender and Sir Gilbert Garnsey, in an agreement having been reached between the Boards of the two groups providing for a fusion of the interests of the Companies through the medium of a proposed Holding Company.The Agreement so arrived at is subject to satisfactory arrangements being made with the British Government and the Governments of the Dominions and India, and also to acceptance by the Stock and Shareholders of the Cable-Companies and of the Marconi Company.Yours faithfully, J. Denison Pender, Chairman, Inverforth, Chairman,\      Eastern Associated Cable Companies.     Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph Co,     \

Non-Cumulative &quot;A&quot; Ordinary Shares of  1 each :     . - -13,200,000 to Eastern and Associated Telegraph Companies. : 8,000,000 to Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph Co., Ltd.. 21,200,000[17874]this merger, both in respect of the conditions stipulated and of the proposed capitalisation, has so important a bearing on the problem referred to us that we consider it requires examination in some detail.Conditions attached to the Merger.38. It will be noted that the letter announcing the merger definitely states that it is &quot; subject to satisfactory arrangements being made with the British Government and the Governments of the Dominions and India.&quot; These &quot; satisfactory arrange-ments,&quot; on enquiry, were stated by the Companies to be : &quot; (a.) The creation of an Imperial authority representative of the Home Government and of the Dominions and India, to advise the Companies on all questions of general policy affecting Empire external telegraphic and telephonic communications, such as the institution of new services, the opening of new routes, the linking-up of the scattered parts of the Empire with the great trunk services, and the control of the services in the event of war or other national emergency.  This Imperial authority to advise in the fixing of rates.(&amp;.) The Companies also suggest that it would be desirable, both; as-increasing the authority of the New Company and as providing a liaison between the Company and the Governments, that there should be Government represen-tation on the Board of the New Company in the United Kingdom, and upon the Boards of the existing Wireless Companies operating in the Dominions and India.(c.) The New Company to take over and work from central offices in London, all present and future external telegraph and telephone services of the United Kingdom, both cable and-wireless. The licence to the Company to be for a minimum period of 25 years, renewable for further periods of 10 years.(d.) The New Company to purchase outright, on terms to be agreed, the Beam installations now operated by the Post Office in this country, and the wireless installations now operating with the Continent.(e.) The New Company agrees to lease the system of the Pacific Cable Board (including an assumption by the Company of the capital repayment sums to the British Government) on terms to be agreed. The Company is prepared to consider the leasing of the Imperial Atlantic cables on terms to be agreed.(/.) In the Dominions and India, the operation of the cable and wireless services to be centralised in each case and to be conducted by the existing local companies, if desired by the local Governments, the cable and wireless staffs being merged together for this purpose.(g.) The Governments of India, South Africa and Canada to be asked to extend the licence to the existing companies to a minimum period of 25 years with an extension for further periods of ten years.&quot;The proposed Capitalisation of the Merger.39. The proposed extent and allocation of capital in the new Company was communicated to us, and has been announced in the Press, in the following form :  Proposed Allocation of Capital in neio Company to Cable Companies andMarconi&apos;s respectively.       &apos; -5j per Cent.

From Marconi Company the whole of its Ordinary, Preference and Debenture Capital, which would be satisfied out of the above consideration.(2.) From the Cable Companies the whole of their Ordinary Share Capitals, &apos; leaving the Preference and Debenture issues undisturbed.The Board of the New Company to be nominated as to 12 members by the Cable Companies, and as to 8 members by the Marconi Company.\ 40. . Having regard to the large sums involved and the intricacy of the accounts on which they are founded, we thought it advisable to enlist the assistance of experts, who are recognised authorities in matters of finance and accountancy, to examine the basis of the proposed fusion with a view primarily to determining the justifica-tion of the respective share issues to be made on behalf of the two groups in the merger. We were fortunate in being able to secure the services of Sir O. E. Niemeyer, G.B.E., K.C.B., and Sir William McLintock, K.B.E., C.V.O., for this purpose.Beam Wireless and Cable Assets of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain.41. As indicated in paragraph 34 any scheme of complete fusion would entail also a transfer in regard to ownership or management of the &quot; Beam&quot; Wireless and Cable Assets, belonging to His Majesty&apos;s. Government in Great Britain. It will be observed that the arrangements contemplated by the Eastern and Marconi Companies included a transfer to them of these assets; and it is possible that unless the &quot;Beam&quot; installations were transferred to the new company the merger would not in fact take place.Such a transfer would involve for His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain a definite departure from the policy hitherto adopted in regard ,to the conduct of wireless services. We felt therefore that no useful purpose would be served in pursuing the consideration of such an arrangement until we were advised as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain towards it.42. Our Chairman was good enough to raise: this point with His - Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain and as a result informed us that no objection in principle to the merger or to the transfer thereto by that Government of then&quot;
Imperial and Pacific Cable assets and Beam stations would be raised, subject to the following conditions :  (1.) An agreement both in regard to principle and terms satisfactory to theGovernments represented at the Conference. (2.) The transfer to the merger by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great britain of their Imperial and Pacific Cable assets and Beam stations, the transferof the Beam to take the form of a lease for a period of years, theterms of which should include the payment of a royalty on communicationservices both wireless and cable. (3.) Some satisfactory scheme for controlling rates, the. details of which wouldbe worked out by the Imperial Wireless Conference. (4.) Approval by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain, who would be advised by experts, of the arrangements for the capitalization&apos;of the merger Company.(5.) Approval by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain of the individuals nominated as Chairman and Members of the Board of the Company in the i first instance as well as power of veto on future appointments to theBoard.(6.) The conduct of wireless telephonic Services to be reserved to the Government and the merger accordingly to be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in Great Britain is not prepared to sell or lease any form of communication by means of telephony and will require as a condition of the lease of the Beam Telegraphic Services that provision shall be made&apos; for the use of the Company&apos;s Wireless Telegraph stations or portions thereof by His Majesty&apos;s Government, if desired, for telephonic purposes on royalty terms.(7.) Adequate and satisfactory safeguards against possible foreign control.43. We communicated this decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain to the other Governments concerned and intimated that we proposed to institute negotiations with a view to ascertaining whether a satisfactory arrange-ment could be reached on these lines. A copy of our telegram on this subject, together with a copy of the reply received from His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa, is attached as Appendix &quot; D.&quot;Negotiations with the Companies Concerned.44. In instituting these negotiations we were careful to emphasise that they were undertaken on the understanding that their object was merely to enable us to formulate recommendations to the Governments concerned, with whom rested the final decision in regard to all the matters involved.45. The negotiations have proved even more protracted than was anticipated as the conditions stipulated by the Conference involved rather delicate negotiations with the Companies concerned, not only as regards their individual interests in the intended Merger, but as regards the ultimate effect on their combined interests. This involved many meetings with the representatives of the Companies, apart from the joint meetings which have been held from time to time. Our expert advisers had also frequent consultations with those representing the special interests of His Majesty&apos;s Governments, the Pacific Cable Board and West Indian System with a view to preparing the necessary statements supporting the value of the Cable and Beam Wireless activities to be taken over by the proposed Merger. A reasonable time had also to be given to the representatives of the Cable and Marconi Companies to examine and satisfy themselves as to the past and probable results of these activities before meeting to discuss and arrange the terms on which they should be acquired.46. It will be appreciated that in these circumstances the conduct of the negotiations was no easy task, and we should like to place on record our appreciation of the work carried out by Sir Otto Niemeyer and Sir William McLintock on our behalf.[17874]
V. Recommendations.47. Having regard to all the factors set out above, we submit the scheme outlined below for consideration by the Governments concerned, as providing the best solution of the problem referred to us.48. The objects of this scheme are (a) to secure, as far as is possible, all the advantages to be derived from unification of direction and operation; (b) at the same time to preserve for the Governments concerned control over any unified undertaking which may be created, so as to safeguard the interests of the public in general and of the Cable and Wireless users in particular; and (c) to secure these desiderata at the minimum of cost to the Governments concerned.49. Before setting out our recommendations in detail, we desire to record that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa has stated that it fully realises the necessity of maintaining adequate means of communication between the various parts of the Empire, and with that object participated in this Conference. It was because the Union of South Africa is in an entirely different position from that of Great Britain and the other Dominions, which possess in some instances financial control and in others financial interest either in cables or in wireless or in both, that its representative reserved his position- (vide Nos. I and V, Appendix &quot; C &quot;). : ,.Nevertheless, the Union Government, while considering it inadvisable to commit itself to any merger until the conditions of the agreement were fully known, lest the Governments control might be jeopardized, expressed its willingness to give the matter most careful consideration after the terms of the agreement had been formulated (vide Appendix &quot; D &quot;).50. We wish also to note that the joint-purse arrangements, between the Eastern Companies and the Indo-European Telegraph Company: and the Indo-European Telegraph Department of the Government of India, referred to in paragraph 21, will not be affected by the acceptance of the recommendations detailed belpw, although the precise terms of these arrangements may possibly require revision. !:51.   Our detailed recommendations are accordingly as follows : Recommendation (i). The Merger Company.The Merger Company to be formied will acquire, as from, the 1st April, 1928, all the Ordinary Shares of the Eastern, Eastern Extension and Western Telegraph Companies, and all the Ordinary and Preference Shares and Debentures (if any) of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company.We consider that, since this merger has been the subject of agreement between the parties concerned and its terms have been publicly announced, it forms the obvious basis for the creation of a company to combine the respective interests of the Cable and. Marconi groups. Bearing in niind that the Cable group has large investment interests and the Marconi group manufacturing and other interests which are not in either case directly concerned with communication services, it has been proposed to and accepted by the parties to the intended merger that there.should be formed an entirely separate Company, on public utility lines, to own all the assets and conduct all the business of the Merger in so far as they relate to communication services. We deal with this important aspect under recommendation (ii) below. ,Recommendation (ii).-The Communications Company.There will also be formed a Communications Company, to which the Cable and Marconi Companies will sell, as at the 1st April, 1928, all their Communica-tion Assets in exchange for shares. The -Communications Company will therefore hold all the Communication Assets of the Cable and Marconi Companies, except in so far as these belong to the Subsidiary Companies in which the Cable and Marconi Companies&apos; holding is less than 100 per cent.
The Communications Company will acquire the holdings of the Cable and Marconi Companies in those Communications Companies in which the Cable and Marconi Companies&apos; holding is less than 100 per cent. The Communications Company will also acquire the Government Cables and hold the lease of the Post Office Beam stations. The capital of the Communications Company not to exceed at its inception  30,000,000.The chief objection to the proposed capitalisation of the Merger Company was the possibility that rates might be maintained at an unduly high level in order that the holders of &quot;all the classes of shares in the amalgamation might receive a return on their investment. By the formation of the Communications Company on the lines indicated above, this objection is overcome, since thereby.an arrangement is made to segregate in one Company the Communications Company what may be termed the purely communications aspect of the undertaking, leaving in the hands of the Merger Company the investments of the Cable Companies and the Marconi interests in non-traffic undertakings and the other activities, such as the manufacture of radio apparatus and the exercise of Wireless patent rights, in which the parties to the Merger Company are interested. Further, the proposed capitalisa-tion of the Communications Company will bear a direct relation to the purely communications assets and operations of the undertaking, and will not be over-loaded by any undesirable or speculative element. This arrangement will enable a scheme to be drawn up for the equitable apportionment of future profits derived solely from communication operations as between the shareholders of the Company and the cable- and wireless-using public. We deal with this point in greater detail below. ,Recommendation (iii). Terms of Transfer of the Governments&apos; Cable and BeamAssets.The Communications Company to take over as from the 1st April, 1928, the Pacific Cable Board&apos;s Cables, the West Indian Cable and Wireless system&amp;m worked by the Pacific Cable Board, the Imperial A atlantic Cables and the lease of the Post Office Beam services (including provision for the transfer to the Company of existing staffs) on terms to be arranged.The Beam services to be leased for 25 years at a rental of (a.) A basic sum of  250,000 per annum..(b.) As from the 1st April, 1931, an addition equivalent to 12 per cent, on any increase in the Company&apos;s profits (from Communications Services) above the standard revenue.   (See Recommendation (v).)(c.) A payment of  60,000 to,be paid in such manner as may be agreed.The Communications Company to undertake to meet the annual service of the. outstanding debt on the Pacific Cable,Beard as on the 1st April, 1928, and to pay in addition a capital sum of  517,000 for the Pacific Cables, together with interest at 5 per cent, as from the 1st April, 1928; to pay  300,000 for the West Indian Cable and  450,000 for the Imperial Cables.. The rental payable by the Communications Company and the service of the Pacific Cable Board debt will be guaranteed by the Merger Company.Recommendation   (iv).-Direction  and  Management of the Undertakingsconcerned.The Board of Directors of the Merger Company, the Communications Com-pany, the Cable and Marconi Companies will be identical: Two of the Directors, one of whom shall be Chairman of the Communications Company, to be persons approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the suggestion of the Cable Companies. . - &quot;. -  .*\- - -If the Boards of the various Companies involved were not identical, there would be a risk of separate, and possibly conflicting, policies being pursued by the different entities in,the undertaking. This would be bound to militate against efficiency; and unity of direction, which is one of the main objects of the scheme, would not in fact be secured.
At the outset the number of Directors will, in consequence of the amalgamation, be large. It has, however, been proposed to and accepted by the Companies, that as and when opportunities offer this number will be reduced to a smaller figure, say twelve, including, of course, the two Directors approved by His Majesty ^Government..Recommendation (y). Revenues of the Communications Company.A standard net revenue of  1,865,000 [exclusive of non-telegraphic invest-ment revenue) from the Communications Company services to be fixed to the purposes of the Company; all net revenue from Communications Service in-excess of that sum to go as to 50 per cent, to the Company, and as to 50 per cent, to reduction of rat&amp;s or such otMer purpose as the Advisory Committee [see recommendation (vi)) may appnwve. If additional capital expenditure is incurred by the Communications Company in relation to traffic, there shall be added to the above initial standard revenue an appropriate charge for interest at stich rate as may later be agreed.It is obviously desirable that as a corollary to handing over to private enterprise the conduct of public services, there should be an effective method for ensuring that the users of this service shall not be exploited for the benefit of the shareholders in the private undertaking. Some check ought, therefore, to be placed on the profits which may be earned by the Communications Company. With this object in view, a standard net revenue, representing approximately 6 per cent, on the capital of that portion of the undertaking which is solely engaged in the conduct of communications is, therefore, fixed as the normal amount which the Company may appropriate without question to its own purposes. Any excess over this amount should obviously be devoted, in part at least, to the benefit of the users of the service. If the whole of this excess were attributed to the users, there would be little incentive to the Company to improve and develop its services beyond the point where the standard net revenue was earned, and stagnation at this point might be expected to result. Such a state of affairs would not inure to the adyantage of either the Company, the users of the service or the public generally. It is for this reason that a proportion of any excess revenue above the standard is allotted to the Company.Recommendation (vi). Control by the Governments concerned.The Communications Company to consult, in regard to questions of policy,, including any alteration of rates, an Advisory Committee, which we suggest should include representatives of the Governments participating in this Con-ference, to whom representatives of other parts of the Empire may be added as required from time to time with the approval of the Governments concerned.No increase of rates prevailing at the date of the formation of the Com-munications Company to be made except tvith the assent of the Advisory Committee.As the undertaking is one which closely concerns the several parts of the Empire it is essential that they should have a voice in the direction of the policy of the undertaking; and having regard to the responsibilities of the Governments concerned, as trustees for the Public, it is essential that they should be in a position to. exercise an additional measure of control over policy to that secured by approval of the nomination of certain members of the Board of the undertaking.The Imperial Advisory Committee should have access to all information in the&apos; hands of the Communications Company which is necessary to enable it to carry out its duties.   Such information would, of course, be treated as strictly confidentialAs has been indicated above, the main concern of the Governments is to secure an efficient and cheap service. For this reason the Imperial Advisory Committee should, we suggest, be given absolute powers in regard to any proposed increase to existing rates, and the allocation of the funds which become available for rate reduction, &amp;c, in accordance with recommendation (v) above.But there are also other questions, such as the institution of new services, the discontinuance of any services which become commercially unprofitable, and the general distribution of traffic between alternative routes.   For example, with regard
is &quot; :to the question last mentioned, it will be desirable that a reasonable proportion of the total cable traffic between Great Britain and Australia and New Zealand should continue to pass over the route by way of Canada, which does not touch foreign territory at any point. It is not possible to prescribe in advance for all such con-contingencies. They can only be judged in the light of the circumstances obtaining at the time. For this reason it should be provided that in all such matters of general policy the Communications Company should consult the Imperial Advisory Com-mittee. Cases may occur in which the interests of the public in regard to cheap communication may conflict with strategical requirements. In such cases the Committee must weigh the relative merits of the two considerations and advise accordingly.We do not attempt to lay down the precise composition of the Committee or to define the status of its members, as we feel that these are matters outside our competence, and more appropriate for determination by the Governments concerned.Recommendation (vii). Additional Safeguards and Conditions.It is to be agreed:  &apos;(a.) That British control of all the Companies must be guaranteed.(b.) That the Governments may assume control of the cable and wirelesssystems in time of war or other national emergency. (e) That the Fighting Services are entitled to build and work cable or .     xoireless stations for their own purposes, but not for commercial purposes.In addition, there are, of course, a number of points of detail which will have to be included in the formal agreement with the Companies concerned, as for example, an undertaking on the part of the Communications Company to submit their accounts, if required, to examination on behalf of the Advisory Committee; an undertaking on the part of both the Merger and Communication Companies not to dispose, or allow any serious diminution in the control, of their communications assets; safeguards against undue preference or excessive payments for apparatus manufactured or patented by the Merger Company; precise terms in regard to the transfer of personnel, &amp;c. Points such as these can only be dealt with fully in a legal document, and need not, therefore, be elaborated further here.Recommendation (viii). Telephone Services.The Post Office in London will reserve the right to conduct the external telephonic services of Great Britain; but will agree with the Company the terms on. which it will have the right to use the Company&apos;s wireless stations or portions thereof for telephonic purposes.52. The above scheme is designed to secure a common basis for the conduct of the Telegraphic Communications of the various parts of the Empire. The full benefits of the scheme can only be secured by whole-hearted co-operation on the part of all the Governments concerned and of the undertakings conducting telegraphic communications throughout the Empire. The establishment or authorisation of services within the Empire, which work in opposition to, or indeed out of harmony with, the above scheme would deprive it of much of its value and would militate against the objects which we have endeavoured to attain. We recommend, therefore, that, if our pro-&quot;posals commend themselves to the Governments of the several parts of the Empire, they should take steps to apply the principles of the scheme, with such modifications in points of detail as may be necessary to meet local conditions, to the overseas telegraphic undertakings operating within their jurisdiction. For example, it will be appreciated that the prospects of harmonious working might be prejudiced, if -any of the undertakings concerned were not under predominant British control.53. After an exhaustive study of all the factors involved and consultation with all the available interests concerned, we feel convinced that the scheme outlined above provides the best solution of what is a problem of the first importance to all parts of the Empire. The telegraph service is not only a matter of common interest, but possibly the link on which, more than any other, the several parts of the Empire
depend for mutual intercourse and mutual understanding. Our recommendations will, we believe, establish this service on a firm foundation, lead to its development, and provide for its administration in a manner well calculated to bring to the communities which it is its function to serve.all the benefits which naturally flow from a rapid, cheap, and efficient system of communications.54. We cannot conclude this Report without expressing our high appreciation of the work of the Secretary to the Conference, Wing-Commander Sir Norman Leslie, Bart., C.B.E., and the Assistant Secretaries, Mr. C.

As at present advised, Conference is of opinion that British Empire cable interests as now constituted are unable to continue in operation on a paying basis in face of unrestricted competition on the part of wireless undertakings. Strategic conclusions confirmed by Committee of Imperial Defence necessitate retention of essential portions of Eastern Cable systems. Conference is endeavouring, therefore, to agree some proposal to [17874] d
put before Governments which will allow Eastern Company and Pacific Cable Board to live and which will not increase rates. In determining this scheme Conference recognises definite economies to be realised through transference to Eastern Company of management and operation of Pacific Cable Board. Immediate savings approximate eighty thousand pounds per annum. Conference recognises importance of reducing expenditure of cable systems to minimum in order to assist reduction of rates. Conference considers time has arrived to ask His Majesty&apos;s Governments in Great Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand whether they would view with favour arrangement whereby Eastern Company would lease Pacific Cable Board system, assuming responsibility for repayment to His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain of outstanding capital advance and deficits, would maintain system and would, in effect, guarantee Board against loss, but Board would retain reserve of about  185,000. Other conditions to be agreed would include assumption by Eastern Company of liability to compensate such staff as not taken over, for which existing&apos;pension fund of approximately  140,000 would not probably suffice. His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain would probably require adequate safeguards for Imperial Cable traffic, or, alternatively, undertaking to lease Imperial Cables.

jy Reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia.Telegram from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. [Received in the Dominions Office, 2nd March, 1928, and repeated in Dominions Office Telegram of 9th March to Canada, No. 46, New Zealand, No. 24.)No. 36.  2nd March.Replying to your telegram of 29th February: Wireless and Cable Conference. My Government notes that the Conference is of the opinion that the British Empire Cable interests as now constituted are unable to continue operations on a paying basis in the face of unrestricted competition on the part of Wireless undertakings. Further, that the strategic conclusions confirmed by the Committee of Imperial Defence necessitate the retention of certain portions of the Eastern Cable system. With these conclusions my Government agrees. With regard to the proposal submitted by the Conference to arrive at solution of existing problems, my Govern-ment, after full consideration, would be prepared to acquiesce in an arrangement for the management and control of the Pacific Cable to be transferred under lease to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company provided that a satisfactory arrangement can be arrived at embodying sufficient and proper safeguards. In this latter, connection the suggestions of the Conference are noted, but would, of course, have to be worked put in greater detail and re-submitted.The advantages in the reduction of expense of running cables are so obvious, and the bringing about of a diminution of operating expenses under the existing circumstances are so vital, that an arrangement of the character outlined would be welcomed by my Government.I must, however, make it clear that my Government in signifying its approval is not prepared to acquiesce in any arrangement, either as part of the above scheme,, or otherwise, whereby reduction of wireless rates would be restricted with a view to preventing a recurrence of the position which existed with the two Cable Companies operating separately.V.

Secret.Your telegram of the 29th February, No. 18 : Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference. Prime Minister states that in view of shortness of time in which reply requested, it has been impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand to give full consideration to proposals at this date. However, it may be generally taken that this Government will be prepared to concur in any arrangement which may be approved by Canada and Australia, but which at the same time is not inequitable to Great Britain.VI. Copies of the foregoing Communications (I to V) were transmitted by the India Office to the Government of India by mail on the 15th March.VII. Summary of foregoing Communications, as Transmitted to His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Union of South Africa and the Irish Free State.(Dominions Office Telegram to the Union of South Africa, No. 19 of %th March, and Dominions Office Secret Despatch to the Irish Free State of 10th March.)(Secret.)His Majesty&apos;s Governments in Great Britain, Canada, Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand were informed in a message from the Conference sent on the 29th February that, in endeavouring to agree some proposal to be put before [17874]       &quot; e
Governments which, would allow Eastern Company and Pacific Cable Board to live and would not increase rates, Conference recognised that definite economies estimated at eighty thousand pounds per annum might be realised through transference to Eastern Company of management and operation of Pacific Cables. Conference therefore asked partner Governments whether, subject to submission of ultimate terms for approval, they would view with favour arrangement for lease of Pacific Cable system to Eastern Company, who should maintain system, in effect guarantee Board against loss, and assume responsibility for repayment to His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain of outstanding capital advance and deficits. Latter Government would also probably require safeguards for Imperial trans-Atlantic Cables. This transfer, if agreed to, to be laid down as condition at outset of any negotiations with Eastern Company.   An answer in five days was requested.His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain replied that they would assent to the lease of the Pacific Cables to the Eastern Company, subject to agreed conditions including a suitable rental (being not less than the annuity now paid to the British Exchequer), and to satisfactory arrangements, either in the form of a concurrent lease or of a guarantee of traffic, being made for the protection of the Imperial Trans-Atlantic Cables, but that they would not regard a failure to come to terms with the Eastern Company as precluding further negotiations being proceeded with.His Majesty&apos;&amp; Government in Canada replied that they would view transference with favour, that lease should run until at least 1950, and that it appeared essential point to lay down these agreed terms at outset of negotiations.His Majesty&apos;s Government in Commonwealth of Australia replied that they would be prepared to acquiesce.His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand replied that time did not admit of full consideration, but that, in general, they would be ready to concur in any arrange-ment approved by Canada and Australia, and not inequitable to Great Britain.Appendix &quot;C.&quot;THE EASTERN-MARCONI MERGER.I. Communication to His Ma.jesty&apos;s Governments in Canada, the Common-wealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and the Irish Pree State, and to the Government of India, as approved by the Conference at its Twentieth Meeting.(Transmitted to Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa in Dominions Office telegram Circular B., No. 17 of Sth March; to the Irish Free State in Dominions Office despatch, Secret (2), of 10th March; to India in India Office telegram of 10th March.)Very Secret.At the meeting held on the 9th March Conference adopted the following resolution : Begins. The Conference is o&apos;f opinion that a solution of the present problem and the adoption of a common policy by the various Governments concerned would be facilitated by a merger between the Eastern Telegraph and Associated Companies and Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph Company, provided satisfactory arrangements are secured to safeguard the interests of Governments and public concerned.The Representative of the Union.of South Africa reserved his position pending communication with his Government.   Ends.Considerations leading to adoption of this resolution are; .(a.) Conference is impressed with the great activity of foreign corporations aiming at securing control of world communications. Consolidation of British cable and wireless interests would, ihtheir opinion, be of supreme value in checking foreign enterprise throughout Empire and ifi safeguarding great British commercial interests throughout the world-
I 21I(b.) In the absence of acceptable safeguards, Eastern Telegraph Company would probably decide that present time is most opportune for going into liquidation, its reserves and realisation on assets being ample to safe-; guard its shareholders against loss.(c.) Governments would be powerless to prevent sale of Eastern Companies&apos; assets, particularly those in foreign territory, to foreign buyers, unless themselves, prepared to acquire companies&apos; system and take over their organisation, which presumably would not be countenanced by Governments.(d.) Negotiations with a view to putting into operation schemes which have engaged attention of Conference would be facilitated if the private interests concerned were merged.(e.)\ Stipulations could be included in any Government licences granted to the merged Company to protect the interests of the public.An essential objective in connection with the assent to the merger would be the transfer of the Pacific cables and Imperial trans-Atlantic cables to the merged Company on terms to be agreed.His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain has no objection in principle to a merger between Eastern Telegraph and Marconi&apos;s Companies. Conference desires to know whether other Governments entertain any objection to a solution being sought on this basis.Conference has requested Representatives to draw attention of their Govern-ments to the essentially, secret nature of this communication.Conference adjourns until the 14th March, when it is hoped replies will be received.       &apos;II. Reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada.Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for External Affairs, Canada, to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, dated 12th March. (Received, Dominions Office, 13th March, 1928.)Very Secret. 12th March. Communication from Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference regarding merger between Eastern Telegraph and Associated Companies and Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph Company, transmitted in your telegram, 9th March, Circular B., No. 17, has been received.His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada has no objection in principle to this merger. They note that, in connexion with assent to merger, transfer of Imperial Transatlantic Cables and Pacific Cables to the merged Company upon terms to be agreed upon would be essential objective. His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada in this connexion wish to recall the statement in the message from the Conference communicated in your Secret telegram of 29th February that transfer of Pacific Cables, if approved, should be laid down as condition at outset of any negotiation with Eastern Telegraph Company. Canadian Government stated in their reply of 3rd March that they concurred in this view, which would equally apply to the merged company.III. Reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia.Paraphrase Telegram from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, dated V&amp;th March.-^(Received, Dominions Office, lUh March, 1928.)Very secret.   No. 43 of 13th March.Resolution of Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference of 9th March transmitted in your telegram of 9th March, Circular B., No. 17,. has received careful consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia. Considerations leading Conference to the adoption of the resolution have deeply impressed them. They appreciate the danger, in the interest of the Empire generally, of the world&apos;s communications falling under the control of foreign corporations and the desirability of British Cable and Wireless interests being &apos; consolidated. They recognise that, in the event of the Eastern Telegraph Company disposing of its assets and going into liquidation, there would be serious danger of [17874] ^ E 2
the former. They also appreciate that, having regard to the large reserves possessed by this Company, there is risk of this course being adopted unless some action to safeguard the position in the future is taken. Taking over of Eastern telegraph system by Governments of the Empire jointly would be means of obviating this danger, but my Government is opposed to adoption of any such course.Having regard to all the circumstances and to great issues involved, the Commonwealth Government offers no objection in principle to solution being sought on the basis of merger between Marconi and the Eastern Telegraph Company. The taking over upon satisfactory terms of the Pacific Cables must, of course, be an essential provision of merger. Also, in any scheme, consideration must, it appears to my Government, be given to the position of the Amalgamated Wireless Company of Australasia, which, under an agreement with the Government, controls beam communication between Britain and Australia. The question whether this arrangement should take the form of the inclusion of the Amalgamated Wireless Company in the merger scheme or should be by means of a working arrangement with that Company is a matter regarding which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia would be prepared to consider any suggestions submitted by the Conference.Should the position of the Amalgamated Wireless Company not be dealt with under the scheme, the inevitable result would be that a situation similar to that which at present confronts us in regard to cables generally would arise in the future in relation to cables to Australia in particular.The Conference resolution refers to safeguarding of the interests of the public and sets out under heading of considerations that any Government licences granted could include stipulations to protect the interests of the public. The Commonwealth Government assume that these words are used in the wider sense of the interests of the public generally and not the interests solely of that portion of the public concerned in the lowest possible rate for telegraph communications.In view of the great and fundamental issues involved and of the report of the Committee of Imperial Defence, which lays stress upon the strategic importance of maintaining cable systems for defence purposes, my Government is. prepared to agree to further consideration being given by the Conference to merger proposals and to acquiesce&quot; &quot;in any satisfactory scheme preserving the cable and wireless interests of the Empire in world communications, while safeguarding in the sense that I have indicated, interests of the public and Governments.IV.-Reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand.Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor-General of New Zealand to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, dated 14*A March.

[Received, Dominions Office, 14*A March, 1928.)(Very Secret.)Eollowing reply to your telegram of 9th March, Circular B., No. 17, is for the information of the Conference and for your information. Reply begins: His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa are opposed definitely to any merger or arrangement of a similar nature involving inclusion of Wireless Telegraph Company of South Africa. South Africa is on a footing entirely different from that of Great Britain and other Dominions who in some instances possess
financial control and, in others, financial interest either in cable or in wireless or in both.In neither system has South Africa any financial interest, and it is dependent for any control on the Wireless Act. In the circumstances such Wireless Act control must not be jeopardized, as would be the case if any merger were agreed to.  Ends.No. 22.  14th March.VI.

Appendix &quot;D.&quot;THE OUTLINES. OF A SCHEME FOR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE EASTERN TELEGRAPH AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES AND MARCONXS WIRELESS TELEGRAPH COMPANY.I. Communication to His Majesty&apos;s Governments in Canada, the Common-wealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and the. Irish Free State, and to the Government of India, as approved by the Conference at its Thirtieth Meeting.(Transmitted to Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, and the. Union of South Africa in Dominions Office telegram, Circular B. No. 41 of 3rd May; to the Irish Free State in Dominions Office Secret despatch of the 3rd May; to India in India Office telegram of 4th May.)Very Secret.Conference has been informed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain that no objection in principle to the Merger of the Eastern and Marconi Companies or to the transfer thereto by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain of their trans-Atlantic and Pacific Cable Assets, and their Beam assets would be raised, subject to the following conditions :-(1.) An Agreement both in regard to principle and terms satisfactory to the Governments represented at the Conference.(2.) Transfer to the Merger by. His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain of their trans-Atlantic and Pacific Cable assets and their Beam stations; transfer of Beam to take form of lease, the terms of which should include a royalty on an agreed basis.(3.) Some satisfactory scheme for controlling rates to be worked out by Imperial .      Wireless Conference.(4.) Approval by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain of the arrange-ments for capitalisation of the Merger Company.(5.) Approval by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain of the personnel of the Board of the Merger Company.(6.) The conduct of wireless telephonic services to be reserved to the Govern-ment, and the Merger to be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain is not prepared to sell or lease any form of communication by means of telephony, and will require as a condition of the lease of the &quot; Beanv&quot; telegraphic services that provision shall be made for the use of the Company&apos;s wireless telegraphic stations or portions thereof by His Majesty&apos;s Government if desired for telephonic purposes on royalty terms.(7.) Adequate and satisfactory safeguards against possible foreign control.Conference recognises that the above decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain, which involves for them a wide departure from their previous policy, is a valuable contribution towards the solution of a difficult Imperial problem on lines which it is hoped will prove generally acceptable to, and will meet with the whole-hearted co-operation of the Governments concerned. This co-operation is essential if full benefits of the scheme are to be secured.&apos; Details of the scheme and precise terms to be secured cannot be submitted without negotiations with the Companies concerned. The Conference, accepting the principles laid down by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain as a basis, is proceeding to institute these negotiations.Absolute secrecy is necessary at this stage to avoid risk of prejudicing the-course of negotiations. The Conference attaches the utmost importance to secrecy during negotiations and until final elaboration of scheme and acceptance by all parties concerned.
v.2, Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1, May 9, 1928.oII. Reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa.Paraphrase Telegram from the Minister of External Affairs, Union of South Africa, to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Dated May 8. (Received, Dominions Office, May 8, 1928.) Very Secret.For the reasons which have previously been stated and which indicated that the position of the Union of South Africa was entirely different from that of Great Britain and the other Dominions, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa feel very strongly that any merging of wireless and cable interests might seriously jeopardise the Government&apos;s control and also prevent the exercise of the discretion of the Government with regard to rates.The Union Government, therefore, do not consider it advisable to commit them-selves to merger until conditions of agreement fully known. Union Government prepared then to give the matter most careful consideration.No. 43.  8th May. ;
