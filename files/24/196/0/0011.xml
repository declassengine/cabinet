IS TEJ1 PROPERTY OP HIS ERITixNfiTC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.SECRE2. GOBY SQ.V.. ..0 A g I g E T.TRANSFER Off UNEMPLOYED MINERS, Memorandum by the Minister of labour.CP.- 211./ 28.The normal procedure of the Employment Exchanges in filling vacancies is to exhaust the local supply of suitable labour before going further afield.     Recently, however, in . order to provide openings for unemployed miners from the distressed areas, the policy has been adopted of endeavouring to place some of them in employment - in small numbers of course - in the more prosperous areas,  even though suitable local applicants might have been found.      So far the &apos;  numbers dealt with have been quite small - averaging between 100 and 150 a week - and can have made little difference in the demand for labour in the areas to which they have been transferred.The arrangements for transferring miners in this way are now being challenged by a question which Mr. Lansbury has put down for next Thursday, the terms of which shew that he is probably aware of what is being done.The arrangements are directly in accordance with the policy recommended by the Industrial Transference Board, and I am fully satisfied that they are on the right lines. It is really quite indefensible that a prosperous area should insist on 100$ employment before a single unemployed man from a mining area can be introduced./This
This being so, I propose that the answer to the question (which will be given by Mr. Betterton, owing to ray absence in Cornwall) should say quite plainly ?;hat we are doing, and should justify it   as the only proper course to t^e in view of the circumstances of the distressed mining areas and the relative prosperity of other parts of the Country.(Intd)   A.S-M.Ministry of.Labour. 3rd July, 1928.
