POCOlflSKT is THE PROPERTY Off his BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;s GOvTOMENT). l^J$SMl* &apos; COPY NO(scutmnd), bill, op state for suotia-nd.lo As stated by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries in his Memorandum CaP. 818(28*-)&apos;, we hare &quot;been unable to agree that this BUI now in the House of Lords should be amended as he suggests.2c My reasons for objecting are that such an amendmentat this stage involves serious risk to the Bill especially on its return to the House of Commons, and that there appears to me to be no sufficient need for any such amendment even if it were modified as suggested at the ord of the ministers MsffiJKto 3o She Bill is a Private MemberJs Bill which was supported in the House of Commons by Members of all parties and by myself as representing the government   The time-table of Its&apos;progress through the House of Commons was as follows:-2nd Reading - 17th February 0Throtigh Scottish Grand Committee - 6th March. Report and 3rd Reading - 28nd Jane.A eerie3 of Government amendments (which had been on the Order Paper for some weeks) were made at the Report Stage0 The Bill has been porsiste:atly opposed by the Meat traders Associations who have tried to get it whittled down &quot;by exceptionsThe opponents, though beaten in the House of Commcrs, would seise any opportunity to wreck the Bill and the proposed amen&amp;a/sr..would enable then to revive their objections on various points; Accordingly the proposed amendment may cause serious trouble and risk to the Billo    If the Bill were wrecked at this sta^o
there would be serious resentment in ail parties. 4,     I fully appreciate the necessity for prompt slaughter in the case of foot-and-mouth disease.     But there is no reason to suppose that if an outbreak occurred in a Slaughterhouse or Knacker!s Yard (to which alone the Bill applies) the services of the licensed slaughtermen who regularly work in the Slaughterhouse could not be hired to carry out the slaughter.      If additional hands were required. I have no doubt that any necessary licences could be speedily issued by the Local Authority or their officials.      In another connection, viz: slaughter for the requirements of Lascars on ships3 I have been assured that sudden emergencies can thus be met in practice.If the question had been raised during the period between 2nd Reading and Report Stage (17th February - 22nd June) I should not have felt the same objection to the addition of a proviso to Clause 1) exempting officers or employees of the Ministry from the necessity of obtaining licences from the Local Authority and allow-ing them to vise a mechanically operated instrument of a typo approved by the Minister.      It does not, however,  appear to me that there is my sufficient need to warrant risk to the Bill by proposing such an amendment at this stage,5.     The Minister apparently intends that Clause 4 of the Bill (which authorised any constable or person authorised in writing by a Local Authority to enter a Slaughterhouse or Knacker &apos;s Yard) should )e made inoperative in any case where slaughter is  necessary owing &apos;0 an otitbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.      I am apprehensive hat a statement in Parliament to this effect will excite the ^itlcism that the Ministry are unwilling to allow any opportunity or inspection of their methods of slaughter.      The answer that he Ministry *s employees and officers can be trusted to observe he requirements as to humane slaughter may not be acceptable ither to the supporters or to the opponents of the Bill-am deeply interested in the question of preventing the spread .
of infection.    But in ray view Clause 4 will not deprive the Ministry of proper and reasonable control.    No responsible person who has power to enter a Slaughterhouse or Knackerfs Yard under Clause 4 would disregard the ordinary precautions directed by the Ministry and only responsible persons are concerned.   Any person who entered would be subject to the Ministry&apos;s regulations.    If either the Police in Scotland or officers of the S.P.G.A. gave any trouble in this respect the matter could be effectively dealt with;    While fully recognising the necessity and difficulty of suppressing disease I consider that Clause 4 will not impair proper control by the Ministry-.. S.        On both the points raised therefore, I am of opinion that there is no substantial need for making an kmend^me,rit which if made at this stage may imperil the Bill.(Signed) JOHN C-gilmour.ish Office, S.W.I.July 10th,  1928.
