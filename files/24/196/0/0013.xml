[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.].  [Printed for the Cabinet.        July 1928.)secret. .,CP. 213(28). vi,--.(Circulated by direction of ilie Secretary of State for India with reference to Memorandum CP. 212(28) circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.)4th July 1928.Letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office in regard to the effect on India&apos;s external relations of the Draft Treaty for the Renunciation of War.P. 3245. &apos; India Office,Sir,  - 27th June 1928.I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to your letter of the 11th June, No. A. 3797/1/45, communicating the text of the Note in which the United States Charge d Affaires w%s informed of the agreement o  the Government of India with the terms of the reply returned by His Majesty&apos;s Government on 19th May last to the invitation of the United States Government to participate in the treaty for the renunciation of war. jI am to say that, when the draft of the British Note of 19th May was under consideration by Lord Birkenhead, the question was raised whether the association of the Government of-India with its terms would debar them from warlike gestures or even warlike actions such as they have had to use in the past in dealing with semi-civilised or backward people on their borders, as, for example, gunboat demonstrations at, or even the bombing of, an Arab port in connection with slavery or some wanton misconduct. The question was also raised whether the reservation in para. 10 of the Note was.intended inter alia to give His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India freedom of action in the event of Russian action endangering the integrity of Afghanistan.2. In regard to these points Lord Birkenhead received an unofficial assurance from the Foreign Office that they were considered to be fully covered by the reservations made in the British Note, and the reply of the Government of India to the invitation of the United States Government to become original parties to the treaty communicated in this Office letter of 4th June 1928 No. E. and 0. 3568/28, was framed on that assumption.3. Lord Birkenhead has since had under further consideration the question of the effect on India&apos;s external relations of acceptance of the proposal of the United States Government, subject to the reservations made in tbe British Note of 19th May. While His Lordship does not wish to- question the adequacy of the safeguards contained in these reservations, he thinks it desirable, with a view to avoiding the possibility of misunderstanding in future, that the nature of the restrictions which would be imposed on the external policy of India vis-d-vis of neighbouring States by the conclusion of the proposed treaty should be more minutely examined, having i regard to the fact that it has from time to time been necessary for the Government of India in the past to contemplate, or even to resort to, armed intervention in certain of these States in the interests of self-defence, the protection of British subjects, or the maintenance of treaty rights.4. In reviewing the position Lord Birkenhead has not thought it necessary to take-into special account India&apos;s relations with Arab rulers, or with Tibet and Nepal, seeing that the obligations of the draft treaty are applicable only as between the signatories and (apart from the fact that a number of the Arab rulers are in exclusive treaty relations with the Government of India and enjoy their protection) it.appears improbable that these.States will be invited, or will desire, to be parties to the proposed treaty for the renunciation of war. It is rathe]&apos; in regard to India&apos;s relations with China, Siam, Persia, Iraq (when it ceases to be under mandate) and Afghanistan that some further examination of the position seems desirable, since it appears possible that these States might desire, if invited, to participate in the treaty.2896      75   7.28
25. Among the grounds on which, armed intervention in a foreign State has been resorted to by the British Government in the past have been :  (I) self-defence against territorial aggression ;(2) protection of the rights, liberties, and interests of British subjects ; (3) maintenance of rights conferred by treaty ;(4) the repelling of aggression by a third Power deemed likely to threaten the security of our own frontiers.Lord Birkenhead presumes that the reservation made in para. 4 of the British Note of 19th May was intended to safeguard our freedom of action in the case of (1) above, bat it is not clear- to what extent, if at all, this reservation could be construed as safeguarding our freedom of action in the case of (2) or of (3). Again, in para. 10&apos; a reservation was made in respect of (4), though it was not stated within what limits the freedom of action there claimed would be exercised. Furthermore, it was suggested in para. 11 that the conditions for the inclusion among the parties of States whose Governments had not yet been universally recognised, or which-were scarcely in a position to ensure the maintenance of good order and security within their territories, might have to be further considered.0, In framing this last suggestion it seems possible that His Majesty&apos;s Government may have had in mind the possibility, referred to at (2) and (3) above, of its becoming necessarv to demand redress by forcible means of a Wrong inflicted on a British subject or the breach of a treaty obligation Avithin a State which might desire to become a party to the proposed treaty, and may have felt that it might in certain circumstances be difficult to bring such action under the strict definition of self-defence.7. Lord Birkenhead presumes that, in contemplating the exclusion of certain States from an invitation to participate in the treaty, His Majesty&apos;s Government would nevertheless regard States which are Members of the League of Nations as ipso facto entitled to participate in the treaty. Thus, China, Siam, Persia, and Iraq at some perhaps not very remote date would be potential parties thereto. . At the same time His Lordship recognises that, in virtue of the obligations assumed under the Covenant of the League, these States would be subject to various means of pressure, other than, that of armed intervention by ourselves, in the event of their being held responsible for a flagrant act of aggression on our. territories, a wrong inflicted on a British subject, or a serious breach of treaty obligations ; while our own obligations as Members of the League would presumably prevent us from having recourse to forcible action against them, except in execution of the policy of the League. For this reason it seems unnecessary to consider the extent to which our acceptance of the proposed treaty would limit our action in the cases above referred to vis-a-vis of China, Persia and Siam. ...8. In regard, however, to Afghanistan, which, although not a Member of the League, is presumably eligible to become a party to the treaty, it would appear to His Lordship that the position of India would be more definitely affected by its entry into force. On account of the conditions prevailing in the tribal belt on the North-West Frontier of India the Government of India, as intimated in their telegram of 18th February 1925 (of which a copy is enclosed) commenting on the Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, saw insuperable difficulty in the way of adopting its machinery for the delay or prevention of hostilities with Afghanistan in the event of tension arising between the two countries.   His Lordship apprehends that circum-stances might arise in which it would be difficult to avoid such a state of tension developing into one of active hostilities, despite the efforts of both sides to keep their disputes within peaceful  limits, and   the  disadvantages of  the position  would of course be greatly aggravated if there were room for doubt as to the will, as well as the power,  of Afghanistan to act in the spirit of the treaty.     Lord Birkenhead, however, feels that it would be politically undesirable for His Majesty&apos;s Government to endeavour to prevent Afghanistan becoming a party to the proposed treaty.   If, therefore, her application to become a party Avere made and accepted, and if the full letter of the treaty were held to apply as between India and Afghanistan  that is to say, if neither the inclusion of Afghanistan among the regions indicated in para. 10 of the Note of the 19th May, nor auy special conditions of admission under para. 11 were held to give India any special freedom of action the Government of India would be obliged to forgo any possibility  of more  fully protecting their
interests (and perhaps averting the risk of actual hostilities) by using armed inter-vention, or the threat of it, as a weapon of policy in the initial stages. But this is a contingency which His Lordship would regard with grave misgiving, and its implications would require to be carefully examined. The treaty would not bring India, at all events, one day nearer to disarmament.9. A- question of a different order arises for consideration in connection with the important reservation made in para. 10 of the British Note of 19th May. His Lordship observes that this reservation might be applicable to any of the countries bordering on India. He has already been given to understand that it is intended to cover aggression by Russia against Afghanistan. He would, however, suggest that opportunity be now taken to consider whether inter alia it is also applicable to Iraq and Koweit, and the parts of China bordering on India, to Persia (and particularly the Persian Gulf, with reference to Lord Lansdowne&apos;s declaration of 1903) and to Siam. Lord Birkenhead understands that, notwithstanding anything in the treaty, the Government of the United States of America would not tolerate the lease to a foreign Power of a port in the neighbourhood of the Panama Canal. Presumably, therefore, a similar attitude on the part of Great Britain would be permissible; but it seems desirable that the radius within which it is permissible should not only be carefully determined but also be publicly declared.Lord Birkenhead would be grateful for the observations of Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain on the various questions raised in this letter and more particularly on the following:  (a) Is the reservation of the rights of self-defence in para. 4 of the British Note of 19th May intended to apply (1) only in respect of aggression on British territory or (2) could it also in any&apos;measure be invoked in respect of wrongs inflicted on British subjects within the limits of a foreign State and flagrant breaches of treaty obligations ?(6) If the application of the reservation is regarded as being restricted to (1) above, is it to be assumed that occasions for armed intervention arising out of (2) are not envisaged in the reservations made in the British note ?(c) Within what area bordering on India is the freedom of action claimed in para. 10 intended to be exercised ?(d) To what countries bordering on India is it contemplated that the reservationin para. 11 might be held to apply ?I have, &amp;c,The Under Secretary of State, L. D. Wakely.Foreign Office.ENCLOSURE.Telegram from V iceroy, Foreign and Political Department, to -Secretary of State forIndia, dated \Stli February 192.$&apos;212 S. Your telegram No. 334. Geneva Protocol. While in full sympathy with its objects, we regard Protocol, in its present form at any rate, as impracticable and dangerous from standpoint of Empire as a whole and of India especially. Papers received make it clear that former aspect has already been adequately presented.   We confine our comments, therefore, strictly to latter.Proposals regarding arbitration, determination of aggressor and armistice may conceivably be workable and effective as between highly organised nations. India, however, has dealings with nations loosely organised and incapable of appreciating or working the complicated machinery for delaying or preventing hostilities. It would clearly handicap India gravely to have to abide strictly hy rigorous obligations under the Protocol which her less civilised antagonists would not, and perhaps could not, fulfil. On the crucial portion of our frontier we have a tribal belt nominally ours, but responsive, especially during periods of tension, to Afghan intrigue, which would make any such arrangements as are contemplated by the Protocol impossible of application to our relations with Afghanistan. Afghan interpretation of an armistice in 1919, when Afghanistan held back its army, yet incited our tribes (potentially more formidable than any Afghan army), throws India&apos;s peculiar position into clear relief. Insidious hostility in this form would hardly be susceptible of proof to satisfaction of a distant Council unversed in our frontier problems. Even if .it were, what control could  a body of men in Geneva exert  on forces in actual
contact somewhere-.-Uv:the neighbourhood of our borders?   In such a conflict, with Afghanistan disregarding the League&apos;s orders, there would he no one to enforce them except India. ,-Under-this part of the Protocol India clearly would have much to risk-.&apos; and nothing to gain.Conclusion is the same as when we examined the question of sanctions. India&apos;s geographical position and possession of a standing army mark her clown as the nation, on which the League,&apos;under the Protocol, would ordinarily call to apply immediate pressure against recalcitrant State in the East. Put Hindu India&apos;s theoretical sympathy with the League of Nations would change to strong resentment if we-attempted to place India&apos;s army under the&apos; Orders of the League, whilst Moslem opinion, already inclined to regard the League as combination of Christian Powers-and potential menace to Islam, might, in circumstances easily conceived, render it politically imprudent and indeed perhaps impossible to comply with a call from the League to use India&apos;s army against a Moslem State. If we turn to the Far East, the-intolerable burden of potential obligations the Protocol would place on India becomes even more apparent. - If Japan were declared the aggressor owing, say, to encroachments on China, foremost, and in effect perhaps alone, among the signatory States on which the Council would call to apply the sanctions under Article 11 would he Great Britain and India owing to their &quot;geographical position and particular situation as regards armaments.&quot; This test case seems to demonstrate finally inapplicability to the East of a Protocol designed primarily for European continent requirements.Eveu though circumstances may be conceived in which it would be possible to-utilise InchVs forces for the settlement of a foreign quarrel, we doubt whether we should be justified in applying Indian, revenues to defray the cost, as is apparently contemplated under the Protocol, more especially as anticipated recovery of cost from the defeated aggressor would be altogether visionary in the case, at any rate, of countries like Persia or Afghanistan.Faced as she is by a loosely organised Afghanistan, and with Russia standing out,. India would clearly not be justified in subscribing to any disarmament proposals.
