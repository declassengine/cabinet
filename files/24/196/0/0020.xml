[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1928. -CONFIDENTIAL.CP- 220 (28).TREATY FOR THE RENUNCIATION OF WAR..28(Circulated to Cabinet by Direction of Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.)Note by the Secretary of state circulate to my colleagues a report by Sir Cecil Hurst on his conversations in Berlin with the legal advisers of the French and German Foreign Offices.A. C.Sir C. Hurst to Sir Austen Chamberlain.Sir, Foreign Office, July 9, 1928.I HAVE the honour to report that the conversations in which you instructed me to take part at Berlin with M. Fromageot and Dr. Gaus about the proposed Peace Pact took place on the 6th and 7th July, and showed no appreciable divergence of view between us. A note was prepared embodying the views at which we all arrived (Enclosure 1). It was interesting to find that each of us had come to. the conclusion before the conversations began that it -is not now feasible to obtain any alteration of the text of the proposed Peace Pact, and that in each country the interest which the proposed Pact has evoked renders it impracticable for the Government to reject it. What is now necessary, therefore, is for Governments to find the interpretation of the text most consistent with their interests and to place that interpretation on record as their understanding of its terms and as the basis on which they become a party to it.2. Starting from the assumption that no modification of the text can be obtained, the first question was how to ensure that the acceptance of the Pact should not interfere with the fulfilment of the duties imposed on Members of the League of Nations by article 16 of the Covenant. Reflection convinced us that the provision in the preamble of the draft Pact that signatory Powers which should hereafter seek to promote their national interests by resort to war should be denied the benefits of the treaty was not adequate to safeguard the obligation of the Members of the League under article 16. We do not feel that this provision can mean that a. signatory which goes to war with any State, whether a party or not to the Pact, is to lose the benefit of the treaty, and unless it bears this meaning the statement in the preamble is not sufficient to protect Members of the League as regards article 16. The only way to reconcile the Peace Pact with article 16 of the Covenant is to-maintain that article 1 of the Pact does not preclude action which is taken under article 16 of the Covenant against a Member of the League which has resorted to war in violation of its terms.3. The phrase used in article 1 is that the signatories &quot; renounce it (war or recourse to war) as an instrument of national policy.&quot; The meaning of this phrase is not easy to define, and perhaps it may be well to avoid any attempt at definition, but the idea seems to be to prevent one State forcing upon another a policy by letting it be understood that in the absence of acquiescence war may ensue; in short, that one State is not to get its own way by bullying. As the common note (Enclosure 1) says, it is &quot; la guerre entamee pour favoriser ses propres interets nationaux &quot; that is renounced. If this is the meaning of the phrase, it would not exclude participation \ by one State in a general movement for enforcing peace.4512   [17926] . ,
.4. It is a misfortune, that Mr. Kellogg in. the passage in his speech of the 28th April, seems: to have appreciated so little the nature of the obligations accepted by, members of the League, as it makes it difficult to pass over in silence the extract which is quoted in the American note of the 23rd June. The fact that the Covenant only authorises war in certain circumstances and does not positively require it, is not sufficient to reconcile it with the proposed Peace Pact. Furthermore, the liberty which members of the League enjoy under article 15 (6), (7) and (8), to resort to war individually in certain cases, may well be restricted considerably by the Peace Pact, even if article 16.is unaffected, as the object with which under article 15 (6), (7) or (8.) war were resorted to might be &quot; pour favoriser ses propres interets nationaux,&quot; and, if so, it would not be permissible under the new Peace Pact.5. The interpretation of the phrase &apos;:&apos; renounce war as an instrument of national policy &apos;&apos; given in paragraph 3 has an important bearing on the position of Great Britain and Italy as the guaranteeing Powers under the Treaty of Locarno. A case where the Locarno guarantees come into play because there has been a resort to war by one of the Powers primarily concerned presents no difficulty; in that case the pro-vision in the preamble is sufficient to release the parties from their obligations to the Power which has broken the pact. The Locarno guarantees may, however, come into play where a resort to war has not actually been consummated, and if the pro-vision in the preamble were strictly interpreted it would not cover a case where Great Britain was forced to move because Germany was committing a flagrant violation of articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles by the massing of troops in the Hhineland. The distinction may not be of great importance, but the case cannot be put higher than this. Great Britain is only forced to move under article 4 (3) of Locarno if she is convinced that Germany&apos;s action constitutes an unprovoked act of aggression, and if it constitutes an unprovoked act of aggression it must be the prelude to an act of war, and a case where war was about to be used as an instrument of national policy. There is a gap, even if it be a slight one, between such action on the part of Germany and an actual recourse to war. The interpretation of article 1 of the Peace P^ot given in paragraph 3 above is, therefore,, helpful to Great Britain and Italy as the guaranteeing Powers under the Treaty of Locarno. To France and Belgium it is of less importance, as the flagrant violation of the demilitarised zone would be aimed at them, and action would in their case be legitimate as a measure of self-defence.6. As regards the maintenance of the special position which Great Britain has been obliged to assume in certain areas, notably Egypt, I ascertained that M. Fromageot and Dr. Gaus considered that objection neither could, nor would, be taken by their Governments if His Majesty&apos;s Government intimated that they do not regard the terms of the Peace Pact as excluding their right to maintain and enforce the policy which they have declared in regard to such areas.      ...7. The only other point.;on which your note of the 19th May laid stress was that it must be made clear that if one party to. the/pact violated its terms, the other parties were liberated from its observance towards that State. This point is sufficiently safeguarded by the clause now introduced into the preamble that any party which shall hereafter seek to promote its national interests by resort to war shall be denied the benefits furnished by the treaty. &apos;     &apos; -8. The conclusion is that the points on which stress was laid in the note of the 19th May are adequately covered, and His Majesty&apos;s Government may safely accept the draft text as now proposed by the United States Government.9. The obligations of members of the League under the Covenant (particularly article 16) and of the parties to the Locarno. Treaties being safeguarded, M. Fromageot, Dr. Gaus and I agreed that there is ho need for the special protocols which the French Government proposed should be signed by the parties to these instruments simultaneously with the signature of the Peace Pact.10. The note which was prepared at the end of. our conversations at Berlin (Enclosure 1) was intended to indicate the line with which we felt that the replies made by the various Governments must not be inconsistent. It was not intended to be the outline of the answer to be made by the three Governments. These replies must necessarily differ considerably from each other. It is, however, important that the understandings on which each Government accepts the proposed Peace Pact should be set out in its reply in order that they may be known to all the Governments concerned. The phraseology of the Peace Pact is so vague that, Unless the position is clarified in the replies sent by each Government to the United States, each Government may be putting different interpretations ;on -the^-text,,and great
saconfusion may arise: - Furthermore, each of the replies to the United: States -should be communicated to each of the other Governments which is invited to.be &apos;a party to the pact, as the understandings set out in these notes constitute the conditions in which the contract is concluded, not only with the United States, but with each of the other parties to the pact,- 11. The German Cabinet have, the answer to be made by the German Goverh-ment to the United States proposal under consideration to-day, and to-morrow the subject is coming before the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Reichstag. Whether these bodies will have before them the actual text of the German reply or not, the lines which it is to follow will be settled, and the note itself is likely to be despatched before the end of this week. The answer is likely to be quite short in view of the fact that the previous German note indicated satisfaction with the original terms proposed by the American Government, and the changes which have been made do not modify the situation so far as the German Government is concerned. The French and British answers must necessarily be somewhat longer, but I imagine that the French Government will also now try and get in its reply to the iimerican Govern-ment without delay. I warned my colleagues at Berlin that the British answer would take longer by reason of the necessity of consulting the Dominion Governments.12. If M. Fromageot gets into touch with M. Pilotti, as he has been instructed to do, I told him that, in my opinion, it would be desirable that he should give M. Pilotti information as to the conversations at Berlin, and should also give him a copy of the common note (Enclosure 1). It is a question whether it would not be wise to impart the same information to Mr. Saburi at the Japanese Embassy in London.13. Great assistance was rendered to me throughout my visit to Berlin by the excellent arrangements which had been made for me by the British Embassy there and by the ready help which both Mr. Nicolson and Mr. Yencken gave me in every way.I have, &amp;c.CECIL J. B. HURST.Enclosure 1.Memorandum on the Subject of the Kellogg Draft Treaty. (Translation.)JUDGING from the information received from several sources, it seems now useless to propose to the Government of the United States any modification of the latest draft treaty annexed to Mr. Kellogg&apos;s letter of the 23rd June, 1928. The preamble and the articles of the treaty can only be either accepted or rejected as they stand.The draft having been accepted in principle by all the Governments consulted, the only question that remains is to see whether, in the light of the document as set forth and explained in the covering letter, explanations or reservations are necessary in order to determine its exact scope.In this connexion the following observations may be made : According to the preamble the intention of the contracting parties, as expressly declared, is that a party which has contravened the treaty cannot avail itself of the treaty vis-a-vis its fellow signatories, who are free to act against the treaty breaker.It is therefore clear that article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations is in no way circumscribed in its application to a signatory of the Kellogg Treaty which resorts to war against another signatory. If, on the other hand, the signatory resorts to war against a non-signatory, action by the other co-signatories is also in no way impeded but for other reasons. In fact, what is renounced under the preamble and under article 1 is war as an instrument of national policy, war entered upon to promote one&apos;s own national interests. Now, intervention under article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations is not a war of this character; it is directed against a Power which is disturbing the peace; it takes place in the common interest and not to promote individual interests.Consequently, if the Kellogg Treaty, by forbidding resort to war between the signatories, prevented an act permissible under article 15, paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, this act would, it will be observed, only be forbidden if it proceeded from some selfish motive, and would not be interfered with if it constituted an act of legitimate defence.
The greater the number of signatories to the Kellogg Treaty the smaller will be the chance of war taking place without each party recovering its liberty of action in respect of the party which has broken its engagements.The invitation addressed by the United States to the Powers signatory of the agreements of Locarno, and the right to accede, freely given to other Powers, appear to, be sufficient to put an end to the fears which may have been felt at the start. As regards articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles and articles 2 and 4 of the Rhineland Treaty of Locarno in particular, the obligations of the latter treaty come into play supposing there were to be a flagrant violation by Germany of the said articles 42 and 43, constituting an unprovoked act of aggression, either by the crossing of the frontier, the commencement of hostilities or the assembly of armed forces in the demilitarised zone. In the two former cases there is a resort to war; the parties are liberated from their obligations to the Kellogg Treaty; there are no difficulties. In the third case the assembly of troops constitutes an unprovoked act of aggression; it can only be the first step in a resort to war and constitutes a case of resort to war as an instrument of national policy. Germany would thereby be engaged in committing a violation of the Kellogg Treaty, and would by this very fact liberate the other signatories from their engagements towards her. Hence the inter-vention of the nations which have given their guarantee would not have a personal object, i.e., would not be an act forbidden by article 1 of the Kellogg Treaty.In short, the American proposal must be interpreted as follows:-(1.) Liberty of action against all who break the treaty.(2.) Absolute right of legitimate self-defence.(3.) Renunciation of war for selfish and personal interests.It will be necessary to make it clear that it is on these conditions and subject to this interpretation that the treaty will be concluded. Such is the conclusion to be drawn from the covering letter of the 23rd June in so far as the United States is concerned.     y-As regards the other interested Governments, the procedure which would seem best adapted to their respective positions and least likely to provoke a-difference of opinion with the United States would seem to be the employment of the American method. The letter of the 23rd June calls for an answer. This answer might take note of the American observations and of the interpretation thus given by the United States to the proposed treaty; it would emphasise that it is in the same spirit and with the same intentions that the treaty will be signed. A copy of the answers thus addressed to the United States Government will have to be sent officially to each of the Governments invited to sign the Kellogg Treaty.6
