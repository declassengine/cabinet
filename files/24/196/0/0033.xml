COPY Ho.... ..gc 253  (28).- CABINET.TEE XEtiE OP MAN (CUSTOMS) 3.9B8.Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.This la an annual Bill confirming the Customs Resolutions of the Mans legislature and requires very.little explanation.     The Isle of Man has a separate financial existence, levying its own taxes and defraying its own expenditure.     In particular, it is completely free aB to Customs and Excise duties, subject to confirmation by the Imperial Parliament.     It would be xmprecedented for Parliament to alter them.The effect of the Resolutions confirmed by this Bill is substantially to impose the same Customs tariff as in this country.     The duties on Beer and Spirits remain, as at present, slightly below Imperial rates;    there are no island duties on sugar, table waters, dried fruits, and wrapping paper;    the duties on all ether articles area at Imperial rates as modified by our own Finance Bill of this year.The Bill, which occupies very little Parliamentary time, and is practically formal, must be passed before the adjourn-ment, because the Resolutions of the Manx legislature, which were passed in June are only operative for six months.   Authority ie accordingly-requested to introduce the Bill arid proceed with a. it at once.(Intd.)     A.M.S.TREASURY CHAMBERS. 13th July 1928.
