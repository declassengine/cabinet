MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.When the cabinet at their last meeting discussed the question whether protection should be afforded to British trawlers on the Murman   Coast, It was generally agreed that, unless effective armed escorts with orders to protect the boats outside the three-mile limit could be sent, the only practicable alternative would be to repeat our previous warning to the trawlers and to do our best to prevent them from going.In order that the Cabinet may be able to decide this matter, they should be aware that in the year 1922 we did send warships to protect our trawlers, and, we continued to do so until the Russians agreed not to molest our vessels outside the three-mile limit and to pay compensation In respect   of those which they had molested.     It   Is the established practice recognised by various fishery conventions for each country to maintain armed patrols for the policing of their fisheries, and In view of these precedents, there seems no reasonable cause for the Russians to take exception to the presence of a British patrol vessel outside the three-mile limit on the Murman Coast,     The Russians themselves have recently agreed to the sending of armed German patrol vessels to the Murman   Coast waters.From
A i Qj*tom. the economic point of view, although it is true that during last season there was no diminution of the quantity of fish landed by our trawlers from Northern waters and the same is quite likely to be the case in future seasons, it is an undoubted advantage to have two alternative regions from which supplies may be drawn, particularly in the winter months.     There are times when, owing to weather conditions, there   Is a partial failure of s\xpplies from Iceland and at those times catches from the Murman coast are a valuable addition to the markets and command very high prices.     The fishing industry, with good reason, regard it as a grave injustice that, as occurred more than once last year, German vessels should be in a position to take advantage of those occasions by bringing In and selling at high prices fish which British vessels are precluded from catching.In deciding between the two alternative courses open, it cannot be assumed that, from the point of view of risk of disturbance of the position with Russia, a decision against providing protection would turn out to be the safer. The material factor for consideration is that there is no power to prevent vessels from going to Russian waters. Last year the industry deferred to the wishes of the Government but they did so resentfully and towards the end of the season It required all the efforts of the leaders of the industry to keep some of its members from breaking away.     It Is by no means certain that it will be bpssible to restrain them for another season and If any vessels go there they will go without any control of any sort and it may well be that some foolhardy skipper will give the Russians a pretext for arresting him and seising his vessel, and lifthat
that -neve to occur a situation might arise in this country which would necessitate the taking of steps prejudicial to our relations with Russia,If It Is decided to afford protection there wotild be no difficulty In Imposing upon the trawlers conditions such as the carrying of wireless, reporting of movements, making of rendezvous and keeping In touch with the protecting vessels, and the avoidance of certain areas, which may be considered necessary In order to facilitate protective action.It is quite possible that the protective force will not have to be maintained for long as the mere sending of it may have the effect of eliciting from the Russians some announcement of their intentions which will make Its withdrawal possible.     If the Russians decide to treat our sending an armed force as provocative, their obvious first step is to make some public protest, and to render any such protest plausible it must necessarily be accompanied by a disclaimer of any aggressive intention,     An announcement In this sense by the Russian Government might be of advantage in enabling us to re-establish our right to fish outside the three-mile limit.All things considered, I am of opinion that unless for reasons of foreign policy there Is insuperable objection to such a course, we should give the necessary protection to our trawlers.If it is decided to furnish armed protection, it might be an advantage to allow this information to reach the Russian Government,     This might have the effect of eliciting from them a declaration which would make It unnecessary to send protecting vessels,W.G,stry of Agriculture and Fisheries--23rd July, 1928*
