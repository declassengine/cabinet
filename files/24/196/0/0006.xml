Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour.1.     I have received the attached Report from the Industrial Transference Board, dealing with the problem of the transference of men (mainly miners) from the depressed areas. Sir Warren Fisher and his colleagues were appointed to study the problem with a view to day to day action by  he Departments concerned, rather than to formulate recommendations in the manner customary with Committees.     The present Report accordingly indicates the action - by. way of extended training arrangements, increased t/ravelling facilities, &amp;c. - that has been taken since the Board were appointed in January.      At the same time the Board advise action in certain important directions.2.     I hope that it will be possible for the Departments concerned to take the action advised without reference to the Cabinet;    but having regard to the human needs of the situation and to the great use to which the Opposition will put that situation,.! sincerely trust that my colleagues will read the Report itself.3.      There have been many Questions in the House of Commons, asking when the Board&quot; s Report will be published, and I propose therefore to authorise publication at the end of next week.The Board1 s Findings. 4.     The Board regard the continuing existence of a surplus,... concentrated mainly in a few areas, of upwards of 200,000 workers in the heavy industries and unlikely to find employment/in
in those industries and areas, as a fact which must be accepted and faced.     The idea of a passing depression must be abandoned, particularly by the people in the areas.     The Board reject as unsound a revival of a policy of &quot;tide-over&quot; by means of temporary relief works in the areas.     They propose Ao- effect ii new orientation of the Government1 s unemployment policy, to break up the concentration of unemployment in areas such as South Wales and Durham by the transfer of as many, workers as possible to areas where prospects of isBemployment are more hopeful.5.     They do not boggle at the fact that complete absorption of the surplus in the immediate future cannot be hoped for, and that a transfer policy will mean to some extent a re-distribution of unemployment.     They regard this as on balance a gain.6.     They argue that other. Industries can absorb a considerable number of these men without prejudice to their own personnel, if they make up their minds to do so, and they urge that, on grounds of general industrial polioy,  it would be right for the other industries to make such contribution.     They look for a remedy to the cumulative effect of a large number of small offers of help rather xhan to any spectacular scheme.     They reject an attempted intervention of the State to create employment;    such employment, in their view, would be artificial and temporary and no substitute for the employment created by the ordinary development of industry,7.     The first function of the State Is to ensure free play for the forces making for transfer, and the Board suggest a number of ways in which the State can help, notably by encouraging the fuller use of the Employment Exchange machinery and by training for the younger men.      They do not advocate ordinary land/settlement
so3.settlement in this country - which they feel is expensive having regard to numbers absorbed - but they recommenflL an extension of forest holdings (formed in connection with the afforestation programme) for the older men with families. 8.     They attach great importance to an extension of overseas migration.     They regard the experionce of the working of the Empire Settlement Act since 19.22 and the attitude of the Dominions Governments as particularly disappointing, and they make a number of suggestions for increasing migration under the Act,9,     They look, however, to normal migration outside the Act for the greatest contribution to movement from this country. To obtain this, passage rates must be drastically reduced, 10.   At the same time they indicate emphatically that, unless the formalities (illustrated in the Appendices) to be over-come by a British worker wishing to go to the Dominions are reduced, the lowering of the passage rates, by itself, will be of little use as these formalities indicate a lack of welcome by the Dominions.Action to be taken. 11.    So far as this country is concerned, the Board have made a number of suggestions for encouraging transfer.    Most of these have already been accepted and action on them has been taken, or is about to be taken.     There is one substantial suggestion to which effect has not yet been given, viz. the extension of forest holdings.      For the older and married men, whose rapid transfer with their families to other employment in other areas is extraordinarily difficult, the Board recommend that immediate steps be taken to provide at least 1,000 holdings for families from the depressed areas within/the
the next three years.     Any land settlement scheme must involve expenditure hut forest holdings are by far the cheapest form.    They afford a safe and permanent livelihood for a man and his family.      Prom a political point of view it is most important that we should accept this suggestion. It is a small contribution but a very attractive one, and I think its acceptance by the Government would be regarded by the public as an earnest of the Government&apos; s intention to do something for a very refractory part of the problem. IS.    As regards overseas settlement, I do not propose here to deal with the Board1 s suggestions and comments, but it is clear that the public will expect the Government to give serious consideration to the 3oardTs findings and to take some prompt action.13.   The Board have tried to bring home the meaning of the present situation and they look to the whole community, and particularly to the industrial community, for help in dealing with the problem.     The need for active help can only be brought home by a strong appeal, and I hope therefore that the Government will endorse the Board1s findings and will publicly press the appeal of the Board to employers generally each to offer and to give employment to men from the depressed areas.     The Press are ready to back the appeal. 14.    In considering the policy to be adopted in relation to the transfer of miners it is important to bear in mind the consequences of not effecting transfer.     Apart from the political difficulties, it may be taken that the cost of maintaining in idleness 100,000 men, with average dependants, could not well be less than  6,000,000 per annum - for an unknown number of years.(Intd.)

INDUSTRIAL  TRANSFERENCE  BOARD.APPOINTMENT.Minute by the Minister of Labour, dated 6th January, 1928.In pursuance of the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government, I hereby appointSir Warren Fisher, G.C.B., G.C.V.O., Sir John Cadman, K.C.M;G., D.Sc, Sir David Shackleton, K.C.B., J.P.,to be a Board for the purpose of facilitating the transfer of worker and in particular of miners, for whom opportunities of employment in their own district or occupation are no longer available.
REPORT.To the Eight Honourable Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland, Bart., M.P. Sib,1. We were appointed by your Minute of 6th January, 1928, &quot; for the purpose of facilitating the transfer of workers, and in particular of miners, for whom opportunities of employment in their own district or occupation are no longer available.&quot;I. INTRODUCTORY.2. The unemployment situation which we have had to consider has not arisen suddenly nor is it peculiar to this country. There was unemployment before the war, though exact comparison with post-war experience is not possible owing to the absence of full statistics for the earlier period. In 1907-8 unemployment in some of the heavy industries reached figures comparable with those with which we are now familiar, and was experienced in most trades. But it was more evenly distributed, its period of intensity was relatively short and recovery from it was general. Ajfter the war there was a trade &quot; boom,&quot; but in 1921 there succeeded an intense industrial depression affecting all industries, at first, and continuing, with fluctuations, in several important industries up to the present time. The figures of unemployed persons on the records of the Ministry of Labour have varied between 2,558,000 in May, 1921, and 978,000 in May, 1927.3. The present situation differs in many important particulars from previous &quot; slumps.&quot;   On the one hand, there is active pro-gress among a large range of non-basic industries, even although trading conditions for these are difficult.   Moreover, development in industry is tending to spread more and more widely over the country as corrlmunications improve and electric power comes into greater use.   On the other hand, employment in some of the basic industries tends to become less and less regular.    None the less, I these are the industries which must continue to play a dominant i part in our economic life.    They are essential to our economic I stability.   But we are not entitled to expect them to play as im-portant a part in affording opportunities for heavy manual labour [in the future as they have played in the past.4. It is important to remember these parallel tendencies, for Ian appreciation of them is fundamental to an understanding both2224A 2
of the problem and of our conclusions. It would indeed be a grave outlook for the industrial future of this country if no com-compensating advance could be discerned to offset the economic diffi-culties of some of the big industries. And that this compensation is a reality may be seen from numerous pieces of evidence, such as the general steadiness of revenue, the increase in the savings of. small investors and other financial returns. We select as particularly relevant to the consideration of our problem and as helping to correct a too pessimistic generalisation about the extent of unemployment, the figures published in the Ministry of Labour Gazette in February, 1928, showing that over a period of 2J- years from October, 1923, to April, 1926 years that were by no means free from serious hindrance to industry, both internally and ex-ternally out of 11J million workpeople insured under the TJn-employment Insurance Acts, nearly 8 million drew no unemploy-msnt benefit at all, and of the remaining 3J million, the benefit drawn by 2J millon in no single case exceeded 100 days in all. These figures indicate how regular employment was for the majority of workpeople, and that continuous unemployment was restricted to a comparatively small proportion of the industrial population.5. But in sketching in this background of the employment market, we do not wish to put into false perspective the fore-ground, that although successive Governments and Parliaments, from the years 1921 to 1927, have taken a number of remedial measures, there are at present over 1,100,000 persons recorded as unemployed on the Ministry of Labour registers. These figures are themselves sufficient to dispel any illusion that the problem is of small dimensions or is amenable to solution by any single remedy or universal panacea.6. The material already in the possession of the various Govern-ment Departments has provided a convenient starting-point fur a survey of the: problem and for a consideration of possible remedies. In particular the Ministry of Labour and the Oversea Settlement Department of the Dominions Office have afforded it specially useful help. In the course of a wide range of investiga tioh and. consultation we have visited South Wales, the Nort East Coast and Scotland, and have met there representatives coalowners and workers and of other local industries; we hav inspected employment exchanges, juvenile unemployment centre and training centres for young men and have endeavoured to foil) some idea of the human aspect of the task which has been se for us.7. We were not appointed to supersede existing Departments! agencies, nor were we given executive power or responsibilil
ourselves to effect transfers. We were appointed in order to advise how best to accelerate and intensify the process of transfer of labour already going on through individual initiative, through the machinery of the employment exchanges, the Govern-rnent training centres for unemployed adults (both for home and overseas), the juvenile unemployment centres and the facilities provided for transfer overseas both under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, and by ordinary migration. We have therefore studied closely the working of these various agencies and have already made a number of suggestions which have been adopted. Instances of these are the opening of new training centres for young men in this country at Bristol and Dudley, extensions at similar training centres already established, an extension of the scheme of juvenile unemployment centres in the mining areas, extensions in the training centres for migration overseas at Brandon and Claydon, in East Anglia, and the provision of additional facilities to assist the movement of unemployed persons, particularly of married men, to areas of new employment in this country.8. We have accepted as a fact the existence of a problem of surplus labour in certain industries, requiring to be dealt with by transfer. We have therefore regarded as our immediate business all measures which would in any way assist the transfer of workers either in this country or overseas, concerning ourselves largely with the agencies and the machinery through which such transfers can be carried out and the removal of hindrances to transfer. We have not excluded from our survey the possible creation, by direct intervention in the employment market, of opportunities for employment through transfer. At the same time we have felt bound to have regard to the settled financial policy of the country and to follow the general lines of this policy in reviewing any of the more ambitious schemes, involving heavy outlay of money, which have been brought to our notice.9. Acting upon this view, we have not felt it within our province to examine, for example, such matters as the reorganisation of the coal and iron and steel trades by amalgamation and grouping, or the possibilities of immediately increasing the employing capacity of the iron and, steel and coal trades (and so reducing the size of the &quot; surplus &quot;) through such aids as a general subsidy to those trades or a tariff on imported steel or a bounty on export coal. Similarly we have not examined the question of the reversal of the present legislation on the permissible hours of employment in the coal industry. We are under no illusions about the necessity for a reorganisation from within of the heavy industries ; it is beginning already and will continue. But it seems clear that in its first phases at any rate reorganisation means concentration of production in the most economic units,
and unless this leads to an immediate and substantial expansion of markets through lower prices, a contraction and not an increase of personnel is involved. As for the other proposals mentioned above for meeting the troubles of the heavy industries, probably involving contentious legislation, they are still in the region of debate and controversy, and we do not consider that it would be of practical value for us to attempt to pronounce upon them.10. Likewise, we have not felt it necessary to examine the sug-gestion that, as industry generally (with certain exceptions) is not expanding sufficiently to absorb the surplus labour as fast as is desirable, a change in monetary policy by way of inflation should be considered as a means of stimulating employment.   Nor have we examined certain related suggestions which have been put for-ward, such as the raising of a large development loan or the flood-ing  of  the  money market with  cheap  credit  provided   under I Government guarantee by means of a revived and extended scheme of Trade Facilities loans for industry generally.   If a policy were to be adopted of artificially stimulating industrial activity generally with the object of absorbing surplus labour from the heavy indus-tries, the scale on which the economic intervention by the State j would have to take place would be unparalleled in any other age or country.   Apart, therefore, from the doubt that exists as to theI physical possibility of successful achievement on such lines, andl the far-reaching reactions upon the economic and industrial structure-ture of the country resulting from such intervention in a sphere I where failure would mean, at the least, a disastrous setback, we I have felt that the implications of such schemes in their wider I form clearly place them outside our province.   We are concernedl with the possibilities of a rapid transfer of workpeople from the! depressed areas.   Projects, therefore, which would certainly aronsel prolonged controversy before acceptance even if they were to bel accepted cannot have any immediate and practical value for us.fII.-THE SURPLUS. The Extent of the Surplus.11. In considering the problem, we have concentrated attention primarily on the coal-mining industry where unemployment presents special features which make its incidence, generally spealtl ing, a more serious social problem than in other industries which unemployment is nevertheless severe. At the same timfl we have not overlooked the existence of a considerable volume ol unemployed labour in other heavy industries at the present time! or the possibility that schemes of re-organisation may reveal thl existence of surplus personnel in other industries.
12. Various estimates of the extent of the permanent surplus in the coal-mining industry have been put forward ranging from under 100,000 to over 200,000. The main factors which impress us are :-(1) The present volume of unemployment in the industry and the persistence of this unemployment over a fairly long period with comparatively small fluctuations, as shown by the number of insured persons unemployed at various dates from January, 1927, to date : -	Wholly Unemployed.	Temporarily Stopped.*	Total,January, 1927        ......	146,740	53,868	200,608July, 1927......	132,523	125,743	258.266December, 1927      ......	142,156	65,100	207,256January, 1928        ......	138,589	72,645	211,234Fcbruary,1928       ......	144,507	70,993	215,500March, 1928	148,066	52,009	200,075April, 1928  .........	159,128	49,295	208,213May, 1928    ......	161,300	84,290	245,590Persons with a prospect of resuming work within six weeks, mainly consisting of those who work less than a full week.It will be noted that high figures of unemployment have persisted during a season which is normally a time of large demand.(2) The extent of short-time working in the industry which is much greater than the figures recorded by the Ministry of Labour I of persons &quot; temporarily stopped &quot; would indicate.   Thus, accord-I ing to returns furnished to the Mines Department, on the average I about 450,000 persons have worked less than the full normal number of shifts in each week since the beginning of this year on account of loss of trade or transport difficulties.   Of these, about 235,000 lost one day only; 135,000 two days; and 80,000 more than two days, the total time lost per week from these causes being-Ion the average .81 of a day, equivalent to the full time working of lover 100,000 men.   It is true that short-time working is to some j extent a normal feature of the coal mining industry, but the per-Jsistence of such high figures in the early months of the year (a time ordinarily of high demand) indicates the existence of a more I numerous labour force than is required to produce the present [output and of a considerable reserve of labour power which can be J drawn upon to increase output if necessary, without recourse to the (engagement of new personnel,.(3) The apparently static or even contracting demand for British Coal, due in part at least to external conditions over which this2221A i
country has no control. The effective demand for the time being seems to range around 250 million tons a year. The volume of output necessary to meet this demand is now being obtained with an employed personnel of under 950,000, doing the full-time work of about 850,000. The insured personnel of the industry in July, &quot;1927, was 1,164,380.(4) The movement towards concentration of production, improved methods of working and organised marketing. In the Yorkshire, East Lancashire and Midland coalfields, in South Wales, and in Scotland, schemes of organised regulation of production and organised marketing are already in operation or under consideration. If these schemes are successful in their objects, they will lead eventually to a concentration of production in the best equipped and most economic pits, and probably to the closing of others. Employment may then become more regular, but for a smaller personnel. There are already signs of the effect of this policy of concentration in the additional numbers becoming wholly un-employed in certain areas. Further, a steady improvement in mechanical production, leading to a higher rate of output per man-shift, has been in progress for some time. These tendencies may in the long run be in the interests of the industry, but their imme-diate effect is to intensify the problem of unemployment.13. Prophecies about the future of any great industry such as the coal industry, dependent upon a world demand for its prosperity, are always liable to be falsified by the emergence of unforeseen factors, but upon a consideration of the present employment situa-tion in the industry and the tendencies now at work, our conclusion is that it would be unwise if, on the basis of the information in the possession of the Ministry of Labour and the Mines Depart-ment, any figure below 200,000 were taken as the permanent surplus in the industry. And by &quot; surplus &quot; we mean the differ-ence between the present insured personnel of the industry and the number of workpeople who can count with reasonable certainty upon obtaining their livelihood from the industry.14. To this figure there must be added a probable permanent surplus in shipbuilding, iron and steel and heavy engineering. In these industries at the end of May there were over 100,000 men wholly unemployed, and while some of these may expect to be reabsorbed the contraction in personnel seems likely to add to the problem on which we are engaged. It seems probable also that, ultimately, certain sections of the textile industry must be prepared to face a permanent contraction of their personnel. The extent and nature, however, of any &quot; surplus &quot; that might emerge in these industries are still matters of hypothesis and we do not therefore make any reference&apos; to the position in our report.
Regional Distribution of the Surplus.15. The surplus in the coal industry is mainly concentrated in large blocks in a few areas. In mid-May in the Northumberland and Durham coalfields slightly over 40,000 men were wholly unem-ployed; in South Wales and Monmouthshire about 55,000, and in Scotland about 25,000. There are &quot; pockets &quot; which, though smaller, none the less present a serious local problem, in other principal coalfields, particularly East Lancashire, the forest of Dean, and in the Midlands, in the Gannock Chase area, and else-where. Concentration is also a feature of the unemployment in the iron and steel and shipbuilding industries carried on, as they are, in close connection with the coalmining industry. The surplus in these industries is probably for the most part in Northum-berland and Durham, South Wales and Lanarkshire.Age Distribution! of the Surplus.16. An indication of the age distribution can be obtained from the results of a sample inquiry into the ages of miners registered as wholly unemployed, made by the Ministry of Labour in May of this year.Out of about 130,000 cases examined of wholly unemployed miners between the ages of 16 and 65, about 1,300 were under 18*; about 30,000 were between 18 and 25 ; about 34,000 were between 26 and 35; about 37,000 were between 36 and 50; and about 2,7,000 were between 51 and 65.Comparable figures for the other heavy industries are not avail-able, but there is no reason to doubt that the age-distribution of unemployed workers in these industries approximates fairly closely to that of workers in the coal industry.Transfer Value of the Surplus.17. The &quot; under 18 &quot; group forms part of the juvenile problem. In no other group is the demoralising influence of unemployment so rapid and so disastrous in its effects. The habit of work has to be learned and to leave school at 14 and to loaf in idleness for one, two, three or more years destroys the will to work. It is to combat this deterioration that numerous centres for unemployed juveniles have been opened in the mining and iron and steel and* These figures must not be taken as any indication, of the extent of the juvenile problem. Owing to the fact that juveniles are not insured under the Unemployment Insurance Scheme until the age of 16, the statistics of unemployment among juveniles must be regarded as very incomplete.
shipbuilding areas. An appreciable proportion of the unemployed juveniles in these areas is now concentrated in the centres, where their sense of discipline is being restored or at any rate maintained. But speedy action is required if the potential transfer value of this group is not to be lost.Although there are in some places indications of an unsatisfied demand for juvenile labour, special arrangements are necessary for transferring young people away from home, and for ensuring that they are properly placed. One practical difficulty in linking supply and demand is that in some cases there is a gap between current wages for boys and the lowest figure at which they can maintain themselves away from home.   (Para. 72.)18. The groups 18 to 25 and 26 to 35 contain a high proportion of men of good transfer value. It is individuals in these groups (and in these groups alone on any large scale) who can find outlets in oversea migration or who can be adapted for employment in a new occupation by training. Here, again, prompt and adequate action is necessary, as young men in these groups deteriorate rapidly when unemployed.19. The groups 36 to 50 and 51 to 65 contain much first-class material and many men in them have a definite transfer value in the home labour market. The transfer of the older miners, apart perhaps from experienced hewers, must, however, present many difficulties.20. There is, we find, in the minds of many an impression that unemployed workers in the heavy industries, and particularly in the coal industry, are of indifferent employment value, that they are not easily adaptable to the requirements of other occupations and that they are themselves unwilling to make the efforts needed for success.   There is, too, some apprehension that these workers] will import into areas to which they may be transferred contagious I elements of unrest and disturbance.   Arising out of such beliefs! and fears we have encountered a real reluctance in many quarters! even to consider the heavy industries, and in particular the coall industry, as a source of labour when recruiting workers.   From! our own knowledge of the material available in the distressed areas! and from the experience of all those who have been brought into! close contact with the workers in these industries, we can affirm! with confidence that this view of the qualities of these workers! is based on ignorance, if not on mere prejudice.   There are unsatis-l factory elements among the workers in the mining industry ail there are in every section of the community and the isolation ill which the industry is frequently carried on has produced an outlook! divorced in some degree from that of the general community.   Bui we are satisfied that, regarded as a type, the British miner is anT example to his fellows.   Part of his inheritance handed down frorf
generation to generation is an instinctive loyalty to his comrades, and a capacity for similar loyalty to his employers, so long as unimaginative handling is not permitted to alienate his sympathy. If he betrays a reluctance to regard movement from his home as a feasible alternative to chronic unemployment this trait must not be regain*ded as unnatural. Of recent years, his political and economic environment has revealed tendencies so conflicting as to baffle even a detached and unaffected observer. Amid all the vacillations of policy which have characterized the history of the mining industry during the past decade, it is scarcely a matter for wonder that the unemnkryed miner should need some real stimulus before he can be expected to uproot his home and seek a better fate in other areas, either in this country or overseas. But that he does deserve a better fate admits of no doubt. We emphasise this aspect of the matter thus early in the report because our whole view of the position is based on a two-fold conviction, that it is a human duty to aid such men and their families, and that their availability for employment gives to other industries an excep-tional opportunity of recruiting personnel of the highest quality.III. POSSIBLE LIMITATION 0&apos;F THE SURPLUS.21. We do not see how the heavy industries will give a living to all those at present attached to them or to all those who &apos; would normally look to them for a livelihood during the next few years. Nevertheless these industries must remain great indus-tries the backbone of the nation&apos;s economic life and their employment capacity remain high. Various measures have been taken or have been suggested (mainly in relation to the coal industry) for limiting the inflow of fresh labour to these industries so as to prevent any unnecessary additions to the surplus, for distributing the labour already in the industry to the best advantage or for removing from the employment market of the industry a number of workers who at present swell the total surplus. If the &quot; surplus &quot; could be reduced in this manner, obviously the problem of transfer would be simplified. It will be convenient here to examine these suggestions.i   22. While the coal industry as a whole appears to be con-tracting, there are scattered developments in progress.   Moreover, the industry has a relatively high rate of wastage which can be replaced from among the industry&apos;s own unemployed.   In order to ensure that development and the replacement of wastage will J benefit the unemployed of the industry, an agreement has been j made&apos; between the Ministry of Labour and the Mining Associa-I lion of Great Britain under Section 18 of the Mining Industry I Act, 1926, with effect from 1st August, 1927, which provides, I broadly, that without the consent of the Minister of Labour, no I worker over 18 years of age may be taken into the coalmining
industry who was not in the industry prior to April, 1926. This in effect has set up a barrier against the entry into the industry of adult labour from other occupations. Statistics prepared for the Coal Commission showed that in 1924 the coal industry re-recruited 25,000 persons from other industries. The net movement in the personnel of the industry during that year (according to Ministry of Labour figures of insured persons) was a slight con-traction. In addition, the industry recruited 30,000 boys and youths from school. Another indication of the labour turnover can be obtained from the figures of unemployment books exchanged annually. The latest figures show that during the year preceding the agreement, i.e., July, 1926, to July, 1927, some 30,000 men of 18 and over left the coal industry to go to other industries and some 17,500 men of 18 and over entered the coal industry from other industries. In addition some 56,000 men ceased to be insured (on account of retirement, death, &amp;c.) and some 40,000 persons entered insured employment in the industry for the first time, the net reduction in the personnel of the industry during the year being just under 30,000. These figures indicate the extent of the wastage.23. It is clearly of importance to use this wastage as a means of securing a more even distribution of employment within the industry by transfers, as opportunity offers, of workers from the depressed areas. This, however, can only be done properly and without waste of effort if it is the normal practice of all colliery managers to replace wastage through the employment exchange system. The collieries are limited in recruiting labour to men already in the industry, but they recognise no obligation, when engaging labour from other areas, to consider the depressed areas. This we consider to be a serious weakness in the present arrangements, and we have therefore approached the Mining Association on the matter. In the result the Association have advised their District Associations to adopt the policy that all demands for men outside those already on colliery books should be notified to and filled through the employment exchanges. The employment exchanges have already classified all wholly unemployed colliery workers according to their suitability and willingness for transfer; if local colliery managers act upon this advice it will be possible to take full advantage of internal wastage and new developments to secure the absorption of workers now unemployed both locally and in the depressed areas.24. We fear, however, that, on balance, the contribution that the industry can make during the next two years towards the absorption of its own surplus may not prove to be great. While the rate of wastage is relatively high, the contrary influences which we have mentioned (para. 12 (4)) are likely to contract tha numbers of those to whom regular employment can be offered.
25. Certain proposals have been put forward designed to restrict the personnel of the industry by withdrawing workers in the youngest and oldest age groups. These proposals are only in-directly related to the problem of transfer but they call for com-ment in so far as they are designed to set limits to the problem to be dealt with by transfer.Raising of the School-Leaving Age.26. It is suggested in some quarters that an obvious improve-ment in employment would follow a withdrawal from the industry of boys between 14 and 16 by the raising of the school-leaving age.27. The suggestion is sometimes for a general raising of the school-leaving age and sometimes for a raising of the age in the areas specially affected by the depression in the heavy industries. The primary object in the minds of some of its advocates is a withdrawal of some juveniles from employment to improve the employment prospects of juveniles in other age groups; others would press the change on the ground that it would prevent de-moralisation through unemployment. (We are not here concerned with the educational considerations which are also urged in favour of the change.)28. We think that compulsorily to raise the school-leaving age, either over the whole country or in certain areas, is a cumbrous method of combating the demoralisation of unemployment and that such demoralisation can be prevented by simpler measures. (Paras. 63 to 66.)29. In so far as the object is the restriction of the available personnel of industry generally, we are impressed by the following considerations. First, the Malcolm Committee on Education and Industry who have studied this question recently,* have found the opinion almost unanimously expressed by those competent to judge that the change would have to be made simultaneously in all areas of the country. They found, further, that even the most optimistic estimates allowed a considerable period of preparation before arrangements could be made to extend the age to 151, the minimum time being about three years. Similarly, the Salvesen Committee on Education and Industry 1 were of opinion that the* Report (First Part) of the Committee on Education and Industry (England and Wales) published by H.M. Stationery Office, 1926.t In England and &quot;Wales under the existing law the age of compulsory attendance can be raised to 15 by bye-law made by the Education Authority concerned. Enforcement of attendance beyond 15 would require new legis-lation. In Scotland it is for the Scottish Education Department to appoint a day for raising the age to 15 years in terms of the statute: there is no statutory provision for raising the age to 16.t First Report of the Committee on Education and Industry in Scotland, published by H.M. Stationery Office, 1927.
raising of the school leaving age to 15 was not immediately prac-ticable in Scotland. These difficulties would, we understand, be most acute precisely in the areas affected by the depression in the heavy industries. Secondly, even if it were practicable to carry out the change in the depressed areas immediately, the change, as a contribution to the transfer problem with which we are alone con-cerned, seems to us to be of doubtful advantage. By preventing the employment of boys of 15 and 16 it would be likely to create a greater demand for the labour of juveniles in the immediately higher age groups (not necessarily equivalent to the amount of labour withdrawn from the market in the lower age groups), but there is room for serious doubt whether it would have a corresponding reaction on the employment of workers of 18 and over. Its general effect, partly by holding-out hopesi of more employment in the future for young persons, would be to anchor them and their parents more firmly to the depressed areas. As we see the position, these areas have at present a larger population than the industries carried on in them can hope to employ. If we are right, and all the evidence supports us, anything which obscures a recognition of this only creates an illusion that is bound to lead to bitter disappointment.30. In the light of these considerations, apart from other objec-tions such as the extra financial burden which would be thrown upon local authorities in distressed areas, we should feel unable, even if it were practicable to cany out the change within a reason-able period of time, to advocate the raising of the school leaving age as a contribution to the problem of transfer. In paragraph 65 we describe measures which will at least go some way to produce the same results.Pensions for Persons of 60 and ov\er.31. This idea has been put forward primarily in connection with the coal industry. It has been suggested that workers of 60 and over might be induced to retire from employment by the grant of pensions. Unless, however, such a scheme could be financed by the coal industry itself it could not be confined to miners, and in fact it seems to us that what would have to be envisaged is either a general pension at 60 at the same rate as under the present contributory pensions scheme, which might completely fail in its purpose of inducing large numbers to retire from employ-ment, or the even more costly alternative of a general raising of the present pension rate and the lowering of the age qualification. The present pensions schemes represent an annual expenditure of  47,500,000. The estimated additional annual cost of the first alternative (10s. a week for men at 60 and 10s. for a wife) is  30,000,000 and of the second alternative ( 1 a week for men at 60, with 10s. a week for a wife, payment continuing at this rate for
life)  60,000,000 to  65,000,000.* We do not enter into the ques-tion of the modifications of detail which would be required in the existing pensions schemes as we think it unnecessary to do more, than draw attention to the scale of expenditure thus involved.Establishment of New Industries in the Depressed Areas.32. A further possibility of reducing the numbers of people in the depressed areas who will have to seek their livelihood in other places lies in the creation of alternative employment in the areas. This can happen only to the extent that manufacturers regard the possibilities as economic. There are some part of the coalfields in which communications are good, the incidence of local taxation will be appreciably lessened by the Governments rating proposals, power is ready to hand, houses are available and there is a working personnel. We therefore (commend seriously to the notice of employers seeking sites for new factories, some practical advantages that ai-e to be found in such areas.IV.   THE PROBLEM.33. We regard the existence of a surplus of labour in some of the heavy industries as a fact, and we think that too much reliance should not be placed on a reduction of this surplus by measures taken within the industries.34. The outstanding feature of unemployment in the heavy industries is that it is &quot; frozen &quot; by its close concentration in or about the coalfields in areas of comparatively small extent. In-dnstrial development within these areas in the past has been highly specialised. In the inland districts, many large communities, e.g. the Rhondda in South Wales, with a population of some 162,000, are dependent on one industry only the coal industry; in others, the only alternative employment outside coalmining is in the iron and steel industries and, to some extent, in shipbuilding. For many years before the war and until about 1920, the history of these areas was one of almost unbroken industrial expansion. Since 1920, however, the continuing depression, affecting all the basic industries simultaneously, has deprived large numbers of persons of their sole means of livelihood. The future of large sections of the population, if they remain in these areas, is most precarious. We are at pains to emphasise this point throughout our report, because a recognition of what it implies by the people in the areas affected is the first and underlying assumption of a transfer policy.35. Until recently, national policy has assumed that industries and areas would return, broadly speaking, to the position they held* These figures are based on the present population. In twenty years&apos; time they would become respectively  35,000,000 and  85,000,000.
before the war; and unemployment policy has been largely one of &quot; tide-over,&quot; the aim being to maintain the labour force required for the industries in the areas in which they were normally con-ducted in a state as free as possible from demoralisation. This was the basis of the policy of relief schemes carried out in depressed areas or employing labour temporarily from the depressed areas.36. From what we have been told by those connected with the industries affected, however, we are definitely led to the belief that it would be unwise to count upon the recovery by certain areas dependent upon the basic industries, and particularly coalmining, of the position they occupied before the war. Our considered opinion is that from now onwards the first aim of policy should be the dispersal of the heavy concentrations of unemployment by the active encouragement of movement from the depressed areas to other areas, both in this country and overseas. This, it seems to us, will provide the only natural and permanent solution of the present unemployment problem in the areas now dependent on the heavy industries.37. A number of difficulties lie in the way. Large units of population engaged in the heavy industries especially in coal-mining in South Wales and Durham, have lived in comparative isolation from the rest of the community ; this has restricted the horizon of many to the narrow circle of one community, or of a small group of communities. The people have known de-pressions in the past, but they have been temporary. Now they are faced with the fact that the industries on which they have depended for generations require a much restricted personnel. But in these areas the sense of ties of home and locality is strongly developed, and is a matter of natural pride. This gives these communities their strength of endurance and cohesion, but it is a psychological factor which operates against a policy of transfer. Further, the physical difficulties standing in the way of the complete absorption of all suitable unemployed workers in the heavy industries into other industries in this country are formidable. While industry is by no means stagnant, no single industry which requires heavy labour is now expanding on the necessary scale. In fact such industries as are expanding to-day, e.g., electrical engineering, motor car manufacture, artificial silk, furniture-making, printing and publishing, are, in the main, machine iv-clustries, which obtain a high rate of productivity with a relatively small labour force. The problem of absorbing a surplus from the heavy industries is also complicated by the fact that many other industries are reorganising themselves upon a labour-saving basis, and if, for various reasons, they are not actually discharging labour, they are in many cases not engaging new labour on a scale which increasing output would otherwise require. Moreover, there is no industry or district in Great Britain where there is not some unemployment, as recorded on the registers of employment
exchanges, and this fact has been used in the past and will be used in the future, by both parties in industry and by local interests as n ground for a plea of enforced inability to assist in the work of transfer.38. The moral to be drawn is, we think, that in many of the districts concerned, the idea of a cyclical or transient depression must now be recognised quite unflinchingly as no longer tenable. The transfer of men to districts not enjoying immunity from un-employment but bearing a relatively lighter load, is the essential and immediate aim of any transfer policy, and the search for openings of employment must not begin and end with the heavy industries or, indeed, with any special class or branch of industry, but must extend to the length and breadth of the land.V. THE BASIS OF A TRANSFERENCE POLICY.39. The difficulties outlined in the foregoing paragraphs are very real, but we refuse to take so pessimistic a view of the adaptability of the workers of this country, of the elasticity of its industry, or of the readiness of employers, workers, and the com-munity at large to co-operate in the solution of a real human problem when the full meaning is brought home to them, as to believe that they are insuperable.40. A transference policy must rest upon three factors : (a) The personal will to move of a man who, looking out soberly at what is before him in his own area, is prepared to take some risks.(b) The active help of employers and workers in all indus-tries, and of all agencies and private persons who have it within their power to bring to realisation this will to move, by giving opportunities for employment, here or overseas.(c) Help where necessary by training and by grants towards the cost of moving, to encourage the will to move.It is from the working of these factors that help in overcoming the difficulties referred to above must be expected.41. The will to move must come first. It is clear that no State policy can succeed without the existence of this will to move. The State can only help those who are prepared to help themselves There are signs that the will to move is already stirring and this is hopeful. The availability of unemployment benefit and poor relief, the reluctance of employers, workers and the State to recognise the contraction in the labour requirements of the heavy industries as more than a transitory problem; the existence of unemployment elsewhere, and the unwillingness to take risks, have all contributed during the past years to a tendency to wait in some vague hope that something will turn up to restore the local trades.   Now, however, some of these influences are ceasing to
operate and the time has come when a real effort should be made to bring home the need for a movement of population away from the depressed areas.42. As an essential condition for the growth of the will to.move, nothing should be done which might tend to anchor men to their home district by holding out an illusory prospect of employment. We therefore reject as unsound policy relief works in the depressed areas. Such schemes are temporary; at the end the situation is much as before, and the financial resources either of the Exchequer or of the Local Authorities, have been drained to no permanent purpose. Grants of assistance such as those made by the Unemployment Grants Committee, which help to finance works carried out by the Local Authority in depressed areas, for the temporary employment of men in those areas, are a negation of the policy which ought in our opinion to be pursued; and, while we recognise the ability with which that Committee have per-formed their functions, we are clear that the continuance or stimulation of their activities would merely retain the unemployed in the depressed areas and put further financial burdens on Local Authorities already very hard hit. If works of this kind are to be undertaken at all, they should be undertaken in areas where employment generally is good, so that they might provide work for unemployed from the depressed areas, with ultimate chances of permanent absorption into industry.43. Similarly, the interests of the unemployed surplus in these areas require that the administration of poor relief and of unem-ployment benefit should not become an artificial barrier to the movement of labour. In areas where regular work in the future for a large proportion of the unemployed is an impossibility, it is essential that the economic stimulus towards transfer to another area to earn a livelihood should not be artificially weakened.44. The personal will to move is the foundation of a transfer-ence policy. It is on the other factors, however-the co-ope&apos;ration of all members of the community who are in a position to assist, and the help by training or otherwise that the practical realisation of such a policy depends. It is upon these factors, and in. particular upon the first for in our view Government action can be of little avail in any attack on this problem without the active help oj the whole community that reliance must in the main be placed to overcome the difficulties in the way of absorption (para. 37). With direct help toward transfer we deal&apos; subsequently. It may be convenient, however, to examine some of the possibilities&quot;^ co-operation.45. Effective transfer on any. scale proportionate to the problem must depend upon absorption within ordinary industry. But it will be urged that, so far as transfers from the depressed areas to other employment in this country are concerned, vacancies can
only be filled at the expense of people already in employment or at the best to the prejudice of unemployed persons in the area. If, accepting this view, we regard the employment market as a static and limited thing, it would be useless for us to give any further thought to possibilities of absorption at home. This is, however, not a true view of the situation in the home employ-ment market. There is a ceaseless ebb and flow of employment, and at all times the employed personnel is constantly changing. Each man taken on is adding to a flowing stream, not driving another out of a space of fixed dimensions. The existence of local unemployment does not make it unnecessary or uneconomic to bring in labour from other areas. It is quite normal to find simul-taueously in the same area unemployment and an unsatisfied demand for labour, because the labour available is not suitable for the vacancies. In districts where the level of unemployment, is low, those who remain unemployed may be of less than the average employment value or persons of special types of skill Dot required at the moment but awaiting engagement in due course. In many districts, particularly in the Midlands and in the Greater London area, unemployment is no longer a social problem affecting a whole community, or pressing for long periods upon large num-bers of all types of skill and aptitude. The statistical machine created by the Unemployment Insurance Acts, while it records all passing movements in the employment market, distinguishes in-sufliciently between the various kinds of unemployment. A town with a large variety of industries carried on in small establishments, each subject to the normal fluctuations of demand, may show 10 per cent, of unemployment on the live register of the employ-ment exchange, but, considered in its human and social aspects, such a figure may be of utterly different significance from that of an identical figure of unemployment if arising, for example, in a small area which depends almost entirely on three or four collieries. It would be serious if any confusion between these kinds of unem-ployment were to stand in the way of a policy of transfer of labour required by industry. Moreover, many of the workers in the heavy industries now unemployed are of high employment value. At a time of good or relatively good trade such as is now being enjoyed in a number of areas in this country, many employers are pre-pared to make an effort to start a good man. There are, in fact, many potential vacancies in industry &quot; at the margin &quot; which materialise upon the appearance of a suitable man for the job. This lias been proved in practice by the experience gained in canvassing lor places for trainees from the Government training centres for j work in this country. In drawing upon the depressed areas for their workpeople, employers need not fear that they are being called opon to subordinate economic efficiency to sentiment. There are. j in those areas many men of the highest employment value willing, I if only an opportunity offers, to give loyal and skilful service, and
organised transfer offers employers an opportunity of strengthening; their labour personnel.46. We do not claim, of course, that a policy of transfer, how-ever well-organised, will in the present state of industry and trade, lead to the complete absorption in this country of all the unem-ployed within a short time. But it can be made to produce the-absorption of many, to open up more chances, and to distribute more equally the incidence and burden of unemployment. Pending a general trade improvement these would be substantial gains. It is positively uneconomic, to judge it from this standpoint alone, to leave in areas where a trade revival is unlikely, a reserve of labour which could be made available for industrial development in areas where general trade activity is much more brisk. It is right in a general sense that London and the Midlands, where the level of unemployment is relatively low (e.g., May, 1928, Greater London, 4.8 per cent.; Leicestershire, 4.5 per cent. ; Northampton-shire, 6.0 per cent.; Warwickshire, 6.9 per cent. ; Hertfordshire, 2.4 per cent.; Bedfordshire, 3.8 per cent; Buckinghamshire, 2.9 per cent.) should make their contribution towards the redistribution-tribution of the burden of the depressed areas, e.g., Glamorgao-shire, 24.2 per cent.; Monmouthshire, 19.9 per cent.; Durham, 21.0 per cent. ; Northumberland, 16.7 per cent, (and, as examples of the concentration of unemployment, Merthyr Tydfil 62.3 per cent.; Blaina, 48.6 per cent.; Dowlais, 38.8 per cent.; Bishop Auckland, 42 per cent.; Gateshead, 30.3 per cent. ; South Shields, 24.9 per cent.).47. Within these limits then, we think it is possible to make an appreciable contribution to the solution of the problem of the depressed areas by a transfer policy within this country, and in a manner which will not react to the permanent prejudice of workers in areas to which transfers may take place. Success in such a policy requires the co-operation of employers and workers and, indeed, of all interests and individuals in these areas. Such co-operation demands high qualities of imagination and sympathy. We cannot believe that these will not be forthcoming at the proper time. We would only advise those who feel doubt about the need for, and the justice of a policy of transfer to visit for them-selves such areas as the mining valleys of Wales, and the colliery villages of Northumberland and Durham, Lanarkshire or Fife, and to compare conditions in these areas with conditions prevail-ing in their own areas.48. But even if goodwill and practical sympathy be taken for granted, it may appear at first sight that the problem is baffling bj its magnitude, especially if the solution is sought in some simple but all-embracing expedient. The surplus of at least 200,000 looks an alarming number. How, it may be asked, can anyone suggest a scheme for absorbing 200,000 persons?   Certain facts must,
however, be remembered. We have indicated the. elasticity of the employment market and its changing personnel. Every week in the year there are at least 120,000 labour engagements. Within variations in employment on this scale, there is obviously room for the inclusion of appreciable numbers from the depressed areas.: Further, in addition to this elasticity, the general absorptive: capacity of industry is steadily on the increase; notwithstanding a period of relative depression, industry has added, during the four years July, 1923, to July, 1927, rather over 850;000 persons, to its employed personnel. And there is an important factor that, promises to make the problem more soluble. The rate of increase in the population of the country generally is slackening, a fact which is illustrated by a comparison of the numbers of persons who attained 14 and 15 years of age in 1911 and 1921 with the number who will attain these ages in 1928, 1931, and 1940. In-1911, 1,545,000 males and females in Great Britain attained the ages of 14 and 15; in 1921, 1,641,000. In 1928 it is estimated that the number will fall to 1,602,000; in 1931, to 1,382,000, and after a rise beginning in 1934, will be 1,384,000 in 1940.* It will be seen from these figures that the number of potential re-emits available for work in industry is at present falling and will continue to fall for some years.49. These considerations bring the problem of absorbing the&apos; surplus from the heavy industries into proper perspective; the task is difficult, but not impossible. Industry is indeed like a living organism in its capacity to adapt itself and to take on new-growth.VI. EXISTING MACHINERY ASSISTING TRANSFER OF LABOUR IN THIS COUNTRY.50. There are already a number of Government agencies at work assisting the mobility of workers and their transfer to other-areas or occupations, or helping to equip them for such transfer-in this country. The most important of these are the employment exchanges, the training centres for. young men, the juvenile un-employment centres, and the training centres for women.The Employment Exchange System.51. There are at the present time some 400 employment exchanges situated in all important towns and large industrial centres throughout the country and some 750 branch employment offices in less important centres.    This system provides a ready* Figures published by the Committee on Industry and Trade see page 399, Survey of Industrial Relations published by H.M. Stationery Office, 1926, and page 150, Factors in Industrial and Commercial Efficiency, Part I,, published 1927.
means on a national scale of bringing employers &quot;who desire work-people and workpeople seeking employment, both adults and juveniles, into touch with one another. The exchanges are avail-able to both without charge. Special machinery is provided for meeting employers&apos; requirements which cannot be satisfied locally, and workers who find employment at a distance through an ex-change may receive an advance of money to enable them to pay their fares to travel to their new employment. Through the machinery provided by the exchanges constant movement from one area to another in this country is already proceeding. (In certain areas in England and Wales, including most of the im-portant large towns outside London, the responsibility for the administration of employment agency work and unemployment insurance for juveniles has been undertaken by Local Education Authorities.)Training Centres for Adults for Employment in this Country.52. The Government have established four training centres at Wallsend, Birmingham, Dudley and Bristol, for young unemployed men up to the age of 25 (29 for ex-service men), of which those at Bristol and Dudley have been brought into being during the last three months. A further centre will shortly be opened in Scotland. The number of places at present available is 1,600, and the annual turnover about 3,500 trainees a year. The new Scottish centre will add about 150 places and about 300 to the turnover. The training is designed to improve general employability, to teach workshop discipline and the use of tools, to equip the men in fact to obtain work in occupations other than those in which their sole prospects would lie if they remained in their home areas. The courses last for a maximum of six months; men from distant areas are accommodated at lodgings near the centres. A high proportion of the men now undergoing training are miners and, on the basis of past experi-ence, the prospects of employment for men at the end of their courses are good over 90 per cent, of the men trained to date have been placed in employment in Great Britain, the majority in jobs with a prospect of continuity.Juvenile Unemployment Centres.53. Juvenile unemployment centres are of long standing, but the provision of centres has recently been widely extended in the Durham and Northumberland and South Wales . coalfields. Pro-vision is also being made in the Scottish coalfields. There are now about 2,000 boys, the greater number of whom are between the
ages of 16 and 18, in attendance at centres in the coalfields.* These centres are designed, by keeping young unemployed boys and girls interested and under discipline and engaged in useful occu-pations or recreation, to prevent the demoralisation which so quickly sets in among juveniles of these ages when unemployed. In the centres for boys which have recently been opened in the depressed areas, a manual element has been included in the curriculum of the centres and an endeavour is being made by training in the use of tools, e.g., in woodwork and simple metalwork, to turn the minds of these boys away from the only occupation of which they have thought in their home areas towards a new life in another area. Special attention is being given to the task of securing vacancies for these boys in other parts of the country; there is provision for paying the fares of boys transferred to employment in distant areas.Training for Women.54. Training of women between the ages of 18 and 35 and of some girls between the ages of 16 and 18 for domestic service has for some years been carried out by the Central Committee for Women&apos;s Training as part of the normal programme of unem-ployment relief work, and a number of centres have been opened in South Wales, on the North-East Coast and in Scotland. The Committee have now been empowered to extend this provision and 16 new centres will shortly he open in the depressed areas. At these new centres special facilities for the training of younger girls (16 to 18) are being provided to equip them to enter domestic service in other areas.VII. POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS OF FACILITIES FOR TRANSFER LN THIS COUNTRY.Employment Exchanges.55. We think it essential that public emphasis should be laid on the contribution that the employment exchange system can make to the problem, if it is properly supported by employers. The value of the employment exchanges lies not so much in the register of local unemployed that each exchange maintains, as in the closely articulated system which is in contact with the unemployed of all degrees of skill and aptitude in all areas through-out Great Britain. There can thus be brought to the employer the widest possible field from which he can select with complete freedom of choice. From discussions with employers we have gathered that there is an impression that the selection of personnel,* The attendance at all centres throughout the country at the end of May totalled about 4,250 boys and 1,250 girls.
obviously a matter of first importance for efficient production, will be hampered in some way if the employer has recourse to the employment exchanges. This is not so. There is no obligation On any employer to take any men submitted to him by the employ-ment exchange or indeed any particular man. What the exchanges do is to make available for selection by the employer or his fore-man a much wider field of accessible and suitable candidates than can be obtained by any other agency, and the more they are&quot; entrusted by employers with the task of initial selection, the more accurately will they respond to the employers&apos; requirements. Already some of the largest employers in the country, employing men of all degrees of skill, regularly look to the exchanges to make the initial selection of labour for them. The more this practical method is adopted, the sooner can be brought into productive employment many of the men of first-class quality now in the depressed areas and dependent mainly upon the exchanges in those areas for their contact with other areas where employment is more active.56. The exchanges, however, are not yet making the contribu-tion of which they are capable, partly because employers have refrained from using them for various reasons, of which the chief, we are satisfied, is because the facilities they offer are not fully understood, and partly because, occupied as they have been ever since 1920 in administering the complicated and ever-changing scheme of unemployment insurance, they have not been able to devote to the employment agency side of their work the full atten-tion which this side of the work merits, and have failed to advertise effectively this aspect of their activity. It is clearly of the first importance that the Ministry of Labour should continue to develop with all the means at their disposal the employment agency side of the employment exchange activities; and they should consider wider and more effective publicity to make known to employers the facilities they offer than they have used in the past.57. We are not concerned to propose a fuller use of the employ-ment exchanges merely because they are a Government institution. But the present unemployment in the coal industry and one or two other industries involves a heavy financial burden upon the country as a whole to which industry is required to contribute. This burden cannot be appreciably lessened unless other industries will co-operate, and to make that co-operation effective the exchanges offer a means which cannot be found in any other agency. Whatever value may be attached to training as an aid to transfer, and we attach a high value, still it is by means of direct transfer without training that movement from one area to another must, in the main, take place if it is to be on a seals commensurate with the problem. And we look to the employment exchanges to play an important part in initiating and making possible through their widespread organisation movements of labour of this kind.
58. On this subject, therefore, we feel justified in making an appeal to all employers, not already making the maximum use of employment exchanges, to acquaint themselves fully with their machinery and to establish a routine whereby requirements for men both to make good normal wastage and to undertake new work are at once communicated to the exchanges. We confidently believe that no enlightened employer whatever may be his pre-conceptions about the inherent improbability of a Government in-stitution rendering a useful service to industry will ignore our appeal, which flows from a profound conviction on our part of the great good that its acceptance can bring to all concerned.59. Employment exchanges have power to advance fares to be deducted subsequently from wages and those who are insured under the unemployment insurance scheme may obtain a grant from the unemployment fund towards the cost of their journey. These aids are of value, but there are other financial difficulties, apart from the cost of the journey to another area, standing in the way of transfer. In the case of married men, for instance, the difficulty of maintaining two homes, for at any rate some short period, must frequently arise. It is often difficult for a married man, who has been unemployed possibly for a prolonged period. to take his family into a new area until he has found a Lome for them. Until he finds this, he must usually live in lodgings. But his wages are rarely sufficient to maintain two homes. A further difficulty which faces married men,, even after they have found a new home and overcome the initial difficulty of maintaining two homes, is that of meeting the cost of removal, of their family and furniture. Many of these men are already heavily in debt in their home areas and can incur no further lia-bilities.60. The cumulative effect of these financial difficulties is, we are satisfied, to create a great reluctance even to consider a transfer to another area on the part of men who have households to main-tain. Such men form probably about one-half of the unemployed population of the depressed areas. It is obviously unfair both to the community and the individual that the chances of transfer from idleness to employment should be reduced for these reasons. Immediate action is necessary. Funds from private sources may be available, particularly for juveniles, to assist in the provision of clothing and outfits, where these are necessary to increase the chances of acceptance by employers. For married men, however, we kve come to the conclusion that further help is necessary. Author-ity has accordingly been obtained for advances to be made through the employment exchanges in suitable cases towards the cost of. removal expenses and towards the maintenance for short periods-of the families of married men who take up employment in other areas but have not immediately found accommodation for their
family, and, where it proves necessary, for an advance of wages to a married man who may have to wait several days after entering employment before he receives his first payment of wages. All these advances are by way of loan, and in our judgment rightly so; but repayment is by easy instalments and there is power, in approved cases, to grant a short initial moratorium. It is impor-tant that full publicity to these arrangements should be given throughout the depressed areas.Training Centres for Adults.61. These centres are in our view an important bridge from the depressed areas to other employment. They encourage the indi-vidual will to move, more particularly in the case of young-men who have lost confidence or employability through a long period of idleness. Whether the trainee is placed in employ-ment immediately upon completion of the course and obviously every effort should be. made to secure this^-or not, he will have definitely benefited from this course in outlook as well as industrial fitness. He will have come into contact with other occupations and a wider world of opportunity; he will have regained in part his self-reliance, which should be an important aim in policy.62. In the course of our work we have advocated extension of these training centres and this has resulted in the establishment of new centres at Bristol and Dudley, in enlargements at others and in the steps which are now being taken to open a new centre in Scotland. The value of these centres is denied by nobody. At the same time there are limits to their indefinite extension set by the capacity of industry to absorb trainees at the end of their training. The incentive to make use of his training is very much greater when the trainee knows that at the end of his course em-ployment with prospects is almost certainly assured to him. If such a virtual assurance as there has been up to the present during the working of the scheme could no longer be given, one of its attractions would disappear. We have no reason, however, to think that the present output of the training centres is equal to the capacity of industry to absorb men of the character we have our-selves seen under training and we are satisfied that the Ministry of Labour should be empowered without delay to set up new-centres to the fullest extent justifiable by the prospect of a reason-able degree of successful placing at the end of the training period.Juvenile Unemployment Centres.63. These centres also we regard as a valuable bridge from the depressed areas. They have this year been greatly extended and in our view this policy should be continued and further attention should
be paid to sucli areas as Lancashire, Cannpck Chase and the Scot-tish coalfields so as to ensure that no large pockets of juvenile unemployment are neglected.64. When discussing (para. 28) the question of the school-leaving age we indicated that in so far as this change was advocated as a means of preventing demoralisation, we thought the same end could be achieved by less cumbrous means. A suggestion has been put forward (a variant of the suggested raising of the school-leaving age) that in the depressed areas children should attend school com-pulsorily until they obtain employment. The administration of such a system by the Local Education Authority would not be easy and in any case, as the Malcolm Committee point out, it does not benefit the juvenile who leaves school to take up employment but thereafter becomes unemployed. If, however, it were necessary to introduce the more general measures of compulsion referred to in paragraph 66 this suggestion might deserve further considera-lion.65. A modified form, however, of this suggestion, and one which has recently had the support of the Malcolm Committee, appeals to us. Parents are at present encouraged to keep their children at school until they actually find employment for them and an appreciable number of children over 14 years of age do attend in these circumstances. We think that it is important that as many parents as possible should be encouraged to follow this practice and that the Central Education Authorities should con-tinue to stimulate the interest of Local Authorities in the matter. This would not mean the imposition of any new obligation on Local Education Authorities ; the obligation to provide for such children whose parents wish them to remain at school beyond the age of 14 already exists. It is important, however, that parents should feel assured that children staying on in the schools will have a better chance of obtaining employment and for this purpose the Ministry of Labour should make arrangements whereby children over school age in the elementary schools will, so far as possible, be offered an equal chance with boys of similar age at juvenile unemployment centres.66. For the purpose of preventing demoralisation among unem-ployed juveniles after they have left school the machinery of the juvenile unemployment centres seems to be well adapted. The juveniles now in attendance at them have been for the most part claimants for unemployment benefit attending as a condition of the receipt of benefit. Under changes introduced by the Unem-ployment Insurance Act, 1927, as from the 19th April, 1928, many of these juveniles have ceased to be entitled to benefit at all and some have ceased to attend the centres. At the same time appreci-able numbers of juveniles not claiming benefit have always attended
and more boys will no doubt be attracted to the centres if their reputation as bridges to employment in other areas becomes firmly established. The fact remains, however, that the boys most in need of discipline tend to stay away from the centres. We.are so impressed with the dangers of demoralisation among these lads from the point of view of the transfer problem that we think that, if in the near future a substantial number of unemployed juveniles are not in attendance at centres, the question of introducing legisla-tion to make attendance compulsory for juveniles who are unem-ployed in areas to be scheduled and are not attending school, should be seriously considered.VIII.   OPENINGS FOE EMPLOYMENT IN THIS COUNTRY67. However perfect the machinery for transfer, it is useless unless openings can be found for those transferred. We have already referred to the elastic working of the employment market and have indicated the general absorptive capacity of industry. There are opportunities for employment, but employment can only be obtained if it is looked for. Nor should exclusive reliance be placed on State agencies for this. State agencies and State action can help, but the problem of unemployment in the depressed industries is one which can only be solved if the whole comrmiinity realises its existence and consciously resolves to grapple with it. It is legitimate to- expect every physically fit unemployed man to exert himself to the utmost on his own behalf. Active co-operation is required, not only from employers, large and small, but from all individuals who are in a position to offer work of any kind which has reasonable continuity or holds prospects of bringing the workman into contact with such work. Apart from private employment there are, it is estimated, some 120,000 employers of labour who normally employ more than five workers. If only even half of these, when they came into the employment market, would make it their business to give employment to one man or two men from the depressed areas, a real step would have been taken towards a solution. Private persons, too,can make their contribution ; there are available men and youths, boys and girls, willing to take up any situation, And, needless to say, we hold that there is a special responsibility oil Public Authorities, central and local, which place important con-tracts, to indicate to their contractors that every opportunity must be sought, when collecting personnel for the fulfilment of the con-tracts, to find employment for some men from the depressed areas,68. Quite apart from an ordinary human recognition of the tragedy that has overtaken whole communities, we are impressed bj the fact that the chronic unemployment in the depressed areas lies like a cloud over the whole industrial horizon and lowers over all
industrial discussions, and that employers will find a new attitude from organised labour towards many industrial questions if by co-operative action, this dark cloud can be removed.69. Through the employment exchange system, employers are being continuously canvassed on behalf of the trainees. Ar-rangements have recently been made to increase these activities considerably. All employers are continuously trying to improve their personnel, particularly in prosperous industries, and this fact should be turned to advantage by steady canvassing on behalf of the men from the depressed areas. All new industrial develop-rnents and the allocation of important contracts are being watched, and efforts are being made to take advantage of such opportunities as those provided by the demand for seasonal labour, e.g., in the beet-sugar industry. In that industry arrangements have been made for employment to he given to suitable men from the depressed areas for singling and lifting beet and for factory employment. There is, in present circumstances, a special obligation on the beet-sugar industry to give whatever help it can to this end. A problem which is also being studied is that arising out of the employment of Irish immigrant labour, a practice followed by some of the large works contractors. The practice is of long standing and is usually explained by reference to the special capacity of this labour for heavy manual work. In so far as this is the explanation, the continuance of this practice is, in present circum-stances, quite unnecessary; there are available numbers of miners well suited to such work. Indeed, we already have experience that one or two employers, who have been accustomed to engage Irish immigrant labour on a considerable scale for seasonal work, have recognised the convenience of having similar labour available much closer at hand, and have engaged unemployed miners for the work through the employment exchanges.70. We attach great importance to the establishment and main-tenance of personal touch with large employers by the appropriate agents of Government with a view to securing their goodwill and inducing them to absorb trainees from the various training centres and to give consideration, when taking on new labour, to workers from the depressed areas. As instances of this co-operation we may mention that certain transport companies have engaged a number of miners as conductors, and that other important productive concerns are so impressed with the value of the men from the training centres that they are arranging to take a regular supply. In fact, iti no case in which a direct appeal has been made for practical help, has there been any lack of sympathy, or any reluctance to assist. We are encouraged to believe that it is only necessary to state clearly that the problem before this country can be solved by a large number of small offers of help, for that help to be forthcoming.
Juveniles.71; So far as mere numbers are concerned, the juvenile problem is the most manageable in size, though in many ways the most urgent, of the various parts of the whole transfer problem. The demand for juvenile labour in the country generally is steady and effective, and the incidence of unemployment upon juveniles is, for the country as a whole, appreciably lighter than upon adults. There, is, too, a further factor likely to stimulate the competition for juvenile labour in the next few years (para. 48). As a result of. the fall in the birth rate in the early years of the war, the number of boys and girls leaving school will steadily diminish until 1934. There will then be an upward movement for a few years, followed by a further sharp decline.&apos; These facts are already appreciated by far-sighted employers.72. Canvassing to find vacancies for boys from the de-pressed areas has been going on for some time, and a certain number have already been placed in new employment in other areas. In so far as the jobs found have made it necessary for the boy to live away from home, it has only been possible to effect placings in occupations where the wage paid is sufficient to meet the cost of board and lodging. Many vacancies, however, where such wages are not payable (especially in trades offering training in skilled employment) have been notified. In some few cases the boys may have relatives with whom they can lodge; imTsome-the gap between wages and the cost of maintenance has already been narrowed by the public-spirited offer of employers to pay an extra allowance to juveniles transferred from the depressed areas. We hope that these offers will be extended. Local Authorities, too, have offered to co-operate. Where such co-operation by employers and others is offered we think it would be legitimate that some of the voluntary funds collected in response to the Lord Mayor&apos;s Appeal should be used to bridge the gap still remaining, and, in fact, a start has already been made in applying a portion of the money subscribed to this purpose.73. The Local Education Authorities, who in most of the large industrial towns in England and Wales outside London, are re-sponsible for the work of placing juveniles, are co-operating with the Ministry of Labour in the search for vacancies in the areas under their control, and we look to them for an important contri-bution to the problem. Some of these Authorities with their special local responsibilities may feel reluctance to welcome to their areas juveniles from other areas. We have heard already of cases in which Authorities are looking forward with equanimity to the coming shortage in their areas; they see in it only the possibilities of benefiting the position of the juveniles already in their charge.   It would be regrettable if this short-sighted attitude
were to be adopted at all generally by Authorities in the more prosperous areas. We do not think it will be. When.the extent of the problem and the needs of the young lads in the depressed areas are made known, and when it is realised that any single area need be called upon to receive a mere handful of youngsters-an influx so small that it is inconceivable that it can have any depress-ing effect on wages and conditions generally we do not think that any narrow local preoccupations will stand in the way.74. Even if all financial and practical difficulties are overcome, however, there will still remain cases where these difficulties are not the only obstacle in the way of transfer. The unwillingness of parents to let thsir children leave home and the fear of unsatis-factory associations in their new occupations may prove equally real obstacles. Action to overcome these must, we think, be left in the main to private effort and initiative. The admirable example set by such bodies as Juvenile Advisory Committees and Juvenile Employment Committees, and such societies as the Young Men&apos;s Christian Association, the Church Army, the Salvation Army, the Church of England Men&apos;s Society and Toe H., in this field might well be emulated. The State provides in the centres machinery for mitigating demoralisation and assists in find-ing an opportunity of employment; we think that by the co-operation of employers and by the use of voluntary funds the gap between wages and the cost of living will be bridged where necessary. We look to private initiative and to the beneficent help of such voluntary bodies and organisations to supply those influences in the boys&apos; new homes which parents may rightly expect to surround their children in adolescence, and so to overcome the natural reluctance which may deprive the youngsters of a new start in life. We do not think it necessary to stress the responsibility that rests upon parents in these areas to consider seriously the future of their children, but we hope that at the schools also every encouragement will be given to the boys and gills to think about openings in other areas and other trades.75. In a comparatively short period a real inroad could be made, we are convinced, into the problem of unemployment among juveniles in the depressed areas by concerted effort in this country. Such an achievement requires continuous efforts by the Ministry of Labour and by Local Education Authorities, the laying aside of local prejudices in the knowledge of the greater need outside, and above all, the real co-operation of all employers of juvenile labour, first by offers of employment and later by being ready to realise the difficulties of the youngster uprooted from his home and to make easier the change-over to a new life. For this co-operation we now appeal, addressing our appeal, as in the last resort we must, not solely to organisations, either Governmental or local, but rather to the thousands of private persons in whose1 hands rests the key to this achievement.
The Older Men.76. It is obviously easier to transfer the boys and the younger men, and we recognise that most of the suggestions we have already outlined will affect mainly these classes. But the older men-men over 36 represent rather more than half the total of those likely to form the surplus. They cannot satisfactorily be dealt with by any of the training arrangements, nor are they likely, on the whole, to go overseas in any considerable numbers. They constitute the most difficult part of the problem; it is particularly a part that can only be solved with the co-operation of all con-cerned, including the men themselves.77. Such men would, of course, be entitled to the support of the normal employment exchange machinery, and it will not be difficult to ensure that their cases receive full attention. They would also benefit by the extended transfer facilities which we have suggested in respect of married men (para. 60). Some families may move if their children can be placed in suit-able employment, and this possibility is being borne in mind. For various reasons, however, it is much more difficult to find suitable: vacancies for married men with dependants ; there is, for example, the housing or lodging difficulty. Younger men may be expected to fend for themselves by moving to places where they know that there are many more chances of employment, even though at the time of their departure they may not have a specific job to which they can go. But on behalf of the older men we think we are justified in making a special appeal for co-operation from all employers. Very many of them are still in the prime of their industrial life and activity and want work. Many have young children not yet of an age to earn for themselves or to make any. contribution towards the upkeep of their parents. In our visits to these areas nothing saddened us so much as to see young boys idle and aimless, and fathers of families growing desperate at their inability to bring up their children in decent self-dependence. A critical attitude towards the order of society is, among the young, a natural and, in many respects, a healthy sign; but when older and more serious men are brooding over a situation so much against their wishes and efforts that it looks like an injustice imposed from without, a society that makes no effort to help them may one day be called upon to pay a heavy reckoning. These married men are looking for help, with anxiety though not yet with dangerous bitterness. It is not without con-1 fidence that we make an appeal for them. It is in their case [ particularly that the collective effort of all members of the com-munity to find work would make a contribution to the problem, I for which we can look to no.other agency.
78. It has been represented to us from various quarters that a valuable outlet could be found for many of the older men with, families in schemes of land settlement in this country. Many miners&apos; families have had actual experience of agriculture, while many more are only one generation removed from the land. They are inured to hard work and frequently live in the midst of or on the edge of purely agricultural country. It is suggested, too, that, the apathy with which the possibilities of migration overseas are undoubtedly regarded by many workers is due in part at least to a feeling that there is scope for the settlement of more people on the land in this country and that this apathy might be dispelled if it were more generally realised that a real effort to encourage such settlement were being made. We have accordingly thought it right to examine the possibilities which settlement on the land in this country may offer.Agricultural Small Holdings.79. The obvious and most frequently advocated method.of creat-ing openings for families on the land, with agriculture conducted as it is to-day, is by the sub-division of farms into small holdings. We have been advised that, on the assumption that small holdings are to be provided for, say, 1,000 families, of a sufficient area to enable the occupier to maintain himself and his family, together with a dwelling house, farm buildings and a small amount of farm capital, the average cost of settling each family is estimated at between  1,500 and  2,000 in England and Wales and rather less in Scotland. From this expenditure an economic return by way of rent Would be obtained from about one-third. The remainder would have to be advanced free of interest. The formation of small holdings is, at present, a matter for county councils in; England and Wales, and in Scotland for the Board of Agriculture. There are already long waiting lists of unsatisfied applicants, many with previous agricultural experience.80. It will be seen that  1 million pounds spent on smallholdings would probably settle between 500 and 700 families on the land. The cost of providing for a scheme of agricultural small holdings, on a scale commensurate with the problem (for the resettlement of, say, 5,000 to 7,000 families) would therefore be in the&apos; neigh-: bourhood of  10 millions. It must be remembered, too, that the successful conduct of a small holding in this country requires skill, experience and determination in the face of adverse conditions, and the risk of bad seasons.81. In such. circumstances, we hesitate, attractive as small holdings  may appear as a method of dealing with the unemploy-ment of the older men, to suggest at the present time the initiation
of extensive schemes of land settlement on ordinary agriculural small holdings.Forest Holdings.f 82. We have also examined a scheme for settlement on the land in connection with the afforestation programme. This scheme possesses certain advantages over an ordinary land settlement scheme from the point of view of men with families from the depressed areas. Small holdings are formed in close proximity to forests, on plots of agricultural land acquired in connection with land for afforestation. The holder is guaranteed a substantial period&apos; of work for wages on the forest land in the year and there are opportunities, too, for members of his family to find work. Large families are an asset; relatively little agricultural experience is required, but ability to undertake heavy.labouring work is essential. The cost of forming holdings (about  625 per holding, subject to some return in the shape of rent) is very considerably less than the cost of ordinary small holdings; the risk of failure is not great; and the chances of finding suitable families among the unemployed in the depressed industries, and particularly in the mining industry, are good. The work done by the holder is, moreover, work that must be done iu the ordinary course of planting and maintaining the forests, which are national assets appreciating steadily in value j with the years. On an examination of the possibilities, we have come to the conclusion that the settlement of families on forest! holdings might be made to provide a very useful, even if limited, contribution towards the problem of the older men. Some steps have already been taken in the recruitment of families from the I depressed areas to take up holdings formed as part of their normal [ programme and a number of families have in fact taken up hold-ings. What has already been done has shown that there are nianjj families in the depressed areas who would make suitable forestj holders.83. The Forestry Commission are completing a ten-year pro I gramme in 1929 and a further ten-year programme will then bel started. This programme includes provision for the systematic! formation of forest holdings. We are so impressed by the possif bilities of the forest holdings scheme that in our view every effort should immediately be made to create during the next three yearf sufficient holdings for at least 1,000 families from the depressel areas. This could be done partly by making up past arrears aniif partly by accelerating the creation of holdings under the normal planting programmes. In order that a proper balance betweel forest and holdings may be maintained, it would also, we under! stand, involve the acquisition of additional land for plantinl purposes.- .
84. Viewing the possibilities of the home employment market, we are not pessimistic of ultimate results if the community bestirs itself to give t\&amp; help that is in its power. Nevertheless, it is clear that the industrial structure of the country has altered from that created in the xixth Century; the markets for heavy products from Great Britain have contracted, and methods of production have been improved so that the available markets can be supplied by a reduced personnel. It is true that development in other industries will tend to restore the general economic balance, and no doubt in time this development will lead to an increasing demand for labour. But, at the best, this is a slow process. In the mean-time hardship will continue, and involved in this will be many of the best types of workmen and their children.85. The present situation cannot be adequately studied without some reference to the subject of migration from this country. We have made clear our view that certain areas are at present carrying an industrial population too big for their needs; this population must move, and it is natural, therefore, that within the British Empire, whose lands offer such varied oppor-tnnities, we should examine the question of movement to those lands as well as within the borders of these islands. We have not approached the question from any narrow view of the intei-ests of this country. There is no conflict between our interests and those of the Dominions. In many ways the Dominions still draw much -of their strength from the Mother Country and both benefit. If Great Britain is prosperous and buoyant in outlook, immediately, in financial aid and otherwise, there is a beneficial reaction upon the Dominions. Similarly, while our acute difficulties persist, the Dominions must feel the effects.86. No question is so fateful for the destiny of the British Commonwealth of Nations as a proper distribution of the people of British stock throughout its territories. The ties that bind the Commonwealth together are not formal alliances, or commercial treaties, but the living ties of kinship, and it is part of the expressed policy of the self-governing Dominions to keep fresh those ties by&quot; en con raging the entry to their lands of British people. When we find, therefore, so small a flow of migration from this country to the Dominions, we are bound to examine the matter in some, detail, especially when we know of so many men and families who would make admirable settlers, and who are looking for chances to re-establish themselves in productive employment.87. This does not mean that we associate emigration and unem-ployment in the sense that we are concerned to ask the Dominions to share our industrial difficulties. We do not. There is no ques-fcion here of dumping unemployables.    The effects of migration
upon the unemployment situation in this country are, mainly, indirect. A steady increase in migration of all classes will create more openings here for those who are disinclined or unsuitable for life overseas, and will create extended markets for our own products overseas in return for the primary products of the Dominions. At the same time we are justified in expecting that those of our unem-ployed who are suitable shall be given opportunities and a welcome overseas. It is useless to ignore the certainty that if some of the younger unemployed are to have fuller chances of becoming pro-ductive members of the community before the rust of an enforced idleness has eaten into their character, they must be helped to find chances in the wider lands of the Dominions. With all the human misery and economic waste of the problem before us, we feel that it would be deplorable that such opportunities as the British Empire has to offer should, through lack of organised effort here or overseas, or for other causes, hs denied to British workpeople.88. At this stage we think it necessary to comment on a calumny which has gained some currency both here and overseas about the -quality of the unemployed.   A misunderstanding so obstinate in -certain quarters as to appear deliberate, of our whole system of unemployment insurance, an attitude summed up in the word &quot; dole,&quot; has created an impression that the unemployed are un-employable, that they could easily find work if they wished, but that they prefer to live in idleness on money derived from the State.   The misconceptions in this attitude are so obviously absurd to anyone who studies, however cursorily, the industrial history of the last few years that we should not have thought it necessary to refute them had we not been struck by their prevalence in some quarters in the Dominions and by the damage that they cause to our people.   The Unemployment Insurance scheme is a contribu-tory scheme to which the workmen of this country contribute, out of. their  wages,  one-third of  the total cost.    No unemployed workman can draw benefits under the scheme unless he satisfies stringent  conditions among others, he must show that he is genuinely seeking work.   Every impartial body that has examined -this   scheme,   notably   the   Committee   under   the   Chairman-ship of Lord Blanesburgh which reported in 1927,*  has found that the allegations of general abuse are wholly without foundation The body . of unemployed is not a standing army of vagrants and loafers,, but a number of genuine industrial workers whose coin-position is constantly changing.   There are, of course,  &quot; work-shy &quot; among them, as there are in every section of society, and ill every country, but for the most part the unemployed are, at any time, a fair sample of the whole body of the industrial work-people of this country.   There is no country which would not be*Report of tho Unemployment Insurance Committee, published by H.M. Stationery Office, 1927.

In New Zealand there are 12; in Canada 2J; in South Africa 3 (white); in Australia nearly 2. Canada is larger in extent than the United States of America, Australia is very nearly as large; the population of Canada is not much more than that of London, and of Australia less than that of London.In South Africa and Rhodesia the immigration of white persons to work as wage earners is severely restricted by the colour ques-tion. It is ordinarily in Canada, Australia and New Zealand that the chances for any large numbers of migrants from these islands are to be found.90. In Appendix I are shown the figures of migration from.the United Kingdom to Canada, Australia and New Zealand, from 1900 to 1927 -omitting the. years affected by the war, 1914-1922.Two striking facts stand out from these figures : (a) British migration into the Dominions since the war has fallen markedly, as compared with the period 1909-13. Migration into Canada averaged over 100,000 annually during 1909-1913; since 1922 it has averaged slightly over 50,000. As regards Australia, if the ratio of British settlers to entrants in the years 1922-27 is applied to the figures of arrivals in the years 1909-13, it will be seen that the average annual number of new British settlers has fallen from about 55,000 in the pre-war years to about 40,000 since 1922.(b) The proportion of foreign migration into these Dominions has increased. From 1909-1913 the Continental migration into Canada averaged about 70,000 annually; since the war it has averaged 55,000 annually, a small decline compared with the decrease of- one-half in British migration. Australia has a much smaller volume of foreign migration, but it has increased since the war and reached a record total in 1927.tfortunate, and should not be glad, to receive into its boundaries many of the men with whom our enquiries have brought us into contact.X. OVERSEA MIGRATION-STATISTICS.89. The white population of the various parts of the Empire of any importance from the point of view of migration from this country in 1921 was : England, Wales and Scotland   ............   42,769,196Canada :Of British origin        ....       ...       ...      4,868,903Of French origin about        ......      2,500,000Of other origin, about ......      1,200,000    ----    8,568,903
91. It is sometimes said that the last three years of the pre-war period were exceptional and must not be taken as a standard. The intervention of the war makes it impossible to test the value of this statement, which may quite as easily be wrong as right; what is certain, however, is that the natural resources of the Dominions have not dwindled in the interval and that the gap between the figures of those years and the post-war average is in any case too wide to be dismissed so summarily, It must be remembered that British migration since 1923 has had the benefit of assistance under the Empire Settlement Act, while there was no such assistance in pre-war years, and that the general decline in migration since the war followed upon a complete cessation of migration, during the war, the natural corollary of which should have been a. corresponding increase subsequently. Moreover, the improvement in the means of communication, including particularly wireless, has brought the distant places of the world into closer contact. Migration overseas no longer involves the same complete separation from home as in the past.92. A serious fall in migration, despite the improvement in means of communication, is by itself an important fact, which we should have- to consider. But when we remember the sparseness of the population of Canada and Australia, the reiterated need of these Dominions for white settlers for the balanced development of their enormous territories and resources, and their expressed prefer-ence for settlers from the Mother Country; and, on the other hand, the drain caused by unemployment upon the resources of our own country, resources wdiich are required, among other things, to guarantee an adequate defence of the Empire, when we remember too, the declarations of successive Imperial Conferences on the im: portance of migration, an importance deemed sufficient to justify the direct intervention of the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the Dominions and the passing of the Empire Settlement Act in 1922, we cannot but regard the present situation of migra-tion as deeply disturbing.XI.   FACILITIES FOR MIGRATION AND CONDITIONS OF ENTRY INTO THE DOMINIONS.93. Migration to the Dominions may be (a) without assistance, (b) with assistance under the Empire Settlement Act.(a) A physically fit British subject who can pay his own fare and has a small sum for landing money can go to the Dominions to take up work subject to the formalities specified in Appen-dices II and III. The fare to Canada is  18 15s. (before the war it was about  6). Allowing for outfit, landing money, expenses on the journey and the sum of money which it is only prudent that all British settlers should possess on arrival overseas, the amount required for settlement in Canada to-day for a single unassisted man or woman is about  40. A man with a fair sized family requires not less than, say,  150.
. The fare to Australia is  37 (before the war it was about  18). Allowing for outfit and necessary landing money, a man or woman proceeding unassisted to Australia requires to be in possession of about  60. A man with a fair sized family requires a sum of about  200.(b) Under the&apos; Empire Settlement Act the British Govern-ment, contributes up to half the cost of assisted migration and settlement. The Act is designed to create a partnership in migration primarily between the British Government and the respective Dominion Governments.The arrangements made with each Dominion differ in so many important respects that it is necessary to consider the conditions separately for Canada, Australia and New Zealand.A.   CANADA. Cost of Passage.94. The assisted passage to Canada costs the migrant  2, plus the money for the railway journey and individual expenses in Canada, the balance of the passage rate being found as to about  9 5s. by the British Government,  3 10si. by the Canadian Government, and  4 by the shipping company. After paying corn-mission, the shipping company receives about  13 15s.. nett per assisted passenger. The Canadian Government equates the con-tribution of the British Government by various: kinds of expenditure in Canada on behalf of British migrants.&apos;*Limitations of Assisted Passages.95. The grant of assisted passages (of which the British Govern-ment bears half the cost) is strictly limited by the Canadian Authorities under powers specified in the Immigration Act, 1924.t* There are certain minor variations in the rates charged to special classes of migrants.t Prohibited classes of immigrants are described as being : &quot; Immigrants to whom money has been given or loaned by any charitable organisation for the purpose of enabling them to qualify for -landing in Canada under this Act, or whose passage to Canada has been paid wholly or in part by a charitable organisation, or out of public moneys, unless it is shown that the authority in writing of the Deputy Minister or, in the case of persons coming from Europe, the authority in writing of the Assistant Superintendent of Immi-gration for Canada in London, has been obtained for the landing in Canada of such persons, and that such authority has been acted upon within a period of sixty days thereafter.&quot; It will be observed that by a literal interpretation of this Section any British subject in receipt of financial assistance toward the cost of the passage  from   British   Government  funds  would  become  a &quot; prohibited migrant&quot; and subject to the consent in each case of the Canadian Govern-ment representative in London.
The,,Canadian Government has exercised these powers so as to admit only boys and men going to work on the land as farm labourers (a proportion are accepted without previous experience), families with - some agricultural experience or aptitude going to take up farms or nominated by private individuals for employ-ment upon farms, and domestic servants of experience. The Canadian Government will not accept migrants who intend to work in industry, whether they be nominated by responsible persons in Canada or not. It has also declined to accept the wives or other direct dependents of men who have gone out to Canada and have established themselves there for some time in other than agricultural callings.Other Schemes under the Empire Settlement Act.96. In addition to the scheme of assisted passages, there are under the Empire Settlement Act special schemes for boys, both direct with the Canadian Government, and also with voluntary organisa-tions. There has also been a scheme of colonisation known as the 3,000 Families Scheme, for the settlement of families On farms of their own.Procedure for an Intending Migrant to Canada.97. We insert in Appendix II a tabular statement of the pro-cedure to be followed by British migrants going into Canada, with and without assistance.B.   AUSTRALIA. * Cost of Passage.98. The assisted passage rate for an adult man or woman is  16 10s. (there are a number of modifications for boys, women going out as domestic servants, who are given free passages, and for families) which may be advanced as a loan repayable by instalments out of wages.Limitations of Assisted Passages.99. Assisted passages (of which half the cost is paid by the British Government) fall into two main groups &quot; nominations &quot; and &quot;requisitions&quot; from Australia. Any responsible person in Australia may nominate a person here for an assisted passage, subject to the approval of the State Government. (Although the machinery of migration into Australia is under the control of the Commonwealth Government, it is the State Governments who decide the numbers and classes of migrants whom they will accept.)* The procedure to be followed by British migrants to Australia, with and without assistance is set out in Appendix III.
These nominations are not restricted to land work but may be, and in fact are, extended to industrial occupations. The nominator accepts the responsibility for finding work for the migrant and the State Government is relieved of all responsibility. If the nominator is approved and the &quot; nominee &quot; is satisfactory, an assisted passage is granted.100. &quot; Requisitions &quot; axe made by the States through the Com-commonwealth Government for various numbers of boys and young men to work on the land. Previous experience of agricultural work is not insisted upon, but a physical standard so severe is exacted as to result in the rejection of a large proportion of applicants. This standard is applied by selection from among a number of appli-cants by the Australian authorities in this country. The ratio of nominations to requisitions over each of the last five years has been as follows : ----	Nominations.	Requisitions.	Total.1923 ......	9,560	15,497	25,0571924 .........	12,062	12,328	24,3901925 .........	13,831	9,624	23,4551926 .........	25,103	8,595	33,6981927 ...	23,272	6,669	29,941It will be observed that direct requisitions have fallen, as nomina-tions increased, and the increase in nominations has thus not pro-duced a proportionate increase in total migration.Other Schemes under the Empire Settlement Act.101. In addition to the assisted passages, there are various special schemes for boys, and a scheme of group settlement in Western Australia.Migration and Settlement Agreement.102. There is further the Migration and Settlement Agreement (commonly referred to as the &quot;  34-million Loan Agreement &quot;), under which the British Government contributes  150,000 (non-recoverable) for every  750,000 of loan moneys raised by the Commonwealth Government and advanced to the States for pur-poses of development. In return, the Commonwealth Government undertakes that the total number of migrants received and settled under the Empire Settlement Act shall, be 450,000 over .a..period of ten years.
0. New .Zealand.103. The ordinary passage rate is the same as that to Australia, but the assisted passage for an. adult is only about  11. Immigra-tion into New Zealand is at present based almost entirely on nomination, which may be for industrial as well as agricultural work.XII.   CHECKS UPON MIGRATION..104. We doubt whether the tendencies illustrated by the figures of migration set out in Appendix I have been fully appreciated either by the public here or in the Dominions. To restore the post-war figures of migration from this country to the average of some years before the war, even for a couple of years, would make an immense difference. It would take us too far afield to examine in detail all the explanations that are given to account for the falling off, and for a short statement of the factors which act as checks, upon migration we must refer to the Annual Report for the year 1927 of the Oversea Settlement Committee* recently issued, which briefly describes the chief explanations usually given. We wish, however, to supplement very shortly what is said in that report about certain of these explanations.105. The first explanation advanced is the general economic condition at home and in the Dominions.  It is frequently maintained, that in normal times, over a decade or two, migration tends to be at its highest when trade is brisk and development is proceeding.   If this explanation were conclusive for all time the trade difficulties that have been experienced at home might account for a reluctance of our own people to move.   But, in fact, trade conditions in the Dominions have by contrast with our own been relatively pros-prosperous, and yet this fact has not attracted an increased migration. Is it, then, the fault of our own people?   The answer is short;i there are many more people applying and ready to apply for assisted passages overseas than the Dominions are prepared to accept.   There is not an agency, official or unofficial, which has not experience and knowledge of many who wish to go, men and families of all types, and who cannot go because they are held to I be ineligible for assistance owing to the conditions laid down by the I Dominion Authorities, and they cannot afford to pay for them-l selves. 8106. This leads us to a second reason assigned for the falling of I in migration, the cost of the passage from this country to the over-l sea dominions. Passage rates of  18 15s. to Canada, of  37 toi Australia or New Zealand, are, after the economic conditions all home of the last few years, prohibitive for large numbers of en-l tirely suitable migrants, especially families, who are anxious til* Cmd. 3088-1928.
113^7r-^-.,-......-.--Trv-.t^-,Tr:.-:.    .....-take their chances, for themselves and their children, in the Over-sea Dominions, but who cannot afford to lock up all their savings in the passage money, leaving nothing to fall back upon when they arrive. We recognise the improvements in the conditions of travel for migrants which the shipping companies have introduced. These are all to the good, but if their cost is so high as to place them outside the reach of many intending migrants, the value of the benefit is considerably reduced. We appreciate also that the general decline in migrant traffic may make a higher rate inevit-able. But this is to argue in a vicious circle. There is, as the shipping companies know, a large potential traffic waiting for a rate it can afford to pay, but no sufficient effort has been made to attract this traffic by a reduction of rates. Quite apart from their interests as carriers of passengers, the shipping companies have a direct interest in the rapid development of the Dominions and in an expansion of trade with the Dominions whose products they also carry. No freedom of movement within the Empire can come at the present rates. Unless, therefore, the shipping companies will make a serious effort to adjust their rates, they must in some measure share the responsibility for the consequences of the present restricted movement.107. A third explanation often put forward is that based on the proposition that an increase of population in the Dominions must depend upon a prior expansion of markets, internal and external, for their products. The economic history of the United States of America during the Nineteenth Century, with unrestricted migra-tion, is a practical commentary on this line of argument, which, moreover, overlooks the fact that every producer is also a consumer, and that if the home population is restricted, so is the home market.108. Another reason of which much is heard in certain quarters is the existence of unemployment in the Dominions. Unerhploy-ment as it faces us to-day is something quite different from anything within the experience of the Dominions, and in any event, we have received, or heard, of no evidence that the unemployed who in Canada may in the winter seek the cities, and who, in times of seasonal slackness of trade, are to be found in the cities of Australia, contain any high proportion of recent immigrants from Great Britain. Nor is there any necessary causal relation between migration and the volume of unemployment. It seems indeed more probable that in such vast countries what unemployment doss occur is -traceable to the inadequacy of the population for a balanced development of the resources of the country.109. There is sometimes given another &quot; explanation &quot; of de-clining migration, that our people are no longer prepared to take the risks inevitable in starting a career in a new country, or to work as hard as the conditions of such a country require, and that they have become in some way softened by the wide scope
of our own social legislation. We find it difficult to be patient before such a suggestion. It is part of the silly parrot cry about our national decadence that arises from our ingrained habit of ironic self-depreciation. The nature of a people is not altered thus abruptly. What we have been for centuries and were in 1914, we are still. There is the same quality, the same endurance, the same cheerful adaptability, the same stirring in the blood of a call to adventure. But through much of the appeal made to our people to settle overseas we miss this call. To hint that we have become deaf to the call because of the elaborate provision in our code of social legislation against the un-foreseen accidents that overtake men in industry is mere nonsense. Few men thinking of settlement overseas make any nice balance of the differing provisions made here and in the Dominions, though when they hear so much emphasis in public upon &quot; unemploy-ment &quot; overseas, they can be pardoned for wondering what will happen to them if they become unemployed and can find no work of which they are capable. What they want to know is what chances a willing and self-dependent man finds overseas and what welcome he will have. So far as psychological factors influence the level of migration, and their influence is profound, it is on the answer from the Dominions to these questions that the decision of many will turn.XIII. ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE TRAINING FOR OVERSEAS.Ministry of Labour Training Centres.110. The British Government contributes half the cost of assisted passages under the Empire Settlement Act. But it is clear from the above account of the working of that Act that the action of the Dominion Governments has largely limited assisted passages (except for persons able to obtain a nomination from friends or relatives in Australia and New Zealand) to agriculturalists. There is no surplus of workers experienced in agriculture in this country. To reduce the difficulty thus created, and in jjarticular to give young unemployed industrial workers in this country who are prepared to go overseas-to work on the land, a certain rudimentary training in agricultural work and thus qualify them for assisted passages, the British Government, entirely at their own cost and outside the Empire Settlement Act, have set up two residential training centres at Brandon in Norfolk and at Claydon in Suffolk, and they are making arrangements to open a third centre in Scotland. At these centres single young unem-ployed men up to the age of 35 are given simple instruction in certain farming operations, including the handling of horses and of implements of patterns used in the Dominions; milking and the care of cattle ; fencing, the clearing of ground and the use of tools.
The centres in East Angiia have recently been enlarged and, iu-cluding tent units opened in May of this year to train migrants; who will sail for Canada during the present summer, the centres, this year will be capable of training about 2,300 men.Further Training Facilities for Men and Families.111. Agricultural courses are provided at the Army Vocational Training Centre at Chisledon for soldiers in their last year of service with the colours who wish to settle on the land overseas after discharge. Training is also given to wives in a limited number of cases. 54 single men and 19 families were sent out to the Dominions during 1927 from the Army Centre.112. There are two other training centres in this country for men intending to go overseas, the Church of Scotland Training Farm near Stirling, with accommodation for 30 men at a time, and a centre recently established by the Hudson&apos;s Bay Company and the Canadian Pacific Railway in Bedfordshire with accommo-dation for 50 men at a time between the ages of 16 and 35. Half the cost of these centres is borne by the British Government under the Empire Settlement Act the remainder by the organisa-tions concerned.Training for Boys.113. Some training centres for boy migrants have been estab-lished by voluntary societies and by private agency. The most important are the Salvation Army Training Farm at Hadleigh in Essex, which deals with some 850 boys per annum; Dr. Cossar&apos;s farm at Craigielinn in Scotland, which deals with 200 boys a year; the Church Army Farm at Hemel Hempstead, Essex, dealing with 100 boys a year ; and a training farm in Staffordshire dealing with 80 boys a year, under the auspices of the Church of England Waifs and Strays Society. Dr. Barnardo&apos;s Homes have established! a reception centre at Liverpool where, by arrangement with local farmers and the Municipal Authority, boys are taught certain-simple farm operations. One-half of the cost of these centres is provided by the British Government under the Empire Settlement, Act.114. With the co-operation of the City Council, and the Local Authorities, together with the Farmers&apos; Union and the Durham and Northumberland Miners&apos; Welfare Association, a training hostel has been opened at Newcastle-on-Tyne. Boys of 14 to 18 years, of age are taught the rudiments of farming, care of animals, etc.,. in local municipal stables, dairies and on farms in the district; The boys are housed centrally and travel daily to their places of instruction. One-half of the cost of borne by the&apos; British Govern-ment, under the Empire Settlement Act, the remainder is found by the Local Authorities, the Miners&apos; Welfare Fund, shipping
XIV. POSSIBILITIES OF INCREASING MIGRATION.116. In Section XI we indicated the restricted scope of the migration that is at present proceeding&quot; under the Empire Settle-ment Act. In Section XII we discussed some factors detrimentally affecting the general movement of migration. We now turn to a consideration of the measures which, in our judgment, would lead to a greater volume of migration.A. Migration within the Empire Settlement Act, 1922.(i) Assisted Passages.&apos; 117. AVithin its limits, this has possibilities if wholeheartedly worked. But it must be remembered that it is in principle a part-nership on equal terms, and in such a relation each side has equal claims to consideration. We do not suggest that our relations with the Dominions should be set down in terms of a balance-sheet, nor should the Dominions forget the financial burdens we bear in other respects, which to a considerable extent relieve their own tax-payers. On this and many other grounds, we are entitled to a I consideration of the effect upon our position of the financial weight of our industrial difficulties.118. In the case of Canada, apart from the important question I of simplifying procedure (paras. 130 and 131), there are two matters which seem to us to require prompt reconsideration.   As we havel already explained, nominations for industrial employment are not I accepted by the Canadian Government.   We are not aware of the I economic   justification   for   this.     It   has   never   been   sug-gested   that   if   the   numbers   of   the   unassisted   migrants,! who,   of   course,   include   men   of   all   classes   and   occupa-tions,   principally   industrial,   were   to   increase   substantially,! Canada would have no room for them or that they would not I become productive members of the community.  Whatever may becompanies and private individuals. The establishment of similar centres is under consideration in a number of towns, notably Liver-pool, Hull, Bristol, and also in South Wales.Training for Women and Girls.115. An experimental centre for training women in domestic work with a view to migration to Australia has recently been estab-lished at Market Harborough. This has an annual output of between 200 and 300 and applicants are forthcoming in satisfactory numbers. The trainees qualify for assisted passages. The cost of the centre is shared between the British and Australian Common-wealth Governments.This is the only scheme of training to which a Dominion Govern-ment makes a financial contribution.
the experience of many of our people for work on the land overseas, of their value for industry there can be no doubt whatever. The wages that they receive if they go to the United States are evidence of this. If additional numbers would add to the general wealth of Canada, why not assist them to come in such numbers, subject to any reasonable standards of health and education that may be necessary to ensure a good type of migrant?119. Secondly, we think that assisted passages should be avail-able for the families of men who have gone to Canada. If a man, anxious for the future of his family, should go out alone and make good as a productive member of the Canadian community, he is now compelled, unless he is working in agriculture, either-to remain separated from them for a long time, or to jeopardise their future by sinking all his savings in the high cost of passage rates. We are unable to understand the explanations that have been put forward from time to time of the attitude of the Canadian Authorities on this matter.120, In the case of Australia, nominations by residents in that country for all classes of work have increased. But simultaneously the State Governments have reduced their own direct requisitions, and at present only New South Wales and Western Australia are requisitioning men for farm work. We cannot believe that the requisitions of 6,669 in 1927 represented the total number of new farm workers required by Australian farmers ; indeed, the evidence before us suggests that there is an unsatisfied demand for men for the farms. It must be remembered that nominations can in general only be obtained if the intending migrant has a friend or relative in Australia-; the man without previous ties with the country depends upon requisitions. An increase in the requisitions, is therefore needed. But this is not all. We doubt whether the Commonwealth and State Governments appreciate how adversely the inclination for migration to Australia has been affected by the frequent and sudden changes in the size or composition of the requisition, by the small variations which are introduced by each State into the scheme for boys, by the alterations of attitude towards such matters as bulk nomination by voluntary societies. No general increase in migration can. occur unless the conditions are intelligible and fixed, the procedure easy, and the policy stable over a period. Especially is this true if the wish to migrate has to be stimulated by publicity. Such a process begins slowly, but gathers momentum and it- is essential that this momentum should not be checked by an unexpected change of policy.121. Practically the whole of the migration to New Zealand is upon the nomination principle. The number of nominations accepted has been seriously curtailed during the past. year and we think that the New Zealand Government should be urged to restore their numbers of nominations as soon as possible.
(ii) Land- Settlement.122. Land settlement is an integral part of the conception of the Empire Settlement Act. It is expensive in proportion to its imme-diate results in the numbers to whom it gives a chance of a new life, and expenditure on it should not be permitted to contract other measures of migration. It is right, however, in our opinion, that it should form the background to any organised and co-opera-tive policy of migration between the British and Dominion Govem-ments. The Dominion Governments are concerned about the development of their primary industry of agriculture which is directly helped by land settlement schemes, and the appeal of migration in this country is much stronger if there is in it an ultimate chance of ownership of land, of self-dependence, in place of employment for wages. If in the case of any of these land settlement schemes for families, the absence of the sums necessary for the passage and for landing money is the only bar to the acceptance of- a family from the depressed areas, we consider that the money required should be advanced.123. Similarly, we attach importance to the recent arrangements by which boys and young men going out to work for wages on farms are encouraged to save their earnings in the knowledge that after a few years, when they have gained sufficient experience to start for themselves, the British and Dominion Governments will add to their savings and thus enable them to buy their own farms.B. Training for Migration Overseas.124. Additional training facilities may be required. In the case of single men, it is clear from the evidence that has reached us authoritatively from Canada and Australia, that the work of the British Government in training industrial workers intensively for a short period in the simple elements of farm work is on sound lines and the Ministry of Labour should be authorised to open new centres when required. It must be remembered that these training schemes, which make a man more likely to receive a long-term engagement, are not only valuable in increasing the numbers eligible for assistance, but also serve to attract additional men by supplying a bridge between industrial employment and work in agriculture. It is easier to persuade men to go overseas to work on the land if they can be offered sufficient training to save them from feeling foolish when they start.125. For married men, the training facilities required are limited by the openings that can be found for the man and his family. But for certain Land Settlement Schemes for families some training may prove desirable. In such a case, and for other families for whom openings can be found, we think that financial
provision should be made to assist in the maintenance of the families while the man is being trained.126. For boys training is less necessary; there are, however, already several voluntary bodies giving training, and there is also the hostel at Newcastle (para. 114) which is an admirable example of local co-operative effort with Government support. We hope that other areas wall adopt the Newcastle scheme and we think that its general outlines should be brought to the notice of influential persons in other parts of the coalfields.127. As regards girls and young women, it is clearly of the greatest importance for the well-being of the Dominions that the numbers going overseas should be increased. We understand that the work of the Market Harborough hostel is successfully helping to increase the number and we hope that further hostels on the same lines will be opened.C. Migration outside the Empire Settlement Act.128. The alteration and extension of the present arrangements under the Empire Settlement Act which we have suggested should go some way to fulfil the purpose of the Act, subject to an import-ant consideration regarding procedure which we develop in paragraphs 130 and 131. But they will be quite inadequate for the needs of the present abnormal situation under which one part of the Empire has a large excess of first-rate human material, and other parts of the Empire are obviously under-populated. In the most favourable circumstances migration under the Empire Settlement Act is likely to be slow and restricted. This result is inevitable from the responsibility assumed by the respective Govern-ments for every step taken under the Act. Migration thus asso-ciated in every particular with the machinery of Government will always be subject to political considerations entailing extreme timidity in administration. Every failure, every accident, is magnified; the hundreds and thousands of successes are passed over in silence. There is indeed, in our judgment, considerable risk that this form of migration is becoming a substitute for natural migration. Stimulated migration under the Empire Settlement Act or otherwise, and operating through Government departments and voluntary migration societies should be regarded as supple-mentary to natural migration. The majority of intending migrants do not demand or need elaborate supervision or help. They want an opportunity to go overseas, under conditions they are able to meet; they want to take&quot;their chance in countries which hold both risks and prospects of success; they want the knowledge that they will receive a welcome, not necessarily from Governments and organised bodies, but from the ordinary men and women among whom they will lead their lives in future. It is indisputable that the Dominions hold these chances, and we cannot doubt that the
British stock in those countries would welcome the advent of their own kith and kin in lieu of foreign immigrants; we are certain that thousands of our people are prepared and anxious to take their chances overseas.129. What are the fundamental conditions for an increase of migration? They are twofold, financial, and psychological. The financial conditions are that the passage rates must be within the reach of the ordinary man (special help may be necessary for certain classes), and that a man should possess the minimum of outfit necessary for a start in a new country and a small sum of money to fall back upon after arrival. It is certain that passage rates must be substantially reduced if real freedom is to come again into the movement of our people within the Empire. For outfit and what we may call &apos;&apos; landing money &apos;&apos; special provision by the Government will be necessary for some men, especially those from the depressed areas, and this should be arranged.130. But even if these financial conditions are satisfied, still more depends upon the procedure adopted by the Dominion Authorities. People cannot be brought to believe that the Dominions seriously want them and would welcome their arrival if they are confronted with what appears to be a formidable tangle of procedure, involving expense, delay and often an embarrassing publicity about their intention to migrate. It does not matter that each item in the procedure may be insignificant; it is the whole picture that is built up out of them that does the harm. &quot;To be chased from pillar to post,&quot; or &quot; to be made a fool of &quot; are two matters on which our people are sensitive ; even if the charge be not true, the impression ought not to be given.131. Many of the present restrictions and formalities have a cumulatively discouraging effect, not only upon those who experi-ence them on application, but upon the far larger number who may be contemplating migration. For a British subject wishing to go overseas the formalities should be reduced to a minimum. We cannot help feeling, for example, that such precautions against the possible entry of an unsatisfactory British migrant, as are detailed in the account of the Canadian Governments system in Appendix II, are to say -the least, excessive. All the controversial talk about migration, all the complications and delays and disappointments, at present attendant upon the schemes of assisted passages under the Empire Settlement Act, have un-doubtedly induced a general mood of doubt and reluctance that may set into a definite unwillingness, to be corrected only after a long time, unless migration can be promptly made cheap and easy. Low passage rates and free movement are a simple test not only of a belief in the importance to the Empire of migration but of the confidence of that Empire in its own future. It is, in fact,   difficult   not   to   wonder   whether   migration   is   not  a
sphere in which Government control and activity can very easily become transformed against the will of its authors into a barrier to free movement and an intervention that is restrictive in opera-tion or in effect. There is, in our judgment, a clear distinction between, on the one hand, such Government intervention as is necessary to secure the avoidance of unnecessary hardship, or, as is required in present circumstances, to give special measures of training and assistance, and, on the other hand, the elaboration;of a code of regulations, whether by the Home or Dominion Govern-ments, which check the impetus of those non-Government agencies that in pre-war days ensured an abundant flow of succcessful migration.There is no part of our proposals in regard to migration that we regard as more important than the steady encouragement of the normal flow of migration through unofficial channels and the need of governmental authority to limit its intervention to what is re-quired to prevent abuse and, to the extent that may be necessary, to provide special assistance.132. It is a corollary of this policy that the normal agencies such as the shipping companies and their repre-sentatives should be encouraged and enabled to attract the traffic. The conditions under which migrants travel have greatly improved since before the war; the facilities, official and unofficial, which are available to them overseas, for help and advice, are much more extensive, the risk that belonged to what are called &quot; the old pioneering days &quot; have been much reduced by the wider development of the Dominions. And if we are told that cheap passages and simple procedure would not ensure in every case rapid and certain success in the Dominions, we would ask our critics to compare the prospects overseas for a willing man with the prospects that at present confront so many of our people, however willing, in this country. If in the face of this they dis-courage migration to the Dominions, they take upon themselves a great responsibility.133. We take it, of course, for granted that any increase in migration outside the provisions of the Empire Settlement Act would not be used as an argument for reducing the numbers accepted by the Dominions under that Act. Such an attitude would be wholly inconsistent with the declarations of the Dominions, the conclusions of Imperial Conferences and the avowed purpose of the Empire Settlement Act itself. The British Government for its part has shown itself to be in earnest in its policy of migration; that is known to the Governments and people of the Dominions. We trust that there is a growing recognition in the Dominions of the vital importance to the better health and balance of the Empire of a greater and more varied flow of British migration. The Do-minions have in this country their own representatives from whom
we have received courteous assistance, and we feel assured of their co-operation with the British Authorities in facilitating the much, more extensive movements which we hope all the Governments, concerned will henceforth encourage.XV. CREATION OF ARTIFICIAL EMPLOYMENT.134. We have described above measures than can lead to a natural transfer of population to ordinary work either in this country or overseas. It is admittedly a gradual process, though it: can be hastened as we have suggested. But it is the only process which can be made comprehensive or permanent in its effects. As, however, it is not spectacular, it is suggested in some quarters that there is an obligation on the State to intervene more directly, so as to increase the total volume of employment available, either by embarking on schemes of public works, financed mainly, if not wholly, by the Exchequer, or by administering a tonic, in the form of easy credit, to industrial development generally, and so accelerat-ing the pace at which the absorption of workpeople can proceed. Such suggestions are usually supported by the argument that there is a lot of work which needs to be done, and which, when done, will add to the amenities, or to the competitive efficiency of the country, and that there is lying idle a reserve of labour power which could be profitably used in the work.135. We have felt bound to have regard to the settled financial policy of the country, and we have, therefore, treated as outside our province ambitious financial proposals however ingenious, if, as is the case with most, they involve a departure from existing principles of tariff or currency and credit policy and would raise prolonged and acrimonious controversy.136. There is, howrever, another category of proposals not open, on the face of them, to this objection, and directed towards the development of internal resources on lines that have already been accepted. They range from such schemes as slum clearance, trunk road reconstruction, land drainage and reclamation, down to mere expedients for giving unemployed men something to do, such as levelling slag heaps. Every Department of State knows of such schemes, and we have not thought it necessary to call for evidence upon them from outside sources.137. Such proposals involve for the most part merely J the creation by the State of a temporary, artificial and substitute employment market. And that they may, in certain cases, produce assets of lasting value, is no answer to this criticism,! for there are many ways of increasing the capital value of thej country&apos;s resources, if money is available. If it is to be assumed! that unlimited money is to be used, who is to judge, in relation to I
our problem,- between expenditure for the benefit of private indus-tries, on the reconstruction of much of the plant in the iron and steel industry, for example, or the extension of facilities for the better utilisation of coal, or the restoration to cultivation-value of water-logged farm land, or the construction of main arterial roads?138. There is a further practical difficulty. Nearly all of the schemes suggested touch the financial relations between the Ex-chequer and Local Authorities. It is obvious that no scheme can be considered which involves further heavy financial liabilities for the Local Authorities in the depressed areas. The proposals in the current Budget recognise the need for relief from the burdens of local taxation which are hampering productive industry and so retarding the absorption of workpeople into industry. If, there-fore, such schemes are to be carried out, the Exchequer must.bear either the whole cost, or at least a much higher proportion than has hitherto been granted to services still within the responsibility of Local Authorities.139. As instances of the cost involved we may say that it has been estimated that to give 1,350 unskilled men work on trunk road reconstruction for one year would cost one million pounds.. On land drainage, for the same sum, about 1,000 unskilled men could be employed for two to three years.140. These figures make it clear that any attempt by the State to provide for the problem before us by the creation of a substitute employment market, on a scale sufficient to have any effect at all, would be prohibitive in cost. The sums involved would raise most serious questions of financial policy in relation to taxation and the position of the State&apos;s credit.141. We have reached the conclusioir, therefore, that it is impracticable to look to such schemes for any effective contribution and that undue emphasis on their possibilities only serves to distract attention from the true difficulties of the situation and from the unheroic and actual possibilities of solution.142. We reach this conclusion with some reluctance. But when we consider that since the Armistice under the varied and comprehensive programmes of works in relief of un-employment (not including Trade Facilities guaranteed schemes) works of the total estimated value of slightly under -  190 millions have been approved, and that, notwithstanding the magnitude of the undertakings, there have been at no one date more than 75,000 men employed on such works and of these many for short spells only, amd that we have still to face a heavy volume of unemployment, we believe it would clearly be contrary to public policy to begin another cycle of such works. Begun under the conditions of&apos; to-day, they would be, in plain fact, relief works. A programme of relief works would, in our judgment, ignore the realities of the present situation.
;       .    XVI. CONCLUSION.143. There are upwards of 200,000 workmen of all ages, many of whom are married, who cannot expect to earn a livelihood from the industries in which they have hitherto been employed. Only for a few of them can we discern any real prospect of regular employment in their own neighbourhood.To gain once more a livelihood from work, they will need to move. The majority of them can be absorbed into industry in the ordinary process of the employment market if the industrial community will make up its mind to give them an opportunity. For the younger men there are chances in the oversea Dominions which can be made open to much larger numbers : the boys have prospects which can be realised with a small effort; the older and married men will need more conscious help. It is a hard thing to tell numbers of men and even whole communities that unless they leave all their familiar surroundings they will not be able to earn a- laving, but we should be shirking every inference from the facts if we did not emphasise this as the first and strongest of the lessons that our work has provided. The second lesson is, however, not less important. That if men are willing to move there are possibilities of help. For this we look, as indeed we must, to the quickened imagination and practical sym-pathy of the whole community, to the steady accumulation of small offers of help, and to a firm decision to take advantage of every chance. And our belief in the character of our fellow countrymen leads us to look for this with confidence.SUMMARY.1. In certain of the heavy industries, and particularly in coal mining, there exists a definite surplus of labour over and above the requirements of the industries. The resulting unemployment, involving probably upwards of 200,000 workers (many with de-pendants), constitutes a tragic problem, necessitating the urgent and sympathetic attention of the entire country.2. This unemployment is of a special character; it is concen-trated in areas where almost the whole community has depended on one or two industries, and whole communities therefore an involved in the slow paralysis it brings with it. It is not suscep-tible of solution by localised measures of relief. It is no longei a question of tiding over the unemployment in these areas until the crisis passes. A new policy is needed, directed to the permanent removal of as many workers as possible away from the depressed industries and areas to other areas where the prospect of employ ment notwithstanding a certain amount of unemployment-is more favourable.
3. Such a policy can only be effective through the united efforts of everyone. Governmental action by itself cannot solve the problem. Success depends first upon the realisation by unemployed persons themselves of the stark realities of the situation and upon their resolution to try a fresh start elsewhere; secondly, upon the co-operation of the public employers, workpeople, private persons of all descriptions and every agency, official and unofficial to foster opportunities for employment and to ease the way of transfer ; and, thirdly, and lastly, upon State help.4. Transfer must be, so far as possible, a natural process and lead to permanent absorption. Within this country it must ulli rnately rest upon natural economic development, Overseas, owing to the self-evident need of the Dominions for a greater population to develop their resources, there are chances of absorption for large numbers of productive workers.5. The elasticity of the employment market makes practicable the absorption in ordinary industry of a large part of the surplus without permanent prejudice to other workers. But this implies that every section of the community, both as a human duty and as an act of wise policy, makes itself responsible for allowing every chance of employment to these workpeople from the depressed areas. First-rate human material is available; realisation of the facts and goodwill to turn them to account are requisite; and for a practical application of this goodwill particularly in respect of the older men we appeal to all.6. The first business of the Stats is to ensure free play for the forces making for transfer. It has provided in the employment ex-changes a system for linking up throughout the country employers and workmen, and the fullest use of this by both parties is of paramount importance.Further, if workpeople who have found employment in another area cannot afford to pay for the cost of removal, or the cost of transferring their families, or the cost of separately maintaining their families in the interval before they can be transferred, or if they lack means while they are waiting for the first payment of wages, they should be helped.Similarly, if the younger men and juveniles can improve their chances of absorption by training, they should be trained.7. For some of the older men with families there are opportunities -ties of settlement on the land in this country in connection with afforestation. The fullest possible advantage should be taken of these opportunities and the number of holdings available should be rapidly increased.8. As regards oversea settlement, it is a matter of regret, and indeed, astonishment, to find how disappointingly slow has been the rate of settlement of British people in Australia and Canada, notwithstanding the passing in 1922 of the Empire Settlement. Act
for the express purpose of stimulating it. These two countries, although each comparable in size to the United States of America, have populations comparable merely to that of London. Even if it were the case and it is obviously not so that Australia and Canada had reached the limit of their absorptive power, it is still to be noted that in 1927 82,000 Continental Europeans settled in Canada. In the same year approximately 22,000 non-British persons arrived in Australia.9. At successive Imperial Conferences, the Dominions and the Mother Country have agreed on the importance of Empire Settls-ment. It remains to put that policy into really effective force. Not only will this bring a direct cumulative gain to the Dominions; it will also go far towards a solution of the special problem con-fronting us.10. Migration procedure is highly complicated, and formalities are numerous and restrictive. We are satisfied that they con-stitute a real discouragement to potential settlers. Nothing can be more vital or urgent than the need for a radical simplification of all this.11. Further to facilitate settlement apart from the Empire Settlement Act there should be a reduction of the passage rates more nearly to the pre-war level. Something more than this is also needed in the present abnormal conditions here. Even with lower passage rates there are men who would be quite unable to find the money necessary for their ticket, clothes, and funds on landing.   Such needs ought to be met during the next few years.12. If action on the lines of our report be taken promptly and pressed resolutely, the problem, grave and stubborn though it is, will not be found incapable of solution. But no single line of advance must be ignored. Only by concerted movement alike within our shores and within the Empire can the desired objective be attained.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants,. (Signed.)   N. F. WARREN FISHER.
