[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]/jjpf      2 1      (28)J)*J circulated to the; Cabinet by direction of the&amp; Secretary of State for Foreign, Affairs,MEMORANDUM.Draft Treaty for the Renunciation of War, with particular reference to the Question of the &quot; Special Regions &quot; mentioned in Paragraph 10 of the British Note of May 19,1928.Absence of reference in neiv United States Note to Paragraph 10 of British Note of May 19,IN paragraph 10 of the British note of the 19th May, 1928 (Appendix 1), His Majesty&apos;s Government reminded the United States Government that there were &quot; certain regions of the world the welfare and integrity of which constitute a special and vital interest for our peace and safety,&quot; adding that the protection of these regions against attack &quot; is to the British Empire a measure of self-defence.&quot; The paragraph proceeds to say that &quot; it must be clearly understood that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain accept the new treaty upon the distinct understanding that it does not prejudice their freedom of action in this respect.&quot;The absence from the new American note (Appendix 2) of any specific reference to this paragraph of the British note may be taken to mean that the United States Government are content that this declaration should remain unchallenged. Furthermore, it will be observed that in the antepenultimate paragraph of the United States note the hope is expressed that His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;will be able promptly to indicate their readiness to accept, without qualification or reservation, the form of treaty suggested by the United States.&quot; This request, coupled with the absence of any specific reference to paragraph 10 of the British note, seems to hint at an expectation on the part of the United States Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government will rest content with paragraph 10 of the note of the 19th May and will not consider it necessary or desirable to make any specific declaration in regard to these points at the moment of signature. It is true that in talking to the press on the 20th May last the State Department declared that they were opposed to any reference to these &quot; special regions &quot; in the treaty itself, and assumed that the point would be met by means of a unilateral declaration to be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government at the time of signature. But opinion in the United States appears since then to have hardened against any declaration of the kind being attached to the treaty itself. It is, indeed, clear that such a declaration on our part might inspire other Powers to make similar declarations. The United States Government, for their part, have no intention whatever of making a reservation on this or any other point, and the reservation of every &quot;Monroe doctrine,&quot; with the exception of the American Monroe doctrine, would place the United States Government in an embarrassing position with their own public.The probabilities are, therefore, that a unilateral declaration on this point by His Majesty&apos;s Government would now meet with opposition in the United States.4498 [17862] ti
2If we should wish to rely on paragraph 10 of the note of the 19th May as an unchallenged record of our special interests in certain regions, it would be necessary that its substance should have been communicated to all the signatory Powers and not merely to the United States Government as at present.Implications of the latest Draft of the Treaty.Before examining in detail the question whether any further reservation or unilateral declaration will be necessary to safe-guard our position in the &quot; special regions,&quot; it may be well first to summarise the provisions of the latest draft treaty and to examine its implications in the light of the United States note of the 23rd dune.The signatory Powers &quot; renounce war as an instrument of national policy in their relations ivith one another &quot; and agree that the settlement of all disputes &quot; shall never be sought except by pacific means.&quot; All signatories of the Locarno Treaty have been invited to become original parties to the new treaty, and Mr. Kellogg claims that by this means all possibility of a conflict of obligations between the Locarno Treaty and the Peace Treaty will be avoided. Mr. Kellogg is further willing to invite all the Powers with which France has signed treaties of neutrality to become original parties&apos;to the new treaty, thus similarly safe-guarding these particular treaties. The right of self-defence is recognised by Mr. Kellogg to be inalienable and inherent in every sovereign State and no specific reference to this right in the treaty is held to be desirable.So far it is probable that the United States Government are on common ground with both His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government, but it is when the new text of the preamble conies to be examined that possible divergences of view and of interpretation are discovered.Mr. Kellogg had promised that the new text of the preamble wOuld take account of two of the main desiderata of the French and British Governments, namely : (1) Maintenance of existing treaties, and (2) freedom of action for all signatory Powers against a Power breaking the treaty. Even if it be admitted that the Locarno and neutrality treaties are in the main safe-guarded by participation of all the signatories of those treaties as original parties to the new treaty, there remains the League Covenant (article 16 of which provides for warlike measures against a Covenant-breaking State which may not be a party to the new treaty) and the Treatv of Versailles (article 44 of which declares the violation by Germany of the demilitarised zone to be a &quot; hostile act &quot; and &quot; calculated to disturb peace.&quot;)Mr. Kellogg appai^ently seeks : (1) to overcome the difficulty about the League; (2) to give signatory Powers freedom of action against a treaty-breaker; and (3) to give some comfort to Powers having &quot; special regions &quot; in which they desire to see the status quo maintained at all costs by the terms of paragraph 3 of the new preamble.The first part of this preamble reads as follows : &quot;Convinced that all changes in their relations with one-another should be sought only by pacific means and be the result of a peaceful and orderly process.&quot;This -clause.may prove useful to us in our relations, for instance, with Egypt. Should Egypt sign the treaty she would be unable, without breaking it, to attempt to modify her existing relationship with this country by any process which was not &quot; peaceful and orderly.&quot; It is unlikely that any United States Government could be induced to approach more closely than this to a guarantee of the status quo.The second part of this paragraph reads as follows : (Con-vinced) &quot;that any signatory Power which shall hereafter seek to
promote its national interests by resort to war should be denied the benefits furnished, by this treaty.&quot; ;  .   ,The above sentence is capable, of two interpretations-the wider one that resort to war with any Power,-whether signatory or non-signatory, is intended, and the narrower interpretation,-that resort to war against another signatory only would lead to the benefits of the treaty being forfeited.The effect of the wider interpretation can briefly be, summarised as follows: It (a) allows us, without losing the benefits of the: treaty, to take warlike action, under article 16 against a signatory who has.attacked a non-signatory member of the League, and (b) allows us, without losing the: benefits of the treaty, to defend any country in which we have special interests (not being a signatory) against attack by a signatory. It is not clear that it (c) allows us to defend such countries against attack by a non-signatory, since no signatory would have-gone to war before we did. It might also involve losing the benefits of the treaty if we (d) assisted a Power which had, without violating the Kellogg treaty, gone to war under the &quot;gap in the Covenant&quot; or (e) intervened in a war between two non-signatory and non-League Powers. It would (/) only allow us to take warlike action under article 16 against a non-signatory if such action were not regarded as &quot; seeking to promote our national interests by resort to war.&quot;        . , ,The narrower. interpretation on the other hand would not cover either point (a) or point (&amp;), but it does cover (c), (d), (e) and (/).    . &apos;For the purposes of this memorandum it will be simpler to assume that some form of words will ultimately be found which will take full account of the obligations of members of the League of Nations, with particular reference to article 16 of the&quot; Covenant. It therefore only appears necessary here to examine the effects of points (6), (c) and (e) on our position in the countries in which we have special interests, i.e., Egypt, Persia, Nejd, the Hejaz, Iraq and. Afghanistan. The wider interpretation would permit Great Britain to defend any of the above countries (whether signatories or not) against attack by a signatory Power though possibly not against a non-signatory Power. Under the same interpretation His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment might find themselves debarred from going to the aid of say Afghanistan, if attacked by Russia, or Iraq, if attacked by the Hejaz (all being presumed to be non-signatory and non-League Powers).The narrower interpretation on the other hand would permit us to defend any of the.&quot; special region&quot; countries against attack by a non-signatory but not against attack by a signatory. The narrower interpretation would also permit His Majesty&apos;s Government ,to intervene in the event of an attack by Russia upon Afghanistan or by the Hejaz upon Iraq (all being presumed to be non-signatory and nonr-League Powers).It will be seen that, from the point of view of our own interests in &quot; special regions,&quot; neither interpretation can be looked upon as wholly satisfactory. The difficulty of the problem is increased by the absence of any present indication as-to which of the &quot;special region&quot; countries (with the exception of Egypt) is likely to become a party to the treaty and what is the probable attitude of the Russian Government towards it.There is, however, nothing in the text of the treaty which prevents a signatory Power from adopting such &quot;police&quot;, measures as may be necessary to protect the liyes and property of its nationals abroad, where such steps can be taken short of action which the other state is entitled to treat as a resort to war. It is on such &quot; police &quot; and purely protective measures and generally on their diplomatic influence and prestige, that the [17862] b 2
Great Powers will, if the treaty is signed, have to depend in-order to maintain their position in regions Where they have&apos; special and vital interests-the United States in Nicaragua and Panama, the Japanese in Manchuria, the Italians in Albania, the French in Siam, and the British Empire in Egypt, afghanistan-stan, Persia and the regions contiguous to the Persian Gulf. So far as we know at present the Japanese Government have no intention of making any special reservation, when signing the treaty, on the subject of-Japan&apos;s special interests in Manchuria following in this the example set by the United States.It is now proposed to i examine the probable effect of the proposed treaty on&apos;our relations with Egypt, the Persian Gulf countries, Afghanistan, China, and finally with Russia.(a.) Egypt. -The effect of the proposed treaty on our relations with Egypt becomes more readily apparent if we dispose first of the question whether or not Egypt is to be permitted to accede to that instrument. When paragraph 10 of the Secretary of State&apos;s note of the 19th May was drafted, there. was some reason to think (a) that the United States might herself wish to make a - reservation safeguarding her Monroe doctrine, and (&amp;) that it might be possible to create a kind of panel of States (including Egypt) which would be ineligible to sign the treaty. It is now certain that neither contingency will be realised, and an exami-nation of the problem therefore can only proceed usefully upon this basis.By what other means could Egypt be prevented from acceding to the treaty? In the case of the Covenant there is a recognised procedure for offering objections to the admittance of new members to the League of Nations. This will not be the case with the new treaty. The only methods by which Egypt&apos;s accession could be prevented would be (1) by inviting the other original signatories to agree to a &quot;protooole de signature&quot; expressly excluding Egypt; or (2) by making a unilateral declara-tion that the British signature is appended only on the condition that Egypt is not invited to accede.Neither method is practicable. Such a protocol would never be agreed to by the signatory Powers, to say nothing of the Dominions. Even if agreed to by the Governments, it would never pass the United States Senate. The unilateral declaration, on the other hand, might well prove ineffective, in which case we should be faced with the objectionable alternatives of either accepting the inevitable accession of&quot;Egypt or of withdrawing from the treaty. To make the effort to exclude Egypt and to fail would be disastrous in the extreme. Moreover, opposition to Egypfs accession would place His Majesty&apos;s Government in the illogical position of declaring in substance that, while they regard the defence of Egypt as their special concern, yet they intend to deny to Egypt the right to avail herself of this very latest safeguard against foreign aggression. In the light of these considerations, the case against attempting to exclude Egypt seems so overwhelming that the following observations are based on the assumption that exclusion will not be attempted. The present indications are that Egypt herself is very anxious to participate. It is realised that her participation may render it more difficult for us to refuse an application by her to join the League of Nations.In our relations with Egypt there are two distinct types of risks to be guarded against: (a) an attack upon Egypt by a third Power; and (b) a direct or indirect attempt (by the Egyptians themselves or by a foreign Power, or by. both in collusion) to undermine the British position in Egypt,  If Egypt
signs the treaty, risk (a) will toe diminished, since all-or most-of the Powers of the world will probably have undertaken not to attack her. Should any signatory, fail to keep its undertaking, our hands would be automatically freed to deal with the offender precisely as we should have done before the signature of the treaty. &apos;. - &apos; ;Risk (&amp;) may be slightly increased as a result of Egypfs signature of the treaty, though possibly less so than would appear to be the case at first sight. Any attempt by Egypt to modify her relations with the British Empire by force of arms would be a breach of the treaty. Egypt being thereafter denied, under section 3 of the preamble, &quot; the benefits furnished by the treaty,&quot; our right to protect the lives, and property of our nationals in Egypt would remain unimpaired. If any measures were taken which could justifiably be held to be a menace to our naval and military forces in Egypt or Egyptian waters, we should (subject to any question which might be raised as to our right to have forces in Egypt at all) have a perfect right to send any necessary reinforcements. In fact, the only restriction imposed by the treaty upon our &quot; police &quot; measures in Egypt would be that we should have to remain strictly on the defensive-unless and until Egypt had herself violated the treaty.Subversive propaganda, encouraged or connived at by the Egyptian Government of the day, imprudent legislation such as the recent Assemblies Bill, deliberate weakening of or inter-ference with the police or administrative services or other developments which only constitute an indirect threat to life and property may, after the signature of the treaty by Egypt, have to be dealt with by methods other than the despatch of an ultimatum followed by warships. But the signature and coming into force of the Kellogg treaty will not annul or qualify the communication which His Majesty&apos;s Government caused to be addressed to the Governments of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Prance, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, the United States and other countries in March 1922, defining the special relations between Great Britain and Egypt. The following are the relevant paragraphs of the 1922 note (Appendix 3) : &quot; The termination of the British protectorate over Egypt involves, however, no change in the status quo as regards the position of other Powers in Egypt itself.&quot; The welfare and integrity of Egypt are necessary to the peace and safety of the British Empire, which will therefore always maintain as an essential British interest the special relations between itself and Egypt long recog-nised by other Governments. These special relations are defined in the declaration recognising Egypt as an inde-pendent sovereign State. His Majesty&apos;s Government have laid them down as matters in which the rights and interests of the British Empire are vitally involved, and will not admit them to be questioned or discussed by any other Power. In pursuance of this principle, they will regard as an unfriendly act any attempt at interference in the affairs of Egypt by another Power, and they will consider any aggression against the territory of Egypt as an act to be repelled with all the means at their command.&quot;Suppose that in their desire to get rid of us the Egyptian Government were to invite another Power to occupy Egypt. It cannot be denied that the conclusion of the Kellogg treaty, if the Power in question and Egypt were parties to it, would render it more difficult for us to employ warlike measures to deal with the situation. But if such  a Power had landed troops in Egypt when it was a
British Protectorate, even in pursuance of a request from the Egyptian Government, it would have been, an act of war.   The 1922 note gives notice to the world that the termination of the Protectorate involves &quot;no change in the  status quo as regards the position of other Powers in Egypt itself.&quot;    His Majesty&apos;s Government will not admit our special relations with Egypt &quot;to be: questioned or discussed by any other Power.&quot; &quot; Any attempt at interference &quot;is to be regarded as an unfriendly act.    Any of the passages quoted are likely to&apos; bid a foreign Power pause before intervening in Egypt at the request of the Egyptian Government, especially when it is remembered&apos; that British troops are r already and have been for nearly fifty years on the spot.    The intervention  of  armed  foreign forces in defiance of the 1922 note and of the serious diplomatic repre-sentations which His Majesty&apos;s Government would make at the first sign that such a move was in contemplation, would be utterly inconsistent with  the  principle  that all changes in the relations of the signatory Powers with one another should be sought only by pacific means and be the result of a peaceful and orderly process.   In the case of an attempt at such inter-vention it should not be impossible to maintain with success that the other Power had committed an act of aggression, and that if war resulted in consequence it was on our side a war of self-defence.  The United Statesand Japan,with theirown Monroe doctrines, could be relied upon to support any such reasonable interpretation of the meaning of the note of March 1922.   In the present world situation, indeed, all the Great Powers are likely in practice to leave strictly to us the interpretation of the new treaty so far as our relations with Egypt are concerned.In the light of the foregoing considerations it appears legitimate to conclude that so far as Egypt is concerned the dangers-inherent in our present relationship with that country will be increased rather in theory than in practice by the coming into force of the Kellogg treaty. It is theoretically possible that, relying on British regard for the strict observance of the under-taking to renounce war as an instrument of national policy, a foreign Government in collusion with an anti-British Egyptian Government might push their disregard for the warning conveyed in .1922 further than they would be prepared to do in the absence of such a treaty. As against this it must be remembered that, were a foreign Power to disregard our 1922 warning, we could not under the League Covenant have recourse to hostilities to enforce respect for it without reference of the whole dispute to Geneva and perhaps to The Hague. That is the position to-day and the Kellogg treaty seems unlikely to make it more embarrassing from our point of view.It has been suggested that some form of unilateral reference by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the 1922 warning at the moment of signing the Kellogg treaty to indicate that our signature did not invalidate the former instrument might strengthen our position. This may be the case but there are grave objections to any such unilateral declaration or reservation. In the first place it is bound to give offence in Egypt : this is particularly undesirable now that a moderate and not unfriendly Government, which will require our support, is in office. In the second place if a reservation regarding Egypt is made but nothing is said about the Persian Gulf or Afghanistan, it would create the impression that we no longer claim any special interests in. those countries. On tli8 other hand it is arguable that if our special interests in those countries were to be mentioned in any reservation, the offence given, would be out of all proportion to the advantage gained by their inclusion (see below). - ; . ... .      . .
(b:) Regions contiguous to the Persian Gulf.The problem with respect to British vital interests in these regions is much more complicated than in the case of Egypt. In  the  first place, several countries  and rulers, of  various degrees of independence, are concerned; Persia and Nejd, which are &apos; wholly  independent ;   Iraq, which  is  in   special  quasi-mandatory relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government  but is nominally independent; the Trucial Chiefs, Koweit, Bahrein, &amp;c., who are hi special treaty relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government approximating to a British Protectorate.   There is, moreover, no single, comprehensive or up-to-date document, like the 1922 notification concerning Egypt, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government could refer in the proposed declaration as a means of reserving and defining their position in the Gulf.   The nearest approach to such a document was Lord Lansdowne&apos;s statement in the House of Lords in 1903 that &quot;we should regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace tc British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal.&quot;   But this statement was never formally communicated to foreign Governments like the notification coii-cerning Egypt; and since it was made, twenty-five years ago, conditions have changed greatly in consequence of the collapse of the Turkish Empire; the creation of a quasi-independent Iraq under British supervision; the rise of a single independent ruler Ibn Saud over  the greater part of Arabia from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea, including the Holy Places of Islam ; and the establishment of a strongly Nationalist regime in Persia, which has abolished the Capitulations and seems determined to rid itself of everything which it considers derogatory to its independence and sovereignty, such as the privileges hitherto enjoyed by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India on Persian territory and in Persian waters, but never specifically authorised by the Persian Government, e.g., wireless and coaling stations.   In view of all these changes, and of the discussions which are to take place with the Persians when His Majesty&apos;s Minister returns to Tehran in the autumn, the time&apos; has clearly come when His Majesty&apos;s Government must reconsider and redefine their real desiderata in the Gulf and the means which they possess for securing them, bearing in mind not only the national susceptibilities of the Persians and Ibn Saud and the importance of maintaining good relations with them, but also the responsibilities of His Majesty&apos;s Government in con-nexion with Iraq both to the Iraqis themselves and to the League of Nations.This process will involve a consideration of problems which are of importance to the Government of India, to the Colonial Office as regards Iraq and Ibn Saud, and to the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry as regards naval and military requirements, the maintenance of Imperial communications, &amp;c.; and pending the examination of the question from these points of view and the definition of a general policy, it is difficult for the Foreign Office to advise as regards the necessity for a reference to the Persian Gulf in the proposed declaration to accompany British signature of the treaty for renunciation of war or the form in which such a reference could be couched. All we can say at present is that difficult negotiations still lie ahead of us with Ibn Saud over frontier troubles between Nejd and Iraq, and with the Persians over Gulf questions generally; that it is most desirable, with a view to preserving peace in the Middle East, to reach friendly settlements with those two parties ; and that the chances of achieving this purpose would be gravely imperilled by a public British declaration which seemed to imply the proclamation of anything like a British
protectorate over Persian or Nejdian territory. It is, however, recognised that the importance of retaining some freedom of action in the Persian Gulf may prove to be so great on naval, military and Imperial grounds, that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot pass the question over in silence in the event of any declaration being made in regard to their special rights in respect of Egypt, since such action might convey the impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared henceforth to disinterest themselves in Gulf questions. This is, perhaps, an added reason for making no special declaration respecting Egypt.The prospect of the Persians or Ibn Saud acceding to the treaty for renunciation of war, if invited to do so, is doubtful. The Persians are generally disinclined to accede to treaties in which they are not included as original signatories; and it may be expected that a multilateral treaty of the kind proposed would offer little attraction to them as regards their security, since they have already made non-aggression pacts with three of their neighbours (Russia, Turkey and Afghanistan), and will feel quite secure as regards the other two -Iraq and India so long as they keep on good terms with His Majesty&apos;s Government. Ibn Saud also has little inducement to join in a world-wide anti-war treaty since the only foreign Powers with whom he comes into direct contact are His Majesty&apos;s Government qua Iraq, Transjordan, the Trucial Chiefs, &amp;c, and the Italians qua their relations with his south-western neighbour, the Imam of the Yemen.(c.) Afghanistan.A public declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government about Afghanistan would raise very serious difficulties. This delicate question was carefully considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence recently, and the formula suggested by them was : &quot; That Britain could never regard with indifference the interference by a foreign Power in the existing territory of a friendly Afghanistan, but that the exact steps which ought, in that event, to be taken must depend upon the circum-stances of the moment.&quot;This formula has not, of course, been communicated to the Afghan Government; it merely serves to show how far we are prepared to go. But even so cautious a declaration as this would assume a very different significance if it were attached to the new treaty instead of being merely communicated by us to the Afghan Government in private. By giving such a declaration world-wide publicity we should run the risk of (a) offending Afghan susceptibilities, and (&amp;) encouraging them to count on our support against Russia in any circumstances.The views of the India Office are in this matter indispensable-sable.(d.) Far East.Although no part of the Par East can properly be considered as falling within the &quot; special regions &quot; mentioned in paragraph 10 of the note of the 19th May, it may. be well to consider briefly the effects of the treaty on our policy towards China.No special declaration appears to be necessary so far as China is concerned. The essence of our policy in China is to restrict our action to the defence of British or other foreign lives and property, and the measures taken there seem to conform precisely to the type of &quot; police &quot;or &quot; defensive&quot; measure with which the treaty does not seek to interfere. .Suggestions have, however, been made from time to time that His Majesty&apos;s Government should depart from.; a purely
defensive role in China in order tp exert greater pressure on this or that faction. The type ;of measure suggested has been the blockading of Canton as a means of breaking the boycott against British goods. &quot; Blockade &quot;is so essentially an act of war that its imposition in such, circumstances 1 would appear to be contrary to the proposed treaty unless it could be shown (which seems doubtful) that a blockade was the only or the most effective way of protecting British lives and property in imminent danger, of destruction.Generally speaking, however, measures taken by&quot; one Great Power against a chronically disturbed area, such as China, for the protection of its recognised interests are unlikely to be too closely scrutinised. Nor does , it seem probable that such measures would be lightly stigmatised as breaches of the Renunciation of War treaty by other Great Powers Which may at any moment be compelled themselves to take identical measures in their own defence.(e.) Russia.Paragraph 11 of the note of May 19 (Appendix 1) dealing with the position of Powers not universally recognised, was primarily aimed at Russia and was drafted on the assumption that the United States would be as anxious as we were to keep Russia out of the treaty. This assumption has proved to be incorrect and, so far as is known here, the idea of excluding certain States has not met with support in any quarter outside this country. His Majesty&apos;s Government would no doubt not wish to press the point if they found themselves alone in their desire to exclude Russia..It is, moreover, open to question whether British interests would suffer greatly from the signature of the treaty by Russia. The argument has been advanced that it is only through the threat or prospect of war that Russian subversive propaganda in the British Empire can be kept even within its present bounds. But it is open to doubt whether the prospect of war . is, in fact, so great a deterrent as the prospect of economic and financial ostracism. To be fully effective economic pressure must of course be universal, and of this the Russians have no fear in present circumstances. Joint Anglo-American action in this sense would, however, be second only to universal economic pressure in its disastrous effects on the Russian body politic and is a, bogey which may well be present to the mind of the Soviet leaders. We know that in present circumstances such Anglo-American co-operation is not practical politics, but the renunciation-tion of War Treaty is a door through which we may advance towards protective co-operation when British and American security are alike threatened by treasonable and subversive action on the part of the Soviet. Many leaders of American thought are now not unreceptive to the idea of joint economic co-operation against a recalcitrant State as a substitute for individual pressure by war, and this idea may gradually assume a sufficiently concrete form to constitute a deterrent at least as effective as the threat of war.A further point perhaps worth considering is that the main lever which the Soviets use in fomenting anti-British sentiment among the Russian masses appears to be the fiction that the Imperialist British Empire is constantly planning an unprovoked assault upon their harmless and ill-protected country. This appears to be a stock-in-trade of all supporters of a large Red army. If both the Empire and Russia were to sign the proposed treaty, it would be a little difficult even for the sophists of Moscow to make much further use of that particular argument. [17862] .      .     c    ,
It seems improbable, therefore, that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment will wish, unsupported by other Powers, to press for a reservation which will cut at the very root of the treaty.Conclusion.It now seems probable that any unilateral declaration, at the time of signature, relating to our position in Egypt and the Persian Gulf would provoke considerable opposition in the United States and might well create difficulties in the United States Senate. For the reasons given above, however, any special declaration in regard to Egypt would appear to be unnecessary provided that our 1922 communication and the veiled reference to our position in Egypt contained in para-graph 10 of the note of the 19th May may be regarded as accepted by the parties to the treaty. If, however, we are to rely on these two declarations and not to insist upon a special unilateral declaration in regard to Egypt at the time of signature, it would be necessary that the substance of para-graph 10 of the note of the 19th May should be conveyed to the Governments of all Powers which will participate in the treaty as original signatories. As regards Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf countries, it is more difficult for the Foreign Office to make any recommendation, but there can be little doubt that, from the point of view of its effects on world opinion, a unilateral declaration in regard to our interests in those countries could be sustained less easily than one in regard to our position in Egypt.Foreign Office, June 29, 1928.List of Appendices.Note from Sir Austen Chamberlain to Mr. Houghton of May 19, 1928.Note from Mr. Atherton to Sir Austen Chamberlain,of June 23, 1928.Despatch respecting the Status of Egypt of March 15, 1922.Appendix 1. : Appendix 2.  Appendix 3. 
APPENDIX 1.Sir Austen Chamberlain t$ Mr. Houghton.four Excellency,Foreign Office, May 19, 1928.YOUR note of the 13th April, containing the text of a draft treaty for the 1 renunciation of war, together with copies of the correspondence between the United I States and French Governments on the subject of this treaty, has been receiving 1 sympathetic consideration at the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great I Britain. A note has also been received from the French Government, containing certain suggestions fcr discussion in connexion with the proposed treaty, and the i&amp;erman Government were good enough to send me a copy of the reply which has Keen made by them to the proposals of the United States Government. I 2. The suggestion for the conclusion of a treaty for the renunciation of &quot;war las an instrument of national policy has evoked widespread interest in this country, land His Majesty&apos;s Government will support the movement to the utmost of their j power.!    3.   After making a careful study of the text contained in your Excellency&apos;s Inote and of the amended text suggested in the French note, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-Iment feel convinced that there is no seric.us divergence between the effect of these I two drafts.   This impressicn is confirmed by a study of the text cf the speech by the Secretary of State of the United States to which your Excellency drew my attention, and which he delivered before the American Society of International Law on the 28th April.  The aim of the United States Government, as I understand it, is to embody in a treaty a broad statement of principle, to proclaim without restriction or qualification that war shall not be used as an instrument of policy. With this aim His Majesty&apos;s Government are wholly in accord.   The French proposals, equally imbued with the same puipcse, have merely added an indication of certain exceptional circumstances in which the violation of that principle by one party may oblige the others to take action seeming at first eight to be inconsistent with the terms of the proposed pact.    His Majesty&apos;s Government appreciate the scruples which have prompted these suggestions by the Fiench Government.   The exact fulfilment of treaty engagements is a matter which affects the national honour; precision as to the scope of such engagements is, therefore, of importance.   Each of the suggestions made by the French Government has been carefully considered from (this point of view.4. After studying the wording of article 1 of the United States draft, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not think that its terms exclude action which a State may be forced to take in self-defence. Mr. Kellogg has made it clear in the speech to which I have referred above that he regards the right of self-defence as inalienable, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are disposed to think that on this question no addition to the text is necessary.5. As regards the text of article 2, no appreciable difference is found between the American and the French proposals. His Majesty&apos;s Government are, therefore, content to accept the former if, as they understand to be the dispute &quot; amongthe high contracting parties &quot; is a phrase wide enough to cover a dispute between any two of them.6. The French note suggests the addition of an article providing that violation of the treaty by one of the parties should release the remainder from their obliga-tions under the treaty towards that party. His Majesty&apos;s Government are not satisfied that, if the treaty stood alone, the addition of some such provision would not be necessary. Mr. Kellogg&apos;s speech, however, shows that he put forward for acceptance the text of the proposed treaty upon the understanding that violation of the undertaking by one party would free the remaining parties from the obligation to observe its terms in respect of the treaty-breaking Stats.7. If it is agreed that this is the principle which will apply in the case of this particular treaty, His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied and will not ask for the insertion of any amendment. Means can no doubt be found without difficulty of placing this understanding on record in some appropriate manner so that it may have equal value with the terms of the treaty itself.8. The point is one of importance because of its bearing on the treaty engage-iients by which His Majesty&apos;s Government are already bound.  The preservation of[17862]o 2
peace has been the chief concern of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the prime object of all their endeavours. It is the reason why they have given ungrudging support to the League of Nations and why they have undertaken the burden of the guarantee embodied in the Locarno Treaty. The sole object of all these engagements is the elimination of war as an instrument of national policy, just as it is the purpose of the peace pact now proposed. It is because the object of both is the same that there is no real antagonism between the treaty engagements which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have already accepted and the pact which is now proposed. The machinery of the Covenant and of the Treaty of Locarno, however, go somewhat further than a renunciation&quot; of war as a policy, in that they provide certain sanctions for a breach of their obligations. A clash might thus conceivably arise between the existing treaties and the proposed pact unless it is understood that the obligations of the new engagement will cease to operate in respect of a party which breaks its pledges and adopts hostile measures against one of its co-contractants.9. For the Government of this country respect for the obligations arising cut of the Covenant of the League of Nations and out of the Locarno treaties is fundamental. Our position in this regard is identical with that of the German Government as indicated in their note of the 27th April. His Majesty&apos;s Government could not agree to any new treaty which would weaken or undermine these engagements on which the peace of Europe rests. Indeed, public interest in this country in the scrupulous fulfilment of these engagements is so great that His Majesty&apos;s Government would for their part prefer to see some such provision as article 4 of the French draft embodied in the text of the treaty. To this we understand there will be no objection. Mr. Kellogg has made it clear in the speech to which I have drawn attention that he had no intention by the terms cf the new treaty of preventing the parties to the Covenant of the League or to the Locarno Treaty from fulfilling their obligations.10. The language of article 1, as to the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy, renders it desirable that I should remind your Excellency that there are certain regions of the world the welfare and integrity of which constitute a special and vital interest for our peace and safety. His Majesty&apos;s Government have been at p&amp;ins to make it clear in the past that interference with these regions cannot be suffered. Their protection against attack is to the British Empire a measure of self-defence. It must be clearly understood that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in Great Britain accept the new treaty upon the distinct understanding that it does not prejudice their freedom of action in this respect. The Government of the United States have comparable interests any disregard of which by a foreign power they have declared that they would regard as an unfriendly act. His Majesty&apos;! Government believe, therefore, that in defining their position they are expressing the intention and meaning of the United States Government&quot;.11. As regards the measure of participation in the new treaty before it would come into force, His Majesty&apos;s Government. agree that it is not necessary to wail until all the nations of the world have signified their willingness to become parties On the other hand, it would be embarrassing if certain States in Europe with whom the proposed participants are already in close treaty relations were not included among the parties. His Majesty&apos;s Government see no reason, however, to doubt that these States will gladly accept its terms. Universality would, in any case, bf difficult of attainment, and might even be inconvenient, for there are some State whose Governments have not yet been universally recognised, and some which an scarcely in a position to ensure the maintenance of good order and security withii their territories. The conditions for the inclusion of such States among the parties to the new treaty is a question to which further attention may perhaps be devotei with advantage. It is, however, a minor question as compared with the attaimneii of the more important purpose in view.12. After this examination of the terms of the proposed treaty and of the point to which it gives rise, your Excellency will realise that His Majesty&apos;s Governmei find nothing in their existing commitments which prevents their hearty co-operatic: in this new movement for strengthening the foundations of peace. They will gladl co-operate in the conclusion of such a pact as is proposed and are ready to engag with the interested Governments in the negotiations which are necessary for tl purpose.13. Your Excellency will observe that the detailed arguments in the foregoitl paragraphs are expressed on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britaij It will, however, be appreciated that the proposed treaty, from its very nature, i not one which concerns His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain alone, but is oi in which they could not undertake to participate otherwise than jointly at
APPENDIX 2.Mr. Atherton to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received June 23.)United States Embassy, Sir, London, June 23, 1928.IT will be recalled that, pursuant to the understanding reached between the Government of Prance and the Government of the United States, the American Ambassadors at London, Berlin, Rome and Tokyo transmitted on the 13th April, 1928, to the Governments,to which they were respectively accredited the text of M. Briand&apos;s original proposal of the 20th June, 1927, together with copies of the notes subsequently exchanged by France and the United States on the subject of a multilateral treaty for the renunciation of war. At the same time the Government of the United States also submitted, for consideration, a preliminary draft of a treaty representing in a general way the form of treaty which it was prepared to sign, and enquired whether the Governments thus addressed were in a position to give favourable consideration thereto. The text of the identic notes of the 13th April, 1928, and a copy of the draft treaty transmitted therewith were also brought to the attention of the Government of France by the American Ambassador at Paris.It will likewise be recalled that, on the 20th April, 1928, the Government of the French Republic circulated among the other interested Governments, including the Government of the United States, an alternative draft treaty, and that, in an address which he delivered on the 28th April, 1928, before the American Society of International Law, the Secretary of State of the United States explained fully the construction placed by my Government upon the treaty proposed by it, referring as follows to the six major considerations emphasised by France in its alternative draft treaty and prior diplomatic correspondence with my Government: &quot;1. Self-defence.&quot; There is nothing in the American draft of an anti-war treaty which restricts or impairs in any way the right of self-defence. That right is inherent in every sovereign State and is implicit in every treaty. Every nation is free at all times, and regardless of treaty provisions, to defend its territories from attack or invasion, and it alone is competent to decide whether circumstances require recourse to war in self-defence. If it has a good case, the world will applaud and not condemn its action. Express recognition by treaty of this inalienable right, however, gives rise to the same difficulty encountered in any effort to define aggression. It is the identical question approached from the other side. In this respect, no treaty provision can add to the natural right of self-defence. It is not in the interest of peace that a treaty should stipulate a juristic conception of self-defence, since it is far too easy for the unscrupulous to mould events to accord with an agreed definition.2. The League Covenant. .&quot; The Covenant imposes no affirmative primary obligation to go to war. The obligation, if any, is secondary, and attaches only when deliberately accepted by a State. Article 10 of the Covenant has, for example, been interpreted by a resolution submitted to the Fourth Assembly, but not formally adopted owing to one adverse vote, to mean that: &apos; It is for the constitutional authorities of each member to decide, in reference to the obligation of preserving the independencesimultaneously with His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions and the Govern-raent of India. They have, therefore, been in communication with those Govern-ments, and I am happy to be able to inform your Excellency that, as a result of the ccmmunioations which have passed, it has been ascertained that they are all in cordial agreement with the general principle of the proposed treaty. I feel confident, therefore, that, on receipt of an invitation to participate in the conclusion of such a treaty, th.3y, no less than His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain, will be prepared to accept the invitation.I have, &amp;c.AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.
and the integrity of the territory of the members, in what degree the member is bound to assure the execution of this obligation by employment of its military forces.&apos;&quot; There is, in my opinion, no necessary inconsistency between the Covenant and the idea of an unqualified renunciation of war. The Covenant can, it is true, be construed as authorising war in certain circumstances, but it is an authorisation and not a positive requirement.3. The Treaties of Locarno.&quot; If the parties to the treaties of Locarno are under any positive obligation to go to war, such obligation certainly would not attach until one of the parties has resorted to war in violation of its solemn pledges thereunder. It is therefore obvious that, if all the parties to the Locarno treaties become parties to the multilateral anti-war treaty proposed by the United States, there would be a double assurance that the Locarno treaties would not be violated by recourse to arms. In such an event it would follow that resort to war by any State, in violation of the Locarno treaties, would also be a breach of the multilateral anti-war treaty, and the other parties to the anti-war treaty would thus, as a matter of law, be automatically released from their obligations thereunder and free to fulfil their Locarno commitments. The United States is entirely willing that all parties to the Locarno treaties should become parties to its proposed anti-war treaty, either through signature in the first instance, or by immediate accession to the treaty as soon as it comes into force in the manner provided in article 3 of the American draft, and it will offer no objection when and if such a suggestion is made.4. Treaties of Neutrality.&quot; The United States is not informed as to the precise treaties which France has in mind, and cannot, therefore, discuss their provisions. It is not unreasonable to suppose, however, that the relations between France and the States whose neutrality she has guaranteed are sufficiently close and intimate to make it possible for France to persuade such States to adhere seasonably to the anti-war treaty proposed by the United States. If this were done, no party to the anti-war treaty could attack the neutralised States without violating thej treaty, and thereby automatically freeing France and the other Powers in respect of the treaty-breaking State from the obligations of the anti-war treaty-. If the neutralised States were attacked by a State not a party to the anti-war treaty, the latter treaty would, of course, have no bearing, and France would be as free to act under the treaties guaranteeing neutrality as if she were not a party to the anti-war treaty. It is difficult to conceive, therefore, how treaties guaranteeing neutrality can be regarded as necessarily preventing the conclusion by France or any other Power of a multilateral treaty for the renunciation of war.5. Relations with a Treaty-breaking State.&apos;&apos; As I have already pointed out, there can be no question, as a matter of law, that violation of a multilateral anti-war treaty through resort to war by one party thereto would automatically release the other parties from their obligations to the treaty-breaking States. Any express recognition of this principle of law is wholly unnecessary.6. Universality.&quot;From the beginning it has been the hope of the United States that itsj proposed multilateral anti-war treaty should be worldwide in its application, and appropriate provision therefor was made in the draft submitted to the other I Governments on the 13th April. From a practical standpoint, it is clearly preferable, however, not to postpone the coming into force of an anti-war treaty until all the nations of the world can agree upon the text of such a treaty and cause it to be ratified. For one reason or another, a State so situated as to be no menace to the peace of the world might obstruct agreement or delay ratification in such manner as to render abortive the efforts of all the other Powers.   It is
mhighly improbable, moreover, that a form of treaty acceptable to the British, French, German, Italian and Japanese Governments, as well as to the United States, would not be equally acceptable to most if not all of the other Powers of the world. Even were this not the case, however, the coming into force among the above-named six Powers of an effective anti-war treaty and their observance thereof would be a practical guaranty against a second world war. This in itself would be a tremendous service to humanity, and the United States is not willing to jeopardise the practical success of the proposal which it has made by conditioning the coming into force of the treaty upon prior universal or almost universal acceptance.&quot;The British, German, Italian and Japanese Governments have nOw replied to my Governments notes of the 13th April, 1928, and the Governments of the British Dominions and of India have likewise replied to the invitations addressed to them on the 22nd May, 1928, by my Government, pursuant to the suggestion conveyed in the note of the 19th May, 1928, from His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain. None of these Governments have expressed any dissent from the above-quoted construction, and none has voiced the least disapproval of the principle underlying the proposal of the United States for the promotion of world peace. Neither has any of the replies received by the Government of the United States suggested any specific modification of the text of the draft treaty proposed by it on the 13th April, 1928, and my Government, for its part, remains convinced that no modification of the text of its proposal for a multilateral treaty for the renunciation of war is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of any nation. It believes that the right of self-defence is inherent in every sovereign State and implicit in every treaty. No specific reference to that inalienable attribute of sovereignty is therefore necessary or desirable. It is no less evident that resort to war, in violation of the proposed treaty by one of the parties thereto, would release the other parties from their obligations under the treaty towards the belligerent State. This principle is well recognised. So far as the Locarno treaties are concerned, my Government has felt, from the very first, that participation in the anti-war treaty by the Powers which signed the Locarno agreements, either through signature in the first instance or thereafter, would meet every practical requirement of the situation, since, in such event, no State could resort to war in violation of the Locarno treaties without simultaneously violating the anti-war treaty, thus leaving the other parties thereto free so far as the treaty-breaking State is concerned. As you know, the Government of the United States has welcomed the idea that all parties to the treaties of Locarno should be among the original signatories of the proposed treaty for the renunciation of war, and provision therefor has been made in the draft treaty which I have the honour to transmit herewith. The same procedure would cover the treaties guaranteeing neutrality to which the Government of France has referred. Adherence to the proposed treaty by all parties to these other treaties would completely safe-guard their rights, since subsequent resort to war by any of them, or by any party to the anti-war treaty, would violate the latter treaty as well as the neutrality treaty, and thus leave the other parties to the anti-war treaty free, so far as the treaty-breaking State is concerned. My Government would be entirely willing, however, to agree that the parties to such neutrality treaties should be original signatories of the multilateral anti-war treaty, and it has no reason to believe that such an arrangement would meet with any objection on the part of the other Governments now concerned in the present negotiations.While my Government is satisfied that the draft treaty proposed by it on the 13th April, 1928, could be properly accepted by the Powers of the world without change, except for including among the original signatories the British Dominions, India, all parties to the treaties of Locarno, and, it may be, all parties to the neutrality treaties mentioned by the Government of France, it has no desire to delay or complicate the present negotiations by rigidly adhering to the precise phraseology of that draft, particularly since it appears that, by modifying the draft m form, though not in substance, the points raised by other Governments can be satisfactorily met and general agreement upon the text of the treaty to be signed be promptly reached. The Government of the United States has therefore decided to submit to the fourteen other Governments now concerned in these negotiations a revised draft of a multilateral treaty for the renunciation of war. The text of this revised draft is identical with that of the draft proposed by the United States on the 13th April, 1928, except that the preamble now provides that the British Dominions, India and all parties to the treaties of Locarno are to be included among the Powers called upon to sign the treaty in the first instance, and
except that the first three paragraphs of the preamble have been changed to read as follows: Deeply sensible of their solemn duty to promote the welfare of mankind;Persuaded that the time has come when a frank renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy should be made to the end that the peaceful and friendly relations now existing between their peoples may be perpetuated;&quot; Convinced that all changes in their relations with one another should be sought only by pacific means and be the result of a peaceful and orderly process, and that any signatory Power which shall hereafter seek to promote its national interests by resort to war should be denied the benefits furnished by this treaty.&quot;The revised preamble thus gives express recognition to the principle that, if a State resorts to war in violation of the treaty, the other contracting parties are released from their obligations under the treaty to that State. It also provides for participation in the treaty by all parties to the treaties of Locarno, thus making it certain that resort to war, in violation of the Locarno treaties, would also violate the present treaty and release not only the other signatories of the Locarno treaties but also the other signatories to the anti-war treaty from their obligations to the treaty-breaking State. Moreover, as stated above, my Government would be willing to have included among the original signatories the parties to the neutrality treaties referred to by the Government of the French Republic, although it believes that the interests of those States would be adequately safeguarded if, instead of signing in the first instance, they should choose to adhere to the treaty.In these circumstances, I have the honour to transmit herewith, for the con-sideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa, as well as for the consideration of the Government of India, a draft of a multilateral treaty for the renunciation of war, containing the changes outlined above. I have been instructed to state in this connexion that the Government of the United States is ready to sign at once a treaty in the form herein proposed, and to express the fervent hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and also His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ments in the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa, as well as the Government of India, will be able promptly to indicate their readiness to accept without qualification or reservation the form of treaty suggested by the United States.If th3 Governments of Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Great Britain, India, the Irish Free State, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Poland, South Africa ?nd the United States can now agree to conclude this anti-war treaty among themselves, my Government is confident that the other nations of the world will, as soon as the treaty comes into force, gladly adhere thereto, and that this simple procedure will bring mankind&apos;s age-long aspirations for universal peace nearer to practical fulalment than ever before in the history of the world.I have the honour to state, in conclusicn, that the Government cf the United States would be pleased to be informed, at as early a date as may bs convenient, whether His Majes^y&apos;s Government in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa, as well as the Government of India, are willing to join with the United States and ether similarly disposed Governments in signing a definitive treaty for the renunciation of war in the form transmitted herewith.I have, &amp;c.RAY ATHERTON, Charge d&apos;Affaires ad interim.Enclosure in No. 1.

In informing the Government to which you are accredited of this decision you should communicate the following notification:  &quot; When the peace and prosperity of Egypt were menaced in December 1914 by the intervention of Turkey in the Great War in alliance with the Central Powers, His Majesty&apos;s Government terminated the suzerainty of Turkey over Egypt, took the country under their protection and declared it to be a British protectorate.
o&quot; The situation is now changed. Egypt has emerged from the war prosperous and unscathed, and His Majesty&apos;s Government, after grave consideration and in accordance with their traditional policy, have decided to terminate the protectorate by a declaration in which they recognise Egypt as an independent sovereign State, while preserving for future agreements between Egypt and themselves certain matters in which the interests and obligations of the British Empire are specially involved. Pending such agreements, the status quo as regards these matters will remain unchanged.&quot; The Egyptian Government will be at liberty to re-establish a Ministry for Foreign Affairs and thus to prepare the way for the diplomatic and consular representation of Egypt abroad.&quot; Great Britain will not in future accord protection to Egyptians in foreign countries, except in so far as may be desired by the Egyptian Government and pending the representation of Egypt in the country concerned.&quot;The termination of the British protectorate over Egypt involves, however, no change in the status quo as regards the position of other Powers in Egypt itself.&quot; The welfare and integrity of Egypt are necessary to the peace and safety of the British Empire, which will therefore always maintain as an essential British interest the special relations between itself and Egypt long recognised by ether Governments. These special relations are defined in the declaration recognising Egypt as an independent sovereign State. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have laid them down as matters in which the rights and interests of the British Empire are vitally involved, and will not admit them to be questioned or discussed by any other Power. In pursuance of this principle, they will regard as an unfriendly act any attempt at interference in the affairs of Egypt by another Power, and they will consider any aggression against the territory of Egypt as an act to be repelled with all the means at their command.&quot;I am, &amp;c.CURZON OF KEDLESTON.
