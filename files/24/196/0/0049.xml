[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.](Printed for the Cabinet.        July 192S.)The &quot;No-tax&quot; Movement in the Bardoli Taluka, Bombay.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a copy of further telegraphic correspondence which has passed between myself, the Viceroy and the Governor of Bombay since this question was discussed in the Cabinet.India Office, BIRKENHEAD.21st July 1928.From Viceroy, 16th July 19SS (received in full 18th July). 464 S.   Private and personal.   Bardoli.1. I have discussed situation fully with Leslie Wilson and Rieu and my Council. I should explain in the first place what Government of Bombay mean by emphasising in their letter of 1st July importance of conciliating public opinion, a point which you were disposed to question in your telegram of 10th July. Though Bombay Governments case appears to them to be unchallengeable on its merits, there is no question that, owing to misrepresentation, by utilising sentences divorced from general context, and skilful use of remarks made by the Settlement Commissioner, disparaging conclusions of Settlement Officer, moderate opinion is ranged very strongly against Government, and that this opinion represents genuine conviction and is not merely swinging with tide. There is a genuine belief that settlement has not been a fair one to cultivators and requires re-examination.2. Position of those objecting to assessment has been, and is, that assessment is arbitrary, unjust and oppressive ; that, in consequence, the villagers are determined not to pay it, and that the Government should therefore suspend its collection and order a re-examination of.whole case by an impartial tribunal, which, no doubt, means a tribunal partly or wholly non-official. In pursuance of this policy an intensive and well-organised agitation has been conducted, results of which have been already stated in Bombay Governments official letter of 9th June. Leslie Wilson wishes to make it plain that description of Vallabhai&apos;s letter in para. 8 as an ultimatum puts the matter higher than actual language employed warrants. I have only now seen the letter, which states that he had been approached by cultivators who bad declared their determination to resort to civil disobedience, but that he had persuaded, them to wait till he had communicated with Wilson. Although letter clearly contemplated possibility of serious difficulty between Government and cultivators, it was couched in perfectly respectful terms, and I should never, mySelf, have dreamt of describing it as an ultimatum. The reason for mentioning period of a week was that at end of that period, in accordance with Government orders, collection of new assessment was due to begin. Nevertheless, the action of Vallabhai in taking lead in this campaign of disobedience, which started six days after receipt of his letter, clearly amounted to an open defiance of assessment imposed in accordance with law, and he has been largely responsible for instituting an elaborate campaign, which has met with a wide measure of success, to induce the people not to pay new assessment and to demand, in fact, that new assessment should be torn up and whole matter referred to a tribunal of kind above described. If this attitude is maintained, Government can do nothing except continue to enforce law and to use all powers at its command.3. Present situation in Taluka as regards Government measures is as follows: All holdings belonging to non-agriculturalists, totalling about 15,000 acres, have been forfeited, and up to date some 1,600 acres out of this area have been disposed of to new owners. Of land in possession of defaulters who are agriculturalists, which is about 100,000 acres, about half has been forfeited to the Government, but not yet disposed of. This is still being cultivated hj the occupants, but they have been warned that the whole of the crops will be the property of the Government. Steps are being taken to forfeit the remainder of land in possession of agriculturalists and to 2951      75   7.2S        -   &apos;&apos; &apos; &apos;&quot;*&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;SECRET.O .P. 249(28).
treat it in the same way. The land which has already been disposed of - is being-cultivated by old tenants.4. The further measures which are in contemplation are as follows: First, the disposal of considerable area of land held by non-agriculturalists which has already been forfeited but not yet disposed of. There are over 13,000 acres of such land, and it is believed that purchasers will be forthcoming as applications for an aggregate of 23,000 acres have already been received and further applications are coming in. The effect of sale of 1,600 acres already disposed of was appreciable, and, if measures are taken steadily to dispose of the remainder, Wilson fully expects that the moral effect will be considerable. Second, it is proposed to proceed With the forfeiture of all remaining land held by agriculturalist defaulters, accompanied by the declaration of this land as Government property and a warning to cultivators that the whole of the crops will be the property of the Government. It is not intended immediately to dispose of land of agriculturalists, but the question of doing so in selected cases is being considered. Third, when the crops are ripe, Govern-ment can proceed to enforce its claim to them. It is not proposed at present to touch food crops, for obvious reasons, but most valuable crop of Taluka is cotton, and it is intended to seize the whole of the cotton grown on forfeited land. Wilson. is satisfied that effective measures can be taken to secure this result, but cotton crop only begins to be picked in December. Fourth, active steps are being taken to replace Talatis who have joined the agitation. Fifth, it may be possible in some cases to continue distraint of movable property, though this is handicapped by the weather.5. The possible weak spot in this programme is that the time for the decisive measures involved in the seizure of the cotton crops is five months distant. If the sale of land of non-agriculturalists and threat to sell the land of agriculturalists is not sufficient to break the movement, it will be necessary to take steps, by use of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1908 or other means, to strike at the men who are organising the agitation. Bombay Government, however, feel strongly, and I agree, that immediate policy should be to press on with measures of forfeiture, sale and warning, as it is evident ^that if these produce the result we want we shall have succeeded in discrediting the movement instead of making martyrs of its leaders.6. I suggested last week to Wilson that he should pay a visit to the district himself, and he is accordingly proceeding straight from here to Surat, where he arrives on Wednesday. He thinks it essential that he&apos;should see all the Government officers on the spot, and without specifying A7allabhai, whom he has always refused to summon, has expressed his willingness to receive a deputation of persons who can speak for the cultivators. He will make clear to them the determination of the Government, if need be, to enforce payment. There are, however, indications that the other side may be anxious not to pursue the struggle to the bitter end. Wilson and I both agree that the first conditions of any settlement must be an immediate cessation of agitation, the payment of the revised assessment and abandonment of the claim for a non-official enquiry. We then consider that Government may, on being satisfied on these points, agree to grant an official enquiry into any alleged errors of calculation or fact affecting the whole or individual assessments, it would have to be made plain that the enquiry would not be one into the principles of land revenue settlement, but merely into the facts of this particular case. The object would be to prove to the moderate man that the assessment is a reasonable one, and the Bombay Government have no doubt that a further enquiry would establish this plainly.As a matter of fact, Leslie Wilson had already, at the end of April, assured two-members of the Legislative Council who interviewed him that when revised assessment had been paid, Government would direct Collector to enquire into any cases in which revision was alleged to have resulted in hardship. It may be taken as certain that this assurance would be made the basis for applications from practically all cultivators for further enquiry, so that something in the nature of a further detailed examination of the facts appears in any case to be inevitable. The enquiry Would have to be a detailed one, conducted on the spot, and could not commence until the cold weather. Various suggestions have been made by would be peacemakers as to the methods by which assessment might be paid. Wilson and 1 are agreed that precise method adopted is of minor importance compared with assertion of principle that actual amount due to the Government must be paid into the treasury before the Government *an do anything else.
its7. If it is clear, when Leslie Wilson goes, that agitators are not prepared to call off agitation, and there is no prospect of immediate payment of revised revenue, or if there is no clear indication of their attitude, then Leslie Wilson proposes to state in opening his Legislative Council on the 23rd instant, what the Government of Bombay had been, and indeed still would be prepared to do, provided that they received within a fortnight a clear assurance of termination of movements. He will at the same time make it plain that if this course is rejected by the inhabitants of Taluka, and those who speak for them, Government will take all necessary steps to enforce compliance with the law, and to crush a movement which would then clearly be exposed as one not directed to representing reasonable grievances and to securing a re-examination of facts, but to coercing the Government by such action.From Secretary of State to Governor of Bombay, 18th July 1928.(Repeated to Viceroy, 19th July 1928.)1992. Private and personal. I understand from Viceroy and from Press that you are going to Surat and will meet deputation of which Patel may be a member. I trust you will make it plain that you are there to announce decision of Government and not to negotiate, and will bear in mind that it is not our policy to save Patel&apos;s face, but on the contrary to discredit him and his supporters by all possible means and even at the cost of some prolongation of the struggle. I entirely approve your personal attitude as described in your private letters ending with that of 28th June, and I gather you have support of your Executive Council. You seem to me to be in strong position, for publication of your Governments letter of 9th -June would convince every reasonable person, though not, of course, Indian politicians, that -economic element in the struggle is of quite secondary, importance, and any weakening of your attitude would therefore be unintelligible either in India or here, except in the sense that Government no longer intends to govern. I appreciate your anxiety -on Sykes&apos; account, but a Settlement which does not involve complete and palpable defeat of agitation will be no help to him. Subject is arousing great interest Here, not only in Cabinet, but also in Conservative Party, where apparent supineness of Government has come in for much criticism. I shall do my best to dispel it, for I am ^satisfied that you are doing and intend to do all that the authority and prestige of the Government require.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 19th Jidy 1928.1996. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram of 16th July. Bardoli. I am repeating to you telegram which I have thought it desirable to send to Leslie Wilson. I am not greatly-impressed by argument about moderate public opinion in Bombay, which, if it exists, cannot fail to see the hollowness of the agitation if Government of Bombay publish the right papers. Indians of all kinds -come to this Office and urge that Government should stand firm. The professional politicians, of course, will not be persuaded.As regards para. 5 of your telegram, I agree that we do not want to make martyrs of Patel and other leaders, but does it not go rather against the grain to leave them, at liberty to begin again elsewhere while we dispossess their miserable victims, whose real offence is that they have believed in politicians whom the British Government has created and whom it treats as friends and equals ? I must leave that to you, but I trust that they too will be made to suffer.I understand from para. 6 that if there is to be enquiry it will be only into specific allegations as to particular assessments, and that no unofficials will be associated with it. This I regard as essential, and indeed must insist on. I also hope that no such suggestions will be entertained as are mentioned in para. 6 of Wilson&apos;s letter of 26th June to you.Course outlined in para. 7 of your telegram seems to me generally suitable, except that if I were Wilson I should allow no further time for palaver, but should announce on 23rd Avhat Government intend to do as from that date, and do it. Locus poenhenti.ee, will only be used for further organisation against Government which may be difficult to deal with if allowed to take shape ; e.g. Times to-day reports threats of arson.I see reference to Gandhi in para. 3 of Wilson&apos;s letter to you of 28th June. I hope he will be neither invited nor allowed to intervene.I am glad to find myself in general agreement with you and Wilson as to policy to -foe pursued now.   But whole history of agitation enforces maxim obstare principles.
From Governor of Bombay, 19th July 1928.Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram dated 18th July,. No. 1992, received on my way back from Surat.I laid conditions, as agreed with Viceroy, before deputation headed by Patel yesterday, and said that they were final.   He was unwilling to accept, trying for some concession to save his face, but I naturally refused to go any further.   Hope you will not credit everything reported in the Press.   Some very misleading statements-are being made.   Government quite firm.   I am addressing the Legislative Council on Monday and feel sure you will agree with what I propose to say.   Shall proceed as agreed with Viceroy.   Position can easily be misunderstood at home, as powers of Government to deal with passive civil disobedience are very limited unless we proceed under the Criminal Law Amendment Act as suggested in Viceroy&apos;s telegram, which we shall do unless complete surrender to our conditions.   I hardly expect the-full agreement of my Executive Council to this ; but can carry with the majority... Very grateful for your support in most difficult circumstances.From Viceroy, 19th July 1928.473 S.   Private and personal.   My private and personal telegram of 16th July,. No. 464 S.   Bardoli.   Leslie Wilson wires from camp that he had meetings-all day 18th, but arrived at ho agreement.   Vallabhai Patel appears to have spoken for the-other side, and claimed that payment of the new assessment should be suspended pending the result of the enquiry.   He also disagreed with the character of the ^enquiry, and proposed judicial enquiry first into the conduct by the Settlement Officer of the Settlement, and, if that conduct were found unsatisfactory, a fresh enquiry by the Revenue Office, preferably assisted by non-officials.   I do not quite understand the object of this, but it is interesting that he does not seem to lay great stress on the presence of non-officials in any enquiry that might be held.   Patel also-claimed that Government should take action regarding the lands forfeited and sold. Leslie Wilson is not hopeful of any settlement emerging, though discussions are still taking place betweeji&apos; Patel and his friends.   Wilson proposes to address himself to* the subject on the lines of my telegram of the 16th instant, No. 464 S., when, he opens the Council on Monday.
