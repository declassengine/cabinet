[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, jPrinted for the Cabinet.SECRET. Copy No.    28CP. 210 (1928.)CABINET.unemployment.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and for the Colonies.THE situation disclosed in the recent returns from the Ministry of Labour and in the Report of the Industrial Transference Board is such that it is no longer possible to ignore its gravity. For eight years unemployment in this country has fluctuated between a million and two and a half million persons, and for only a few days at a time has it dropped below the million mark. For a time we may have deluded our^ selves with the idea that we were suffering from the unsettled state of Europe, and that our difficulties were of a temporary character. At&apos; a later stage the coal stoppage again encouraged us to think of our problem as a transient one. But hard facts are beginning to compel us to realise that our troubles are neither temporary nor due to purely external causes, but are fundamental and inherent in our own national policy. To quote the language of the Report, in reference to the districts most affected by the present state of the heavy industries, &quot; the idea of a transient depression must now be recognised quite unflinchingly as no longer tenable. In the coal industry to-day out of 1,164,000 insured workers less than 950,000 are employed. But these are only doing the full time work of 850,000, so that it seems inevitable that with the progres-sive improvement in economical working, shutting down of unprofitable mines, cfec., the total surplus of ooal miners alone will be at least 250,000. The Report also refers to the 100,000 wholly unemployed in iron, steel and heavy engineering, who, judging by present indications, seem no less likely to be condemned to the category of permanent surplus. It does not dwell on the gravity of the long drawn out crisis in the cotton industry or on the not too cheerful position of the woollen17881 b
industry. It points out that there is considerable expansion in motor car. manufacture, artificial silk, furniture making, printing and publishing, and electrical engineering-all, incidentally, industries enjoying a con-siderable measure of legislative or natural protection but does not suggest that there is in these industries any possibility of expansion sufficient to absorb the surplus of the heavy industries, or the rest of the great army of unemployed. That army, according to the Minister of Labour&apos;s figures, is to-day 150,000 larger than this time last year, and is, I gather, likely to grow still further before the winter. The average cost to the community of its maintenance since the Armistice has been about  85,000,000 a year. The total extent of the evil is aggravated by the fact that it is largely concentrated in certain districts which are rapidly becoming derelict. It is almost impossible to exaggerate the distress, the demoralisation, the weakening of the whole economic fabric of the State, the danger of revolution, which are implied in such a situation.What suggestions for.dealing with this grave situation are furnished by the Report? One is the stimulation of migration. In another memorandum (CP. 198 (28) ) I have submitted figures to show that it should be possible, under present conditions, to settle overseas some 21,500 persons a year from the distressed mining areas at a very moderate cost. That figure could no doubt be greatly increased, as I shall point out later in this paper. The other is transference from the most depressed to the less depressed areas, not a very helpful or hopeful suggestion-when the general state of industry is taken into account. That the Report has nothing more to offer except such very partial palliatives is, however, not surprising, as the Board have felt themselves precluded from dealing with issues of a fundamental, and consequently controversial, character either in their analysis of the causes of the present situation or in their recommendations. That may have been a perfectly right and proper attitude for the Board to take up. But it obviously is an impossible one for the Cabinet to adopt- Both on merits and on grounds of political self-preservation we have got to face the facts, find practical remedies and carry them into effect. Further fumbling with the situation will mean well-merited political extinction.What are the elementary facts of the situation&apos;? The first and most fundamental is that British wage rates are from 50 to 200 per cent, higher than those of the European countries with which we have to compete. Our only chance of holding our own, in face of this fact, would be if our industries enjoyed some equivalent countervailing advantage of greater individual skill, more efficient or larger scale organisation, much lower taxation or a specially sheltered market. The first two advantages they certainly enjoyed in the past; they do not enjoy them to-day. As regards the two latter, not only is British taxation of alb kinds, including rates and insurance contributions, much higher than on the Continent, but the whole of it is imposed on British
production, while competitive foreign production is untaxed so far as this country is concerned. The: position, as I pointed out:in a previous paper (CP. 116: (28)), is, in fact, that all British&apos; production is subject to a veiled cumulative excise of something like 20 per cent., to which there is no corresponding customs duty. British production is thus doubly handicapped&apos;: by higher wages and by the heavy fiscal preference accorded to foreign competitors in the British Market. These difficulties, over-whelming in themselves, have been still further aggravated since the war by inflation abroad and by deflation carried to disastrous lengths at home.Given these facts, what is the remedy ? We can at once dismiss the idea that . there is any lowering of wages conceivable in this country which will bridge the gap. That solution is not only politically impossible, but economically unsound. Our high wages and our social services have at any rate acted as a fly-wheel in keeping up the consuming power of the home market and afforded employment to the more sheltered industries. Nor is there any reduction of total taxation conceivable that can meet the needs of the case. Our national and Imperial standard of living is no more susceptible of drastic reduction than our social standard. Such a rearrangement of burdens as is involved in the present Budget will undoubtedly.be of some assistance, especially to the heavy industries. But, by itself, it is quite inadequate as a solution of the problem. Nor is inflation possible, even if it were desirable, on any scale that could countervail our other handicaps. For one thing the mischief has been done, and the objections to abandoning such advantages as we have secured by a return to gold parity would be economically very serious and politically insuperable. The .most; we can do in that direction is to secure some relaxation of the pedantry which at present restricts the extension of credit facilities and forbids the guai&apos;anteeing of productive enterprise at home or in the Empire.There remains the one obvious remedy, no doubt controversial politically, but incontrovertible as common sense, of giving our industries some measure of shelter in the home market, and at least spreading the. burden of our taxation so as to cover all the goods that are sold in that market. Not only is that the most obvious remedy, but it is the only one that can operate on any adequate scale with sufficient promptitude. Moreover, it has the immense advantage that it can give help to those who need it in their own industries and in their own homes. At this moment we are importing iron and steel at a rate equivalent to the full-&apos; time employment of 135,000 men a year, of whom, at least, 40,000 would be coal miners required to produce the 10,000,000 tons of coal represented in that import. The imposition of a duty which would restrict those imports by ,75 per cent, would employ about 100,000 men in the most depressed industries and: in the hardest hit localities. It would do more in a yearfhan migration could do in five years, or domestic transference in twenty years.   Last year the retained imports of foreign manufactures,
excluding goods already subject to-safeguarding duties, and articles only in the first stages of manufacture such as-copper ingots, &amp;c, were about  230,000,000. If safeguarding duties at an average of 25 per cent: excluded half Of these, they would provide employment, direct and indirect, for at the very least 500,000 people.An increase of employment of 500,000 people would involve an increase in the yield of our national taxation of, say,  20,000,000. It would involve a saving of at least  30,000,000 to the community in unemployment benefit and relief. The  115,000,000 of foreign goods that still come in would yield not far off  30,000,000 in revenue, largely drawn from the foreign producer and the British middleman. A relief to our national burdens of  80,000,000 would be an immense stimuhis to every industry. It would more than compensate for any conceivable increase in the cost of production resulting from the duties, for even if the whole  230,000,000 were made 25 per cent, dearer by the imposition of the duties, that would only amount to  58,000,000. As a matter of fact experience has shown that&apos; prices are not raised by safeguarding duties to the extent of the duty or anything like it. So far from being handicapped in the export market our industries would be substantially helped by the general lightening of the burden of taxation as well as by larger scale production in the industries which actually secured protection. It is a significant fact that, comparing the first four months of 1928 with the first four months of 1925, our exports of safeguarded manufactures have gone up by 123 per cent, while our exports of non-safeguarded rhanufactures went down by 11&apos;4 per cent.If strengthening our position in the home market is thus calculated to help our export trade, the securing and maintaining of a sheltered position in the Empire market through the extension of Imperial preference will not only directly help our export trade to the Empire, already nearly half our total export trade, but correspondingly strengthen our export trade to foreign countries. Any advance, therefore, which we can make in Imperial Preference in this country that will encourage the Dominions to maintain or extend their preferences, or the effect of which will be to enable them to support a larger population, is of. the greatest importance to the employment position. Incidentally, also, it is only&apos; through the extension of Imperial Preference that we can hope to see a really large development of migration. The Report of the Industrial Transference Board while laying stress, and not without reason, on the many tiresome restrictions which have been imposed on assisted migration to the Dominions, has, I think, failed to realise the extent to which the rapid development of the Dominions depends upon their securing a market. A steady market is the essential requisite for a steady flow of migration, and for an attitude of mind overseas which welcomes that steady flow By providing that market we can help our own industrial position both by relieving the pressure on our own population and by
building up our own best markets. That there are irrational, but none the. less formidable, psychological factors in the way of any full scale system of Imperial Preference covering all the essential articles of food, is a fact of which we are all aware. But even such an extension as could be secured within the compass of a rearrangement of our existing food duties would have an enormous effect on actual development in the Dominions, and on their power of absorbing population, and even more on their whole attitude towards Empire trade and migration.What should be the method of giving effect to any decision on these issues must be a matter of tactics calling for the most careful considera-tion. Declarations have been made against any alteration of the White Paper on Safeguarding in this Parliament, and the Prime Minister has stated that the safeguarding Of a basic industry of the magnitude of the iron and steel industry &quot; would have repercussions of a wider character which might be held to be in conflict with our declaration in regard to a general tariff.&quot; The most prudent, as well as the most honest and courageous course, would be to say frankly that the situation is too. serious for the Government to be rigidly bound by these declarations, which, after all, were in no sense necessarily involved in our election pledges, and to proceed at once to the farthest length that reasonable interpretation of those pledges would allow. That would enable us to -have achieved something before the election, and not expose us to the taunt that we had done nothing, and only brought forward a policy for election purposes. Failing that our next best course would be to make our intention clear at the earliest possible date, secure all the time we can for education of the public, and then embody our proposals in the next Budget, to take effect after the election. That would be consistent with the narrowest reading of our pledges, and give us the advantage of fighting on a concrete scheme and not on the abstract issue of Free Trade and Protection. One way or other the issue has to be faced, and. to.&quot; postpone its consideration any further at this stage in the life of the-Government can only lead to disaster.L. S.
