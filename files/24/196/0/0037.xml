*S %j/ fjDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JES TY&apos;&apos;S . GOVERNMENT) .CABINET.THE USE OF, GAS, IN THE SUPPRESSION OF CIVIL DISTURBANCES.Memorandum by the Lord Priv?,r Seal. (Reference CP. 22 8 (28).)The position that lachrymatory gas may properly be used tn the case of civil disturbance but not in the case of war is impossible to maintain.      Further,  if ,this be conceded it would be pointed out and the public would be convinced that the position that lachrymatory gas. may be used in war, but iethai.gas may not be used would in practice have elements of weakness. &apos;    And on this question we cannot afford elements.of weakness.      Not only are we committed to the Geneva Gas Protocol, but anyone who listened to the debate in the House of Lords last Wednesday must be convinced that public opinion would be outraged by any tampering with the use of gas.With great respect to the Secretary of State for War, for my part I am satisfied that this is not the moment when any decision for the use of gas in the case    of civil disturbance can be contemplated, although of course I understand and appreciate the reasons v/hich have   led him to-take a different view.C RET.257  (28).(intd. ).
