Board of Trade,16th July, 1928TOCPMENE IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAftNIC MAJESTY&apos;S QOVEBMkEaTO.CABINET.SECRET *, N0.-28CP.227(28). TRADE OUTLOOK.Memorandum, by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the accompanying minutes of the last meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council held on the 4th July.The report again presents a gloomy picture in spite of the Improvement in export trade shown in the June returns. Coal exports are rather better;   but prices are lowe Although shipping freights are, if anything, lower than a month ago, shipbuilders report an encouraging number of inquiries.     Apart from this, there is no improvement in steel prospects, but rather the reverse.   The tinplate and sheet trade, which was the one bright spot, maintains its improvement.     Non-ferrous metals continue dull.In engineering there is no marked change;   exports of machinery have been fairly good.The best that can be said of cotton is that there have been rather more inquiries.     The woollen and worsted trades, which were bad, are worse.     Artificial silk Is normal. Hosiery is dull;   and so are boots.     Chemicals, which have been another pleasant contrast, go on improving.Railway traffics reflect the general picture. There is some evidence that present purchasing power has been reduced by people mortgaging their incomes to pay for houses and furniture.P.C.-L.

RAILWAY RATES ON COAL.SIR DAVID MILNE-?/AT SON observed that, under the rating proposals for the relief of industry, railways were to get. something like  4,000,000 in relief, which they had to pass on. The understanding, at any rate, seemed to be that this would be passed on by reduction of railway rates on coal, but there was understood to be a movement in favour of limiting this relief to certain classes of coal, namely coal for export, bunkers and iron and steel.     Sir David thought, however, that the relief ought to be given on all coalj    to give it on coal for export and for bunkers was simply to enable coal to be sold cheaper abroad, and help the foreign manufacturer to compete with the home manufacturer.THE PRESIDENT thought that much might be said in favour of spreading this relief over all coal, and he would like the opinion of the Council on the point.   But he did not believe that by giving a relief on railway rates for export we would increase the competitive power of our foreign competitors in any material degree.   The bulk of the coal which was exported from this country went to railways and public utilities, and a comparatively small amount into industrial consumption.   The only foreign industry he could think of which would be materially assisted by a rating relief on British exported coal would be the steel industry in Belgium.     But the . keenest advocates of the rating proposals were the steel makers in this country, who had to face the Belgian competition.SIR DAVID MILNE-WATSON said that if public utility under-takings abroad would benefit&apos;from our Governments proposals, it should be remembered that in this country nearly 50% of the gas produced was used for industrial purposes, for furnace and other work.   ^In places like Sheffield the proportion might be more than 50/i.    Probably this was also the case abroad.   Again, if foreign railways benefited, and could bring down their rates, that would help industries abroad.    Co that anything which would assist the railways and the public utilities in foreign countries to reduce their prices would certainly affect industry, it would appear, and would of course increase competition with ourselves.    He was not suggesting that iron and steel should not have rating relief or that export coal should not have it, but that these particular branches should not be concentrated upon and the other industries, many of which are in a bad position, left out.    Then, if there was to be discrimination, it would be a difficult task to trace where every ton of coal went.THE PRESIDENT said that it would be a very easy thing both for the railways and the collieries to work to a system of rating relief upon coal going for export, bunkers and steel works.    That might be taken as certain.   But it would be quite impossible to discriminate, in the mass of cases, between coal going into industry generally and coal going into domestic consumption.      It would not be difficult in the case of concerns
RAILWAY RATES ON COAL (CONTD).which placed large orders with collieries and bought direct, or through large factors who could place the order straight through from the colliery to the factory.     But when one came to the small industrial users who bought from a coal merchant or factor one could not distinguish between industrial and domestic coal either by the character of the coal or by the deliveries made.     Therefore, if the coal for small industrial users were brought in you would have to bring in domestic coal as well. And he was pretty certain, that if relief was given on railway rates for coal coming to London, the middle man would get it and the consumer would not.     Again, there was a limited amount of money to use in this way.     The big relief which industry generally was going to get was in its local rates, and not in the small amount that would come off the railway freights. If the railway rating relief was spread over the whole of the coal industry, it would work out at something like 4d. a ton all round, shared out, if it was to be shared, between the coal owner presumably, the middle man and the buyer, according to the haggle of the market.     Therefore, the actual amount of relief through coal that ordinary industry,- which was not a very large user of coal in proportion to its total charges,- would get out of the scheme would be very small.     On the other hand, if the relief was concentrated upon coal for export and steel works a much larger remission of railway rates could be given, -something in the region of 9d.SIR DAVID MILNE WATSON said that it might seem strange to find him holding a brief for electricity, but electricity was made in this country by means of coal, and that Industry would, no doubt, be entitled to relief if the gas industry got it. Anything in the nature of 9d would enable the price of gas to be reduced by about Id per 1,000 feet.THE PRESIDENT said there was no question of the gas Industry getting a relief of 9d per ton of coalj there might be a question of their getting a share of 3d or 4d on an average.     Gas con-cerns with a long haul for their coal might get 5d and those with a short haul 2d.MR. MITCHELL remarked that Sir David Milne Watson seemed to take It for granted that the reduction of railway rates was to be passed on, but he himself understood that the reduction was to be in relief of the coal trade, which was suffering so seriously.     The coal trade would propose to retain the reduc-tion as far as possible, which was only reasonable In the circum-stances.     As far as coal for export was concerned, the price at the present moment was made by coal owners not by the consignees; the industrialists abroad would get no reduction In prices. There was no doubt that a large reduction of railway rates for export would help to relieve the coal trade in its very unfortunate position, and it could not be expected to pass on all the relief it got.w2&quot;
LORD GAINPORD stated that It was desired to knock Polish Silesia out of a market which was normally our own.   That was why most of the British coal-owners hoped the Government would see its way to concentrate upon the export trade and the iron and steel industries.SIR DAVID MILNE WATSON asked whether, if there was discrimination, it would not be very difficult to decide what industry really wanted help most.   He did not know whether the cotton industry used a great deal of coal, but surely it was in    I need of help,MR. WARHAM stated that the cotton trade used very little coal in comparison with the iron and steel industries.ITHE PRESIDENT observed that the coal for the cotton trade I required only a short haul, being brought from neighbouring pits, i and the railway rates must, be only small.SIR KENNETH STEWART said that as   far as he could work it out in a theoretical fashion, the relief which would be afforded i to the industry, even if the whole 9d were granted, would be so minute as to be practically negligible.THE PRESIDENT presumed that what the cotton trade was looking forward to was the big relief from tne local rates.SIR KENNETH STEWART agreed.MR. LEE considered that, nevertheless, the amount of relief  1 from railway rates would be a fairly important matter for the cotton trade.    In a firm like his which used something like 300,000 tons a year, it was something to be considered.LORD GAINPORD desired to emphasize the point that, whilst the supply of coal to our home industries was In the same position as It had been in 1913, we had lost the export of 30,000,000 tons a year of coal to markets abroad.     Other nations had been increasing their exports of coal, whilst we had lost so much of ours.        Therefore it appeared to be very important to our country and to its coal trade that we should recover our national markets abroad which really belonged to us-.     As had already been stated, our strongest competitor at the present moment Was Polish Silesia.       The coalowners there were now asking for their coal a price from their own domestic customers which was leaving them a substantial profit, but their Government were also subsidising their coal for export to the extent of 5/- a ton on the railway rate -to Dantzig.     All that coal which was now being shipped by Polish Silesia, our great competitor which wasCONFIDENTIAL. RAILWAY RATES ON COAL (CONTD).
CONFIDENTIAL.RAILWAY RATES ON COAL (CONTD.)undermining our normal markets, was sold at a loss, but they somehow felt that they had to work to supply the world with coal, and try to knock other people out.   Well, there must be a limit to that policy, and the people of Polish Silesia must eventually see that they could not continue subsidising their coal owners, who were still losing money, by paying enormous sums to their railway companies to carry commodities 500 miles at the rate charged in this country for seven or eight miles. It did &quot;not seem to be an impossible thing for us to bring home to the Silesian coal owners that they could not continue to compete with us in the markets which were nomally ours.But it was from the national point of view that we ought to look at this question and not merely from the point of view of a particular trade.     We possessed in this country the best shipbuilding ports in the world and a comparatively uniform climate.   We had got, therefore, an opportunity of building ships which no other country possessed.     We had got men who loved shipbuilding, and we had also got a sea-faring population of a quality better than any other nation in the world.   With those great assets it did seem to be vitally important that we should try to secure increased exports from this country, and coal was the article for export trade which was better, probably, than any other commodity.    If we only secured an increased export trade in coal, that would re-act on trade all round;   it would help not only shipbuilding, but the iron and steel industry, and it would help the building trades indirectly, because one industry depended upon another.COAL.MR. WARHAM observed that the weekly output of coal in the United Kingdom for the two weeks ending June 16th was in each case considerably under the 5,00p,000 ton mark, and, leaving out the Whitsun holidays, was less than in May, being only 88.2$ of the March 1935 weekly average.   The number of persons employed was 81.7$ of the March 1925 average and the percentage of unemployed in May was 21,1% as against 17.9% in April.   The exports of coal from the United Kingdom in May, however, were considerably improved, being 4,500,000 tons as compared with 3,700,000 tons in April, although the value was 2d. per ton less than in April,   This difference in- tonnage was represented by increased demand from most of the large importing countries in Europe.   The improvement in demand from Germany mentioned the previous month still continued.    One other encouraging feature was that the export of coal from Germany in May showed a decrease, being 1,665,000 tons as compared with 2,082,000 tons in&apos;April.     On the other hand the export by sea from Poland showed a large increase, being 637,000 tons in May as against 529,000 in April.    This May shipment constituted a record for sea shipment from Poland.
C OHFIDBNTIAL.COAL (contd..).Although the inland consumption of coal in this country had now very nearly regained its pro-war volume, it was clear that the foreign export was alarmingly lesB.   The total export of the United Kingdom was very much below the 1913 standard.    In 1913 the total Quantity for export and bunkers for foreign going steamers was 94,000,000 tons, while last year the comparative figure was 68,000,000 tons, and so far as we had gone this year we were shipping at a still lower rate -about 30,000,000 tons Isbs than in 1913.    That was the alarm-ing part of the whole thing.    The whole loss now seemed to be on the export trade.    Of course the ooal trade was looking at this just now very seriously, because things were getting desperate.   Various schemes were being adopted in the districts to deal with the situation, but none of them seemed likely to increase the export of this country as a whole.   Neither the Welsh nor the Soottish scheme aimed at increasing exports at all, but merely at preventing prices falling still further, which was also the case with the scheme in Horthumberland and partly so with that in Durham.    The Midland Counties schema was designed to increase the export from their district, but as things were at present it could only do so at the expense of the rest of the British coal trade.    It seamed to them in the North that nothing short of a national scheme among all British coal owners could be of any possible use.With regard to finance, it was significant that every district, with the one exception of a very small inland district, showed a big loss upon their workings in April, and in some cases the loss had to be described as crippling.    This should have some effect in bringing about an understanding between the districts and in helping them to come together.THE PRESIDENT expressed the view that, whatever defects there might be in the existing local schemes - and he did not quite agree with Mr.Warham as to the effect of their competition in the export trade, since there had actually been a oonslder-able increase in the aggregate exports - the first step towards a national scheme was to have organisations in each area which could negotiate with one another on behalf of their respectiv e districts.    On that ground he did not want to discourage the area organisation, even If they were not ideal in themselves.LORD GAINFORD said that,  speaking of his own experience in the North of England in regard to the coke trade, several blast furnaces in the Cleveland district had been blown out during the month of June and the demand for coke at the West Coast furnaces had also been reduced.    The price of unscreened coal for-shipment had not been maintained and large screen steam was practically unsaleable.
IRON AND STEEL.MR. BONi) mentioned that the figures of production for June were not yet available, but there did not appear to be any general improvement in the pig iron and the heavy iron and steel trades, or any improvement, in prospect.   The imports of iron and steel for May were 23V,000 tons, the lowest figure since the coal stoppage, but still 50,000 tons in excess of the monthly average of 1913.    So long as these imports continued, works would continue to be short of orders and. their coetB of production increased by the fact that they were partially idle.    Many of the large iron and steel works were working from hand to mouth.    At the meeting of the International Steel Cartel on June 26th, the production quotas for the third period were continued unaltered, but the Germans maintained the attitude that the Cartel must be supplemented by international selling syndicates.   The United States Steel Corporation and the Bethlehem Company had formed an export oompany, and for certain steel products all other manufaoturers in the United States would place their export business in the hands of that company.The tinplate industry and the sheet Industry had maintained an improved position as compared with six months ago.    Both industries were working full time today and were fairly well sold ahead at moderately remunerative prices.   As regards the tinplate industry, this position had been brought about by better understanding among manufacturera.      Production was by common arrangement controlled so as to balance demand.   They were not likely to be able to maintain full production during the autumn, but it would be on a higher level than last year.    In South America the Welsh industry had regained a very large proportion of the trade which was lost during the coal strike. It was interesting to record that in 1926 the United States did 42$ and wo did 58$ of the combined export of the two countries in 1927 they did 36$ and we did 64$, and today our figures were coming towards 70$.    The better conditiom of the sheet and tinplate industry had been very helpful in South Wales,   The conditions there, not only in the tinplate and sheet trade but also in the steel works, were very much better than they had been six months ago.LORD GAINFORD reported that the makers of Cleveland pig iron had so far been able to maintain their fixed price , but only because they had vigorously restricted output and carried little or no stock.   Further restriction of the make had now taken place.   Hematite pig iron could relate no better experience.    On the East Coast two furnaces were said to have been blown out, and stocks had probably got higher.   On the west Coast the stock of hematite was also rapidly increasing and furnaces were likely to go out of . blast.
9 ^ q;IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.).MR. PUGH wroteJ-BNo material improvement has taken place in the volume of employment, either in pig iron or heavy steel production,    on the contrary, on the North East Coast the number of steel producing furnaces and rolling mill plant in operation has been further curtailed,&quot;There is said t0 be a slight improvement with regard to the trade in semi-finished products, the disadvantage of Continental competition not being quite so evident.&quot;In the tinplate trade conditions continue to improve, and the prospects for the next few months  aro good.&quot;The galvanised sheet trade has shown a slightly upward tendency, both as regards the price of the oommodity and the number of mills in operation.&quot;NON-FERROUS METALS.SIR CECIL BUDD wrote:-&quot;Since last month business in the non-ferrous metalB has continued on unaltered lines, with perhaps some greater signs of occasional activity than during the months of April and May.   This applies particularly to certain branches of the lead and copper industries, as well as to tinplates and galvanised iron.   There is, however, no sustained activity in any of the markets and business continues to be essentially spasmodic.&quot;ENGINEERING.MR. KICHMOND had little change to report in marine engineering and stated that contracts still continued very scarce.   The placing of the new Canadian Pacific steamer on the Clyde with the Fairfield Company and the re-engining of the &quot;Empress of Canada&quot; by the same firm, together  &quot;with the intimation of the placing of the Whito Star liner at Belfast, were the only bright spots on an otherwise dull record.   There waB one Canadian liner still to be ordered, and to whichever district it went it would certainly be very welcome at the present time.    There was really no demand, nor any orders being placed, for general cargo-carrying vessels and the yardB were fairly busy %\iat now completing the orders in hand.   These were being launched and completed at a rate about equivalent to pre-war years. The output in Scotland up to the end of May had been in fact above the average for the period in tonnage - 122 vessels of 272,000 tons.
ENGINEERING (CONTD.).On the North East Coast there was some activity in internal combustion engines, but there again there was no improvement in the demand for new tonnage, although a fair amount of repair and replacement work was going on.   Various shipbuilders and marine engineers had recently pointed out that there was little probability of prices going.lower and that shipowners would be well advised to bring their fleets up to date under present favourable conditions, even although the freight market at the moment was rather discouraging. Whether that had had any effect or not he could not say, but it was very encouraging that the number of enquiries during the last month had very substantially increased, and If a normal proportion of these materialised as orders then the Industry would be in a better position than appeared at the beginning of the year.In Scotland business in general engineering remained fair.   Machine tool makers reported some improvement, as did also constructional engineers, and there was the usual activity which prevailed in most establishments preparatory to the holiday period.    There had been a distinct increase in the enquiries during the last month, which were nearly all of a good class, and probably about 50% of them would materialise.SIR ERNEST PETTER wrote:-&quot;The position in engineering in the past month, as in industry generally, seems still be be hanging fire.    hesitation-tion as to mometary conditions and other factors has minimised the volume of new business coming forward.&quot;The chief feature in the latest available statistics, in respect of the month of May last, was the gratifying Improvement Bhown in the foreign trade figures for the heavy Industries.   The amount of coal exported was surprisingly good in relation to preceding months.    In the case of iron and steel and manufactures thereof, the tonnage Imported fell still lower towards normal level, while the exports,with the exception of March, were better than.In any month since November of last year.    Machinery imports fell from 8,800 tons in April to 7,500 tons in May, the corresponding figure in May 1927 having been 10,100 tonB,    Exports of machinery in May were very satisfactory, amounting to 50,031 tons, as against 44,062 tons in April,   The total tonnage exported in the first five months of this year now aggregates 238,971 tons.   This is the highest total for that period in any post-war year, and is 83.6$ of the tonnage exported in the corresponding months of 1913.&quot;While the average value per ton of the exported maohinery remains relatively constant, that of the imports, constituting as they do a much smaller volume of trade with greater alteration in composition, fluctuates more from month to month.   The mean figure for May was  181.9 as against  165.8 in April.   The principal decreases in the amount of machinery imported in the month of May occurred in agricultural
ENGINEERING (CONTD).machinery, metal-working machine tools and prime movers, but there were Increases in the Importation of electrical machinery and textile machinery, which are relatively higher-priced. Asregards exports, the largest Increase in May as&quot;&quot;compared with April occurred In the miscellaneous group, with notable advances also for boilers and boiler house plant, electrical machinery and prime movers&quot;It is notable that German exports of machinery in the first quarter of this year are stated to have exceeded the exports of the similar quarter of last year by some 30/2* The corresponding figure in the case of British exports of machinery is 22%, The home prices for all classes of machinery in Germany have recently been increased, and at the same time more export orders have been booked in regard to textile and paper machinery,&quot;The unemployment statistics show that the general position is one of slightly Increased unemployment.     While the index for general engineering, which accounts for fully 75/5 of the total of the engineering Industry, fell from 9.8$ to 9,6%, the figures for each of the other principal branches, electrical, marine, and constructional, show increases of one or two decimals.     On the whole, it may accurately be said that the employment situation in the engineering trades has steadily, although slightly, improved since the termination of the coal stoppage.&quot;Some progress towards the stabilisation of wages Issues has been effected, first by the resolution passed at the A.E.u. Conference at Southport in favour of the principle of payment by results, and urging the conclusion of a national agreement with the employers on these lines;    and, secondly, by the acceptance on the part of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades of the offer of 3/- wages advance made by the shipbuilding employers.        There still remain, however, more or less important Unions outside the Federation which have not yet signified their acceptance.&quot;MR. BROWNLIE wrote&quot;The situation in regard to the engineering industry has not materially changed since the last meeting of the Council, but it may be Interesting to you to know that the executive representatives of the Unions connected with the Engineering Joint Trades Wages Movement met on the 27th June to consider reports of their respective executives in regard to the reply of the Engineering and Allied Employers&apos; National Federation   -15th March, 1928 - to the Unions application for an advance in wages of 8/- per week and corresponding Increase in piece-work prices. Arising out of considerations thereon, the Conferencepassed the following resolution:-
ENGINEERING- (OONTD).&quot;That this conference appoint a small committee for the purpose of making investigations with regard to the position of the various sections of the engineering industry, also with reference to Trade Union organisation and other matters in relation thereto, and to report to a further conference of Executive representatives at the earliest possible date.&quot;&quot;This means that the committee appointed will consider various sections of the industry, e.g. electrical, constructional, and the ^otor-car industry, with the view of ascertaining if those sections of the industry are sufficiently prosperous to warrant an advance being conceded to the workpeople.&quot;ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES.SIR PHILIP NASH wrote:-&quot;I have really nothing to add to the statement made by me at the previous meeting. Orders continue to came in very slowly, and I see no immediate change in the prospect of activity in the electrical industry,&quot;COTTON.SIR K. STEWART said that the last Month had been very quiet.     There had been a rapid rise in price of cotton goods owing to the increase in the prices of raw material.     Certainly there had been no improvement in margins as far as could be judged from the actual lousiness that had gone through.     There had latterly been great attempts to improve the margins in favour of spinners and manufacturers, but not much business had gone through at those improved margins.     There had been a great deal of Inquiry from India and same business must have gone through, but it had not been very large.     Eastern merchants generally, however, felt a little more hopeful for the future.     With regard to India the difficulty always lay In the fact that the same number of firms were trying to do about half the amount of business they were doing ten or fifteen years ago, and the result was that competition was causing weak selling both In India and in Manchester. China had been quiet in regard to orders, but spot prices were reasonably good and business was rather hopeful. With regard to most other places, there had been rather a sag throughout the whole month. &apos; A certain amount of sundry business kept coming along, but it was below the average.     The volume of inquiry-, however, was considerable and next month ought to see an Improvement.
COTTON (CONTD.).The steady rise in price that was going on was favourable for margins all over the world and was encouraging to native merchants abroad and others, and was not altogether an unfavourable point for the future.    If profits could be made in the present there was come hope that they would improve.    One favourable point during the past month was the placing of a number of orders that had been held up pending the settlement of labour disputes.     There was still the dispute at Nelson, however, and while most of the others were out of the way there was always some fear that new ones vyould arise.MR. LEE agreed with Sir Kenneth Stewards report, except that they, on the producing side had found fewer inquiries than sir Kenneth on the selling Bide.    It might be that the inquiries had not come through to the producers, or that the shippers had taken the orders and were sitting on them until prices were cheaper.     The producing trade was no better off than last month.    In the spinning trade at the present time they were fairly clear of disputes and the dyers were getting settled up.     The Nelson dispute of course, was not a big one, but it was a very important one for the fine trade and it might go on for months.    There was a possibility that it might last the year, or it might be settled very quickly.   The price of Egyptian cotton was higher than it ought to be, taking account of the report on the crop and of the stocks, and of the fact that the Egyptian Government were themselves holding something like 48,000 bales of cotton that they were very anxious to sell. There was no doubt that the price of Egyptian cotton was keeping buyers out of the field.    If Egyptian cotton could once be got on to a basin that people felt was safe, then the trade would come back again.    In that trade, which for &amp; good many years past hod worked fully, there was now a certain amount of short time, but it was largely in the way of extended holidays.      It was not organised short time, but, if the trade continued as it was for another two or three months, then there would be general short time in that section.Discussions were continuing as to combination in the coarse trade, but they did not seem to be progressing hopefully.    In. Mr. Lee&apos;s opinion, however, the coarse trade would not be able to get into a healthy condition unless big. combinations could be formed which could extinguish the inefficient mills and put the trade on to a proper paying basis.The export of yarn to Holland and Germany had largely fallen off.   He thought, however, that the German trade would recover and that the present falling off was simply a matter of holding back on account of price.     Germany was using yarns and we should increase our export after a month or two.    There was no doubt that even the trades that were not permanently affected by competition from the East would have to show patience.    They had been quite used in the past in many lines to run for two or three months or more piling up stocks, and, although at the present time they daredCONFIDENTIAL.
COTTON    (CONTD.).not pile up stocks to any great extent on account of the value of the material, he felt sure that in the finer classes of goods it was only a matter of patience and the trade would come back.Mr. Lee had had two indications lately that were favourable to this country.    One was that the work-people in Prance were beginning to object to working longer hours than those obtaining in England.    The other concerned the competition from the mills in the Southern States of America. They had put up an enormous number of mills there, which were working two shifts of 60 hours each, and in the class of yarns they were producing we ^ere absolutely unable to compete, even though in a great many other ways they were at greater expense.    Mr. Lee had heard that there was a movement to do away vrith the night shift and, if that move-ment spread and the working was reduced to one shift, it would enable us to compete in South America, Canada and Australia.WOOL.MR. AYKROYD wrote:-&quot;Since the Advisory Council Meeting in June there has been an entire absence of business in the textile trade. Indeed the statement which was reported some months ago, that the buyers of cloth and hosiery goods had bought more than their requirements in anticipation of higher prices, has been fully justified by recent events.    This not only applies to our home trade but it applies to the export trade, particularly Germany.&quot;In the Bradford area combing machinery has run steadily in the same proportion as during the last two or three months with undoubtedly a larger proportion to stock. The came applies to spinning; and now firms are faced with the alternative of either running more into stock or curtailing production and adopting a further period of short time.    This latter course is getting more general and all sections of the industry - Leeds, Bradford, Halifax, Dewsbury, Guiseley, and the lower section of the Huddersfield trade, are looking for new orders, the placing of which is very problematical, and as far as one can judge until a new keynote indicating the basis of values for another season is struck, it is more than doubtful whether any alteration will present itself.&quot;The standardizing of the franc is looked upon as a step in the right direction for the assistance of 3ritish trade, for it nlll undoubtedly raise the cost of production in France and will then bring that cost to a nearer basis to our own; and until the cost in Europe generally assumes a proportion nearer to our own we cannot hope for any general improvement in trade,    and   we   shall   only   have spasmodic   outbursts   which   are   the   result   of   a favourable position being obtained through speculation.
WOOL (CONTD.).Time alone can bring this about and unfortunately large numbers of firms are finding it exceedingly difficult to wait until this oomes.&quot;No Continental markets are operating at the moment. -Our home trade is in the position of being between seasons, so taking all together we have an exceedingly quiet time in front of us following a long period of cessation of business&quot;.ARTIFICIAL SILK.MR, ALDISON wrote&quot;As regards artificial silk, the conditions generally remain the same, and there are no fresh features which call for special comment,&quot;CHEMICALS.MR. HILL considered that the elfin3cal market in the home trade had been without any particular feature recently, such changes as there had been being on the favourable aide, business being steady both in volume and as regards prices.   As forecasted a month ago, the overseas trade for June had been well in advance of that in 1926-1927, there having been noteworthy expansions in dyes, intermediates, and painters&apos; chemicals.A chemical trade mission had reoently visited Austria, Hungary and Czecho Slovakiaj and in Austria, although German chemioals were very much In evidenoe, they were not in any way favoured and British chemicals, so long as they could beat competition, stood quite an equal chance with the German.    Austria appeared to be very friendly disposed towards british chemical products.    In Hungary they were definitely pro-british and, provided they could buy and pay for our products, there was a good chance of doing very good business.    In Czecho Slovakia American chemical products possibly came first, but British products were a good second as regards favour, and in that country an excellent market seemed to be coming along.GAS INDUSTRY.SIR DAVID MILNE WATSON reported that in the by-product market there had been a slight sag in prices except in the case of sulphate of ammonia, where the price had been
CONFIDENTIAL. GAS INDUSTRY (CONTD.).advanoed slightly.   The most favourable point about sulphate of ammonia was that consumption had increased generally in the world, which was very satisfactory in view of the large increase of the output of sulphate ammonia both in England and elsewhere.GENERAL TRADE,MR. MITCHELL reported little change in the coal trade in Scotland.   Shipments were keeping up fairly well, but prices were very low owing to the severe foreign competition. The demand for the home trade was very poor.    Some additional collieries had been shut down temporarily and there was a further reduction in the number of men employed.    The average loss in May was l/- a ton, which was greater than it had been in the previous month.   The steel trade was if anything worse and the works were not well employed.   There were still considerable imports from the Continent of steel plates and also semi-finished material, but very little pig   iron was coming in.    No basic iron came in in May and the&quot;quantity of foundry iron that came in was considerably reduced.The Liverpool Chamber of Commerce reported a serious setback since Easter in the export trade in general and particularly to South and Central America, for whioh no reason could be given.    At the moment in some directions there was an improvement, but this was attributable to the usual rush of orders, which had to be shipped before the close of the half year.   As regards coal, the Mersey ooal trade remained In a most stagnant condition for foreign bunkers, export, and shipments to Ireland.    As regards wool the Liverpool Chamber gave some details of sales at the wool auctions held from the 12th to the 19th June.    Over 51,000   bales were offered and 26.000 bales were sold.   The Home trade took over 12,000 bales, America over 8,000 bales and the Continent, 5,000 bales.    Some descriptions were somewhat neglected at below April parity; most other descriptions met with a ready sale, prices generally being about 5% lower.    As regards timber the import for June had been slight.    Consumption was very restricted, although there was some little improvement in the latter part of the month.    Prices showed a slight reduction.LORD GAINF0RD stated that the review of trade conditions which he v*ould have to give on behalf of the Federation of British Industries, was a jeremiad.   There was apparently no improvement and no indication of any early amelioration^ Taking the country as a whole, a falling off in orders had ooourred, with the danger that, when once contracts were worked off, others would not come along to take their place. Lord Gainford&apos;s advisers at the Federation told him that one of the main operative factors behind the stagnation
4 fCONFIDENTIAL, GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.).was the monetary position in America.   They had been consistently saying that it had had an unsteadying effect on the prices of international commodities.   The improvements in the American situation which they expected had not been realised, and the check imposed by the American Reserve Authorities on the growth of brokers1 loans and Stock Exchange speculation would tend to react on American business conditions generally and accentuate the recent international price disturbances.    It was that, as his   * advisers said, which was one of the main oauses for the present drop and sagging in our industry.THE PRESIDENT said that he would like to see that worked out in a detailed and considered statement, which he would submit to a critical examination.    It was an argument which had not found general support.   Lord Gainford promised to see whether such a statement could not be supplied by the Federation.LORD GAINFORD had to report that in the iron and Steel trades during the past month the situation had been far from satisfactory.   Low prices had failed to stimulate buying, whilst there were persistent attempts to depress values s.till further.    The only satisfactory feature was that foreign competition was much less acute than it had been for years past.   The condition of the cutlery trade was not uniformly good, although the volume of trade in outlery tended to increase, the improved trade being confined to only a few firms.   Manufacturers engaged, upon the production of high class, or specialised, linea appeared to be well placed.The hosiery trade had been dull during the month, even those engaged upon the production of artificial silk goods reported a slowing up.The position of the boot and shoe trade was far from encouraging, owing to the failure of the public to absorb the large stocks in the hands of distributors.The pottery industry continued to be dull, with,, a small Increase in unemployment and short time working in most branches.There had been a slowing up in work in the shipyards during the past month, new contracts being very difficult to obtain.    Little change was reported in the condition of the engineering industry in most areas.   The principal branches which had strengthened their position were those concerned with eleotrioal equipment, and artificial silk machinery. A slight increase in orders was reported by the machine tool makers, principally for new machinery installations at light motor oar factories.
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD ).SIR GILBERT VYLE thought that the very modest improve-ment that had been reported last month had not, generally speaking, been maintained.     In the Midlands, in particular, a&quot;number of firms were doing quite well, whilst others were exhausting their order books.     This was happening even in the same trade, sometimes.     Those&apos;firms which had launched out and spent money in altering the character of their products so as to do their best to induce nei? business, business which was to some extent protected from competition by reason of its novelty, were not doing so badly, but other firms which were occupied on more staple products, and were affected by seasons, were not at all in a good condition.     His own business reported improved business during the last month, both at home andabroad, but he could not discover any particular reason for that at all*     As to the reason for this absolute failure of our trade improvement to materialise, that again was a problem that escaped analysis.     One could advance a set of reasons to meet one case, and then they would not fit the next, and so on.THE PRESIDENT asked whether Sir Gilbert found from his knowledge of trade abroad, that there was a similar hold-up of domestic orders there.     What of Germany, for instance?SIR GILBERT VYLE said that there had been a bad slump In that country about six months ago, but from other causes. That was now passing away, however, and their sales figures were improving.     Of course.France was in a very bad way at the present moment, but her condition was getting better. On the other hand Spain - so far as those businesses were concerned with which Sir G. Vyle was personally Interested -was showing a tremendous activity, and so -rere Italy and Czecho-Slovakia; and there was also a very interesting   1 improvement in business coming from Norway, Sweden, Finland and other Baltic States.     Belgium   as also keeping up an Improvement, that is from the angle from which he viewed the condition of trade.     On the viho^e, the placing of orders on the Continent seemed to be improving and being built up from month to month.As regards some of the trades  n this country, a report from Leicester stated that the condition of the boot and shoe business there was continuing to be disappointing.    In hosiery not much, if any, improvement was ahovm, owing, they said, to absence of summer weather; merchants ?/ere overloaded with stock and were unable to unload.     In Nottingham the ex -perience of manufacturers in the principal textile trades was that the continued unsettled weather was having a disastrous effect on summer business.    In the lace trade they said that novelty goods, the new and better quality stuff, was holding its own and doing a good business, but they repeated what Sir Gilbert had just said, that the ordinary staple articles iiere being neglected.   Generally, they seemed fairly satisfied. The making-up tra&quot;e was also very sensitive to climatic conditions, and one manufacturer had reported that the weather, coupled with the commencement of the sales in the retail shops, had finished the summer season so far as he was concerned, and that unless something happened such as a period of con-sistently warm weather, he feared that there would be a period of under-employment for the operatives in the making-up trade.-is-
GENERAL TRADE (OONTD).LORD GAINFORD thought It clear that the public in this country were not buyers at the moment to the same extent as they had been, in many of these commodities, and retailers, in looking ahead, were not prepared to give orders at the present time, unless prices came down.SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE agreed.   Retail trade, in his ex-perience, was doing well In London, but not in all other centres.     There was no doubt that it was bad In the north, though good in the south.THE PRESIDENT remarked that the Co-operative Wholesale Society reported having good trade everywhere except in South Wales and on the Tyne.SIR GILBERT VYLE added that, as.regards foreign countries, he would not say that their buying power was increasing, but that they were placing more orders.     Their buying power might be the same and have hitherto been latent, reserved for some reason.MR. HOLLAND MARTIN mentioned that the figures of the Bankers Glearing House showed an increase both for the town and. the provinces for the first half year.     The increase in the town clearances was possibly due more to the very large number of new issues than to trade, and in the country certain industries had been doing a little better a short time back.     The general   feeling, except of course in the cotton and coal and some of the heavier industries, was that, though there had been slight falls, the general movement was , slightly upwards. The last month1s orders, however, hadnot been coming along so well and there was a slackness which had come earlier In the year than was to have been expected.With regard to the large number of successful new issues which had been made in the past six months, Mr. Martin thought that, though   some of the money had found Its way into industry and in building larger works, a good deal of it had been held on the Stock Exchange and did not represent new orders.        A certain amount of the money had come from abroad for some of the new Issues.Many of the large stores had been placing far larger orders than before, and he thought that these stores had been increasing their sales.SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE confirmed this view, and stated that the effect of the amalgamations of retail shops was to encourage the public to spend more money.     Such amalgamations were more progressive and the total amount of trade done was greater than before.
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.).THE PRESIDENT stated that with regard to the question of oapital issues, he proposed to have a very oareful analysis made of the Ibbuss during the last six months to see what proportion represented actual industrial enterprise.Retail Distributing Trade.SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE stated that in view of the criticism made by Mr. McKenna at the last meeting, he had broadened his review so as to cover the trade in the North as well ae in the South, through the assistance of the Retail Distributors&apos; Association whose membership extended to practically every important city in the North.   Therefore, in future his reports would represent trade in the principal stores and distributing houses in the North and South.Reports to hand from the North and from South Wales, showed that distress was being felt amongst the smaller retailers who had been compelled ever since the coal dispute to extend credit to their customers in the mining industries, in order that their custom should not be permanently lost. In many cases these retailers had not been paid by their customers for the credit to them during the dispute.   The. distributing trade in mining areas reported that the average fall in turnover as compared with the previous year was 12% on the month of May and 5% on the period from February to May, In these areas suoh departments as oarpets, hardware, dress goods, fashion goods, coat3 and costumes, blouses, soft furnishing and underclothing showed decrease in trade.   The distributing trade throughout the Midlands reported a satisfactory increase in trade of about 5$ over the corresponding month last year and at the same time the same volume of labour was employed.    In the distributing trade in$ outer London the turnover for the month was slightly down, but this was aooounted for by the occurrence of Whitsuntide week in the period and by the very variable weather.   The number of customers served was slightly less but practically no change had occurred in the number of staff employed. Stores situated on the coast reported an increase of turnover and also an Increase in number of people employed.The general trend in retail trade in the West End of London during the month had been difficult.   The better class trade had been fairly good, but the medium class trade throughout the distributing houses had not been satisfactory. This, it was thought, was due to the reduced spending power of the. public brought about by the mortgaging of incomes in the purchase of houses and furniture on the instalment system. People with incomes from  5 to  15 a week were buying homes on the hire purchase terms, and their furniture, pianos, gramophones and motor cars on the same plan.   The result was that during this year the purchasing power of the lower middle class public had been so mortgaged that there was not enough available purchasing power to show an increase in volume in retail trade.   At the retail stores this month, however, trade had opened up rather well, especially in London and in the better olass trade.
GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.).Co-operative WholeaalQ Society.MR, HAYHURST aent in information as follows&quot;The Grocery and Provision side of our business has had satisfactory sales in June, shewing increases over last year1a figures.   The   North-Eastern section of the country and also South Wales are still in a bad condition,and whilst sales of necessitous goods shew slight increases, other articles are receiving but scant attention.&quot;It may be interesting to mention that deposits in our Bank have been very satisfactory, most substantial increases in amounts being recorded in the case of individual deposits.&quot;Trade in the Drapery, Woollens and Boots Sections has been satisfactory.   Beyond this, I do not know of any point which I need mention.    Stocks all round have been of the usual quantity assooiable with the large volume of business they are oalled upon to meet.&quot;There has been a steady increase in the demand for foreign butter in the two principal importing countries, viz. the United Kingdom and Germany.   For the five months ended May of this year, the United Kingdom imported 296,602 awts., and Germany 170,000 cwts, more butter than In the corresponding five months of last year.   After a firm market for sugar, the position now continues quiet. Several British factories are now importing raw sugar. Wheat markets have shewn an easy tendency and buying has been limited.   Good rains have fallen throughout Canada, and reports of orop prospects appear to be favourable.   Supplies of home cured bacon have not been too plentiful, with a consequence that higher prices have ruled, whilst those for Irish Rolls have been somewhat easy.&quot;During the week ending June 23rd there was a drop of id. per lb. In London In prices for common and medium descriptions of tea, which drop, however, was recovered at the London sales the next week.   There had been a general Increase in the stock of unsold teas at home compared with 12 months ago but these stocks were very largely&quot; of commoner kinds, for which there had been a continued diminishing demand all round, and there does not appear any indication of a fall of prices in the coming autumn.   Home auctions of coffee had been offering ^smaller supplies than *.usual for the time of the year.   There had been no material change in prioes and the demand had been much quieter than antioipatec1 Kenya coffee, although only of ordinary quality, maintained full prioes.   A disquieting feature of the cocoa industry is the continued lessening demand at home. Last month was the seventh in succession which showed a decrease in consumption compared to 12 months ago.&quot;
----SHIPPING.THE PRESIDENT observed that His Majesty&apos;s Government had, he thought, made a very satisfactory agreement with the Italian Government about shipping discrimination.   We had beon able to act as a united Empire;   Australia and India, who were closely concerned, had left the negotia-tions in the Home Governments hands, authorising us to say that Italian ships would be made liable to a fresh survey in their ports under the British regulations, unless the Italians adopted a reasonable attitude on emigration questions.   The result was that, subject to a final ratification by the Italian Government, - and they were putting some new regulations into force, which was practically equivalent to accepting the position - we would have what was tantamount to complete national treatment in Italian ports for all our ships engaged in the emigrant traffic.   He thought that was very valuable for us in itself, but doubly valuable in that it might discourage other nations who were aiming at discriminating against our ships, and trebly valuable as providing an opportunity for the Empire to act together as one entity.MR.

RAILWAY   TRAFFIC.MR. HURCOMB wrote:-&quot;During the four weeks ended 24th June the decrease in railway receipts, compared with the corresponding period of 1927, amounted to  1,379,000, of which  364,100 was due to a falling off in the tonnage of coal conveyed and  378,900 to a reduction in the tonnages of other minerals and merchandise.   For the twenty-five weeks ended 24th June the aggregate decrease was  4,530,000, made up as follows:-Passenger train traffic .....    637,000Freight train traffics:-Merchandise &amp; Minerals .... 2,278,000 Coal, Coke &amp; Patent Fuel... 1,615,000&quot;The railway statistics for April showed in respect of passenger traffic, the same features as in previous months this year, viz, increases In cheap ticket travel and in the number of workmen conveyed.   The freight traffic In that month showed a decrease of 3,038,000 tons, or 11 per cent; coal, coke and patent fuel accounted for 1,659,000 tons and there were substantial decreases also in iron ore and iron and steel&quot;.EMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS reported that the unemployment figures during the month had been bad.   As compared with 2lst May they had increased by over 91,000.    The only good thing that could be said about them was that.the increase was almost solely among persons  temporarily stopped, and that the number wholly unemployed had remained fairly constant. If coal, cotton, iron and steel and building were excluded, he thought it would make a substantial difference to the figures.   Mr. Phillips handed in the following table showing the number of insured persons in employment. Naturally It had shown a further decrease.Table/

We could not secure from them any schedule of import duties on a low level which would benefit our own exports during a long term of years, but we had got them to abolish the preference they were giving to Russia over their northern frontier, and that was a favourable result for us.The President had had a letter from our Ambassador at Buenos Aires, who. had been rather gloomy during the last year about our manufacturers not having the right people on the spot as agents and representatives.    Sir Malcolm Robertson had now written in a much more cheerful strain saying that various representatives had come out to the Argentine on behalf ef seme of the biggest British exporters.     For instance, in the case of agricultural machinery a very genuine effort was being mado by a combination of British makers, and this was all to the good and very much appreciated out there.
AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR.. SANDERSON sent the following information -The 1928/29 wool clip was estimated at 2,462,000 bales, worth  60,000,000.     Last season&apos;s sales totalled  55,563,000 worth, and 63,000 bales were carried over.A ballot would be taken shortly in New South Wales to decide question of establishment, of a compulsory wheat pool in that State.     Satisfactory seasonal prospects were continuing over most wheat areas in the Commonwealth.There were good seasonal dairying conditions in all States of the Commonwealth.     Production of butter was decreasing in New South Wales and Victoria and Tasmania, but increasing in Western Australia,The Queensland Beef Industry Commission had recommended the establishment at Brisbane of a public abbatoir for domestic, interstate, and oversea killing controlled by a Board of Three.   The establishment of abbatoirs at other centres was postponed until the Board had been appointed.The South Australian 1927/28 vintage was estimated to have declined by 4,556,000 gallons or 28 per cent, as compared with last year.According to. an unofficial estimate, the Queensland 1928 sugar crop would exceed that of last year and approximate to 530,000 tons.The bank clearances in all capitals, excluding Hobart, in May last amounted to  183,767,618, compared with  193,169,545 in May, 1927.       From 1st January to 30th April last the clearances were  931,613,934 as compared with  961,660,568 for the same period in last year.The Development and Migration Commission had recommended a Federal fund for assistance to gold mining;     it was proposed to erect a factory at Sydney costing  100,000 for the manufacture of reinforced steel;   and an expenditure of  6,732,000 for public works and land settlement schemes had been approved by the British and Commonwealth Governments under the  34,000,000 Loan Agreement.INDIAN TRADE.MR. GORDON wrote&quot;The strike in the Bombay cotton mills still continues. This has in many cases helped to clear off the excess accumulation of stocks, and has to this extent not been an unmixed evil to the mills.     Stocks of raw cotton are still high, but the exports of this commodity, though not as high as
to u: wINDIAN TRADE  (OONTD.)two years ago, have now exceeded those of the previous season, the large drop in sales to the Par East being counterbalanced by larger sales to the Continent.   The larger carry-over represents the superior yield of this season&apos;s crop.&quot;The balance of trade in India1s favour for the month of May was 6,05 lakhs compared with 1,76 lakhs in May, 1927c Imports for the month were not very different from those of a year ago, but exports increased by 4,77 lakhs;    details are not yet to hand,&quot;in   April the chief features in India&apos;s import trade were the increases In value under rice, kerosene oil, machinery, iron and steel, motor vehicles, silk and artificial silk piece-goods.. A decrease took place under sugar, cotton,  (both raw and manufactured), and mineral oils.    The United Kingdom accounted for the.greater bulk of the Increase under machinery and mill work (36 lakhs out of 46 lakhs) and under Iron and steel (18 lakhs out of 28 lakhs)e      Canada supplied the greater number of the motor vehicles,  sending 1,220 vehicles against 1,813 by the United States of America and 273 by the United Kingdom,,    The silk increase was in piece-goods from Japan, while in artificial silk the United Kingdom shared the increase with Switzerland and Italy..   There was an entire cessation of imports of beet sugar,, The fall in imports of raw cotton represents a return to more normal conditions.      Last Year&apos;s imports of American cotton were quite unusual.    In manufactured cotton the United Kingdom and Japan sent yarn less in value by 18 and 22 lakhs respectively than in the previous year, while the fall in imports of piece-goods is accounted for by the Japanese trade.&quot;As regards exports from India there was a large Increase under raw cotton and wool, oil-seeds, and hides  (both raw and tanned), with decreases under rice, lac,., raw jute and manu-factured cotton.     The fall in rice  (1,90 lakhs) and raw&apos;jute (1,18 lakhs) accounts for the very low balance of trade in India&apos;s favour in the month of April.SOUTH AMERICAN -TRADE.MR. HOSE, wrote&quot;The latest official returns of the foreign trade of Argentina relate to the first four months of 1928,  and, in comparison with those for the corresponding, period of last year, again show considerable increases in the values of both imports and exports, although the visible favourable balance of trade is somewhat lower.   The actual figures (which represent &quot;real&quot; and not Customs values) compare as follows:-Imports Exports       Export SurplusJS gold $ gold jB go IdJanuary-April,  1928... 303,416,496 403,231,837       99,815,341 do. 1927... 267,336,788 382,724,576     115,387,788
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (CONTD.).The total quantity of Imported goods showed an increase of about 19 per cent, on those of last year, but the values rose by only 13% per cent.     On the other hand, the volume of exported produce declined, but, owing to the generally higher level of prices, the value showed the increase above indicated. Gold continues to flow into the country on a heavy scale, the total imports of the metal during the period January-April, 1928, having amounted to $80,863,780, against only $5852,551 in the first four months of 1927.     There were no exports of gold in either period.&quot;Commercial conditions in general remain satisfactory, and the greatly improved business situation continues to be reflected in a reduction in the liabilities involved in commercial failures.     At the same time, the total of bank deposits in the Republic has reached exceptionally high levels, and the Interest rates of the Banco de la Nacion have been reduced.     There has been a marked increase this year In imports of nearly every kind, although it would appear that British goods are barely holding their own in the Argentine market.     The ruling factor in any effort to extend sales in new directions is undoubtedly the question of price, although there are, of course, more or less permanent channels through which a steady trade passes in articles of reasonably high-grade   manufacture.&quot;The agricultural situation appears satisfactory, no old-crop supplies of maize were carried over from last season, so that the quantity available for export will be considerably reducedj   recent estimates have placed the total at 5,000,000 tons, or, say, 16 per cent, less than last year.     On the other hand, however, prices of maize, both in Buenos Aires and London, are to-day nearly 25 per cent, higher than a year ago. In the Bahia Blanca district, the nature of the harvest will depend upon climatic conditions during the ^next few months, but a good start has undoubtedly been made in the agricultural areas.     No signs are apparent of any marked improvement In the Importation of British goods into Bahia Blanca. the extensive market there for agricultural machinery is still held by the North Americans, and, to a smaller extent, by the Canadians.     Public works are urgently needed, particular-ly paving, drainage, and road-mending, but there Is apparently little.possibility of a more active programme being undertaken until the new President assumes office in October next.&quot;Business conditions in Brazil continue to show a favourable trend.     There is an increased demand for credit, but money rates remain comparatively low.     The President of the Republic has signed a Decree authorising the destruction of 25,000 contos of reis of notes of the National Treasury, utilising for the purpose the surplus realised on the 1927 Budget.     Exchange is well maintained at around the proposed new parity of the mllreis, notice of the application of&quot;which, however, has not yet been given.     In fact, it appears that there may be considerable delay before the various recon-structive    financial measures, preliminary to the definite legal stabilisation of the currency, can be fully carried out.     In the local Import markets, there has recently been in evidence an increased enquiry for British textile and other machinery, while available supplies of iron and steel and tinplate goods in Rio de Janeiro are stated to be insufficient to meet local requirements.     The textile industry In Sao Paulo Is still depressed, but general conditions there
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (CONTD).continue to improve.&quot;The official returns of Brazilian oversees trade for the first four months of the current year show that exports amounted in value approximately to  31,649,000, as compared with  26,577,000 in the corresponding period of 1927, while imports totalled  28,214,000, against  27,548,000.     There was thus a visible favourable balance of trade of  3,435,000, against an excess of imports last year of  972,000.     This return to a surplus of exports is a favourable consideration of great importance to Brazil, owing to the heavy annual remittances&quot;which have to be made in respect of interest on the foreign debt.     Moreover, the outlook for the Brazilian coffee export trade appears satisfactory.     Prices are high, and the resources of the Coffee Control Institute are adequate to secure efficient marketing.&quot;In Chile, there has been no important change in general business conditions since my last Report to the Council, but an increased commercial movement continues to be reported from the Northern Provinces, this being attributable to the continuance of active conditions in the nitrate industry. Further south, harvesting of the crops has been completed, and, generally speaking, results have been better than last season. The full revised Customs Tariff, which imposes a much higher scale of duties, came into effect on 27th April last, and it remains to be seen to what extent the import trade may be affected thereby.&quot;Production of Chilean nitrate of soda continues at a comparatively high level, and sales of the fertiliser from 14th April, 1927, to 15th June, 1928, reached the high total of 3,524,887 metric tons.     The Chilean Government, however, has expressed the opinion that something might be done to secure better conditions for the sale of the fertiliser than have obtained under the present free-selling system, and a Committee is at present engaged in studying the question of centralising sales and distribution in the consuming markets,&quot;Prospects for the Peruvian cotton crop continue satisfactory.     Most of the sugar planters report favovirably on the condition of the canes, and the local market continues &apos; firm in tone.&quot;The second Fair of Peruvian Industries was opened in Lima on 19th May last.     While both Lima and the Provinces were represented by a wide range of articles, the Fair was chiefly remarkable for showing the progress made by local manufacturers of textile goods.     The production of cotton goods, which formerly consisted mainly of drills, sheetings, and shirtings, has been extended to many classes of plain and fancy goods.     The exhibits of woollen and silk goods also showed considerable variety.&quot;The adverse forecasts regarding the prospective coffee crop current in Guatemala at the commencement   of the 1927-28 season have proved entirely erroneous, and it seems probable that total exports may finally approximate to 1,000,000 quintals, which could be regarded as a good average output, weather conditions have been quite favourable for the cominp crop on all the Pacific coast plantations, which constitute &apos; about 65 per cent, of the entire coffee zone.     Consequently,
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE ..( CONTD ).owners have good reason to expect an increase over last year*s production.     In general, the commercial situation is somewhat difficult, although there has recently Leon a slightly increase demand for credit.&quot;The general tra,r!e situation in Salvador has continued quiet, and it appears that merchants are ordering little merchandise, this being partly attributable to the &apos;setting-In of the rainy season.     The maize and bean crops harvested at the commencement of May were partially a failure, and the Government has temporarily removed the relative import duties, to encourage the purchase of supplies from abroad.     There are, however, Indications that a fair average coffee crop may now be looked for.&quot;In Nicaragua, the.rainy season has not yet set in, and this circumstance has retarded the blossoming of the coffee trees.     In consequence, the outlook for the coming season Is much less satisfactory than had been anticipated.        The Nicaraguan Customs receipts for the first four months of 1928 reached a record total of $1,156,000, which was greater than-the aggregate collections in many previous full years.&quot;in Ecuador, where business has been very dull for an extended period, there appears to have been a slightly better tendency, although there Is still considerable scope for improvement.     Entries of cocoa into the Guayaquil market during the period January to April 1928, amounted to 220,526 quintals, against 204,930 quintals in the first four months of 1927.&quot;General Obregon, the sole candidate for the Presidency of Mexico, was duly elect.ed   on the 1st instant.     The economic situation in the Republic is still difficult, and there appears little hope of an early trade revival, especially as the policy of the new President is understood to be as strongly nationalist as that of his predecessor.&quot;
