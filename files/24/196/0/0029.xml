TThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, iPrinted for the Cabinet.      July 1928.SECRET.G.P. 229 (28).The &quot;No-tax&quot; Movement in the Bardoli Taluka, Bombay.On the 4th instant I circulated to the Cabinet (CP. 215) a copy of a telegram 1 had despatched to the Viceroy in consequence of the newspaper reports of the serious situation in the Bardoli taluka.I have since received from the Government of Bombay a letter giving a report in extenso of this factitious agitation. As the letter is of considerable length, I have substituted for the first six paragraphs, which give in detail the history of the revenue settlement, the first part of the statement made by the Under Secretary of State for India in the House of Commons on the 9th July, which gives the same facts in shorter form.   The rest of the Bombay Government&apos;s letter is printed below in full.Below these extracts will be found more recent telegraphic correspondence. I would invite my colleagues&apos; particular attention to the Government of lndia&apos;s official telegram of 6th July, No. 1301 S., para. 4 of which indicates that Sir L. Wilson, his Members of Council and his Ministers were not unanimous as to the course to be pursued, but that the majority were disposed to resile from the firm attitude displayed in para. 15 of the letter of the 9th June ; and to the telegram which I sent to the Viceroy on the 10th July.BIRKENHEAD.12th July 1928.Extract from Statement circulated by the Under Secretary of State for India with the Official Report, Rouse of Commons, on 9th July.The settlement of the land-revenue assessment which has been in force in the Bardoli taluka of the Surat District in the Bombay Presidency (which has an area of 222 square miles and a population of some 80,000) being due to expire in July last year, the Bombay Government, in the ordinary course of their revenue administration, appointed an experienced Deputy Collector in the cold weather of 1924-5 to prepare proposals for a new settlement. The Settlement Officer submitted his Report to the Collector of the district in June 1925, by whom it was passed in the following November to the Settlement Commissioner, who in his turn forwarded it to the Commissioner of the Division in. May 1926. The Report reached the Local Government in August 1926, about a year before the new settlement was due to take effect. The result of the examination and re-examination by the officials mentioned was that the proposals of the Settlement Officer for an average increase of 30 per cent, of the current assessment were reduced by 1 per cent, to 29 per cent.Meanwhile, as the result of publication for criticism of the Settlement Officer&apos;^ Report in the taluka, objections to the proposals began to be received from the persons affected, and continued throughout the year 1926 ; and in February 1927 steps were taken to ventilate them in the Bombay Legislative Council, with the result that the Member of the Governors Executive Council in charge of the Revenue Department received in March 1927 a deputation of agriculturists from the Bardoli taluka and from the adjoining taluka of Chorasi (which was also under resettlement), headed by two members of the Legislative Council. As it transpired that the deputation, though purporting to be fully representative and having had several months in which to prepare their case, were not fully armed with figures in support of their contention that the proposed re-assessment was excessive, they were given time to produce these, and occupied two months in the process, and the documents containing them were thereupon sent to the Settlement Commissioner for investigation. In July 1927 the Local Government, having fully investigated the original Report with the criticisms of the Settlement Officer&apos;s superior officers upon it, the original petitions of complaint, and the case submitted by-the deputation with the Settlement Commissioner^ recommendation upon it, passed orders the effect of which was to fix the new assessment at an average enhancement of 20 per cent, on the old, as compared with the 30 per cent, originally proposed by the Settlement Officer. This was in July last year.Thus the Bombay Government satisfied themselves, after a more than ordinarily careful and prolonged scrutiny of the facts and circumstances, that the assessment2928       75   7.28
finally adopted erred.if at all on the side of leniency, and that its adoption would not prove burdensome to the inhabitants of the area. It should be borne in mind that, along with the resettlement of Bardoli, proposals were made and approved for the resettlement of the Chorasi taluka, which adjoins Bardoli, and the. conditions in which are precisely similar. The new settlement of the Chorasi taluka is at a slightly higher rate than that of Bardoli, but at Chorasi no serious objection has been raised and nine-tenths of the newly assessed land revenue due from Chorasi have already been realised in the ordinary course.In February 1928 Mr. Vallabhai Patel, the President of the Ahmedabad Munici-pality, who had embai\ked on the enterprise of organising opposition to the new Bardoli settlement, presented the Bombay Government with an ultimatum to the effect that unless they consented to reopen the matter and to institute a fresh inquiry he would advise the inhabitants to withhold, not merely the enhanced demand, but all payments of land revenue, and demanded compliance within a week. This demand the Bombay Government naturally declined to meet, whereupon Mr. Patel launched, with the aid of numerous friends and helpers, a systematic campaign, first to secure the withholding of payments due and secondly to thwart the legal consequences of default. By the middle of March it became clear that these efforts were successfully frustrating the first steps ordinarily taken in such cases by the revenue ^authorities, namely, the service of demand notices and the attachment of cattle and other moveable property, whereupon the Bombay Government decided to exercise the powers given them by the Land Revenue Code to forfeit occupancies and to dispose of land so forfeited to other persons, lands held by non-cultivating owners  money-lenders and others- being selected as the first objects of this policy. This process took time, and meanwhile Mr. Patel and his lieutenants were able to -consolidate their position, so that by the middle of April they had established a tyranny in the talnka, compelling the inhabitants to remain along with the&apos; cattle within their houses with locked doors to prevent seizure and attachment, and blunging extreme pressure in the shape of fine, threats, and boycott both upon any who showed a disposition to pay and also upon the subordinate revenue staff and village servants, if they refused to default in their duties. These methods were countered by the Government by the importation of fresh subordinate staff, and by the middle of May 1,600 acres of land had been forfeited and transferred to fresh tenants on the payment of occupancy price. Further, up to the end of May about Rs. 1^- lakhs of land revenue had been realised out of the Rs. 6j- lakhs due under the new assessment.Faced with the failure of their campaign, Mr. Patei and his friends then endeavoured to enlist all the resources of the Indian National Congress organisation throughout the country, and a little later several members of the Bombay Legislative Council resigned their seats to mark their sympathy. Meanwhile, with the arrival of the monsoon, communications in the taluka are, as usual at that period, interrupted. But the forfeiture of defaulters&apos; occupancies continues, and arrests and convictions are taking place where the law is being broken. The Government of Bombay are in consultation with the Government of India as to the steps to be taken to deal with the situation, and with the gross misrepresentation to which the action of the Bombay Government has been and is being subjected. Up to date the amount of land revenue realised is Rs. 1,38,000, and the amount still outstanding is Rs. 4,84,000.Extract from letter No. 7259 B 24, dated 9tli June 192S, from the Secretary to the (government of Bombay, Revenue Department, to the Secretary to . the Government of India, Home Department.7. I am now to turn to the history of the agitation subsequent to the introduction of the settlement on 1st August 1927. It may be pointed out that various complaints have been made against settlements in this Presidency during the past 15 years or so, but that when a settlement has been finally introduced the opposition has abated and the new assessments have been paid. This is the first occasion upon which an organised opposition has been set up, and the reason for this is in the opinion of the Governor in Council more of a political than of an economic character. The Government of India are aware that the Bardoli taluka was selected in 1921 by Mr. Gandhi for his experiment in Civil Disobedience. Even before that date the political situation in Gujarat had been unsatisfactory. In 1918-19 Mr. Gandhi, with Mr. Vallabhai J. Patel as his chief of staff, had organised a no-tax compaign in Kaira district, on the ground that the valuation of the crops of that year had been excessive.
In 1919 riots occurred in Ahrnedabad, in which considerable damage was done to Government property. In 1923 a campaign against the imposition of punitive police in the Borsad taluka of Kaira district; was organised and met with considerable success. Last year1 serious floods occurred in Gujarat, and although the Governor in Council does not wish to impugn the humane motives of the leaders of the Congress and the non-co-operation movement in Gujarat who organised relief measures with commendable promptitude and vigour, nevertheless it is a fact that they seized the earliest opportunity of making political capital out of their activities by impressing upon the people that it was they and not Government to whom the people should look in times of trouble. In this relief work the leading spirit was Mr. Vallabhai Patel, then President of the Ahmedabad Municipality, and he had the support of his brother, Mr. Vithalbhai J. Patel, President of the Legislative Assembly. It is thus apparent that there has been for the past 10 years or more a distinct anti-Government movement in Gujarat, and that it has to its credit some striking successes. This being so, it is not surprising that when it became clear that the people of Bardoli were restive under the new settlement, an opportunity of again injuring Government presented itself to the popular leaders. They were not slow to avail themselves of it. That their motives were political, and the economic grievances of Bardoli taluka were a secondary consideration, is proved by the fact that whereas the Bardoli and the Chorasi settlements were prepared at one and the same time, the conditions of the two talukaff were precisely the same, only with this difference that Chorasi is more heavily assessed, and the people of Chorasi had identified themselves with those of Bardoli in making representations in regard to the settlements, nevertheless this campaign was organised in Bardoli taluka alone, and Chorasi was left out. The result has been illuminating. The land revenue demand of Chorasi under the new settlement is approximately Rs. 3 lakhs, and Lip to date all of this with the exception of Rs. 11,000 has been recovered without any difficulty. It is evident from this that the people of Bardoli were able to pay their land revenue, and that if they had been left to themselves they would probably have done so. The economic argument that they cannot afford to do so is completely ruled out.8. Mr. Vallabhai Patel and his lieiitenants took the field at the beginning of February, and on 6th idem he addressed an ultimatum to Plis Excellencv the Governor to the effect that if Government were not prepared to reopen the Bardoli settlement and to make a fresh enquiry into it he would advise the people to refuse to pay not simply the extra assessment due on account of the revised settlement but no land revenue at all. He demanded compliance with his terms within one week. It was. obvious that this Government could not accept dictation of this character, particularly as the motives of Mr. Vallabhai Patel and friends were clearly exposed in the ultimatum. Had he based his demand on economic grounds, he obviously would have advised his friends to pay the old assessment which they had paid without-complaint for the last 30 years and would have endeavoured to reason with Government about the extra assessment. Instead, however, of doing this, he announced that if Government did not yield to his demand he would advise the non-payment of any revenue whatsoever. This Government accordingly gave him the only possible reply that one with any sense of responsibility could. A systematic compaign was then, inaugurated by Mr. Vallabhai and his friends to prevent anyone, however willing, from paying any portion of his assessment.9. The campaign was widely advertised in the newspapers and attracted attention in the Legislative Council which was then sitting. Had the numerous leaders of the opposition been united and approached this Government for a full dress debate, this Government would have welcomed the opportunity of putting forward their case in detail. As it was, the only opportunity that the opposition reserved for itself was in the last half-hour of the Budget discussion, and in this short time the Commissioner of Settlements and the Honourable the Revenue Member stared the Government position. The matter was pressed to a division, and the result was a victory for Government by 44 to 35 votes. It was anticipated at the time that this result would have some effect on the campaign. Its only effect, however, was to intensify it.10. To turn now to the measures taken to meet the attack. At the outset the district officials had confined themselves to serving notices on the cultivators and to attaching moveable property, such as buffaloes, but had met with little or no success. It became apparent by the middle of March that stronger measures than these were required, and as explained in this Governments telegram No. 7259 B of 22nd March
1928, it was decided to take-action under section 153 of the Land Revenue Code by forfeitures of occupancies and the disposal of land so forfeited&quot; to other persons. It was arranged that in the first instance the lands of capitalists, i,e; foanias and others who were, not. professional agriculturists, should be dealt with. The- process of forfeiture, however, took some time, and meanwhile the agitators were further consolidating their position. By the middle of April this Government desired the Commissioner of the Division (Mr. W. W. Smart) to take up his residence in Surat and to assiime personal charge of the situation. The Commissioner, on reaching Surat, found that Mr. Patel and his men had secured a complete grip over the taluka and had established a tyranny, the authority of Government for all practical purposes being in abeyance. People were compelled to remain inside their houses with locked doors to prevent the attachment of their moveable property by the officers of Government, and if they showed any disinclination to do this they were locked up in their houses for days together by the agitators, who had provided themselves with padlocks for the purpose. Cattle was either smuggled over the border into the Baroda State, which surrounds Bardoli taluka on all sides, or was kept locked tip in the houses. The few persons who were known to have paid their revenue were either fined by the agitators or boycotted or threatened with excommunication. The same threats were held out to the Patels and the inferior village servants, with the result that some of the former and all of the latter had to cease work. The normal life of the people was brought to a complete standstill.11. On the recommendation of the Commissioner this Government at once stationed extra establishments of revenue, magisterial and police, and the campaign against the agitators was prosecuted with greater vigour.It may at this point be useful to say something about the Pathaus, of whom the newspapers have made so much. The Vethias, or inferior village servants, had been compelled to cease work, and it was necessary to find substitutes, who would look after the cattle that was attached. The Collector accordingly obtained from a labour contractor in Bombay 25 Pathans, and these men were either kept in headquarters to look after the attached cattle, or were sent out in parties of five under the direct charge of a Mahalkari to make attachments. Only two accusations have been made against these men, and both have been shown to be unfounded. Their conduct has, in fact, been exemplary. The Pathan, however, is an object of dread to the urban population of Bombay, and it was evidently regarded by the agitators as an astute move to picture Bardoli as being at the mercy of ruffians from across the frontier. Accordingly, lurid stories were circulated, but, except amongst people who will believe anything about Government, have met with little credence. As this Government has pointed out in the Press, if the Vethias are able to resume their normal duties the necessity for the employment of. Pathans or any other labour from outside will disappear, and they can be withdrawn.12. By the middle of May the results of the Government measures were becoming tangible. At the outset of the agitation Mr. Patel, in no way deterred by the non-fulfilment of his prophecies in the course of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s campaign in Kaira district 10 years ago, stated that Government would be afraid to forfeit any land, and that if they did no one would dare to come forward and take up the occupancy. He also declared that no one would dare to purchase the cattle that might be distrained. He further stated that none of the land revenue would be paid. These declarations have been proved to be without justification. By the third week of May last no less than 1,600 acres of land, almost all of it belonging to bania capitalists in the taluka, had been forfeited to Government and after forfeiture had been disposed of to fresh occupants on payment of occupancy price. That is to say the original holders of this area have now irretrievably lost their land, and it has become the property of new persons. Further, to prove the inaccuracy of Mr. Patel&apos;s boast, many persons, Hindus, Mahomedans and Parsis, have come forward to take up any more land that may be forfeited, and at the present moment the Collector has a waiting list of such applicants. Then a certain number of cattle has been distrained, though the close proximity of the Baroda State enabled the owners to get a large number across the border. But here.again the boast of the agitators has been proved to be unfounded. It was stated that no one would come forward to buy cattle and moveable property which had been distrained, whereas as a matter of fact there has been no serious difficiuty in finding purchasers. Similarly with the collection of land revenue ; up to date approximately 1^ lakhs have been collected out of 6&apos;-t lakhs due.
13. Whatever the agitators inay say in public, they have hot deluded themselves in private in regard to the significance&apos;of these results, and it is evident that it was in consequence .of them: that somewhat suddenly in the middle of last month it was -announced that Bardoli had become an all-India question, arid the whole resources of the Congress were invited to help to deal with it.    It is  quite clear that if Mr. Vallabhai had been able to bring the campaign to a successful conclusion by himself, he would have done so.   But in view of the change in the situation more strenuous measures had to be employed.   Members of the Legislative Council were approached to resign their seats, and up to date eight of the Gujarat representatives have done so, apparently without any enthusiasm;  so also Messrs. Mariman and Balubhai Desai of Bombay and Mr. Bechar of Karachi.   These three individuals oppose Government on  any and every occasion, and consequently their action is without significance.   The members of the All Parties&apos; Conference, who were meeting in Bombay from 19th May onwards, were invited to Bardoli to take stock of the situation, amongst those who accepted the invitation being Dr. Ansari and Shaukat Ali, and eventually Mr. Vallabhai PateTs brother, Mr. Vitalbhai J. Patel, President of the Legislative Assembly, was induced to intervene in the struggle in a manner which is known to the Government of India and need not be repeated here.   Finally, a Minister of this Government approached His Excellency the Governor to intervene, the suggestion being that if the land revenue were paid Government would undertake to reopen the settlement.14. Although the attitude of this Government towards the agitation had been consistent throughout, His Excellency nevertheless decided that it would be desirable for the situation to be fully reviewed by himself and his Council and Ministers, and for this purpose he invited the Commissioner to come to headquarters from Surat -and to explain the situation at first hand. The Commissioner accordingly visited Mahableshwar at the beginning of last week, and attended a meeting of the Joint Council of Members and Ministers under His Exceliency&apos;s presidency. He gave a detailed account of the situation from the moment that he had arrived.in Surat, and offered it as his considered opinion that, provided that the attitude of Government remained unchanged, there was every hope that, as had happened in Kaira,in 1918, this agitation would collapse as soon as the rains set in in earnest. The Commis-;sioner&apos;s conclusion was the same as the one already formed by this Government, namely, that the invitation to the Congress and to every other element of Indian public life which is opposed to the authority of Government was a counsel of despair in consequence of the success of the measures which Government were taking to recover their lawful dues. He consequently deprecated any advances being made towards Mr. Vallabhai, as these would at once be interpreted as a sign of weakening on the part of Government. As a result of this discussion this Government resolved not to swerve from the policy which it had adopted from the start, though it. recorded its willingness to consider any representation that might be made to it by Mr. Vallabhai -and his friends. It is understood that this decision was informally conveyed to Mr. Vallabhai, but up to date he has given no sign that he is prepared to approach Government. This Government also took the opportunity to make its intentions known to the people of Bardoli, and on the 31st ultimo it issued an announcement in Gujarati and English (a copy of which is enclosed herewith0) in which it reviewed the situation up to date and announced its intentions for the future. This announcement -appears to have had some effect, as the Commissioner has just reported to Government that he has received a visit from Sir Purshottamdas Thakurdas, M.L.A., in which he sought to reach some accommodation between Government and Mr. Vallabhai. The Commissioner stated the Government position to Sir Purshottamdas, and that gentleman is now considering the position. Whether or not he will be able to -achieve anything, it is not yet possible to say.15. The situation must, however, continue to be viewed with anxiety. It seems probable that if the campaign continues the next step will be to endeavdur to prevent the lands which have been forfeited and then disposed of to fresh persons from being cultivated, and as a result violence may ensue. It is the plain duty of vany Government to ensure that the lawful owners of land are enabled to cultivate it, and if force is used it ,must&apos;: be.; met...by , force... The latest reported speech of Mr. Vallabhai, to the effect,,that the new Parsi landowners will find their land -manured with their own blood if they try to cultivate it is the appeal of a fanatic, and it is clear that if he continues to make speeches of this character action will have -to be taken against him.

Home Department. Reference to Home Department letter No. 1). 1851, 14th June,-&apos; forwarding Bombay letter of 9th June, regarding Bardoli situation Further letter dated 1st July has been received from Bombay, substance of which is as follows.2. Since letter of 9th June, situation in Bardoli itself has not undergone any serious change. With arrival of monsoon, communications in taluka are interrupted and situation for next three months has become one of stalemate. Meanwhile, forfeitures of land are being continued. No attempt will be made by Government to prevent cultivation of forfeited lands, but cultivators are being warned that they cultivate &quot;at their own risk, and that crop will be at the disposal of Government. Probability is that struggle will be resumeclwith undiminished energy when crop is-ready to be harvested.3. Public opinion, owing&apos;to predominant influence of Gujarat in Bombay City, has been mobilised against Government, and there has been unparalleled mis-representation of facts. Governor-in-Council considers no stone should be left unturned to conciliate public opinion, if this can possibly be done.4. On 29th June, Governor held meeting with his Council and Ministers Opinion of majority was that, in view of need of conciliating public opinion, Government should make an offer to cultivators, substance of which is as follows : They firstly pay up revised assessment for current year. Government will, next cold weather, appoint an officer to enquire into settlement, and, if necessary, make proposals for modifications.. Stress is laid on the condition that revised revenue must be paid in full before enquiry is made. Two members of Executive Council are opposed to this. They anticipate it will open door to similar difficulties in other taluka ; that it is exceedingly improbable that offer would, be accepted by Vallabhbhai Patel, and it would be regarded by leaders of agitation as capitulation on the part of the Government. The other members of the Government are convinced that in case of some of the members of the Legislative Council who have resigned their seats, there is genuine doubt as to-the correctness of the data on which reassessment was based, and they.feel that the position of the Government will be much strengthened if, when the Legislative Council meets, they announce willingness of the Government, provided increased assessment has been paid, to agree to fresh enquiry, to remove any doubt on the-subject. &quot;   ..* See CP. 215 (28).
5. If offer is to be made, proper time and place is in  he Legislative Council, next session of which begins 23rd July. Offer has been brought to the notice of the Government of India because it is realised that, owing to efforts of Gandhi and the President of the Congress, Bardoli question lias assumed all-India importance. Governor-in-Couneil is therefore anxious, not to take a step which will not be -acceptable to Government of India and has asked for early expression of views of Government of Bombay on the offer contemplated.6. Following official reply has been sent to the Government of Bombay :  &quot; (1) Before giving definite reply to the question asked in para. No. 5, Government of India would like to be assured that their estimate of the situation agrees with that of the Bombay Government. Government of India see. three alternative courses of action : first, the suspension of coercive processes, as contemplated by the Government of Bombay in para. 2 of their letter, cultivators, however, being warned that they cultivate at their own risk and that the crops will be at the disposal of the Government. Second, the rigorous application of distraint processes immediately supported by whatever force is necessary. Third,. coercive action against instigators of non-payment.&quot; (2) As regards first course, this seems to lead to great hardship on genuine cultivator, who is probably intimidated into refusal, and inevitable, though postponed, -danger of serious physical conflicts at termination of three months during which anti-Government forces will have gained strength and Government authority suffered proportionate damage.&quot; (3) Second course involves similar hardship to cultivator and may be prejudiced by climatic conditions.&quot; (4) As regards the third course, the Government of India recognised there were difficulties in dealing with instigators under ordinary law, though it would seem from para. 15 of your letter of the 9th June that some of them may from time to time render themselves liable to prosecution. Government of India have considered the possibility of taking action under Bombay Regulation 25 of 1827, but this does not seem to them appropriate for the purpose. If the Governor in Council feels, as the Government of India are disposed to feel, that it is desirable to attack the instigators directly, Government of India would invite their views on the advisability of issuing an Ordinance making the instigation to refuse payment of land revenue a penal offence, or supplementing, in such other manner as may appear necessary with this object, the existing law.&quot; (5) It is in the light of these general considerations that the Government of India have considered your letter. As to proposed offer, they would be reluctant to dissent from the considered judgment of the Governor in Council and Ministers, but feel strongly that if any such offer is made it should be accompanied by statement that unless offer to Government is instrumental in securing settlement, Government would be obliged to consider further action to secure compliance with law. Such further measures might include issuing of Ordinance on lines suggested above, but Government of India would not in any case propose that this possibility should be referred to at the time of making the offer.&quot; (6) Government of India would be glad to receive as early as possible observations &apos;Of Government of Bombay on this telegram. They desire to. add that, if available forces in Bardoli have to be increased, Government of India think it desirable that police should be utilised to the fullest extent possible before question of employing military force is considered.&quot;7. Reference to your telegram of the 5th instant, No. 1863, question in Parliament on Monday, we have asked Bombay to furnish you direct with information required, but in the circumstances explained above we suggest that, if possible, you should get the question postponed, or frame general answer in reply. No statement of the policy contemplated can. be made until we have received Bombay&apos;s reply, and you will realise the undesirability of any announcement which would either prejudice or anticipate statement that may have to be made by Bombay.Telegram from Governor of Bombay, dated 7th July 1928. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram dated 6th July, No. 1874. As Bardoli has ^assumed an ail-India importance and reactions on other parts would probably result on any action by my Government, I consulted Government of India and Viceroy privately at beginning of this week with definite proposals from -my Government.    I am expecting a reply at any moment.    Situation in Bardoli
serious, but reports in the Press on many points exaggerated. The King&apos;s writ is; running, and many have been arrested and convicted for offences against laws. Position is very difficult at present because of monsoon and interruption of communications owing to the flooded creeks. I have had Simon Commission much in mind in hoping to effect a settlement while maintaining Governments position. I am glad of your views on this, as I felt great responsibility about Commission. I fully realise importance of remaining firm and of demonstrating that Government can and will govern. My difficulties are not lessened by the fact that two of my colleagues are from Gujarat, but so far, with some pressure, they have continued determined to assert authority of Government.Telegram from Government of Bombay, Revenue Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated 7th July 1928.Your telegram of the 5th instant, JSio. 1863, to Home Department, and repeated to-Bombay.Situation in Bardoli fully described in our letter of 9th June, No. 7259, to-Government of India, which we are informed they forwarded to you by mail of 14-th.. Situation much the same as monsoon impedes further action owing to the difficulty of communications. Government have forfeited occupants of lands which have failed to pay their land revenue and are continuing-to do so. Such lands-are being disposed of to fresh occupants as opportunity arises. In case of land forfeited but not yet disposed of to fresh persons, no action is being taken to interfere--with cultivation, but cultivators are being warned that their crops will be seized when ready for harvest. In certain cases persons have been arrested and convicted of offences against the law. Bombay Government are in communication with Government of India as to further action necessary. Action of Government in distraining movable property and forfeiting and disposing of land has been subject of gross misrepresentations-tion, but Government have acted entirely with the law and in no vindictive spirit, as. alleged. Situation undoubtedly serious, but believed not to be so bad as represented in the public Press.

I have now had your Home Department telegram, of 6th July, Government of Bombay&apos;s telegram of 7th July, and letter of 9th June,, and your and Leslie Wilson&apos;s private and personal telegrams of 6th and 7th July respectively.   Although situation is doubtless not so bad as newspapers report, I recognise that he has great difficulties, and I do not wish to run the risk of adding to-them by official intervention.   But I must make my own x^osition plain.   It is with some anxiety that I note weakening in Bombay Governments attitude, between. 9th June and 29th.    I do not accept what seems to be view of Governor and Ministers that primary consideration is conciliation of public opinion.   Letter of 9th June leaves no doubt that Bardoli has been deliberately selected as field for trial of strength with Government by forces which for nearly ten years have aimed at bringing British Government to a standstill, and primary consideration, in my judgment, is to break this movement before it has gone any further and to show the whole of India unmistakably that no such attempt can succeed.   Letter of 9th June-shows how necessary this lesson is.   It is humiliating to think that prestige of British rule has sunk so low that any individual or body should dare to deliver to any British Governor ultimatum such as that described in para. 8.   But it seems to me that enemy have chosen their ground badly, for Bombay Governments case appears to be unchallengeable on its merits, and I can see no ground for weakening in their attitude-, or in departure from admirable sentiments expressed in para. 15 of their letter. His Majesty&apos;s Government will, I am convinced, expect Bombay Government to stand by these sentiments, and purpose of this telegram is to ask you to impress this upon them.I note activities of Congress in this agitation. Congress now.stands for complete&apos; independence and has recently established branch in London under communist auspices with Saklatvala, C. P. JDutt and other communists on executive committee. It is also affiliated to League against Imperialism which is imder communist influence... I suggest, therefore, that it should be treated as body whose objects are regarded by Government as illegitimate, that Government should no longer accept, and still less invite, its co-operation, and that its members, should be cold-shouldered socially. I wrote to you recently on question of drawing visible line between friends and enemies, and Bardoli lends additional point to my remarks.
2928B.. . Telegram from Viceroy, dated 11th July 1928.452 S. Private^nd personal. Your telegram No. 1904, dated 10th July. Bardoli. After some reflection I have decided to ask Leslie Wilson to come up here, and, failing that, shall send Home Secretary to Poona during the week-end. You may rely on me to do everything I can to assist Wilson and secure the position of the Government, but situation is by no means clear, and I would defer telegraphing my considered judgment till I have been able to see Wilson or receive Haig&apos;s report.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 12th July 1928.Private and personal. Bardoli. This matter was discussed at the Cabinet yesterday. 1 had already circulated some documents and am circulating all the telegrams and correspondence that have passed between you, Wilson and myself. The Cabinet, like myself, was much perturbed by the situation, as it is described to us. It seems to me that it might develop in a variety of ways. Have you a general plan of campaign to deal with the movement, and its possible extension ? Or have von alternative methods in your mind to meet the different contingencies which may arise ? We simply cannot afford to be supine in the matter or to acquiesce in an insolent assumption of the functions of Government. At present only a small part of the prairie has caught fire, but there are other and veiy inflammable prairies in the vicinity. I am sure that you are giving your mind most closely to this anxious business, but I beg that you will keep me constantly informed of the developing situation and of your own views in relation to it.I have just received your telegram of the 11th July, No. 452 S., upon this matter, and shall await your promised communication after you have seen Wilson.
