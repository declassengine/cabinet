This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentsPrinted for the Cabinet, July, 1928.SECRET. -  -Copy No.  2C.P. 24:7 (28).THE CABINET.FUTURE BRITISH GARRISONS IN CHINA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. At their meeting on 2nd May, 1928 (26 (28)), the Cabinet decided, inter alia, that : &quot; (d) The situation has now improved to an extent which permits the further withdrawal of two infantry battalions and the field company, Royal Engineers. These units should be brought away from China before July of this year.&quot;2. The very dajr after this decision was&apos;made, there occurred the Tsinanfu incident, when there was a serious clash between Japanese and Chinese troops belonging to Chiang Kai Shek&apos;s Army. This incident led to reprisals by the Japanese and, in view of the possibility of anti-foreign repercussions elsewhere in China, it was decided to postpone the carrying into effect of conclusion (d) above. The War Office telegraphed to the General Officer Commanding, North China Command, accordingly to this effect on 7th May. Since that date the British troops have been moved to the Tongshan mining area without any untoward result, and there have been no anti-foreign disturbances on the transfer of Pekin and Tientsin to Nationalist control. \3. In the opinion of my advisers the military situation is now such that the retention of as many as three British battalions in Chihli is unnecessary and I consider that the time has now come to implement the decision of 2nd May. This means that two battalions would be withdrawn during the early part of the coming trooping season, without relief, one from Shanghai and one from the area Pekin- Tientsin Tongshan.A very early decision is necessary in order that the trooping programme for the coming season may be finally arranged.L. W.-E.The Wak Office,20th July, 1928.(B28/17)   100   7/28   W.O.P.   3785
