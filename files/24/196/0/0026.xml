[&quot;This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.-Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1928.28CONFIDENTIAL, Copy No.CP. 226 (28).RENUNCIATION OF WAR.I circulate to my colleagues the draft of a note replying to the note from the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires of the 23rd June last.&quot;    .&quot;   &apos;  &apos;A. C.July 11, 1928.Sir,I AM happy to be able to inform you that after carefully studying the note which you left with me on the 23rd June, transmitting the revised text of the draft of the proposed treaty for the renunciation, of war, His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain accept the proposed treaty in the form transmitted by you and will be glad to sign it&apos; at suqh time and place as may be indicated for the purpose by the Government of the United States.My Government have read with interest the explanations contained in your note as to the meaning of the draft treaty, and also the comments which it contains upon the considerations advanced by other Powers in the previous diplomatic correspondence.You will remember that in my previous communication of the 19th May I explained how important it was to my Government that the principle should be recognised that if one of the parties to this proposed treaty resorted to war in violation of its terms, the other parties should be released automatically from their obligations towards that party under the treaty. I also pointed out that respect for the obligations arising out of the Covenant of the League of Nations and of the Locarno treaties was the foundation of the policy of the Government of this country, and that they could not agree to any new treaty which would weaken or undermine these engagements.The stipulation now inserted in the preamble under which any signatory Power hereafter seeking to promote its national interests by resort to war against another signatory is to be denied the benefits furnished by tne treaty is satisfactory to my Government, and is sufficient to meet the first point mentioned in the preceding paragraph.His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain do not consider, after mature reflection, that the fulfilment of the obligations which they have undertaken in the Covenant of the League of Nations and in the Treaty of Locarno is precluded by their acceptance of the proposed treaty. They concur in the view enunciated by the German Government in their note of the 27th April that those obligations do not contain anything which could conflict with the treaty proposed by the United States Government. The renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy is not at variance with the principle accepted by all members of the League that they will stand shoulder to shoulder in opposing those who disturb the peace of the world in violation of the pledges which they have given in the Covenant. In the cases where the Covenant calls for resistance to another State to be made for the common good, such resistance may involve warlike action, but even if this should be the case, it is not action which is intended to promote the national interests of the State; it is not &quot;as an instrument of national policy &quot; that war would be resorted to. The same may well be said of the obligations which they accepted in the Treaty of Locarno in order to further the cause of peace in the area of Western Europe, which has so frequently been the scene of European conflicts.The point dealt with in the preceding paragraph is perhaps academic. Acts of aggression which brought into operation the obligations incumbent either on 4515   [17937]
members of the League or on parties to the Locarno Treaty would as a rule involve also a breach of the treaty proposed by the Government of the United States, and ff would thereby deprive the State guilty of such action of the benefits of the new treaty. 5The point will become wholly academic from the moment when all members of the League and all the parties to the Locarno Treaty have become bound by the treaty for the renunciation of war.My Government have, therefore, noted with peculiar satisfaction that all the parties to the Locarno Treaty are now invited to become original signatories of the new treaty, and that it is clearly the wish of the United States Government that all members of the League should become parties either by signature or accession. In order that no question may arise as to the meaning and effect of the proposed treaty, and that as many States as possible may participate in the new movement, I trust that a general invitation will be extended te them to do so.- As regards the passage in my note of the 19th May relating to certain regions of which the welfare and integrity constitute a special and vital interest for the peace and safety of this country, I need only repeat that His Majesty&apos;s Government, in Great Britain accept the new treaty upon the understanding that it does not prejudice their freedom of action in this respect.I am entirely in accord with the views expressed by Mr. Kellogg in his speech of the &quot;28th April that the proposed treaty does not restrict or impair in any way the right of self-defence, as also with his opinion that each State alone is competent to decide when circumstances necessitate recourse to war for that purpose.In the light of the foregoing explanations, His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain are willing to join with the United States and with all other Governments similarly disposed in signing, in the form transmitted in your note of the 23rd June, a definitive treaty for the renunciation of war.
