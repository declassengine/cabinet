ItHIS DOCUMENT&apos; IS THE PROPSRTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT).E C RET. CP. 236(28)*COPY NOCABINET.STABILISATION OF WAR PENSIONS.REPORT OF DEPARTMENTAL CONFERENCE .(Circulated &quot;by. direction of the Chancellor 2 IL the Exchequer).1.     The Conference which the Treasury was instructed to convene by Cabinet Minute 36 (28) 4 (a) of the 4th July has considered the possible effect of the. stablisa-tioh of War Pensions upon post-war Pensions of the Fighting Services.2.     Post-war Pensions fall into three main categories Service;, Disability and Widows.(a) Service Pensions for Officers have been, and will continue to be, revised periodically in accordance with the Cost-of-Living, and future revisions will not be affected by the stabilisation of War Pensions. s(b) Service Pensions for Men are not subject tc automatic revision, and the scales approved in 1919 are still in operation.     The question of the introduction of lower scales for new enlistments (for whom lower scales of pay have already been adopted) Is under consideration by a Cabinet Committee under the Chairmanship&apos; of Sir John Gilmour, and an early decision is anticipated.     The stablisation of War Pensions vrpuld not in&apos;the opinion of the conference prejudice the&apos; promulgation
of a lower scale of Service Pensions for new enlistments, the two Issues being separate and distinct. Nevertheless the conference considered that it would be desirable, with a view to avoiding possible political difficulties, that the two announcements should not synchronise. &apos;(c) Disability Pensions for both Officers and Men, except in so far. as they may include service and rank elements to which (a) and (b) above apply, are not subject to automatic revision, but the Service Depart-.ments have power to review the existing rates from time to time. No revision of the post-war disability rates has in fact been carried out, and none is In contemplation(d) Widows&apos; Pensions have similarly not been revised, nor is any revision contemplated,3.     The stabilisation of War Pensions will undoubtedly render difficult for some years at least any revision of post-war Disability or Widows&apos; Pensionso     She amount of raohey at stake is, however, comparatively negligible, and: the Conference was unanimously of opinion that the stabilisatio of War Pensions should not in any event entail any additional expenditure on the part of the Service Departments a(Signed) GpC.
