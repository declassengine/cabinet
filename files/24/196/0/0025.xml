REPORT.I.  Intboduction.Terms of Reference.1.   We were appointed : &apos;&apos; To examine the situation which has arisen as a result of the competition of the Beam Wireless with the Cable Services, to report thereon and to make recommendations with a view to a common policy being adopted by the various Governments concerned.&quot;We accordingly submit the following Report.Meetings.2. We held our first meeting on Monday, the 16th January, 1928, and decided, in the first instance, to address communications to the Cable and Wireless interests concerned, enquiring whether they wished to give evidence before the Conference.As a result of these enquiries, representatives of the following companies attended meetings of the Conference and explained the nature and status of their undertakings, their relationship with the Governments concerned, and their views in regard to the problems before the Conference : The Eastern and Associated Telegraph Companies.The Indo-European Telegraph Company.Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph Company.The Canadian Marconi Company.The Wireless Telegraph Company of South Africa.The Indian Badio Telegraph Company.Memoranda or written representations were submitted on behalf of each of the above Companies, and information was also furnished on behalf of the Pacific Cable Board.The Board of Directors of the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia), Ltd., considered that for proper representation to be made on their behalf it would be necessary for someone thoroughly acquainted with the subject and having direct knowledge of the Board&apos;s views to travel from Australia to England, which could not be done under four months. The Conference was unable to suspend its deliberations for this purpose.3. The Conference held 34 meetings. A list of persons who have attended these meetings as witnesses, is attached as an Appendix.4. The Conference also received a deputation from the Empire Press Union, the Executive of which had previously submitted a statement of their views, and communications were received from the Federation of British Industries and the London Chamber of Commerce, submitting views and resolutions relating to the prob-lems before the Conference.
II. The, Problem.Telegraph Systems of the Empire.5. At the time when the Conference assembled, the situation in regard to cable and wireless communications .between the various parts of the Empire had been fundamentally affected by the opening of the Imperial &quot;Beam&quot; wireless services.6. Before the advent of the &quot;Beam,&quot; telegraphic communica-tion depended, upon the following services :-.(a.) Great Britain and Canada.(i.) The two &quot;Imperial&quot; transatlantic cables* owned by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain.(ii.) A long-wave wireless service, conducted in Great Britain by Marconi &apos;s Wireless Telegraph Company, and in Canada by the Canadian Marconi Company;(iii.) Cables of two American Companies, viz., the Commercial Cable Company and the Western Union Telegraph Company;(iv.) Cables of the Anglo-American Telegraph Company (British) leased for 99 years, from the 1st April, 1911, to the Western Union Telegraph Company.(b.) Great Britain, Australia and Neiv Zealand.(i.) The cables to Canada referred to in. (a) above, thence, across Canada, land lines rented from the Canadian Pacific Railway Com-pany, and thence the cables of the Pacific Cable Board between Bamfield (British Columbia) and Southport (Queensland), Sydney (New South Wales), and Auckland (New Zealand). (The Imperial Trans-Atlantic Cables, the land lines across Canada and the Pacific Cables, thus provide an &quot; All Bed &quot; route, no part of which lies in foreign territory);(ii.) The system of the Eastern Telegraph Company and its Associated Companies.(c.) Great Britain and South Africa.The cables of the Eastern and Associated group of Companies.(d.) Great Britain and India.(i.) The cables of the Eastern Telegraph Company; and (ii.) The overland route maintained by the Indo-European Tele-graph Company and the Indo-European Telegraph Department of the Government of India.* Of these, No. 1 consists mainly&apos; of an ex-German cable by way of the Azores which formerly connected Germany and the TJ.S.A., but was cut at sea on the outbreak of war in 1914 and subsequently linked at the eastern end with Penzance and at the western end with Halifax, Nova Scotia. No. 2 also con-nects Penzence. and Halifax, by way of Harbour Grace, Newfoundland, and was purchased as an auxiliary cable in 1920.
The Imperial Beam Wireless Services.7. On the 25th October, 1926, the Anglo-Canadian Beam service was opened, the operation being undertaken in Great Britain by the Post Office and in Canada by the Canadian Marconi Company. The rates remained the same by cable and by wireless. The long-wave service previously operated in Great Britain by the Marconi Com-pany was terminated on the same date.8. Three further services were opened on the following dates in 1927 :-Great Britain-Australia : 8th April, Great Britain-South Africa : 5th July. Great Britain-India : 6th September.9. The following table shows, the reductions which have been made in full-rate charges to and from Great Britain  	Australia.	South Africa.	India.	s.   d.	s.   d.	s.   d.Cable rates, January 1927	...   2 6	2 0	1 8Present cable rates	...   2 0	1 8	1 5Beam wireless rates   ...	...   1 8	1 4	1 110. The Beam full rate for these three services is thus cheaper by Id. to lOd. a word than the old rates, and the cable rates have been brought down by 3d. to 6d. a word.* There is a uniform difference of 4d. a word on each of the three services between the present cable and wireless charge for full-rate traffic, a uniform difference of 2d, for deferred traffic, and differences ranging from M. to \d. for letter telegrams and Press telegrams.The Operation of the Beam Services.11. In Great Britain the. Beam stations are owned and operated by the Government, the General Post Office being the responsible Department. The Agreement under which the stations were constructed for the Government by the Marconi Company, provides that the rates for traffic are to be fixed by the Postmaster-General in such a way as to &quot; attract the largest possible volume of traffic, with due regard to economic considerations.&quot;12. In Canada the Imperial Beam Service is operated by the Canadian Marconi Company, under a licence renewable on the first of April in each year. All tariff charges are subject to the approval of the Canadian Board of Railway Commissioners. All operators must be British subjects. The licence conveys no monopoly and may not be assigned. The existing rates are specified in an agree-ment between the Company and the General Post Office in London and may be altered by agreement in writing.13. In Australia the service is operated by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd.   All rates are subject to the approval* In the case of the Pacific Cables this reduction was effected on the 1st of February, 1927 (i.e., prior to the opening of the. Beam service), and was a resnlt of the completion of the new Cable at the end of 1926.
appreciable increase in the t ital volume of telegraph traffic. But in spite of this it has been represented to us that the cable under -takings affected by the wireless rate reductions and the Indo-European land-line service have been brought to a serious position by the two-fold reduction in their receipts resulting from the opera-tion of the lower rates introduced as a means of countering Beam competition* and also from the loss of a considerable volume of traffic to the Beam services. It should, however, be observed with regard to the Canadian service, where wireless and cable rates are the same, that no crisis has at present arisen.19. The Pacific Cable Board finished the financialyear 1927-28 with a small profit, in addition to payment of. full amortisation, owing to drastic economies and to the fact that they had budgeted for a surplus of  100,000-the realised surplus of 1926-27.20. On the other hand the present Beam rates on the Australian, South African and Indian services assuming the existing traffic to be maintained or the increase to be continued  yield a very high profit, and these rates could be substantially reduced and still give a handsome return on the capital invested in the Beam undertakings. It follows that the Beam services could always afford to undercut the cable rates, and if competition were unrestricted could render the cable systems unremunerative. Having regard to these considerations it was suggested to us that those responsible for the Cable Companies might be pressed, unless a satisfactory means of obviating the effect of acute competition could be provided, to liquidate their undertakings at once and distribute their large reserves among their shareholders, rather than to remain in operation and dissipate their resources.The Necessity for the Retention of the Cable Systems.21. There are many parts of the Empire (besides foreign countries served by the Eastern system) which are not at present, and may not for some time to come be, served by wireless. Further, the existing wireless services are subject to fading and occasional prolonged interruptions, which would be a serious hindrance to urgent commercial telegrams if the cables were not available. It is obvious also that the cables have a value for strategic purposes. To sum up, therefore, it may be said that wireless offers a cheap service, but not all-sufficing. It remains important for commercial and other purposes that the majority of the cables should be kept in operation.The Threat from Foreign Enterprise.22. In this . connection information has been laid before us which points to an attempt on the part of certain foreign interests to secure an increased share in the control and operation of world communications. There can be no doublt that British Cable and Wireless Companies will have to face increasingly keen competition* Except in the case of the Pacific Cables; see note to para. 10.
from foreign interests. It is obvious that, if the Eastern Telegraph and Associated Companies went into voluntary liquidation and wished to dispose of their assets, the opportunities presented to foreign interests to strengthen their position would be considerable.Summary of the Problem.23. The main features of the situation referred to us for examination and report may therefore be summarised as follows : (a.) The Cable undertakings operating between the constituent parts of the British Empire would be unable to continue on a paying basis in face of unrestricted competition on the part of Beam Wireless Services.(b.) The Eastern and Associated Telegraph Companies would be in a position to go into voluntary liquidation and dispose of their assets to the highest bidder.(c.) There are indications that foreign enterprise might be ready to seize an opportunity of acquiring such part of the Eastern and Associated Companies&apos; system as could be transferred&apos;to a foreign purchaser.(d.) Owing to the lack of complete secrecy and certainty, &quot; Wire-less &quot; is not yet in a position entirely to supersede cables. Cables, therefore, still possess great value for the main-tenance of necessary communications between the constituent parts of the Empire for commercial and strategical purposes.III. Possible Courses or Action by the Governmentsconcerned.24. Broadly speaking there are five ways in which the Govern -ments concerned might deal with this situation, viz. : (a.) Non-intervention. To refrain from any intervention and allow economic causes to decide the issue.(b.) Subsidy. To assist the cables by direct subsidy to remain in operation until such time as they may no longer be required owing to developments in wireless.(c.) Minimum Revenue - Guarantee. To check the inroads of competition mainly by controlling the cable and wireless rates respectively and to give an undertaking that should a large diversion of traffic from the cables reduce the revenue of the cable undertakings below a fixed level the Governments concerned would make up the amount necessary to provide a minimum standard revenue.(d.) Pooling Scheme. To diminish the force of wireless competi-tion on the Imperial -routes by sharing part of the joint revenue of the Beam and cable services.(e.) Fusion. To amalgamate so far as possible in one under-taking all the cable and wireless interests conducting communications between the various parts of the Empire so as to secure unity of control and unity of direction..We propose to examine each of these seriatim.
25. Non-Intervention. If no action were taken by the Govern-merits, there would be a danger of the following consequences ensuing: The Cable Companies might go into liquidation, and their physical assets might be put up for sale. The Governments of the parts of the Empire concerned would then be faced with the alter1 native of purchasing the essential portion of these assets or seeing them&apos;pass into other -probably foreign hands. We assume that neither of these alternatives would be acceptable to the Govern-ments concerned and that, therefore, this course may be summarily dismissed.26. Subsidy.-We assume that a subsidy to the cables would prove as unacceptable to the Governments as the prospect of purchasing the essential assets of the Cable Companies as indicated in paragraph 25 above, and that therefore it also can be dismissed.27. Minimum Revenue Guarantee. A solution of the problem was considered on this basis. The main, principles of the scheme were to ascertain the minimum revenue on which the Cable Com-panies might be induced to carry on for a term of years, giving them an opportunity to safeguard their profits by efficient administration. It was proposed that the Governments concerned should exercise con-trol of wireless rates and thereby hold the balance of cable and wireless earnings in such a manner as might save them, from financial obligation. An examination of the position led- us to conclude that in all probability the Governments concerned would be called upon to make contributions to the minimum revenue fund at a comparatively early date.28. Pooling. With regard, to pooling we have given con-sideration to the possibility of a scheme of joint purses by which the earnings of the cable and wireless services upon specified routes might be shared in such a way as to secure to the Cable Companies a reasonable but not luxurious return on their capital, and to the Public prospective reductions in rates as traffic and revenue expand. Such a scheme, it was suggested, would provide a modus vivendi which would tide over the next few years without cramping development, while at the same time leaving the Governments concerned free to revise their policy at the end of the agreed period in the light of scientific developments and economic changes. It would be difficult on the other hand to ascertain the precise financial prospects of these Pools, and the possibility of a contingent guarantee of their solvency on the part of the Governments concerned might arise. Moreover, it is impossible to realise as large economies from any pooling scheme as might be achieved by complete amalgamation. Further unity of control and unity of direction and administration cannot be achieved by - this means and thus the union, such as it is, is not free to turn all its resources and energies either to conducting a large public service or to facing external competition from foreign enterprises.29. Fusion. An amalgamation in one undertaking of all the cable and wireless interests conducting communications, between
IV. Developments while the Conference was in Session.Proposed Lease of Pacific Cable Board&apos;s System.32. In the course of pur preliminary examinations we came to the conclusion that it would be desirable, as part of any arrangement which might be made with the Eastern Telegraph Companies, at any rate to lease the Pacific Cable Board&apos;s system to those Companies. We accordingly enquired from the Governments concerned whether they would view with favour such an arrangement, based on satisfactory terms and Conditions. The tenour of the replies was to the effect that, while reserving any decision until such time asthe various parts of the Empire would avoid most of the objections which we have raised in the preceding paragraphs. By such an arrangement unity of control and unity of direction would be secured. The continuance of the cable system would be assured, economies could be effected, and the creation of a common purse and a common interest would leave the union free to devote its united energies to resist encroachments on the part of foreign competitors. It is along the lines of some such arrangement as this that we see the best chances of conserving and improving the communication services of the Empire without entailing contributions from public funds. Further, there should be a reasonable prospect of securing reductions in telegraphic rates. On the other hand, the amalgamation, being in the nature of a monopoly, necessarily, gives rise to apprehension concerning the safeguarding of. public interests. We feel, however, that, wide as the ramifications of such an amalgamated undertaking may be, means and measures can be devised which will guarantee to the communities concerned an efficient service at a reasonable cost.30. To sum up, therefore, it may be said that, of the five possible courses, the first two (non-intervention and subsidy) are clearly not such as we could recommend; the third and fourth (minimum revenue guarantee and pooling system) might offer temporary solutions without however dealing radically with the case; while the fifth (fusion) if acceptable to the Governments concerned seems to us to form the. basis of a permanent settfe-ment of the problem which has been referred to us.31. It will be appreciated that, while the adoption of any one of the third, fourth, or fifth courses, would be facilitated by a merger of the Eastern and Marconi Groups, the fifth involves considerations of policy in regard to the disposal of Government-owned assets such as the Pacific Cable Board&apos;s system, the Imperial Transatlantic cables, the General Post Office Beam stations in Great Britain, and the Government-owned cable and wireless system in the West Indies. We deal below with these aspects of the question.
Proposed Merger between the Eastern and Associated Telegraph Companies and Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph Company.S3. As indicated above (in paragraph 31) we formed the opinion that a merger between the Eastern Telegraph Companies and Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph Company, negotiations towards which had been instituted by the Companies themselves before the first meeting of the Conference, would facilitate the solution of the problem referred to us provided satisfactory arrangements were secured to safeguard the interests of the Governments and Public. We accordingly addressed a further communication to the Govern-ments represented on the Conference, setting out the considera-tions which had prompted us to form this opinion and enquiring whether any objection was entertained to a solution being sought on this basis. The replies of the Governments indicated that no objection was entertained to a solution of the problem being sought on the basis of a merger, except that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa made certain reservations in regard to their position and that of the Wireless Telegraph Company of South Africa.34. On the day that these replies were being considered by the Conference we received a letter signed jointly by the Chairmen of the two Companies, to the effect that a merger between them had been arranged subject to certain conditions. The terms of this letter are set out below : Dear Sir, London, E.C. 2, March 14, 1928.We beg to advise jou that the negotiations between the Eastern and Associated Cable Companies and the Marconi Wire-less Telegraph Company have resulted, on the recommendation of Sir William Plender and Sir Gilbert Garnsey, in an agreement having been reached between the Boards of the two groups pro-viding for a fusion of the interests of the Companies through the medium of a proposed Holding Company... The Agreement so arrived at is subject to satisfactory arrangements being made with the British Government and the Governments of the Dominions and India, and also to acceptance by the Stock and Shareholders of the Cable Companies and of the Marconi Company.:  Yours faithfully, J. Dbnison Pbndbe, Inverforth, Chairman,Chairman, MarconVs Wireless Telegraph Co,Eastern Associated Cable Companies,the terms of any proposed arrangement were available for examination, the Governments concerned did not wish to preclude us from conducting enquiries on these lines.
35. The proposed extent and allocation of capital in the new Company was communicated to us, and has been announced in the Press, in the following form: 5  per Cent. Cumulative Preference Shares of  1 each : ,        ,&apos;   .&apos;    &apos;      / . &apos;      &apos;, / &apos;20,000,000 to Eastern and Associated Telegraph Companies. 3,500,000 to Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph Co., Ltd.23,500,0001\ per Cent.

36. Having regard to the large sums involved and the intricacy of the accounts on which they are founded, we thought it advisable to enlist the assistance of experts, who are recognised authorities in matters of finance and accountancy, to examine the basis of the proposed fusion. We were fortunate in being able to secure the services of Sir 0. E. Niemeyer, G.B.E., K.C.B., and Sir William McLintock, K.B.E., C.V.O., for this purpose.Beam Wireless and Gable Assets of His Majesty&apos;s Government inGreat Britain.37. As indicated in paragraph 31, any scheme of complete fusion would entail also a transfer in regard to ownership or manage-ment of the Beam Wireless and Cable assets belonging to His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain. We were informed that the arrangements contemplated by the Eastern and Marconi Companies included a transfer to them of these, assets; and it is possible that unless the Beam installations were transferred to the new Company the merger would not, in fact, take place. Such a transfer would involve for His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain a departure from the policy hitherto adopted in regard to the conduct of wireless services. We felt, therefore, that no useful purpose would be served in pursuing the consideration of such an arrangement until we were advised as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain towards it. In this case also His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain, while reserving any decision until precise proposals were available, intimated that they did not wish to preclude us from conducting enquiries with a view to ascertaining whether a satisfactory solution could be found on this basis.Negotiations with the Companies Concerned.38. We accordingly instituted negotiations with the Companies concerned, and in doing so were careful to emphasise that they were undertaken on the understanding that their object was merely to enable us to formulate recommendations to the Governments con-cerned, with whom rested the final decision in regard to all the matters involved. It will be appreciated that the conduct of the nego-tiations was no easy task, and we should like to place on record our appreciation of the work carried out by Sir Otto Niemeyer and Sir William McLintock on our behalf.V: Beoommbndations.39. As the outcome of these negotiations we submit the scheme outlined below for consideration by the Governments concerned, as providing the best solution of the problem referred to us.40. The objects of this scheme are (a) to secure, as far as is possible, all the advantages to be derived from unification of direction and operation; (b) at the same time to preserve for the Governments
concerned control over any unified undertaking which may be created, so as to safeguard the interests of the public in general and of the cable and wireless users in particular; and (o) to secure these desiderata at the minimum of cost to the Governments concerned.41. Before setting out our recommendations in detail, we desire to record that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa has stated that it fully realises the necessity for maintaining adequate means of communication between the various parts of the Empire and with that object participated in this Oon-ference. It was because the Union of South Africa is in an entirely different position from that of Great Britain and the other Dominions, who possess in some instances financial control and in others financial interest either in cables or in wireless or in both that the Union Government made the reservations referred to in paragraph 33 above.42. We wish also to note that the existing joint-purse arrange-ments between the Eastern Companies and the Indo-European Telegraph Company and the Indo-European Telegraph Department of the Government of India will not be affected by the acceptance of the recommendations detailed below, although the precise terms of these arrangements may possibly require revision.43.   Our recommendations are accordingly as follows :  Recommendation (I). The Merger Company.The Merger Company to be formed ivill acquire as from the 1st April, 1928, all the Ordinary Shares of the Eastern, Eastern Extension and Western Telegraph Companies, and all the Ordinary and Preference Shares and Debentures (if any) of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company.We consider that, since this merger has been the subject of agreement between the parties concerned and its terms have been publicly announced, it forms the obvious basis for the creation of a company to combine the respective interests of the Cable and Marconi Groups. Bearing in mind that the Cable Group has large investment interests and the Marconi Group manufacturing and other interests, which are not in either case directly concerned with communication services, it has been proposed to and accepted by the parties to the intended merger that there should be formed an entirely separate company on public utility lines to own all the assets and conduct all the business of the Merger, in so far as they relate to Communication Services. We deal with this important aspect under recommendation (ii) below.Recommendation (ii). The Communications Company.There will also be formed a Communications Company to which the Cable and Marconi Companies will sell as at the 1st April, 1928, all their Communication Assets in exchange
for shares. The Communications Company will therefore hold all the Communication Assets of the Cable and Marconi Companies except in so far as these belong to the Subsidiary Companies in which the Cable and. Marconi Companies&apos; holding is less than 100 per cent. The Communications Company will acquire the holdings of the Cable and Marconi Companies in those Communications Companies in which the Cable and Marconi Companies&apos; holding is less than 100 per cent. The Communications Company will also acquire the Government Cables and hold the lease of the Post Office Beam Stations. The capital of the Communications Company not to exceed at its inception  30,000,000.By the formation of the Communications Company on the lines indicated above, an arrangement is made to segregate in one Company the Communications Company what may be termed the purely &apos;&apos; communications&apos;&apos; aspect of the undertaking, leaving in the hands of the Merger Company the investments of the Cable Companies and the Marconi interests in non-traffic under-takings and other activities, such as the manufacture of radio apparatus, and the exercise of wireless patent rights, in which the parties to the Merger Company are interested. Further, the proposed capitalisation of the Communications Company will bear a direct relation.to the purely &quot;communications&quot; assets and operations of the undertaking. This arrangement will enable a scheme to be drawn up for the equitable apportionment of future profits derived solely from, communication operations as between the shareholders of the Company and the cable- and wireless-using public.   We deal with this point in greater detail below.Recommendation (iii). Terms of Transfer of the GovernmentsCable and Beam Assets.The Communications Company to take over&quot; as from the 1st April, 1928,- the Pacific Cable Board&apos;s Cables, the West Indian Cable and Wireless System worked by the Pacific Cable Board, the Imperial Atlantic Cables and the lease of the Post Office Beam services (including provision for the transfer to the Company of existing staffs) on terms to be arranged.The Beam Services to be leased for 25 years at a rental of (a) a basic sum of  250,000 per annum;(b) as from the 1st April, 1931, an addition equivalent to12 per cent, on any increase in the Company&apos;s profits (from communications services) above the standard revenue;(c) a payment of  60,000 to be paid in such manner as maybe agreed.The Communications Company to undertake to meet the annual service of the outstanding debt on the Pacific Cable Board as on the 1st April, 1928, and to pay in addition a capital sum of  517,000 for the Pacific Cables together with[17880] a
interest at 5 per cent, as from the 1st April, 1928; to -pay  300,000 for the West Indian Cable and  450,000 for the Imperial Cables.The rental payable by the Communications Company and the service of the Pacific Cable Board debt will be guaranteed by the Merger Company.Recommendation   (iv). Direction and   Management of  the undertakings concerned.The Board of Directors of the Merger Company, the Commu-nications Company, the Cable and Marconi Companies will be identical. Two of the Directors, one of whom shall be Chairman of the Communications Company, to be persons approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the suggestion of the Gable Companies.If the Boards of the various Companies involved were not identical, there would be a risk of separate, and possibly conflicting, policies being pursued by the different entities in the undertaking. This would be bound to militate against efficiency; and unity of direction, which is one of the main objects of the scheme, would not in fact be secured.At the outset the number of Directors will, in consequence of the amalgamation, be large. It has however been proposed to and accepted by the Companies, that as and.when opportunities offer this number will be reduced to a smaller figure, say twelve, including of course the two Directors approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Recommendation   (v). Revenues   of   the   CommunicationsCompany.A standard net revenue of  1,865,000 (exclusive of non-telegraphic investment revenue) from the Communications Com-pany services to be fixed to the purposes of the Company : all net revenue from Communications Service in excess of that sum to go as to 50 per cent, to the Company, and as to 50 per cent, to reduction of rates or such other purpose as the Advisory Com-mittee (see recommendation vi) may approve. If additional capital expenditure is incurred by the Communications Company in relation to traffic, there shall be added to the above initial standard revenue an appropriate charge for interest at such rate as may later be agreed.It is obviously desirable that, as a corollary to handing over to private enterprise the conduct of public services, there should be an effective method for ensuring that the users of this service shall not be exploited for the benefit of the shareholders in the private undertaking. Some check ought, therefore, to be placed on the profits which may be earned by the Communications Company. With this object in view, a standard net revenue, representing approximately 6 per cent, on the capital of that portion of the under-taking which is solely engaged in the conduct of communications is, therefore, fixed as the normal amount which the Company may
appropriate without question to its own purposes. Any excess over this amount should obviously be devoted, in part at least, to the benefit of the users of the service. If the whole of this excess were attributed to the users, there would be little incentive to the Com-pany to improve and develop its services beyond the point where the standard net revenue was earned, and stagnation at this point might be expected to result. Such a state of affairs would not inure to the ndvantage of either the Company, the users of the service or the public generally. It is for this reason that a proportion of any excess revenue above the standard is allotted to the Company.Recommendation (vi). Control by the Governments concerned.The Communications Company to consult, in regard to ques-tions of policy, including any alteration of rates, an Advisory Committee, which we suggest should include representatives of the Governments participating in this Conference, to whom representatives of other parts of the Empire may be added as required from time to time with the approval of the Govern-ments concerned.No increase of rates prevailing at the date of the formation of the Communications Company to be made except -with the assent of the Advisory Committee.As the undertaking is one which closely concerns the several parts of the Empire, it is essential that they should have a voice in the direction of the policy of the undertaking; and having regard to the responsibilities of the Governments concerned, as trustees for the Public, it is essential that they should be in a position to exercise an additional measure of control over policy to that secured by approval of the nomination of certain members of the Board of the under-taking. ,  .The Imperial Advisory Committee should have access to all information in the hands of the Communications Company which is necessary to enable it to carry out its duties. Such information would, of course, be treated as strictly confidential.As has been indicated above, the main concern of the Govern-ments is to secure an efficient and cheap service. For this reason the Imperial Advisory Committee should, we suggest, be given absolute powers in regard to any proposed increase to existing rates, and the allocation of the funds which become available for rate reduction, &amp;c, in accordance with recommendation (v) above.But there are also other questions, such as the institution of new services, the discontinuance of any services which become commer-cially unprofitable, and the general distribution of traffic between alternative routes. For example, in regard to the question last mentioned, it will be desirable that a reasonable proportion of the total cable traffic between Great Britain and Australia and New Zealand should continue to pass over the route by way of Canada, which does not touch foreign territory at any point. It is not possible to prescribe in advance for all such contingencies. They can only be judged in the light of the circumstances obtaining at the time.   For this reason it should be provided that in all such
matters of general policy the Communications Company should consult&apos; the Imperial Advisory Committee. Cases may occur in which the interests of the public in regard to cheap commu-communication may Conflict with strategical requirements. In such cases the Committee must weigh the relative merits of the two considera-tions. and advise accordingly.We do not attempt to lay down the precise composition of the Committee or to define the status of its members, as we feel that these are matters outside our competence and more appropriate for deter -mination by the Governments concerned.Recommendation (vii). Additional Safeguards and Conditions.It is to be agreed : - (a) that British control of all the Companies must be guaranteed(b) that the Governments may assume control of the cable and wireless systems in time of war or other national emergency;(c) that the Fighting Services are entitled to build and workcable or wireless stations for their own purposes, but not for commercial purposes.In addition, there are, of course, a number of points of detail which will have to be included in the formal agreement with the Companies concerned, as, for example, an undertaking on the part of the Communications Company to submit their accounts, if required, to examination on behalf of the Advisory Committee; an undertaking on the part of both the Merger and Communications Companies not to dispose or allow any serious diminution in the control of their communications assets; safeguards against undue preference or excessive payments for apparatus manufactured or patented by the Merger Company; precise terms in regard to the transfer of personnel, &amp;c. Points such as these can only be dealt, with fully in a legal document, and need not, therefore, be elaborated further here.Recommendation (viii). Telephone Services.The Post Office in London will reserve the right to conduct the external telephonic services of Great Britain; but will agree with the Company the terms on which it will have the right to use the Company&apos;s wireless stations or portions thereof for telephonic purposes.44. The above scheme is designed to secure a common basis for the conduct of the Telegraphic Communications of the various parts of the Empire. The full benefits of the scheme can only be secured by the whole-hearted co-operation on the part of all the Governments concerned and of the undertakings conducting telegraphic communications throughout the Empire.&apos; The establishment or authorisation of services within the Empire, which work in opposition to, or indeed out of - harmony with, the above scheme would deprive it of much of its value and would  militate  against the objects  which we have
endeavoured to attain. We recommend, therefore, that, if our pro-posals commend themselves to the Governments of the several parts of the Empire, they should take steps to apply the principles of the scheme, with such modificaions in points of detail as may be neces-sary to meet local conditions, to the overseas telegraphic under-takings operating within their jurisdiction.For example, it will be appreciated that the prospects of harmonious working might be prejudiced if any of the undertakings concerned were not under predominant British control.45. After an exhaustive study of &quot;all the factors involved and. consultation with all the available interests concerned, we feel con-vinced that the scheme outlined above provides the best solution of what is a problem of the first importance to all parts of the Empire. The telegraph service is not only a matter of common interest, but possibly the link on which, more than any other, the several parts of the Empire depend for mutual intercourse and mutual understanding. Our recommendations will, we believe, establish this servce on a firm foundation, lead to its development and provide for its administration in a manner well calculated to bring to the communities which it is its function to serve all the benefits which naturally flow from a rapid, cheap and efficient system of communications.46.
