[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)Printed for the Cabinet.      July 1928. -SECRET.     &apos; J.   CP. 243 (28). . ^MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I think that my colleagues will be interested to read the speech, which i&amp; printed below, delivered in the Madras Legislative Council on 27th March by Dr. (Mrs.) S. M. Reddi, in support of-a motion to raise the legal age for marriage of boys and girls to 21 and 16 years respectively.Dr. Reddi was the first woman to secure membership of. any. of the, Legislative-bodies in India, and is the Deputy President of the Madras Legislative Council.. She has been appointed a member of the Committee set up by the Indian Statutory Commission to report on educational questions.Her speech on this occasion will be found to give authoritative support to many of the statements in Miss Mayo&apos;s book, &quot;Mother India,&quot; which were most hotly criticised, and to afford a valuable commentary on these criticisms.The motion in support of which Dr. Reddi spoke was&apos; carried in the Madras-Council, and my colleagues will be interested to learn that the Government of India have for some time been actively considered  -ing; this matter, in consultation with the Provincial Governments, in connection with Bills introduced by private members in the Central Legislature, and have just appointed a representative Committee of men and women to advise them on the best legislative course to adopt.BIREENHEAD.18th July 1928.Madras Legislative Council.Extract from Debates, 27th March 1928.Marriageable Age of Boys and Girls. Dr. (Mrs.) S. Muthulakshmi Reddi moved the following resolution : This Council recommends to the Government that they may be pleased to-communicate to the Government of India that in the opinion of this Council legislation raising the marriageable age of boys and girls to at least 21 and 16 years, respectively, &apos;is necessary.I beg to move this resolution on behalf of the woman population of tins country because, Sir, owing to the prevalence of the early marriage system among the higher class Hindus the advent of a girl baby is never welcome, the birth of a girl is looked upon as a great piece of misfortune especially if the parents are poor; the respou-sibility of finding a decent sxutable husband for her is already felt so keenly as to-kill even the paternal and the maternal love, with the sad result that in many poof-families girl children are neglected from the moment of their birth.In a few instances I have seen the girl babies allowed to die out of sheer neglect by their own parents. I know, Sir, after the ordeal of labour is over and the baby&apos;s first cry is heard, the parents, grandparents and every one of the. relations will be eager to know the sex of the child. Manj^ a time I. had to hide the unpleasant truth from them when the baby happened to be a girl, because even among the well-to-do the news will be received with feelings of sorrow and disappointment. I have very often desisted from breaking the sad news to the mother lest it should give her a shock or add to the shock especially if the labour had been a prolonged or instrumental one. Even theqpoor mother may be blamed for having given birth to a girl. The medical woman on attendance will not be remunerated properly. People in their sorrow will forget even the usual practice of distributing sugar and pans to their friends and relations. The whole house will put on a gloomy appearance. The grandparents with great reluctance will break the unwelcome news to their relations and friends ; if a boy baby, jiist the reverse state of things will prevail, when wires, not letters, will take the news to distant places ; if a girl, not even an ordinary letter message will be sent to relations. ^Thus owing to this evil custom of child marriage the girl child even from the moment&apos; of her birth becomes a concern and a burden on her family. As-.;she approached, her eighth or ninth year her parents begin to talk of her maniage, her2937      75   7.28
future husband and the probable expenses. So care and anxiety takes hold of the family.Naturally the girl shares in the feelings of her parents. We know of many instances when the sensitive girls burnt themselves to death with kerosene oil to save the parents the expense and annoyance of their marriage. Even such tragedies have failed to move the country into action. The sacrifice of such young innocent pure lives has failed to eradicate this pernicious practice, which reveals the, horrid fact what a stronghold this custom has upon our society. Very often she is stopped from attending the school.When the bridegroom is actually settled, there is nothing but the talk of marriage and the preparations for the marriage in that house.The girl loses all her childlike innocence, becomes shy, reticent, imitates all the ways and manners of the elderly women of the family. The women in the house, having no other outside recreation or distraction, indulge in such talks as to infuse into the minds of these girls the sex ideas of a mature brain. After the marriage, the girl becomes the property of the bridegroom&apos;s parents, and undue restrictions are placed on her movements. She should not run about or play or talk loudly or laugh in the presence of her mother-in-law or strangers. Tims she is robbed of the brightest period of her life, her girlhood and youth. She knows only childhood and womanhood. &quot; Thus from the period of infancy itself she is forced into the period of producing infants.&quot;Already she begins to think of her home, her husband, her future&apos;children, jewels and clothes, &amp;c. So she lives in a world of her own. Thus she is denied any useful knowledge or enjoyment of outside life, except occasional visits to her relations and friends where also the women will gossip only of the jewels, clothes, mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, husband, &amp;c. To a small extent tho conditions in the cities may be changing, but the lot of our girls in the rural parts is the same as ever.In such an atmosphere and with such a training it is no wonder the girl matures even before her bocjy is fully developed to perform the functions of, wifehood and motherhood.If puberty is delayed beyond 14, the husband&apos;s people get over-anxious and begin to consult the doctors. Many such cases have been brought to me for consultation. Sometimes the girl is made to live with her husband before even the first menses appears.   1 can bring to memory many such cases  I. The Triplicate case of a child-wife having been burnt to death because she would not satisfy the animal passion of the husband is still fresh in our memory.II. I can never forget the case of a girl-wife of 12 who looked in her development like a child of 10 having been forced to live with her husband, who was an M.A., and who was well over 40, a huge figure, even before the girl attained her puberty. She happened to be the second wife, and the girl had lost her mother, and they wrere of the Rowjee caste.. I pleaded for the girl with her husband, but in vain. Except in a few and educated and well-to-do families a few months after the girl attains puberty the husband&apos;s people demand the girl. If the girl is not sent another marriage for the boy is brought about. The boy may be 16, IS or 20, sometimes her husband is 50 or 60. Cohabitation will take place, the girl becomes pregnant when her age will be 13, 14, and rarely over 16.,,, Mostly such cases end in, abortions and miscarriages, the womb not being&apos; strong enough to retain the products of conception and to nourish them to their full growth and to full term.This very often happens on the day of&apos;; Seemantham ceremony,&quot;,owing to over-exertion and excitement. On that day the girl is decked with jewels and made to sit for a long time while visitors come and go and music is played. Rarely do pregnancies reach full term in these young immature girls and abortions and mis-carriages are daily complaints among them. The girls become anaemic and weak, and drag on a misei-able existence, very often develop tuberculosis.in the course of one year they have three or four abortions. The cases that reach full term mostly end in either prolonged, tedious or instrumental labour, with consequent disabilities to mother and child.During the 16 years of medical practice among the higher class Hindus, I have attended on many a child-mother ranging- from 12 to 15 not without many fears and misgivings as to the ultimate results of those unnatural labours.
I have sat by their bedside nights and days with a heavy heart vainly moaning -over their miserable condition, a condition brought about, not of her own free Avill or choice, not by her own imprudence or misdeed, but by a blind meaningless custom of -our society and the ignorant superstition of the parents.Thus I have watched the sufferings and pangs of labour in these young girls with ill-developed bodies bitterly cursing the very sky and soil which have given birth to .a race that blindly allow their dear and most beloved children to be sacrificed to a mad custom, because in most of these cases the labour is unduly prolonged, goes on for clays together and is acutely painful, owing to the ill-developed muscles and immature condition of the reproductive organs.Very often the delivery has .to be ended with instruments, which further adds to the shock, to the pain and the dangers of that most critical period dangers imiltiplied thousandfold owing to the practice of crude, unskilled, unscientific midwifery in the land.So even the birth of one child shatters her health and makes her so many years older.Again, I cannot describe to you, Sir. without a feeling of pang in my heart the miserable lot of our young Indian mothers, who themselves not keeping well owing to repeated conceptions, abortions and miscarriages, have to look after half-a-dozen -constantly ailing, fretful, sick children in the house.In the middle-class and poor families with an unsympathetic husband and an illiterate cruel-hearted mother-in-law, the lot of the poor young, inexperienced datighter-in-law is very hard indeed. She has to serve as a cook, as a nurse to her children, as the wife and a general servant in-the house, and, in addition, has to observe all the foolish acharams prescribed by the elders in the house.Such is the sad experience of eminent medical women in this country.This is a letter from Dr. Kugler, a lady who has spent- -15 years of her precious life on this subject.   She writes :-&quot; It was in 1883 that I first arrived in India and my work as a physician among the women and children has afforded me very many opportunities of seeing the evils resulting from child marriage. I have often -operated upon child mothers who have been seriously injured in childbirth, and I have seen many young mothers so injured that they could not again function as wives.;s * * * *, *&quot; Were I to enter into the details of my long and varied experience I could give many instances that I have seen of the deleterious effect of child marriage and enforced widowhood.   I could also write much-of the terrible infant mortality that makes India occupy so low a position in the health records- of the world.  ... My own conviction is that if India is to develop she must ha.ve the courage of her conviction-and be prepared to suffer for the carrying of them into effect.&quot;There is another lady doctor of Vellore, Dr. Ida Scudder, who writes to me as follows : &quot; During the 27 years that I have been in Vellore, I have seen many disastrous results of childmarriage and I will welcome the day when the age limit is raised to 15 or 16.&quot; I would probably have never studied medicine and would not have come back to India had it notbeen for three child wives, none of them over 14, who died during&apos; one night in the station I was at thetime. I was powerless to help. That was 30 years ago, but only a few months ago a girl of 13 or 14 icame to me to be repaired for vesico vaginal fistula (a laceration of the private parts).   She was like aninnocent child and found it hard to understand what had happened to her.   He was certainly between50 or 60 and &quot;proved to be her husband, and we still are brought face to face with the tragedy of the -child wife, and I rejoice that yon are taking such a strong stand against it, and believe you willwin.   I think the next thing that the medical woman in India should eradicate is the ignorant barberwoman dhai.&quot;Dr. Macphail, for whom, we all entertain a high regard, a lady who has spent -50 years in the service of Indian womanhood, tells the.same tale.   She writes :  &quot; During 40 years of medical work I have attended a good many labour- cases, and it is my iirm belief that the women of India have to endure an immense amount of unnecessary suffering at the time of delivery, and that the high mortality is -very largely due to their habits and the rules imposed on them by their social and religious customs and the overwhelming weight of public opinion. Considering the remarkable strength of family affection here and the devotion of parents to their children, it is a very remarkable fact, difficult to understand, that high caste parents insist on marrying their daughters while still children, thus submitting them to the risk of perpetual widowhood before they have realised what marriage means, or to have the man-iage consummated while they are still undeveloped and not fully grown.&quot;I have attended six. young girls who were about 12 years old, certainly not yet 13, and I have -attended many who were in their 14th or 15th year. Almost invariably these labours were abnormally long and. difficult, and the inevitable suffering was greatly increased by terror. In (me case the young mother went insane during labour from terror and pain, and it was many months before she recovered from the nervous shock and strain and was able to take her place in the family. When they do strrvive this ordeal, the salvation of these young mothers lies in the fact that the babies are usually very small. .But it is a very sad outlook for- the country if the children of the highest caste are so feeble, puny and
-undeveloped as many of these children prove to be. Many of these young mothers, we all know, are* permanently injured and never really recover.&quot;It is cruelty to young girls, from every point of view, to have even the betrothal marriage at so early an age, but it is infinitely worse to allow the consummation to take place while she is still a child especially if the husband is not a boy a,few years older than his bride, bat an elderly man who possibly has grandchildren older than his wife. Things are bad enough in Madras, but we all know that they are infinitely worse in the mufassal, where, when a suitable bridegroom cannot be found for a young girl,, her parents give her to any elderly man who is willing to take her since religion demands that she must be married before attaining puberty.&quot; Not only are the young&apos; girls of the higher castes subjected to the suffering that early wifehood and motherhood means, but they never have a chance of enjoying the happy care free girlhood which is. considered to be the birthright of girls in the same station in other lands. They have to take on the risks and cares of bringing up children and of rearing them when their education and physical development should be their only care.&quot;True it is that every female, whether plant or animal, has to go through that, physiological period at one time or the other in its life cycle, but there is a stage in. every life, there is a peiiod of development which every living being awaits patiently before it is called upon to fulfil that supreme function of life.Mature bones, mature muscles, nerves and fully developed reproductive organs, ought to fulfil their legitimate primary and sacred function of every created life.So much for the poor child mothers.The infants of those child mothers are puny and small, and the mother not having sufficient breast milk, the children have to be fed artificially, which in the hands of ignorant and young inexperienced mothers is never done successfully, the result being high infant mortality and morbidity.In spite of these sad experiences very often conception will take place before another full year is over.   The same tale of suffering and hardships for the poor-child mother will be repeated.These child mothers never enjoy life, they feel helpless, they submit to their lot as part of their nanrral existence and their evil &quot;Karma,&quot; while the parents of these-girls feel equally miserable and helpless.   The majority of these husbands, being yoiing and irresponsible, cannot exercise self-control so as to give their partners rest from these child-bearing&apos;functions.As for the boy husband, his lot is very often more to be pitied ; even while he is a student lie is burdened with the heavy responsibility of a family, and he has to attend on. his sick wife and children and he has r.o spend sleepless nights, has to rush home -&quot;after the school period is over, constantly call in the doctor ; very often when his wife is subject to constant abortions, his time will be spent between the doctor&apos;s and the chemist&apos;s.Before he finishes his education, he has to be contriving ways and means of earning a livelihood for himself and his family. How could we expect him to reap the full benefit of education, how could we expect him to seek knowledge for knowledge sake &apos;?Where is the time and scope for research and for making original discoveries? How could we expect him to become independent, self-reliant and assertive ?Before he reaches his manhood, before his intellect reaches its full growth and before he conies to know the world at its worth, the care and&quot; anxiety of home life overtake him.   Thus the joy of his innocent boyhood is marred land distorted.Even before he attains his full physical and mental growth, he is the father of half-a-dozen children, perhaps already on the anxious quest for a bridegroom for his daughter.Another sad aspect of this early marriage is that these little girls, at a period of their life when they can well afford to be happy, cheerful and enjoy life at its best, free from all the anxieties and worries of a. family life, are snatched away most mercilessly from their schools and playgrounds and the heavy burden and responsi-bility of home life is most cruelly imposed upon them when their mind and body is least prepared for such an ordeal.Thus, not only these girls are denied the unsullied joy of the most innocent period of their life, that period between their childhood and their womanhood, but also denied the education and enlightenment, that is a part of that life that would best enable, her to be an efficient housewife, a wise mother, and a useful citizen. It is-most deplorable,, most regrettable, that to a blind and meaningless custom, devoid of any reason or judgment, the health., the happiness, the comfort and peace, not only of&quot; those child wives and mothers, but also of our progeny, is sacrificed, and thus we allow ourselves to be styled a nation of pigmies.

We know also during the Vedic period and the Puranic period of our history no early marriage was practised. &quot; Swayamvara &quot; or marriage by choice was in vogue.Damayanthi, Sita, Savitri and a host of our great women who ornament our history &quot;were allowed full freedom in the matter of choosing their husbands. It was in Smrithi period that this pernicious custom had invaded the Hindu society and the lives of such single women as Viswavara, Shashvathi, Gargi, Meitrayi, Apala, Gosha, Aditi, Rornasha, Banumathi and Lilavathi illustrate the fact that marriage was not the only avocation for a woman, was not the end and aim of a woman&apos;s life. They could remain single and devote their lives to study, to research and to useful service.Baroda and Bharatpur have taken a step in advance. The Baroda Legislative Council has fixed the marriageable age for boys and girls at 18 and 14 respectively. The Maharaja of Kashmir has sanctioned a new law prohibiting marriage of girls before 14 and boys before 18. The Indian States of Gondal, Kotah, Mysore and Indore have enacted similar laws. The State of Rajkot leads all India as it has made the legal age at 15 and 19 for girls and boys respectively.This measure commands wide sympathy and support from all quarters, from the high and low. The enlightened manhood and womanhood of the country have been long demanding for this most urgent reform.2937bHow could you expect a girl child of 10 or 12 or even 13 to know the full significance of a married life, to understand its responsibilities and to perform the sacred function of a mother-the function of training her children to become patriotic, good and useful citizens? How could you expect a girl of 12 or 13 or even 14 to maintain order and discipline in the home, to keep the home beautiful, clean and hygienic, and how could you expect her to serve as your better half, to be your help-mate, and a friend in distress?Here is the definition of a wife given in Muhabaratha :-&quot;A wife is half the man, his truest friend ;A loving wife is a perpetual spring of virtue, pleasure, wealth ; a faithful wifeIs his best aid in seeking heavenly bliss ;A sweetly speaking wife is a companionIn solitude, a father in advice,A mother in all seasons of distress,A rest in passing through life&apos;s wilderness.&quot;So, could you imagine for one moment that our ancients expected the above qualities in a girl wife of tender age, say 12, 13 or even 14?In addition to disease, suffering and death, by a system of child marriage you deny to yourself and your children the happiness and comforts of a well-organised perfect home life, by a system of premature and ill-fitted alliances you deny to 37ourself all the joys o  a happy wedlock, and above all you do irreparable damage to the future race. ;.The saddest consequence of all is the presence of a large number of child widows in our midst whose lot and status in a Hindu family is most deplorable.We are too painfully conscious that the child widows, for no fault of their own; are subjected to such indignities, ill-treatment in a Hindu household, that her life is. rendered very miserable indeed. Here are the figures I have produced to convince the House of the iniquity of the evil custom even in our Presidency : Number of married to the total women is 95 lakhs to 217 lakhs. Number widowed is 40&apos;9 lakhs, and thus it forms nearly half of the total number of married women.
For the last few months this question has been agitating this country, and several meetings have been held in its support, as we all know. Of course, there is a certain amount of ignorant orthodox opposition, as for that in every country * however advanced it may be, there will be always opposition. 1 have got one of the memorials sent to me from a very orthodox quarter from Mayavaram. They say, &quot;We, the Brahmans, do not want to lose anything of the ancient traditions. . . The Brahmans were quite content with the physical strength needed for performing our Vedic and religious duties, and saying\.our saridhyavandhanam, &amp;c.&quot; Is that an argument, Sir, against the abolition of early marriages ?There will always be a few backward set of people who are against any change in their practices and who are worshippers of mad custom. The Government and the thoughtful amongst us can well afford to ignore them because these are the very people, Sir. who want to maintain caste, untouchability, who want to keep down women, and who do not want to move with the times.Surely they are not the right sort of people to be consulted on such vital matters like these, which concern the health and happiness of millions of our men and women and the good name of our.country ? ,&apos; In no part of the civilised world does this custom obtain ; in no part of the civilised world is the female life considered so cheap. Nations that do not indulge in such customs are happier, healthier and more prosperous-are physically stronger than we are.&apos; While we stick to such meaningless practices in the name of religion we suffer under so many disabilities.       ::We are poverty-stricken, we. are disease-stricken, and we are not a, free nation either.So, if we want to grow into a strong, robust and a self-respecting nation, if we want to reach our full physical and mental height, the system of child marriage must go, because science and experienced observation tell us that a girl becomes a woman only after the age of 16, and a boy his manhood only after 21 years.The remedy lies in your hands.Sir, on behalf of the innocent,, helpless, suffering girl children of this land, on behalf of millions of child wives, child mothers, and child widows, I appeal to all sections of the House, Hindus, Muhammadans, Christians, that you may whole-heartedly and unanimously support this resolution so that millions of our girls may be saved from a life of premature wifehood, premature motherhood; and, enforced widowhood, and a robust, virile, and happy race may take the place of the present generation of weaklings. . .
