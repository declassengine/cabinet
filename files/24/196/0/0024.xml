DOCUMENT IS THE -tPRO.EE!CTYri OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY7 S, GOVERNMENT) .224(23). -. CABIN E T.^M-SlJLC--?r.QR.1CS. LQANS BILL,  1928. Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.J1.     The Public Works Loans Bill Is in normal circumstances taken annually In July or August.     Its main purpose Is to fix the maximum sum which may be Issued to the Public Works Loans -Commissioners for tho purpose of making loans from the Local Loans Fund up to the date of the passing of a further Bill.      In 1927, owing mainly to the exceptionally heavy demands on the Fund in connection with housing,, two Acts were passed;    oi\e in March authorising the issue of  40 millions and one In December authorising the Issue of  25 millions.2.      It is estimated that the provision made under the latter Act would enable the Public Works Loans Commissioners to meet demands for loans up to the end of this year as there has been a considerable falling off in loans following the reduction of the Housing Suhsidy in October last.     If necessary,  therefore, a now Bill could be postponed until the Autumn, but it is desirable to revert to the normal time of taking the Bill if circumstances permit. 3.     The amount proposed in the Bill to be issued for loans is  50 millions which is estimated to be sufficient to meet requirements for the twelve months up to August 1929. . &quot; -1-
4.     Under Section 15 of the National Debt and Local Loans Act 1887 the principal of any loan not likely to be recovered is directed by Parliament to be written off. from the assets of the Local Loans Fund and to be made good ultimately by a Vote of Parliaments     In accordance with this procedure Clause 2 of this Bill authorises the write off of the unrecovered balances amounting to  1,215.9.3 of three loans made under the Agricultural Credits Act 1923. 5.     In some cases It Is necessary not only to write off bad debts from the assets of the Fund but further to remit the debt (remaining due to the Exchequer) as against the borrower.     This course is necessary in the case of the three loans now to be written off, as the borrowers have paid a final dividend either on bankruptcy or under a deed of assignment, and there Is no possibility of making any further recovery.     Clause 3 of the Bill therefore remits the principal outstanding together with interest accrued thereon.6.     The Bill does not usually give rise to controversy in the House and I ask for the authority of the Committoe to introduce it during the present Session If the arrange-ments for the business of the House indicate that It will be possible to pass it before prorogation.     This is an essential Bill and, if postponed, time would be needed for its passage in November or December.(Intld.)    A.M.S.Treasury Chambers, July 1928.
