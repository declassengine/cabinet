99 q,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OE HIS  TjfllTAKTlO -vaj-jb TY1 S GOVERNMENT. &quot; &quot;CABINET.SECRET. RAILWAY (ROAD TRANSPORT). BILLS.- - -,/ * Memorandum &quot;by , the minister er of Transport.These Bills, with the exception of that promoted &apos;by the Metropolitan Railway Company, of which Bill the&quot; -preamble was not found to be proved, have now been reported with considerable amendments by the Joint Committee, after a long hearing, and are to be considered by the House of Commons,on Thursday,evening next, the 12th July.    There are several points in connexion with the Bills to which I desire to draw the attention of my colleagues:-(l)    The Committee have inserted in the Bills provisions giving protection to the statutory tramway, trolley vehicle and omnibus undertakings of local authorities against competition by Railway Companies1&apos;1 road vehicles within the boundaries of such local authorities.   No such protection is given to local authorities in respect of their undertakings situated outside their boundaries, and no protection at all is.given to the statutory undertakings of companies. This situation will be represented on the one hand as inadequately protecting local authorities interested in transport undertakings and on the other hand as constituting a glaring and unfair discrimination against private enterprise as such.    The decision of the Committe on this point was, however^ evidently a-rrived at after careful consideration of the voluminous evidence and arguments brought before them by the various competing road transport interests.       It oould not be disturbed without opening&quot; the door to olaims by the municipalities
for more extended protection and to claims f or *  -protection by light railway companies and other road transport Interests, and if these claims were conceded the result might be that the railway companies&apos; powers to run passenger services would be so hampered as to be of little value to them in parts of the country where they are most exposed to competition. In the circumstances, I propose to advise the House that the carefully considered decision of the Joint Committee -on this point should be adhered to.(2)   The Committee decided that in view of the . special position in London.no powers should be given to the railway companies by these Bills to run road services for passengers within the area of the London County Council.    This area is not a traffic area under the London Traffic Act.    There is a strong feeling amongst London Members of Parliament that the railway companies should be prohibited from running passenger services which both pick up and set down a passenger on any one journey within the wider area of the Metropolitan Police District and the City of London,    This is the area within which the provisions of the London Traffic Act, as to the restriction of omnibus services, apply.    while I am not satisfied that having regard to my powers under the London Traffic Act, which are safeguarded by the Bills, any serious difficulty would arise from the decision of the Committee on this point, I do not propose to&apos;resist an amendment that would have the effect of substituting the Metropolitan Police District and the City of London for the area of the. London County Council if at the same time the Railway Companies are relieved of the restriction which the Committees decision imposes on running long distance services.    No traffic objection need be raised to such services by railway companies.
(5)   In my Report on the Bills to the Committee I commented on a clause which embodied the principle that the Railway Rates Tribunal, when railway charges were being reviewed, should have power, If they think that the net revenue derived from the road services la in. all the circumstances unduly low, to protect the users of the railway against being called upon, as a result of the operation by tho Company of an,ancillary business, to pay higher charges than would othervd.se be necessary,    I added that in my view considerable importance is, to be attached, to this principle and that the Committee would no doubt wish to satisfy themselves that the provisions of the Clause enabled full effect to be given to It in relation to an ancillary business of the special nature to be established under the Bill.     The Committee have not amended the Clause, but have inserted a. new clause enabling the Minister of Transport, If at any time he is of opinion that the Interests of the public are&apos;preJudicially affected by the exercise of the powers of the Bills, to direct a public inquiry, and to report to Parliament if the Company concerned fall to make proper provision for the protection of the interests of the public.The Federation of British.Industries are not satisfied with the ancillary business Clause as it stands.      In my view, however, apart from the difficulty of suggesting any specific amendment of Clause 12,that would not be open to objection, I welcomed the new Clause; 13, which the Committee have now inserted, and think that it should,be sufficient to stop up any gaps in the safeguards afforded by the other provisions of the Bills, and i propose to advise the House accordingly.
10th July, 1938.(4)   As regards other amendments that may he moved, I suggest that so far as they Involve amendments in principle of the carefully considered decision of the Joint Committee, they should he resist ed*    If am^dments are made in respect of one point, parties desiring amendments on other points will he encouraged to press their claims, and unless the Government can in both Houses take the line that the decision of the Joint Committee should be adhered to, further proceedings on the Bills may be prolonged and there may be difficulty in obtaining unanimity between the two Housese(5)   If the foregoing views are accepted, I should be glad if the whips could be asked to ensure that I am fully supported by our own side in any divisions on the point raised in paragraph (1).(intd, )   W.A.
