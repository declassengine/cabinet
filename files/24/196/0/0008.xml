CABINET.Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions on Rates of Great War Pension.I submit the following memorandum for the decision of the Cabinet.1,      The question whether the rates of Great War pension are (in accordance with the original intentions of the Royal Warrants)36 to be reduced after this year to correspond with the reduction that has taken place in the cost of living has recently shown signs of again coming to the fore.     On previous occasions when the same issue has been raised, an immediate decision has been necessary in order to avoid an impending reduction in the rates, which the Government have on each occasion postponed by a temporary arrangement, taking the view that &quot;under present conditions they were not in favour of a reduction of rates&quot;.     A reduction is not imminent at the moment, because under the temporary arrangement, which I was authorised to announce in 1925, the rates of pension are practically safeguarded until 1931.     It seemed to me, however, that it would be advantageous not only that the Government should take the initiative on this issue and come to a decision on the question well in advance of any pressure from either the British Legion or the Opposition, but still more that the whole issue should be removed from the sphere of politics by a permanent stabilisation of the rates of pensions if this were found reasonably practicable.     I, accordingly, considered the whole matter, in consultation with the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, by whom my views were provisionally accepted, and I was authorised by the Prime Minister to make the following statement in reply to a question on the 25rd instant j&quot;The effect of the arrangements made by the present Government in 1925 is to safeguard the existing rates of War Pension at any rate until 1931.     At the same time I may inform my Honourable and Gallant Friend that the Government are already considering the conditions under which stabilisation of the present rates of all pensions and allowances under the Great War Warrants could suitably be effected, and I hope to be in a position to make a full statement before the end of the Session&quot;.2.       The Cabinet will be aware that in approving stabilisation they will be fixing the rates of pensions many of which will continue to be payable more than a generation hence.     The considerations, however, that make any reduction of pension rates impracticable are not, I think, open to dispute.     Apart from the fact that the Government have more than once stated that in their view any reduction in the rates of pension must be &quot;conditional on a reasonable stability having been reached in the cost of living&quot; and that no such stability has been reached or is within sight, it must be clear that a proposal to reduce the present rates of pension would*   A Note on the Warrant provisions as to pension rates is appended to this Memo.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT) ,
would not be in the least likely to meet with support from any seotion of the House at the present, or indeed at any time. By 1931, the earliest date by which any reduction in the rates Is practically possible under existing arrangements, over 80$ of pensioners will have been allowed to draw their pensions at existing rates for 10 years or more, notwithstanding the fact that since 1920 the cost of living has been appreciably falling.     The disturbance which would be involved to close upon a million pensioners by a drastic reduction in the rates of pension would far outweigh the advantages of any economy that might be secured by it.     As it is, substantial reduction in expenditure has been secured in the administration of war pensions, the cost of which has fallen from  106,000,000 in 1920-21, to  57,000,000 in the present year, and by the scheme of final awards for disablement and the time limits Imposed on fresh claims, the State&apos;s liability has been so effectively limited that natural causes will bring about a continuous and steady reduction of the expenditure.     Any acceleration of the rate of decline by an arbitrary reduction of rates might, I think, seriously jeopardise the whole structure of pension administration.3.       The cost of maintaining the present Warrant rates above the minimum to which under the Warrants they might be reduced, if full advantage were taken of the fall in the cost of living, will in 1931 be rather less than  7 millions a year, out of a total expenditure amounting, as I estimate, to not more than about  50 millions.     This is, of course, not a figure to be underrated, and if the concession is made, as I propose, of a permanent stabilisation of present rates, it should be accompanied by certain conditions that will safeguard our future liability.     Those conditions should I suggest be that:-(a) in order to avoid any possibility of the present high rates coming to be regarded as a minimum, which it might be claimed should be increased in case the cost of living should rise, it should be a definite understanding that the rates now in operation remain based upon&quot; the cost of living for the standard year 1919.     While, therefore, those rates will not be reduced, however much the cost of living may fall, they will not be liable to increase unless the cost of living should ever come to exceed that of the year 1919, in which event the existing Warrant will operate.(b) it should be a further condition of the maintenance of existing rates that the present scope of the-Great War Warrants and War Pensions Acts is not extended by the addition of new classes of beneficiary to whom the present high rates would automatically become applicable.      In other words, the State*s future liability must-be safeguardedto the extent that, were any substantial addition to be made to the existing classes of beneficiary, the Government of the day must be free to review its rates of pension in the light of its aggregate liability.     This Is important as demands are being made In various quarters for the creation of new classes of pensioner, e.g., the widows of men who have married since their discharge from service.
4.       Along with the rates of pension, the rates of other allowances and grants which also were increased in 1919 to correspond with the increased cost of living, should be finally settled.     I think that here also the present rates should be stabilised, subject, however, to a qualification in respect of the special allowances which may be given under the Warrants on the occasion of medical or surgical treatment.5.       The allowances, in question, were meant as temporary grants for limited periods during which the man had to take a course of remedial treatment prescribed, by the Ministry for his war disability, and were to compensate the pensioner for loss of wages consequent upon his taking the treatment.     They were deliberately fixed on a generous scale at the suggestion of the Select Committee on Pensions, because in 1919 just after the war and demobilisation, employment was abundant and wages high, and a substantial inducement had to be offered to men to take treatment.     The allowance for a married man (ex-private), with, say a wife and two children, during his treatment as an in-patient is  2.14.6gI, a week, or during; out-patient treatment  3.3.6d.. a week.     This (with the fall &apos; n prices and wages that has occurred since 1919) is now often higher than the man s wages v/hen at work, and is usually a good deal higher than even the pension he would get if he v/ere totally disabled, because allowances are payable - though pension is not - for any family that a man may have got since his discharge from service.     Moreover, pensioners insured (as nearly all are) under the National Health Insurance Acts are now in most cases entitled to draw in full (in addition to the Warrant allowances) sickness and disablement benefit under the National Health Insurance, and these benefits have been increased to  1 a week or more for sickness benefit and lo/s.  a week or more for disablement benefit.6.       High as the allowances are,  and notwithstanding that they overlap with other benefits, I should not propose to interfere with their existing rates provided they are restricted to the cases for whom they were intended, namely, cases that will benefit by a definite and limited course of remedial treatment.      But the character of the patients who are being admitted to Ministry hospitals is in process of change.     A certain number of cases already are of the type which does net require, and is not likely to derive lasting improvement from, a definite course of special treatment and needs little more than institutional care and attention, often of a prolonged or even permanent character.     This class will, I am satisfied, increase rather than diminish as pensioners grow older.     But the present provisions of the Warrant provide in terms for a &quot;course of treatment&quot; only and in consequence cases of this type are now either taken into Ministry hospitals and receive allowances for very prolonged periods (or permanently) or they are left in their own homes and in most cases given the same high allowances.7.       This position is not satisfactory, and I think that with stabilisation of the rates of the Warrant opportunity should be taken to state that the Government foresee that it may be necessary to make special provision for a class of case not hitherto specifically contemplated, namely cases which will require institutional care and attention
attention for their pensioned disabilities, though their condition would not be amenable to a course of remedial treatment likely to effect a lasting improvement.     The provisions of the Warrant did not contemplate and are not adapted to this class of oase and may need modification to meet it.      I should propose to make suitable provision for this class of case a part of the whole scheme by which the Government stabilise the existing rates of the Great War Warrants.8.       In cases of the class I refer to,  allowances on the high scale appropriate to a brief course of remedial treatment should not be given, and. I would aim at arrangements generally similar to those adopted by the Chelsea Commissioners for in-pensioners.     This proposal (which has already been discussed and provisionally agreed with the Treasury) will have the double advantage (a) of enabling the Ministry to provide for a class of case for which no suitable provision exists at present, without additional cost; and (b)  of preventing future increase of the cost of allowances and even of bringing about a reduction in their present cost in so far as they are being drawn by cases for whom they were not intended.&apos;    It would, of course, be a condition of any such modification of our present arrangements that cases at present drawing full allowances would not be affected during their current stay in an institution,9.       I ask the sanction of the Cabinet therefore to make an announcement at a suitable opportunity that the rates of pension and of other allowances and grants will be stabilised, so far as they are expressed to be dependent on the cost of living, on the lines which I have suggested in paragraphs 3 and 7.G.C.

Note on Pension Rates under Great War warrants -1917. First Ministry of Pensions Warrant 1917 - rates of pension increased maximum for Ex-private 27/6d: for widow 13/9d. (at 45, 15/-); and in both cases allowances for children, 1st child, 5/-, 2nd, 4/2d, 3rd, 3/4d, 4th, 2/6d.1918.     Children&apos;s allowances increased to 6/8d, 5/-. and 4/2d (from 1.5.18).1918.     Bonus of 20$ granted (from 1.11.18) to meet increased cost of living, bringing maximum rates for ex-private to 33/-; for widow to 16/6d (18/- at 45): and for children to 8/-, 6/-, 5/-.1919.     On report of Select Committee rates again raised on maintenance basis and to meet further Increase in cost of living.      (Warrant of 1919).     For Ex-private 40/- a week, plus 10/- allowance for a wife, with 7/6d. for first child, and 6/- for each other child:    for widow, 20/- if without children and under 40 years old, and 26/8d. if over 40, or with children, with 10/- allowance for 1st child, 7/6d for second, 6/- for all other children! for dependent parent up to 20/- a week according to need.These rates were by the Warrant deemed to be proper to the cost of living in 1919, when the index figure of the cost of living was IIS per cent above the pre-war cost, and, while they were to be maintained until March, 1923, they were then to fall or rise annually if the cost of living had fallen or risen in the previous year (by at least 5 per cent) by comparison with the cost in 1919, subject always to the maintenance of the rates in force immediately before the 1919 Warrant (see above) as a minimum.1923.     Government decided that the rates should be maintained for another three years, because (a) the cost of living had risen against the pensioner in 1920 and 1921 (the maximum reached was 160 per cent above pre-war cost) and he had therefore suffered some loss, and (b) prices had not reached sufficient stability to make a reduction of rates advisable.1925.     Government decided to alter Warrant arrangements inorder to give greater security to pensioner, and, while maintaining existing rates till 1929,  (a) to make no change in those rates unless and until the cost of living fell to 60 per cent above pre-war cost, and (b) then only on the basis of a 3 years average of the cost of living, instead of one year&apos;s figure as required by the Warrant.     The index figure of the cost of living was for 1927, 67.5 per cent above pre-war cost.
