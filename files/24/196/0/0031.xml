[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;,sGovernment, j- ,   Printed for the Cabinet.       July 1928.     ;SECRET.CP. 231(28). &apos; . . . &apos;Indian Statutory Commission.On 22nd June I circulated to my colleagues (CP. 200/28) a long telegram from the Viceroy in which he asked me to consider, in consultation with Sir John Simon, a plan which had been suggested to him for meeting, or circumventing, the objections which have been taken to the Statutory Commission and its procedure on the ground that the proposed Indian Committees to co-operate with it will be in a position of inferiority. The plan suggested seemed to me (apart from the fact that I was advised that it was technically inadmissible) to contravene the stipulations made when the Commission was set up, and I therefore saw no advantage in consulting my colleagues or the Chairman of the Commission. This I explained in a telegram dated 20th June, which 1 circulated at the same time.I now circulate further correspondence between the Viceroy and myself, which is in effect an appeal by the Viceroy to the Cabinet to consider favourably bis-proposal. This proposal is, in a sentence, to amend the Commission^ Warrant so as to authorise the Commission to co-opt &quot;seven persons who may have been recommended by the Indian Legislature&quot; to be associated with them throughout their inquiry, and to direct these seven persons to write and sign a report to the King thus giving a different status to the Committee which it had always been intended that the Indian Legislature should set up. I also include a letter from myself to Sir John Simon with which I tiltirnately sent him a copy of my correspondence with the Viceroj7, and Sir John Simon&apos;s reply. With this correspondence should be considered further documents which I circulated on 28th June (CP. 209/28), consisting of a message from the Committee set up by the-Punjab Legislative Council to co-operate with the Commission, and a telegram from myself conveying the Commissions response to this message.To avoid recapitulation of the arguments set out in a somewhat length j interchange of views, I have decided to place the matter before my colleagues in the form of the draft reply to the Viceroy, by which, with their concurrence, I propose to determine the matter. I have naturally every desire to further the Viceroy&apos;s wish to leave no reasonable course untried which might result in securing co-operation between the-Indian political world and the Commission. But I am not prepared with this object to favour any course which is likely to destroy, or even to jeopardise, the main principles which led .His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide upon a Parliamentary, as opposed tea mixed, Commission ; and I am satisfied that the course proposed by the Viceroy would have that result. ^BIRKENHEAD.13th Julv 1928.From Viceroy, 22nd June 1928.Private and personal. I&quot; will await your promised telegram about in camera evidence before replying to your telegram of 20th June, No. 1722. Meanwhile I am concerned to see that you have in some particulars incorrectly appreciated effect and intention of my proposals, and that you have not consulted Simon. For although the matter of the Royal Warrant is obviously one for the decision of yourself and the Cabinet, nevertheless Simon&apos;s own position and the prospects of his ultimate success or failure in the discharge of his difficult task are directly and closely involved.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 25th June 1928.1764. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram of 22nd June. Simon Commission^ decision regarding in camera evidence, which was reached after discussion between myself and full Commission and in which I entirely concur,, will, I hope, remove some immediate difficulties.As regards the other matter there were two main reasons for not consulting Simon: (1) It seemed useless to spend our time in academic discussion of a 2899      75   7.28
proposal which had been foiind to be technically impracticable. (2) His Majesty&apos;s Government were careful, while giving Commission great latitude as to procedure; to lay down that it must be &quot;within our scheme.&quot; I regard, and 1 am sure Cabinet would regard, this proposal as not within our scheme, and it would have served on purpose to consult Simon about it unless I was prepared to advise Cabinet to modify our scheme. Moreover, Simon had already when in India considered and rejected the proposal, of which Patel appears to have been author. . My immediately following telegram gives text of his remarks about it in memorandum which ho recently submitted to Cabinet.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 26th June 1928.1765. Private and personal. Following is text of remarks referred to in my preceding telegram :  -v&apos;&quot; Proposals of various kinds have been hinted at in the course of private conversations I have had, with Mr. Patel, for example, and Mr. Jayakar, during the last few weeks. Mr. Patel wanted to know why the King-Emperor has not given me authority to co-opt a number of Indians who would be those chosen by the Central Legislature. I naturally enquired whether these Indians were to take part in writing, the Report, and pointed out that, apart from all other objections, this could only come about under section 84 (a) if the Indian names were to be approved by both Houses of Parliament-a suggestion which I told Mr. Patel was quite impracticable, since neither the House of Commons nor the House of Lords nor the Government would ever contemplate it for a moment. The only method which has occurred to me as at all possible is that His Majesty should issue to the Viceroy a formal authority which would empower the latter in the name of the King-Emperor to constitute the Committee when appointed &apos; The Indian Central Joint Committee merely eyewash, of course, but in India eyewash has a surprising effect. 1 do not, however, recommend this course myself, amongst other reasons because it is likely to lead to the further objection that such a Committee is still not on a par with the Commission, for the former could not send for persons or papers-a power which I certainly think the Indian Committee ought not to possess.&quot;My conclusion, therefore, is that it, is best to wait upon events and to avoid all semblance of a new departure at present.&quot;. From Viceroy, 27th: June 1928.I have now had Opportunity to consider your telegram of the 20th instant, 1722, in conjunction with your telegrams 1744 and 1745 of 22nd June.I am very pleased that Simon, in consultation with you, has reached such decision in regard to in camera evidence, and it will undoubtedly be helpful as regards Provincial Committees. But although it will assist us to get Provincial Committees, tactical importance of which I fully appreciate, I do not anticipate, that it will by itself exercise material influence in rallying new and important political elements to Commission, or in effecting the change in the general political temper which, if we can get it on possible terms, is so evidently desirable. It is on this aspect that I feel strongly and am impelled to ask you to think once more about the wider proposal contained in my telegram of 13th June, 363 S.2. In view of technical objection of Home Office to my proposal, I should like to emphasise exact effect of the latter as I see it. Simon&apos;s letter of 6th February, while pointing out that the Commission would report to the authority by which it had been constituted, contemplated also that the Committee of the Legislature would be entitled to report its conclusions to the Legislature. He stated that it was obvious that these documents would be prepared and presented simultaneously. If the Committee preferred it, the Commission would make its report an annexe to its own document so that both might be presented to the King-Emperor and made public at the same jmdment. A.s regards report of the Committee, therefore, the effective change introduced by my proposal is confined to this, that it would be presented to the King-Emperor direct instead of being presented to him as an appendix to the Report of the Commission. It is not suggested by me that Committee should have pOwer of calling for material on its own initiative or examining witnesses other than those presenting themselves before the Commission, or examining them apart from the Commission.
Throughout joint enquiry the authority of the Chairman of the Commission will regulate all questions and procedure. If, therefore, the objection of the Home Office-is &quot;that proposal goes beyond original intention of Warrant, and in words of your -telegram creates in effect two co-equal Commissions submitting two independent reports, then I ca&apos;not feel that the objection is well founded, for the position of the Committee will clearly not be equal to that of the Commission, and the existing procedure already provides for two independent reports. The innovation of my proposal lies in the manner in which the Committee&apos;s report will reach, the King-Emperor, not in the fact that it will be drawn up independently of that of the Commission.As regards the objection which the Home Office may feel against introducing into&apos; the Warrant the principle of co-option, I have examined such precedents as are available to me here. In 19.12, in case of Islington Commission, and again in 1926,. in case of Linlithgow Commission, it was ruled that no change in the Warrant would be required to allow a Commission to associate other persons in its enquiry, and both Reports make mention of the fact that they had, in pursuance of this power, co-opted certain persons without, of course, power to sign their Report. This is exactly what I want to do now, but for political reasons I want it done through Royal Warrant instead of merely by the Commission. I do not therefore propose that the members of the Indian Committee should be placed, as Home Office seems to think, on an equal footing with the Commission, inasmuch as they would have no power to summon witnesses, &amp;c, independently, or to sign the Commission^ Report, or take part in the final deliberations leading up to it. I would point out that it does not appear to be inconsistent with the existing Warrant that the Committee of the. Legislature should examine the Commission^ witnesses and material as laid down in your telegram of 22nd June, No. 1745, or that it should, as already promised by Simon, submit an independent report. I would accordingly suggest that the Home Office might be asked to consider whether the grant to the Commission of the authority to co-opt by the amendment proposed which, read with the rest of the Warrant, in no way enhances existing rights of the Indian Committee . vis-d-visr Commission as regards evidence and preparation of independent Report, and in no way impairs individuality of Commission, does actually introduce a change of substance, such as to require issue of a new Warrant. I suggest again that, as I said in my telegram of 13th June, tin; change is one of form only and not. of substance.3. I, of course, realise that you have yourself found, in your own mind, difficulties-which reinforce and perhaps outweigh the technical objections of the Home Office. I do not wish to lay undue stress on the wording in which you have expressed these-difficulties, but you will agree that I could not have put this proposal forward if I had myself felt that it did in fact affect &quot; the vital principle of the undivided responsibility of Parliament.&quot; The Commission will, to adopt Simon&apos;s words, still remain solely responsible to Parliament for the statement of the effect upon their own minds of the investigation as a whole. The responsibility of Parliament will not be affected by the fact that the Committee will sit with the Commission as co-opted members to examine material and evidence, and that its Report will be submitted to the King-Emperor direct.The full responsibility of Parliament could only be impaired if the Indian Legislature were given any share in arriving at the final decision: and neither the co-option of its Committee to, sit with the Commission, nor the change in the manner of presenting the Committee&apos;s Report, can alter the fact that the decision lies wholly with Parliament.I would myself hope that the fact that the Report of the Committee would be presented direct to the King-Emperor would have weighty influence towards introducing caution and sobriety of expression into its recommendations. Apart from this, the feeling of loyality to the person of the King-Emperor, to which appeal would be made by recognition of the Committees through Royal Warrant, and by permitting Committee of Legislature to present Report direct to the King-Kmperor, is still the most powerful single factor in India, even amongst the political elements.4. I appreciate your difficulty in presenting to the Cabinet a proposal which involves a change, though, as I hold, by no means a vital change, in its original decision. But surely you are not correct in thinking that no change has occurred in the interval since that decision which Avould justify placing my proposal before it.It is not merely directed to meeting an unknown situation which may confront us two or three years hence, though personally I should regard it of great importance to
-attempt anything which might, and in my judgment would, if successful, improve atmosphere in which India is likely to receive decision of Parliament. A situation actually exists to-day which may greatly hamper the Commission in presenting to Parliament that faithful account of opinions and aspirations prevalent in India to which Simon referred in February last, and which is likely to encourage permanently unfavourable reactions upon the general course of Indian political thought. I imagine that Parliament itself would, when the time comes, feel far more secure and perhaps be more (sic) unanimous in passing judgment on the recommendations of the Commission, if it knew that they were the result of an enquiry in which the Committee representing the Central Legislature and the Provincial Councils had been willing to co-operate, and I feel confident that, if my proposal could obtain your sanction and sufficient support here to warrant its adoption, it avouM have a powerful influence upon the future development of Indian political opinion.5. It is matter for great regret to me to find myself differing from you on important issues, and I would gladly, if I could, acquiesce forthwith in your view. I appreciate, of course, that without your sympathy it is probable that if you consulted the Cabinet they would have grave doubts about accepting my suggestions. And it is, therefore, on no personal grounds that I am tempted to press you to place the Cabinet in possession of my feelings.But I am sufficiently impressed with the desirability of avoiding the development of a situation in India which we may later regret, and I think that there is enough prospect of my proposals effecting this result without, as I believe, the sacrifice of any essential point of our position, to constrain me to urge their reconsideration at your hands, and to make me feel that, whatever view they may take, the Cabinet should be informed of the views, I hold.I would, therefore, ask you again to consider the suggestions in the light of the further observations I have made. I would hope that after such consideration you might feel able to recommend them to your colleagues, but in any case, in justice to the issues involved and the responsibilities of those whose mind, along with my own, my proposals reflect, I would ask that you might allow Cabinet to be seized of my appreciation of the situation as I have endeavoured to set it out in this and my preceding telegram No. 363 S, dated 13th June. If they, after deliberation, and with benefit of your counsel, decide in a sense adverse to what I have urged, I shall, of course, accept your and their decision loyally.6. This telegram was on point of despatch when your telegrams Nos. 1764 and 1765 of 25th June arrived, and I held it up until I had time to consider how far my judgment was affected by those telegrams. I think, however, that I have dealt above with all the points raised by you, and that I need not add anything except to emphasise that my proposal, if investigation 1 suggest appeared to warrant its adoption, would exclude possibility of Indian wing taking part in writing Commission^ Report or having power to call for witnesses or documents on their own authority. I gather from Simon&apos;s remarks quoted in your telegram No. 1765 that these are the two chief practical objections he raised to scheme attributed to Patel, and that ii therefore precise implications of my proposals were explained to him he might not be indisposed to favour them. I am myself surprised that a technical change, which, as I have sought to show, in no way effectively adds to the powers already guaranteed to the . Committees by Simon&apos;s original letter and his. recent decision as regards evidence, should appear to offer a good chance of inducing Indian leaders to desist from boycott. But, as Simon says, the Indian mind is naturally prone to attach what to us seems an exaggerated importance to question of form, and I think it quite possible that such a change of form as I have sketched might effect valuable results of substance.From Secretary of State to Sir John Simon. Secret. India Office,My dear Simon, 28th June 1928.In my letter515 to you of the 19th June, I quoted certain passages from a . telegram! that I had then received from the Viceroy, which were relevant to the question of making some further concession in regard to evidence to be taken by the Commission. I now send you, for your information, the full text of the Viceroy&apos;s telegram. As you will see, the main object of the telegram is to put forward and argue the advantages and disadvantages of a plan propounded by Sir Chimanlal * Not printed. f Dated 13th June (CP. 200(28)).
;Setalvad for co-opting Indians on the Commission. As is stated towards the. end of my reply of the 25th June, I did not consult you in regard to this suggestion, because, it is, in my opinion, a suggestion which would fundamentally alter the character of the Commission ; it was, therefore, a matter, not for the Chairman of the Commission,, but for the Cabinet to take a decision.I have delayed sending you the copies of these telegrams until I received the Viceroy&apos;s letter of 6th J une. I enclose this* also; though it does not contain anything substantially different from the summarised statement in the telegram. Indeed, it does not go so far as the telegram does in evaluating Setalvad&apos;s suggestion.Would you very kiudly let me have these papers back as soon as you have perused them? Of the letter I have no other copy. I hope that, at the same time, you will be able to let me know that you concur in the substance of my reply to the Viceroy.Yours sincerely,The Right Hon. Bikkenhead.Sir John Simon, K.C.V.O., KG., M.P.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 4th July 1928.1841. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram, 27th June. Simon Commission. I will, of course, in response to your appeal, raise whole question in Cabinet. I had already on 22nd June communicated to them your telegram of 13th June and mine of 20th, and so far no one has told me that he differs from my view. In now inviting discussion I should wish to be able to support you, but I must confess that material supplied by your last telegram still does not convince me, and object of present telegram is to elicit further what is in your mind. I leave aside for the moment the constitutional aspect, which I am exploring further as you request, but I would say at once that I am sorry if wording of my telegrams suggested that I thought you were consciously proposing to infringe vital principles. You had indeed emphasised that you thought your proposal was within main structure of our scheme. But in that opinion I differed from you and my only purpose was to make that clear.Following are main points which I should like you to develop :  (1) What has occurred since the Commission left India, or indeed since Simon wrote his memorandum for Cabinet a month ago, to make further concession necessary?   Do we know anything now which we did not know when he wrote the last words quoted in my telegram 1765 ? (2) If the concession about in camera evidence has not mollified leaders, is not this clearly because they know that you are considering Setalvad&apos;s proposal, and are therefore expecting something more ?   I am told that three weeks ago Wilson, of Pioneer, telegraphed that you had told him that important 1 &apos;    new move was likely.    This is doubtless not strictly true, but suggeststhat people have been talking. (3) If concession already made brings Provinces in, will not this rob politicians whom you have in mind of much of their sting?   Will it not force upon rational elements necessity for co-operation of Central Legislature ? (4) What precisely do you expect these politicians to do, or undertake to do, if further concession is made ? (5) If insistence of politicians on what in yowv eyes is merely a matter of form is surprising, is not presumption that in their eyes it is a great deal more than matter of form. ?With further information on these points 1 will go to Cabinet, and I can assure you that my great desire is to find that, as in the past, so in this matter we see eye to eye. But equally, I owe it to you to make it plain that I am at present quite unconvinced by your proposal.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 4th July 1928.1842.   Private and personal.    I have now considered further para. 2 of your private and personal telegram dated 27th June, regarding technical objections of Home Office.   I doubt whether you have appreciated essence of their objection, which &apos;.is that it is not possible for a person or body of persons not holding the King&apos;s* Not printed.
Commission to report to - the King on a matter remitted lor enquiry to a Royal Commission; and King&apos;s Commission can only issue to such person by name, i.e. he-must be appointed by name in Royal AY arrant. In this particular case, farther, owing to provisions of section 84a, Government of India Act, their names would have-to be approved in addition by both Houses of Parliament.Home Office have not overlooked decisions relating to Islington and Linlithgow Commissions, to which you refer, and other instances of co-option, but &quot; co-option of members &quot; and &quot;appointment of Assistant Commissioners &quot; resorted to there affords-no precedent for what you propose. Islington&apos;? &quot;Assistant Commissioners&quot; and Linlithgow:s &quot; co-opted members &quot; were appointed for strictly limited purpose of assisting Commission by their technical or local, knowledge in &quot;raising points for discussion, eliciting evidence and examining witnesses.&quot; They took no part at all in Commission^ deliberations or in framing conclusions or drawing up report. There would be nothing inconsistent with the Warrant in introducing principle of co-option provided that co-opted members were to be utilised by Commission in a strictly subordinate capacity, but if any other persons than seven Commissioners, already appointed were to be empowered to report to the King on the same subject-matter this could only be done by making them also Commissioners. Even from the-technical point of view, therefore, the question whether Indian Committee&apos;s report reaches the King direct or as appendix to Commission^ report is one of substance-and essence.From Sir John Simon to the Secretary of Stale for India.Secret. Royal Courts of Justice,My dear Birkenhead, . 4th July 1928.I can new reply to your secret letter of 28th June. I return, as requested, the-Viceroy&apos;s letter to you of 6th June and the print of the telegrams between you of 13th June and 20th June.I am very glad, if I may say so, that you carried this matter through to a decision before consulting me and have told the Viceroy so; for, as you truly say, this is a Cabinet question, and I think the position of the Commission and its Chairman ought to be that they have undertaken a very heavy responsibility within the framework of the Cabinet&apos;s scheme, and are not themselves called upon to consider whether the framework should be altered. But at the same time I want to say that, having read the papers with a great deal of care, I entirely agree with your view. I can. summarise my own feelings on the subject as follows :  (1) &quot;These  tentative  suggestions   of Setalvad do  not  inspire me  with much confidence.   Just before I left India at the-end of March, I had messages from Leslie Wilson that Setalvad was anxious to see me and had. suggest to as to make.   He represented, to Wilson, that he was acting in close touch with Thakurdas, Sapru,. Jinnah and Jayakar (the very same names as the Viceroy recites) and expected to-bring these others along with him.   i replied, stiffly, that I would be glad to see him if he wished to see me, but that it was for him to make the application.   He never-screwed up the courage to ask to see me at all, and in the event there seemed to be very little reason to suppose that he was in a position to speak for the others whom he named.   There is nothing new in the suggestion that Indians should be co-opted to-work with the Commission; Patel made the suggestion to me in Delhi and I replied that 1 did not see how this could be brought about without a new resolution in Parliament and a reopening of the question of the constitution of the Commission,, both of which were impracticable.(2) 1 hope very much that the Viceroy is right in his view that these conversations with Setalvad will be treated by that gentleman as so absolutely in confidence that . no impression is created in the minds of others that something is doing and they only have to stand out to get a substantial concession.    The prospect of getting Committees appointed by the provinces (Bengal on 9th. July, Bombay on 1st August, &amp;c.) entirely depends, I think, on no encouragement being given to the idea that the situation is fluid in this respect.   This is all the more important now that we,have made a- concession on the so-called &quot;in camera&quot; point.   lean hardly suppose that &apos; Setalvad, when asked by the Viceroy to draft amendments to the Letters Patent,-did , not consult others, and I am seriously perturbed at the possible reaction of all this on the impending debate in the Bombay Council about co-operation with the Commission.. I Lave this morning seen a telegram from the Viceroy to me reporting that Leslie Wilson now takes a rather gloomy view of the prospects in Bombay in this respect.
(3) I think you would be interested to read the appreciation * which Goatman, the Director of Public Information in India, sent me for niy personal information by the mail just arrived; this was written just before we made our &quot;in, camera&quot; announcement. If you read in conjunction with this the appreciation! Which the Viceroy has just cabled, after the announcement was made, I think we have good reason to hope that the prospect of Committees in some of the provinces has been substantially iinproved. Don&apos;t let us spoilit then by creating new doubts as to where we stand.(4) Assuming that most of the other provinces follow the example of the Punjab and appoint Provincial Committees, the really important practical question is, I think, what should be done about the Legislative Assembly ? At present it has resolved, by a small majority, against co-operation. I am a little surprised to read in the Viceroy&apos;s telegram to you (para. 7 (6)) that, even if this decision could be reversed by a narrow margin, the Viceroy doubts whether it would be desirable to bring up the question in that Chamber again. The argument that, if the motion were carried by a small majority, selection would have to be from an &quot; unrepresentative rump&quot; does not appeal to me, as if resort is had to nomination exactly the same difficulty arises. The Council of State has resolved to co-operate and must be given the opportunity of doing so. I should have thought, if: a majority cOuld be. secured in the Lower House for co-operation, this was undoubtedly &apos;a great point gained, and, though J. am not hopeful of this result, it seems to me a possibility if the provinces come in and no false hopes are rained about further concessions. On the other hand, if the impression gets about that modifications in the Letters Patent are possible, this will shipwreck the chances of provincial co-operation and will minimise the value of our concession about in camera, evidence. The proper tactic is to make much of this last concession and to spread the view that it meets a real difficulty and creates a new opening.Yours sincerely,The Rt. Hon. the Earl of Birkenhead. John Simon.* Not printed.t There seems to me to be rather a striking change of tone between this appreciation of the Viceroy sand his telegram to you of 13th June. .T.S.From Viceroy, 6th July 192S.Private and personal. I have received your telegrams 1841 and 1842. I am grateful to you for the thorough consideration you have given to my proposals and for agreeing to place them before Cabinet.I am bound to admit force of Home Office arguments on technical point, which were not absent from my mind when. I sent my earlier telegrams. On the particular point that concerns section 84a, I of course recognise that to get names of Indian Committee approved by Parliament is out of the question and I do not suggest it. I should have thought there was sufficient distinction in fact between position and powers of Statutory Commission and those contemplated for members of Indian Committee to rob section S4a of full implications and effect. If, however. Home Office objections are held to be over-riding and final there is evidently no more to be said, unless you and the Cabinet feel that wider considerations of policy are concerned which might justify departure from cogent (sic) constitutional practice.2. Provided you and they were satisfied on policy, I should hope that some method could be found of surmounting the technical objection, and I therefore take main points you invite me to develop :-Point (i). The substantive change as I see it in the position now as compared with that when Simon left India is that there is now for the first time a chance of -our being able without sacrifice of essentials to detach substantial all-India elements from boycott. Up to the time Simon left, as he said in his paper to Cabinet, no proposal had emerged which did not break down through insistence on full equality for Indian Committee whether through their being empowered to sign Commission^ Report, or through their probable claim to exercise equivalent powers in the way of sending for persons and papers. In the circumstances then prevailing I should have -certainly associated myself with his conclusion to which you refer, -* that it is best to wait upon events and avoid all semblance of a departure at present.&quot; But fact that there is now a chance of detaching from boycott further political sections which would tacitly abandon claims hitherto made seems to constitute a new situation which we should be unwise to ignore.
3. Point (ii).-So far as I can judge from what has appeared in the Press, there is no reason to suppose that leaders are maintaining present attitude in expectation of further concession. They, no doubt, want it and hope that they may get it; but I do not think, if no further concession were given, that we should get them in merely on the concession about in camera evidence. The only suggestion I have seen in the Press that in camera evidence concession was forerunner to other concession of greater importance was a telegram recently published in Forward, to the effect that Indian leaders, including apparently Jinnah, were conducting important negotiations in London in which India Office was interested. This, like Wilson&apos;s reported reference to myself, would seem the sort of rumour that interested parties-in a situation such as the present are sure to put into circulation, and I have been surprised that there was not much more of the same kind.4. Point (iii). If provinces come in on concession already made as regards evidence,, this will, of course, indirectly tend to affect favourably all-India opinion. But situation in United Provinces, Bombay and Central Provinces is, as I have told you,, insecure,, and even where we carry motions for Committees, it makes a considerable difference whether we do so by substantial majority with substantial non-oflicial support or by narrow margin with help of official vote in co-operation only with Moslems.5. Point (iv). I would hope that my proposals might secure co-operation of certain-representative leaders whose abandonment of boycott would inevitably affect general political conditions under which Commission will work. I shxrald also anticipate that apart from positive advantage of breaking the boycott, this would mean that organised Hindu political bodies now standing aloof would come forward to put their views before the Commission. You realise, I hope, that, as I said in my telegram of&quot; 13th June, I should propose to take definite assurances from politicians before-announcement was made. Indeed, the whole of my proposals are contingent on our-being satisfied that they will produce results and are intended to be used as a basis-for securing guarantees.6. Point (v). Indians approach this question from a different angle from yours, and mine. The x^oliticians we have in mind are keenly and mainly desirous to find means of saving their faces, and first thing they would be likely to do would, of course, be to make as much as th.ey could of the concession they had obtained. We want, surely, to get them in if we can, and if our concession leaves the essential framework of our scheme intact, I should feel we had gained more than they.7. I think I have covered all the ground on which you asked further information, and I do not wish to repeat arguments already used. I feel strongly what I said in para. 4 of my telegram of the 27th ultimo, that we are not merely&apos; concerned to secure a tactical advantage at the moment. You will better judge than I of probable attitude of Parliament at later stages of this b\isiness. It is evidently desirable that Indian affairs should continue to be handled by Parliament with same degree of unanimity as you were successful in securing last autumn; and I should have thought that a future Parliament might well feel more secure and therefore more unanimous in forming judgment on Simon&apos;s report if it knew that in preparing it Simon and his colleagues had been able to hear and fully weigh in personal discussion views of Indian political leaders than if his Report had been based upon. eAndence which would be represented as being partial and one-sided.
Draft telegram.. From Secretary of State lo Viceroy.Private and personal. I have now placed before the Cabinet the whole of the correspondence ending with your private and personal - telegram dated 6th July, and with their concurrence have the following decision to communicate to you.2. We fully concur in your view, indicated in para. 2 of your telegram of .13th June, No. 363 S., that no proposal, either for the reconstitution of the Commission by the addition of Indian members or for the - creation of a parallel Royal Commission consisting of Indian members, can be entertained. I need not elaborate our reasons for this view, which are well known to you. Very briefly, they centre in the fact that Parliament has deliberately decided, that the proper means of fulfilling the responsibility vested in it by Preamble to Act of 1919 in connection with inquiry required by that Act, is to require Commission to be so constituted that its Report will be a faithful presentation of the impression created by first-hand local investigation on the minds of a microcosm of Parliament itself. This object will not be secured unless the Commission^ Report is a final unambiguous and authoritative expression of the results of their IS months&apos; study and investigation. This investigation will have included the fullest possible interchange of views with Indian Committees for which our scheme made provision, and the fullest possible consideration of any proposals placed before them by these Committees, whether in the form of reports or otherwise. These Committees, in turn, will have had, for the purpose of formulating their views, the advantage of equal access with the Commission itself to all evidence, documentary or oral, tendered to the Commission from whatever source.3. The fatal objection in our view to your plan of substituting for the Central Legislature^ Committee working on such a basis, a body of persons not chosen by the King (and not responsible to Parliament), but equally charged by him with the duty of reporting to him direct on same matters as the Commission, is that it alters fundamentally the conception of the Commission^ duties and functions which was deliberately adopted last November ; for (assuming, as is more than probable, that the two reports would present different conceptions of the facts and recommend different solutions) Parliament would be faced on your plan with the task of choosing between two (or more) divergent views of facts and remedies presented by two separate bodies of advisers possessing practically indistinguishable constitutional authority. But it is of the essence of om&quot; plan to preserve intact the privilege of Parliament to have the whole result of the enquiry presented to it in the Report of the body approved by itself, and this cannot be the case if alongside of this Report is presented to His Majesty an equally authoritative presentation by another body not so approved. You describe your proposal (para. 6 of your telegram of 27th June) as &quot;a technical change which in no way effectively adds to the powers already guaranteed to Committees by Simon&apos;s original letter and his recent decision as regards evidence.&quot; But even so, our considered view is that your scheme Avoulcl change vitally and not merely technically the status of the Central Committee&apos;s (or &quot; co-opted members&apos; &quot;) Report, and with it the status of the Report of Simon and his six colleagues, which would mean the abandonment of our original conception of the Commission.4. I should add that before consulting the Cabinet I showed Simon your telegram of 13th June and your letter of 6th June, together with my reply -of 20th June, and found that his view coincided with mine.5. Since my colleagues and I regard the objections which I have stated above as in themselves conclusive, 1. have not thought it necessary to advert to the practical difficulties which your scheme seems to me to involve. As regards the question of political expediency I feel bound to tell you my clear2899B
opinion, which my colleagues share, that, so long as there prevails in Indian political circles expectation that further pressure upon His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment or Commission will produce further concession, so long will that pressure be kept up. . Our information indicates that concession regarding in camera evidence has removed the last difficulty existing in minds of reason-able persons who approached the problem with a real desire to co-operate in constructive work. As regards the residue, we see advantage in showing them that Government is prepared to do without them if, having had their chance, they have not chosen to take it. We think it should be made clear that this is our attitude, and we hope that the well-disposed will then get on with the work.
