A1. ATHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MftJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. b&quot;- Copy No._zG.P. 248(28la*&quot;T-^ CABINET.RENT   RESTRICTION.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Healthy1,    By the Expiring Laws Continuance Act of 1927 the Rent Restriction Acts were prolonged until the 25th December 1928 in England and Wales and until the 28th May 1929 in Scotland.2,     A considerable number of questions as to the Government fs intentions regarding the future of the Acts have been addressed to me in Parliament and it i3 very desirable that some announcement on the subject should be made before the House rises.3.     I am satisfied that we could not safely bring rent restriction to an end at the close of the present year and, although I think there are grounds for making oertain amendments in the law, I do not think it would be practicable to pass an amending Bill, -which must necessarily Involve several days of Parliamentary time, by Christmas,I propose, therefore, to provide for the continuance of the existing provisions in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill which it will be necessary to pass in the Autumn.4,     The Secretary of State for Scotland has seen, and concurs in, this Memorandum.23rd July, 1928.N.C .
