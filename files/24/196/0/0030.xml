[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1928.SECRET. Copy No.     28CP. 230 (28).CABINET.POSITION OF THE SOUTH WALES COAL TRADE.Need for Immediate Relief under the Scheme of Rating Reform.Copy of Letter from the Joint Secretaries to the Board of Conciliation for the Coal Trade of Monmouthshire and South Wales to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(Circulated by Direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.)The Right Hon. W. S. Churchill, MR,Chancellor of the Exchequer, London.Dear Sir, Cardiff, July 9, 1928.THE Local Members of Parliament have reported to the Owners&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Representatives the discussion at the interview which they had with you on the 13th June last, when they urged that, in any Scheme of relief under the Budget, special consideration should be given to the Coal Shipment Trade, so far as South Wales is concerned, and that such relief in the form of a reduction in Railway Rates should be given immediately.It is understood that they pointed out, both verbally and in the Memorandum which was given to you before the interview, the very serious condition of the South Wales Coal Trade, and that they intimated that unless some immediate relief were given more Collieries would close, with consequent serious increase in the number of unemployed Miners, and other classes of labour which are dependent on the South Wales Coal Trade.These forebodings have, unfortunately, materialised, as more Collieries have ceased operations since the 13th June and, in addition, notices have recently been given to some thousands of workmen at several Collieries to terminate their contracts with the object of closing the Pits.When the Members of Parliament met the Prime Minister, prior to seeing you, they handed him the enclosed list of Collieries which had closed from the 1st January, 1927, to the 31st March, 1928, in consequence of depression of trade. Such Collieries had an average weekly output of 146,370 tons and gave employment to 26,550 men.Since the 31st March, Collieries Avith a weekly output of 41,590 tons and employing 7,080 men have ceased operations, and notices to terminate contracts are now running at Collieries which produce 46,270 tons per week and give employment to 8,230 workmen. The names of the Collieries in both categories, and the number of workmen employed at each Pit, are given on the enclosed statements.These figures speak for themselves and clearly show the gravity of the sitxiation.There are also many Collieries where notices have been given to the workmen and such Collieries are working on day-to-day contracts and are liable to close on any day. Further, in several districts Pits have stopped and others are on the verge of stopping.The Owners&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Representatives are united in urging as strongly as possible upon the Government the absolute necessity of expediting the relief to be[179431
given to the Coal Trade under the Budget proposals, and of arranging that such relief shall be concentrated on the Coal Export Trade and on coal to Iron and Steel Works.It&apos; is no exaggeration to say that delay is fraught with imminent danger of the collapse of the whole Industry. Both the Owners and Workmen are unanimously of opinion that if substantial relief could be afforded to the Industry immediately, not only would the notices to the workmen which are now running be withdrawn or suspended, but that some of the other Collieries, which are now idle, would restart.The desperate condition of the Export Trade calls for immediate action on the part of the Government, as relief given at once will prevent further widespread unemployment and distress throughout the whole of Monmouthshire  and SouthWe await the favour of your reply, and if you so desire, some of the Owners&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Representatives would be pleased to wait upon you on any day, and at any time, you may name.Yours faithfully, (Signed) FINLAY A. GIBSON,THOMAS RICHARDS,Joint Secretaries.
