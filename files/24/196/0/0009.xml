[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, jPrinted for the Cabinet.      June 1928SECRET.CP- 209 (28).INDIAN   STATUTORY  COMMISSION.I circulate for the information of the Cabinet, in continuation of my memorandum of the 22nd June, CP. 200 (28), a copy of two telegrams on the subject of the reservation of the right of the Commission to take evidence in camera. The latter of the two telegrams was composed after full consultation between myself and. Sir J. Simon and his colleagues.India Office, BIRKENHEAD.28th June 1928.Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of Slate for India,dated 9th June 1928.69 (Public). Following resolution passed by the Committee of. the Legislative Council. Punjab, formed to take part joint conference Indian Statutory Commission is communicated for your information ; it has been communicated to the Commission also: &quot; The members of the Committee are strongly of opinion that it will be difficult for them adequately and properly to discharge their duties and responsibilities, if distinction is sought, to be made between the members of the Indian Statutory Commission and the members of the Committee, in the matter of the examination of witnesses or access to documentary evidence, and that conclusions based on the examination of a portion only of the evidence will not command public confidence.&quot;Telegram from Secretary of Stale to Viceroy, dated 22nd June 1928.174-5. Home Department. The Resolution of the Committee appointed by the Punjab Council to co-operate with the Indian Statutory Commission was duly communicated to the latter body and has been most carefully considered. It raises a question which also interests other Indian Committees that may be appointed under the scheme of procedure proposed by the Commission, and I therefore think it well to communicate the conclusion arrived at to you for publication. The Commission has decided to draw no distinction between its own members and members of these Committees in the respects referred to in the Resolution, so that, in the matter of the examination of witnesses and access to documents, the Commission will treat each Indian Committee, within whose scope the material in question falls, on equal terms with itself. It considers that the reservation made in Sir John Simon&apos;s letter to the Viceroy of 6th February, which in any event would have been put into effect very rarely if at all, can be adequately secured by the power which rests with the Chairman to protect any witnesses, and by his discretionaiy power to exclude the Press from the joint sittings when necessary.I think that Your Excellency will share my satisfaction at this decision.2888      75   6.28
