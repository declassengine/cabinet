Provision has been made for alternative increases of -g-d and: Id.  in the rates of contribution from each party - employer, worker and State - for those classes&apos;where such increases can appropriately be made.    The comparison between the rates recommended by the Statutory Committee and each of these alternative scales is given in the Table annexed to this Report. Contributionso30      It is obviously desirable9 having regard to the general level of wages in agriculture,to the fact that at present the agricultural    labourer pays a contribution of 9d0  a week in respect of Health and Pension&apos;s Insurance and to the increase of Id.   in this rate due to be made next January,  that the rates of
contributions for agricultural insurance should be kept as low as possible.    The 4-g-d.  contribution for agriculture .would still be markedly below the rate for the industrial scheme.    There is also the psychological point that 4-g-d does not look as bad as 5d.    Further, if it should become necessary later on to raise the rate3 it would be easier to raise it from 4^-d.  than from 5d.    As will be seen from the annexed Table, attractive rates of benefit can be provided by the addition of -g-d to the rates of contribution proposed by the Statutory Committee for the ages 18-64, and we recommend that this increase should not be exceeded and that accordingly the contributions should be those specified in Column A of the Table, hong HiringSo4.      After careful consideration, we recommend that discount rates    approximating as closely as possible to 25 per cent for yearly hi rings and 12-g- per cent for six monthly hirings should be made0    We do not agree with the suggestion that a more generous rate of discount should be allowed.    It would not, we think be reasonable or fair to other emplojrers to allow larger discounts than those proposed by the Statutory Committee, and we are advised by the Government Actuary that to increase those discounts for all classes, would mean an additional reduction in the contribution income and in the margin for the first benefit year amounting in all to a total of  28,000.    This would make a serious inroad into margins already small in relation to the estimated expenditure.
5. The important considerations to bear in mind in deciding which of the various scales of benefit should be adopted are that the rates must not be too close to wages, otherwise there would be a danger of reducing the inducement to work;    that the amount that should be paid should not be too disproportionate to the amount which agricultural workers at present receive by way of relief, and that the selection of a scale of benefit rates may well have a bearing on the rates of unemployment allowances to be subsequently settled by the Unemployment Assistance Board in respect of agricultural workers when the Unemployment Assistance Scheme comes into full operation96. It is difficult however,  to have very close regard tothese considerations in deciding upon rates of benefit,in -particular    it is almost impossible  satisfactorily to ascertain the amounts received today by agricultural workers under the Poor Law,       After careful consideration of all the circumstances, we recommend the Cabinet to a adopt the benefit scale in the Column headed  &quot;Alternative III&apos;  in the Table annexed to this Report,The Special Grant from the Exchequer..7. In order to build up a fund for the payment of benefits,the Statutory Committee recommended that such payments should not be begun until six months after contributions commenced to be paid.      Had it been possible  to  introduce  the scheme in the early part of the yeah,  this period of six months would have passed before the winter unemployment began. It is now clear that contributions cannot begin until 1st September at the earliest, and as it is obviously -desizable
to be able to pay benefit when substantial unemployment begins, it is necessary to find a means of putting the Fund in a position to meet such benefits notwithstanding that it will not have received six months yield of actual contributions.An appreciable period ef actual contribution which should be at least three months is essential for administra-tive reasons.      It appears  therefore,  that the scheme could be brought in in time to permit payment of benefit in the coming winter if contributions could be       imposed as from 1st September or thereabouts, and in that event we understand that the Exchequer will render the assistance necessary to enable the Fund to start with an adequate balance in hand.80 On this understanding and assuming 1st September as of contributions the date of commencement/we recommend that the specialExchequer contribution which would be in respect of thethree months, June,  July and August,  should be based on theprinciple of taking a sum equivalent to the contributionsproperly payable - by employers,  employees and theExchequer - for the three months September, October and november,,9. We also recommend that the credits to be given to individual claimants in respect of July and August, should be based upon the production of a stamped current contribution card for Health and Pensions for that period supported by a declaration from the claimant that the employment in respect of which the  stamps were affixed was in agriculture;    the contribution credit not to exceed the number of weeks for which Health,  etc.  contributions were paid during the period.      In regard to the month of
ii U *3June, it should he possible to rely upon a declaration as to employment,    which could he substantiated (possibly in a -percentage of cases only) by the production of the man&apos;s Record Card or bjr reference to his Approved Society,,      In respect of claims made after December, 1935 s probably it will be necessary to refer to the r ecords of Approved Societies to check the claimantTs declaration as to employment in agriculture prior to the stamping of an Unemployment Book under the new scheme,10.        If it is decided to proceed with an unemployment insurance scheme for agriculture there remains the important question whether the introduction of the Bill embodying the scheme should be deferred until after decisions have been reached and announced i:n regard to the Unemployment Assistance Regulationso      This question involves major considerations of policy and we have agreed that it should be reserved for the Cabinet.11.        Our conclusions and recommendations are as follows:.-(1) Contributions.The scale of contributions should be that given in Column A of the annexed Table i.e.  the addition of -gd to the rates of contribution proposed by the Statutory Committee for the ages 18 to 64.(2) long Hirings.Discount rates approximating as closely as possible  to 25 per cent,  for yearly hirings and 18-g- per cent, for six monthly hirings should be made(3) Benefits.The benefits should &quot;be those set out in the column headed &quot;Alternative III11 in the annexed Table.
Signed on behalf of the Committee.JOHN CILMOUR.Chairman.2,  Whitehall Gardens,  S0W.1J 12th April,  1935.On the assumption that contributions will be payable from the 1st of September, so as to permit payment of benefit in the coming winter, the Exchequer will render the necessary assistance to enable  the Fund to  start with an adequate balance in hardy      This assistance should be determined in the manner indicated in paragraphs 3 and 9 of this Report,(5) If it is decided to proceed with an unemployment insurance scheme for agriculture^  it will be for the .Cabinet to dscide the question of policy whether the introduction of the necessary legislation should be deferred until after decisions have been reached arid announced in regard to the Unemployment Assistance Regulations,
