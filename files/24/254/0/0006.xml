THIS&apos; TOCUMENT IS^jE,^^^Y^Xgg-^M!^I^-M^STY&apos;s GOVEBKIENT.eorgt. P. 51(35).CABINET.Copy No.Water Policy.Memorandum^ by the Minister of Health.It will be remembered that the Cabinet decided (cabinet conclusions 39 (34), No.9) that I should prepare and submit a Whiteand that I should then present the White Paper to Parliament and move for its consideration by a Joint Select Committee of both Houses, in the light of whose report a Bill would be eventually prepared.I now submit the proposed White Paper for the general approval of my colleagues.The proposals which involve major qtiestions of policy are set out in the body of the Paper.     More detailed proposals for a new waterworks clauses code and for the amendment of the general law have been collected in two Appendices,paragraph 2 of the Paper,     Their central purpose is to entrust to the Ministry of Health, as central coordinating authority, adequate poy/er to ensure the proper planning of water supplies, control of sources of supply in the public interest, and rationalisation of areas of supply. Incidentally a change of system is proposed for assessing compensation water in streams.     It is proposed to simplify the procedure for obtaining water powers:    and to modernise and emend the Waterworkscolleagues to the following proposals in the Paper:-Power to the Minister himself to appoint regional Advisory Committees and their functions in default.      (Section 12)Power to the Minister to schedule areas and controlPaper summarising the measures contemplated in respect of Water Supplies,The objects of the proposals involving policy are stated inClauses Acts and the general lav/ of water supply.It may be useful if I call the particular attention of myaccess to water supplies therein.(Section 13(1))Water undertakers to be enabled to acquire waterrights by Special Order.(Sections 17 and 27).
Power to the Minister to constitute joint boards for supply (Section 19(1)) and adjust areas of supply (Section 19(2)).The above are the key proposals for carrying out the line of policy referred to above.The procedure by Joint Select Committee will ensure a thorough ventilation of all forms of opinion on these proposals before we finally approve a Bill.I expect the criticism that too much power is given to the Minister, and that the coordinating authority should be something other than his sole discretion.      In practice I am confident that the administration will work best on that basis and I shall hope to make that view prevail before the Select Committee,,As is stated in the draft White Paper most of the detailed proposals, as distinct from the large points of policy, are based on recommendations made by the Ministry of Health Advisory Committee on Water Supplies.     In these circumstances I think it will be advisable that the Committee should see the White Paper before actual publication.(Intld.) 3. II. Y.8th March, 1935.
J^PCSALg.......K)K   WATER.....IKGISLATION1.      IFTROPUUTIOI?1.     His Majesty&apos;a Government have considered the measures required for the hotter conservation and organisation of water resources and supply, and it appears to them desirable that the proposals set out in this Paper should ho considered with a view to legislation, opportunity being given to interested parties to make representations on theme     It is their intention to invite the two Houses of Parliament to set up a Joint Select Oommittoe to consider the proposals and to report upon them, and after the report has been laid and considered to introduce legislation. Objects of -policy .     Oil the present basis of organisation, our water services areconducted by the water undertakers, public and private, with marked-efficiency;   but that basis is the result of piece-meal growth rather-than of deliberate planning.     In order that water undertakers may be in the best possible position to render effective service to the public ^ the basis of organisation stands in need of rationalisation in accordance with modern conditions.The following, it Is considered, should be the objects ofpolicy:-More effective planning of future schemes of water supply, particularly by undertakers with common interests in sources of supply.Better conservation and organisation of water resources, by better control of access to sources of supply, and by the rationalisation of administrative areas, so as to secure more effective and economical distribution and use of water resources.The mare equitable distribution of water in streams and rivers between water undertakers and. other interests.Readier means of obtaining the necessary powers for carrying on water undertakings;   and the modernisation of the existing law. Briand water survey3.     Such measures as those contemplated in the present proposals must be based upon the best knowledge obtainable as to our water resources.
For this provision has already &quot;been made.   A comprehensive inland water survey is being undertaken for Great Britain, and a committee of persons with scientific and practical experience has been appointed by the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland with the duty of advising on the survey,  on the progress of the measures undertaken,  and on further measures required, and of making an annual report on the subject.    The object of the survey is to collect reliable records especially of river flows and underground water supplies,  and to correlate them,  so that fuller information of water resources may be gained.    The information required for the purposes of the survey will be obtained from water undertakers, catchment boards,  and other bodies and persons,  and it is intended that measures shall be taken to encourage the keeping of the necessary records where they are desirable but are not now kept.Advisory Committee&apos;s reports4.     The Ministry of Health&apos;s Advisory Committee on Water, comprised of men of vo.de experience in water administration, have issued reports dealing with some of the matters referred to above.    In a report issued in 1925 on underground waterK they made recommendations for the better conservation of underground water resources;    and in a report issued in 1930/V they concluded that the present method of assessing compensation water (that is,  the quantity of water which has to be passed down a stream impounded for water supplies),  first adopted seventy years ago, operates unfairly on water undertakers in many instances and results in a waste of water resources,  and proposed an alternative method.    A further report issued by the Committee in 1929^ reviewed the existing law .vMinistry of Health.    Advisory Committee on Water.

relating to water supply and included recommendations for modernisingthe law and for simplifying the machinery whereby water undertakerscan obtain powers to carry out their obligations.The5 recommendations of the Committee are substantiallyincluded in the proposals set out in this Paper.The recent drought5.The drought to which the country has recently been subjectedhas provided a crucial test of water supplies.It was the most severesince comprehensive records have been kept.     During the period April 1935. to November 1934 the average rainfall for the country as a whole was hut 78 per cent, of normal and, during the most critical months of October to March 1933/34, it was hut 71 per cent, of normal.     The result of this experience has been to show that urban water supplies generally are good, but it has emphasised the need of measures for the better organisation of the basis of those supplies.6.     With few exceptions, urban water undertakers have met the drought without any serious hardship.     Economies have had to be effected in many towns and also in a number of places emergency supplies provided, for which purpose the Water Supplies (Exceptional Shortage Orders) Act, 1934, has proved very useful.     But with few exceptions neither economies nor emergency supplies have caused any grave inconvenience.7.     On. the other hand the drought emphasised the weakness of rural supplies.     The trouble in rural areas, except in a few cases, is not lack of sources but lack of means, the revenue obtainable being small compared with the cost of schemes.     His Majesty&apos;s Government have provided a sum of one million pounds to aid rural schemes.     The County Councils and Rural District Councils were empowered to help schemes by the Local Government Act, 1929, and are nor/ freely exercising these powers.     By these measures the long lag in permanent rural supplies is being overtaken35.sSince the Act authorising the million pounds was passed on the 28th March last, grants have been provisionally allocated to schemes in 1000 parishes, of an estimated capital cost of  2,800,000;   additional rural schemes are being steadily submitted.     In addition, since April 3ast, loans to the total of  500,000 have-: been auctioned for rural schemes which are being undertaken without central grant, though with aid in some cases from local sources.The magnitude of this effort is shown by comparison with the average annual amount sanctioned in loans for rural schemes of water supply during the preceding ten years, which was only  425,000, and this includes a period when substantial grants were being given for schemes to relieve unemployment.
8*     Summarising recent experience we may say that the drought has shown the practical efficiency of our water services, given the present basis of organisation, but it has also emphasised the fact that that basis is capable of improvement.    In view of the steadily increasing demand for water, which results particularly from a rising standard for the amenities of life,  it is of practical importance to place the organisation of water services on the most efficient basis; and it is to that end that these proposals are directed.II.     PLANNING   OF   WATER   SUPPLIES9.     There are ample water resources in this country to meet any likely future demands;    the problem,  apart from means,  is the use of the resources to the best advantage.    The laying of trunk mains for conveying water is very costly;    this is a dominating factor in deter-mining policy in water supplies, and emphasizes the need for conserving resources.    It is the practice, and it must be so for the economical use of resources,  to secure that the needs of an area shall first be met by the use of. suitable sources near at hand.   A source farther afield should be appropriated.only if it is quite clear, so far as can reasonably be forecasted,  that it will not be required for a population nearer to the source.    Otherwise a town with a suitable source nearby might have to go unnecessarily far afield for water at heavy expense. In a number of areas,  however, there are no sources remaining available near to the towns and it is becoming necessary to look farther and farther afield for suitable sources, bringing a larger measure of common interest and possible conflict between adjacent water undertakers.10. Systematic measures are in consequence increasingly necessary for planning water supplies. A careful estimate is needed for a number of years ahead of the probable demand for water in each area. This is not an easy task, because account has to be taken of changes in popula-tion, industry and the demand for water; but it is necessary if proper allocation of supplies is to be assured.
It is particularly necessary for large water undertakers, whose schemes may require ten or even more years for completion.   When needs have been ascertained, it is then necessary to allocate for those needs the most suitable and the most economical sources, which may be local or,  especially for large&quot;undertakings, distant sources.    It must be considered what areas can best be supplied as independent units and, on the other hand, what areas should combine for common supply either in bulk or in detail, or should co-operate in other ways,- as by interconnections to meet emergen-cies.   Whether the balance of advantage lies in the utilisation of a particular source by an individual undertaker or by a combination of under-takers is a question requiring detailed investigation and well thought-out forecasts of the trend of development and future needs. Regional Advisory Committees11.    To do the work of planning to the best advantage it may be desirable, especially where there are a number of urban areas close together, to arrange that one common body should ascertain needs and formulate plans for a region so that areas likely to have a common problem, either in supplies or in distribution, may be brought under common review.    The first necessity is to ascertain the right units for regional action and then to secure the setting up of an appropriate body to ascertain the future needs of the region and how they may best be met.    Right conclusions in this matter can be reached only after a great deal of detailed investigation and with exact knowledge of local conditions,  and the local undertakers who are engaged in the supply of water should co-operate together in taking the primary part in the work.,The Ministry of Health have in this connection followed the policy of stimulating the formation of Advisory Regional Water Committees. Eight of these Committees have been formed, which include the areas of some 300 undertakers, with a population of 14,000,000.    It is the business of the Ministry to correlate the conclusions of various committees in order to secure that steps are taken for considering the common problems and for formulating t;he necessary planso
12.    To facilitate this work on &quot;behalf of good planning some additional powers are required as follows:-(l)    In order to assure that Regional Committees are appointed where required,  the Minister should be empowered himself to appoint Regional Committees,  and in case of default himself to under-take the work at the cost of the Authorities.    He should also be empowered to add new members to an existing Regional Committee, or in other ways to change its constitution or area, if that be necessary for the proper preparation of plans.(2)   Each Regional Committee, if it is to fulfil its functions, should prepare a plan or plans for supplying the future needs of areas within the region where additional supplies will be required, or should see that such plans are prepared by the several water undertakers, either individually or in common, as circumstances may require.    To this end, the Minister should, be enabled to require the submission of proposals from Authorities or Committees, as the case rosy be, the proposals to be submitted within a time specified by him.(3)    The Minister should be empowered to require all undertakers to keep and to furnish such statistics as he may find it desirable to prescribe in the interests of good water administration.    He already has the power for local authorities under section 284 of the Local Government Act,  1933.(4) Regional Committees have no power to require information from water undertakers. It is desirable that this power should be given.(5)    The expenses of&apos; Regional Committees are small.    The Committees should be enabled to raise on an equitable basis the small sums required.    For this purpose they should be empowered, where voluntary arrangements cannot be made,  to issue precepts on constituent authorities.    If it be considered that some safeguard is needed to assure that the precepts are reasonable and on an equitable basis,  the exercise of the power can be made subject to the sanction of the Minister of Health.
if ^III.    SOURCES OF SUPPLY 13.    The arrangements outlined in the preceding paragraphs vd.ll, it is considered provide a sound foundation on which a national policy can be built, by ensuring systematic and co-ordinated planning of future water supplies in such a way as to show how needs for water can best be met in the interests of the community as a whole.It remains to ensure observance of the plans.   V/hen for example a source of supply has been proposed for one area in a plan there must be some means of ensuring that the source shall not be used for another area merely because the latter needs an additional supply before the former-   Further, some means are required to conserve sources of supply and protect them against pollution in the public interest.    Unless these objects are secured,, the purpose of systematic planning may be defeated.The following measures are proposed to secure these objects:-(l)   Power to be given to the Minister to make Special Orders35 scheduling any area within which the conservation of water resources, surface or underground, for public supply is of public interest, an Order to be made only after public inquiry.   Within any scheduled area the water resources not to be drawn upon without the consent of the Minister, except by an owner of land for his own domestic purposes or for agriculturen    The Minister to have power to give consent with or without conditions, but a public inquiry to be held, if requested, before he refuses consent or gives consent subject to conditions; and consent not to be refused unless, the Minister is satisfied that the public needs for water will be prejudicially affected. (2)   Power to be given to the Minister to make regulations for preserving the purity of water supplies where special measures are required, the regulations to provide for the payment of compensation for any injury arising from the enforcement of the regulations.    This^&quot;Special Order&quot; where used In this Paper means an Order made by the Minister which,  if opposed and the opposition is not withdrawn, requires confirmation by resolution of both Houses of Parliament, and &quot;Order of the Minister&quot;,  an Order which becomes operative when made by the Minister,
provision is required in addition to the provisions of the next succeeding paragraph conferring powers on individual water undertakers, because it may not always be practicable, e.g. in the case of important underground water resources drawn on by a number of water undertakers, for effective remedial measures to be taken by the individual under-takers.(3)   Water undertakers to be given powers (already possessed by someunder Special Acts) to protect their supplies from pollution by the acquisition of land in the neighbourhood of their sources of supply, by restrictions on its use, or by requiring particular measures of drainage, proper compensation being made in respect of any interests injuriously affected.(4)   All water undertakers to be required to submit any proposals for new supplies to the Minister.It is not suggested that water undertakers should be debarred from applying direct to Parliament by Private Bill for power to acquire new sources of supply, but that where it is their intention to do so they should first submit their proposals to the Minister and not take measures for introducing a Bill until the Minister has notified them of his views 0In this way, continuity of policy can be secured. Underground water14.    Some further measures are needed in respect of underground supplies.   Surface water - from rivers, streams, and springs - forms the chief source of supply in this country, about three-quarters of the population being thus provided.   Moreover, because of the much improved methods of purification evolved in recent years, greater use is being made, and can still be made, of water abstracted from the lower reaches of rivers, a very important fact for water supplies.   Underground water, however, is a valuable source of domestic water supplies in many areas, e.g. those on the chalk in Kent and the Bunter Sandstone in Nottinghamshire, where it forms the only readily available source for large populations.,
There is urgent need of protecting underground supplies, and for this purpose some additional measures are necessary in addition to those already mentioned.   Under present conditions there is often waste and pollution of these supplies which cannot be adequately prevented under the existing law.    This unsatisfactory state of affairs operates unfairly on public water undertakers and is detrimental to the conserva-tion of underground supplies,15.   Public water undertakers are subject to control in the abstraction and use of underground water for public supplies.   When they seek powers by Bill for the purpose, it is the practice of Parliament to confine them to specified sites for wells or borings.    Similar proposals by local authorities or water boards proceeding under the Public Health Acts ordinarily come before the Minister of Health in connection with an application for the necessary consent under those Acts to borrow money for works.    Injurious competitive boring or pumping between public water undertakers is thus checked.   Moreover, protection can be given to the water supplies of private individuals or industries and Parliament, in authorising the abstraction of underground water by water undertakers, frequently places the undertakers under obligation to compensate the owners of neighbouring wells injuriously affected.On the other hand, under the common law owners of land have unfettered rights in all water under their land which does not flow in defined channels.    They may abstract unlimited quantities fortheirown use or for use in their businesses or for sale to others,  and they may allow any water not required by them to run to waste.    If they sink shafts through water bearing strata for obtaining coal or other minerals they are under no obligation to line the shafts or otherwise to conserve the supplies in the water-bearing formation;    and frequently large quantities of water are pumped to waste or gain access to the lower workings and become contaminated.Neither public water undertaker nor private owner has a remedy against a neighbour who deprives them of water under their land by competitive boring, or who pollutes their supplies by the deposit or discharge of substances which foul the subsoil in the vicinity of their
land, unless they can prove, usually an impossible task, the precisesource of pollution.16.     The proposals to remedy this unsatisfactory position, inaddition to those outlined in paragraph 13 above, are:-(1)   Provision to be made that, if any new mine is sunk in an area scheduled by the stor under the provisions referred to inparagraph 13(1) above as an area where underground water should be conserved, such measures shall be taken as are agreed by the Minister and the Secretary for Mines for conserving water in thestrata where the water can be conserved without interfering witn the winning of the mineral.     Only aaoh measures to be required as are necessary for preventing waste of water supplies which should be conserved.     Ar. Inquiry to be held, if requested, before any decision is reached on proposed measures.(2)    It should be made an offence to allow underground water to run to waste from borings.(,o)   The provisions of sections 61 and 62 of the Waterworks Olatu-us Act, 1847, which relate to penalties for fouling streams, reservoirs, aqueducts, or other waterworks belonging to water undertakers, to be extended to the fouling of the sub-soil in the vicinity of any wells or adits of water undertakers; - provision should also be made for the protection of wells which do not belong to water undertakers by making it an offence to deposit any solid, or discharge any liquid into the sub-soil, in the vicinity of any well or adit&quot;Vso as to pollute or be likely to pollute the water in the well or adit used or likely to be used for domestic purposes. (4)    Po..;er to be given to the Minister to obtain from any private company or person such returns of the quantity and quality of water
abstracted from underground as may be considered necessary, other than in respect of water taken by a private individual for his own domestic use.    This information would be obtained from water undertakers under the provisions relating to statistics referred to in paragraph 12(3)  above. Acquisition of Water Bights.17.   Difficulties have arisen in the past because the Minister has no power to authorise the compulsory acquisition of water rights.    These can now be acquired only by Act of Parliament, apart from the temporary powers given by the Water Supplies (Exceptional Shortage Orders) Act, 1934.    For some years after the passing of the Public Health Act, 1875, it was thought that the powers of. that Act enabled local authorities to acquire water rights compulsorily by a &quot;Provisional Order, but this interpretation was later reversed.    The Ministry of Health have received many complaints that water undertakers have to incur the expense of an Act of Parliament, or have to pay an exorbitant price or abandon their proposals.    It is proposed that all v/ater undertakers should be enabled to   obtain compulsory powers of acquisition of water rights by Special Order of the Minister.IV.    AREAS OF SUPPLY AND ADMINISTRATION 18.    The foregoing sections have outlined the measures which are required to make sure that considered plans are prepared for future needs, and that the plans are carried out.    In order that water supplies may be provided in the best and most efficient manner, as part of a scheme of well considered water economy, -v. measures are in addition required to make sure that the limits of supply are adapted to prevailing conditions, that proper types of water undertakers are established, and that both authority and limits can readily be adapted to changed circumstances.
19.    For these purposes it is proposed that the following measures, which can now be effected only by Act of Parliament or Provisional Order, should be rendered possible &quot;by Special Order of the Minister:-(l) Power to authorise the constitution of a joint board for water supplies, in bulk or detail.     The Minister to be empowered to con-stitute a joint board where a joint board is required and cannot otherwise be obtained.     Also power to add to, or to alter, existing joint boards.(2) Power to the-Minister to authorise the alteration of, or to alter, limits of supply of a statutory water undertaker, whether local authority or company, where that is required for adequate and eco-nomical provision of water, any Order to contain such provisions as may be equitably required in the interests of affected undertakers^ Cases frequently arise where an area is within the limits of supply of a statutory water undertaker, but a supply has not been given to the area because of the heavy cost of laying the necessary mains in proportion to the income which can be obtained from   consumers,   and where it would be possible for the local authority of the area or some other water undertaker to carry out a scheme at much less cost. The fact that the area is within the limits of one statutory water undertaker often operates to prevent any other body from providing the needed supply.(3) Power to authorise water undertakers, whether a local authority or a company, on the request of owners or occupiers in an area outside their district or limits of supply, to -supply water in that area or&quot;V.in specified part of it or to any premises within it on such conditions as may be specified in the Order;    this power to be exercised only with the consent of the local authority within whose district and of any statutory water undertakers within whose limits of supply the area is situate, unless the consent is unreasonably withheld;    any question whether or not it is Unreasonably..withheld -to be decided by the Minister.     Where an Order is made, the
provisions of any Special Acts relating to the water undertakers should apply as if the premises were within the limits of supply of the undertakers.    If at any time after the Order is made,  the statu-tory water undertakers within whose limits of supply the premises are situate, or where there are no statutory water undertakers the local authority of the area, wish to supply the premises, they should be empowered with the consent of the Minister.to do so on giving threemonths&apos; notice to the supplying company or local authority and paying,&apos;.;to them such portion of the expenditure incurred by them outside their district or limits of supply as may be agreed or, failing agreement, determined by arbitration.     Provisions of this kind have been included in a number of recent Special Acts.(4)   Power to. authorise county councils to undertake the provision of water supplies, including power to become members of joint boards for pro-viding supplies.There is no intention of any general transfer of water powers from county district councils to county councils, and the power is required only to provide for cases where the .county council . can advantageously be made responsible for the work - and this would usually be with the consent of the district councils.s(5)   Power to authorise the acquisition of undertakings, whether by alocal authority or by a water company. Many proposals come before Parliament from time to time for this purpose, and the usual reason advanced is the improvement of water supplies.In this and other cases where terms of acquisition or com-pensation arise the proposal is that they shall be settled by an independent person or body, not by the Minister, unless both parties desire that they should be settled by him (or^someone appointed by him).x The Durham County Council is the principal member of a joint board constituted by Local Act supplving water in a large part of the county area, and the Lindsey County Council are partners in a &quot;joint board formed under- a Local Act for supplying an area of the county where water is urgently needed.
n q&amp;  IS20.    It is necessary, if there is to be a useful measure of co-ordination of responsibility for water supplies, that there should be power to require the carrying out of the necessary works, if the water undertaker is in default.    The Minister has no such power now in the case of statutory water companies but he has certain powers in the case of local authorities.     Under section 57 of the Local Government Act, 1929, the Minister may hold a local inquiry where it appears to him that a non-county borough council, urban district council or rural dis-trict council have made default in providing their district with an adequate supply of water, and, if after the inquiry he is satisfied that there has been default, he may make an Order limiting a time for remedying the default and, if this is not done within the limited time, he may make an Order transferring the powers to the county council.    In the case of county borough councils, the Minister may where complaint has been made that the council has made default in providing their dis-trict with a supply of water hold a local inquiry and, if satisfied that the council is in default; he may make an Order limiting a time for the performance of their duty, and, if the duty is not performed within the limited time, the Order may be enforced by writ of mandamus, or the Minister may appoint some person to perform the duty.      It is pro-posed that the Minister should have power to make an Order requiring sta-tutory water companies to carry out necessary works if they have failed to do so and he is satisfied after inquiry that they might reasonably be required to carry out the works;    and, if the company fail to comply with the Order, that the Minister shall be empowered to appoint some person to carry out the works at the cost of the company or to make a further Order enabling a public authority to carry out the works and to recover the cost from the company;    further that there shall be power by Special Order to transfer the undertaking to a local authority or other water undertaker if that should be necessary to ensure adequate supplies.
Vj_COMPENSATION WATS21.Most of the large water undertakers obtain supplies fromimpounding reservoirs, constructed by building a dam across a stream at a suitable point where the retention of water will form a lake. The impounding reservoir is a means of storing the winter flood waters in a stream for use in the dry seasons when the natural flow in the stream would not yield sufficient water to meet the requirements of the water undertaker.     When water undertakers seek and obtain powers for the purpose, it is the practice in the Special Acts authorising the works.to require them to send down the river or stream as compensation to the riparian interests a daily, and usually regular, flow of water of a prescribed amount.     Additional storage capacity has to be provided to meet this requirement, and. the expense of the works, almost invariably a costly undertaking, substantially increased.22.       The present method of assessing compensation water was first evolved over seventy years ago when sufficient and accurate data were not available.     The recognised normal procedure is (a) to estimate the average annual rainfall over the catchment area for as long a period as possible, (b) to reduce this amount by one-fifth in order to estimate the rainfall which might be relied upon during a period of three consecutive dry years, (c) to deduct from the remainder a number of inches of rain (usually 14&quot; to 16&quot;) as the loss due to evaporation and absorption in order to ascertain the &quot;reliable&quot; or available&quot; yield, and then (d) to divide this between the requirements of the public water supply and the river in some fixed proportion, a common allocation, being two parts to the former and one to the latter.23.       It has long been felt that the present method was unsatisfactory, and this was emphasised by the Water Power Resources Committee in their Final Report, h   The question has been investigated^Final Report of T/ater Power Resources Committee, 1921; paragraphs 256 - 262 and 315 - 316.\
i7: ,! &apos; &apos; &apos;,.v e; -i0 J-by the Advisory Committee on Water., and in their report of 1930 they recommend a new method of assessment designed to give a more equitableapportionment of the water.The present method is defective in two important respects:-(l)   Little or no account is taken of the wide differences in thecharacter of streams.     A &quot;flashy&quot; stream, where the flow in dry periods is low and the bulk of the total annual flow comes down the stream in short periods of heavy flood, is of much less value to riparian interests than a &quot;steady&quot; stream, where the flow in dry periods is comparatively high.     Yet for the same total annual flow, the &quot;flashy&quot; stream would probably receive the same amount of compensation water as the &quot;steady&quot; stream.     It frequently happens in practice that on the present method of assessment water under-takers have to pass substantial quantities of water in a regular... ..: ,flow down a stream during long periods of the year when the stream in its natural state would be practically dry, and that at their sole cost, that is, at the cost of the water consumers. (2)   There is not sufficient difference made between the amount ofcompensation water in streams little used for industrial purposes and in streams largely so used.It is the common practice to require the fixed proportion, usually one third of the &quot;reliable yield&quot;, to be given even where little industrial or other use is made or is likely to be made of the stream below the reservoir. (3)   Moreover, this requirement is made even where the undertakers im-pound only one or two of a number of tributaries to a stream, the other tributaries are not likely to be impounded (either because they will not be required for public water supply purposes or because of lack .of suitable sites for dams) and the tributaries to be impounded have little effect on the volume of the stream at the point at which it begins to be of much importance for riparian use.
24.     The Advisory Committee recommend that compensation water should be assessed by reference to the character of the flow of the stream and the user of the stream as well as to the rainfall and loss by&quot; evaporation and absorption. Briefly, their proposals are as follows:-(l)   They recommend that the present method of estimating the rain-fall which could be relied upon in three consecutive dry years by deducting 205? from the long period average rainfall over the catchment area should be continued. (2)   They found from actual records of rainfall and stream flows that the allowance of 14&quot; to 16&quot; now usually made for loss by evapora-tioh and absorption is generally too low and they suggested a formula designed to give a more accurate figure.     The estimated loss on the formula calculated for a number of rivers does not, however, differ from the present allowance sufficiently to make a material change in the amount of compensation water to be allowed, and it is considered that an allowance of 15&quot;, the average on present practice, might be made for this purpose. (3)   They suggest a method for distinguishing the character of thevarious streams.     They advocate that actual gaugings of the stream, otv flood flows as well as normal flows, should be taken over a period of at least four, and preferably seven, consecutive years either before or during the construction of the reservoir. Prom these gaugings (a) the average daily flow during the whole gauging period should be calculated, and also (b) the average daily flow on those days when the flow was equal to or less than the average for the whole period.     The ratio of the latter to the former, which they call the&quot;characteristic&quot; of the stream, gives a measure of its character.     The steadier the stream, that is, the less the proportion of the total annual flow which comes down in heavy floods, the higher will be the characteristic;    the flashier the stream, the lower will be the characteristic. The Committee found from actual records   that the characteristics of streams will be likely to lie between 0.30 and 0.48,,
They suggest that the yield from the annual rainfall on the water-shed, after the deduction of one-fifth has been made to give the rainfall in a period of three consecutive dry years and allowance made for the loss due to evaporation and absorption, should be multiplied by the characteristic of the stream to give a figure which they call the &quot;assessable flow&quot; of the stream. They then recommend that this &quot;assessable flow&quot; should be multiplied by a user factor to give the compensation water to be passed down the stream.   It was their view that approximately the same amount of compensation water should be given on the new method as on the present method to a steady stream which has the high&apos; characteristic of 0.48 and is largely used for industry, and to give this result the user factor for a stream largely used for industry is 0o70   They therefore suggest that the user factor for a stream largely used for industry should be 0.7. For a stream not used at all for industrial purposes, they suggest that the user factor should be half that for a stream largely used for industry, that is, 0.35, and the compensation water therefore half of that for a stream largely used for in-dustry of the same character025.    Summarising their recommendations, but omitting any change in the method of allowance for evaporation and absorption, the compensation water to be allowed for any stream would be the long period average rainfall over the watershed, reduced by one-fifth to give the rainfall in a period of three consecutive dry years, further reduced by 15&quot; of rain to allow for loss due to evaporation and absorption, then multiplied by the characteris-tic of the stream, and finally multiplied by the user factor, which would vary from 0.35 to 0*7 according to the use made of the stream for industrial purposes.26o   In view of the heavy cost of providing storage capacity, it is considered that steps should be taken to ensure that
compensation water should not exceed that required to meet the reasonable needs of riparian interests, and that the recommendations of the Advisory Committee., subject to the qualification referred to above, should be examined as a basis for a solution of the problem.       The proposal is that general legislation should be passed to determine the new principles on which compensation water is to be based, and that the new principles should be applied by Parliament in any Private Bills or by the Minister in any Special Orders for the assessment of compensation water in new proposals, and, further,  that where a,case is made out for revision of existing provisions on compensation water, or of future awards owing to change of circumstances or new facts, the Minister should be empowered by Special Order to vary the awards in accordance with the new principles.VI.    PROCEDURE27.     A more simple, expeditious and inexpensive procedure for obtaining powers for establishing, conducting or extending water undertakings is highly desirable.     Briefly the present position is that, under the provisions of the Public  Health&apos; Acts, local authorities may supply their own districts v/ith water (except any parts which are within the limits of another statutory water undertaker and the latter is willing and able to supply those parts) and for that purpose may construct and maintain waterworks, dig wells and do any other necessary acts; take on lease or hire any waterworks and, v/ith the sanction of the Minister&apos;,
purchase any waterworks, or any rights, powers and. privileges of any water company;of contract with any person for the supply^ water;   purchase cd? water in bulk from any local authority or statutory water company;   purchase land by agreement; and, -with the consent of the minister borrow money for the purpose. If they wish to purchase land compulsorily, they may apply to the Minister for a Provisional Oraar.     Powers are not available to them under the Public Health Acts and can therefore be obtained only by Private Bill to acquire v/ater rights compulsorily (this has already been referred to); to take water from streams or rivers unless the local authority obtain the consent of all riparian interests likely to be&apos;affected (in practice usually an impossible task);   or to supply premises outside their district (often the most economical and sensible&apos;course for the supply of areas adjoining large urban areas).     Because of the lack of powers a large number of local authorities find it necessary to apply to Parliament for powers and at the present time there are nearly 500 local authorities and joint boards working under Private Acts.28.     Companies or private persons may apply to the Minister for a provisional Order under the Gas and Water Works Facilities Act, 1870, authorising them to construct and to maintain waterworks and works connected therewith, and to supply water in any district within which there is not an existing company, corporation, body of commissioners, or person empowered by Act of Parliament to construct such works and to supply water;   to raise additional capital necessary for the purpose;    to enable two or more companies or persons to enter into agreements for a joint supply, or to amalgamate their undertakings.     Powers for the compulsory acquisition of land and, the Minister is advised, of
water rights are excluded from the scope of these Provisional Orders and can be obtained only by Private Bill.29.   Normally Special Acts and Provisional Orders obtained by local authorities, companies and others empower only the carrying out of works specified in them and such works as are purely ancillary to them,  and.confer no general power.    It is also usual in Special Acts and Provisional Orders to prohibit the undertakers from abstracting water except from land and by works specified in that or some other Act or Provisional Order.   Local authorities, water companies and others working under these special powers have therefore to obtain a fresh Act or Provisional Order when they wish to construct additional works or abstract further water from some new site or when they wish to extend their limits of supply,&apos;30.    It is proposed that the procedure be altered so that the powers which can now be obtained only by Bill or Provisional Order may be obtained by Special Order of the Minister.   The new procedure would not affect the powers already possessed by local authorities under the Public Health Acts, nor is it intended that water undertakers should be debarred from applying direct to Parliament by Private Bill if they consider it expedient to do so.    The new-procedure, however, would cover all the ordinary purposes for the establishment of an undertaking,  the acquisition of land and sources of supply,  the construction of works, the raising of capital, the purchase of undertakings by local authorities or other statutory water companies, and the amalgamation of undertakings.
VII.   MODERNIZATION OF THE LAW The Waterworks Clauses Acts, 1847 and 1865&apos;31.   The Waterworks Clauses Acts, 1847 and 1863, contain the general code which governs the conditions of water supply.    They are incorporated, with or without modification, in the Special Acts and Provisional Orders of nearly every company, local authority or joint board supplying water under special powers. Their substance is also applied to local authorities operating under the Public Health Acts, because the Public Health Act, 1875, incorporates the whole  of the Act of 1863 and those sections of the Act of 1847 which relate to the breaking up of streets, the laying of communication pipes, the waste or misuse of water, the fouling of water, and the payment and recovery of water rates.Since the Acts of 1847 and 1863 were passed, the measure and circumstances of water supplies have greatly changed, but in the absence of any general revision of the code, it has been left to the individual water undertaker, as opportunity arises,  to apply for revision of the code in its application to their under-taking. .   The result is that Special Acts and Provisional Orders, having been obtained at different times, differ much in their provisions, and the position is far from satisfactory;   but at the same time there has grown up a large body of provisions modifying the Waterworks Clauses Acts which are recognised as common form clauses.32.   His Majesty&apos;s Government is satisfied that the enactment of a new code suited to modern conditions and incorporating the best that has been adopted in recent Parliamentary practice is highly desirable and would tend to uniformity, convenience and economy.    The proposals for amending the existing code are set out in Appendix A to this Paper.    They are based on amendments commonly allowed by Parliament in Special Acts and fere substan-tially in accordance with recommendations made by the Advisory Committee on Water.
The General Law33.    In addition, there is need for amendment of provisions in the general law relating to water supply in order to bring them more into conformity with modern conditions and requirements^ His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that these modifications of the general law should be made, as specified in Appendix B*
APPENDIX AProvisions proposed to &quot;be included in the, new Waterworks Clauses CodeSupply Pipes .1.     Under the Waterworks Clauses Act, a new domestic consumer has the right,  on payment of the portion of the water charge payable in advance, to open up the ground and lay a supply pipe, of such bore, strength and material as may be prescribed by regulations of the undertakers,  to connect his premises with the main of the undertaker and to obtain a supply of water, provided that he has first obtained the consent of the owners and occupiers of the ground affected and has given the undertakers 14 days&apos; notice of his intention; and he is expressly authorised for the purpose to break up so much of any street as lies bweteen the main and his premises and any sewer or drain in the street.   He must do as little damage as possible, and pay compensation for any damage done.     The connection with the main must be made under the superintendence of the water undertakers,  subject to appeal to two Justices in cases of dispute.     The consumer who has laid the pipe, or who has become the proprietor of it, is responsible for its maintenance, and he may remove it, after due notice to the undertakers and subject to compensation for damage sustained by them.     There are now, hoever, many instances in practice where the water undertaker has assumed responsibility for the main-tenance of the portion of the supply pipe under the highway.     ^With the higher standard and cost of modern highway construction and the increased traffic on the roads, it has become desirable that interference with highways should, as far as possible, be confined to statutory and other public authorities; it is desirable also that water- undertakers should have the ex-clusive right of executing works connecting with their mains, (a provision to this effect has become common in Special Acts);
and it is inequitable that the individual consumer should be responsible for repairing damage over which he has no control and which varies, greatly as between consumer and consumer, according to the traffic use of the particular street, and nature of its surface, the position of the main and other factors.It -is proposed that the right to break up the highway for the purpose of laying the supply pipe should vest solely in the water undertakers, the undertakers being empowered to recover from the consumer the cost of the initial provision of the supply pipe, including a stopcock (with a suitable box and cover) to be placed as near as reasonably practicable to the point at which the pipe passes the boundary of the street; that the obligation to maintain all supply pipes so far as they lie under the highway should fall on the undertakers, and that the expenses involved in maintenance should be defrayed by the undertakers as part of the normal distribution costs and thus be spread over the whole body of consumers.    Parliament have recently considered this subject and provisions on the lines now proposed were included by them on the Metropolitan Water Board Act, 1932.2.     It is also proposed that -(a) power should be given to water undertakers, by agree-ment with the owner or occupier and at his expense, to execute any work which he is entitled or required to execute, the expense to be recoverable in the same manner as the water rate;(b) power should be given to undertakers to require a separate supply pipe to be provided for each dwelling house supplied by them with water, and on default to provide the separate supply-pipe themselves and recover the cost from the owner as a civil debt;(c) where several dwelling houses or parts of dwelling houses are supplied by one common pipe the several owners and occupiers should be made liable to contribute the expenses incurred by the under-takers in the maintenance, repair and renewal of the pipe in such pro-portions as may be settled by the duly authorised officer of the under-takers.
Bight to demand supply.3.   Under section 35 of the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1347, owners and occupiers of houses within the&apos;area of supply of a water undertaker may requisition a supply of water for domestic purposes if the aggregate water rates payable by them annually will not be less than one-tenth of the initial cost of providing and laying the pipes to afford the supply.    It is proposed to amend this section by the substitution of &quot;one-eighth&quot; for &quot;one-tenth&quot;.4.    Section 53 of the Act of 1847 provides that an owner or occupier of a dvrellinghou.se, who has laid a supply pipe and paid or tendered the quarterly water rate, is entitled to demand and receive a sufficient supply of water.    It is proposed to provide for a penalty of five pounds for failure to supply, and a further penalty of forty shillings for each day failure continues, except where the failure arises from frost, unusual drought or unavoidable cause or accident.Some stio Supply. 5.   Until -recently it was the almost invariable practice in Special Acts and Provisional Orders to allow water undertakers to make special charges for water closets and baths, in addition to the authorised water charge for the domestic supply.    When the Water Acts were passed, these conveniences were exceptional; now they are common and the water supply for them should be regarded as part of the normal domestic supply.    This question has been considered by Parliament recently in a number of Special Acts and they reached the conclusion that water undertakers should not be allowed to make a special charge for the first water closet or for the first bath of ordinary capacity, but that they should be allowed to make a special charge for any water closet or bath beyond the first.    It is proposed in the new code to define a supply of water for domestic purposes as a sufficient supply for ordinary domestic use, including one water closet and one bath of capacity not exceeding fifty gallons when filled to the centre line of overflow,
Domestic supplies in special cases 6. It is proposed to provide that undertakers shall not &quot;be bound to supply otherwise than by meter -(a) a dwelling house used partly for.trade or manufacturing purposes for which water is required;(b) any private or public hospital, school,  sanatorium or institution capable of accommodating at least twelve persons;(c) any boarding house capable of accommodating at least twelve persons;(d) any common lodging house,  club, hotel, public house, inn, restaurant or hydropathic establishment;(e) water required in any premises used solely for trade, business or manufacturing purposes for the personal use for sanitary purposes of persons employed therein, water for sanitary purposes meaning water used for drinking and dietetic purposes and personal hygiene and for the flushing of urinals and water closets, but not including water used for any other purpose.The water to be supplied at a price not exceeding the prescribed price, subject to a minimum quarterly charge (exclusive of meter rent) of one-fourth of the annual account which would be payable for a domestic supply furnished to a dwelling house of the same net annual value as the premises, or in the case of premises referred . to in paragraph (e), such part of the premises as may be agreed or, failing agreement, as may be determined by a Court of Summary Jurisdiction.Supply for other than domestic purposes 7.       Power to be given to undertakers to supply water for other&apos;than domestic purposes on such terms and conditions as they think fit, and to supply water for such purposes by meter, the monies payable for the supply being recoverable&apos; in the same manner as water rates.     The provison to be subject to the provisoes
(l) that no person shall be entitled to a supply of water for other than domestic purposes if the supply would interfere with the supply for domestic purposes, and (2) that the undertakers shall not be liable to any penalty or damages for not supplying such water if the failure to supply arises from frost, unusual drought, or unavoidable cause or accident, unless the agreement provides for penalty or damages, in these circumstances.     The term &quot;for other than domestic purposes&quot; to include water supplied for watering gardens; for foun-tains of any ornamental purposes; for bathing pools and swimming baths; for cattle, or for hox-ses or for washing carriages or motor vehicles, where the horses, carriages, or motor vehicles are kept for sale or hire or by a common carrier; for working any machines or apparatus, or for flushing sewers, or for road watering or for public baths; and, except for the purposes referred to in paragraph 6 i^e) above, for any trade, manufacture or business.Rates and Charges8.       Provision to be made that a supply of water for domestic purposes shall be furnished at a rate or rates per annum not exceed-ing the prescribed rate or rates per annum upon the net annual value of the premises supplied (except where agreement has been made to supply by meter) and in no case for less than one quarterly payment; that the net annual value shall be ascertained from the valuation list in force at the date when the rate is made, any supplemental valuation list having effect as if it were in force at the time the rate is made; and that&apos; any disputes as to the net annual value of premises where the net annual value does not appear in the valuation list, or as to the net annual value of the part of any hereditament entered in the valuation list where the water rate&apos; is chargeable only on that part,  shall be determined by a Court of Summary Jurisdiction.9.       Provision to be made that, where two or more houses or buildings in the occupation of one and the same company or&quot; person are connected by any internal means of communication or by any bridge subway, yard or passage,  or other moans, not being a public highway,
they shall he deemed for the purposes of domestic water rates to he one tenement, having a net annual value equal to the aggregate net annual value of the separate houses or buildings.10.       Power to be given to water undertakers to make special charges, not exceeding the prescribed charges, for water closets and baths not included in the definition of domestic supply.11.       Power to be given to water undertakers to make special charges, not exceeding the prescribed charges, where water supplied for domestic purposes is used by means of a hosepipe or similar apparatus for washing horses, carriages or motor vehicles, or for other purposes in stables, garages; or premises where horses, carriages or motor vehicles are kept.12.       Provision to be made that where any person takes a supply both for domestic purposes and by meter for trade and uses a hose pipe or other similar apparatus for washing horses, carriages or motor vehicles or for other purposes in stables, garages or premises where horses, carriages or motor vehicles are kept, the undertakers may require that all water used by means of the hose pipe or other apparatus shall be taken by meter and paid for accordingly.13.       Where a person desires to use water for a refrigerating apparatus or any apparatus depending while in use on a supply of continuously running water, power to be given to undertakers to require that all water used for the apparatus shall be taken by meter and paid for accordingly,  or to make such charges as may be agreed, subject to the proviso that, if the consumer is taking water only for domestic purposes, the undertakers may demand a ininimum quarterly payment, if the water is taken by meter, not exceeding ten shillings.14.       Section 69 of the Act of 1847., which provides that where several dwelling houses or parts of dwelling houses in the separate occupation of several persons are supplied by one common pipe, the several owners or occupiers shall be liable to pay the
same water rate as they would have &quot;been liable to pay if each of the dwelling houses, or parts of dwelling houses, had been supplied by a separate pipe, to be amended to cover other premises as well as dwelling houses.15.       Provision to be made that the more usual divisions of the financial year, the first day of January, April, July and October, shall be the dates for quarterly payments instead of those fixed by section 70 of the Act of 1847.16.       Provision also to be made that the undertakers may de-termine that the water rate shall be paid by equal half-yearly pay-ments on the first day of April and the first day of October, pro-vided that (a) the rates shall not be recoverable until the expira-tion of two months from these dates, and (b) any person who shall occupy any premises during part only of any half-year shall be liable for the part of the rates proportionate to that part of the half-year, and if he has paid a greater part, the balance shall be refunded to him by the undertakers.17.       Power to be given to undertakers to allow discounts or rebates to consumers of water in consideration of prompt payment of . rates, not exceeding in any case five per centum.18-       Power to be given to undertakers to agree with any person requiring a supply of water for domestic purposes to furnish the supply by meter on. such terras and conditions as may be agreed, the monies payable to be recoverable in the same manner as water rates. Rates payable by owners of small houses.19.       Sections 72 and 73 of the Act of 1847 provide that the owners of houses not exceeding ten pounds rent shall be liable to pay the water rates, subject (unless otherwise agreed between the owner and occupier) to recovery from the tenant where the tenant has occupa-tion under any lease or agreement made prior to the passing of the Special Act.     It is proposed to substitute &quot;thirteen pounds&quot; for the &quot;ten pounds&quot;.
Waste, misuse, undue consumption and contamination20.       Power to be given to undertakers to make byelaws for the purpose of preventing waste, misuse, undue consumption or con-decontamination  of water supplied by them and by the byclaws to prescribe the size, nature, materials and strength and the mode of arrangement connexion, disconnexion, alteration and repair of all water fittings and a power after due notice to carry out at the cost of any person failing to observe the byelaws such works as arc necessary to meet the byelaw requirements.21.       Power to be given to undertakers on request from a con-sumer, and at his cost to supply or repair, but not manufacture, water fittings; any fittings let for hire not to be subject to dis-tress or to the landlord&apos;s remedy for rent, or be liable to be taken in execution under process of any court or any proceedings in bank-ruptcy against the person in whose possession they may be, provided that the fittings have some distinguishing mark indicating the under takers as the owners.22.       Power to be given to undertakers to sell meters and fittings connected therewith.23.       Persons injuring water fittings belonging to the under-takers, or fraudulently using water, or altering any meter, or wil-fully or negligently opening, shutting off or interfering with any valve or other apparatus belonging to the undertakers whereby the supply of water is interfered with, to be made liable to a fine of five pounds; the undertakers in addition to have power to recover the amount of any damage or loss sustained by them, and to enter -on premises and repair at the cost of the offending person any injury to the fittings.24.       power to be given to undertakers to provide meters on their mains and stopcocks in the pipes supplying premises, and to insert in the roads and footways the necessary covers or boxes for giving access and protection thereto.
25.      Provision to be made that the register of any meter shall be prima facie evidence of the quantity of water consumed, any dispute as to quantity consumed to be determined by a Court of Summary Jurisdiction.     If any meter be proved, to have registered erroneously, the meter to be deemed to have registered erroneously since the penultimate date on which the register of the meter was ascertained before the date of the test, unless it is proved to have begun to register erroneously on some later date.26.      A person connecting or disconnecting any meter to be required to give to the undertakers not less than forty-eight hours&apos; notice in writing, and all alterations or repairs or connecting and disconnecting of meters to be done at his cost and under the super-intendence of the undertakers, subject to a penalty of forty shillings for an offence against this provision.27.       The powers of entry between nine in the forenoon and four in the afternoon to detect waste conferred on undertakers by section 57 of the Act of 1847 to be extended to the hours from sovon in the forenoon to one hour after sunset or nine in the afternoon, whichever is the earlier.28.       Power to be given to undertakers, for the purpose of preventing waste, to repair any supply pipe or other apparatus, after due notice, at the cost of the persons responsible for the repairs.Lands   ,29.       Power to be given to undertakers, where any authorised works are intended to be constructed underground, to acquire only the necessary easements in the lands, and to give notice to treat in res-pect of the easements; the provision of the Lands Clauses Acts to apply to the acquisition of the easements as fully as to lands.    The water undertakers not to be entitled or required to fence off or sever the lands in respect of which easements have been acquired from the adjoining lands, and the owners and occupiers for the time being to have the same rights, subject to the easements, to use and cultivate the lands as if this provision had not been made.
30. Persons empowered by the Lands Clauses Acts to sell andconvey or release lands to be given power to grant to the water undertakers any easement, right or privilege required for the pur-pose of their undertaking.31. Power to be given to undertakers to retain, hold, and use for the purpose of their undertaking for such time as they think fit any lands for the time being belonging to them, and from time to time to sell, lease, exchange or. otherwise dispose of the land, re-serving to themselves, if they so desire, all or any part of the water rights or other easements belonging to the land.32. Where portions only of certain property will be sufficient for the purposes of the undertakers and such portions can be severed from the remainder of the property without material detriment, the undertakers to have power to acquire that portion.     The question whether a portion of the property can be severed without material detriment to the remainder of the property to be determined by the Arbitrator or other tribunal under the Lands Clauses Acts or, as the case may require, the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.33. Provision to be made that in the assessment of com-pensation for the compulsory acquisition of lands, no compensation shall be awarded in respect of improvements, alterations or buildings made or interests created after a date prescribed in the Special Act or Order authorising the acquisition.34. Provision to be made that all private rights of way over any lands which the undertakers are authorised to acquire compulsorily shall be extinguished as from the date of the acquisition,  subject to compensation by the undertakers to all persons injuriously affected.55. Power to be given to undertakers by agreement to acquireand hold lands, not exceeding the prescribed number of acres except with the consent of the Minister of Health, and to execute on the lands any of the works (other than wells and works for taking or inter-intercepting water) and to exercise any of the powers mentioned in or
conferred by section 12 of the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847 (this section authorises the construction of works and buildings required for the water undertaking).     The undertakers not to create or per-mit the creation of any nuisance on the lands or erect any buildings on the lands except offices and dwellings for persons in their em-ployment and such buildings and works as may be incidental or con-nected with their undertaking.Financial^Pr owing  si ons 56.       The dividends payable by a statutory water company trad-ing for profit and the reserves they may build up are regulated normally by sections 75 to 83 of the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847, and section 122 of the Companies Clauses Act, 1845.     Briefly, these provisions are to the effect that the dividend in any one year must not exceed the rate prescribed in the Special Act or, if no such rate is prescribed, 10 per centum on the paid-up capital of the undertaking, unless a larger dividend is at any time necessary to make up the deficiency of that in any previous year.    If in any year the clear profits of the undertaking amount to a larger sum than is sufficient, after making up the deficiency of any previous year&apos;s dividend, to make a dividend at the prescribed rate, the excess is to be devoted to the formation of a reserve fund.     The limit to this fund may be prescribed in the Special Act and, if none is  prescribed   a limit of one-tenth of the nominal capital is imposed.      The fund is to be avail-able for the equalisation of dividends, and to meet any extraordinary claim or demand which may arise against the undertakers and is certified by Justices.     In addition,  section 122 of the Companies Clauses Act3 1845, applies to most statutory water companies and empowers the directors of the company before apportioning the profits to set aside such sum as they think proper, without limit, to meet contingencies, or for enlarging repairing or improving the works of the undertaking.While objection could not be taken to the accumulation of proper reserves,  the application of revenues in building them up necessarily affects the prospect of reduced charges to the consumers.
It is considered that a limit of 1 per centum of the paid-up capital of the undertakers should be placed on the total amount which they can carry in any one year to the reserve and contingency funds, and that a limit of 10 per centum of the paid-up capital should be placed on the two funds taken together.     Further, a limit should be placed on the amount which undertakers can carry forward at the end of any financial year to the credit of their net revenue account, and they should not be allowed to carry forward an amount exceeding the total of (a) the sum required.for payment of the authorised dividends and interest for that year if not already paid, (b) the amount which may lawfully be distributed in dividends on the preference and ordinary capital for the next following year, and (cJ the amount due for the next following year as interest on mortgages or debenture stock. During the last two or three years Parliament have in Special Acts frequently placed these limitations on the funds and carry forward of water undertakings and it is proposed that the provisions already endorsed by Parliament should be included in the consolidated code.Revision of Water Charges 37. Under the present code, on the petition of any twowater ratepayers within the limits of supply, the Court of Quarter-Sessions may direct an inquiry into the financial position of the undertakers, and if the Court are satisfied that the profits for the preceding year have exceeded the prescribed rate and that the maximum authorised amount of the reserve fund is invested and the full dividends authorised have been paid, the undertakers are to make such reduction in the water rates as the Court consider proper. The rate so reduced must be sufficient to ensure a profit as near as possible to that authorised by the Act.     These provisions are rarely, if ever, used.If the provisions suggested above for the limitation of the reserve and contingency funds and the carry forward are adopted a provision for the revision of water charges will not often be
required, &quot;because the water undertakers will presumably have no alternative but to reduce their water rates when the limits of these funds and carry forward are reached.    It seems desirable, however, that in any general revision of the Waterworks Clauses Acts the precautionary measure which already appears in them should be modernised, and that the Minister should be authorised, on application by a local authority having jurisdiction within the limits of supply of a water company, to make an order reducing the water rates if he is satisfied that the divisible profits for the preceding year have exceeded the amount required for payment of the authorised dividends.     The rates so reduced should remain sufficient to enable the company after all proper expenses and allocations to the two funds and carry forward have been met to continue to make the maximum dividends authorised.     The order should be open to amendment at the end of five years on the application of either the local authority or the water company.
.j Proposed additional amendments of the general lawPurchase of Company Undertakings 1.     Under section 51 of the Public Health Act, 1875, a local authority with the sanction of the Minister may purchase the waterworks of a company; and section 63 of the Act gives power to the directors of a company,  subject to certain resolutions of their members, to sell and transfer their undertaking to the local authority.      The local authority have no&quot;power, however, to purchase waterworks and supply water outside their district, and this limitation frequently leads to difficulties. It is proposed to extend the section and to provide that, where the limits of supply of a water company are not wholly within the district of a local authority, the local authority shall be empowered with the sanction of the Minister to purchase the whole of the company&apos;s undertaking, subject to the consent of the other local authorities with jurisdiction within the company1s limits,  such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, the questioi whether consent is unreasonably withheld to be determined by the Minister. The company in such cases should be entitled to sell and transfer their undertaking to any local authority within their limits.Obligation to supply 2.     Under section 35 of the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847, a water undertaker must comply with requisition for a supply of water if (l) it is made by so many owners or occupiers of houses within the area concerned that the aggregate water rates payable by them annually, at the rates specified in the Special Act, will not be less than one-tenth (now one-eighth in many Special Acts) of the initial cost of providing and laying the pipes to afford the supply, and (2) the owners and occupiers severally agree to take the supply for at least three consecutive years.      Lifficul-ties sometimes arise,  where the aggregate water rates would be sufficient to enable a requisition to be made, in obtaining the individual agree-ments, and it is proposed that in such cases a local authority shall be empowered to make the requisition on behalf of the owners and the under-takers be required to comply with the requisition if the local authority
undertake for a period of at least three years that they will make good the deficiency if the undertakers do not receive from the owners and occupiers of the houses the amount which would have been payable to them under the section, as amended by any enactments incorporating the section.3.     A still greater difficulty is where a supply to houses within the undertakers&apos; limits of supply is urgently needed, but the aggregate amount of water rates payable annually in respect of them is not sufficient to enable a requisition to be made on the undertakers to lay the necessary mains to afford a supply.     This difficulty is met to some extent in a number of Special Acts by a provision enabling a local authority to enter into agreements with undertakers for guaranteeing periodical payments to them in consideration of their extending their mains to a part of the district of the local authority in need of a supply.      It is proposed to give local authorities a general power of entering into such agreements, and further to provide -that the local authority may require the under-takers to afford a supply to any part of their district if the authority undertake to pay the deficiency until such time as the undertakers receive from the owners and occupiers of the houses in that part of the district an amount which would have enabled a requisition to be made under section 35 of the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847, as amended by an enactment incor-porating that section.4.      It is also proposed that local authorities shall be given ex-press powers of combining for the purpose of these guarantees and requisi-tions of supply.Power to compel houses to be supplied 5.      Under section 62 of the Public Health Act, 1875, where a local authority consider, on the report of their surveyor,  that any house within their district is without a proper water supply and that such a supply of water can be furnished thereto at a cost not exceeding the water rate authorised by any local Act in force within the district (or where there is not any local Act in force, at a cost not exceeding 2d a week,  or such other cost as the Minister may, on the application of the local authority, determine to be reasonable), the local authority shall give notice to the owner to obtain such supply and to do all the works necessary for the purpose.
MilIf within the specified time the notice is not complied with the local authority are empowered to do the works and for that purpose to enter into any contract with any water company who supply water within their district, and to recover their expenses from the owner.     Water rates may be levied on the premises by the authority or company which furnishes the supply and recovered as if the owner or occupier had demanded a supply and were willing to pay water rates for it.     This section enables action to be taken where the water supply to a house is inadequate and a water main is reasonably available.Provision is made in the Public Health (Water) Act, 1873, for dealing with cases of inadequate supplies to houses where there are no water mains available and a general scheme of water supply is not re-quired.     Subject, to prescribed limitations on the cost of providing a. new supply in the case of existing houses, the Act imposes a duty on every rural district council to see that every occupied dwelling house within their district has within a reasonable distance an available supply of wholesome water sufficient for the domestic purposes of the inhabitants of the house.     Section 3 of the Act provides that, if it appears to them on the report of their Inspector of Nuisances or their Medical Officer of Health that any occupied dwelling house within their district has not such a supply within a reasonable distance, and they are of opinion that such a supply can be provided at a capital cost not exceeding  3.13. 4d., or  13 if the Minister on the application of the local authority so de-termines, they may require the owner within a specified time, not exceeding 6 months,  to provide the supply and to do all the works necessary for  the purpose.     The procedure laid down as to notices is complicated.      If the owner does not provide a supply the local authority may themselves carry out the works and recover the expenses from him.     By section 4 of the Act right of appeal is given to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction or to the Minister,  according to the nature of the appeal.      The sections can be extended by Order of the Minister to any urban district council.It is proposed that these provisions of the two Acts should be simplified and made applicable to both urban and rural authorities and that the prescribed limitations on expenditure should be increased to
correspond more closely with modern prices, a limit of  20 being placed on the capital cost to be incurred by the owner, whether the necessary works are for connection to mains or for separate waterworks, such as a well.6.      It oftens happens that a separate supply under section 3 of the Act of 1878 for an individual house would exceed the prescribed limit of capital cost but that if a joint supply were afforded to two or more houses and the cost apportioned between them,  the cost to any individual house would not exceed the prescribed limit.     -Under the law as it now stands the local authority can take action to secure a joint supply only where the cost of supplying an individual house independently would be within the prescribed limit.      It is proposed to empower a local author-ity to require the owners of a number of houses in need of a supply to carry out joint works of supply where this is desirable and, in default, themselves to carry out the works and to recover the cost from the owners provided that the amount recoverable from an owner in respect of any one house does not exceed, the prescribed limit of  20.     A right of appeal to the Minister would be given, as at present, on the ground, among others, that where there is not a public supply such a supply ought to be provided by the local authority.7.     Under section 6 of the Public Health (Water) Act, 1873, it is unlawful in any rural district for the owner of any new or rebuilt dwelling house to occupy it or allow it to be  occupied unless he obtains from the local authority a certificate that a sufficient supply of whole-some water is available within a reasonable distance.     Where the certifi-cate is withheld application may be made to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction.&quot;V.The penalty under the clause is a single penalty of  10.      It is proposed that the section should be made applicable to urban as well as rural authorities and that in addition to the immediate penalty not exceeding  10 a. daily penalty not exceeding 20s. shall be imposed.8.      Section 7 of the Act of 1873 imposes on rural district  councils the duty of ascertaining from time to time the condition of the water supply within their district and confers on their officers certain powers of
entry for the purpose. It is proposed to apply this section also to urban authorities.9.     Under section 54 of the Public Health Act, 1875, a local authority may carry their water mains into, through, or under any private lands,  subject to the payment of compensation for damage, provided that on the report of their surveyor it appears to be necessary and that reasonable notice in writing has been given to the owners and occupiers. Before commencing to lay mains outside their district, six weeks&apos; notice of the work must be given, and if objections are made and not withdrawn, the sanction of the Minister is required to the work.      It is proposed to confer these powers on all statutory water undertakers, but omitting the reference to the report of the surveyor (the decision should rest with the undertakers themselves acting on the advice of their qualified officers), and also to provide that if an owner refuses to allow the undertakers to enter on land for the purpose they may obtain from a Court of Summary Jurisdiction an order authorising entry.10.    Section 29 of the Ytaterworks Clauses Act, 1847, prohibits the laying of mains in private land without the consent of the owner of the land, and water undertakers can therefore lay pipes in a private street for the supply of houses in the street only with the consent of the owner of the land in the street.    This is one of the sections applied by the Public Health Act, 1875, to local authorities.     Section 80 of the Public Health Act, 1925, however,  empowers local authorities to lay pipes in private streets (with certain exceptions) for the supply of houses in the street in the same way as if the street were a public highway, and a similar provision in the Model Water Bill (Clause 22) is commonly embodied in the Special Acts of water companies.      It is proposed to confer this power generally on statutory water undertakers.11.    Water undertakers have no general power to open up streets for the laying of mains outside their limits of supply, and difficulty some-times arises where a street is outside but houses fronting on to it are inside their limits.     To meet this difficulty, it is proposed to make of general application a provision commonly included in Special ActsLaying of Mains and Pipes
1 0 7xv&quot;authorising the undertakers to break up the street for supplying houses in such circumstances,12o     The Waterworks Clauses Acts give power to consumers to open up ground for the laying of communication pipes but, although they are made liable for maintenance; no power is given to them to open up ground for the purpose of repairing the communication pipe.     This power to be conferred on them.     A provision to this effect is common in Special Acts. Temporary discharge of water into streams13.     Water undertakers often find it necessary to run to waste water from reservoirs and other works under construction, examination or repair. There is a common provision in Special Acts, which it is proposed to make of general application, authorising them to discharge the water into any available watercourse, provided that the water is, so far as reasonably practicable,  free from mud and offensive matter, and if discharged into rivers containing fish, from other matters injurious to fish or spawn or spawning beds or food of fish.     Compensation to be payable for any damage arising from the exercise of the power.Superannuation and other allowances14.     It is proposed to authorise water companies generally (Local Authorities already have power) to grant gratuities, pensions or super-annuation allowances to any of their employees or to the widow, family or dependents of any employee, to establish funds for the purpose, and to put into force schemes prescribing the terms and conditions on which employees may become contributors to the funds,  the contributions to be made and the benefits to which the contributors will be entitled.     Pro-visions for the purpose are common in Special Acts. v.Supply of pure water15.      It is clearly desirable that all water undertakers should be required to provide pure and wholesome water, and it is proposed to insert-in the general law for uniform application to every water undertaker a provision requiring them to do so,  subject to a penalty not exceeding ten pounds and a daily penalty not exceeding forty shillings for failure to do so.
Dwelling houses for employees 16.     A common provision in Special Acts, which it is proposed to include in the general law, enables statutory water undertakers to pur-chase or take on lease and maintain houses     offices and other buildings for their employees and for the purposes of their undertaking, and to erect, maintain and let any such buildings on any lands belonging or leased to them.Copies of valuationlists17.     Water rates are usually assessed on a basis ascertainable from the current valuation lists, and it is therefore necessary for water undertakers to be in a position to obtain copies of or extracts from these lists.      It is proposed to empower them to apply to the rating authority for a copy of the current list or of any extract therefrom, the rating authority to furnish them with such copy or extract at a fee not exceeding five shillings for every hundred extracts numbered separa-tely.     This fee is prescribed by section 43(2) of the Rating and Valu-ation Act, 1925, for copies of lists or extracts supplied by rating authorities to surveyors of taxes.Levying of rates and charges18.     Section 10 of the Public Health (Water) Act, 1878, requires a borough or urban district council,    on the application of ten rate-payers in the borough or urban district, and a rural district council, on the application of five ratepayers in the contributory place (usually the parish), to charge water rates or rents on the consumers of water supplied by them.     A purely nominal charge, however, would apparently meet this requirement.    It will not be practicable, particularly in rural districts, always to levy water rates or rents of sufficient amount-,, to meet all the costs of the local authority in conducting their water undertaking, but it is considered that reasonable charges should be made, and it is proposed to require the authority to do so and to provide for appeal to the Minister by any person aggrieved by the failure of the authority to make charges or by the inadequacy of the charges.
19.     Under section 9 of the Public Health (Water)Act, 1878, a rural district council are empowered to make charges in respect of standpipe supplies on houses within two hundred feet of the standpipe. It is considered reasonable that they should be able to make similar charges in respect of public wells and cisterns provided by them.     It is also proposed that the powers should be made available to urban as well as to rural authorities; the original provision may now be put in force in any urban district by order of the Minister.Power to close polluted wells, etc.20. -   Under section 70 of the Public Health Act, 1875, where re-presentations are made to a local authority that the water in any well, tank or cistern, public or private, or supplied from any public pump, is so polluted, as to be injurious to health, and the water is used or likely to be used by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drinks for the use of man,  the authority may apply to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an.   order to remedy the defect.     It is desirable that the local authority should be able to take action under the section not only where pollution has actually occurred but where there is, a reasonable likelihood of pollution and therefore danger to health, and also where the water is used or likely to be used for manufacturing foods for the use of man, and it is proposed to amend the section accordingly.Byelaws with respect to the construction etc. of wells and rainwater tanks or cisterns21.     Under the present law a new house in a rural district mustnot be occupied until a certificate has been given by the rural districtcouncil that there is available (at the time) a sufficient supply of&quot;&apos;wholesome water, but there is no power of control over the situation,construction or equipment of private wells or over the capacity, con-struction, situation, ventilation and cleansing of tanks or cisternsfor the storage of rainwater.     These powers are desirable and it isproposed to empower local authorities to make byelaws for the purpose.
