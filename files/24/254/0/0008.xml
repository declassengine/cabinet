CONFIDENTIAL.A.C.317.BOaHiJ OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.State of Trade, ^January^^9 35^.Overseas Trade.Imports in January at  61.9 m, were  2.6 m.  less than in January, 1934.      Imports of raw materials at  19.7 m.  showed an increase over December ( 18.7 m. ) but were less than in January,19 3 ( 21.3 m. ).      Exports of United Ringdom produce and manufactures were  35.5 m. or  3.9 m. more than last January, while re-experts were  5.0 m. as compared with  4.1 law Employment.The employment position in January showed a substantial decline, mainly seasonal, as compared with a month earlier. The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges at 28th January was 2,325,373, an increase of 239,558 as compared with 17th December.      The seasonal increase was accentuated owing to a spell of unfavourable weather and by a large registration of juveniles.The main variations were: -WalesLondonNorth Eastern North Western Sco tland ....South Eastern South Western Midlands  ....4 + 4 4 4 4 4 450,192 24,071 17,412 32,451 47,875 42,096 19,700 5,761The estimated number of insuredpersons aged 16 - 64 inemployment at 28th January was 10,053,000.This was 195,000
less than at 17th December but 175,000 more than a year age, The decline in employment was most marked In the trades Which normally experience a seasonal setback in January, including the distributive trade, building and ancillary industries, road transport, dock and harbour services, hotel and boarding-house service, wool textile, hosiery,  tailoring, printing and bookbinding, and the furniture trades.      The only industry showing any marked improvement was hat and cap manufacture.Rail and Road Traffic.During the four weeks ended 27th January, railway traffic receipts increased by  13,000  (0.13/0 over the corresponding period of 1934,      Passenger traffic increased by 3.15$, but there were decreases of 2.10% in coal and other fuel and of 0,96^ in other freight traffic.Shipping.The index number for shipping freights  (1913 ^ 100) was 79,36 in January as against 80.77 in December and 81.37 twelve months ago. Banking.The surplus which usually exists at the beginning of the year was quickly absorbed.      Money became plentiful by about the middle of the month.      Partly for this reason and partly, no doubt, because the accumulation of income tax payments made possible a reduction in the amount of tender issues, the average rates for Treasury Bills fell from 6s.2d.  per cent, on the 4 h to 3s.Ild,  per cent,   (the lowest rate ever recorded) on the 25th January.      Uncertainty as to the result of the  &quot;gold clause case before the U.S. Supreme Court lead to fluctuations in the dollar rate which would have been more marked but for the steadiness of the franc, and. possibly also corrective selling by the American control.
Goal.      The average weekly output of coal for the quarter ended 26th January was 1-53 a,   tons as compared with 4.45 in.   tons in the same quarter of 1933,  an increase of 2f0.. The average number of persons employed during this period was 768,600 as against 774,200 a year before.Exports in January at 3,41 m.   tons showed an increase of 400,000 tons over January,  1934.    Increased tonnages were consigned to Scandinavian, countries, Germany,  Spain, Italy and Egypt, but exports to the Netherlands, Prance and Switzerland showed a decline.Iron and Steel.     production in January is expected to show the normal  seasonal improvement.      The steel consuming industries all report a good level of business which is expected to continue and new public works and housing schemes should mean increased activity.A satisfactory feature of the pig iron market was the increase in export orders,  though prices are still unremunerative.      The demand for finished steel from India and the Par East continues to improve,  and good orders have also been placed by Russia.      The buying of Continental semi-finished steel is quiet.In S cotland the rate of production at the end of 1934 islikely to be maintained for some time.    Ex-port enquiries are increasing and may lead to fairly substantial orders.    On theNorth East Coast condi hoas in January were favourable. Exportsof finished steel increased especially to South Africa, India,Argentina and China.      The January pig iron shipments to foreigmarkets (mainly Italy and Denmark)  were the heaviest since 1931In Sheffield thore is every prospect of a good volume ofrailway business arising soon,  and there have been good orders from Russia for tyres and axles.      Stainless steels continue in good demand.      In South Wales conditions are not as favourableas in the Autumn.      There has been a further decline in thetinplate trade,  and works are operating only  at 5Cf$ capacity asagainst an average of 60% over the whole of 1934.-3-
Machine ^ools.  In the home market the position is substantially unchanged.    Exports in January amounted to  174,000 as against  83,000 a year ago and  140,000 in January, 1933.    Of these  35,800 wore consigned to the Soviet Union as compared with  8,800 last year.Motor Industry.    The 193a models have been well received and the figures of new registrations suggest that the purchasing power of the cqimiiunity is expanding.    58,238 private cars have been newly registered in the first three months (October - December) of the 1934-5 season, an increase of 23.6;;? over the same period last year.    In the commercialvehicle section,  the improvement which set in in 1933 was well maintained during 1934 though it slackened towards the end of the year.    Both imports and exports increased in 1934, but it is estimated that the United Kingdom is still supplying only 10% of the replacement demand, in non-manufacturing countries.Light Metal Industries.    Most non-ferrous metal mills are well employed and the upward trend may shortly be resumed.. The future of copper prices is uncertain,  stocks being abnormally heaw/.    Difficulty is still being experienced in the purchase of Empire brands of lead, and zinc for prompt delivery.    The demand for the better grades of cutlery continues to improve and. the scissor and razor blade sections are well employed.    Makers of tools are finding it difficult to cope with the demand.    The press work trade  is still busyj  in the needle, foundry and metallic bedstead, trades the position remains unchanged but there  is an increased demand in the lock and allied trades,  in enamelled hollowware and in architectural metalwork.Electrical Industry.    During January 1,714 m. units of electricity were produced as compared with 1,536 m.  last year. Orders received for heavy plant were on the  same level as in previous months, but considerably higher than in January. 1954. Exports of light material  in January were  779,000 against  638,000 in January,  1934.
Cotton.    There was an appreciable improvement in January as compared with Deeemoer,    Average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to &quot;Spinners amounted    to 27.43 m.lbs. which was higher than in any month since February,   i934.    Raw cotton prices fell during the month and the margin between the prices of Indian and American cotton continued to narrow.    Spinners of Egyptian yarns maintained their margins.    Further progress has been made with the problem of surplus spinning capacity.    Negotiations for a new Wages Agreement in the weaving section are now virtually completed.Exports of cotton yarns at 13.0 m.  lbs. were slightly higher- than in the previous month and in January,  1934.    Exports of piece goods showed a more than seasonal increase being 27 m.  so.  yds higher than in December.    Among British countries there was a further improvement in trade with India and British East Africa compared both with December and with January,   1934. Exports to Ceylon and British West Indies were higher than a year ago and exports to Canada greater than in December.    Among foreign countries Scandinavia and Switzerland tooK less than a year ago,  but exports to Germany were higher than in December and in January,   19 34.    Trade with Egypt remains much oelow that of a year ago,  and exports to the Far East,  although showing an increase on December,  were less than two-thirds of those in January,   1934.Wool.    There was a decline in the general activity of the industry in January as compared with December.    There was, however,  a marked increase over December in exports of tops,-v.yarns and tissues,  exports of tops being especially large on account of shipments to Germany.    The present demand is quiet, both on home and export account,  and buyers of yarns and tissues appear reluctant to enter into speculative forward commitments. Owing,  however,  to German orders in hand for scoured wool and tops,  greater activity continues in the raw wool and combing sections.
h? 0i. tv vPaper.    The general demand for paper in the home market showed the usual seasonal decline, hut trading conditions were rather better than in January,  1934. Newsprint,  fine papers and paper hoards share in the slight improvement.      Printing papers remained at the level of a year ago, hut the demand for wrapping paper showed a definite decline.Chemicals.    Alkali deliveries in both the home and export markets showed a satisfactory increase, hut there was a seasonal slackening in orders from Scandinavia for bleaching powder and liquid chlorine.      Sales of dye staffs and intermediates showed no change.      The market for coal tar products brightened towards the end of the month,  there being important enquiries for tar acids, while tar prices for forward delivery improved.      Creosote oil was in goca demand throughout the month.      Trade was good generally in wood distillation products.Soap, Gils and Kindred Industries.    Soap prices were reduced substantially at the &quot;beginning of the month.    With the higher prices for butter the margarine trade  shows a better tone.      The demand for edible oils and fats has been heavy and prices of comuounds have arisen by 20 to 25%, owing to the advance in raw material prices.      The volume of business in raw materials in January was substantially larger than in the previous month.Retail Trade.    The value of retail sales in December was 1.8% greater than in December,  1933.      This is the smallest monthly increase in 1934 and conroares with a rise in December,  1933 of 4.1%,  the largest in that year.    It may appear from figures in recent months that the rate of expansion in sales is falling off but it must be remembered that the comparison is with the latter part of 1935 which&apos; saw
a steady improvement in trade.      Every area,   except Suburban London in the case of non-food merchandise and London (West End)   in the case of foodstuffs showed an increase.Preliminary figures for January indicate a. marked upturn in retail sales in all districts.Co-operative trade.    The Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s sales for the five weeks to ISth January,  1935, showed an increase of 8.8% as compared with the same period of last year.    The weighted average of the wholesale prices of seven of the principal commodities showed a decrease of 0.07% as compared with a year ago, and the weighted average of the retail prices of the same commodities has increased by 1.52%.EMPIRE TRADE.Canadian Trade.    The index of industrial production in December stood at 91,0 as compared with 97.0 in November. Imports of crude rubber and of raw wool showed increases, and newsprint output reached a record level.      The iron and steel and motor car industries were more active.    Imports of merchandise declined but exports were at a slightly higher level.Australian Trade.    The number of bales of wool received into store between 1st July and 31st December was 2,392,000 against 2,258,000 a year ago.      Of these,  1,104,000 were sold or exported, the  figure for the corresponding period last year being 1,478,000.      Shipments of wheat and flour since the season opened on 1st December are equivalent to 16,985,000 bushels of wheat.      Exports of butter since July 1st amount to 67,000 tons.      The total imports of merchandise in December were . 7,105,000 (Australian currency)  against  5,588,000 a year ago.Indian Trade.    Imports of merchandise into India during january,  1935,  were 12,89 lakhs as compared with 10,67 inJanuary last year.    Exports and re-exports amounted to 13,63lakhs as compared with 11,65 lakhs a year ago.-7-
