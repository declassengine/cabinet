m^JXCUMMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.SECRET. COPY NO._jCP. 64(35) .The University of Durham.&apos; Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board, of Education.1. The Royal Commission on the University of Durham which v/asappointed a year ago under the Chairmanship of Lord Moyne has now presented a unanimous report.2. The Commission was appointed on the urgent representations of the late Sir Y/alter Buchanan Riddell, Chairman of the University Grants Committee, and with, the full concurrence of the Chancellor of the University, Lord Londonderry.3. The University consists of a Senate and two teachingDivisions, one situated in Durham and the other in Newcastle.4. The Newcastle Division,  comprising the College of Medicineand Armstrong College, has &quot;been torn with dissension for the past three years owing (a) to the dismissal of a Professor of twenty-five years standing &quot;by the College of Medicine and (&quot;b)  to the decision of that College to isolate itself entirely from Armstrong College &quot;by terminating the arrangements, which had heen in existence for 40 years, whereoy instruction in the fundamental sciences (chemistry, &quot;biology, etc.) of the medical curriculum was given to medical students in the science departments of Armstrong College.5. The Durham Division consisting of a number of smallresidential colleges, though not the centre of any acute controversy,  is neither well organized nor governed in accordance with modern university practice.6. The Senate of the University has neither the statutorypower nor the money to control the constituent parts of the University and it did nothing to influence the &quot;behaviour of the
Newcastle Colleges even though the fate of a Professor of the University and the effective co-ordination of University studies were at stake.      The constitution and powers of the Senate are indeed so inadequate that though the total amount of Treasury grant to the University and its Colleges is  65,000 the University Grants Committee have never been able to advise the payment of more than  2,000 to the University as such, the remainder taking the form of direct grants to the Colleges.The Commission make drastic recommendations designed to ensure a constitution which will give the University power &quot;both to formulate and execute a considered policy and to prevent a recurrence of the undignified squabbles which have so seriously damaged its reputation.    i These recommendations are in &quot;brief ;-(a)    The croation of a small,  predominantly lay Court of the University,, to which the whole of the Treasury grant would lie paid and which,  together with a reconstituted Senate possessing the  sole power to appoint and dismiss Professors, would control the University. (d)    The amalgamation of the College  of Medicine and Armstrong College to form a single University College in Newcastle - a step contemplated in the existing statutes and long urged &quot;by many teachers in the  two Colleges as well as others,  including the Newcastle City Council, which makes substantial grants to Armstrong. College. (c)    The appointment of a permanent Head of the Durham Division, which consists of a number of small residential Colleges and has always lacked the direction necessary to ensure its proper development and co-ordination, and will need that direction still more when a single and powerful University College exists in Newcastle.The Commission recommend that Statutory Commissioners be appointed &quot;by Act of Parliament to make new statutes for the
260University in general accordance with their recommendations. This was the practice adopted in similar circumstances for the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge and London. 90 The only charge directly imposed on public funds &quot;by theBill will he a sum in respect of the expenses of the Commissioners, which is estimated not to exceed  2,000 per annum for a period which quite possibly may not extend &quot;beyond a single year.      The reconstitute ion will, however,  impose additional expenditure on the University, and as  65,000 out of a total University income of about  228,000 represents Treasury grant, the University will no doubt hope that some addition will be made to the Treasury grant when the new constitution is in being.10. On general grounds it is clearly desirable that the present state of affairs should be ended as soon as possible,  since the University cannot be expected to make normal progress while still uncertain of its future constitution.      There-a-appear-s - to be no sufficient reason for delay.      The Commission&apos;s report was unanimous.      It has been well received.      No objections have so far been raised by the College of Medicine  (the most likely objector) or from any other source.      Local members of Parliament have been sounded and have expressed themselves as desiring early legislation in accordance with the recommendations of the report. Lord Londonderry, the Chancellor of the University, has expressed to me his own approval and desire for legislation.11. All the evidence points to the desirability of legislation during the current session.      There is reason to hope that the legislation would not prove contentious and v/ould occupy no material amount of Parliamentary time.      It could be introduced in the House of Lords.12. I therefore desire authority to prepare the necessary bill and to introduce it at an early date, with a view to its passage during the coming session.H.22nd March 1935.
