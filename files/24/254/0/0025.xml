Herr Schmitt, Interpreter.FIRST MEETING. March 25, 1935, at 10-30 a.m.PRELIMINARY.SIR JOHN SIMON said that he and Mr. Eden were very glad to be in Berlin and that he himself much welcomed making Herr Hitler&apos;s acquaintance.He would first ask to make a short general statement before entering upon the discussion of the list of topics which Baron Neurath and he had agreed upon.The British Ministers gladly accepted the proposal for bi-lateral discussion made in the note from the German Government of the 14th February, and were happy to carry consultation a stage further on all the matters indicated in the London Declaration of the 3rd February. As he wished to speak frankly, he would say that there had been difficulties in undertaking the present visit as a7874   [11375] b---------------&apos;-&apos;----&quot;----&quot;*JfaPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1935.
Ifresult of the new developments in the course of the preceding 10 days. He did not desire to discuss these events, against which we had protested, but he and Mr. Eden had come in spite of them. It was an important decision to take, but they had thought it worth taking for the sake of coming into personal contact with the Head of the German Government. They were glad to note that the scope and purpose of the conversations would be as previously agreed.Sir John Simon said that he wished to present to the Chancellor on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government the view which His Majesty&apos;s Government and the British people took of the present situation, and to describe the anxiety that occupied their minds. The object of British policy was to preserve general peace by helping to secure co-operation amongst all European countries. His Majesty&apos;s Government most earnestly wished that Germany should work with all countries for that object. They felt that the future of Europe would take one of two forms. It would either take the form of general co-operation for securing continued peace and this was the form which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment earnestly desired. Or it would take the form of a division into two camps -isolation on the one side, and combination (which might look like encirclement) on the other. The message which he had to deliver on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government was that they were convinced that the future would develop in one of these two wa)^. They wished to do all in their power in co-operation with Germany in order to secure that it would be the first and not the second development which would occur. He would conclude this preliminary general statement by giving his own account of the state of British opinion.British opinion looked upon the situation as follows. People in England had been very greatly disturbed by a series of acts on the part of Germany he did not wish to discuss the question whether these acts were justified or not, but merely to report the fact. The withdrawal of Germany from Geneva, events relating to Austria, and the recent unilateral announcement connected with the rearmament now going on at a great pace in Germany, these all made it difficult for the British Ministers to fulfil their engagement to come to Berlin. The result of these events was that public opinion in England was doubtful, and was trying anxiously to estimate what was the real course of German policy. Sir John Simon thought it right to say this frankly because Great Britain was a country where the general opinion of the people was of great importance, and where the spirit and character of the people made it important for the future of Europe that their opinion should be taken into account. The British people was not anti-German; but it was very strongly opposed to any policy or to any country which was likely to disturb the peace. Germany ought to recognise that it was british influence which had operated to improve the situation in the past: he would instance reparations, the evacuation of the Rhineland, the declaration regarding equality of rights, and the arrangements for the Saar. This was evidence that the British people had tried to be fair and just. But the present situation was one in which the British people were in doubt. They were quite prepared to pay proper attention -to authoritative statements that German policy was directed towards peace. They would take Herr Hitler&apos;s word for it. What they were anxious to discover was whether there was any line of action which Germany would find it possible to take, in co-operation with other Governments, in order to persuade friendly peoples and Governments that they would be justified in abandoning their attitude of doubt and in throwing their energies into the work of co-operation with other European countries, including Germany.Sir John Simon emphasised that he had not come to Berlin to produce any cut and dried plan. . He well understood the objection to presenting such plans. They were at the stage of free and frank consultation, and the Chancellor would understand why he had thought it well to speak firmly. The British Ministers believed that the Chancellor and the German Government attached importance to British opinion, and they gladly seized the present opportunity to improve the relations between the two countries and to secure peace.HERR HITLER said he wished Sir John Simon and Mr. Eden to be assured that the German Government and people were happy to receive them. He saw in the present visit the first great possibility of reaching understanding through direct conversations, which could not be replaced by exchanges of notes or by communications through third parties. At the time of Mr. Eden&apos;s visit a year before, it had been possible to clarify a number of questions.   The present
9 o n 6 0 ivisit would give a true picture of what the German people and the German Government wanted and could do, and of what they did not want and could not do and would never do. On a historic occasion like the present, it was useless not to speak with absolute frankness.SIR JOHN SIMON agreed.HERB, HITLER continued by saying that he met the representatives of Great Britain as a man who had had no part in past events such as the outbreak, the conduct and the conclusion of the War. He would therefore approach current problems with impartiality and objectivity, and in a more unbiassed manner than probably any other European statesman could do.He emphasised in the first place that the first and only great aim of his policy was to revive and make happy a people stricken by immeasurable disaster. This was his life&apos;s work. He could solve it if he succeeded in combining the revival of the German people with the preservation of peace and the avoidance of a repetition of the disaster. The revival had three aspects, economic, political and moral.This policy was in accordance with the mandate received from the German nation, and he must have the confidence of the people, for only so could he speak with authority to foreign representatives. It was a mistake to think that there was in Germany a dictatorship which violated the will of the people. The German Government were mandatories. Like the British Government, they depended upon the will and action of the German people. It was therefore clearly impossible for him to pursue any policy which the German people did not support. His political acts during the last two years had been willed and approved by the German people, just as all his future acts would likewise be willed by the German people.Turning to Sir John Simon&apos;s observation about the two alternative courses of developments in Europe, Herr Hitler referred to the three aspects of his task. The development which the German Government and people ardently desired was along the line of solidarity and co-operation. He felt bound to point out that the experience of the past 15 years had been a bitter one. Such co-operation as the German people desired was only realisable with the disappearance of agsychosis which had been inherited from the War and was a burden upon every ind of co-operation. Such co-operation had, he might almost say, been contractually made impossible because of the absence of true equality between the parties. Any attempt to organise co-operation in conditions of inequality could not succeed and would destroy any results achieved in the past.True solidarity required that the objects of policy should not be a menace to other States, or an attempt to annul their existence. The object of German policy, in its new political conception, was not a menace to anyone. It was a pity that people abroad had not sufficiently studied the spiritual foundation of this new conception. What was often made a reproach was, in fact, a guarantee against menace from attack. National Socialism had no expansive character. National Socialism was born from the distress of the German nation and was intended to apply to the German nation alone. It was not designed for export beyond the limits of the German people. There were, indeed, a number of other conceptions abroad which were designed to conquer the minds of other peoples. This was one of the most serious threats to solidarity and co-operation in Europe. This threat was not a matter of theory only he had himself been fighting for 15 years to defend the German people against such foreign ideas. This threat was still actively in existence and all European nations were menaced by the danger of infection. This, the chief danger to European co-operation, did not come from Germany. In accordance with their own new doctrine, the German people, had no interest in pursuing an imperialist policy. Germany was surrounded by national States which were either as densely populated as Germany herself, or inhabited by intensely nationalistic peoples. To say that Germany intended to tear away territory from others was to disregard the difficulties of the economic situation from which Germany was at present suffering. His problem was to find an economic basis for the life of 60 million people. Annexation of territory would merely add to the political and economic difficulties with which he was faced. The annexation of other countries where the economic difficulties were greater than in Germany would not solve Germany &apos;s economic [11375]   &quot; B 2
problem. The German Government had not taken a single step which could be interpreted as a territorial menace to other countries.As regards the uneasiness in England to which Sir John Simon had referred, Herr Hitler said that the measures in question had been required for the achieve-ment of the Chancellor&apos;s third task, namely, moral rehabilitation and reconstruction of the German people. Economic measures had a purely internal character, except in so far as they were connected with international trade. Then again, political reconstruction, the creation of a new constitution for Germany in keeping with the tradition and character of the people, need be of no interest to the outside world. Incidentally, foreign peoples ought not to accept stories about Germany spread by self-styled political martyrs of whom the German Government were only too glad to be rid. The measures taken for moral rehabilitation, however, were not to be understood merely by references to contractual engagements, but by putting oneself in Germany&apos;s place. If England had been as unlucky as Germany since 1914, every Englishman would have acted exactly as the Chancellor had done. If importance was attached to co-operation with the German nation, and if there was an invitation to Germany to participate in more international agreements, these agreements could only have a sense and meaning if the Government which concluded them had a mandate from the German nation. It was because the German Government had a mandate for the moral rehabilitation of Germany that they could speak in Germany&apos;s name. That was the Chancellors strength. The German people Avere convinced that he would do his utmost to bring about the moral rehabilitation of Germany. If there were any doubt upon this point in Germany, that would be his destruction. This German Government and every German Government could make concessions or sacrifices for the sake of European co-operation, but there was one field in which they could make no concession, namely, where the rehabilitation of their honour was concerned.The Chancellor then turned to the acts which were regarded as disturbing by British public opinion. The decision to withdraw from the League had been approved by 94 per cent, of the German nation. He was convinced that in similar circumstances Great Britain would have done the same, and, in fact, would never have joined the League at all. The League of Nations was acceptable to Germany and would become so as soon as she could participate with absolutely equal rights. Germany did not wish to disturb European solidarity but to collaborate with equal rights.Turning to Austria, the Chancellor said that Germany did not threaten, and had never threatened, Austria. He could not, however, forget that the regime in Austria was in contradiction with the overwhelming majority of the people over which it maintained power; from this many difficulties resulted. Germany could not co-operate with a Government which, both at home and abroad, insulted the. German Government and the German ideal. \The same was true of Lithuania.. Germany did not wish for a conflict with Lithuania. But it was not to be expected that Germany could look on with equanimity while a small State oppressed 100,000 Germans whose sole misfortune was that they had been born Germans. As soon as the situation was clarified by international agreement, no one would be happier than Germany. She had no desire to interfere by violence or force.As regards armaments, Germany had been accused of violating the Treaty.-If he had been Chancellor in 1919, he would never. have signed the Treaty of &quot;Versailles. He would rather have died. A weak Government and a disheartened people had been forced to accept it under pressure. Germany would respect the territorial clauses of the Treaty, however terrible they might be for Germany. But as regards moral defamation, that they would never accept. Those parts of the Treaty which defamed Germany were themselves immoral. He had never concealed his view on this point,&apos; and had always promised that he Would liberate the German people from these clauses. He recalled that on an earlier occasion Germany had had to violate a treaty. In 1806, Napoleon had imposed a treaty on Germany. But on the evening of Waterloo, Wellington did not protest when the Prussian army arrived, although that army could only arrive in violation of a treaty.The Chancellor emphasised that Germany had no interest in sabotaging co-operation between other nations. He saw it stated in the press that Germany intended to separate Great Britain from France, and that this was why the British
Ministers had been invited to come to Berlin. He would recall that he had invited Trance five times to take part in separate talks. He had made a solemn -declaration after the Saar plebiscite that there were no further territorial differences dividing the two countries. France had not done anything of this kind after 1870. Nevertheless, France had merely noted, and had sent no reply. On the contrary, French Ministers preferred to go to Moscow. He had invited Sir John :Simon and Mr. Eden in order to establish direct contact; he had no desire to disturb European co-operation. He was glad that the British Ministers had come and that they had come as &quot; loyal and honest brokers,&quot; as an English newspaper had put it. He asked them to understand what were the feelings of a country which, in a situation of isolation, had suffered unprecedented humiliation for twenty years. He was prepared to make concessions, except where honour was concerned. If he made concessions on this latter point, he would no longer be Chancellor, and he was not sure whether this would be a help to European pacification.SIR JOHN SIMON thanked the Chancellor for his full and clear exposition. He was convinced from the experience of that morning that the Chancellor was right when he said that direct contacts were capable of doing more than exchanges of despatches. There Avas only one point on which the Chancellor appeared to be under some misapprehension. He had spoken more than once as if the British people were unable to understand the motives which had led to the determined efforts on the part of Germany to rehabilitate herself in the moral sphere and in other spheres. He would say most definitely that if the Chancellor thought this, be was quite wrong. The British people understood quite well, and it was because they did understand, that they were anxious to see whether they could find some basis of co-operation with Germany on a footing of real equality. It was not past events which determined the situation, but the decision which might be reached at present in collaboration with Germany and other States for the imme--diate future. The British people harboured no resentment. They were a practical people with generous instincts, and that was why they wished to use the present opportunity to the full. He was grateful to the Chancellor for his reference to the absurd idea that the invitation was an attempt to separate France from Great Britain. This would be exactly contrary to the British con--ception of European co-operation. Faithful to this conception, His Majesty&apos;s Government thought it essential to devote themselves to the tasks of the immediate future, in collaboration with France and other nations.Sir John Simon asked whether they might now turn to the separate questions for discussion.HERR HITLER agreed.EASTERN PACT.SIR JOFIN SIMON said that in these circumstances he would explain the ^British Government^ position with regard to the Eastern Pact.When the Eastern Pact was first proposed last summer, the British Govern-ment made it clear that they had several criticisms to make. Their interest in the proposed pact was due to the fact that they did not see how European peace and solidarity were to be assured unless in the East of Europe there was some additional contribution to security by means of the co-operation of the Powers in that region. v.In Western Europe there was Locarno, and the British Government were glad to know that the obligations and rights of Locarno were recognised and affirmed in their fullest sense by the Chancellor and by the German Government. In Western Europe then there was that element of solidarity.As regards an Eastern arrangement, it seemed to Sir John Simon that there were three elements to be considered : (1) A Covenant of non-aggression between the Powers participating in the Eastern Pact;(2) Provision for consultation between those Powers if any one of them thought that the Covenant of non-aggression was in danger of being disregarded;(3) Provisions for mutual assistance.
The position of the British Government was as follows : They believed that they were contributing to the solidarity of Europe in making their criticisms of the original proposals; and its outline was to some extent modified to meet their criticisms. They had formed and expressed the view that they would like to see such a pact concluded; and the British Ministers present in Berlin that day would be glad to learn from the Chancellor how Germany regarded the suggested pact under the three heads of- (1) Non-aggression;(2) Consultation;(3) Mutual assistance.HERR HITLER said that he had already declared that, according to all the possibilities of human anticipation, the German Government had nothing to expect from warlike developments. He himself and the German military experts considered that a new European war must have terrible repercussions. From the military point of view it was now necessary to take account of air forces; and from that point of view Germany was more threatened than certain countries on the Eastern confines of Europe. Those countries with large open spaces were not as vulnerable as Germany with her densely populated industrial areas. Germany was 95 per cent, more vulnerable than those countries. There-fore Germany was the country most interested in the preservation of peace.The object of the Eastern Pact was to secure peace or, in other words, to prevent war.Here the question arose as to the possible parties to any war in Eastern Europe.   Such a war, for example, might be between Germany and Poland; Russia and Germany; Russia and the Baltic States; Poland and the Baltic States; Germany and the Baltic States; Poland and Czechoslovakia; Germany and Czechoslovakia.As regards the practical probability of war between any of these groups of Powers, Herr Hitler wished to observe that Germany and Russia had no common frontier and therefore there would be no war; there would be no war between Germany and Poland because of the non-aggression pact between the two Powers; again, Russia and Poland had a non-aggression pact which was still good for eight or nine years; war between the Baltic States and Russia could, Herr Hitler-thought, be excluded because there were to a large degree non-aggression pacts; war between Germany and Czechoslovakia could be excluded because there was an arbitration agreement.Therefore the real possibilities of conflict in those regions of Europe were limited.But there was another question as to which Powers might declare war on other Powers in those regions. It was impossible to suppose that the Baltic States would declare war on Russia, or that Poland would declare war on Russia.Further, Herr Hitler could give the British Ministers the assurance that: Germany would never declare war on Russia.He had not the same conviction as regards Russia. He thought that there was an aggressive tendency in Russia to-day. The Bolshevist theory and the aims of the Soviet Government were identical. He had many press extracts which confirmed this impression. He did not believe that the old mentality of the bolshevism of fifteen years ago had changed. Further, the Russian population had a certain hostile tendency against Poland. Therefore political tendencies and the national objective seemed in the case of Russia to complete one another.It might seem that the Russian anxiety for the Eastern Pact contradicted this assumption. But Herr Hitler thought that Russia&apos;s desire in this matter was to have a freer hand in the Far East; and he thought that after the situation in the Far East had been liquidated Russia would show less anxiety to have an Eastern Pact.
They were discussing very frankly that day and therefore he was giving a frank opinion. It was not a question of whether or not he was right; but he wanted the British Ministers to know what his ideas were.Herr Hitler repeated that because of the combination of Bolshevist doctrines with the political aims of Eussia and because of the strength of the Russian military and economic organisation, it seemed to him that from Russia there was greater probability of war than from other countries.Moreover, the risks for Russia in a possible war were smaller than those for other Powers. Russia could with impunity allow the occupation of great tracts of her territory as large as Germany; she could permit bombardment of great regions; she could therefore wage war without risking destruction.The German Government were convinced that security in Eastern Europe would be increased by the conclusion of non-aggression pacts; and they had taken the initiative vis-a-vis Poland; they would extend these non-aggression pacts to other Powers with the exception of Lithuania.But Herr Hitler wished to be clear why he refused a non-aggression pact to Lithuania. His refusal did not mean that he wanted war with Lithuania; but that he could not conclude a non-aggression pact with a Power who treated her German minority as Lithuania did. If the guarantor Powers would bring Lithuania back to a legal basis, then the obstacle from the German side to the conclusion of a non-aggression pact with Lithuania would have disappeared.Herr Hitler desired to assure the British Ministers that he did not want war with Lithuania; and that he would not risk war with her on behalf of the comparatively few Germans in Memel. But he would not give Lithuania a non-aggression pact unless she respected her obligations. If Great Britain and the other Powers wanted a non-aggression pact for Lithuania, then they must make her observe her obligations.Mr. EDEN said that the Chancellor had spoken of the menace of Bolshevism. It seemed to the British Ministers that the menace of communism was an internal rather than an international problem. No doubt the Communist leaders would like other countries to adopt their creed; but it was improbable that they would go to war for that.The country which had most to do at home was Russia, who had great territories to develop. Further, he would not have thought that a nation could win a v/ar by the air weapon alone; and he would not have thought that Russia was a military menace for many years. But if there was such a danger, was it not exactly such an arrangement as that which they had in mind for strengthening the solidarity of Europe which could best meet it ?The British Ministers fully accepted the Chancellors assurance respecting Germany&apos;s attitude to Russia. He was sure that the Chancellor would not mind his mentioning the fact that one element in the fear of Russia for Germany was what was known as &quot;Herr Rosenberg&apos;s plan.&quot; That plan was one of the elements in Russia&apos;s fear of Germany. (At this point the Chancellor and Baron von Neurath smiled.)The interest of Britain in this matter was to secure a European Eastern settlement as useful as Locarno had proved to be. The British Ministers did not know enough to enter into the details of such an arrangement; but they were -confident that there could be no general settlement without it.Mr. Eden wished to ask the Chancellor one further question. Would he be willing to include his bilateral pacts in a multilateral settlement \HERR HITLER said that, when he had referred to the Russian menace, he had not meant to suggest that European co-operation and solidarity were unnecessary. He was firmly convinced that one day that co-operation and solidarity would be urgently necessary to defend Europe against the Asiatic and Bolshevik menace. He thought that Russia saw in Germany the champion of Europe against that menace, as Germany saw in Poland the bulwark against that menace.If he was wrong, Europe would be all the happier; but if he was right, it was necessary to take account of the possibility.He agreed with Mr. Eden that the air arm could not decide a war, certainly not a war against Russia; though an air attack might be much more serious for Germany, England or France.
As to the value of Russian land armaments, he thought they had a great value and that they were very important. Fifteen years ago Russia had had no army. Ten years ago she had begun to reconstruct; and five years ago she had a considerable army. To-day she had a very strong army; in five years she would be still stronger; and in ten years she might have 20,000 to 30,000 military aeroplanes and 20,000 tanks and 16 to 18 million men under arms.Her war industry was very favourably situated. It was safe from bombing attack*aiid invasion; and this conviction was shared by the German military experts. Whatever might be said about German military officers, at least they knew their business. In ten years&apos; time, then, Russia would be a very formidable Power.Mr. Eden had asked him if he would include his bilateral pacts in a multi-lateral system. The German Government had no objection except as regards Lithuania, with whom a pact would only be possible when she respected her legal obligations.SIR JOHN&quot; SIMON enquired as regards Lithuania and Memel whether he rightly understood that, when Herr Hitler said he would be prepared to include his bilateral pacts in a multilateral arrangement, but made an exception in the case of Lithuania, that was not an exception of principle but because of the difficulties, about Memel.Was the Chancellor willing, in principle, to include Lithuania in a bilateral pact ? If that was so, it would be most useful to the British Government to know it because of any efforts which they might make to secure that Lithuania returned to the proper regard of her.obligations.HERR HITLER replied in the affirmative.He turned to the point of consultation; and said that the German Govern-ment were ready to accept consultation as part of an Eastern Pact if difficulties arose.As regards the third point, that of mutual assistance, that was the centre of the difficulty. The practical realisation of mutual assistance depended upon which Power was considered to be the aggressor.It would take about 20 years to define the aggressor. In the last war people in England were firmly convinced that Germany was the aggressor; and in Germany people were equally convinced that France and Russia were the aggressors.There would never be agreement on points of that kind. Many honourable Germans would swear that in their deepest conviction Germany had no respon-sibility for the outbreak of war; and as many honourable Englishmen and Frenchmen would swear in the opposite sense. Therefore it was impossible to agree on that point. Where could they find the wisdom of a Solomon who could reach in a moment a decision on the question of the definition of the aggressor.The German object was to avoid war. Herr Hitler feared that the only result of mutual assistance would be better to organise war.Herr Hitler considered that mutual assistance was nothing else but what there had been in the pre-war treaties. What were the Entente Cordiale and the Triple Alliance but defensive agreements to defend the parties against an aggressor; but they had launched the world into a terrible war. Mutual assistance would merely serve to organise war. It gave the appearance of respectability to those who wanted allies.SIR JOHN SIMON said that there was a difference between the philosophy of mutual assistance and the old pre-war system exemplified by the Entente or the Triple Alliance.Herr Hitler might be right in his criticisms of the new system; but it was certainly not the old pre-war system. The difference Was that under the old system three Powers agreed to operate together against external attack. The essence of the new system was not a combination of numbers to stand against external danger; but the agreement of the Powers concerned to restrain the wrongful act of one of their number.That was the essence of Locarno and that was why the British Government thought Locarno useful. Herr Hitler might be right if he objected to both systems; but the two systems were not the same.
HERR HITLER accepted this criticism, but said that it must not be forgotten that the conclusion of pacts of mutual assistance did not remove the divergence of interest between the parties. Under cover of these pacts the differences might go on.During the last fifteen years a certain practice had established itself, under which, when two countries quarrelled and there was a great difference in their strength, it was the general custom to take the side of the stronger and to help the stronger, and to make the weaker give way. That was done to preserve peace and avoid war. But that practice (which was followed even by the League of Nations) resulted from the fact that the stronger Power had the opportunity of attacking the weaker, but that all the same it got the help of the other Powers-The question of the definition of the aggressor was one of the utmost importance. It was indispensable that it should be possible to define the aggressor beyond all doubt; for under the proposed mutual assistance he himself might have to lead the German people to war if other Powers were quarrelling.Under the proposed system he would have to undertake to lead millions of Germans ,to war; and he would not know which of the Powers was right and which was wrong. In the East there would be a great difference between the proposed system and Locarno, which was limited to a few countries whose main difficulties were known.   Those countries lived together with common frontiers.It would be very difficult in the East, where there were many countries with complicated situations. They were faced in the East with an agglomeration of countries with problems which were difficult to understand; and there was, more-over, a constant change of the governing personnel. There were, in fact, possi-bilities of conflicts the causes of which it would be hard to fathom.Moreover, the participants in Locarno had a greater sense of their responsibilities and realised more clearly what was at stake.It would be very difficult for him to lead the German people to bloodshed and war when he was not clear about the problems at stake or what Germany would be fighting for.He could do this all the less because he had solemnly given up Alsace-Lorraine; it must be remembered that Alsace-Lorraine had originally been German, and that it had been retaken by Germany after a terrible war and then lost by Germany after another even more terrible war.Now he had given up his claim to Alsace-Lorraine for the sake of peace; but, having done that, how could he bring the German people into a new war and impose upon them all the sacrifices which would be involved when the questions at issue would be quite foreign to Germany?He did not know if an English statesman would lead his country to war for problems which had nothing to do with England.If a German statesman signed an Eastern Pact including a mutual assistance system, he would be exceeding the mandate given him by the German nation. Then, if serious circumstances arose, such a treaty would be valueless. Eor if he signed anything he wanted to be sure he could keep to it and stick to it. He could not undertake to lead Germany to war for problems of the kind which would be involved under a mutual assistance system in the East.What else was involved in this mutual assistance system ? It was thought that, in certain circumstances, Germany would receive help from Russia against France, or help from France against Russia. But he must make it clear that nobody in Germany wanted to be protected by Russia. They were more afraid of Russian protection than of a French attack.If they were to receive an assurance of assistance from Britain, that would be welcome, and British troops on German soil would be very welcome, but certainly not Bolshevist troops. He said that as one who had seen Bolshevism in Germany.If he called in the Bolshevists to protect Germany, that would be like opening a box of pestilence germs at the front. The object would be to kill the enemy, but the germs would destroy one&apos;s own troops as well.Therefore Germany did not want Russia&apos;s protection.Further, he could not tell a National Socialist to fight for Bolshevism. That would be like inviting the Pope or the Catholic Church to send their monks to help Buddhism or Mohammedanism.Some things were impossible, and to invite National Socialists to fight for Bolshevists was impossible.[11375] c
(The meeting then adjourned.)He could not sign such an agreement. National Socialists Could not fight for the Bolshevists; and he thought the British Goverilhlent would understand that.But he might be prepared to take negative measures and to say that ho party to the proposed pact should give assistance to an aggressor.
.-; -----     -&apos; &apos;   SECOND MEETING,March 25, 1935, at 4 p.m.EASTERN PACT (continued).SIR JOHN SIMON said that he would raise one question about the Eastern Pact which he had not put during the morning meeting. He quite understood Herr Hitler&apos;s contemplated multilateral pact of non-aggression and consultation,, and Herr Hitler had explained why Germany could not favour being a party to a. pact of mutual assistance in the East. But supposing it were possible to frame a. multilateral pact of non-aggression and consultation, might it not be that some pf the other parties to the multilateral pact might wish to enter into agreements, pf mutual assistance as between themselves, Germany not herself offering to assist? This was a possible development. While His Majesty&apos;s Government were not, of course, directly concerned, the British Ministers thought that it would be useful to obtain some information. What would the German view be if such a situation presented itself ?HERR HITLER thought that the idea was dangerous and objectionable. If within the Eastern Pact a group were to conclude a separate agreement of mutual assistance, this would be an exact copy of the pre-war system. It would not be a general system, but special group interests within the wider system. There would be two groups within the general arrangement, namely, those who were parties only to obligations of non-aggression and consultation, and those who were parties to obligations of mutual assistance. It was unlikely that if a conflict were to arise between a member of the first group and a member of the second group, an impartial decision could be reached. The decision would probably be in accordance with the weight behind the two several groups. The parties to the obligations of mutual assistance could not be expected to take an impartial decision, but would be bound by their special obligations. This would be an exact reproduction of the military alliances before the war. Although they were called defensive, they involved an extension of the conflagration, with the result that there was a world-wide conflict, out of all proportion to the point of departure. It was necessary to localise conflicts and prevent them from spreading, and to* give members of consultative pacts time during which to consult.There was a further possible consequence. There might be within a single larger framework, two separate groups bound by obligations of mutual assistance. There might, for example, be a group comprising France, Russia and Czechoslovakia, and another group comprising Germany, Poland and other States. This would split the general Eastern Pact into a number of groups, contrary to the spirit of the Covenant, and these groups would draw their moral sanction Only from the fact of their inclusion within the framework of the Eastern Pact.The German Government thought the best course would be to conclude a general pact containing obligations of non-aggression and consultation, and an undertaking not to afford. assistance to an aggressor. This would be sufficient if the parties had confidence in the signatures to the pact.Herr Hitler thought it necessary to say that there were no military agree-ments, open or secret, between Germany and Poland. Neither the German Government nor, he believed, the Polish Government, had any desire for such agreements.SIR JOHN SIMON said he understood from Baron von Neurath that it was intended to communicate to His Majesty&apos;s Government more detailed proposals of. the German Government in reference to an Eastern Pact. He understood that Baron von Neurath would state the German proposal in greater detail later in order to save the Chancellors time.He had also been informed that the French Government had asked the German Government for their views on the proposed Eastern Pact, but that the German Government had not yet replied. He of course disclaimed any desire to play any more active part in this than was fitting, but he took the liberty to hope that the German Government would reply to the French Government at an early date.[11375] c 2
BARON von NEURATH recalled that the French Government had sent a rejoinder to the first German reply to the proposal for ah Eastern Pact.: This French Communication contained nothing to justify any change in the German attitude. The German Government were ready to reply to the French Govern-ment if the latter so wished. The reply would be on the lines just stated by the Chancellor. In no circumstances would the German Government accept provisions of mutual assistance, but they were quite willing to accept the other aspects of the proposal. There was another point which had not been mentioned by the Chancellor, namely, that the German Government was also ready to accept arbitration as already in force between Germany and other countries.. As regards the question put by Sir John Simon at the opening of the meeting,, he remarked that Germany would, of course, be in the group which did not afford mutual assistance. The proposal would be tantamount to legalising alliances. Agreements of mutual assistance were, in fact, military alliances. If Germany -entered the pact in such circumstances, she would be merely giving her sanction to a Franco-Russian alliance. The situation would, in fact, be the same as if there were no pact at all and the same two countries had concluded an alliance.SIR JOHN SIMON made it clear that he was not recommending any course of action about the French note, but merely asking for information. It was not. of course, for him to say, but he wrould have thought that the despatch of a German reply to the French Government would clarify the situation, whatever that reply might be.HERR HITLER interposed to say that a conversation like the present, clarified the situation more than fifty diplomatic notes.SIR JOHN SIMON observed that there was, however, no French representative present.AUSTRIA.SIR JOHN SIMON then suggested that the subject of Austria might be dealt with and he would ask Mr. Eden to begin.Mr. EDEN.said that the German Government were apparently not satisfied with the latest reply received from the French Government. He believed that the German Government favoured the Central European Pact in principle, but that they found difficulties in practice. The only feeling of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter was that it would be a good thing if these practical difficulties could be surmounted, and the sooner the better.HERR HITLER said he wished to offer some observations on the general aspects of the Austrian problem. The inhabitants of the two countries had the same national origin, and until 1866 both countries formed a single political unit, although they were under different sovereignties. He had no doubt that if a free vote were possible, the population of Austria would vote for closer relations, if not complete union, with Germany. Germany and&apos; Austria had always had -certain ideas in common, in literature, poetry, music, arts and sciences, in legal -conceptions and historical traditions. They also had common political ideas. Socialism had prevailed in both Germany and Austria, as also had liberalism and communism and now National-Socialism. A further element was that of very close personal relationships. Hundreds of thousands of Austrians had relatives in Germany and vice versa. There was a very strong German colony in Austria and over 275,000 Austrians were living in Germany, with relations in Austria. The Chancellor himself was Austrian born, and most of his relations lived in Austria. This was a decisive element for the comprehension of the relations existing between the two countries. The difficulties arising out of the separation of two members of one and the same unit were increased by economic difficulties. A very great many Austrians were convinced that economically Austria could not live alone. He would assert, however, that no one in Germany had any thought of annexing Austria, or of depriving her of her right of self-determination, or of imposing upon Austria any union with Germany. The present difficulties between the two countries had arisen from the fact that in Germany National-Socialism had conquered the nation, while in Austria a
similar organisation.had been successful, but had then been met by:a counter-organisation financed. by - Italian Fascism. This was an. internal Austrian, conflict. The present regime had declared itself a sovereign and permanent instrument of government and had suppressed all organs of expression of the people&apos;s will. This had driven more than 40,000 Austrians to emigrate to Germany. Another 100,000 addressed themselves to relations in Germany. The Austrian emigrants in Germany were more numerous than the German emigrants in England, France or the Netherlands. The important fact was that a large number of Austrian emigrants in Germany had relations in Austria. This was where the problem of interference arose. He would point out that a large amount of literature was published in Paris, Warsaw, Prague and London severely attacking the German Government, advocating its overthrow, and inciting to disobedience, although 96 per cent, of the German people were in favour of the National-Socialist regime. Attacks were even made upon the legal institutions of Germany, such, for example, as during the Reichstag fire trial held in London. Millions of leaflets and hundreds of thousands of pamphlets were printed abroad, and Governments declared that they were unable to stop this at the very moment when the same Governments reproached the German Govern-ment with its inability to put a stop to similar action by Austrian emigres in Germany. If the regime in Austria was supported by the Austrian people, the emigres would have no moral foundation for their activities, just as the German emigres had no moral foundation for theirs.Not for one minute did Germany think of violating Austrian territory or disregarding the treaty or imposing any regime upon Austria. He would assure the British Ministers, as one who knew Austria, that he had no desire to increase the economic difficulties of his own country by the annexation of a country whose economic difficulties were greater still. He would be glad if Austria could disappear from the chess-board of European politics. Germans would like to leave Austria severely alone, but of course other countries would also have to do the same. He was here of course not referring to England, but to another country which looked on Austria as a field for political influence and as a basis for future hopes. Germany was ready to do her utmost to contribute towards the appeasement of the Austrian situation.BARON von NEURATH observed that Germany accepted the idea of a Central European pact in principle, but raised doubts as its practicability. One difficulty was the definition of non-interference. The reply received by Germany to the question on this point was obscure. The difficulty of finding a definition was illustrated by the following incidents. A fortnight ago he had received a protest from the Austrian Government in regard to a remark made in private conversation by the Chancellor at Saarbrucken to the effect-ithat if there were a vote in Austria the result might be the same as in the Saar. The Austrian Government thought this was interference.Then, again, Sir John Simon had said in the House of Commons that the Austrian Ministers when in London had understood the lively interest taken by the British public in the Marxist riots in Austria. In view of this difficulty of definition, the German Government thought they could now await further proposals from those who had initiated the proposal for the pact.SIR JOHN SIMON remarked that he had said nothing about riots.BARON von NEURATH tried to repeat what Sir John Simon had said, but had to confess that he could not remember the precise words.        &quot; vSIR JOHN SIMON suggested that he might look- it up.HERR HITLER said that he would be glad if a good definition of the notion of non-interference could be accepted. , He could easily bring into the room several hundred Communist criminals sent into Germany from Russia, who had received training in the handling of explosives and in making bomb attacks. -There were 400 or 500 of.them in German prisons. This showed how elastic nqn-interference could be. The country which was sending these people into Germany wanted Germany to enter into a pact of non-interference. When the Communist centre of Berlin was seized, they had. found military maps prepared by General Staff officers in preparation for civil war in Germany. These had come from Russia, as well as money.   This.was a striking example in non-interference.
HERR von RIBBENTROP remarked that there were also leaflets in English and in Indian languages.HERR HITLER added that there were special sections of the Comintern for England, India, Poland, Spain and United States of America.Mr. EDEN said that he quite admitted the existence of these terrorist organisations. The problem had recently been raised in an acute form by the murder of King Alexander. A committee had been set up by the Council of the League to see what could be done about it. The problem was not necessarily insoluble. It would be a pity if, on this ground alone, the Central European pact were to be abandoned.HERR HITLER-said he had raised these points merely in order to show how difficult it was to define non-interference.&apos;Mr. EDEN recalled that the point at issue was the French reply to the German Government, but he saw no reason why this particular difficulty should hold up the whole scheme.SIR JOHN SIMON said that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad if the German Government would favour the idea of a general pact, the object of which would be to exclude external non-interference from Austria; but he recognised the difficulty of definition. Perhaps the German Government would contribute by suggesting a new draft. He did not want to set Baron von Neuratb an insoluble problem, but he would be glad if he would try.HERR HITLER remarked that they would leave the initiative to those who had first taken it. The German Government had never threatened the sovereignty of Austria nor had they any intention of attacking Austria. Germany might have mobilised two or three divisions in 1934, and Germany would to-day be in a position to do so if she desired to exercise pressure. Germany had not mobilised and would not do so. She did not seek diplomatic success through military pressure. If it came to the worst German soldiers would do their duty as bravely as those of the country which had thought it necessary to mobilise and to call up young men to the colours.   Austrian sovereignty was not threatened by Germany.HERR von RIBBENTROP recalled that the Chancellor had said that he had.no desire to intervene in Austrian affairs and would welcome a solution of the Austrian problem to the satisfaction of all concerned, so that it might cease to be the object of international quarrels. The British Government had of course given serious consideration to this problem. Could Sir John Simon say what their ideas were ?-SIR JOHN SIMON said that he had stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government would like to see such a policy pursued as would ensure the integrity and independence of Austria. But His Majesty&apos;s Government could not treat Austria in the same way as a country like Belgium which lay at their doors. His-Majesty&apos;s. Governments only desire was to see that part of Europe settle down. In their view interference by one side was as objectionable as interference by the other.HERR HITLER said that that was an idea which he could perfectly well, accept.SIR JOHN SIMON said that it only needed working out. Was it possible to make any progress in practice at the present moment ?HERR HITLER said he was convinced that the moment they reached a practical solution, the elements now obscuring the situation would be eliminated ry the solution which had been found. The draft agreement in its present form lad met with objection:from others besides the German Government. , ..&apos; SIR JOHN SIMON said that he did not like to finish a discussipn&apos;so long &quot;as there was something not clear in his mind. The C.hajioeUp?&apos;..&apos;![ia4&apos;&apos;,;:g!9id: that as soon as a practical solution had been reached all difficulties would disappear. Ills colleagues might ask him what the Chancellor had meahfc by a &quot; practical solution.&quot; Was there anything Herr Hitler could say to make clear his idea of such a solution? &apos; -&apos;- - ^        - .
HERE HITLER said that the solution he had in mind wouldbe a solution acceptable to. all other countries. The scheme at present in contemplation was hot acceptable to most of the countries concerned, in fact only to Italy and. France, that is to say to countries either indirectly interested or only unilaterally interested. What he had in mind was something satisfactory to all countries concerned. He did not like others to prepare a meal which none of them really liked, but which they called upon Germany to taste first, the result being that they could plead that they could not be expected to taste it because Germany refused to do so. It would be better for the other parties to draw up something which they all liked, and then the German Government would probably come in.SIR ERIC PHIPPS pointedly remarked that this was contrary &apos;to the -common German thesis. The usual German complaint was that other people presented her with a dish already cooked, whereas she claimed the right to take part in the cooking.HERE HITLER said there was a great difference between the Austrian question and the questions to which Sir Eric Phipps had drawn attention.The Austrian problem did not interest the German Government or concern them. The other questions in regard to which the German Government had com-plained of not being consulted from the outset were questions of vital interest to Germany.Germany did not intend to threaten the independence of Austria. There-fore there was no reason why the German Government should say anything with regard to Austria. The German Government thought that the question of Austria had been artificially created. Therefore they would make no sacrifice, because Germany had no intention of attacking Austria. The question of arma-ments was entirely different, for in that the German Government were vitally interested.In the Austrian question the German Government were not interested. They wanted, of course, to be agreeable to other Powers in regard thereto and to make a contribution to the settlement of the question. But they did not think the Austrian question a problem at all. Why should they guarantee non-interference with Austria when such a guarantee was not deemed necessary in the case of other countries 1 Germany, for example, was bothered by the question of the emigres, but nobody wanted to guarantee her.The German Government were indifferent to the Austrian question, which did not necessitate sacrifice or concessions by them.Why could not the question be settled by a non-aggression pact? The German Government feared by the suggestions which were put to them to com-plicate a troubled situation. They preferred clear-cut solutions, a non-aggression pact, for example.They did not see the utility of a guarantee of non-interference.. They need make no sacrifices in the Austrian question because Germany did not intend to threaten the independence of Austria.Herr Hitler was not so foolish as to think that he could localise the question of the union of Germany and Austria. Of course, an attempt at union would have wide repercussions, Germany did not see why special safeguards, were necessary, for she did not intend to threaten Austrian independence.THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. vSIR JOHN SIMON said that he did not feel able to say any more on the Austrian question, but there were still three matters for discussion. He would like to hear the German Government&apos;s views on the League of Nations. He would like to say something about armaments, and he would like to communicate nis ideas about the Air Pact and to hear Herr Hitler&apos;s views on that question.HERR HITLER-suggested that the question of the League of Nations should be taken immediately, and the other questions on the following day. -SIR JOHN SIMON : As regards the League of Nations, Herr Hitler must know how sincerely the British Government was attached to this new Conception of a League of Nations.     It provided an essential meeting-place where the
discussion of difficulties might take place and where it had been possible to reach adjustments about many matters which might otherwise have become dangerous.Even recently, the value of the League had been made manifest in the question of the policing of the Saar. There, it was true, the British Government had taken the initiative, but the other national contingents could not have been so easily secured or general agreement reached without the useful machinery of the League. Sir John Simon wished to acknowledge the Chancellors prompt reply about the British proposal for the international force for the Saar.Another recent instance of the great value of the League was in the matter of the difficulties between Yugoslavia and Hungary.The British Government knew that the German Government felt that they had criticisms to make on the League of Nations, and he had heard that the German Government thought that the League Covenant should be modified.In England they were deeply attached to the League, ahd they did not wish to see it used on behalf of one side or the other. That was one reason why they attached such importance to the German return to the League, for in the present circumstances they had not the same contact with Germany as they had with the-Powers at Geneva.Sir John Simon explained that the British Ministers wished particularly to mention the League on this occasion because the German return to the League was a great pre-occupation to the average British citizen, who wanted to do what was fair and right, and who wanted to facilitate Germany&apos;s return to the League.That feeling was very widespread in Britain, and it was a feeling of regret to very many British people that Germany was not at Geneva. In these circum-stances anything Herr Hitler could tell the British Ministers on this matter would be very helpful to them because they wanted to be &quot; honest brokers,&quot; as Herr Hitler himself had said a little earlier in the meeting.HERR HITLER said that the League of Nations was the most difficult Of the matters they had to discuss, because Germany, in the belief she had in the League of Nations in 1918, had laid down her arms. The League had been one of President Wilson&apos;s 14 Points, &quot; a society of free nations where there should be no victors and no vanquished, and which should unite all the nations to prevent the recurrence of war.&quot;Although all the nations had suffered from the war, none had suffered like Germany with her 2 million dead in battle and 800,000 who had died from starvation. In Germany opinion had at the end of the war been more favourable than in any other country to the League because German opinion thought that the League would be a way to solve all these problems.Then came a great disillusionment owing to the coupling of the Covenant with the Treaty of Versailles, German opinion had realised that the League, in which it had placed such high hopes, was the only organ by which the Treaty was to be executed. That Treaty had classified the nations as victors and vanquished, as the superior and the inferior.Certain German Governments had accepted that classification; but the German people had never accepted it.In the war the German soldiers had never had any feeling of inferiority; and they who had come in their millions to fight had taken no previous part in public affairs, and therefore could not be made responsible for the war.He himself had only been 25 in 1914; and he had not been responsible for the war; but he had done his duty to his country.The German soldiers had had no feeling of inferiority to others. They -had had, indeed, admiration for the soldiers of their enemies and, particularly, for the British soldiers. They might have lost the war; but they felt no moral inferiority. &apos;If Herr Hitler had been Chancellor in 1914 there would have been no war,, and certainly not a Avar with England; and if he had been Chancellor the war, had it taken place, would not necessarily have been lost. -The Treaty of Versailles had imposed upon the German nation an inferiority which they had never recognised. The imposition of that inferiority was the greatest mistake in the Treaty. It was hot the territorial changes imposed by the Treaty or the reparations; but it was the inferiority which rankled, the division, into two classes Of nations.
Once the League of Nations had associated itself with that system, it was impossible for any honest and truth-loving German to associate himself With the League. If Britain wanted relations with Germany, she must want them with the good and honest Germans and not with the bad Germans; the good Germans would not have accepted the idea of inferiority. If those good Germans were to agree and shake hands with the British, the latter must take the hands of the good Germans as the Germans would wish to take the hands of the good English.Mr. EDEN wished to emphasise once more what Sir John Simon had said about the British Government&apos;s belief in the League. The British Government were convinced that some such organisation was indispensable in the modern world. The only alternative was the alliances, &amp;c, which did not prevent the war of 1914.Another feature of the League to which importance was attached in Britain was the fact that it could never be effective if it did not include at least all the European nations. That was one reason why the British Government wanted Germany back.Mr. Eden did not follow Herr Hitler&apos;s argument about the victors and the vanquished. It was true that the Covenant was born of the Treaty of Versailles, but technically one could divorce the two. He wished to emphasise that in the minds of the British Government there could never be any conception but that Germany was the complete equal of the other Powers in the League itself and on the Council.Germany had entered the League after the Locarno Treaty. One service of that Treaty had been that it had brought to an end the conception of victors and vanquished. Then Germany took her place at the Council as one of its permanent members. There was no inferiority about that, and Germany had certainly been treated with full equality at Geneva.Mr. Eden was not surprised to hear that the German soldier never admitted to inferiority. He had never had any doubt on that point when he had been opposite the German soldiers in the line. He did not truly believe that amongst the other nations there was that sense of two classes. There were many nations at Geneva who had fought on either side in the war. Of course, if some technical change was wanted, the matter could be explored.The British Government did want Germany at Geneva, and British opinion did not understand why Germany or any other country that sincerely desired peace could not come back. Certainly no one in England wanted her in a place of inferiority.SIR JOHN SIMON enquired if the separation of the Covenant from the Treaty of Versailles would help to bring Germany back to Geneva. No doubt there were other points; but there was no use in spending time on formalities if that would not help.&apos; He fully appreciated the point of view that the Covenant would be better as a self-contained document standing by itself. He was sure that the founders of the League did not regard the Covenant as part of the Treaties. They were trying to create a world-wide thing. If the separation of the Covenant from the Treaty would alter Germany&apos;s point of view that would be a new reason for seeing if it could be done. If that matter would have a substantial influence, then they must try and cut the two documents adrift so that there should be no question of tying the Covenant to the tail of any Treaty.HERR HITLER said that as regards the League of Nations he had defined the German position in May 1933. Unfortunately his speech on that occasion was interpreted like the &quot;speeches of other German Chancellors, such as Herr Muller, Herr Fehrenbach, &amp;c. If his declaration on that occasion had been interpreted like his present speeches and like his future speeches would be, there would have been no misunderstanding.On that, occasion he had made it clear that Germany would not continue to participate in a disarmament conference and the League of Nations, &amp;c, if she was to remain a country of inferior right. That was still the position. He agreed with Mr. Eden that the problem was partly one of the technical separation of the Covenant and the Treaty. But what remained over and beyond that was the actual fact of Germany&apos;s position of inferiority on all those points which she had not rectified for herself.[11375] d   .&apos;
Germany had rectified for herself the questions of conscription and military, equality which touched her honour. He did not refer to European territorial questions. He knew that it was difficult to modify the territorial statute of Europe, unless Germany was ready to face the danger of the whole structure tumbling.He would give one illustration of the German position of inferiority. Suppose that Germany returned to the League and that Japan was still not a member. Then Germany would still not be thought fit to administer a colony, while Japan would administer a former German colony. What a clear illustration of German inferiority!Perhaps France and Britain did not derive advantage from the former German colonies. Perhaps Germany would not get anything out of them; and many Germans said so before the War; and added that England had conquered the good colonies whilst Germans were quarrelling about religion; and that nothing good had been left for them.Herr Hitler did not know the economic value of these colonies. Perhaps they had little economic value for the British Empire. Probably they caused financial loss to the British Empire and would cause financial loss to Germany too. But it was the moral and legal aspect of the question, and the whole position which Germany occupied in the world was affected by it.herr Hitler then produced a diagram on which the colonial possessions of the various Powers were illustrated, together with the corresponding size of their territories in Europe. Herr LTitler said that this diagram would give the British Ministers a clear idea of what he meant. It was a position of inequality and inferiority under which Germany, with a population of 68 millions and 460,000 square kilometres of territory with 137 inhabitants to each square kilometre had no colonies.This question of Germany&apos;s equality could not be solved by some solution which might be regretted on the following day by the Powers who were parties to the settlement. It could only be solved by absolute satisfaction on every side. No temporary solution was possible; the solution must take account of all the aspects of the question to which Herr Hitler had referred.If a satisfactory solution of this question was found, then Britain would have engaged Germany; and Germany would blindly and loyally fulfil her undertakings.Herr Hitler was not asking the impossible, because he knew that certain things were impossible now. But he was asking the absolute minimum; and if they looked into the distant future, the British Government might ask themselves whether British interests would be served by allowing Germany to become a pariah when she might have allowed Germany to take part with her.The moment would come when the European nations must stand together. For the time being theyT were engaged in preventing their own controversies from -exploding. But the moment might come when the European nations must stand together, in particular, when Germany and Britain must stand together.In times of peace there had never been hatred against Britain in Germany; and in the National Socialist movement there was no anti-British feeling.The German Government wanted agreement with Britain and also with France, but iii the case of the latter it was very difficult to dissipate certain misunderstandings; and an understanding with Britain would be a valuable asset.Herr Hitler&apos;s proposal was a very bold one, but as Germany knew that she could never defend alone her colonial possessions, so it might be that even the British Empire might one day be glad to have Germany&apos;s help and Germany&apos;s forces at her disposal. If they could find such a solution and give satisfaction to Germany&apos;s most urgent and primitive demands, they would lead Germany back to co-operation and friendly relations with Great Britain.He had outlined a bold idea, but he had wished to put it forward.SIR JOHN SIMON said that there had been frank speech on both sides; ;and he must now make two observations.First, Herr Hitler had been sketching out a thought in his mind which would seem to involve on the part of Britain some willingness to separate herself from general co-operation in Europe and which might almost seem an invitation to Britain to regard France as less associated with her than Germany.   The British
Government wished to have the closest association with Germany, but they wanted that without prejudice to their relations with France. They did not wish to substitute one friend for another, because they wanted to be loyal friends to all. He must say that at once. Otherwise he would not be acting faithfully to those who were not present that day.Britain had no special engagements. She was free and wished to remain free and to give friendship to all. But she was not open to the solicitation that she should not be faithful to her old relationships when seeking to improve relationships elsewhere.Secondly, as to the question of colonies, he took note of and would report what had been said, but he must point out that as regards mandated territories they were not at the sole disposal of Britain. Other Powers were concerned. It was right to point that out.Then as regards that large area which had represented British colonial territory on Herr Hitler&apos;s diagram, Herr Hitler must remember that that area included not only colonies comparable with the colonial possessions of other Powers, but the great Dominions of Canada, of the Union of South Africa, of the Commonwealth of Australia, and of New Zealand.There had no doubt been a time when those great Dominions had been dependent on Britain; but that had long since passed, and to-day they were in no sense whatever in a relationship to Britain comparable in any way to the colonies of other Powers. The matter was very important. He did not wish to leave the Chancellor under any misapprehension that he held out any hope what-ever that the British Government could do anything about the colonial question. He took note of what had been said and he would report. But he did not wish to leave the Chancellor under any mistaken impression.   It was best to be frank.(The meeting then adjourned.)111375j
THIRD MEETING. March 26, 1935, at 1030 a.m.NAVAL ARMAMENTS.SIR JOHN SIMON said that he regarded that morning&apos;s proceedings as a continuation of those of yesterday, and therefore had no general remarks to make at the moment. He proposed to take up the next subject on the programme, namely, armaments. He wished to make a statement about the naval side of this matter.The German Government would be aware that representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government had recently been engaged in bilateral conversations with representatives of a number of other Governments in view of the fact that. in 1935 the continuation or modification of existing naval treaties comes under consideration. He would like to inform the Chancellor what had been happening. Separate conversations had taken place in London with represen-tatives of the United States of America and Japan, and somewhat less elaborate conversations with representatives of France and Italy. The object in each case was to prepare the ground for the naval discussions of 1935.The first thing he had to say was that His Majesty&apos;s Government hoped that the German Government would take part in any general conference of naval Powers that might be held in the near future. With this in view, it would be useful if informal exchanges of views could now take place on the naval question between representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the German Government. London would probably be the best place for these. The conversations with the United States, France and Italy took place in London, and were conducted on their part by Ambassadors helped by technical assistants. His Majesty&apos;s Government would like in these discussions to learn from the German representatives the view of the German Government as to the requirements which Germany would wish to be discussed at a naval conference.It would be understood, of course, that this proposal was made without prejudice,to the validity of existing treaty provisions, and was made with all reserve on this point and without prejudice to any agreement regarding armaments generally which might be reached as part of the general settlement foreshadowed in the London communique.There was one other communication he would like to make on this subject. He wished to inform the German Government that the method that His Majesty&apos;s Government thought most likely to give results was not to raise or seek to formulate proposals in the form of ratios, but to consider whether it was possible to reach agreement a,bout programmes for the next period of years. During the preliminary discussions in London it bad been suggested that this period might run to 1942. No country was able in a very limited number of years to construct at an unlimited rate, whatever its ultimate programme might be. This applied to Great Britain as well as to other Powers. He therefore hoped that, in the preliminary Anglo-German discussions in London on naval issues preparatory to a general naval conference, this method would be thought practicable by the German Government. At the present stage, however, it was necessary to do no more than make the enquiry as to a preliminary meeting. The method His Majesty&apos;s Government hoped would be adopted would not pre-judge or lay down figures for the distant future by the method of ratios.HERR HITLER asked what would be the date of the Naval Conference. He said that this proposal came as a great surprise, and was completely new. Hitherto naval conferences had tried to fix ratios. The Washington Treaty had laid down ratios, up to which the parties were free to build or not as they wished. So far as the new proposal was concerned, he thought it necessary to say that a number of States were fully equipped with fleets sufficient for their needs under previous conferences. Under building programmes, building would be limited, or there might be no building at all. It might, for example, be -arranged that there should be no fresh construction for a period of five years. In that event Germany would not be able to build anything for five years, and
Germany&apos;s sovereign rights, which she could not in any event give up, would merely exist on paper.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the date for the naval conference had not yet been fixed and was a matter for negotiation.He wished at once to explain that the Chancellor was mistaken in supposing that he had proposed or indicated a method that was entirely novel. There were two quite distinct points. The first was the proposal that there should be a preliminary meeting between British and German representatives to see whether an exchange of views on naval subjects would be useful in preparation for the naval conference. He would be glad at some convenient time to receive a reply to this proposal. This proposal was, of course, made subject to reserves and without prejudice to the provisions of existing treaties.The second point was merely a piece of information, and not a proposal. His Majesty&apos;s Government were trying to do with Germany what they had already done with the other naval Powers. He wished therefore to inform the German Government that the method that His Majesty&apos;s Government had found most useful to consider was whether it would be possible to propound programmes. It was better that he should tell the Chancellor this than that he should not tell him. There was no occasion for surprise. The Chancellor may not have understood that the method did not mean that each State should have the same programme. What was intended was that States should discuss what their respective programmes should be. It was not suggested that X should be the same for all. Each countrjr would discuss with every other whether their requirements over a period of years could be stated in programmes rather than in ratios. This, surely, was not a very revolutionary proposal.BARON von NEURATH said there might have been a misunderstanding.HERR HITLER said that the first proposal was accepted.He added that even the proposed building programme would have some relation to each other, and that in the end the effect would be similar to that of ratios. It was obvious that, if Russia reconstructed her fleet, this must have repercussions on the German programme. In the same way, if France built giant ships of high speed, this must have its effect upon the German programme. There was bound to be interaction. It would probably not be possible to discover the best method until the conference met.On a point of principle, he wished to say that Germany did not want to pursue an unlimited naval armaments race as had been the case before the War. Germany did not think it politically necessary, and had not the necessary financial resources for such a race. On the other hand, Germany must take account of certain vital necessities in the matter of her own protection, and could not make those necessities dependent upon a conference the date of which had not been fixed and the results of which were not certain. While he was prepared to give -every assurance to His Majesty&apos;s Government that there would be no naval armaments race between Germany and Great Britain, Germany could not subordinate the requirements of her own security to a conference the date and result of which were unknown. If Russia and France increased their fleets, Germany must be in a position to do what she thought necessary to safeguard her own security.  No responsible Government could do otherwise.He wished also to make the. reservation that, at least from the theoretical point of view, a possible new agreement reached at the conference wouldvnot &quot;necessarily replace the Treaty of Versailles.SIR JOHN SIMON said, as regards this last observation, that the results of the naval conference were of course a matter for the future, but His Majesty&apos;s Government earnestly desired that an agreement should be reached which would take the place of existing provisions. All that he was concerned to make plain was that, in inviting the German Government to send representatives to London for a preliminary discussion on naval matters in preparation for the naval *conference, it was clearly understood that this invitation was not an abandon-ment of existing treaty provisions, but was given and accepted with all reserve On this point, because it was for the future negotiation to reach a new agreement.
eSir John Simon continued that Herr Hitler &quot;had. been- good; enough to say that Germany was not contemplating an. unlimited armaments ;race in the naval sphere. The British Ministers were, of course, very glad to hear that, f He thought, since they were speaking with such complete frankness and in order to inform one another, that he ought to point out that, a figure which he believed had been mentioned to the British Ambassador of 35 per cent, of the British fleet would appear to the British Government apart from any other question  to be so large as to make general agreement almost impossible. The result would therefore be, if that figure were insisted upon, to promote the unlimited armaments race which the Chancellor said the German Government wished to avoid.Such a figure would inevitably increase the demands of France, for the French figure was, roughly speaking, 50 per cent, of the British figure. If it&apos; really was contemplated that the German Government intended to build up to so large a figure as that indicated, that meant new tonnage, and therefore the most efficient ships. It was quite obvious that this must result in putting up the size of the French and therefore also of the Italian navy. This would have serious results on the British figures.The consequence would be that the unlimited armaments race which Germany wished to co-operate in avoiding would, in fact, be stimulated and hastened.Sir John Simon made this observation because he did not want the German Government to be under any misapprehension as to the view which the British Government would take on any such figure. But he understood that the Chancellor agreed that the preliminary meeting should take place in London, and that the best way in which the needs and intentions of the different Powers could be formulated would be a matter for consideration at that meeting.He only made the statement which he had just made because he thought it would be of no advantage to any one if there was any misunderstanding as to the grave impression which would be made on the British Government by the mention of the figure in question.HERE, HITLER said that there had been a mistake. The present ratio of the French fleet, he understood, was 35 per cent, of the British fleet, though under the Washington Agreement it had been 50 per cent.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the French fleet was at present in tonnage 50 per cent, of the British fleet or rather over. The Washington Treaty was not the only treaty which had to be considered. The Washington and London treaties must be taken together. In fact, if these two treaties were taken together, it would be found that French tonnage was 667,000, as against 1,200,000 tons of the British fleet. :   Those were the present figures.BARON von NEURATH then went out of the room to check these figures. He returned after a few minutes and admitted that the British figures were right.HERR HITLER said that his claim to 35 per cent, of the British fleet implied unequivocal recognition of British naval superiority. He emphasised that he did not make this claim for a limited period of 2, 5 or 6 years. Any assurance which he gave with regard to it would be for ever...:,On the other hand he did not see any heavenly or earthly authority who could force Germany to recognise the superiority of the French or Italian fleets.Germany&apos;s requirements for the protection of her trade were just as great as those of France or Italy for the protection of their trade.In those circumstances it was hard for him to see how a figure of 35 per cent, of the British fleet claimed by Germany could give any right to France to increase her percentage demand.... He claimed 35 per cent, of the British fleet for Germany, but not 35 per cent, for all the different categories of ships.lie based his claim on the need for the protection of the long coastline in the Baltic in particular, and further on the protection of German communications with East Prussia, which, for Germany, had almost become an overseas colony.As regards the objection that the 35 per cent, would be new tonnage, Herr Hitler said that he could not possibly build up the 35 per cent, within three or five,years. It would take much longer than that, and that would give other countries an opportunity to modernise their fleets.
23.,,-      0 *l-Further, his 35 per cent, would be burdened with the ships built under the Versailles conditions. The cruisers so built were too slow and inadequately armed.SIR JOHN SIMON took note of the agreement in principle for a meeting in London under the conditions indicated.HERR HITLER wished at this point to make an observation of principle. The meetings of the 25th March and of that morning were the first which he had had in this highly official manner with the representatives of the British Government.He thought that they were not in that room concerned with the problems of to-morrow or of the day after.But it was necessary to define the German conceptions and wishes as clearly as possible, so that on the basis of those clear definitions co-operation over a long period might be possible with all countries.He would therefore think it wrong to advance demands now in order to increase them after two or three years; and he would think it just as wrong to remain silent on demands which Germany would put forward after two or three years.For that reason he had very frankly and fully explained the conceptions held by the German Government as to the conditions to which Germany&apos;s return to the League of Nations must be subordinated and as to the possibilities of concluding a naval agreement.He had put forward Germany&apos;s demands in respect of that naval agreement frankly; he was guided not by the circumstances of the moment, but was taking account of a more distant future.It would be an impossible situation if Germany returned to the League to put forward new demands so far unknown to the world after two or three years. That might imply, if those demands were rejected, a fresh German withdrawal from Geneva.Thus there would be continuous disturbances and uneasiness.It was because he had put forward certain demands at that moment that he had thought it best to indicate those demands frankly. He well understood that their fulfilment could for the moment only be a fulfilment of principle; and that their practical realisation, e.g., as regards the navy, would have to take place in the course of time.KOVNO VERDICT.At this point HERR HITLER read out a telegram which he had just received announcing the Kovno verdict. He said that that was an illustration of what he had said on the preceding day, and showed the kind of co-operation existing in Eastern Europe. He asked what Britain would do if the Treaty of Versailles had torn away a part of her territory and placed it under a country like Lithuania, and if Englishmen merely because they were Englishmen were tortured and put in prison.MILITARY ARMAMENTS.Mr. EDEN said that the German Government must be aware that through-out the long negotiations on the armaments question the British Government had worked for agreement by every means they could find. In the post-war years they had reduced British armaments and tried to find a basis of international agreement.Mr. Eden wished first to ask if the German Government still wanted an arms limitation agreement.He would not conceal from the German Government that the recent announcement about the German Army had created a new set of difficulties in the way of agreement. It might even be said that upon the basis revealed by that announcement (viz., the 36 divisions) agreement seemed impossible. In all previous discussions parity between the Western European Powers had been accepted as the basis. . &apos;If these 36 divisions implied, as had been suggested to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, 500,000 men, that seemed a figure t6 which the other Western European Powers could never attain. It would make&apos;parity impossible and give ^Germany superiority.      !;    *       s . - .     , .        ; ... ;.    .
It was clear that the British Government could not accept-this&apos;.figure as a basis of&apos; discussion. Subject&apos; to that reserve he wished .to ask certain questions :- :(1) Was it correct that &quot;the- proposed German strength in effectives was 500,000 men.(2) What was to be the length of service and the role of the para-militaryformations and the police troops. (3) Would Labour Service be maintained. (4) What training would reservists receive in the future., Those were some of the questions on which the British Ministers would like information to enable them to assess the position.HERR HITLER then produced a diagram which showed the strengths in divisions of Germany and the neighbouring Powers as follows :  Germany : 36 divisions. .France : 34 divisions, plus 10 divisions in North Africa. Italy : 34 divisions. Czechoslovakia: 17 divisions. Belgium: 8 divisions. /     Poland : 34 divisions. /o^V       Russia: te/divisions.Herr Hitler then said that people were accustomed to compare with the 36 German divisions a French strength of 25 divisions. But the difference with the French strength as set out in the diagram was explained by the methods of counting adopted by France.France only counted infantry divisions, while Germany counted all forma-tiqns (infantry, police troops, cavalry, motorized troops and formations of short-term trained soldiers, the Landwehr).If that method was applied to the French strength, it would be found that France had 34 divisions to which must be added the 10 divisions in North Africa-It was comparatively easy for the French to bring over their North African troops to Europe; and Germany had no means of severing the communications between France and North Africa.it;.-,;! Therefore, France, in fact, had 44 divisions, as against the 36 German divisions.   Further, but of the 36 German divisions, 4 were in East Prussia.Again, there was in the German Agreement with Poland a specific clause stating that nothing in that agreement should in any way alter the arrangements existing between Poland and France. In the case, therefore, of a Franco-German war, 34 Polish divisions must be added to the French strength; and even if Poland was neutral there were 17 Czech divisions available. Then Italy had 34 divisions, too; and she (apart from the Swiss frontier) had a very short frontier to defend. Germany had a frontier of 3,600 kilometres.On the other hand, against the 36 German divisions were 101 (sic) Russian divisions.; - Now, in the Locarno Agreement, Germany had undertaken to respect the demilitarised zone; but in that zone there were no protective fortifications; and yet France had in that region a large network of fortifications. Moreover, the most easterly German fortifications on the East were very near Berlin.AIR ARMAMENTS. .Herr Hitler then produced a further diagram showing the strength of the Air Forces of the most important of Germany&apos;s neighbours. This diagram showed the following air strengths: Britain -&apos; ;&quot; : -.

Belgium- August 1934, first line, 246 machines; including reserves, 400 machines.April 1935, including reserves, 450 machines.SIR JOHN SIMON said he did not recognise the figure attributed by the diagram to Britain.   He thought we had 690 first line machines.MILITARY ARMAMENTS.Sir John Simon then asked what effectives the 36 divisions represented.HERR HITLER replied that the figure of 550,000 men would never be exceeded; and that that figure had not yet been reached. &apos;.&apos;Mr. EDEN asked if it was suggested that the French now had 500,000 men in France.HERR HITLER replied that with their North African troops they had 500,000 men. Herr Hitler said that he was chiefly speaking of France, Germany and Italy; but France had Russia and possibly Poland to help her. If Russia attacked Germany the latter had only Poland.Germany, moreover, had only begun to train her population within the last two years. In these circumstances the 101 Russian divisions could not be disregarded or the 17 Czech divisions.Finally, there was the fact that all the German frontiers were entirely unprotected.Herr Hitler then pointed out that France was now saying that she had comparatively weak classes, for she was entering the lean years. Therefore she had established two years&apos; service. But Germany also had lean years and only one year&apos;s service. If the German Government said that 550,000 men corresponded to 36 divisions, it was not absolutely necessary to have all these men with the colours. If Franco-German relations improved and real co-operation between the two countries became possible, then there might be some cuts. But the German Government&apos;s intention was to fix a figure which would not be exceeded even if the French introduced three years&apos; or five years&apos; or even seven years&apos; service.Mr. EDEN then asked if he was correct in assuming that the German period of service was one year. &apos; -: . HERR HITLER.replied in the affirmative; but the technical troops would have more. He added that the police troops would now definitely pass to the army. . t &quot;Mr. EDEN enquired about para military formations. ...HERR HITLER replied that there were ho para military.formations in Germany. He added that; in foreign countries para military organisations received training with rifles even at Eton. &apos;       &quot; -[11375]  &apos; . &apos; E
HERR RIBBENTROP- said thatItwas a;&apos;wrong conception&apos;;&apos;&apos;&quot;and that there were no para military organisations in Germany.SIR JOHN SIMON enquired if the S.S. were included in the 550,000 men.BARON von NEURATH replied in,the affirmative and said that there was one division of S.S.SIR ERIC PHIPPS asked if the labour service counted; and the CHANCELLOR replied that they did not count at all.HERR HITLER said that out of the total S.S. only 10,000 men were armed; one-third of these was in Bavaria, one-third in Berlin, and one-third in the rest of Germany.Mr, EDEN asked about war material. &apos;BARON von NEURATH said that the German Government had destroyed it all under the Control Commission, but war material took so long to make that they were obliged to work night and day in Germany to replace what had been destroyed.HERR HITLER said that the German Government required the necessary material for 36 divisions, plus reserves.Mr. EDEN asked about big guns; and the CHANCELLOR said that Germany wanted all the arms possessed by other countries. &apos;BARON von NEURATH said that if other countries would abandon types of arms, Germany would do the same.Mr. EDEN asked if the German Government would agree not to construct certain types of material above a certain limit if other Powers did the same.BARON von NEURATH replied in the negative, because other countries had /stocks.Mr. EDEN asked again if Germany would not construct above a certain; limit if the other countries agreed.THE CHANCELLOR repeated that the other countries had stocks already. He then said that, in principle, Germany would participate in any agreement for international limitation. If there was an agreement that on the 1st January,. 1938, no nation should possess guns over 15 cm., Germany would not have such guns from that date. Such an agreement would, of course, not prevent Germany from possessing such guns up to that date and, if necessary and other Powers agreed, destroying them afterwards.If other Powers had certain material Germany could not be defenceless.Herr Hitler added that he did not believe that any nation would destroy a gun as long as it thought that gun represented an advantage over others. It would only destroy a gun when it knew that it constituted no advantage.SIR JOHN SIMON enquired whether, if an agreement were reached covering arms limitation, Germany would still be prepared to accept and work a system of permanent automatic supervision, in order to ascertain that the agree-merit was being duly observed and upon the understanding that such supervision applied to all Powers equally. .HERR HITLER said that the German Government would certainly accept that. . &apos;He added that he would like to ask Sir John Simon a question. What were the British Government&apos;s views regarding the proportionate strength between Germany and Russia, in view particularly of. the approaching Franco-Russian, alliance which the German Government believed already existed in the form of a. military agreement- -        .Britain declared she required the strongest Fleet. He thought that was-just arid fair, because of her position. But what was the British view on the German proportion to Russia and France,?   - y -    .Mr. EDEN replied that the table in the British Draft Convention -?(the so-called MacDonald Plan) gave Germany, France and Italy equality at 200,000
effectives; and. gav;e Russia iSOQjOQO. He remembered that it. was general ly agreed at Geneva that a soldier &quot;of. Eastern Europe did. not count as high as one from Western Europe.HERR HITLER enquired what was the relative value of a,Russian tank as compared with the German tank. He claimed that a Russian bomber would fight just as well as a German bomber.Herr Hitler then produced a chart showing the distribution of industry throughout Germany. The iron and steel industries were located in an unfortified region, the demilitarised zone; so were a large part of the coal-mines.Mr. EDEN said that nobody wanted to touch Germany, especially in the west; and there was Locarno.HERR HITLER replied that Germany had no protection all the same; and that it was a very short way by air from the frontier to the industrial districts of the centre.AIR ARMAMENTS.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the Chancellor had shown on his diagram that Germany was to have 36 divisions; but there was nothing in that diagram about the strength of the German Air Force.HERR HITLER said that he had left open two matters: the question of the strength of the fleet and that of parity in the air between Great Britain, France and Germany if Russian development was not such that revision of the figures by common agreement would become necessary.Herr Hitler said that Russia based her 100 divisions exclusively on the number of her population, because she was not exposed to attack; and she was building, too, the greatest air fleet in the world. Germany was very modest in not basing her army on the numbers of the population and in asking only for parity with Britain and France.SIR JOHN SIMON said that in the United Kingdom there was an Air Force which was a metropolitan force. The first line strength of that force was 690 machines. But, on the other side of the world, the British Government had certain other first line machines.Sir John Simon enquired whether, when the Chancellor referred to parity, he meant parity with the Air Force in the United Kingdom or overseas also.ITERR HITLER said that if Britain would bring her air strength for the United Kingdom up to the French strength, i.e., to parity with France, then it would be that parity which Germany would demand.If Britain persuaded France to come down to the British level, the German Government would be delighted, because they would have to spend less on their Air Force. But even if Britain did not consider herself threatened by France and preferred to have a smaller force than France, Germany could not help it because of the necessity of protecting herself.HERR von RIBBENTROP said that Germany did not care how many aerojDlanes there were in England.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the Chancellor had explained that he was claiming parity with the metropolitan Air Force so far as the United Kingdom was concerned, but what did he mean when he talked of Britain coming up to the French figure ? Was he referring to the air strength in Metropolitan France or to the larger figure which included the air strength in the French colonies and even in places like Indo-China on the other side of the world ?HERR HITLER replied that the distance from East Prussia to the Rhine-land was the same as the distance from North Africa to France. The parity which he demanded was parity with the Force in Metropolitan France plus that in North Africa.Herr Hitler added that there could be no question of German hegemony over Europe. What was in question, was the hegemony of Russia or the hegemony of a combination of smaller States with France.SIR JOHN SIMON said there was one more question he must ask. When he had, asked Herr Hitler what air force he claimed, the ^Chancellor had. [11375] &apos; p
:,r.j yK; Annex I.:\   :i .-, Eastern Pact.In the opinion of the German Government the Powers interested in East European questions might, following up the fundamental ideas of the Kellogg Pact, conclude a pact on the following basis : 1. The contracting Powers agree not to resort to aggression or to force in any form against one another.2. The contracting Powers agree to conclude among themselves, as far as they have not yet done so, treaties of arbitration and conciliation providing for an obligatory procedure of arbitration in the case of disputes of a legal nature, and-for a procedure of conciliation with a view to arriving at an amicable settle-ment in matters of political conflicts.3. If, nevertheless, one of the contracting Powers believes itself to be threatened with aggression or with the employment of force on the part of another contracting Power, then, on the demand of the Power in question, a conference of ^representatives of the Governments of all contracting Powers will immediately be convened, in order to deliberate on the situation and, if necessary, on the steps to be taken for the maintenance of peace.4. If, in spite of the above agreement, hostilities should break out between any two contracting Powers, the other contracting Powers engage not to support the, aggressor in any way, neither economically nor financially nor in a military \ way.!;&apos;. ;.-&apos; The pact is to be concluded for a period of ten years, with the possibility of extension for a further period.said parity with Britain and&quot;Janice:&quot;&apos;&apos;&quot; .Nowr&apos;it would be very material to the discussion if Herr Hitler was able ;to state the strength of the German Air Force &apos; as it was. He felt obliged to put the question.&apos;HERE, HITLER replied&apos;&apos; that&apos;&apos; Germany ^had reached parity with Great Britain.: Herr Hitler said that if Russia continued to build on the present scale she Would be the greatest Power in Europe. He saw the Russian danger, though he felt himself to be a solitary prophet in the desert. But, later, people would find out that he had been right.EASTERN PACT.BARON von NEURATH then handed to the British Ministers the note on the Eastern Pact contained in Annex I.(The meeting then adjourned.)
FOURTH MEETING/. March 26, 1935, at 4 &apos;p.M.NAVAL ARMAMENTS.!t . SIR JOHN SIMON said, with reference to the proposed naval conversation, it is, I think, clearly understood between us that the invitation is given in order to prepare for the Naval Conference, which will aim at a new naval agreement m the future. Accordingly, if I have hereafter to make a statement m England about the basis of our meeting, I will employ the terms I have just used and in the meantime I understand it is agreed that neither side will make any statement about the Naval Conference and that what I have said will hereafter dehne the basis of our meeting.&quot;SIR JOHN SIMON said that the one subject which now remained was the air pact.In the thought of His Majesty&apos;s Government the air pact which they had joined in proposing would be strictly in line with the scope and obligations of the Locarno Treaty. It would involve obligations and action by a signatory in the cases to which Locarno applies. But though it would not therefore apply to a new class of case, it would involve greater precision in two respects.In the first place, in the event of unprovoked aggression by air attack, it would oblige the signatories to come immediately to the aid of the attacked party. There would not be a discussion at Geneva first.In the second place, the method by which the signatories would undertake to perform their obligations immediately would be by use of their air forces.These were the two elements which would be characteristic of the air pact. They would not be new in the sense that a country would be under an obligation to act in a case which did not come under the obligations of Locarno. But they would make more precise and more immediate the cases to which Locarno applied.The second point about the air pact would be this. His Majesty&apos;s Government were glad to take part in putting forward the idea, because it seemed to them that recent developments of the possibility of sudden and violent attack by air over the borders of a country had become much more prominent since Locarno was signed, and the slower methods which would be appropriate if there was to be the mobilisation of an army would be quite inappropriate in the event of sudden and almost instantaneous use of air power. The object, therefore, would not be so much to secure that if one of the signatories disregarded its obligations that signatory would suffer by reprisal, as to create so strong a deterrent and so strong a reason to know beforehand that a sudden assault would not be to the advantage of the aggressor, that there would be every inducement for the signatories to refrain from disregarding their obligations.There was also a third point. His Majesty&apos;s Government would greatly regret if the conclusion of an air pact could possibly have the consequences of appearing to recognise as legitimate indiscriminate attacks from the air upon the civil population and industrial areas. His Majesty&apos;s Government would therefore like it to be carefully considered, by those who were studying the idea qf an air pact whether it would not be possible to introduce, perhaps only by way of preamble or by some general expression, a repudiation by all signatories of indiscriminate attacks from the air as being contrary to the rules which should be observed by all. It would probably need a good deal of thought to find the proper expression for this idea.Finally, His Majesty&apos;s Government conceived the air pact as not being the document which should contain the figures for air strengths. The air pact itself would merely pledge the signatories to use air forces for the purposes and in the manner described. It followed that air strengths must be agreed in some other documents. His Majesty&apos;s Government thought of the air pact, therefore,, not as being an agreement that could be reached quite apart from other agreements, hut ^s forming a portion of that more general agreement which wasBARON von NEURATH agreed.AIR PACT.[11375]f 2

If one took the five Locarno Powers and made an agree-ment between them, it would, unless qualified, involve, inter alia, Britain assisting 1 V //   V y  /9^erniany a&amp;ainst Italy and Italy Britain against France.I tc^tA^ff I So he thought that a protocol might be added to say that there would be no l/di^^Wf^&apos; / obligation uponJanV&quot; -sAgaatopy. to assist another signatory unless theyiasmgv I -tn/ r^^y/^ sig-&amp;ate*wifc^Eas already under obligation to do so.I   .HERR HITLER and BARON von NEURATH agreed.;HERR HITLER said that the idea and proposal of the Air Pact had two aspects.The first aspect was very clear and practical and could be realised comparative 1 y easily. The German Government gave their wholehearted support to that aspect of the Pact. That was the Air Pact properly speaking. The German Government also particularly liked the idea of the prohibition of indiscriminate bombing of densely populated regions. The German Government I thought such indiscriminate bombing was in itself in absolute contradiction withthe Geneva Red Cross Convention, because women and children would be bombed i even if the attack was not- accompanied by a gas attack.The German Government were entirely in favour of the Air Pact proper and p?rj readyito join it at any moment.   For that reason they regretted that the BritishGovernment thought it necessary to subordinate the Air Pact to the realisation of an international settlement about air strengths.The German Government thought it particularly regrettable that the order \ of priority contemplated by the British Government was first an international1- agreement on the limitation of air forces and only after that the conclusion of\ an Air Pact.This order of priority was regrettable because the Air Pact itself was such a, clear and practical proposal.- Heir Hitler thought that the second aspect of the proposal, the limitation of air &quot;forces, raised many difficult and complicated problems which it would take ,f long to settle.Further, it was regrettable that while the Air Pact was to be concluded by a limited number of nations, it was to be subordinated to general conditions which wei&apos;e:quite outside the disposal of the signatories of the Air Pact. Herr Hitler gave the following example : Kr&apos;l In &quot;order to have an Air Pact, it would be necessary to reach agreement on )- - the limitation of the air forces not only of the Locarno Powers but also respectingi the, air. strengths of other countries quite outside.  Now if Russia&apos;s air strengthwesre to be four times as great as at the moment, Germany would have to draw consequences from that. Russia, moreover, was dependent on the Japanese air strength, and, therefore, the British proposal really meant that a problem which applied, to a limited territory and which was clear in itself would be subordinated to&apos; imponderables throughout the world.^fij,Therefore the Chancellor regretted the order of priority in which the two\. pfp;posals were made.:y.l. pJV^e,&quot;added that Germany might be very glad if an international settlementI oh air strengths could be reached because even under the parity proposals sheilk. would ;not   be the strongest Power.

If the Pact came first it would greatly improve the atmosphere for the parity agreement, for its existence would deprive air forces of much of their value. The signatories of the Air Pact would be very content if air armaments could be limited and financial burdens alleviated. &apos;   ^He thought they should contemplate first the Air Pact and then, the Air Pact having deprived the air forces of some of their value, the countries would be less opposed to reduction of air strengths. V;.If parity could be realised among the signatories of the Air Pact,&apos;those countries might form the pacifying bloc from which a fresh effort to limit air strengths might be made. &quot;i &quot;SIE JOHN SIMON thanked the Chancellor for his clear explanation on this very important point. What the Chancellor had said would be carefully studied and considered. He did not think it quite correct to speak of am. order of priority for the idea contained in the London communique was simultaneous, negotiation. If there were some prospect of making progress on the other subjects mentioned in the London communique it certainly would not be necessary to postpone the Air Pact negotiations until everything else had been settled..,;. .The idea underlying the London communique was that a number of matters should be pursued by discussion between the Governments. He agreed that the Air Pact was a simpler and limited conception because it only applied to,five Powers and the subject matter was simpler. aiThere was one other observation he must make. He was very glad to hear the Chancellor say that this opportunity should be used to promote together and with other States the vitally important object of the prohibition of bombing.,He had seen statements that the German Government and the Chancellor himself favoured efforts to prohibit bombing. He would remind the German Ministers that the British proposal of March ISS^contained provisions directed to that object. It provided that the Permanent Disarmament Commission should, take up without delay the preparation of an agreement which would prohibit military and naval aircraft; but at the same time it pointed out that that would never be possible unless there was adequate control of civil aircraft.A similar reflection occurred to him about bombing. Undoubtedly civil and commercial machines as now constructed had a power of lift and range and. very considerable speed; and in the nature of things were constructed to carry bombs as well as passengers.What was the German Governments view on this point? ,\ :In England people were deeply concerned at the danger which all nations might be preparing for one another while the useful and peaceful service;, of the air was developed. l,&apos;l;He would like to know if the Chancellor when mentioning the restriction of bombing had considered how it could be secured that machines destined for civilian purposes could defeat the prohibition against bombing.        rnirmxi srftHERR HITLER said that he would first make an observation of principle.&quot; The reason why so many attempts to reach agreement had failed was because negotiators followed the practice of film companies which he understood was called &quot; block booking.&quot; Film companies tried to sell good and bad filins together.- So also in international affairs the attempt was made to deal-with -easy and difficult questions together. People seemed bent on getting &apos; all1 or nothing. The Chancellor preferred another method, namely, that which,1 while bearing all questions in mind for ultimate settlement, tried for the momOhldrilv to achieve what was possible. This was the method which he thought plight to be followed. - ;toAs regards air bombing, this, he said, was not a military question&apos;/of technical possibilities, but a question of reaching international agreement;1 W which signatories would undertake not to use these technical possibilities-1 for1 aWU*a^^i*Mes* dfto^mmkm^m^M ,UnleW civrKaviaticm&apos; was Polished ..altogetJheffpfeiv4l ^rdMftIfeollidleb^gp^v^d&apos;%Pai p!dssibifey3l6f use&apos;1^or Mfita^f

In the same way, in spite of the technical possibility of using civil aircraft for military purposes, it would be possible to come to an international agreement not to do so. This might be achieved by some amendment of the Red Cross Convention.In this matter also they ought to aim at such agreement as was immediately realisable. What might be achieved at once were : (1) the prohibition of the use of gas and incendiary bombs; (2) the limitation of bombing to the fighting-zones; (3) possibly the complete prohibition of all bombardment, from the air. This had nothing to do with technical possibilities, hut could be the subject of international agreements which would embody the will of the signatories.SIR JOHN SIMON said that he would report what the Chancellor had said to his colleagues. He would also consult with other Governments and perhaps, if the Chancellor allowed, communicate further with the German Government.CONCLUSION.SIR JOHN SIMON recalled that the conversations had opened with a mutual promise to speak with frankness. This they had carried out. He thanked the Chancellor for the opportunity he had had of meeting him personally and for the way in which the British Ministers had been welcomed.But, observing the rule of frankness to the end, he must say that the British Ministers did feel somewhat disappointed that it had not been possible in these two. days to get a larger measure of agreement. They regretted that such difficulties were thought to exist on the German side in connexion with some of the matters discussed. He did not in the least regret having come to Berlin. He was sure that this meeting was the best way of continuing this investigation into the various points of view. What he regretted was that they had not been able to do more in the direction of promoting the general agreement which he was sure both sides wanted.It showed that these things were more difficult and complicated than many well-wishers believed them to be from a distance. At the same time, he felt that they had gained very much by learning so frankly the point of view of the German Government; and he hoped that the German Government felt that it had been valuable to learn from the British Ministers the points on which they felt that difficulties in the way of agreement still lay.Mr. Eden and he would report to the British Government, who would continue to use their utmost efforts in the spirit of friendly co-operation.The British Ministers were sincerely thankful for the way in which they had been received in Berlin, and would take away very pleasant memories of the kindness and hospitality shown them.H.ERR HITLER wished to assure the British Ministers how happy he had been to talk frankly with them. The gratitude of the German Government for  he visit was shared by the German nation. The German Government were very much gratified by this opportunity of free and frank discussion.Herr Hitler was also grateful to the British Government for the loyal efforts, they had made in the matter of the Saar vote, and for all the other matters on which they had adopted such a loyal and generous attitude to Germany. Herr Hitler thanked Sir John Simon in particular for the loyal attitude of an officer of the Saar police, which had prevented a very dangerous situation; he referred to Major Hennessy.Herr Hitler had tried to give the British Ministers a sincere and frank picture of what the German Government wanted and what were their views.He asked them to gather from that picture not that Germany was not ready to co-operate in bringing about European solidarity, but that Germany hoped to co-operate.
fl 1 tl 1/ &amp;Annex I.Communique. . -The Anglo-German conversations conducted between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir John Simon, and the Lord Privy Seal, Mr. Anthony Eden, and the German Chancellor and the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, Baron von Neurath, in the presence of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Sir Eric Phipps, and the German Commissioner, Herr von Ribbentrop, which have taken place during the last two days, were concluded to-night. The subjects under discussion were the matters set out in the London Communique of the 3rd February. The conversations have been carried Oh&apos;-in-the frankest and friendliest spirit, and have resulted in a complete clarification of the respective points of view. It was established that the aim of the policy of both Governments is to secure and strengthen the peace of Europe by promoting international co-operation. Both the British and the German Ministers are satisfied as to the usefulness of the direct conversations which have been taking place.Sir John Simon will leave Berlin by aeroplane to-morrow on his return to&apos; London, while Mr. Eden will proceed as arranged to Moscow, Warsaw and Prague.But-he; hoped :the/jB^ Minister s would have seen the difliuidty .oi&apos; tile German Governments position; theywerestruggling to lift, up a country which had lived duiPing-^e^e^s^unjier. $QX$, &apos;&amp;qj$$iiQ$.&apos;&apos;.&quot;^9*8 trying; to lift her1 to that level of equality where the other;nations were.   !   : &apos;..&quot;......In taking over the past from previous German Governments Herr Hitler had decided to liquidate it honestly and sincerely. If he came into international&apos; agreements he would bring into them another Germany to that of the past 16 years; otherwise the value of those agreements would be diminished.The German Government had in mind as an ultimate end not the establish; ment of a hegemony, which must always be a theory, but the establishment of a community of nations in which Germany would co-operate as an equal member.If some claims put forward by Germany seemed excessive, the British Ministers must not forget that they had been discussing not a settlement for 1935, but the solution of problems which would take long to settle and could only be settled in a distant future.Without a fundamental revision of Germany&apos;s present position they could not find a solution of pending problems.Herr Hitler said that in his political life he was not a man who went in and out. At a certain moment he had regretted leaving the League. It was the ardent desire of the German people and Government to be able to return to the League on conditions, however, which would render impossible the recurrence of a situation in which in order to re-establish Germany&apos;s equality of status they might be forced to withdraw again.The British Ministers should be convinced that many of the German objections arose out of the feeling that if the present German Reich gave an undertaking, and freely gave it. it would be necessary for the Reich more strictly to observe such an undertaking than any other State in order to restore the reputation-tion which had been lost in the last 16 years.Herr Hitler would not sign anything which he thought he could not accept;. but if he gave an undertaking he would never break it. &apos;The communique was then drafted and appears as Annex I to these notes.(The meeting was then concluded.)
