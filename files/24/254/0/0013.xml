THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT   J  Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1935:SECRET Copy No.     40CP. 58 (35).CABINET.NEW HEBRIDES CONDOMINIUM.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theSecretary of State for the Colonies.THE question of the future of the New Hebrides Condominium was discussed at the 193(5 Imperial Conference, and the conclusions reached were:  (a) That the Foreign Office be invited to open negotiations with the FrenchGovernment for the withdrawal of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom from the Condominium, subject to essential guarantees for the protection of missionary and other British interests on the lines recommended in the Report of a Committee of the Conference.(b) That the Dominions concerned be kept in touch with the progress of thenegotiations.2. Shortly afterwards a fundamental change occurred in the financial position of the Condominium Administration (i.e., the Joint Services Adminis-tration). For several years previous to 1930, the Joint Administration had been self-supporting. The Condominium accounts for 1930, however, revealed -a substantial excess of Expenditure over Revenue; and the budget for 1931 could not be balanced. This meant that the United Kingdom and French Governments were called upon to contribute towards the maintenance of the joint services, in addition to sums which they were each providing for separate national services.3. The position was reviewed by the Cabinet in March 1932, and it was then decided: (i) That, in view of the material change in circumstances since theImperial Conference of 1930, unless a particularly opportune occasion for reopening the matter should occur sooner, the question of approaching the French Government for the purpose of terminating the British-French Condominium in the New Hebrides be postponed until early in 1934, by which time it is hoped that the joint adminis-tration may again be self-supporting; and(ii) That the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments be informed accordingly.4. The hope that the Condominium Administration would again be self-supporting by 1934 has not been realised; and in the circumstances we see no real alternative to proposing a further postponement of the question of an approach to the French Government for the purpose of ending the Condominium. The conditions for such an approach are manifestly unfavourable while the Joint Administration is not paying its way. For obvious reasons, it is undesirable to abandon the British share of the administration of the New Hebrides without compensation, but so long as the joint administration is being run at a loss it is useless to expect that any quid pro quo could be obtained from the French Government.[11322]
5.   We accordingly invite our colleagues to agree : (i) That, in view of the fact that the New Hebrides Condominium Adminis-tration is not at present self-supporting, and the uncertainty as to when its finances will be rehabilitated, the question of an approach to the French Government for the purpose of terminating the British-French Condominium in the New Hebrides be further postponed, say until 1939, unless a particularly opportune occasion for reviewing the question should occur sooner; and (ii) That the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments be informed accordingly.(Initialled) J. H. T.P. C.-L.Downing Street, March 18, 1935
