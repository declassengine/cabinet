COPY NO.CP.78 (35).C-cabinet.PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OP UNEMPLOYMENT TO TERRITORIALSTAKING PART IN JUBILEE CELEBRATIONS ON 6TH MAY OR ALTERNATIVE DAYSMemorandum by the Minister of Labo\ir.At their meeting on Wednesday, 3rd April, the Cabinet decided that an unemployed territorial ought not to lose money as a result of attending a parade during the Jubilee celebrations, and that the Secretary of State for ?fer and the Minister of Labour should try to find a solution of the difficulty which exists in this respect.. It is understood that the Unemployment Assistance Board do not propose to have regard to anything which the territorials may receive by way of Army pay and allowances for duty on 6th May or alternative days when determining allowances under the Unemployment Assistance Act.    No question therefore arises in those cases.     With regard to territorials who are in receipt of unemployment benefit, it has not been found possible to find a way by which it could be held that benefit conditions were satisfied by them if in fact they were attending a parade during the Jubilee celebrations.       As a result, however, of consulta-tions between the War Office and the Ministry of Labour, it has been arranged that the War Office will make good to the man the unemployment benefit he loses. As a matter of machinery the payment would be made in such cases at the usual rate of benefit at the Employment Exchanges so that the amount the individual will receive will not be affected by his attendance at a parade, and that where it is known that individuals have in fact attended parades, the War Office^ will refund to the Ministry of Labour the amounts paid in lieu of benefit under this arrangement.     The Treasury are agreeable to this arrangement.Subject to the approval of the Cabinet, it is proposed to take the course indicated so as to ensure that territorials attending parades shall receive the amounts to which they would otherwise have been entitled, in addition to their Army pay and allowances.(inta,.)o. s.8th April, 1955.H.Q.255 - 65.D.E.
