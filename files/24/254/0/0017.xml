THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1935.Copy No.CABINET.FORTHCOMING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OFTHE COMMONWEALTH.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN paragraphs 3 and 6 of my recent Memorandum as to the discussions which will take place with the Dominion Prime Ministers at the time of the Silver Jubilee Celebrations (CP. 39 (35)), I mentioned that Mr. Lyons would be arriving in this country in advance of the other Prime Ministers with a view to a preliminary discussion of the economic position, especially in regard to meat.Mr. Lyons has now informed us that he and his colleagues will arrive in England on Thursday, the 21st March. Discussions with them will presumably begin early in the following week.The Departments primarily concerned (the Dominions Office, the Board of Trade, and the Ministry of Agriculture) are preparing the necessary material, on the United Kingdom side, for these discussions.I expect that the Cabinet will agree, in pursuance of the decision taken last year not to have anything in the nature of an Imperial Economic Conference, that the discussions with Mr. Lyons and his colleagues should be kept informal, but it seems desirable to make some preliminary arrangements for their conduct.In view of the fact that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth leads the Australian delegation, it would, I think, be desirable that the Prime Minister or the Lord President of the Council should preside over the first meeting. Subject to this, I suggest that the Ministers primarily concerned, namely, the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and myself, should be appointed as a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet for the- purpose of conducting the discussions. We should naturally consult other Ministers, and the Cabinet  is  1 whole, where necessary.(Initialled) J. H. T.Dominions Office, March 16, 1935.SECRET. CP. 61 (35).[11317]
