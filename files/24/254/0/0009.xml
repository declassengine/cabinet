this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 54 (351.CABINET.THE IRISH FREE STATE AND APPEALS TO THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE appeal from the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State, in the case known as the Erne Fishery Case, came before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on the 3rd and 4th December last on the preliminary question whether recent legislation in the Irish Free State has been effective to deprive His Majesty in Council of the prerogative right to grant special leave to appeal against a decision of the Supreme Court of the Free State.Notice of the hearing was by direction of the Privy Council served upon me and upon the Attorney-General, and the Attorney-General, in compliance with the request of the Privy Council, attended the hearing. The Respondents in the case, including the Attorney-General for the Irish Free State, did not appear; argument was heard only on behalf of the appellants and after two days the Judicial Committee adjourned the hearing in order that it might hear the arguments in the case of the Canadian petition of the British Coal Corporation v. The King, a petition which involves a similar question in respect of Canada, and on which the Respondents to that petition, as represented by the Dominion Government, will appear to present the arguments on behalf of the Dominion. Both Petitions will come before the Judicial Committee for hearing on the 18th March. During the previous hearing of the Irish petition, the Judicial Committee expressed a desire to hear later His Majesty&apos;s Attorney-General on the question of law; and also to know the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom upon the legislative competence of the Irish Free State. It is difficult to appreciate how such views can be relevant to the question of law which the Judicial Committee is to decide, but as the Committee may press the Attorney-General upon the point, I think it right to inform my colleagues of the line that from the political point of view it would seem desirable to follow if the Attorney-General is called upon by the Judicial Committee to express the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government.1. That in general, and in particular in the case of Canada, the Prerogative of His Majesty to grant special leave to appeal from the Courts of a Dominion is a prerogative which relates to the affairs of that Dominion and, where the Statute of Westminster has now removed the restrictions resulting from the joint operation of the Judicial Committee Acts and the Colonial Laws Validity Act, the restriction of that prerogative is a matter within the legislative competence of the Parliament of the Dominion.2. That, with regard to the Irish Free State, different considerations apply. The status of the Irish Free State in the British Commonwealth is based upon the Treaty of 1921, which contains an implied, but none the less definite, obligation on the part of the Irish Free State not to interfere with the prerogative right of His Majesty in Council to grant special leave to appeal. Whether or not the recent legislation in the Irish Free State purporting to abolish this prerogative right is, as a matter - of strict law, within the competence of the Free State[11290]
Legislature, having regard to the inclusion of the Free State in the Statute of Westminster, it is a breach of the Treaty of 1921 and a repudiation of the settlement which was then&quot; arrived at.Stated in this way, this seems to me to follow the line which the Government have taken from time to time and conforms to the statement which I made in  Ee House of Commons in November 1933, at the time the legislation in question passed by the Irish Free State Legislature.The Attorney-General concurs with these views, but I gather that he also thinks it possible that a&apos;legal argument might be founded on the views set out under 2 above to the effect that as the status of the Irish Free State is based on the Treaty, any legislative act which is repugnant to the Treaty would be outside the competence of the Free State Legislature.It will be appreciated, however, that such an argument would not find support from the Cosgrave party in the Free State and, in these circumstances, I gather that the Attorney-General would not think it proper to advance any such argument on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom without the approval of the Cabinet.The issues raised are of considerable political importance, and I should like an opportunity of explaining them to my colleagues. I would suggest that the Attorney-General should be invited to be present when the matter is being considered by the Cabinet.J. H. T.Dominions Office, March 11, 1935. .A
