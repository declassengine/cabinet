Imports in February,  at  56.3 m., were  1.1 m.  less than in February,  1934.    Imports of food,  drinic and tobacco increased by  0.7 m.  and of articles wholly or mainly manufactured by  0.4 m.    Imports of raw materials decreased by  2.0 m.,   imports of wool being  2.7 m.  less than a year ago.    Exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures were  34.1 m.,  or  4.0 m. more than last February.    The increase was due to larger exports of manufactured goods.    Re-exports were  4.4 m.,  as compared with  5.2 in. a year ago.EMPLOYMENT.    Employment in February showed  an improvement as compared with January.      The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges at 25th February was 2,285,463 which is 39,910 less than a month earlier.The main variations were:-London ............... - 13,636South Eastern ........ - 6,291South Western ........ - 5,811Midlands ............. - 7,152North Eastern........ -t- 5,188North Western ........ - 13,955Scotland............. - 6,907Wales ................ -h 8,654The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 inemployment at 25th February was 10,081,000.    This was 28,000more than a month earlier and 136,000 more than in February,1934.There was considerable improvement in employment in building,  tailoring and boot and shoe manufacture.    Some improvement was also shown in most of the other clothing trades, in public works contracting,  tinplate, woollen and worsted, pottery,  cocoa,  chocolate    etc. making,  and shipping services.
On the other hand there was a marked decline in employment in coal, mining and  slight reductions also occurred in cotton,  do ok: and harbour services,  and the distributive trades.RAIL^AHD ROAD TRAFFIC.    During the four weeks ended 24th February,   railway traffic receipts fell by  150,000  (l.4%) as compared with the corresponding period of 1934,  decreases of 3.02$! and 2.35$! respectively occurring in coal,  coke and other fuel and in other freight traffic, while there was an increase of 0.71$ in passenger traffic.    The tonnage conveyed by freight trains in 1934 was 19.0 m.  tons  (7.6$i) more than in 1933.    The tonnage of iron ore carried increased by 5.0 m. tons (50.2%),  of iron and steel by 3.0 el.  tons  (25.0$) and of pig iron by .5 m,  tons  (20.1%). ; ;&apos;SHIPPING.      The index number for shipping freights for February (1913      100) was 73.59 and is less favourable than in January (79.35)  and in February last year (81.24).BANKINO;.    Owing to the continued weakness of Bill Rates, the Clearing. Banks announced on the 22nd February that they would not buy or tender for bills at rates lower than their rate for loans to the Market against bills.    as a result,  the Market buying rate rose to 9/l6th and the Treasury Bill Tender Rate from 5/- to 8/4d.    This step also had the effect of reducing the volume of outside money available at the dollar showed a tendency to rise.    Gold reached a record price of 144/Id. on   February 23 th,  and silver,  on the demand from   -v America and the East,  rose to 25 ll/l6d.,  its highest price since 1929.COAL.      The average weekly output for the quarter ended 23rd February was 4.59 n.  tons as compared with 4.62 in.  tons in the same quarter of 1934,  a decrease of  .65%.    The average number of persons employed during this period was 770,000 as compared with 782,200 a year ago.
Exports in February amounted to 2.80 m.  tons as compared with 3,36 m. tons a year ago0      Exports were lower to most destinations,  including Scandinavian countries,  Germany,  France and Italy.      There were small increases in exports to Algeria and Argentina.On the whole the tone of the industry may be regarded as being fairly strong.IRON AND STEEL.      Though production was well maintained, a rather uncertain tendency developed in February and new business was somewhat unsatisfactory.      The recent fall in sterling has restricted purchases of Continental steel and may stimulate exports.Production in Scotland, both of crude and finished steel, is fully up to the level of a year ago and is likely to be maintained.      There is also more activity in shipbuilding and in engineering.      Export business is better both with the Continent and with Australia,  China and India.      On the North-East coast works are well employed and there has been some expansion of orders.      Rail makers are busy and structural engineers have booked good contracts both at home and abroad. There was a decline in shipments of pig-iron from the Tees, but steel exports to Russia, Denmark and Iraq showed an increase. In Sheffield all branches remain well employed;    the motor car trade provides good orders.      In South Wales the dull conditions of January continued, but the heavy steel section has benefited a little from the improvement in shipbuilding and constructional engineering.      Lack of export orders caused a decline in the tin-plate and galvanized sheet trades, but the former has since recovered somewhat. v-MOTOR INDUSTRY.      Exports of private cars in February amounted to 4,358 (valued at  532,752) as against 3,404 (valued at  4 77,536) in February,  1934.      Exports of commercial vehicles declined,  however,  from 216 (valued at  52,525) in February,  1934. to 166 (valued at  4 7,055) in February, 1935.-3-
ij Z. &apos;0Motor vehicles newly registered in January amounted to 33,696, an increase of 6,367 (23D3$) over a year ago. The increase comprised 5,937 private cars and   4 30 other vehicles,,LIGHT METAL INDUSTRIES,      The non-ferrous metal mills are fairly active,,      Copper prices have remained steady and tin, though somewhat lower,  is still firmly heldo     Lead and spelter prices are low with a steady demand,,Conditions in the cutlery and silverware trades have improved, hut plated hollow-ware remains dull,,      All branches of the tool and machine knife industry are well employed and the position in the needle,  fishing tackle,  the lock and allied trades, and metal smallware trades is satisfactory.      Enamelled hollow-ware has been increasingly active and press work is busy. In the foundry industry average production is maintained, but conditions are not quite so satisfactory as a few months ago,ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.      During February 1,478 m. units of electricity were produced as compared with 1,343 me last year,     The index of orders received for heavy plant was 117 as compared with 112 in January and 61 in February,  1934. Orders for light material have been well maintained, partly owing to Jubilee preparations.WOOL*      There was some improvement in certain woollen districts, but activity in the worsted section as a whole declined,.     The census of machinery activity taken in the week ended February 2nd showed a decrease of 1Bb% as compared with three months ago and of 2.6^ as compared with a year ago.      There was an increase in the exports of tops in February as compared with the previous month, but a slight decrease in the export of yarns and tissues,,      Raw wool prices showed little change during the month.      Orders,  both on home and export account, continue to be scarce and the immediate outlook offers little expectation of any material and sustained improvement.
COTTON.    The improvement in production and employment in January was not generally maintained in February and average weekly deliveries of raw cotton to spinners fell from 27.45 m. lbs. to  25.57 m.  lbs.    On balance the prices of the principal classes of cotton showed little change during the month.Owing to decreased activity there was some tendency forspinners&apos; margins to be reduced.    Exports of cotton yarns and manufactures, though smaller than in January,  showed an increase over February,   1934.    Compared with a year ago there was asubstantial increase in exports of yarn to British countries andto Germany but a heavy fall in shipments to Roumania..   Exports ofpiece goods at 174.3 m.  square yards showed a decrease overJanuary (187.3 m.  square yards)  but an increase over February ayear ago (168.2 m. square yards).    Exports to India declined in -February, though they remained considerably above thecorresponding figures for February,   1934.    Exports to BritishV/est Africa, Ceylon and Hong Kong showed an increase over Januarybut were lower to the Dominions generally and to the British west indies.    On the Continent trade with Scandinavia, Greece and turkey showed an improvement over January,   out there was a declinein the case of Germany, Holland,  Roumania and Switzerland.    InSouth and Central America shipments to Argentina declined, butthere was some improvement in the case of Cuba and Venezuela.SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.    The demand for rayon yarns issteady and shows considerable improvement on the position a yearago.    This improvement is expected to continue,  though the demand from the stocking trade remains poor.    Yarn exports in January and february show considerable improvement over last year.    Thedemand for rayon piece goods is active so far as the home marketis concerned with the improved purchasing power of the public.Competition is severe,  however,  owing to the excess of productivecapacity.    Exports during January and February showed aconsiderable decrease,  possibly because overseas buyers wereanticipating their requirements during the latter half of 1934
when the export rebates were still obtainable.    Trade in real silk piece goods continues to be affected in many lines by Japanese competition.CHEMICALS..    Deliveries of alkalies were well above  those for February 1954 and deliveries of chlorine products and acids were maintained.    Sales of dyestuffs for January and February show a slight improvement upon the 1934 figures and sales of intermediates and organic chemicals were also maintained.    In the coal tar products ma rice t creosote oil is in heavy demand and business in tar spirits has improved.SOAP,  OILS AND KINDRED INDUSTRIES.      Sales of soap were still affected by the disturbance due to the price reduction during January.    Total sales of margarine for January and February show a small decline as compared with a year ago.    The improved demand for edible oils and fats noted in January was maintained and prices have risen some 5 per cent.    There was a further slight increase in February in raw material production.PAPER.    Trading conditions remain rather better than a year ago,  except in wrapping papers, and the mills are comparatively well employed.    Prices, however, continue to be depressed.    The export trade in February showed a definite increase in practically all grades,  a welcome feature being an increase in the export of newsprint to Australia.    Imports showed a decrease over February,  1934,  mainly owing to the reduced import of newsprint from Newfoundland and Canada and of strawboard from Holland.RETAIL TRADE.    The money value of retail sales  in January was 4.2$ greater than in January,  1.934.    The principal increases were in boots and shoes (9,2$),  sports and travel goods (7.8$) and men&apos;s and boys&apos; wear (7,2$).    There were small decreases in piece-goods and hardware.    Every area showed an increase in sales of merchandise other than food and. every area,   except London (West End),  in food.    Preliminary figures suggest that, there has been a further increase in retail sales during February.
CO-OPERATIVE TRADE.      The Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s sales for the four weeks to 9th February,  1935,  showed an increase of 9.2% as compared with the same period of last year. The weighted average of the wholesale prices of seven of the principal commodities showed an increase of 0.77$ as compared with a year ago, and the weighted average of the retail prices of the same commodities has increased by 1.78$.The sales of the Scottish Go-operative Wholesale Society for the first 15 weeks of their&apos; current half year showed an increase of 8% over the corresponding period of 1934. EMPIRE.CANADIAN TRADE.    Business operations in January showed expansion over December,  the index being 96.5 compared with 92.4 The index of wholesale prices moved from 71.2 to 71.5.    Exports of nickel and zinc showed marked gains.    Most food industries were less active.    Newsprint production declined from its recent record levels,  but was higher than in January,   1934. Exports of plank and boards were practically maintained.    Iron and. steel output was well maintained,  while the production of motor vehicles showed a more than seasonal increase.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.    The number of bales of wool&apos;received into store between 1st July to 51st    January was 2.47 m. as against 2.34 m.  a year ago.    Of these-1.4 m. have been disposed of as against 1.84 m.  a year earlier.    Wheat and flour shipments since December 1st are equivalent to 26.8 m.  Dushels of wheat. Exports of butter (lst July to 23rd February)  amounted to 85,000 tons as against 74,000 tons in the same period last ye,ar. The total imports of merchandise in January were  7.99 m. (Australian currency) against  6.59 m.  a year ago.
