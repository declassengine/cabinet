CP.  7b (5b) .CABINT.COPY NO.    iffCOMMITTEE ON RIBBON DEVELOPMENT.second REPORT.1.    At their Meeting on Wednesday, 3rd April, 1935,  (Cabinet 19 (35) Conclusion 11) the Cabinet decided that certain points which had been raised on the Restriction of Ribbon Development Bill (see H.A.  9 (35)  and. H.A.C.  4th Conclusions (35))  should be considered by the Ribbon Development Committee.      The Committee considered five points which had been reserved by the Home Affairs Committee for the final decision of the Cabinet, and they now submit to the Cabinet the following recommendations thereon. Local Inquiries.2.    On page 3 of his Memorandum of the 29th March,  1935,   (K.A.  9 (35)) covering the draft Restriction of Ribbon Development Bill, the Minister of .Transport raised the question whether the requirement of a local inquiry before the exercise of his proposed default powers for Standard Width restrictions should apply in the case of all roads or whether in the case of Class II roads and unclassified roads only. The Minister of Transport explained that he was prepared to agree to the representations of certain Highway Authority Associations that a public inquiry should be held in all cases before the Ministers&apos;s default powers were exercised in as much as the adoption of any standard width might involve a Highway Authority in claims for compensation. .vAfter considering this question, the Committee agreed to recommendRetrospective Effect of Clause 2.3.    On page 4 of his Memorandum (H.A.  9 (35)) the Minister of Transport raised the question whether retrospective effect should be given to Clause 2 of the draft Bill,   relating to Amenity Building Lines,That the requirement of a local inquiry should apply in all cases, and. that accordingly the words in brackets in lines 22-23 of page 3 of the draft Bill should be deleted.
9 rs rrby the insertion of a date such as the 1st April,  1935, as the date on.which the automatic restrictions within the Amenity Building Lines should come into force in the case of classified roads.The Committee considered that as, until the Bill became law, there would be no authority with power to give or withhold consent or to pay compensation, the proposal to give retrospective effect to Clause 2 was impract impracticable.The Committee agreed to recommendThat the proposal to give retrospective effect to Clause 2 was impracticable,  and that the alternative course proposed by the Minister of Transport to provide for an appointed day from which the restrictions would come into force should be adoptee..Application to the Administrative County of London. 4.      On page 9 of his Memorandum (K.A.  9  (35))  the Minister of Transport explained that the proposals of the Bill were originally not intended to apply in the special case of the administrative County of London, but as a result of informal discussions the London County Council have suggested that certain Clauses of the Bill, with suitable modification, could with advantage be extended to the administrative County.It was agreed to recommends-That a power should be included in the draft Bill to apply its general provisions to individual roads? in the administrative County of London.Agricultural Development.5.      The attention of the Committee was drawn by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to. the hardship which might be entailed in agricultural districts by the rigid application of the provisions of the draft Bill requiring that the consent of the local highway authority
*isi ushould &quot;be obtained in the case of any improvements of or extensions to existing &quot;buildings within the proposed Standard Widths;.     The Minister explained that his apprehensions related to the case of the proposed improvements both of agricultural dwelling houses as well as of purely agricultural buildings for housing stock, etc. In the former case the effect might be substantially to retard the improvement of rural cottages, in itself a very desi fab 1 e ob j ect.It was pointed out that whilst the criticism which had been raised applied particularly in the case of developments on agricultural property in view of the wide area of agricultural land included within the scope of the Bill,  it also applied, to buildings of all types within the proposed Standard Widths.      It was considered that, as the object of the Bill was to prevent ribbon development, there was a clear distinction between the improvement of a building already erected and the erection of new buildings.      The local authorities should have full powers to prevent and control the latterj    but it would not be regarded as reasonable that owners of existing houses should be prevented frsm improving them or subjected to cumbrous procedure or unreasonable conditions in securing consent    to such improvements.      It was  suggested that the provision might possibly take the form of a further extension of the proviso to Clause 7  (1)  of the Bill relating to means of access required for agricultural purpose s.The Committee agreed-That it was desirable to insert in the draft Bill a provision securing that the consent of the local highway authority should, not be withheld, or made subject to conditions  in the case of improvements to or extensions of existing buildings\    and that the Minister of Transport and the Parliamentary Draftsman should, in consultation with the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and. the Chief Valuer, Board, of Inland Revenue,  consider how the draft Bill could best be amended to give effect to this decision.
vf c*i rjCompensation in the.....case of New Roads.6.      The Committee considered that the arrangement proposed in Clause 9 (S) of the draft Bill, under which ne compensation would be payable in respect of injurious affection to land adjacent to a new road, was likely to inflict undue hardship on the owners of such property. It was felt that owners might in such a case be deprived of any value which the land might have in excess of its agricultural value, prior to the construction of the new road, e.g. by reason of the existence of other roads to watch the property in question might have access.It was thought that whilst it was reasonable to provide that no compensation should be payable in respect of restriction of access to the new road,  it would impose undue hardship if. no compensation were payable in respect 9f restrictions on building on the land adjacent to the new road.      On the other hand, the provision in Clause 9 (b) would ensure that the arbitrator in making his award would take into account any benefit which may accrue to a claimant by reason of the construction or improvement of the new road.It was agreed-That Clause 9 (2)   should, be modified by the insertion of the words &quot;as to access&quot; after the word, &quot;restrictions&quot; in line 39 of page 9 of the draft Bill.Summary of Conclusions.7.      It  is accordingly recommended that the following modifications should be made in the draft RestricticnvofRibbon Development; Bill submitted to the Cabinet undercover of the Minister of Transport&apos;s Memorandum of the29th March,  1935,   (H.A.  9  (35)).;)(1) That the requirement of a local inquiry should apply in all cases, and that accordingly the words in brackets in lines 22-23 of page 3 of the draft Bill should be deleted..
(2) That the proposal to give retrospective effect to Clause 2 was impracticable, and that the alternative course proposed by the Minister of Transport to provide for an Appointed Pay from which the restriction would come into &quot;force should be adopted.(3) That a power should be included in the draft Bill tc apply its general provisions to individual roads in the administrative County of London.(4) That it was desirable to insert in the draft Bill a prevision securing that the consent of the local highway authority should not be withheld or made subject to conditions in the case cf improvements to, or extensions of, existing buildings;    and that the Minister of Transport and the Parliamentary Draftsman should, in consultation with the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Chief Valuer, Board of Inland Revenue, consider how the draft Bill could best be amended, to give effect to this decision.(5) That Clause 9 (2)  should be modified by the insertion of the words &quot;as to access&apos;1&apos; after the word &quot;restrictions&quot; in line 39 of page 9 of the draft Bill./ The Chancellor of the Exchequer was not present at the whole of the Meeting of the Committee at which it was agreed to make the above recommendations to the Cabinet /.Signed on behalf of the Committee P.
