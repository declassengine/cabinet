DRAFT ADDRESS FROM THE HOUSE OF LORDS.Most Gracious MajestyWe Your Majesty&apos;s dutiful and loyal subjects,  the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, beg leave to    offer to Your Majesty our most heartfelt congrat-regulations on the  completion of the twenty-fifth year of Your reign.      With every one    of Your Majesty&apos;s subjects, whether within the United Kingdom or in the most distant corners of Your Majestyfs dominions, we give thanks to Almighty God for the blessing and protection bestowed upon Your Majesty during these five and twenty years    and we pray that for many years to come Your Majesty may continue to rule over us in health and strength and happiness.This City of Westminster,  this Hall wherein we meet, tell the story of the growth through centuries of civil liberty ana the rule of law,  of that ordered freedom which is the pride and heritage of our race.      In comparison with these long centuries twenty-five years may seem but a short span of time. They have been years of struggle and anxiety as well as of resolute achievement.      Into them have been crowded the fierce ordeal, of the most  desolating war in.history, the toil of rebuilding the shaken structure of our common life,  the slow and arduous endeavour to regain prosperity and to establish peace. Elsewhere Thrones and Constitutions have failed to outlast the strain.      Yet in this Realm the development of public rights and liberties has not been arrested but   has been made wider and more sure.      More truly than any of Your illustrious an-cestors Your Majesty rules over a Nation of free citizens. Yet in spite of,  nay rather because of,  this wide  extension of government by the people,  the Throne stands more firmly than ever before as the centre of the national life.Beyond the seas there have been other, perhaps even greater,  changes.      During Your Majesty&apos;s reign free-1-
institutions have sprung into being and have flourished through out Your Empire and in Your Parliament of Westminster Your Majesty has marked the growth of Your self-governing Dominions by the declaration of their authentic place in that association which we know as the British Commonwealth of Nations,,Your Majestyfs own personality has made the Throne not merely a symbol but a loved and living reality,      Por in the Sovereign Your subjects have discerned a man who by simply being himself has commanded their respect and appealed to their hearts.      In time of war the standard-bearer of the national spirit,  in the anxious years which followed a counsellor wise and steadfast,   seeking not Your own but ever mindful of the needs and cares of all Your people, avoiding no hardship and shrinking from no sacrifice, Your Majesty has called forth a loyalty and love which have given a new meaning to the name of King.We venture also to offer our loyal homage and respectful congratulations to Our Gracious Queen who has shared with Your Majesty the toils and triumphs of these five and twenty years.      By her unfailing interest in the lives and homes of the people Her Majesty has won a place of Her own in their affection.      When we  see gathered round Your Majesties Your sons,  always and in every part of the world active in the public service, we have a sure confidence that, when this generation has passed and the bright pageantry of this week has become a distant memory,  the House of Windsor will stilla;reign over a loyal and united people. .v. In no formal manner but from the depth of our hearts we pray   God bless Your Majesty.
I. We5 Your Majesty&apos;s faithful Commons&quot;, desire tooffer our humble congratulations on the completion of twenty-five years of Your reign,, our assurance of our loyal devotion to Your Person and Your House, and our heartfelt gratitude for what You have done for Your country ana Your people II. On Your Majesty&apos;s accession to the Throne weventured to use these words - that we&apos;were convinced &quot;that Your reign,, under the favour of Divine Providence , would be distinguished by unswerving efforts to promote the virtue, prosperity and contentment of the realm and to guard the rights and liberties of Your Majesty&apos;s faithful people,.&quot;    That hope has been abundantly fulfilled. Ill, Our Constitution has proved itself strong enoughto withstand the shock of a great war, and flexible enough to adapt itself to the changing circumstances of the Empire and the world.    It has given the nation stability when elsewhere foundations were crumbling.    While retaining its historic features, it has1 been broadened to give expression to  the will of the whole people on an extended franchises and under it Your Majesty&apos;s Governments have been able, without breach of continuity,, to undertake new responsiblities on behalf of the public weal. IV. Your Majesty&apos;s reign has seen profound changesin world conditions,, and the consequent emergence of complex and unfamiliar problems. We may humbly claim that our historic forms of government have proved them-selves adequate to meet each crisis as it arose. Our traditional polity has varied its methods in order to preserve its essentials, Britain remains, as ever,, a free and a well-ordered nation.
Vo These years record a continuous process ofdevelopment in the Empire of which Your Majesty is Sovereign. The Colonies have grown in economic and political stature. We have now before us constitutional proposals designed widely to extend the measure of self-Government inaugurated in India fourteen years ago.    Statutory recognition has been given by parliament to the new structure of our partnership with the Dominions as free,, equal and autonomous States united by a common allegiance to the Crown. VI. Your Majesty&apos;s high office has been enriched bythe personality of Him who holds it.    You have shared in the nation&apos;s trials and triumphs? You have sorrowed and rejoiced with Your people?    Your wisdom and fortitude have steadied the national temper?    with the gracious aid of the Queen, You have won by Your sympathy and kindliness something warmer than allegiance and profounder than loyalty. To-day You are more than Sovereign? You are Head of the Familys  and of a Nation and an Empire You have made a Household.VII. Twenty-five years ago You defined the tasks ofa Sovereign as &quot;the safeguarding of the treasures of the past&quot; and &quot;the preparing of the path of the future.&quot; Your Majesty has nobly fulfilled both duties.    We look back with grateful hearts upon the past, and with confidence we await the future.    We offer You,,  with deep respect and affection,  the homage of a free Parliament,,  and we pray that, by the blessing of Almighty God, You will long continue to be the Sovereign of a proud and devoted people.
