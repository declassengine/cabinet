March&apos; 1935.SECRET.Copy No.CP. 62 (35).CABINET.MIGRATION TO AUSTRALIA.Proposed Discussion with Mr. Lyons. (Circulated by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.)DURING his recent visit to Australia Mr. Malcolm MacDonald had some informal talk with Mr. Lyons on the subject of migration from the United Kingdom to Australia, from which it became apparent that there might be advantages in discussing the matter somewhat more formally when Mr. Lyons is in London. While it does not appear that Mr. Lyons would be prepared to consider the immediate resumption of migration on any considerable scale, he may be ready to enter into arrangements for a small movement of selected categories of migrants in the reasonably near future and to discuss in general terms the lines upon which assisted migration should be conducted when circumstances permit.Accordingly, with the concurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I informed Mr. Lyons by telegram, just before his departure from Australia, that we should be ready to discuss the position with him on the basis of the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Migration Policy (Cmd. 4689).This Report, a copy of which is annexed, has been circulated, with a request for an expression of their views upon it, to the Governments of the Dominions concerned, the Australian States and Southern Rhodesia, and also to a number of voluntary organisations and individuals in this country who have been engaged, or are otherwise interested, in the practical work of migration.I do not ask my colleagues to consider the Report in any detail at this stage. In my view, it would be desirable that the Government here should, so far as possible, wait until they have some indication of the views of the other Govern-ments, without whose ciose co-operation no policy of migration from this country could be carried out. The only reply as yet received is from the New Zealand Government, who state that they are in general agreement with the views embodied in the Report.[r.t.0.
Inasmuch, however,, as the, contemplated discussion on the subject with the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth may lead to the Government being in some measure committed in respect of certain of the recommendations which involve inter-Governmental co-operation, I think that the Cabinet should take note of the Report, and especially of the recommendations on pages 73-74 numbered (2), (3), (7), (8), (9) and (10).Any proposals involving expenditure which may emerge from the discussion with Mr. Lyons would, of course, be taken up with the Treasury by&apos;the Dominions Office.The question of legislation to implement, e.g., recommendation (4) does not arise at present.(Initialled) J.

REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS OF THEINTER-DEPARTMENTAL   COMMITTEE   ON MIGRATION   policy. INTRODUCTORY.1. We were appointed for the purpose of making recommenda-tions, in the light of past experience, as to the extent and manner in which, if at all, the United Kingdom Government should in future encourage and assist migration from the United Kingdom to the oversea parts of the British Empire. Our terms of reference are confined to recommending action by the United Kingdom Government. In so far, however, as such action must necessarily be conditioned by (&apos;&amp;) the extent to which migration within the Empire, or to countries outside the Empire, takes place without any intervention by Governments or by other agencies, (b) the views and policies of the Governments of the oversea parts of the Empire, and (c) the available machinery, whether State-con-trolled, State-aided or independent, through which migration takes place or might take place, it has been necessary for us to survey, in greater or less detail, the whole field of migration.2. As a background to such a survey, it is well to bear in mind that large scale assistance to migration provided by the United Kingdom Government dates only from 1919. It is true that certain small schemes* for assisting migration and settlement were pro-vided by the Government and by private corporations before that date, but these accounted for only a very small proportion of the total volume of migration. Generally speaking, the large move-ments of migrants from the United Kingdom which took place before the War occurred without any financial assistance from the United Kingdom Government. The Government endeavoured to ensure that authentic information should be available for all intend-ing migrants, whilst a number of voluntary organisations interested themselves in smoothing away difficulties for those persons who had made up their minds to settle overseas. The migrant went overseas as an independent individual, sometimes at the invitation of friends or relatives, sometimes to take advantage of a definite* E.g., the 1820 Settlers in South Africa, the New Zealand Colonisation Company in New Zealand, the Selkirk Scheme in Canada, etc.

The process was in fact a process of what may be called infiltration by individuals into the life of developed or developing communities overseas, as, where and when there were actual openings for newcomers.3. The number* of British subjects who proceeded overseas from the United Kingdom, including passengers direct from what is now the Irish Free State, to other parts of the Empire, during the ten years 1900-1909, when no financial assistance was being provided by the United Kingdom Government, was 1,297,217, or on the average approximately 130,000 per annum. The move-ment reached its peak in the four years 1910-1913, when no less than 1,217,710 persons, or on the average approximately 304.C per annum, proceeded overseas from the United Kingdom to other parts of the Empire. During the War, the movement practically came to a standstill. It was resumed after the War, and in the four years 1919 to 1922 inclusive, during which the United King-dom Government were providing, with the consent of the oversea Governments concerned, free passages for approved ex-service men and women, it amounted to 744,314 persons, or on the average approximately 186,000 per annum. Of these, 81,103 persons pro-ceeded under the Free Passage Scheme referred to at a total cost to the United Kingdom Government of  2,334,745. During the ten years subsequent to the passing of the Empire Settlement Act (1922 to 1931 inclusive), the total movement from, the United Kingdom to the various parts of the Empire overseas amounted to 1,801,924 persons, or on the average approximately 180,000 per annum, of which number 403,902 persons received financial assistance, either direct or indirect, under the Act, at a total cost to the United Kingdom Government of rather more than  6,000,000.4. In considering the figures for the period 1922 to 1931,t it must be remembered that the general economic depression began to develop during 1929. The figures of the outward movement to the Empire for the five subsequent years (including 1,759 from the Irish Free State spread over the five years) were as follows :-1929     ...      ...      .............   195,549
parts of the Empire overseas has fallen short of the inward flow to the extent of 22,858 in 1931, 33,840 in 1932, and 17,994 in 1933, although the inward flow has remained at approximately the same level throughout each of the past ten years.5. It is to be observed that the inward flow is in a different category from the outward flow of migration. In the main, the inward flow consists of officials in, the Indian and Colonial Ser-vices returning to settle in the United Kingdom on retirement, of persons travelling for business and social purposes, and of persons who, having settled previously! in the Dominions and Colonies, are retiring to the United Kingdom. That this is so is shown by the fact that, generally speaking, the age-groups of inward migrants are substantially higher than those of outward migrants, and that a substantially higher proportion of inward migrants travel first or second class. Prom the point of view of the economic interest of the United Kingdom, therefore, it would seem to follow that it is the outward figures rather than the net figures that are of importance.6. Having taken into account as far as possible the past facts relating to migration from the United Kingdom to the oversea parts of the Empire and such considerations, political, economic, and others, as appear to us to be relevant, the following are the main questions to which we have addressed ourselves :I. What are the objects which a policy of State-aided migra-tion is designed to achieve? In other words, is such migration within the Empire desirable, and, if so, why? (Paragraphs 13-29.)II. If State-aided migration is desirable, under what condi-tions can it take place?   i(Paragraphs 30-45.)III. What forms of migration are possible and to be encouraged, and what Government assistance, if any, should be given to these forms of migration?   (Paragraphs 46-129.)IV. What, if any, are the functions and responsibilities of voluntary organisations in relation to a policy of State-aided migration, and what assistance should be given to such organisations by the Government?    (Paragraphs 130-143.)V. What arrangements, if any, should be made for after-care, training, publicity, &amp;c. ?   (Paragraphs 144-170.)VI. What kind of machinery, central and local, is required for the formulation and administration of a policy of State-aided migration?   (Paragraphs 171-182.)7. Throughout this report we have for practical reasons confined our attention, except where otherwise stated, to the three Dominions which have offered the greatest scope for the immigra-tion of United Kingdom migrants, viz., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.   We have not dealt with the question of migration
to the Colonies. We agree generally with the views expressed on that subject by the Committee on Empire Migration of the Economic Advisory Council.* In our opinion, apart from persons with capital, and those who go out in order to take up definite appointments in the Civil Service, in business, in the professions or in agriculture, all of whom will proceed on their own resources, migration to the Colonies would not, even under the most favour-able conditions, be other than negligible as a factor in promoting the redistribution of the white population of the Empire. In these circumstances, we think that any scheme for assisted migration to the Colonies should be considered on its merits, as and when it arises.8. Before we proceed to consider the questions enumerated in paragraph 6, there are certain general observations which we should wish to make. We are confident that the conditions which have in the past led to the peopling of the great British Dominions overseas with many hundreds of thousands of migrants from the United Kingdom will recur, although perhaps in an altered form, and we see no reason to doubt that then the volume of migration from this country will be as great as it has been in the past. We are conscious however that at first sight it may appear to some readers that our report tends to be negative, that we despair of bringing about any considerable redistribution of the white popula-tion within the Empire, and that we are content to recommend minor and unimaginative measures. We hope that a more careful study of our report will dispel any such impression.9. The whole course of our enquiry, both into the past history of migration and into the economic considerations involved, has driven us irresistibly to the conclusion that the idea that migra-tion can of itself bring about an economic recovery is a fallacy. On the contrary, migration is one of the products of such a recovery. It therefore follows that the best method of promoting migration (which we regard as a most desirable object of policy) is to endeavour to bring about the conditions such as a rising level of inter-imperial trade which will of themselves attract migra-tion, and then to see that the way is made clear and kept clear for the migration so attracted.10. It would be neither within our terms of reference nor within our competence to have attempted to make any recommendations on such matters as the increase of inter-imperial trade, and our posi-tive recommendations, therefore, as a result of the premise stated above, have been confined to advocating what seem to us to be the best methods of facilitating and encouraging that spontaneous migration which alone, in our opinion, is likely to yield successful results.* Cmd. 4075, paragraph 176.
11. But we have also necessarily had to examine, and have found ourselves unable to-recommend, a number of proposals which are now prominently before the public but appear to us to be based on the fallacy mentioned in paragraph 9. Almost inevitably this examination&apos; has occupied a considerable space, and may there-fore appear to have given a predominatingly negative colour to our report. If these proposals are considered, however, it will be seen that, even if they were successful, they would produce, at a very heavy expense, no more than a very thin stream of migration at the most, perhaps, some 10,000 migrants a year whereas we believe that when once economic recovery begins, there is no reason why, if all unnecessary obstacles are cleared away, as we recommend that they should be, the number of migrants from the United Kingdom to the oversea parts of the Empire, should not once again reach a figure of from 150,000 to 250,000 a year, at comparatively small expense to the Governments concerned.12. Finally, it should be clearly understood that we are not attempting to lay down rules which should govern migration policy for all time. Our conclusions have necessarily been based upon economic conditions as they exist to-day or upon such fore-casts as we have ventured to make of the conditions which are likely to exist for some time to come. Prophecy, however, is fallible in economic as in other spheres. It may well be that such changes may take place in the near future as will necessitate a fundamental reconsideration of the whole question of migration. We believe that our conclusions are valid in the light of present conditions; we do not claim that they will remain so always.II. WHAT ARE THE OBJECTS OF A POLICY OF   STATE-AIDED   MIGRATION   WITHIN   THEEMPIRE.13. Three kinds of consideration are involved, political, social and economic. Before dealing with these considerations, how-ever, we think it desirable to point out that throughout our report we assume that the policy of granting financial assistance from the Exchequer towards, the cost of migration is justified, if at all, not on the ground that it &quot;will benefit any particular individual, but rather that it will be of advantage to the British Commonwealth as a whole. *Political considerations.14. It is, wo think, unnecessary to state at any length the im-portanoe which is attached, not only in this country but throughout the  oversea   Dominions,   to   the   continual   development   and
strengthening, along the lines enunciated in the Report of the Im-perial Conference of 1926, of the British Commonwealth of Nations in which the United Kingdom and the Dominions are associated as free and equal partners. If it be granted that this political develop-ment should be encouraged by all available means, it follows that it is desirable that the Dominions should be peopled, as far as possible, with those who have been brought up in the ideas and are likely to cherish the beliefs on which it is founded.15. From the point of view of the defence of the people and territories of the various parts of the Commonwealth, the im-portance of adequate populations in the Dominions is manifest.Social and Economic considerations.16. It is in general difficult to disentangle the social and economic effects of a migration policy, and we propose to deal with these two considerations jointly. In this connection we desire to draw atten-tion to the Report of the Committee on Empire Migration of the Economic Advisory Council, dated 11th July, 1931 (Cmd. 4075), which reviewed these questions at considerable length. In general we accept their views under these headings as expressed in Part I of their report, and we do not propose to cover this ground again in the same detail, but in setting out this part of our report we are unable to avoid a certain amount of overlapping. We propose to deal with the social and economic considerations of a migration policy from the following aspects (i) that of the individual migrant;(ii) that of the community to which he goes; and(hi) that of the community which he leaves.The interest of the individual.17. Generally speaking the fundamental inducement to the individual to migrate consists in the expectation that he or at any rate his children will be able in the country of settlement to obtain a higher standard of living, or to secure employment or occupation of a more congenial or permanent character than he can obtain in the country which he is leaving,, or, doubtless in the majority of cases, a combination of all these prospects. It is idle to imagine that this inducement is as potent as it was in the past. Not only is there a greater knowledge of the hardships and differences in social customs and habits entailed even in successful migration, but the standard of living in this country has markedly improved, and the agricultural section of the population, which before the war furnished a substantial proportion of the total number of migrants, has appreciably decreased.
The interest of the Community to which Migration takes place.18. The advantage of migration to the receiving country consists in the acquisition of a number of individuals, at the beginning or in the early part of the productive period of their lives, on whom it has spent nothing during their non-productive childhood and adolescence. The mere fact that these individuals have made up their minds to undertake the adventure of migration is in itself an indication that they possess at least some of the qualities which make for good citizenship. Moreover, so far as the *Dominions are concerned, taking a long view there can be no doubt that, apart from any political considerations, they require additional popula-tion for economic development and for the provision of &apos;&apos; the diversified types which are requisite for the efficient organisation of modern civilised communities.&quot;!19. From the purely economic standpoint it must be the hope cf the receiving country that these migrants, by producing^ more than enough to maintain themselves and their dependants, will increase the economic stability and help to raise the standard of living of then new country. Further, it is worth observing that capital expenditure on certain public services, in some parts of the Dominions at any rate, has been such as to provide for a substantially larger population than actually exists at present, so that in those localities an increase in population within limits would require a relatively moderate additional capital outlay on such ser-vices, and should reduce the burden of the capital indebtedness per head of the population.20. On the other hand, it is necessary that the increase of popula-tion in the Dominions should not be effected so rapidly as to outrun* The following figures show the disparity between the density of the white population in the United Kingdom and the Dominions with which we are mainly concerned in this report:  Population, per square mile of &quot; habitable &quot; area.England and Wales............... 678Great Britain and N. Ireland    ...      ...      ... 483England, Wales  and Scotland   ...       ...      ... 410Canada ...      ...      ...       ...       ...       ... 7-25Australia        ...       ...      ...       ...       ...      ... 3-75New Zealand ...............       ... 16-8It is, however, to be observed that the &quot; habitable &quot; area of the Dominions does not necessarily mean an area suitable for close settlement. Of the &quot;habitable &quot; area of Australia, for instance, it has been calculated that not more than one-quarter is at present suitable for close settlement. (Griffith Taylor.   Studies in Australian Affairs, p. 26.)t (Cmd. 4075, paragraph 69.) t; Throughout this report production, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, means effective production, i.e., production which passes into con-sumption, and gives a fair return to the producer. Mere production, for which there is no readily available market, may well, as recent events have shown, be a source of economic weakness rather than economic strength.
their absorptive capacity. There is a definite, though fluctuating,* limit to the rate at which any given country can absorb new settlers, and settlement in excess of that limit is likely to be detri-mental to the settlers themselves and to the community in which such settlement takes place. Thus, although it is evident that Canada and Australia, for example, are capable in the future of carrying a population considerably greater than they have at pre-sent, it is not possible, having regard to the uncertainties of general world conditions, to make any confident prediction as to the absorptive capacity of the Dominions during the next few years.The interest of the Community from which Migration takes place,21. The interest of the community from which the migrant goe; (i.e., for the purpose of this report the United Kingdom) consist in the hope (i) of converting non-producers in the United Kingdom int producers overseas,(ii) of converting less effective producers in the Unite Kingdom into more effective producers overseas,(iii) of creating, as a result of migration, vacancies for non producers to become producers in the United Kingdom,tand thereby at the same time reducing the non-productive over head in this country, and increasing the purchasing power of som of our most important oversea markets to an extent which out weighs any consequential decrease in the purchasing power o our home markets.22. On the other hand, there are certain considerations in th contrary sense which must be mentioned. The country of origin has incurred substantial expenditure, through the State and throng* In the case of Australia, the anmial average rate of increase of ne population over a period of 64 years, from 1860, was slightly in excess of 2 per cent. This figuTe comprises an average rate of natural increase of Vi per cent., and an average rate of immigration of -55 per cent. The anna average rate of increase in the three Dominions of Canada, Australia an New Zealand during the decade ending 1921 was 2 per cent. (0. Wickens, Economic Record, November, 1925.) (In the case of Australi according to returns issued by the Commonwealth Government, the average annual rate of increase for the decade ending 1932 was 1-38 per cent., wM the rate for 1933 was -79 per cent.)It is interesting to observe that the average annual increase in the Unit States of America, a country which has always been regarded as showing more rapid rate of increase than any other, was no more than 1-85 per cen in the period from 1880 to 1920, the year preceding the introduction of t quota system.For detailed figures see Appendix III.t It should, however, he borne in mind that the migration of certain type of skilled men may create vacancies which cannot readily be filled and ffl thus cause&apos; a curtailment of production. Moreover, if the migrants are I men, upon whose work the activities of semi-skilled and unskilled men a dependent, their departure may acttially create temporary unemployment,
the parents, on the migrants in the non-productive years of them lives, and if they transfer to another country the return on this expenditure is to some degree a loss to the United Kingdom. Moreover,-migrants generally tend to possess certain qualities, e.g., health and enterprise, which are of special value to the community. The departure of such persons may be outweighed by other conse-quential advantages, but in itself there is no doubt it is a loss.Conditions of Satisfactory Settlement.23. It is important to observe that from each of the aspects mentioned in paragraphs 17 to 21, the economic advantage dis-appears unless the migration results in a definite improvement in the productive capacity or purchasing power of the individual migrant, or, at least, of the average migrant. Unless there is such an improvement there is no inducement to the individual to migrate,* and there is no increase, but rather a decrease, in the purchasing power of our home and oversea marketsl24. The above qualification affects also, though do a less degree, the political and social considerations set out in paragraphs 14 to 22. While these may not perhaps demand that the economic status of the migrant should be definitely improved as a result Of migra-tion, they do at least demand that it should not be diminished.25. In other words, migration should not be encouraged, still less should it be assisted or facilitated by the expenditure of public money, unless it is likely to result in satisfactory settlement, i.e., settlement which, within a reasonable period of time, at the worst enables the settler to produce enough to keep himself and his dependants without thereby displacing another member of the population in his country of settlement, and at the best enables him to produce such a surplus as will eventually lead to a large increase in the employment of others.26. Before leaving this part of the subject reference should be made to the conclusion of the Committee on Empire Migration of the Economic Advisory Council (July, 1931) that, while &quot;in view of our post-war economic difficulties emigration would be economically advantageous for us as an emergency policy for the next few years . . . . in view of the progressive decline in our birthrate, and the likelihood of a gradual readjustment of our industrial life to post-war conditions, it is hardly likely.that large-scale migration would be economically advantageous to us as a long-period policy.! In view of the magnitude of the fluctuations in the world economic position which have taken place since the Economic Advisory Council&apos;s Committee reported, we&apos;.venture to* In the case of the individual, it may be a sufficient consideration, as noted in paragraph 17, if there is a prospect of. an improvement in the economic and social condition of his children. .:t Cmd. 4075, paragraph 38.
doubt whether it would now be safe to assume that an industrial equipoise will be established in this country within such a period as to rule out of consideration a long-range policy of Empire Migration,27. Even if, however, it is possible to anticipate that within a few years there will be no &quot; abnormal &quot; unemployment in the United Kingdom, it seems to us that it might well continue to be the case that a substantial flow of migration from the United Kingdom to the oversea parts of the Empire would be economically advantageous both to this country and to the Empire as a whole. The movement, hardly yet begun, towards industrial and agricul-tural co-operation between the different units of the Empire, may have a far-reaching effect upon the distribution of employment and consequently of population, between the United Kingdom and the Dominions.28. Furthermore, it is to be observed that, in this part of their Report, the Committee of the Economic Advisory Council had purely economic considerations in mind. The political and social considerations referred to in paragraphs 14 to 22 would appear to be unaffected by the Committee&apos;s conclusion. In fact the Com-mittee themselves in paragraph 82 of their Report came to the conclusion that on other than strictly economic grounds it was &quot; of great importance that a steady flow of British migrants to the Dominions should be maintained.&quot;29. We may perhaps summarise the above considerations by observing that so far as the British Empire is concerned, the ques-tion of migration should be regarded not merely as one of facilitat-ing and regulating a flow of population from an over-populated United Kingdom into under-populated Dominions, but as one of re-distributing the total available population of the Empire so as to serve as closely as possible the political, social, and economic needs of each part, as well as of the whole.Ill-CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH MIGRATION CAN TAKE PLACE.30. It was stated in paragraph 25 that no expenditure of public money in assisting or facilitating migration from the United King-dom to the Dominions can be justified unless it is likely to result in satisfactory settlement; and &quot; satisfactory settlement &quot; was defined as settlement which, within a reasonable period of time, at the worst enabled the settler to produce enough to keep himself and his dependants without thereby displacing another member of the popu-lation in the country of settlement, and at the best enabled him to produce such a surplus as would eventually lead to a large increase in the employment of others. Satisfactory settlement, in fact, requires that the settler shall be profitably employed in the country of settlement.
31. The minimum requirement suggested above would be fulfilled if the settler were able to feed and clothe himself and his family, as did the Boer Voortrekker or the frontier settlers in the United States, from the produce grown by him on his own land, and, in fact, proposals have recently been put forward for community settlements on a &quot; subsistence &quot; basis i.e., settlements intended to be independent of any external market for their produce. These proposals are examined in some detail in paragraphs 86 to 92.32. In every other case, the condition laid down in paragraph 25 requires that there should be a reasonably secure and available market for a considerable proportion of the produce of the migrant&apos;s labour, and the question whether such a market exists.or can be developed is, in our opinion, the first criterion which should be applied to every scheme of migration of every kind, except to such schemes of &quot; subsistence&quot; settlement as are referred, to above, and are discussed later in this Report.33. The condition that it is essential that there should be an available market for the migrant&apos;s produce applies with as much force to the individual as to the group, and to the industrial as to the agricultural worker. Indeed it is obvious that the moment that the needs of the individual include commodities which he cannot himself produce, he must be able to sell what he can produce if he is to be able to procure what he cannot produce. And inasmuch as the newcomer in any community, either because he has to create new markets for his produce, or to compete with neighbours longer established than himself in existing markets which may already be fully supplied, is always likely to meet with difficulty, at any rate at first, in disposing of his produce, these considerations, apply with particular force to the migrant.34. In saying that there must be a reasonably secure market for the migrant&apos;s produce, we do not mean that there must necessarily be a specific existing market in which demand* for the particular commodity which the migrant produces is actually unsatisfied at the moment. In healthy conditions of trade and exchange it may well be that there is a latent demand which will become, or can be made, actual with increased production. Moreover, it must not be overlooked that the mere fact of settlement and the initial expen-diture of capital in the country of settlement will of itself tend to create the conditions in which an increased supply can be marketed ; in other words the settlers themselves contribute in some degree towards the creation of the market for their own commodities. In saying that there must be a reasonably secure market for the* Throughout this Report, demand, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, must be understood to mean effective demand, i.e., demand backed up by purchasing power.The Importance of Markets.

The condition that it is essential that there should be an available market for the migranfs produce applies with as much force to the individual as to the group, and to the industrial as to the agricultural worker. Indeed it is obvious that the moment that the needs of the individual include commodities which he cannot himself produce, he must be able to sell what he can produce if he is to be able to procure what he cannot produce.

migrants produce we mean that, making due allowance for these factors, there must be a reasonable prospect that over a period of time the world demand for the commodities which the settler pro-duces will be adequate to absorb the additional production arising from the settler&apos;s labour at a price which will enable him to cover the cost of production, and in addition to finance his living and working expenses, interest on and redemption of capital, and also his necessary &quot; imports &quot; from outside his own community.35. At the present moment, so far as agricultural production, at any rate, is concerned, this condition is not satisfied. Owing partly to the very rapid increase in production which has taken place in recent years, and partly to the decrease in purchasing power result-ing from the economic depression, not one of the main primary commodities normally produced by settlers without large capital is being sold on the markets of the world at such a price as to be reasonably remunerative to the producer, and it is clear that in present circumstances any material increase in existing supplies might, from the producers point of view, be disastrous. Indeed it is relevant to our considerations that much time and labour are now being spent in endeavours to regulate the production of various staple commodities as a means of averting the over-production of them which already exists in some cases, or threatens in others.36. It is in the light of considerations such as these that the various schemes put forward for &apos;&apos; peopling the vast open spaces of the Empire &quot; with migrants from the United Kingdom must be examined. Such migrants must, if they are to live, be able to sell what they produce in order to buy what they need. Ex hypothesi&apos; what they produce will be mainly, if not entirely, agricultural com-modities. The condition of the market for most agricultural com-modifies at the moment is, however, such that even a comparatively slight additional production might well bring the level of prices below even its present unremunerative point and thereby bring disaster to a far larger number of persons than the settlers themselves.37. For the reasons given above, we should regard the encourage-ment of any considerable scheme of migration at the present time as out of the question. Are these conditions, however, to be regarded as permanent? There is at the moment, over a wide range of commodities (both primary and secondary), an actual excess of supply over visible demand. But it can hardly be ques-tioned that there is a potential demand for almost every commodity, only waiting to be called forth by a general increase in prosperity, which could consume far larger supplies than are available. While, however, this demand, when it arises, will undoubtedly call for large additional production, and by so doing will create conditions favourable once more to migration within the Empire, it must nol be forgotten that the large actual increase in productivity per hea
which has taken place in recent years as a result of mechanisation, coupled with the large potential increase in productivity per acre which undoubtedly exists, have brought about a permanent and very important change in the economic structure of the world. Whereas in the past supply, generally speaking, has always lagged behind demand, it is now clear that it is possible so rapidly and so greatly to increase the supply of almost any commodity that there will be a constant prospect of supply overtaking demand. Not only therefore must we look for a lag, which may well last for some con-siderable period, in the recovery of migration behind the recovery from economic depression, but it may well be that increased demand, when it arises, will not rapidly create conditions so favourable to migration, particularly for settlement on the land, as were created by the steady increase in the world demand for com-modities during the latter half of the nineteenth and the early part of the twentieth century.38. Bearing these considerations in mind it would appear to follow that the United Kingdom Government can give no greater or more direct stimulus to migration than by assisting to create increased markets in this country or elsewhere for the Dominion producer, and thereby breaking the vicious circle by which low returns to the producer and low purchasing power in this country result from and are caused by one another. An increase in the capacity of the oversea parts of the Empire to absorb migrants from the United Kingdom is not the least among the effects of any measures which may be adopted in this country to increase the quantity of imports from the Dominions. It is true that the effects of any such measures may be overlaid by other factors, political and economic, operating in the opposite direction; but those effects nevertheless remain and will become apparent as soon as conditions permit. It will no doubt be wise to consider, in the meanwhile, the lines along which migration, when it revives, should be directed, and the best means of facilitating it, but it should not be forgotten that successful migration cannot be created, either in times of prosperity or the reverse, merely by providing facilities, financial or otherwise, for migrants. It is created by securing the fundamental economic conditions which will give it a prospect of success. The provision of facilities (e.g., under the Empire Settlement Act) is purely ancillary; and if and in so far as it encourages migration where the essential condition of success, namely, the existence of a market, is absent, it is definitely harmful.The need for Capital investment.39. Assuming, however, the return of what may be described as &quot;normal &quot; economic conditions, i.e., conditions in which there is a steady demand for a gradually expanding volume of production, there is a further condition to be taken into consideration, namely, &apos;he question of capital investment.
40. The Development and Migration Commission in Australia, in a Report issued in 1929, estimated that the new capital investment required to place youths of working age in employment in Australia at that time was between  500 and  1,000 per head. Since that date values have undergone considerable changes ; and we should in any case be indisposed to apply rigidly any calculation of this kind. Nevertheless, it is obviously true that any increase in population, unless it is to be accompanied by a decrease in the standard of living, demands an increase in capital investment in the country in which the increase in population takes place.41. One form of increase in capital investment arises from savings in the country concerned, and such savings should normally pro-vide for at least the natural increase of the population. Generally speaking, any increase by migration must be financed either out of increased savings due to growing prosperity, or by the investment of capital from abroad. Quite apart from the necessity for a market, already referred to., immigration can only take place where it is preceded or at least accompanied by the creation or the intro-duction of new capital.The Discovery of Gold.42. The discovery of large and easily worked deposits of gold is a special case, and the effect of such a discovery on the absorptive capacity of a country may be seen in the fact that, while the population of Australia in 1851 was only 405,000, by 1861, fol-lowing the extensive discoveries of gold which took place in the intervening 10 years, it had increased to 1,145,000. Similarly, following the discovery of gold in Western Australia, the ^population of that State rose from 58,658 in 1892 to 179,708 in 1900.* It is to be observed that the increase in absorptive capacity so created is, to a large degree, permanent, notwithstanding that the economic production of gold may be comparatively short-lived. The increase in the capital wealth of the country remains, and enables the new population, originally attracted by the mines, to settle down in other occupations, usually agriculture. The growth of a prosperous mining community is a most valuable stimulus to agricultural development, and even though in the course of time the mining industry may disappear, the agricultural development remains. It is arguable that under present conditions one of the best services which Governments could render to migration would be to subsidise scientific research with a view to the discovery of new source within the Empire of mineral wealth for which there is an available world market.The  34,000,000 Agreement.43. While, however, such discovery can be assisted, develop-ment of this kind is obviously limited to those areas in which* Sir Hal Colebatch A Story of a Hundred Years, p. 195.
212minerals exist; the alternative method of increasing the absorptive capacity of a country, namely the introduction of capital from outside, is not subject to limitation of this character. An attempt to create immigration by the introduction of capital from outside was in fact made in 1925 by the Agreement (known as the &quot;  34 million Agreement &quot;) between, the United Kingdom Government and the Commonwealth Government of Australia. Under that Agreement the United Kingdom Government agreed to make a contribution approximately equivalent to half the interest for ten vears on capital sums raised by the Commonwealth Government and expended on agreed lines by the State Governments on de-velopment works of various kinds. In return the Commonwealth and State Governments undertook to accept and settle satisfac-satisfactorily one migrant for each  75 capital so raised and expended on developments44. It is not, in our opinion, possible as yet finally to estimate the results of this attempt to hasten the rate of absorption of population in Australia. The total amount of capital raised and issued under the terms of the Agreement during the years 1925 to 1932 was  7,000,000. It is impossible to say how much of this capital would have been raised had the Agreement never been in existence, nor is it possible to ascertain the amount of capital in-introduced into Australia independently of the Agreement during the same period, but it may be mentioned that apart from the above mentioned sum, and apart from capital investment by the settlers, or from other sources, the Commonwealth and State Governments raised during this period no less than  217,690,000. The actual effect of the Agreement in creating capital investment in Australia which would not otherwise have been created was therefore com-paratively small, and it seems probable that, in so far as it did create additional capital investment, that investment (for reasons, partly economic and. partly political, which could not have been foreseen) has not as yet been productive of immigration to the extent which might reasonably have been expected. It does not, of course, follow from this that the capital invested in Australia under the &apos;&apos;  34 million Agreement &quot; is to be regarded as wasted. On the contrary, it seems to us certain that, in so far as that capital has been invested in permanent productive works, such as irrigation dams, railways, etc., it will in due course, when economic conditions permit, produce its effect in terms of migration, and will, pro tanto, obviate the necessity for fresh investment.45. In our opinion the fundamental condition for successful migra-tion is the existence of natural resources, the development of which offers the prospect of an improved standard of living to the migrants. For this development both a capital outlay and a market, actual* For a statement of the conditions and operations of the &quot;  34,000,000 Agreement&quot; see Appendix IV.
or potential, for the products are required. If the latter require-ment is fulfilled the natural resources will in general offer of them-selves remunerative openings for capital sufficient to attract what-ever investment may be necessary. Some capital outlay by public authorities may be required for public utilities and similar pur-poses, but for the rest the supply of capital through the normal channels should be relied on as a criterion of the extent and quality of the resources to be utilised. In our opinion, it. is neither neces-sary nor desirable that the inflow of capital should be artificially stimulated at the risk of inducing new production which would find no market; and if and where it is necessary that, in order to produce migration, such an artificial stimulation should be applied, that fact should, we suggest, be regarded as a warning that it ir essential to exercise great caution in the development of any scheme under such conditions.IV. FORMS OF MIGRATION.GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.46. Before examining in greater detail the various forms of rnigra-tion, it may be well to consider whether there are any general con-siderations applicable to all such forms, by which future policjr should be governed.Migration and Citizenship.47. It is, in our view, of great importance that the migrant should, from the earliest possible moment after his arrival in hi new country, regard himself as a citizen of that country, withi the rights and obligations of such citizens. It is equally desirable that the&apos;Government and people of that country should regard the migrant from the first, in practice if not in law, as a full citizea of that country, dependent upon, and responsible to, his net Government and his new fellow citizens alone for the rights: obligations of a citizen and a neighbour. We do not feel tbiat ttej general validity of this principle need be regarded as disturbed! the limited exception which we propose in paragraphs 144 to Bj in connection with the question of aftercare.48. Hitherto the tendency at any-rate of the assisted migrant-has been to look backwards to the Government of the Units Kingdom for further assistance and support, and this tendency been encouraged by the fact that, for some considerable time aft his arrival, he is apt to be regarded both by his neighbours * by the Government of his new country as belonging to a sp &quot; migrant &quot; class still dependent to some considerable degree the United Kingdom Government. Experience of the ai working of the Empire Settlement Act shows that this tendefjl has been the cause of much failure and disappointment in the pi
and we are of opinion that similar failure and disappointment in future can only be avoided if the migrant understands from the first that his country of settlement is his country, its Government his Government, and its citizens his fellow citizens.Migration and Unemployment.49. In this connection, it is worth recalling that the policy of State-aided migration embodied in the Empire Settlement Act of 1922 was initiated at a Conference between representatives of the United Kingdom Government and of the Governments of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, held in January-February, 1921*. This Conference recognised the importance of Empire Settlement as conducive not only to development and trade, but also to the stability and safety of the whole Empire, and therefore recom-mended effective co-operation between the United Kingdom and oversea Governments &quot; in a comprehensive policy of Empire land settlement and Empire directed migration.&quot; In opening the pro-ceedings of this Conference, Lord Milner emphasised the point that &quot; oversea settlement should not be regarded as a means of dealing directly with abnormal unemployment in the United King-dom at any given moment, but as a means of remedying fluctua-tions of trade by developing our best markets and of permanently minimising the risk of unemployment here and throughout the Empire.&quot; The recommendations of the Conference were adopted by the Conference of Prime Ministers of the Empire in July, 1921 (Cmd. 1474).50. Unfortunately, there has undoubtedly grown up in the Dominions in recent years a widespread belief that the United Kingdom was anxious to get rid of her unemployed by transferring them to the Dominions under the various schemes of assisted migra-tion, regardless of the capacity of the Dominions to absorb them. There is no truth in this view, so far as responsible authorities in this country are concerned. On the contrary, Lord Milner&apos;s state-ment of the position has been steadily adhered to by the United Kingdom Government in connection with the various schemes of assisted migration which have been agreed upon under the Empire Settlement Act.51. But it is easy to appreciate how the above-mentioned miscon-ception has arisen in the Dominions. Owing to the magnitude of the unemployment figures in the United Kingdom in the last decade there has been a natural tendency on the part of some who have discussed this problem in the Press, in Parliament, and elsewhere, to stress unduly the aspect of relief to unemployment which various migration schemes might hope to achieve. This was the advantage which from their point of view was the most obvious,* Cmd. 1474, Appendix V.
and the numerous references to this side of the problem were repro-duced and circulated in the Dominions. In point of fact the exist-ence of unemployment in the United Kingdom did not mean that migration to the Dominions would take place solely or even mainly from among those in this country who were out of employment, and certainly not from among those who were out of employment owinn to physical or mental disabilities; for the restrictions and selective tests applied by the Dominion Governments themselves to applicants before they were accepted by them as State aided migrants ensured a standard up to the necessarily high requirements of the Dominions, and the migrants can in general safely be presumed to possess qualities of health, intelligence and enterprise at least ss high as the average level of those of the population as a whole. We believe in fact that the State-aided migration which has taken place since the War has on balance been definitely of advantage to the Empire as a whole and not only to the United Kingdom.The necessity for co-operation between the United Kingdom andthe Dominions.52. There has been a tendency, which has grown stronger in recent years, to regard the acceptance by the Dominions of migrants as being, from the United Kingdom point of view, a duty which tie Dominions owe to the Mother Country, and from the Dominion point of view as a form of assistance which they are prepared, not without hesitation and even reluctance, to extend to the Mother Country if it can be done without detriment to themselves. Wei not believe that there is any justification for such an attitude d mind and we are certain that it is seriously detrimental to tie prospect of a successful policy of assisted migration. In our view, the Government of the United Kingdom should not afford assistance to persons to migrate overseas unless the Governments of tie Dominions express themselves as anxious to receive the migrant! and ready to join in making all the necessary arrangements to give their settlement a real prospect of success. It is important that this view should be fully appreciated both in this country ail in the Dominions.53. For this reason, among others i.e. because, if it is to bs successful, a policy of assisted migration must be regarded as a co-operative undertaking by the two communities concerned for the benefit of both, and not as an acquiescence by the immigratiij community in an operation directed solely to the relief of to emigrating community it seems to Us right that the financial burden of any assistance which it may be decided to render ft migrants should be equitably shared between the two communitiesDeportation.54. We have given some consideration to the question of deport1; tion.   It cannot, in our opinion, be regarded as unreasonable tW
a Government, notwithstanding that it may have invited and assisted migrants to settle within its borders, should reserve the right to reject those who, within a reasonable period after their arrival, show that they are unlikely under any normal conditions to become acceptable citizens. It is in the exercise of this right that difficulty and even friction may arise. The case of persons convicted of offences involving grave moral turpitude involves special considera-tions and is not relevant to our report. As regards persons who, from other than physical causes, become public charges, a migrant should in our opinion be liable to deportation only within a period of, say, three years after his arrival, and within that period deportation-tion should only take place where the settler becomes a public charge for reasons personal to himself, and not for reasons applicable to the whole community in which he has settled. In other words, it seems to us to be. reasonable that a settler who, as a result of manifest laziness or incompetence (and not merely inexperience) becomes a public charge within three years of his arrival, should be liable to deportation; but unreasonable that a settler who might otherwise have been successful should be so liable because he be-comes a public charge as a result of climatic or economic conditions which equally affect his native-born neighbours. As regards persons who become public charges from physical causes, we would suggest that where such causes arise from accident or from illness con-tracted after arrival, deportation should in no case take place except at the request of the person concerned. Where, however, the causes can definitely be attributed to illness contracted before arrival, deportation should be allowable, save in cases of exceptional hard-ship, up to 10 years from the date of arrival.55. In the preceding paragraphs of this Section we have reviewed the general considerations by which, in our opinion, future policy should be governed. We have now, assuming the existence of favourable general economic conditions, to examine in detail the various forms which migration has taken in the past or may take in the future, and to consider which of those forms should in our opinion be encouraged.UNASSISTED AND ASSISTED MIGRATION.56. Apart from certain special post-war arrangements, no financial assistance was provided by the United Kingdom Government to assist the migration movement prior to 1922, when the Empire Settlement Act was passed. Before that date all migration was &quot;unassisted &quot; migration, so far as the United Kingdom Govern-ment was concerned; any assistance that was given was provided by the Dominion Governments or philanthropic organisations. Since that date migration can be divided into two main categories :  (a) &quot; unassisted &quot;, i.e. in which the migrant has received no financial assistance from the United Kingdom Government direct or indirect; and
(b) &quot; assisted &quot;, in which the migrant has received direct or indirect financial assistance from the United Kingdom Government in co-operation with the Dominion Governments and/or some other organisation.57. Of these two categories, the &apos;&quot; unassisted &quot; has been the more important. Thus, in the period 1922 to 1931 the total number of migrants from the United Kingdom to the oversea parts of the Empire was 1,070,227, of whom 666,325 proceeded without anj Government assistance whatever, leaving a balance of 403,902 who received assistance in one form or another. It is clear, therefore, that in spite of the facilities available under the Empire Settlement Act, the number of persons who migrated &quot; on their own &quot; was the major factor in the total volume of migration.*Unassisted Migration.58. It will probably be generally admitted that unassisted migra-tion is the best of all forms of migration. It is the natural outcome of the economic conditions most favourable to sound migration, foi the migrant is attracted by the likelihood of a steady and remunera-tive demand for such commodities or services as he proposes to produce or render, and it fulfils in the fullest sense the criterion which, as the preceding paragraphs will have suggested, should be applied to all forms of migration, namely, that migration should be a process of pulling rather than pushing that the stimulus to the migrant should be the favourable conditions to which he is going rather than the less favourable conditions which he is leaving.59. This form of migration, being independent of any direci assistance from Governments, lies outside the scope of our terms of reference. As has already been pointed out, however (see paragraph 38), the United Kingdom Government can probabl; render no greater or more beneficial assistance to sound migration than by assisting to create, maintain and increase markets, whethei in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, for Empire products, andil is unassisted migration which is most stimulated by this means.Assisted Migration.60. Direct financial assistance to migrants has hitherto been made available under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, mainly ii three forms, viz. : (a) by a joint grant from the United Kingdom Government and the Dominion Government concerned and/or some otha organisation so that a fare appreciably below the normal rat* Apart from the 1,070,227 British subjects who migrated within tin Empire in the period 1922 to 1931, 383,215 British subjects emigrated witl out any Government assistance from the United Kingdom to foreigi countries.
becomes available to persons within certain categories approved by the Dominion Governments Particulars of these rates are shown in Appendix V.(6) by advances, within certain limits, made jointly by the United Kingdom Government and the Dominion Government concerned, and/or some other organisation, to persons approved by the Dominion Government, for the purpose of providing them with (i) a loan in respect of their passage money and the incidental expenses of their migration; and, under certain schemes,(ii) an advance of capital in order to enable them to settle on the land on arrival overseas.61. In addition, indirect assistance has been afforded jointly by the United Kingdom and Dominion Governments and/or some other organisation, under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, as follows, viz. : (a) by the provision of finance for the purpose of develop-ment with a view to affording opportunities for new migrants (see paragraph 43 and Appendix IV regarding the  34,000,000 Agreement with the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia);(6) by the provision of training facilities in the United Kingdom or overseas for actual or intending migrants (see paragraphs 152 to 161 on training);(c) by the provision of aftercare after arrival overseas (see paragraphs 144 to 151).Expenditure under the Empire Settlement Act.62. The total cost to the United Kingdom Government during the period 1922 to 1933 of the various forms of assistance referred to in the two preceding paragraphs was upwards of  6,000,000, made up as follows, viz. : (i) All assisted migrants, i.e., 404,729 persons, received the benefit of a grant towards the cost of the ocean fare either directly, or indirectly in the special case of the  10 rate to Canada.   The total cost was  3,304,950.(ii) A proportion of these migrants received advances towards their fares, etc., amounting to  546,113. Seventy-two per cent, of these advances has been recovered in actual* There was an exception to the latter condition in the case of the  10 rate to Canada, which was provided by means of a joint contribution by the United Kingdom Government and the Steamship Lines, and was available for all bona fide migrants from the United Kingdom to Canada. The Canadian Government concurred in the arrangement generally and did not require that each individual migrant should be approved, but made no financial contribution.
cash, nine per cent, has been written off, and the amount still outstanding is  107,000, or less than twenty per cent., of which a considerable proportion may have to be written off.(hi) 3,9&apos;30 assisted migrants, heads of families, have received advances from the United Kingdom Government foi land settlement. These advances amounted in ail to  886,402. It is too early yet to form any final idea of the proportion of these advances which is likely to be repaid, but there is no doubt that the losses will be heavy. In the case of the 3,000 Families Scheme in Canada, for instance, it has been found necessary to write down the outstanding advances as at the end of October, 1929, by 30 per cent., and the position of many of the settlers has deteriorated further since that^date. In Australia, advances to migrants for land settlement were financed in the first instance by the State Governments, who in their turn received contributions from the Commonwealth and United Kingdom Governments, under the &quot;  34 million Agreement &quot;. During the period of the Agreement, 3,970 assisted migrants, heads of families, repre-senting 14,619 persons, took part in land settlement schemes in Australia.(iv) A sum of  1,436,005 has been contributed by the United Kingdom Government between 1925 and the present date towards schemes under the &quot;  34 million Agreement &quot;.(v) Training has been provided for 1,273 single women in domestic work, and for approximately 12,000 boys, and a limited number of single men and families, in farm work, at a cost of  132,000&apos; (see Appendix VIII).(vi) Aftercare has been provided, principally for single women, juveniles and children, at a cost of  271,847.THE TWO METHODS OF SETTLEMENT.63. All migration, whether &quot; assisted &quot; or &quot; unassisted &quot;, takes place by means either of group settlement or of infiltration. Bj &apos;&apos; group settlement &apos;&apos; we mean the settlement of a number of migrants as an organised group on a block of virgin or hitherto uncultivated land, e.g., schemes such as the Group Settlement Scheme in Western Australia or the Clandonal Colony in Alberta, or some of the proposals which hate been made at various times for settlements in the Peace River district in Canada. By &quot; infiltration &quot; we mean the settle ment, whether on the land or otherwise, of single individuals J families, in existing communities as and where they may find roes for themselves or room may be found for them; examples of W type range from the wholly unassisted migration which has alwaji even since the passage of the Empire Settlement Act, provide! the great bulk of new settlement overseas, through such schertf
of general assistance as the  10 rate to Canada, up to highly organised schemes dealing with individual settlers or families such as the 3,000 Families Scheme.   .64. Various types of group settlement have always figured very prominently in public discussion of the problems of migration and at the present moment seem to hold the field almost to the exclusion of any other proposals. Nevertheless in the past settle-ment by infiltration has accounted for from 96 per cent, to 99 per cent, of the total volume of migration annually; and even during the currency of the Empire Settlement Act, when for the first time public money from the United Kingdom has been available on a considerable scale for the financing of schemes of migration, group settlement has produced a very small proportion of the total. Of those who were assisted under the Empire Settlement Act during the period 1922-1931, 30,270 persons, including dependents, proceeded to &quot; group &quot; settlements, as against 373,632 persons who were assisted to settle by infiltration; and if we add to the latter the 666,325 persons who settled within the Empire overseas without Government assistance, we find that &quot; group &quot; schemes accounted for approximately 3 per cent, of the total. The pos-sibilities of such schemes are examined in paragraphs 76 to 92.65. We have pointed out in paragraph 63 that all migration, whether &quot; unassisted &quot; or &quot; assisted,&quot; takes place either by means of group settlement or of infiltration. In the. succeeding para-graphs, we propose to deal with : (A) those schemes of assisted migration which are specifically directed to settlement on the land; and(B) those general measures of assistance which may be neces-sary or desirable in order to enable suitable persons to proceed overseas, whether they intend to settle upon the land, or to take advantage of other opportunities.Land Settlement.66. It is not unnatural that organised schemes of settlement in the Dominions, whether of group settlement or settlement by in-filtration, should have been mainly directed to the land. The indus-trial development of the Dominions, and consequently the existence of any considerable source of employment other than agricultural employment, is of comparatively recent growth. The vacant spaces of Canada, Australia and New Zealand presented an obvious con-trast to the crowded cities of the United Kingdom. Furthermore, while the market for the industrial products of the Dominions was clearly limited, there appeared, until recent years, to be no limit to the expansion, at a remunerative price, of the market for agri-cultural commodities. Industrial employment, especially in the smaller towns, was hard to find and harder to keep, while in com-panson a fair living could be made on the land.  Finally, Dominion
Governments were, and still are, under constant pressure to prevent migrant labour from encroaching upon the comparatively limited number of available openings in industry and thereby possibly endangering the relatively high standard of living of the industrial worker in the Dominion.67. Nevertheless, we believe that in fact during the. past 10 years the proportion of migrants who have permanently settled on the land is relatively small.   Definite particulars are not avail-able for the &quot; unassisted &quot; migrants, who constitute 623 per cent, of the whole, or for nominees* to Australia and New Zealand, and persons proceeding under the  10 rate to Canada, who together account for another 19-5 per cent.   But, though it is certain that many of these did in fact settle or find employment on the land, all the indications suggest that the majority found entry into other occupations.   Of the total number of migrants from the United Kingdom to the Dominions during 1922-1931, only 14 per cent, are known to have settled on the land.  Moreover, experience proves that in the case of both assisted and unassisted migrants, a con-siderable proportion of those who at first settle or obtain employ-ment on the land (whether under specified land schemes or other-wise) subsequently leave the land and obtain other employment.68. While therefore constant emphasis has been laid on land settlement as the proper object of migration, and while suggestions have even been made in the Dominions that assisted migration should be limited, in the case of men and boys, to those who are willing to undertake, and do in fact undertake, work on the land,it seems probable that not more than one third, and possibly con-siderably less than one third, of the migrants during the past ten years did in fact go on the land, and that many of those who did originally go on the land left it within a short time. Indeed, as would be expected from the predominantly urban character of the population in the United Kingdom, a considerable proportion of those who are anxious to migrate are ill adapted to an agricultural life, and of those who are at first attracted by the prospect of owning and cultivating their own land, not a few find that the reality falls so far short of their expectations ithat they seize tie earliest opportunity of returning to a town life.69. Agriculture is a pursuit which gives its full reward only to inbred capacity or natural affinity, while those who have no love for it can survive, if at all, only with great difficulty. We are doubt-ful whether a policy of directing incoming migrants to the land!&quot; the exclusion of other occupations can be justified either on economic or on sociological grounds. In so far as the vacant spaces of lb? Empire can be economically filled at all in the near future, ^ believe that it would be wiser that they should be filled by those, whether newly arrived migrants or not, who can find their greatest* The nomination System is described in paragraph 102.
satisfaction in agricultural employment, rather than by those who accept the obligation to work on the land because they can be enabled to migrate on no other condition. While the &quot; drift to the towns &quot;&apos;is perhaps no less marked in the Dominions than in the United Kingdom, it should not be forgotten that that drift is the outcome, in the Dominions as in this country, of an economic change which has very greatly altered, and is still altering, the ratio between industrial and agricultural employment; and we are not aware that there is any evidence to show that there is now, or is likely to be in the future, an unsupplied demand in the Dominions either for farmers or for agricultural workers, or that, if and when such a demand arises, it will not easily be met.70. For these reasons we feel unable to recommend, save in the circumstances mentioned in paragraphs 75 and 93, the continuation of the policy, hitherto pursued under the Empire Settlement Act, of arranging schemes for providing migrants with the necessary capital to enable them to settle on the land. Even during the period of agricultural prosperity between 1923 and 1929, such schemes as the Western Australia Group Settlements and (in a less degree) the 3,000 Eamilies Scheme in Canada, showed a con-siderable ratio of failure and loss.. Apart from the fact that schemes of this kind, even if the most careful attention is given to selection, tend to attract numbers of those who are ready to &quot;try their hand &quot; at farming with the knowledge that, should they not succeed, they have no capital investment of their own in the farm and can walk off without being held accountable for the Government investment therein, we can find no reason to sup-pose that the right sort of migrant, with some experience of farm work in the Dominion concerned, and with some savings behind him, is likely to find great difficulty in obtaining, through a land bank or other similar institution, such capital as may be necessary to enable, him to start on his own.71. It is in the light of the above considerations that we have examined a scheme which has recently received a good deal of attention for selecting and training intending settlers on the land in Canada in such a manner as, it is suggested, will obviate the failure and loss referred to above. Under this scheme, a county or town in the United Kingdom, working through a local Committee appointed for the purpose, would undertake the responsibility for selecting suitable families within its limits and for providing them with training on prepared farms in a favourable mixed farming area in the Dominion, purchased by the county or town for that purpose. The Canadian town nearest to the settlement would be affiliated to the United Kingdom County or Town from which the settlers were drawn and would take an active interest in the settle-ment. During the period of training, which would extend over some five years, the families would gain experience by cultivating the farms under skilled supervision, and would receive a half share
of the produce of their labour, the other half being used to defray the cost of the scheme. It is claimed, and it is indeed an essential part of the scheme, that by this means each of the families would at ithe end of their training have saved about  200. and would have qualified to take up farming on their own account. At this stage, it is proposed that they should be provided with an additional  2$ capital on loan, and should then leave the farms and take up suitable land elsewhere as independent farmers. The scheme ii (to be financed by means of a loan raised in the United Kingdom and guaranteed by the United Kingdom Government.72. Amongst the advantages which are claimed on behalf i this scheme may be mentioned the following : (a) The scheme appeals to local patriotism both in ft United Kingdom and in Canada, and should for this reasoi give a stimulus to the migration movement generally.(&amp;) The method of selection by local committees who know the applicants will ensure that no unsuitable applicant ii approved.(c) The administrators of the scheme will be selected by tie local Committees and will therefore be men who understand the settlers and have their confidence.(d) The intending settlers will have the opportunity j obtaining full experience of Canadian methods and conditions under expert supervision on properly equipped farms before they attempt to take up land and to start farming on their own account.(e) The training farms are to be conducted on mixed farm-ing principles and are not to concentrate on any one product, such as wheat. .(/) Whilst on the training farms the settlers will gain used knowledge of the practical advantages of co-operate marketing.(g) When the time comes for the settlers to take up fan of their own, they are to do so, not under a system of group settlement, but by infiltration into established communities.(h) As a set off against any expenditure incurred by tin United Kingdom Government on the scheme, there would bei saving in respect of unemployment benefit payable in tk United Kingdom.73. On the other hand, the scheme appears to us to be of to criticism on the following grounds : (a) Quite apart from the general economic considerate set out elsewhere in this Report in regard to land settlemeiti it would not be in conformity with the principle of partners!! . mentioned in paragraph 53, to which we attach considers^ importance, that the whole financial responsibility should k undertaken by the United Kingdom Government.
(b) There are objections, which we regard as insuperable, to the proposal to use the Unemployment Fund for purposes of migration and settlement overseas. These are dealt with, in paragraph 194.(c) Past experience gives no ground for supposing that it would be possible for the new settlers to surrender one-half of their produce and, while maintaining themselves and their families on the other half, to save  200 during their five years&apos; training.(d) The financial basis on which the settler is to establish himself on his own after his training is inadequate. It is claimed that he will have saved  200 and this sum is to be made up to  400 by an advance from United Kingdom funds. The evidence available to us goes to show that a properly stocked and equipped farm in Canada would involve a capital liability of considerably more than that sum.74. There are features in this scheme which are undoubtedly attractive. Its proponents are conscious of and have avoided the serious difficulties attendant upon settlement by inexperienced migrants on virgin soil. The scheme is essentially one of settle-ment by infiltration. We agree in thinking that local patriotism is a force which might well be capitalised in the service of oversea-settlement. We agree also that for a settler to start out with no capital of his own, so that.interest and, amortisation represent a really serious charge upon his cash returns, is to court failure, and that capital for settlement should normally only be advanced to those who already have savings of their own. On the other hand, over and above the general considerations relating to all settlement on the land already referred to in paragraphs 66 to 70, we feel that the financial basis of the scheme is unsatisfactory, that the expectations of its promoters are unduly optimistic in certain vital respects, and that in proportion as it deals with any considerable numbers of settlers, the probabilities of failure owing to the difficulty of finding markets for the produce of the training farms tend to increase. We do not feel able to recommend, there-fore, that the United Kingdom Government should be prepared to guarantee the capital and interest required in connection with the above scheme or other schemes on these lines, or to make direct advances to intending settlers under such schemes.75. As we have stated in paragraph 70, we have no reason to suppose that suitable migrants who have acquired the necessary experience of farm work overseas are likely to find great difficulty in obtaining, through a land bank or other institution, such capital as they may need in order to start farming on their own account. If, however, there are in fact localities within the Empire in which, notwithstanding that the prospects for agriculture are good, there is difficulty, either as a result of shortage of capital in the local banks or for any other proper reason, in obtaining adequate
advances for migrants on economic terms, we suggest that the United Kingdom Government should consider on the merits of each -case the possibility of the loan to a suitable institution, preferably a Government agricultural bank or a co-operative bank, of addi-tional capital for this purpose   for   with the local Government. It should, in our opinion, be an absolute condition that the eon-contractual obligation is between the Government and the institution, and not between the Government and the individual migrant.The Relative Advantages of Group Settlement and Settlement hjInfiltration.76. As we have indicated, schemes of Group Settlement ban hitherto engaged an amount of attention which is disproportionate to their actual importance as a means of increasing the volume oi migration to the Dominions. The schemes which have been put forward most recently envisage the creation of public corporation! or chartered companies which would develop and settle areas oi virgin country overseas, on the group principle. Each group ol migrants would come from the same locality and would be care-fully selected and trained in the United Kingdom before sailiij, whilst the holdings on which they are to settle would be partially developed in advance of their, arrival. They would proceed to cultivate their holdings under expert supervision, and arrangements would be made for the marketing of their produce through the controlling organisation. These features are undoubtedly attracted-tive and schemes on these lines have aroused considerable public interest.77. One of the considerations, however, which must be borneio mind in connection with the question of settlements in. virgin country on the group principle is that people bom in the Dominioi concerned are as a rule better equipped to cope with the difficulties of pioneering in new country than migrants from the United Kingdom. Moreover, there has hitherto always.been a constant demand among the native-born in the Dominions for such U* In the following paragraphs we have assumed that group settlemeo necessarily means settlement on the land, and, although such settlements * any considerable scale would afford openings for a limited number of trails-men and professional men, the settlements would nevertheless remain maWF agricultural settlements. Proposals for the transfer from the Unit&quot; Kingdom to the Dominions of complete industrial units, including the wiw or the greater part of the labour employed, have, however, at times been pi forward, and those should presumably also be regarded as proposals for group settlements. It may be pointed out that in actual practice, where TJnfe Kingdom firms have established factories in the Dominions, the operaiuf staff; apart from a few key men, has been recruited from local labour, * indeed has been the case where foreign firms have established factories in ^ United Kingdom. It is therefore clear that, whatever other advantagesBT. attach to such schemes, they can have no appreciable direct effect * migration.
as is thrown open&quot; for settlement, and in some areas this demand has been so considerable as to require allotment by ballot. For both reasons it may well be preferable that migrants should be settled in already existing communities than that they should take part in pioneering enterprises for which they.are not always well adapted.78. It is a fundamental condition of satisfactory settlement, apart from the exception mentioned in paragraph 86, that there must be a reasonably secure and available market for a considerable propor-tion of the produce of the migrants labour; and the question whether such a market exists, or can be developed, is the - first criterion which should be applied to every scheme of migration of every kind. In applying this criterion to proposals for group settle-ments, certain special considerations arise.79. The individual migrant who settles in an existing agricultural community can normally make use of the existing channels of trade to dispose of his produce. Where, however, as is so often the case to-day, the market for any given commodity has reached saturation point, it may be far more difficult to dispose of the produce of a community in a new area than it would be to dispose of a similar quantity produced by a similar number of settlers scattered through existing communities. In the latter case, the newcomer&apos;s wheat or butter or fruit goes in with the rest, passes through the existing channels of trade, and is absorbed with less difficulty, even though the cumulative effect of a number of such increases in local supply may be to depress prices. In the former case, there is a bulk increase in supply concentrated in a fresh area for which a new7 channel has to be provided, and circumstances may well arise in which no outlet can be found for that channel. If a number of such new communities were created, as some people propose, the mere existence of the new supply, even though it might not for the reasons stated above pass into consumption, might have a serious effect upon the price level at which existing supplies can find a market.80. At present, under the Agreement for the regulation of wheat arising out of the World Monetary and Economic Conference, arrangements are being made for restricting the production of wheat in the Dominions and elsewhere, and the possibility of similar restrictions upon the output of other produce is under consideration. If, and for so long as, any such arrangements are in force, there is likely to be very strong objection on the part of existing producers to the creation of new communities whose production will compete with their own for a share in a limited market.81. Apart from these general considerations, experience in the past has shown that, even in favourable economic circumstances, the successful conduct of schemes of organised group settlement demands a special degree of administrative capacity and direction26ss8 B
from the leaders, and of comradeship and cohesion from the: individual settlers.   Furthermore, failure, if it comes, is not always&apos; confined to those who would fail in any circumstances; its effects tend to spread throughout the group, while the failure of the individual settler in an existing community affects only himself.82. The opening up of new areas demands large initial expend! ture for the provision of roads, railways, schools, etc., over and above the comparatively heavy capital investment on land, build ings, stock and equipment, etc., which all land settlement iovolves. Even where the original cost of the land in these new areas is low, the cost of clearing and bringing it into production is generally high.* In the case of settlement by infiltration, on the other hand, roads, railways and schools already exist, and need only be added to as and when, as the result of the gradual marginal expansion the community concerned, the need arises.83. In dealing as we have done in the preceding paragraphs with the question of group settlement on virgin land, we have not lost sight of the possibility of establishing organised group settlements on cultivated soil. It is to be observed, however, that the initial expense of acquiring suitable land which has already been developed is likely materially to increase the cost of such schemes, and that whilst they would avoid the pioneering difficulties referred to in paragraph 77, they would not be exempt from the considerations which we have set out in paragraphs 78 to 80, in regard to markets, and in paragraph 81 in regard to the question of organisation the effect of individual failures.84. We have already expressed the hope, in paragraph 37, the present apparent over-production of most primary commodities! is a temporary phenomenon, and that there will in future be: effective demand for largely increased supplies. Taking into con-sideration, however, the considerable potential increase in produc-tivity per acre already referred to, we are of opinion that there is unlikely to arise in the near future any substantial demand for an extension of the acreage devoted to primary production. When such a demand does arise, it will, we think, be more easily more economically met by the marginal expansion of existing com-munities than by the settlement of large new areas.85. Finally, we would observe that the insistence on group settle-1 ment as the way of salvation from the economic difficulties with I which we are at present surrounded seems to us to argue a certain! disregard of the facts as well as a lack of a sense of proportion. Wei have seen it stated that the volume of migration since the War! fallen short of the volume of migration in the corresponding period prior to the War by a number equivalent to the total present number* In the scheme of group settlement recently put forward by the Einpi&quot; Development and Settlement Research Committee the capital required to settling 40,000 families is estimated at  50,000,000.
of unemployed persons in this county : whence the conclusion is drawn that if migration from the United Kingdom had continued at the same rate since the War as before the War, there would be no unemployment in the United Kingdom to-day. In fact the total volume of migration in the 15 years from 1919 to 1933 falls short by only 533,000 of the total estimated volume of migration* in the 15 years 1899 to 1913. Even if, however, the position were as stated, and if the volume of migration in the last 15 years had been increased by some 2J million, it seems to us to be probable, if not certain, that the economic condition of the Dominions would, as a result, have been materially worse than it is now, in which case the burden of unemployment in this country might well have been increased rather than reduced. Moreover, apart from any arguments (which, for the reason stated above, we regard as highly fallacious) based upon the effect of migration on unemployment, it seems to us clear that group settlement, even if it were likely in other respects to be successful, could not possibly, for administrative if for no other reasons, account for more than, say, 10,000 migrants a year at the most; and it is highly unlikely that, over a period of years, it could account for anything like such a number. The migration of 10,000 persons a year, however, while no doubt it would be valuable if it were successful, cannot be regarded as a very serious contribution to the problem of the redistribution of population within the Empire. When it is considered that such migration could hardly be effected at a less capital cost than  200 a head (the full recovery of which experience has shown to be, doubtful) whereas the average cost of the grant of assistance to 404,000 persons under the. Empire Settlement Act (exclusive of 666,000 unassisted migrants) has been no more than  15 a head, we are led irresistibly to the conclusion that while the method of group settlement is not necessarily inconsistent with that of settle-ment by infiltration, the risks, financial and otherwise, of the former are out of all proportion to the results likely to be achieved, and that far greater results, at far less cost in money and in hardship, are likely to be effected by other methods. We therefore recom-mend that in future no special assistance should be given by the United Kingdom Government to schemes for group settlement save in the exceptional circumstances mentioned in paragraph 93.Subsistence Settlement.86. Before leaving the question of group settlement, reference may be made to the proposals which have recently been put for-ward for a special form of group settlements on a &quot; subsistence &quot; basis, i.e., settlements intended to be independent of any external market for their produce.* The actual migration figures were not separately published before 1912 and the present estimate is calculated according to the ratio of migrants to passengers since 1912.
87. In present economic conditions, when hardly any primary product is being sold on the world market at such a price as to give a remunerative return to the producer, proposals for sub-sistence group settlements offer obvious attractions. As we understand it, those who are responsible for these proposals con-template&apos; that the settlers would be able to feed and clothe them-selves and their families, as did the Boer voortrekker or the frontier settlers in the United States, from the produce grown by them on their own land; and that such a result would, at any rate for the first few years, be a sufficient fulfilment of the minimum require-ment for satisfactory settlement suggested in paragraph 25.88. It must in the first place be recognised that the very great economic and social changes which have taken place since the first half of the nineteenth century render it unlikely that any consider-able number of men and women would be found willing to face the immense hardships and the extreme monotony, both of diet and manner of living, which were accepted by settlers overseas as natural and inevitable a hundred years ago. It follows both that the soil which the settlers are to occupy must be capable of producing a wide variety of products, and that the community, in order to get the advantages on the one hand of specialisation, and on the other of wide distribution, must be of some size, and must, during the early years at any rate, work as a team and under strict control, with the risk of internal dissension and jealousy inherent in such a system. A single family, or a village group, on a &quot; subsistence &quot; basis, could only achieve an extremely low standard of living.89. Further, it is often overlooked that, even if a community of this kind, once established, could continue to exist, and to maintain a reasonable standard of living without recourse to external markets, a substantial amount of capital is in any case necessary for the initial purchase and /or development of land, for stock and equipment, and for the maintenance of the settlers during the early period in which no crops are produced; and that this capital can never be repaid unless the community is in a position to sell its surplus produce elsewhere.   -90. Finally, assuming that a suitable site is selected and that the difficulty of capital can be surmounted, such a scheme would obviously require leadership and organisation of a very high quality, and the most careful selection of settlers, with a view both to securing the proper proportion between the various trades and occu-pations, and to enrolling only those who would be able and willing to work under direction and as part of a team.91. As against the difficulties enumerated above, it is to be -observed that such a community would tend to pass more or less rapidly (according to the changes in world conditions) out of the &quot; subsistence &quot; stage and to take its place in the world as an ordinary community exchanging its surplus products with those o!
other communities, but with the advantage that it could, if neces-sary, maintain a reasonable standard of living in times of depres-sion more easily than communities whose economy is based on the production of a more limited range of commodities. It is in the main only during the early years of the settlement &apos;s existence that the difficulties set out above would have to be faced.92. In our opinion, taking all the above factors into consideration, it should be possible, in favourable circumstances, and given the right leadership, to establish one or more communities of this kind within the Empire. The dangers of failure, through faulty selec-tion of location or settlers, mistakes of organisation, internal dis-sension, or other causes such as the strong attractions of city life, would, however, in our opinion be great, a/nd areas fulfilling all the necessary conditions, such as suitable climate and fertility of soil, are few. In all the circumstances, therefore, we do not regard the creation of such settlements in the Dominions as anything but an insignificant contribution towards the solution of the problem of migration.An Exceptional Case.93. We have referred in paragraphs 14 and 15 to the general political considerations affecting migration within the Empire. In our subsequent examination of schemes of land settlement we have confined ourselves to the purely economic considerations involved. We are, however, conscious that exceptional circumstances may be present in some parts of the Empire which may justify the grant of special assistance to schemes of migration although the grant of such assistance might not be justified on purely economic grounds. While, therefore, we do not, for the reasons set out in the preceding paragraphs of this Report, feel able to recommend that any en-encouragement should be given to schemes of land settlement gen-erally, we should not wish this view to be regarded as ruling out the grant of assistance to such schemes in exceptional circumstances.94. In the preceding paragraphs we have considered from the point of view not only of agriculture but of other occupations the relative advantages of settlement by infiltration,  and of group settlement.   We have come to the conclusion that when circum-stances are favourable, settlement by infiltration offers the best ! prospects for a large volume of successful migration at a reason-1 able cost, and we have now to consider the means by which settle-; ment of this kind may be facilitated.G-eneral Reduced Passage Rates.95. Assuming the existence of conditions overseas which will attract a substantial volume of unassisted migrants, there will in-I inevitably be considerable numbers of persons who would make I admirable settlers and who desire to migrate, but who are pre-I vented from doing so by inability to provide or secure the moneyI       26338 h 3
* We shall use the term &quot; general reduced rate &quot; throughout this rep&quot;&apos; to describe a passage rate open to all migrants paying their own way. &apos;s distinct from the special nomination rate.necessary for the conveyance of themselves and their dependents overseas. It appears to us that the Government should provide assistance within certain limits to meet this difficulty.96. The following considerations should be taken into account in connection with any such scheme : (a) It is desirable that the migrant should be made to feel as far as possible, that he is in fact an unassisted migrant, pro-ceeding independently and on his own resources. For this reason the assistance should preferably be provided in the form of a reduced passage and not of a free passage; and it should be open to all migrants who are prepared to travel third-class and not merely to such migrants as produce evidence of need,(b) In fairness to the Shipping Companies and to avoid repercussions on their higher-class and tourist fares and on their inward passage rates, it should be made clear to the public that, while the acceptance of the general reduced passage rate&apos; does not in any way derogate from the independence of &apos;migrant, it is an uneconomic rate which the Companies could not afford to provide without assistance from the Government.(c) It is important that any general reduced rate should k withdrawn if and when conditions become adverse to successful migration. In so far as the existence of such a rate had effect of inducing persons to migrate in unsuitable conditions, or with doubtful prospects of success, it would be definitely uneconomic.(d) The general reduced rate should, if possible, be an in-elusive rate to the final place of settlement. It was a definite drawback to the  10 rate to Canada which was in operation from 1929 to. 1931, that the migrant desiring to proceed to 1 Prairie Provinces or British Columbia found that a substantial additional sum was required to carry him from the port of arrival to his place of settlement. If and when conditions appear to justify such a scheme in the case of Canada, con-sideration should, in our opinion, be given to the possibilityo! establishing an inclusive ocean and land rate from any point i in Great Britain or Northern Ireland to any point (a) east of j and including Montreal, (b) west of Montreal and east of: up to and including Winnipeg, and (c) west of Winnipeg. In \ view of the far greater proportion borne by the ocean fare t the land fare in the case of Australia and New Zealand, it ( would perhaps be possible to establish an inclusive fare any point in Great Britain or Northern Ireland to any ] in Australia or New Zealand.
39 4) w &amp;97. In the light of these considerations the general reduced passage rates for migrants paying their own way which we would regard as suitable are in the region of  10,  12 and  14 respectively for the three areas into which Canada is divided in the preceding paragraph, and of  17 10s. in the case of Australia and New Zealand/ We are of the opinion that the cost of -a scheme of this kind should not be borne by the United Kingdom Govern-ment alone, but should be equitably shared between the Govern-ments and/or public or private organisations concerned, and that in no case should the share of the United Kingdom Government exceed 50 per cent.98. In connection with the question of general reduced passage rates on the outward voyage, we have also considered proposals which have been made from time to time for the provision of cheap return passages which would enable migrants who desire to do so to return home, either permanently or for a visit. This subject was dealt with at some length by the Committee on Empire Migra-tion appointed by the Economic Advisory Council. They were unable to recommend that Government assistance should be pro-vided in respect of any general system of return passages, though they did not consider that the objections to such a system neces-sarily applied to the provision of return passages to the United Kingdom and back to enable a limited number of &quot; specially de-serving migrants &quot; to pay a visit to this country after three or four years overseas.! We concur generally in the arguments put for-ward by the Committee, but we are of the opinion that any ex-penditure that may be incurred in connection with the provision of return passages of the second kind, referred to is a matter for philanthropic rather than for Government action. Any such arrangements should be undertaken, if at all, by Voluntary Organisations in consultation with the Shipping Companies. We do not recommend that the United Kingdom Government should make any financial contributions towards such arrangements.99. It is to be observed that, inasmuch as a general reduced passage rate must be open to all migrants (see paragraph 96 (a)), its benefits will inevitably be extended to a number of migrants who would otherwise have been willing and able to pay the ordinary fare; and that to this extent Government expenditure in providing a cheap fare is ineffective in producing additional migration.   The* The present full ocean fare to Quebec is  17 5s., and the present rail fare from Quebec to (a) Montreal is $4-90, (b) Winnipeg $25-00, (c) Van-couver $46-25.

figures relating to the  10 passage rate to Canada* (in the case of which the cost to the United Kingdom Government was  4 7s. 6d. per adult) would appear to show although it is impossible to draw conclusions from these figures with any confidence that probably not more than one-third of the number of those who travelled at the reduced rate would have migrated at the ordinary rate. Pro-vided that the cost per head to the United Kingdom Government of the cheap rate is not too high, it would appear to us to be worth while, on account of the wider considerations involved, to incur this ineffective expenditure in the provision of general reduced passage rates.100. For the reasons stated in paragraph 96 we should regard the introduction of general reduced passage rates for migrants to the Dominions as the most effective measure of stimulating satis-factory migration within the Empire as soon as economic circum-stances become favourable to such migration. It would enable many who would otherwise have been unable to migrate to do so without thereby being treated by the oversea Governments as though they were &apos;&apos; assisted &apos;&apos; migrants or being limited to certain areas or certain classes of occupation, and to find their own level with the minimum of disturbance to the social structure and external markets of their new country. Moreover, it affords no encouragement to the belief, which has prejudiced many migratioi schemes, that the migrant is not in the last resort dependent upoi himself for his success or failure.101. There will, however, always be suitable people for whom openings are available overseas, who will not be able to provide even the cost of the general reduced passage rates out of their own&apos; pocket. If it is desired to-facilitate the migration of such people, it will be necessary that schemes of assisted passages should he* The figures in the following table show the total numbers of migrants t) Canada in the year 1928, and in the yeaTs 1929, 1930 and 1931 during whitl the  10 rate was available:   	Assisted under Empire Settle-ment Act.

arranged. Appendix V contains a summary of the various assisted passage rates which were in operation in 1929 in connection with schemes arranged under the Empire Settlement Act, 192-2. Since 1929 these schemes have been in abeyance. It will be observed that in some cases free passages were made available, whilst in others the amount payable by the migrant was reduced to very small proportions. In certain instances even that amount could be advanced from Government funds by way of a loan to be repaid by instalments after the arrival of the migrant overseas.THE NOMINATION SYSTEM.102. The most important, and, in our opinion, the most successful of these schemes, is that whereby assisted passages are granted to persons or families desiring to migrate from the United Kingdom who are nominated by friends or. relatives in the Dominions concerned, the nominator undertaking to be responsible, for a stated period, for obtaining suitable accommodation and satisfactory employment for the nominee. It is a natural and proper requirement of this system that the oversea Government concerned should approve both the nominator and the nominee. Under this system from the passing of the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, to the end of 1931 no fewer than 113,575 persons out of a total assisted movement of 172,149 have migrated to Australia, 37,116 out of a total assisted movement of 44,619 to New Zealand, and 44,826 out of a total assisted movement of 127,847 to Canada (where the system was limited in the case of families and single men to persons willing to engage in agricultural employment, and in the case of single women to those prepared to undertake house-hold work). Thus, in all, out of a total assisted movement of approximately 403,000, there were approximately 200,000 nominees.103. Analogous to the nomination system described in the pre-ceding paragraph are the system of Government requisitions and the system of bulk nomination by approved voluntary organisa-tions. Under the system of Government requisitions, the State Governments in Australia having satisfied themselves that there was a local shortage of certain types of workers, would request the Commonwealth authorities to recruit the required numbers of migrants in the United Kingdom on a guarantee of employment on arrival in Australia. A similar system was made use of by the Canadian Government. Under the bulk nomination system, the oversea headquarters of an approved organisation was entitled to nominate such a number of migrants recommended by the head-quarters of the organisation in this country and in such categories as might be approved by the Dominion Government concerned. All migrants so requisitioned or nominated were eligible (subject
to the approval of each individual by the representative in the United Kingdom of the Oversea Government) for a passage at the nominated rate.104. We have come to the conclusion that it will be desirable in future that assisted passages should be provided exclusively as nominated passages, the term nomination being applied not only to nominations by friends or relatives as described in paragraph 102, but also to the system of requisitions by oversea Governments and to the system of bulk nomination described in paragraph 103. We have referred in paragraph 102 to the fact that hitherto the system of nomination has been of limited application in the case of Canada. In our view, the advantages of the system are such that we recommend that every endeavour should be made to arrange with the Canadian Government for the nomination system to be extended to cover all classes of migrants proceeding to that Dominion.105. The advantages of the nomination system approximate very closely to those of the general reduced passage rate.   Indeed, the two systems overlap to a large degree, and it is arguable that where, as in the case of Australia and New Zealand, nominated migrants are free to take up any form of employment, there is no need for a reduced passage rate apart from that available to nominated persons.   We are disposed to the view, however, that there is room for both systems side by side, provided that it can be arranged with the oversea Government concerned that nominated migrants shall be granted passages at a rate even lower than the general reduced passage rate.   On the one hand, there are always likely to be numbers of persons desiring to settle overseas who may be unable to obtain a nomination, and it is, in our opinion, desirable to encourage as far as possible those who are able to migrate on their own to do so.   On the other hand, in the case of those persons who are able to obtain nominations and whose resources are very limited, the addition to their capital of the amount saved by the grant of a nominated passage at a rate cheaper than toe general reduced rate may be of great value in assisting them to settle down in their new home.  Further, the fact that those already established in a Dominion can give, by nomination, really valuable assistance to friends and relatives at home who desire to settle over-seas will do much, we believe, to encourage satisfactory settlement, and to create that sense of mutual obligation and common interest which has, in our opinion, been an important factor in the builds up of some of the foreign settlements in Canada and has not hitherto been e s pronounced among British settlers as could have t* wished.Passage Loans.106. We do not consider that migrants intending to proceed o* seas at the general reduced rate should be given any direct financial assistance towards the payment of their fares either by Government&apos;&apos;
or by voluntary organisations. These migrants are to be treated by the oversea Governments in all respects as full fare paying passen-ffers, and this would be impracticable if they had in fact received any such direct financial assistance. On the other hand, we are of the opinion that under the nomination system, whether the nomina-tion be effected by friends or relatives, by an oversea Government or by a voluntary organisation, there should be provision for advancing from Government funds and/or from the funds of voluntary organi-sations, such part of the balance of the passage money as the approved migrant himself is unable to pay. These advances would be repayable by the migrant in suitable instalments after his arrival overseas.107. To sum up, we recommend that passage assistance to United Kingdom migrants intending to settle in other parts of the Empire should be provided in future by means of(a) general reduced passage rates open to all migrants who are prepared to travel third-class.(b) nominated passages at cheaper rates than the general reduced passage rates, to be available to approved persons nominated by friends or relatives or by approved voluntary organisations, or accepted under requisitions from oversea Governments, and that in cases where persons eligible for nominated passages are unable to pay the whole of the cost, provision should be made for advancing such amount as may be necessary by way of loan.SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS.108. In the past, special arrangements have been made for families for land settlement, single women willing to engage in household work, children, juveniles and single men for farm work. We have considered whether such special arrangements should be continued in the future, and have reached the following conclusions.Families.109. Family migration has always been regarded for a variety of reasons as one of the most satisfactory forms of migration. The family is a homogeneous unit containing within itself many of the elements of stability and permanence in settlement. The fact that the parents and children are together helps them to overcome the inevitable homesickness which is often a serious obstacle to successful settlement overseas. The children have the advantage of growing up in their new environment in the natural way under the care of their parents. Moreover, family migration helps to redress the excess movement of males which tends to take place in the migration of individuals.   In actual practice, both before and after
the War, 35 per cent, of those who migrated from the United Kingdom went overseas as members of families, and in the case of assisted migration since the War, the proportion rose to 50 per cent.110. Family migration, however, presents special problems, since the provision of accommodation immediately on arrival is more difficult in the case of the family than of the individual, and immediate employment must be found which will enable the head of the family to provide for his dependents as well as himself from the start. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that the bulk of the families who have proceeded overseas under the Empire Settlement Act should have done so under the nomination system, to which we refer in paragraphs 102 to 105. In the case of Australia, while most of the families so nominated found openings in industry, a proportion have also been provided with opportunities under the schemes of land settlement organised by the various State Govern-ments. In the case of Canada, passage assistance for families was only available under the Government assisted passage scheme for those intending to undertake work on the land.111. In this connection, we desire to refer to our recommendation in paragraph 104 that every endeavour should be made to arrange with the Canadian Government for the nomination system to lie extended to all classes of migrants proceeding to that Dominion, We regard this extension as particularly important in the case of families. We also recommend that in view of the desirability of encouraging family migration, the United Kingdom Government should endeavour to arrange with the Dominion Governments con-cerned that in fixing rates for assisted passages special consideration should be given to the case of families.*112. In the past, cottage schemes were inaugurated in rural areas in Canada, with the co-operation of certain non-Governmental organisations in Canada, in order to meet the difficulty of providing suitable accommodation for families. Families from the United Kingdom were placed in these cottages at a nominal rental, anJ found employment with neighbouring farmers. It was anticipate! that after a period of, say, two years, the families would qualify for settlement under land settlement schemes, or would otherwise pro-vide for themselves so as to leave the cottages available for fresh families from the United Kingdom. Thus, over a period of 50 years, each cottage might on an average have served as a starting point for the settlement of 10 families.113. While we have stated elsewhere in this report that we haw doubts whether a policy of directing migrants to work on the lffli to the exclusion of other occupations can be justified, we never-theless feel that the provision of additional accommodation of the* In the case of New Zealand the cost of passages for an entire farnilJi including man and wife, sons and daughters, was as low as  22, proviftf that the boys were under 19 years of age.
type mentioned overseas would give an opportunity for an increased number of families from the United Kingdom to gain experience of local conditions and in due course to establish themselves in suitable occupations, whether on the land or otherwise, in the Dominion where they intend to settle. For this reason we recommend that the experiment in connection with the cottages schemes to which we refer in the preceding paragraph should be continued on a small scale when conditions are again favourable.Single Women.*114. In paragraph 109, we referred to the fact that an excess movement of males tends to take place in the migration of in-dividuals,, and we therefore regard it as highly desirable that a definite effort should be made in future to correct the balance of the sexes proceeding overseas. The tendency for male migrants to outnumber females is distinctly disadvantageous both to the United Kingdom and to the Dominions, since it aggravates a diffi-culty which has long been regarded with grave concern from the sociological point of view. In the United Kingdom, females out-number males by approximately two millions, while on the other hand there is, generally speaking, an excess of males in the Dominions, at any rate in the rural areas. When in addition it is borne in mind that this form of migration increases the prospect of permanent settlement by the establishment of new homes in the Dominions, it will be obvious that a considerable migration of women is much to be desired.115. One of the steps taken under the Empire Settlement Act to encourage the migration of women was the provision at the joint cost of the United Kingdom and oversea Governments of free or very cheap passages to those women who were willing to engage in domestic work overseas. We have laid down in paragraph 96 (a) the general principle that assistance to migrants should prefer-ably not be provided in the form of a free passage. We clo not think that there is any justification for treating the case of women as an exception to this general principle, and we therefore recom-mend that when conditions permit of a revival of assisted migra-tion, the system of free passages for women should be discontinued, but that for the reasons stated in paragraph 114, cheap passages at a rate of, say,  2 should be made available.Children.116. There can, in our view, be no question as to the desirability of encouraging by all available means the migration of young* As regards aftercare for single women, juveniles and children, see para-grapks 145 to 149.
children. Apart from the wide opportunities available in the Domin-ions for the healthy upbringing of children, the fact that child migrants are brought up from a tender age in the country of settle-ment generally renders their absorption as adults into the com. muhity far easier than is the case with other migrants. No doubt, owing to the comparatively long period during which child migrants are unable to earn or contribute to their own maintenance, and the necessity for somewhat elaborate aftercare, such migration is ex-pensive ; but against this must be set the fact that their up-bringing in this country would have been a charge against public and/or charitable funds. We consider, therefore, that a comparatively liberal expenditure by the United Kingdom Government would be well justified if by its means a substantial measure of child migra. tion could be secured. Such assistance should, in our opinion, in-clude arrangements for free passages. We regard the case of children as forming an exception to the general principle laid down in paragraph 96 (a) on this point.117. For many years before the War, child migration was carried on by a number of voluntary societies which confined their opera-tions mainly to Canada. The children were approved before migra-tion by the Canadian Authorities and were placed out, usually in country districts, with selected families. The intention was tl they should be treated in all respects as members of the families with which they were placed. In the case of some Societies s boarding-out fee was paid by the Society.until the children reached the age of 12 years, but between the ages of 12 and 14 no board-ing-out fee was paid. After the age of 14 the children were placed, in employment at a suitable wage. Each of the Societies was required by the Canadian authorities to maintain in Canada a head quarters for the reception and distribution of the children and: staff of visitors to supervise the arrangements for placing them and for their subsequent welfare. The Dominion Government also appointed Inspectors of its own, to see that the operations were properly carried out.118. The Bondfield Delegation of 1924 investigated and reported upon the operation of the system of child migration in Canada (Cmd. 2285). They found that the children were, generally spei ing, expected to undertake an undue proportion of the work in the j homes in which they were placed, that they were not in practice on an equal footing with the children of the family, and that this was particularly noticeable in those cases where no boarding-ont fee was being paid. The Delegation also had some reason to sup-pose that the boarding-out arrangements had not always be adequately supervised. They therefore recommended that f migration of children under 14 should be discontinued, and tl children should not leave the United Kingdom until they h attained working age.   This recommendation was adopted by t
Dominion Government and subsequently the migration to Canada of young -children other than as members of families has been prohibited.119. We strongly deprecate any suggestion that young children should be sent overseas for working purposes, or that when placed out in families there should be any discrimination against them as compared with the children of the family. On the other hand, we feel that the migration of young children has so much in its favour that it would be well to consider the possibility of encouraging the movement by a revival of the boarding-out system under very care-ful safeguards against the above-mentioned defects. These safe-guards could, in our opinion, be provided by a strict limitation of the Societies authorised to board children out, by making it com-pulsory to pay a boarding-out fee in respect of each child until it had attained the school-leaving age, by arranging for more effective inspection to ensure that the conditions of placement are being properly observed in every respect, and by organising local women&apos;s committees to take an active interest in the children. A success-ful boarding-out system has for some time been in operation in this country, and it would perhaps be wise to permit only organisa-tions which have experience of such work to undertake it overseas. We recognise that it may be more difficult to ensure effective inspec-tion in a country where distances are so great as in Canada, but if that difficulty can be overcome we feel that under the above condi-tions it ought to be possible to ensure that the children are not com-pelled to work or kept away from school before they have attained the school-leaving age, and that they are properly treated in other-respects. We do not consider that the ordinary small duties which children are usually expected to perform in their homes should be regarded as work from this point of view.120. We recommend, therefore, that the Canadian Government should be approached with a view to the re-introduction of the boarding-out system on the above conditions, and on the understand-ing that permission to undertake the migration of children by this method should be confined to Voluntary Societies approved by the Dominion Government and the United Kingdom Government jointly. The cost should in the main be borne by the Voluntary-Societies, which should be allowed to accept children from Public Assistance Committees or other organisations ; but we are of opinion that the United Kingdom Government might properly contribute so much of the cost, within defined limits, as might be shown to be in excess of the cost of maintaining the children in this country.121. Since the discontinuance of the boarding-out system as a result of the Bondfield Report, the only avenue for child migration has been provided by the Child Emigration Society at the Fair-bridge Farm School in Western Australia, and by Dr. Barnardo&apos;s Homes at a somewhat similar institution in New South Wales.
In our opinion the &quot; Farm School &quot; system*, inaugurated by the Child Emigration Society, is beyond question the most satisfactory and successful method of establishing young children overseas, and we think that the establishment of similar farm schools in other Australian States and in other Dominions should be encouraged. The system is comparatively expensive; but we believe that the expense has been fully justified by the results.122. In the past, the United Kingdom Government has cor.tr.-buted both to the capital and maintenance costs of the Farm Schools established by the Child Emigration Society and Dr. BarnardoV Homes, and we are of the opinion that such contributions should be continued in the future and that the oversea Government con-cerned should be invited to help in a similar manner. At present, for example, both the Commonwealth Government and the Govern-ment of Western Australia are contributing towards the main-tenance expenditure of the Fairbridge Farm School. The Society responsible for the establishment of the school would, of course, be expected to provide the basic cost, calculated according to the amount required to maintain an orphan or destitute child in the United Kingdom. We recommend that the contribution of the United Kingdom Government towards such a scheme should take* It may perhaps be useful to describe in some detail the arrangements at the Fairbridge Farm School. This Farm School was founded before the War by a Rhodes Scholar, Kingsley Fairbridge. It has since been extended and is now able to accommodate 350 children at a time. Children recruited from the United Kingdom at ages between 8 and 12 years are placed in cottages, each containing about 15 children, under the oare of a matron, who is regarded as the house-mother. The cottages form a model village, being grouped round a church, a school and a central community hall. They are situated in the midst of an area of land, 3,500 acres in extent, wliicl provides ample opportunity for carrying out all kinds of agricultural opera-tions. The boys and girls in this way become accustomed to a country life and learn the rudiments of work on a farm. The boys become accustomed to animals and learn how to harness and drive a horse and how to milk a cow, in addition to performing various agricultural operations. The girls are taught the ordinary household duties as well as work connected with the dairy, the raising of poultry, etc. All the children go through the ordinary educational curriculum for children of their age in the school on the farm which is staffed by the State with the necessary teachers.On reaching school-leaving age the boys and girls are placed out in suit-able situations which have been found for them, usually in country districts. The homes in which they are to be placed are carefully inspected in advance by the Farm School authorities and the children are visited at regular intervals after placement in order that any difficulties may be smoothed over and fresh places found, if necessary, for those who are not settling down satisfactorily.Taking the average course of training as covering a period of five years, some 70 children are placed out from the Farm School annually. Tie careers of the children have, with very few exceptions, been successful, and there is a long waiting list of employers who are anxious to obtain help of; this kind. (Many of the boys have opportunities of obtaining farms of their own; in due course either through the share farming system (see Appendix VI) or otherwise.
the form of a payment not exceeding 50 per cent, of the capital cost of instituting the Farm School, together with a contribution within defined limits towards any maintenance expenditure in excess of the basic cost.Juveniles (aged 14 to 18).123. While the mechanisation of agriculture will no doubt tend to diminish the demand for boys for farm work, as it has diminished the demand for single men, we consider it likely that there will always be openings in the Dominions for juveniles, particularly boys, and we are of opinion that this is a form of migration which should be encouraged. In view of the necessity for relatively pro-longed aftercare and supervision, the general reduced passage rate and the nomination system by themselves are not sufficient to serve the needs of this category of migrant. We consider that it would be inadvisable to make provision in future for free passages for juveniles but we recommend that arrangements should be made for the provision of passages at half the ordinary nominated rate. With regard to girls between the ages of 14 and 18, the necessity for supervision and aftercare is such that individual safeguards are essential. It will, for example, be impossible to encourage the migration of young girls apart from their families unless adequate provision is made for their welfare on board ship, for their reception on arrival, for active supervision over their place-ment in suitable homes, and for their subsequent wellbeing. We consider that in all these matters the control should be in the hands of women, and that there should be the closest co-ordination of Government and voluntary effort. In our opinion, therefore, the best method of effecting and encouraging juvenile migration generally is by means of bulk nomination carried out by suitable voluntary organisations working in close touch with the United Kingdom and oversea Governments. This method of assisted migration is described in paragraph 103.124. An important question in connection with the migration of boys is that of the opportunities which are likely to be available I to them for making a career for themselves whether on the land I or in industry or otherwise, after they have acquired the necessary I experience of local conditions.   Considerable attention has been I paid to this question in the past.   For instance, under the farm I apprenticeship scheme for boys conducted by the Government of I Queensland, a percentage of the wages earned by the boys during their apprenticeship was deducted by the Government and deposited in the State Savings Bank, so that a lump sum might be available for them on completion of their apprenticeship.   Similar arrange-ments have from time to time been made by voluntary organisa-tions concerned in the settlement of youths in other States of I Australia and in Canada.   The main object of the Big Brother I Movement in Australia is to secure a continuation of semi-parental
supervision over migrant boys under their care ^during their early years, with a view to helping them to make a career for thern-selves. In Canada, a further step was taken in the direction of ensuring the opportunity of a career on the land to suitable boys by the conclusion of an Agreement, between the United Kingdom and the Canadian Governments, to supplement the capital of boys who had saved up at least  100 and had shown themselves properly qualified in other respects, in order to enable them to acquire farms of their own. That scheme has been inoperative, largely owing to unfavourable economic conditions.125. We have considered the question of the future operation of the Canadian Scheme and the establishment of similar schemes in other Dominions for the provision by the United Kingdom Govern-ment of capital to enable suitable boys to acquire farms of their own.   We have come to the conclusion that such schemes are unnecessary and undesirable.   Apart from the general questions relating to the provision of capital to individual migrants for land settlement set out in paragraph 70, such schemes tend to make the boy look back to the United Kingdom Government for assistance instead of regarding himself from the first as a citizen of his new country.   This consideration has already been referred to in para-graph 47.   We see no reason for singling out boy migrants for special treatment of this kind.    Indeed, in so far as any pro-vision placed the migrant in a more favourable position than the   native-born   boy,   it   would   tend   to   create   a  prejudice against  the migrant boy amongst the native-born population, whilst it  must  also  be  borne  in  mind  that  no  similar pro-vision  is  made   to  enable  boys  who  have   not  migrated to take up land in the United Kingdom.   On the other hand, there would not. be the same objection to approved voluntary organisa-tions, either in this country or overseas, raising funds from which capital advances at a low rate of interest could be made to boys who have duly qualified overseas to enable them to take up careers either on the land or in other directions.126. We are, however, strongly of the opinion that it is most desirable to make arrangements which ensure that migrant boy; save a proportion of their wages so that they are in possession of at any rate a small amount of capital by the time they become ex-ineperienced in local conditions, and we consider that provision for such saving, either compulsory or voluntary, should be regarded as a normal part of the aftercare work concerned with boy migration,127. One means by which a suitable boy might gradually acquirf a farm of his own is by the system known as &quot; share farming,&quot; concerning which details are given in Appendix VI. This system, which is general throughout Australia and New Zealand, but has hitherto been less common elsewhere in the Empire, might, in on&apos; opinion, be more widely extended.
hi ;-j C?Single Men.128. As a result of the greater mechanisation of agriculture it is unlikely that there will be as great a demand for the migration of single men for farm work in the future as in the past. If any special opening should arise, offering opportunities for the satis-factory absorption of a number of single men, special ad hoc arrangements could no doubt be made. Apart from this possibility, the facilities offered by a general reduced passage rate or the nomination system should, in our opinion, suffice.Miscellaneous.129. In addition to the categories mentioned above, certain types of migrant are dealt with under special schemes, i.e., those of the 1820 Memorial Settlers&apos; Association in South Africa, the Fellow-ship of the Maple Leaf and the Anglo-Canadian Education Com-mittee. The work done by these Societies, which have in the past received grants from the United Kingdom Government, is described in Appendix VII. We regard this work as highly desirable and we recommend that it should be encouraged in the future by a continuation of the Government grants.V.-THE FUNCTION OF THE VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS.130. We have given reasons in the preceding sections of this Eeport for our view that any intervention which the United Kingdom Government may think proper to make in the initiation and administration of schemes of migration, and in the provision of assistance to the individual migrant, should be as unobtrusive as pos-sible. Direct encouragement and assistance by the United Kingdom Government tends, in our view, to foster in the minds of individual migrants the belief that that Government gives some guarantee of the success of their undertaking, and that con-sequently they are entitled to look to the Government for assistance in every emergency. Such a belief we regard as seriously inimical to successful migration.131. In the general reduced passage rate and the nomination system, the visible intervention of the United Kingdom Govern-ment is reduced to a minimum. The migrant proceeding by the general reduced passage rate pays his fare and proceeds on his journey like any other passenger, the sole requirement being that in order to obtain the reduced rate he has to sign a declaration that he intends to settle in the country to which he is proceeding. The nominee has to produce evidence of his nomination to the satis-faction of the Government of the Dominion to which he is pro-ceeding, and to submit to such examination, medical and other-wise, as may be imposed, by that Government as a condition of their approval.
132. We have already mentioned in paragraph 103 the system under which approved voluntary organisations have been given the power of nomination under certain conditions, and in paragraph 106 we have recommended that provision should be made for assistance by way of passage loans in the case of migrants nominated by a voluntary organisation where such migrants are not themselves in a position to pay the whole of the passage money at the nominated rate. It is also desirable that, even in the case of those migrants who proceed overseas on their own resources, some arrangement for reception and advice on arrival should be available in case of need. Moreover, aftercare, both in reception and placement and by way of inspection, replacement, advice, etc., is essential in certain cases, and we are not satisfied that the United Kingdom Government can properly divest themselves entirely of responsibility for the provision of such aftercare at any rate in the case of single women, juveniles and children. For the reasons we have already stated, we regard it as undesirable (and in the case of aftercare it would not be possible) that such assistance should be provided directly by the United Kingdom Government.The ideal type of Organisation.133. Work such as that referred to in the preceding paragraph in connection with passage loans, reception and aftercare has already been carried out with conspicuous success by some of the voluntary organisations dealing with migration, and we recommend that provision should be made for the continuance and, where necessary, the extension of the work of approved voluntary organisations in these directions. The organisations we have in mind would preferably be those which have branches or permanent representatives, widely scattered throughout the community, both in the United Kingdom and in the Dominions, and which are able to. call upon the voluntary services of as many social workers as are needed. The local Committee or representative on this side would also see that the selected applicants were properly informed and equipped, and would assist them to the port of departure, where the Headquarters would already have arranged for their passage.134. At the Dominion end, such an organisation would collect information from its district representatives or committees, as to the number of migrants in their several categories for whom open-ings could be found. This information would be transmitted from the Dominion headquarters of the organisation, with the approval of the oversea Government concerned, to the headquarters in the United Kingdom, which would already have obtained througli similar district representatives or committees in the United Kingdom particulars of persons who desired to settle overseas, and who were regarded as likely to make good settlers. On arrival overseas the organisation concerned would make arrangements to
welcome the migrants, provide them with temporary accommoda-tion for such periods as may be necessary, and send them on to their final destination, where the local committee or representative would be responsible for receiving them and giving them such further assistance by way of welcome, advice and neighbourly good offices, as would ensure that they should start their new life under favour-able auspices. We believe that arrangements of this kind would be of the utmost value in tiding over the period of homesickness which is almost inevitable in the case of every migrant, and has in many cases been the first impulse towards ultimate failure.135. In order to avoid overlapping we consider it, essential that central Committees should be appointed both in the United Kingdom and overseas, on which the various voluntary organisa-tions would be represented, and which could co-ordinate the activi-ties of those organisations in such a way as to combine the maxi-mum of efficiency with the minimum of expenditure, whether of money or of effort. We deal with other aspects of this matter in paragraphs 136, 142 and 182.13&apos;6. The work of the voluntary organisations, if it is to be efficiently performed, requires careful and capable administration. Apart from the necessary organisation at headquarters in the United Kingdom and overseas, at least one travelling organiser is required, and possibly more than one, in each country concerned, whose duty it will be to stimulate the activity of local Committees, to see that they are fully supplied with all necessary information, and to secure as far as possible reasonable uniformity in standard between one district and another.Finance.137. It has been urged that the United Kingdom Government should be authorised to bear more than 50 per cent, (which is all that under present legislation they are able to bear) of the cost of the minimum adequate machinery for carrying out the work described in the preceding paragraphs. The following arguments have been put forward in support of this contention.(a) The 50-50 principle of the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, as applied to the work of the voluntary societies, has no logical foundation. Whilst it may be reasonable to lay down that, as between Government and Government, no scheme should be financed by the United Kingdom Government unless and until the oversea Government has manifested its desire to co-operate by providing half the cost, no such reason can be adduced in defence of the maintenance of the principle as between the United Kingdom Government and the charitable public.1 -
(b) The application in the past to the operations of the voluntary organisations (as to all other operations under the Empire Settlement Act) of the 50-50 provision has meant that the activities of the organisations were strictly limited by the amount of the subscriptions they were able to obtain from the general public.(c) In the case of migration, as in the case of other work previously carried out mainly or entirely by voluntary effort, the advent of the Government into the field of activity has a tendency to restrict the contributions of the philanthropic public.(d) In any event, so far as those organisations are con-cerned which are engaged in general social work and not solely in the work of migration, they may well hesitate to appeal to the public for special donations for the purpose of migration (thereby possibly diminishing the inflow of dona-tions for their general work) or to divert to migration funds subscribed primarily for other purposes.138. We are prepared, to admit the force of some of these arguments. At the same time, we are of the opinion that there are strong objections to the provision by the Government of the full cost of the migration work of the voluntary societies. For example, such an arrangement would tend to impair the voluntary nature of the organisations concerned. Eurthermore it would i leave them with no financial incentive to have regard to the prin-ciples of economy in administration. Moreover, all available experience tends to show not only that the philanthropic public like to subscribe towards objects in which they are interested, that their interest is keen in proportion to the extent of their subscription. Work of the kind we have described is work that needs behind it the impetus and inspiration which spring from the sense that it is real and valuable social service, and sense depends to a large degree upon the knowledge that the i public is sufficiently interested in the service in question to] subscribe towards it with reasonable liberality.139. We therefore recommend that the Empire Settlement Act! should be amended in such a manner as to allow the United j Kingdom Government to provide up to  75  per cent,  of minimum necessary cost of the migration work of approved toiuh-tary organisations as described in the previous paragraphs incrud-j ing the passage loans mentioned in paragraph 106, the travelling; organisers overseas referred to in paragraph 136, and the pro-1 vision of training in the United Kingdom for boys and singl women as suggested in paragraphs 156 and 157.140. On the other hand, there are certain arrangements in j connection with migration which we should regard it as propej and desirable that the voluntary organisations should finance,&apos;
some cases to the extent of 50 per cent., in some cases entirely, by means of subscriptions raised from the general public. As regards training overseas and the provision of scholarships, we have recommended elsewhere (see paragraphs 161 and 164 respec-tively) that the 50-50 principle as between the Government and the voluntary organisations should apply. In addition there are numerous supplementary activities, ranging from such matters as arrangements for farewell gatherings, or the gift of desirable but not strictly necessary articles of equipment up to the provision of facilities for capital investment by settlers in land or industry (see paragraph 125) which, in our opinion, come within the proper sphere of philanthropic, as distinct from governmental action, and would afford further scope for the fruitful employment of voluntary contributions by the public.141. In the general outline which we have given above of the functions of an approved voluntary organisation, we have dealt in some detail in paragraphs 133 and 134 with the type of organisation which appears to us to meet the needs of the case both at home and overseas. We do not, however, suggest that financial assistance by the United Kingdom Government should necessarily be confined solely to organisations of this type. Each application for assistance should be considered on its merits, with reference not only to the structure of the organisation con-cerned, but still more to the need for the special kind of work which it is capable of performing and to the efficiency with which it is likely to perform it.The importance of Co-ordination.142. We have already referred in paragraph 135 to the im-portance of avoiding any unnecessary overlapping in connection with the work of voluntary organisations. In this connection also we recommend that close attention should be paid to the desirability, in the interests of a proper economy and of efficiency, of reducing, whether by amalgamation or otherwise, the number of organisations operating in the field of migration to the lowest degree commensurate with the area of the field to be covered.Responsibility of Voluntary Organisations.143. We have left to the last one matter which we regard as of primary importance in connection with the work, as outlined above, of the voluntary organisations. If that work is to be successful, it is essential that the organisations engaged in it should command the confidence not only of the United Kingdom Government and of the Governments of the Dominions concerned, but also of the community here from which the migrants are to be drawn and of the community overseas among whom they are to be settled.     For this purpose it is of the greatest importance
that both the selection of the openings overseas to which migrants are to be sent and of the migrants from this country who are to fill them should be carried out by the organisations concerned with the fullest sense of responsibility. It is not to be expected, nor would it be desirable, that the oversea Government should divest itself of the responsibility for the final selection of those migrants towards whose passage and settlement it is contributing; but the fact that that responsibility is retained by the oversea Government should in no way be regarded as relieving the organisation concerned from taking all possible steps to ensure that the quality of the migrants settled under their auspices should not be open to criticism and that the information as to openings and prospects given on this side to intending migrants should be fully borne out when the migrants arrive at their destination. Nothing is so certain to injure the opportunity of a voluntary organisation to perform good work in the field of migration as any failure in either of these respects, and nothing will so enlarge that opportunity as a reputation, both here and overseas, for careful and successful work in the past.VI.-AFTERCARE, TRAINING, PUBLICITY, ETC. 1. AFTERCARE. General.144. In paragraph 47, we have expressed the view that as a general principle the migrant should from the earliest possible moment after his arrival overseas regard himself as a citizen of the country of settlement, and that it is equally desirable that, the Government and people of that country should regard the migrant from the first as a full citizen, dependent upon and responsible to his new Government and his fellow citizens alone for the rights and obligations of a citizen and neighbour. While, therefore, we do not overlook the fact that settlement in a new country is not an isolated act, but a continuing process which must take time, we consider that it would generally be sufficient that the migrant should be able to take advantage of the employment agencies, the various social services, the arrangements for land settlement and other facilities which are part of the normal machinery set up by Governments for the benefit of the community as a whole. In. cases under the nomination system, the migrant will naturally have the additional benefit of the guidance of his nominator.Single Women, Children and Juveniles.145. It is, however, generally accepted that in the case of single women, children and juveniles, additional provision is needed, both on the outward voyage and in connection with their reception, placement and aftercare overseas.
146. So far as the outward voyage is concerned, we recommend that in the future, as in the past, these migrants should travel in organised parties under the supervision of experienced conductors and/or conductresses.147. In the Dominions, provision should be made for reception centres at which the migrants can be accommodated on arrival. The nature of these centres will vary according to the arrangements to be made for further placement. In the case of single women and girls, for instance, the reception centre might be a residential hostel either at the port of arrival or in some other convenient town, where the migrants could remain if necessary for a few days until they secured suitable situations and to which they could return during periods of unemployment. In the case of children, the reception centre might be a Farm School on Fairbridge lines (see paragraph 121) or a hostel from which the children could be boarded out with selected families. In the case of boys the recep-tion centre might be a hostel at the port or other convenient town; or a farm, at which the boys could stay until they were ready to be placed in employment with approved farmers, and to which they could return, in case of necessity. Where the reception centre is a farm it would have the added advantage that facilities would be available for keeping the boy occupied on farm work in any interval before or between placements.148. Prior to placement, arrangements should be made for care-fnl enquiry as to the suitability of the situation, both from the point of view of the character of the employer, the accommodation avail-able, and the conditions of employment and wages. Where possible, these enquiries should be carried out by means of a visit of inspec-tion.149. In the case of children and juveniles, qualified inspectors would be required to follow up the migrants after they have been placed, and to ascertain by periodical visitation whether they are making good progress. The inspector should have authority to take such steps in the migrants&apos; interest, including replacement if necessary, as may seem to him desirable.Emergency Aitercare.150. While the above represent what in our opinion may be regarded as the minimum requirements in the mafter of aftercare, it must be remembered that during his early years in a new country, exceptional circumstances such as serious accident or pro-longed illness may arise in which the migrant may require special help. We hope that in the future as in the past such further help will be provided either by voluntary organisations interested in migration and settlement, or by ad hoc organisations such as the New Settlers&apos; Leagues in Australia, working in co-operation with the Oversea Government.
151. So far as concerns the normal facilities referred to in para-graph 144, which are available to all citizens in the Dominions, the question of a financial contribution by the United Kingdom Govern-ment does not arise. Inasmuch, however, as the special arrange-ments mentioned above for single women, children and juveniles, and the further help mentioned in paragraph 150 for migrants in general are additional to those provided for the community as a whole, and inasmuch as the United Kingdom Government cannot entirely dissociate themselves from the provision of such additional aftercare, it would seem proper that in such cases the United King-dom Government should make some financial contribution to the extra expenditure thus involved. We therefore recommend that where the additional machinery is provided by an oversea Govern-ment, the United Kingdom Government should co-operate up to the extent of 50 per cent. .of the cost, and where the provision is made by an approved voluntary or ad lioc organisation, up to the extent of 75 per cent.2. TRAINING.152. In the past, it has not been regarded as essential that intend-ing migrants should pass through a course of training before pro-ceeding to take up employment overseas. On the other hand, it has been thought desirable that training facilities should be available to a limited extent both in this country and overseas for certain types of migrants and contributions have accordingly been made by the United Kingdom Government either under the Empire Settle-merit Act or otherwise, towards the provision of such facilities, in the case of women wishing to engage in domestic work, and of families, single men, and boys, who were anxious to take up work on the land. Details of the various schemes are given in Appendix VIII.Training in the United Kingdom.153. The following are some of the considerations which may be urged in favour of the provision of training in the United Kingdom for intending settlers.(a) Training enables some applicants who would otherwise be rejected as unsuitable, to satisfy the requirements of the Dominion Governments and so proceed overseas.(b) The weeding-out process which also takes place daring the period of training prevents unsuitable migrants from pro-ceeding overseas and by their failure prejudicing the whole movement.(c) Training hostels tend to arouse public interest in, and stimulate the provision of money for migration, and are thus an excellent medium for publicity in connection with oversea settlement generally.
154. On the other hand,(a) Practical considerations have in. the past limited training to preparation for work on the land, except in the case of women, for whom training in domestic work was available. The same considerations will in our opinion apply in the future. It follows, however, from the view expressed by us in paragraphs 68 and 69 and elsewhere in this report, on the subject of land settlement in! general, that it is doubtful, whether a policy of directing adult migrants to work on the land to the exclusion of other occupations can be justified. These considerations do not, however, apply to boys, as to whom see paragraph 123.(b) It will be seen from Appendix VIII that the capital cost and maintenance expenditure of the various training centres in this country have in the past been considerable. Even in normal times, seasonal conditions in the Dominions make it difficult to arrange that migrants should proceed overseas from the training centres at regular intervals throughout the year. In these circumstances either the period of training must be unnecessarily prolonged, or the centres must remain empty during certain months. The result in either case is to increase the cost of training. Moreover, conditions overseas, such as a bad season or a change in political circumstances, may involve the closing down of training centres altogether at compara-tively short notice, with serious financial loss.(c) So far as families are concerned, the cost of providing them with even a rudimentary form of training in land work amounts on the average to  94 per family for a course of 16 weeks training. The cost of providing an adequate course of training which would effectively equip United Kingdom fami-lies for subsequent farm settlement overseas would necessarily be much greater. In this connection, it may be observed that such families as have been trained for work oh the land over-seas during the past ten years have been only -2 per cent, of the total number of families who are known to have proceeded overseas for such work, and it is therefore reasonable to assume that the migration of families has not been hindered in any real degree by shortage of training facilities.(d) The number of trainees who have actually proceeded overseas since the Empire Settlement Act was passed has been less than 5 per cent, of the total number of migrants assisted in the various categories, and of this 5 per cent, the number of otherwise unsuitable migrants who have been rendered suitable by the course of training has been very small.(e) There is little doubt that of those who are weeded out during the period of training in the United Kingdom the great majority would in any case have failed to obtain the approval of the Dominion authorities for the grant of assisted passages.
(/) Finally, the best training for migrants is undoubtedly that which is obtained by means of practical experience in the Dominion where they intend to settle.]55. On a balance of these considerations we have come to the conclusion that the grant of financial assistance by the United Kingdom Government towards the provision of training facilities in this country is not justified in the case of migrants in general. Special considerations arise, however, in the case of training centres for women and boys.Women and Boys.156. As to the desirability of encouraging the migration of women and boys, we need add nothing to what has been stated in para-graphs 114 and 123. We are of opinion that the provision of training would undoubtedly act as a stimulus to such migration when conditions are favourable overseas. It is true that of the women and boys who have gone as assisted migrants to ithe Dominions during the past ten years, the numbers who have passed through training centres in this country are small,* and while no doubt those who received training may have had an initial advan-tage over those who did not, we do not believe that those who received training have succeeded better in the long run than those who proceeded overseas without training. At the same time we have no doubt that the training provided in the past has been of some value in weeding outf those women and boys who are un-fitted or have a distaste for domestic work or farm work respec-tively, in enabling some women and boys to proceed overseas who would not otherwise have been able to satisfy Dominion standards, and particularly in giving greater confidence both to the trainees and to their parents. There is the further consideration that the provision of training centres for women and boys has been specially useful in arousing public interest in, and stimulating the provision of money for migration work generally.3 57. Practical considerations require that the training of boys should be limited to training for work on the land, and, as stated in paragraph 70, we doubt whether a policy of directing migrants to work on the land to the exclusion of other occupations can be justified. Nevertheless, as regards boys, four or five years work on the land is probably as good an introduction to life overseas as could be found.   Moreover, experience has shown that it is far* Of the total number of boys and women who have been assisted under the Empire Settlement Act, 14-4 per cent, of the boys and 2-3 per cent, of the single women household workers who proceeded overseas passed through training centres in the United Kingdom. Of this number a considerable proportion received less than eight weeks&apos; training.t Approximately 20 per cent, of the boys and 10 per cent, of the single women who entered the training centres were weeded out during the course of training.
*5 *5 T*hi ci O-easier for young men who have been some years in a Dominion than for those who are but newly arrived to find subsequent employ-merit there, whether in agriculture or in other occupations.158. With the above considerations in mind, we are of the opinion that the grant of some measure of financial assistance by the United Kingdom Government towards the provision of training facilities in this country for boys and single women would be justified.Finance.159. Where training centres are established in this country jointly by the United Kingdom Government and an oversea Govern-ment&quot; we recommend that the United Kingdom Government should be prepared to bear up to 50 per cent, of the capital and main-tenance costs, and that the administration should be entrusted to a suitable unofficial body on which both Governments would be represented. Where, however, such centres are established by approved voluntary societies or committees, and are administered and maintained by them to the satisfaction of the Government, we recommend that the Government should provide up to 75 per cent, of the capital cost of establishing new centres or enlarging and improving existing centres, as well as up to 75 per cent, of the cost of maintenance and training.Training Overseas.160. As regards training overseas, this has in the past been devoted entirely to agriculture and has varied in character from an extended training intended to make the trainee thoroughly efficient, to a limited course intended to give the newly arrived migrant a chance of learning something about local conditions before taking up regular work, whilst in some instances the training centres became little more than residential headquarters for the purpose of placement and aftercare. We have already stated our opinion that in the majority of cases, new migrants are in a position to gain their experience overseas more rapidly and effectively in actual employment than by means of training, and we do not therefore recommend any general measures of assistance by the United King-dom Government for training overseas.161. There are, however, special circumstances which make it desirable that some financial help should be rendered by the United Kingdom in connection with the training of young children over-seas at centres such as the Fairbridge Farm School in Western Australia (see paragraph 121). We are also of the opinion that in view of the exceptional conditions pertaining to settlement in Africa, there is justification for continuing the support hitherto given by the United Kingdom Government to the Tarka Bridge Training Farm in the Union of South Africa (as to which see Appendix VII), and to the arrangements in Southern Rhodesia for providing practical
training for approved migrants on the farms of already established settlers. We recommend that the United Kingdom Government should be prepared to contribute a sum not exceeding 50 per cent, of the cost of providing such facilities. We have dealt separately in paragraph 147 with the question of training at farm centres established overseas for the reception, placement and aftercare of boys.3. SCHOLARSHIP SCHEMES.162. In the past, provision has been made for scholarship schemes under the Empire Settlement Act for several categories of migrants, In the first place, teachers in the United Kingdom have been assisted to go to Canada with a view to taking up teaching appointments in that Dominion. In certain instances, the teachers have had to qualify by going through a short course of further training overseas, and scholarships have been allotted to enable them to undertake the required training. In addition, arrangements have been made in more recent years for young men and young women of suitable attainments to take their degree at a Dominion University, and a limited number of scholarships have been awarded for this purpose without any Government assistance. In other cases boys of secondary or public school education have been provided with scholarships to enable them to take short courses of training at agricultural colleges and schools overseas as a preliminary to being engaged on farm work.163. We consider that, generally speaking, the object of any scholarship scheme should be to give an opportunity for higher educational training in a Dominion to young men and young women from the United Kingdom who are likely to be qualified in later life to take up positions of influence overseas. Such young men and young women, on the completion of their course, would receive the same consideration in the matter of appointments as the native-born graduate. They would tend, we believe, in a degree out of all pro-portion to their numbers, to strengthen the social and cultural bonds between the Dominion and the Mother Country, and to stimulate migration from the United Kingdom to the Dominions of others like themselves. For these reasons we recommend that assistance should be given by the United Kingdom Government towards the provision of such scholarships.164. As regards the financial arrangements for scholarships on the above hues, we doubt whether oversea Governments would find it practicable to afford to migrants from the United Kingdom special educational facilities not provided for native-born students. The provision of such scholarships appears to us to be an activity especially suitable to patriotic and cultural societies, but we think that the efforts of such societies might be; stimulated and assisted by reasonable contributions from the United Kingdom Government. We believe that an annual expenditure by the United Kingdom
Government of the order of  5,000 in providing half the cost of scholarships of this kind would be well justified by its probable results.4. PUBLICITY.165. Publicity in connection with oversea settlement may be said to have begun so far as the United Kingdom Government is con-cerned, with the establishment in 1886 of the Emigrants&apos; Informa-tion Office, which was managed by a small unofficial Committee under the Chairmanship of an official of the Colonial Office. It made available to the general public accurate and up-to-date in-formation regarding conditions in other parts of the Empire, as well as in foreign countries. The functions of the Emigrants&apos; Information Office were absorbed by the Oversea Settlement Depart-ment on its formation in 1919. In 1925, a Sub-Committee of the Oversea Settlement Committee was appointed to deal with the question of publicity and in 1927, on the recommendation of this Sub-Committee, a Publicity Branch of the Oversea Settlement Department was formed in order to unify and develop the publicity work of the Oversea Settlement Department and the Society for the Oversea Settlement of British Women, and to co-operate with the Oversea Employment Branch of the Ministry of Labour.166. The publicity work in connection with migration which was subsequently undertaken by the Oversea Settlement Department came under three broad divisions : (i) The supply of accurate and up-to-date information to prospective settlers, both &quot; assisted &quot; and &quot; unassisted,&quot; on matters likely to affect them during their migration and settle-ment overseas.(ii) The development, through the schools, through social and other organisations and through the press, of general know-ledge of, and interest in, the various countries of the Empire.(hi) Propaganda with the object of the direct recruitment of settlers.167. With regard to (i), we are of the opinion that the publica-tion by the Oversea Settlement Department of handbooks and leaflets containing accurate information in regard to passage and other arrangements and general conditions in the Dominions and Colonies, as well as in foreign countries, should be continued in the future. Such information should be available to every migrant, whether assisted or unassisted, who desires to obtain it.168. With regard to (ii), we regard it as important that children m the schools should become familiar with general conditions in the countries of the Empire. We recommend that there should be effective co-operation in this respect between the Oversea Settle-reassessment  Department, the offices in this country of the representatives Dominion Governments and the educational authorities.   From
the point of view of the general public, we recommend that close contact should be maintained between the Department and the Press, and that when conditions again become favourable for migration, the arrangements formerly made by the Department for lectures, discussions, wireless talks, etc., on Empire subjects should be resumed and extended.169. With regard to (iii), the whole tendency of our report is to emphasise the fact that migration should properly be considered as a process of pulling, not pushing. Propaganda may easily become definitely a process of pushing, and we are of the opinion that such propaganda is generally undesirable. Where propaganda can be justified, it must obviously be. carried out with the greatest discretion. Even when it is not definitely misleading, it can be responsible for much disappointment and even suffering. There have undoubtedly been instances in the past of propaganda which exaggerated the prospects overseas, and some of the results of such propaganda have recently received a good deal of attention. For these reasons we feel that publicity should aim at the dissemination of full and reliable information as to opportunities overseas so that potential migrants may be in a position to form their own opinion as to their chances of settling successfully in the country concerned, It is clear that all propaganda from whatever source relating to settlement overseas will in the future require to be carefully watcher! by the Central Committee on Oversea Settlement to which we refer in paragraph 178. We recommend that for this purpose, this body should keep closely in touch with the responsible Dominion Authorities so that effective supervision may be maintained over any efforts in the United Kingdom to attract migrants.170. In the preceding paragraphs of this Keport, we have ei-pressed the general view that the most powerful stimulus to migra-tion is a&apos;state of prosperity in the Dominions overseas, bringing with it a demand for new population. The existence of favourable economic conditions overseas will in fact provide the greatest attracted-tion for new migrants and form the best kind of publicity for oversea settlement.VII. MACHINERY FOR THE FORMULATION AID ADMINISTRATION OF POLICY.GENERAL, CONSIDERATIONS.171. It seems to us that there are special considerations affect-ing the formulation and administration of migration policy whicl render it desirable that the Minister and Department primarily concerned should be assisted by external advice. The fact that;! our recommendations are accepted, such a policy will to a la? degree be carried out by non-governmental organisations would u itself, in our opinion, render it desirable that those organisation&apos;
should be associated with the Government in its administration. Moreover, in relation to a subject in which the public displays so close an interest, with regard to which new proposals are constantly being put forward, and which is concerned, in a very direct manner, with the future lives and happiness of many thousands of human beings, there is much to be said for the appointment, as advisers to the responsible Minister, of a body or bodies who can afford assurance to Parliament and to the public both that expert opinion from other than official sources is available to the Government in considering new proposals, and that administration by the Govern-ment and the responsible unofficial bodies is being properly co-ordinated.172. In fact from the beginning of direct intervention by govern-ment in migration in 1919, a committee composed partly of Ministers, partly of officials drawn from various Departments and partly of other persons has been associated more or less directly both with the formulation and administration of policy. The Committee was appointed &quot; in view of the need for creating machinery to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to deal effectively with the problems which are likely to arise during the period of reconstruction after the war &quot;,* and it appears never to have had any other terms of reference. A study of its records will show that it has at various times exercised the functions of an executive Committee or of an advisory Committee, or of both.173. We are of opinion that any body which is appointed in accordance with the suggestion in paragraph 171 should be purely advisory and that no executive functions should be assigned to it either by statute (as has from time to time been proposed) or otherwise. It is unlikely that Parliament or the public would ever be prepared effectively to relieve the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs of his responsibility for the day to day adminis-tration of the Oversea Settlement Department, and a Minister should not be placed in a position in which he is held responsible for the executive actions of a Committee which he cannot effectively control. On the other hand, a purely advisory body, if properly constituted, can be of great assistance in acting as a liaison between the Government and the public, and between the Government and the Voluntary Organisations, in keeping a watch upon the execu-tion and progress of approved schemes, and in bringing new ideas to notice and examining and reporting upon the schemes which are from time to time submitted to the Secretary of State or brought to the notice of Parliament or the public.174. The existing Oversea Settlement Committee has advised on both the formulation and the administration of migration policy. We are not convinced, however, that, in its present constitution, it is the best possible body for performing either function.   We* Cmd. 573, p. 2.
have endeavoured in this Eeport to give expression to the view that migration policy cannot be dealt with as a separate subject but is intimately associated with economic policy as a whole. It seems to us to follow that the Secretary of State, whilst continuing to be responsible for all matters relating to oversea settlement, should, on matters of policy as distinct from administration, be advised by a Committee some of whose members are selected with a view to their special experience of economics and finance. As regards the administration of policy, on the other hand, we think, for the reasons already stated, that the voluntary organisations should be represented on any Committee which may be appointed to assist the Secretary of State. Neither economics, finance, nor the voluntary organisations, as such, are represented on the Oversea Settlement Committee as at present constituted.175. Furthermore, in our opinion, a Committee whose function it is to advise on the economic and financial implications and possi-bilities of new schemes submitted to the Government is hardly appropriate for the consideration of detailed questions arising out of the day to day administration of such schemes when approved, nor on the other hand is a body whose duty it is to advise upon the administration of schemes necessarily well fitted to consider whether those schemes are well founded from the economic point of view.Need for two advisory bodies.176. In these circumstances we recommend that two advisory bodies should be set up, one to be known as the Oversea Settlement Board, the other as the Central Committee on Oversea Settlement, In order to secure a proper liaison between the two, they should have the same Chairman, and at least one other member in common, and the Secretary of the Oversea Settlement Department should be Secretary to both bodies. \The Oversea Settlement Board.177. The function of the Board should be to consider and advise the Secretary of State upon specific proposals for schemes of migra-tion within the Empire and upon any matter relating to Oversei Settlement which may be referred to it by him, and it should meet as often as may be required for this purpose. We recommend thai the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affair: should be Chairman of the Board and that the members should Ik one of the Assistant Under-Secretaries of State in the Dominion; Office, a representative of the Treasury and three persons nominat&quot; by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. The term of oft of the three members nominated by the Secretary of State shoal! be three years, but on the first appointment one such merota should be appointed for one year, one for two and one for three The nominated members should be eligible for re-appointment.
67236The Central Committee on Oversea Settlement.178. The function of the Committee should be primarily to pro-mote co-operation, through the voluntary organisations represented on it and through, the local Committees referred to in paragraphs 179 to 181, between the Government and the voluntary organisations and between the voluntary organisations themselves. It should, in our opinion, meet at regular intervals, and should have- before it a progress report from the Oversea Settlement Department. In addition it should be open to any member of the Committee to place on the Agenda any matter relating to the administration of migration policy. We recommend that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should be Chairman of the Committee and that the members should be one of the Assistant Under-Seeretaries of State in the Dominions Office as Vice-Chairman, a representative of the Treasury, a repre-Bentative of the Ministry of Labour, one representative of each of the main political parties, one representative of each approved voluntary organisation, two representatives of shipping, one repre-sentative of organised labour, and three other persons nominated by the Secretary of State, of whom at least one should be a woman. The three members nominated by the Secretary of State should be appointed on the same conditions as to term of office as the three nominated members of the Board.Local Organisation.179. Shortly before the rapid decrease in migration which set in about 1930, a number of local Committees had been formed, with the encouragement of the Oversea Settlement Committee, in cities or counties, for the purpose of stimulating and assisting migration within, their respective areas. Some of these Com-mittees confined their operations to the provision of publicity and information; others undertook actual recruiting; others, and these were the most active and successful, in addition to the activities mentioned above, established, financed, and maintained, with the assistance of grants from the Oversea Settlement Vote, local train-ing centres for boys or women.180. We are of opinion that, as and when migration revives, such local Committees may render services of great value, and their formation and activity, along lines which would no doubt be laid down by the Central Committee on Oversea Settlement, should therefore be encouraged. Their reasonable administrative expenses should, we think, be met out of public funds, and, as regards any other expenditure incurred by them in respect of train-ing and other matters in which we have recommended the grant of financial assistance by the United Kingdom Government, we recommend that they should be treated like other approved volun-tary organisations.
181. As regards the constitution and membership of such local Committees, we think it undesirable that we should attempt to make precise recommendations. This will be a matter for con-sideration by the Central Committee. Generally speaking, how-ever; we think that locab representatives of approved voluntary organisations should be members of such local Committees and we would call attention to the-possibility of associating with the work of the Committees some representatives of the Shipping Passenger Agents.The Importance of Co-ordination.182. We have referred.in paragraph 142 to the serious danger of overlapping and waste of effort which may be involved in the cover-ing of the same ground, either here or overseas, by more than one voluntary, organisation. We hope that, so far as this country is concerned, the danger of overlapping will to a large extent be avoided by the representation of the organisations concerned on the Central Committee. and on the local. Committees referred to above, an important part of whose work should be to co-ordinate all migration work within their area and to act, as it were, as a clearing house for such work. For a similar reason we should regard it as very desirable that similar local Committees, each covering: a substantial : area and including in their membership representatives of all the voluntary organisations operating in that area, should be established in the Dominions, and in. this con-nection we would call attention to the valuable work performed by the New Settlers Leagues in the Australian States in the past and recently by the British Settlers Welfare Committee established in New South Wales. If it could be arranged that all local inspection overseas should be carried out, for all the voluntary organisations concerned, by inspectors appointed by and responsible to such a local Committee, it is obvious that a very considerable saving of money and effort would be effected. We are conscious of the difficulties involved in this suggestion. We think, however, that payment of the full 75 per cent, contribution by the United Kingdom Government towards the cost of approved aftercare carried out overseas by voluntary or ad hoc organisations (see para-graph 151) should be made conditional upon the adoption of reasonable methods for the avoidance of overlapping.VIII.-FINANCE.183. In the preceding paragraphs of this Report we recommeri that financial assistance should normally be given by the Unite Kingdom Government towards the provision of the following :-,        (a) General reduced passage rates to Canada, Australia an New Zealand; paragraph 96.(b) Assisted passages; paragraphs 101 to 107.
&quot; 23?(c) Aftercare for single women, children and juveniles, and emergency aftercare for migrants generally; paragraph 151.(d) Training in the United Kingdom for women and boys;. paragraph 159.(e) The administrative expenses of approved voluntary organisations in connection with their migration work at home and overseas; paragraphs 139 and 140.(/) Special scholarship schemes; paragraphs 162 to 164. (g) Farm schools overseas on Fairbridge lines; paragraphs 121 and 122.184. It will also be remembered that in paragraph 75 we have suggested that in certain circumstances consideration should be given to the possibility of providing additional capital for Land Banks or other suitable institutions by means of advances   for   with the local Government concerned.185. It is difficult to make any reliable estimate of the cost to the United Kingdom Government of the services referred to above, but the general principles upon which we have based our recom-mendations are that as regards passages, the costs should be shared equally between Governments, or between the United Kingdom Government and some other organisation, and that as regards any other services, including passage loans, the costs should be shared equally as between Governments, and, save for the exceptions referred to in paragraph 140, in the proportion 75 :25 as between the United Kingdom Government and approved Voluntary Organisations.186. As regards (a) and (b) in paragraph 183, the expenditure will vary directly in proportion to the number of migrants assisted. As regards (c), (d), (e) and (g), part of the cost of these services will tend, in normal times, to be relatively constant. The other part will be variable, rising or falling in accordance with the num-ber of migrants for whom aftercare or training is provided. As regards (/), we have recommended expenditure of the order of  5,000 per annum on scholarship schemes. As regards paragraph 184, it is clearly impossible to make any estimate of expenditure for this service.187. With regard to (a) in paragraph 183, we have suggested in paragraph 94 that the general reduced rate to Canada should be in the region of  10,  12, or  14, according to destination, and that the general reduced rate to Australia and New Zealand should be in the region of  17 10s. On this basis the United Kingdom Governments share of the total cost of such rates would be on the average approximately  7 10s. per head.188. As regards assisted passages, we have recommended that such passages should be made available for nominated migrants, and we assume that the cost of such passages to the migrant will be
approximately the same as in the past (see Appendix V). We have also recommended that where necessary the provision of passage loans should be continued. As we have stated in paragraph 62 (ii), a high proportion of the loans made under the Empire Settlement Act has been recovered. We estimate the cost to the United Kingdom Government of assisted passages at approximately  10 per head.189. With regard to (c) in paragraph 183, we have recommended that a contribution should be made by the United Kingdom Govern-ment towards the cost of providing the additional aftercare which is considered necessary in the case of single women, children and juveniles. We estimate that the cost to the United Kingdom Govern-ment of providing such additional aftercare in normal times, and of making provision for the cost of the emergency aftercare which we recommend in paragraph 150, would be approximately  15 per head.190. In regard to (d) in paragraph 183, we recommend that the United Kingdom Government should contribute towards the pro-vision of facilities for the training in the United Kingdom of single women and boys, and that the United Kingdom contribution should be up to 75 per cent, of the cost where such training is provided in co-operation with an approved Voluntary Organisa-tion, and 50 per cent, where the training is provided in co-operation with an oversea Government. On this basis, the cost to the United Kingdom Government of such training would be approximately  15 for each migrant who receives training.191. In regard to (e) in paragraph 183, we have recommended that the United Kingdom Government should contribute up to 75 per cent, of the expenses of approved voluntary organisations at home and overseas. In a normal year, we estimate the cost to the United Kingdom of assisting such approved voluntary organisations at not less than  50,000 per annum.192. In regard to (q) in paragraph 183, we have recommended that provision- should be made for the establishment and mainten-ance of additional Farm Schools on Fairbridge lines in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It is estimated that the capital cost of establishing each such farm school would be of the order of  30,000. On the assumption that the respective oversea Govern-ments will co-operate in such schemes with the United Kingdom Government and the Voluntary Society concerned, we estimate that the United Kingdom Government proportion of the capital cost of establishing each such farm school, with accommodation for 300 children at a time which is an efficient economic unit would be not more than  10,000, whilst the United Kingdom Governments contribution towards the cost .of maintenance should not exceed 5s. per week per child over a period of not more than five years, or an average cost of approximately  12 per head per annum.
193. We find it impossible to estimate what the effect on the flow of migration to the Dominions is likely to be if our recom-mendations are carried out, but assuming that economic conditions will become increasingly favourable to a resumption of migration, we see no reason to suppose that the movement may not at least approach the level reached in the most favourable years of the last decade. On the basis of the recommendations contained in this Eeport, the expenditure by the United Kingdom Government on the various services mentioned above may be estimated at approxi-mately  1,100,000 for 100,000 assisted migrants.Unemployment Insurance and Migration.194. It is constantly urged by the promoters of large scale schemes of land settlement overseas that such schemes would relieve the unemployment situation in the United Kingdom and could there-fore be financed out of the resultant savings in respect of Unemploy-ment Insurance expenditure. The argument that the Fund will gain owing to the migration of particular individuals (and might therefore be called on to pay the whole or part of this prospective gain in aid of migration) assumes that migrants, had they remained in this country, would, on the average, have drawn out more in benefit than they (with their employers and the Exchequer) would have paid in contributions. There is no reason&quot; to suppose that this would be so. And even if it were so, it would not follow that the Fund ought to make the suggested payments. There are many other methods besides migration by which the prospects of employ-ment of particular individuals may be improved. Clearly the Fund cannot be called upon to subsidise all these methods, and there is in our opinion no sufficient reason why migration should be selected for special treatment. Indeed, we think there would be a special objection, because the result would inevitably be to create the impression in the Dominions that our object is to relieve our un-employment position at their expense. A note on the subject will be found in Appendix IX.IX.-CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY OFPRINCIPAL RECOMMENDATIONS.195. We are conscious that this Report may disappoint some cf those who have devoted much time and have rendered services of great value to the cause of Empire Settlement. That it is urgently desirable, from the point of view of the United Kingdom, of the individual Dominions concerned, and of the Empire as a whole, that there should be a better distribution of the white population of the Empire is generally agreed. The situation is one which might appear to call for heroic remedies. This Keport proposes no such remedies. On the contrary it suggests that the basis of some of the more ambitious proposals recently put forward is economically unsound.
196. In support of the less ambitious, but in our view more fruitful proposals made in our Report, we invite attention to two considerations which seem to us to be of paramount importance. First, the question of migration cannot be considered in isolation from the general economic conditions with which it is inextricably interwoven. There is no foundation for any idea that because there may be, at the moment, a surplus population in this country, and vast areas of unoccupied land in some of the Dominions, a simple act of transference of the former to the latter will of itself solve the problems involved. There must be such economic conditions and prospects in the country of settlement as are calculated to pro-vide a livelihood for the newcomers. If it is argued that, under some of the schemes now under consideration, the newcomers would carry fresh capital with them into their new home, we would reply that capital cannot at any time produce prosperity, unless the other conditions which make prosperity possible are present.197. The history of migration in modern times proves that migra-tion is a symptom of prosperity and not a cure for depression. The real stimulus to -the individual to migrate is the hope of securing a better standard of living overseas. The right line of approach to a more desirable redistribution of the white population of the Em-pire, therefore, is not to endeavour to transfer men and women from the United Kingdom overseas regardless of economic conditions such as the possibility of marketing their produce, and to maintain them there until (if ever) they are in a position to maintain them-selves, but to do all that lies in our power to assist in creating the conditions overseas which have in the past provoked and will in the future provoke a large volume of spontaneous migration, and then to see that every obstacle which lies in the way of such migration is removed and that every facility which can increase it is provided. This is the line which we have endeavoured to follow in our Report.198. The second consideration is that, in examining this ques-tion, we should retain some sense of proportion. Schemes for settling many thousands of families overseas in new communities, involving as they may do the chartering of ships, the building cf ports and railways, the construction of roads, the selection of a balanced population containing the right number of agriculturalists, tradesmen, professional men and others, the co-operative buying and selling of all that the new communities will need or produce, and the writing of new names on the map tend to impress the public by the magnitude of the organisation involved, of the sums to be expended and of the results, in new towns overseas, which they promise. There is nothing spectacular, on the other hand, in the idea of an individual father of a family walking into a passenger agenfs office, producing a voucher for a nominated passage for him-self and his family, and sailing overseas to try his luck in an opening secured for him by a friend or relative who has previously done the same.  It seems to us, however, that the relative merits of these two
lines of approach, must be judged by results. We find it very difficult to believe that organised group settlement could deal with, at the most, more than 2,500 families say, 10,000 souls in a year; neither the localities, nor the capital, nor the administrative capacity for anything in excess of this or perhaps for anything as large as this are available. There are, however, no limits, other than the absorptive capacity of the Empire overseas, to the magnitude of the stream of migration which may be.produced by the other method. It was by this method that, in the ten years immediately preceding the war, over 148,000 migrants* annually left the United Kingdom and settled in the oversea parts of the Empire. In the ten years 1919-1928, the annual average migration produced by this method was over 132,000. We are convinced that it will be by this method, individualistic, and therefore congenial to our national bent, that the great bulk of migration from this country will always take place; and that it is by stimulating and assisting individual migration of this kind in every possible way that a really large volume of success-ful migration will, in the future, be produced.Summary of Principal Recommendations.199. (1) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should continue to be the Minister responsible for all matters relating to oversea settlement (para. 173).(2) The United Kingdom Government should only assist migra-tion when conditions are favourable to satisfactory settlement (para. 25) and when the Oversea Governments are prepared to receive new migrants and to join in the arrangements necessary to give them a real prospect of success (para. 52).(3) The financial burden of any assistance should be equitably shared between the United Kingdom and the Dominions (para. 53).(4) The Empire Settlement Act, 1922, should be amended so as to allow the United Kingdom Government to provide up to 75 per cent, of the necessary cost of the migration work of approved voluntary organisations (para. 139).(5) The Oversea Settlement Commititee as at present constituted should be replaced by two advisory bodies, (i) The Oversea, Settle-ment Board, to advise the Secretary of State on specific migration proposals (para. 177); (ii) The Central Committee on Oversea Settlement, to co-ordinate the administration of migration policy particularly in connection with the work of the Voluntary Organisa-ftions (para. 178), including the local Migration Committees (para. 179).(6) The formation of local migration committees should be encouraged (para. 180).See note to paragraph 85. Calculated according to the ratio of migrants to passengers since 1912.
(7) Subject to the exceptions in the following paragraph the United Kingdom Government should discontinue the policy of pro-viding capital for land settlement whether by direct advances to migrants (para. 70) or by a guarantee of capital and interest (para. 74), and no special assistance should be given by the United Kingdom to schemes for group settlement (para. 85).(8) Where however land settlement prospects are favourable but migrants are unable to obtain capital on economic terms, the United Kingdom Government should be prepared to consider the possibility of the loan to a suitable institution, preferably a Government&apos; Agricultural Bank or a Co-operative Bank, of additional capital for this purpose on a   for   basis with the local Governments (para. 75). In the exceptional circumstances mentioned in para. 93 the grant of special assistance for land settlement should be con-sidered on its merits.(9) The United Kingdom Government should provide assistance within certain limits towards general reduced passage rates to the Dominions (paras. 95 to 97).(10) Every endeavour should be made to encourage the nomina-tion system and to arrange with the Canadian Government for its extension to all categories of migrants (paras. 102 to 105). Specially favourable nominated rates should be provided for families (para. Ill), single women (para. 115), and juveniles (para. 123), and free passages should be provided for children (para. 116).- i ....    .(11) Passage loans should be made available for those nominated migrants who cannot afford to pay the full nominated rate (para. 106).(12) No financial contribution should be made by the United Kingdom Government towards the provision of cheap return passages from the Dominions (para. 98).(13) Experiments in connection with cottage schemes should be continued on a small scale when conditions are favourable (para. 113).(14) The Canadian Government should be approached with a view to considering the re-introduction under proper safeguards of the system of boarding-out young children (para. 120).(15) The establishment of further farm Schools on Fairbridge lines should be encouraged and the United Kingdom Government should be prepared to make a contribution towards the capital cost and maintenance expenditure of such Farm Schools (para. 122).(16) Training facilities should be made available in the United Kingdom for single women and boys (para. 158). The United Kingdom Government should bear up to 50 per cent, of the capital and maintenance costs of training centres where they are estab-lished jointly with an oversea Government, and up to 75 per cent, where they are established by approved voluntary societies (para. 159).
(17) Assistance should be granted towards the provision of special training arrangements in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia (para. 161) and of scholarships in the Dominions for certain special types of migrant (para. 164). ,Malcolm MaoDonald (Chairman).

In the case of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, statistics show that up to a recent period the annual average rate of increase of population in these Dominions has been approximately 2 per cent, per annum, and that in the case of Australia, this average rate, consisting as to -55 per cent, of net immigration, and 1-45 per cent, natural increase (by excess of births over deaths), has been uniform over a period of 64 years (from 1860 to 1924).In the 40 years from 1881 to 1921, the population of New Zealand in-creased at a net rate of 2-3 per cent.; of Australia at 2-2 per cent.; of United States of America 1-9 per cent.; and of Canada 1-8 per cent.
The following tables show the net rates of increase in the three Dominions mentioned above in the years 1910 and 1928 and in the United States in the years 1880, 1910, 1920 and 1928.

Governments in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth op Australia see para. 43The only example of a development scheme arranged under the Empire Settlement Act is the Migration and Settlement Agreement negotiated in 1925 with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia. Under this Agreement (usually known as the  34,000,000 Agreement)* the Commonwealth Government undertook to raise loans not exceeding in the aggregate  34,000,000 (including the loans not exceeding  14,000,000 pro-vided for under Land Settlement Agreements arranged at an earlier date with the States of Victoria, New South &quot;Wales and Western Australia), and to issue the proceeds to the State Governments at a very low rate of interest for expenditure upon approved schemes of development which, tended directly or indirectly to increase the opportunities for the settlement of persons from the United Kingdom. The methods by which the development was to be carried out included the acquisition, resumption and clearing of land suit-able for farms; advances to settlers for the purchase of stock and equip-ment, etc.; advances to farmers for the erection of cottages for employees; farm settlement; afforestation; construction of public works, e.g., railways, roads, bridges, irrigation and hydro-electric works, irrigation farms; and* It has been decided to terminate this agreement and no further commitments will be incurred under it.
similar enterprises tending to assist development in rural areas. The. Agree-ment aimed at the satisfactory settlement in Australia of 450,000 persons from the United Kingdom within ten years.The contribution of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom took the form of a payment of  150,000 for every  750,000 of loan money issued by the Commonwealth Government and expended by the State Governments on approved schemes. This contribution (which was payable one year after the issue of the relative loan to the State Government con-cerned) was approximately equivalent to one-half of the interest on the loan money for a period of 10 years.For every loan of  750,000 expended upon approved development schemes, the State Government concerned undertook that 10,000 assisted migrants should be satisfactorily settled within the State within ten years. In respect of approved land settlement schemes under the Agreement the obligation of the State iwas to absorb somewhere within the State one family of four per-sons for every farm created.Schemes estimated to cost in all  8,731,254 (including expenditure in respect of the loans provided for the land settlement schemes in Victoria and Western Australia amounting to  2,322,518) were approved under the  34,000,000 Agreement, and the total liability incurred by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in respect of their contribution towards loans actually issued by the Commonwealth Government to the State Govern-ments amounted at the 31st December, 1933, to  1,481,083.The following table gives particulars of all the schemes approved under tie Agreement:

The system is widely used through-out Australia and New Zealand, and to some extent in Canada, where it is known as share-renting.   The general basis on which the system is operated is that of a partnership, with the landowner as a sleeping partner.   A usual basis of partnership is for the landowner to provide the land, accommoda-tion, implements, and/or stock, and half the seed and manure, and for the [ share farmer to provide all the labour, half the seed and half the manure. When the crop is harvested and sold, the proceeds are shared on a previously I agreed basis in accordance with the respective contributions of the taw J parties.    As a general rule, share-farming agreements are limited to year&apos;s operations, but in some cases they extend over longer periods,   xln I system can be adapted for use in nearly all types of farming.In Australia, it has been estimated that share-farming on a third share I basis can be carried out on wheat and mixed farms with from  100 to  129 [ capital.   Proportionately more capital is necessary where the share of farmer is greater.
A variation of the normal system in Australia is provided in what is known as Bonus Share Farming, under which the land owner pa3&apos;s&apos; a small wage and sustenance and gives a 5 per cent, or 10 per cent, bonus on the nett results of the farm operations, either in wheat or in cash. The bonus received is banked as the nucleus of the share farmer&apos;s future capital.These systems have in the past enabled numbers of thrifty young men who have saved money from their wages to build up a capital fund for the sub-sequent acquisition of their own farms.APPENDIX VII. See para. 129(a) The 1820 Memorial Settlers&apos; association the object of the Association is to arrange for the settlement in South Africa of suitable persons with substantial capital. The main avenues of settlement are upon the land, though in a limited number of cases other openings may be available.The Association, which has no interest in the sale of real estate, has a training farm at Tarka Bridge in the Cape Province, and also makes arrangements with established farmers throughout the Union to train prospective settlers. After undergoing their course of training, settlers are given disinterested advice and help in regard to the acquisition of suitable farming  propositions.The Association was formed to commemorate the settlement in South Africa in 1820 of some 3,000 United Kingdom settlers whose descendants in the Union are now estimated to number more than 150,000. In the last 12 years 6,500 persons have proceeded to  South Africa under itsauspices.(b) The Fellowship of the Maple LeafThis Society has in the past arranged for the placement of school teachers, doctors, nurses and social workers from the United Kingdom in Western Canada. In 1930 arrangements were also made for the training in Sydney of six men intending to take employment as school teachers in New South Wales. During the 12 years ending 1931, 578 teachers alone went overseas under the auspices of the Fellowship, many of them for work in remote districts of Canada. A scheme for enabling voluntary workers from the United Kingdom to establish social centres in the outlying parts of Western Canada has recently been started by the Fellowship.(c) The Anglo-Canadian Education committee this Committee was formed in 1930 to encourage suitable youths from the Public and Secondary Schools of the United Kingdom to take their degree course at a Canadian University, in preparation for their entry into the life of the Dominion. To assist in this work, a number of scholarships have been provided at Canadian Universities. As a result of the Com-mittee&apos;s activities, 41 youths from the United Kingdom entered Canadian Universities during the years 1930-32.
APPENDIX VIIITraining Schemes under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 see para. 152 I. Training in the United Kingdom Schemes were arranged with the following organisations for providing training and testing for boys in farm work with a view to their settlement on the land in the Dominions:  (a) Boys Salvation Army.Cossar Boys&apos; Training Earms.Church Army.Church of England Waifs and Strays Society. Dr. Barnardo&apos;s Homes. Mr. Fegan&apos;s Homes. Church of Scotland. Glasgow Parish Council.In addition, schemes were arranged with the Corporations of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Liverpool and Bristol, through the local Migration Committees concerned, and with the local Migration Committee at Hull, for providing training for boys proceeding to farm work in Canada and Australia.(b) Single Men Hudson&apos;s Bay Company. Church of Scotland. Glasgow Parish Council.In addition, a number of schemes were arranged by the Ministry of Labour outside the Empire Settlement Act for the training of young men at farm centres in various parts of the United Kingdom with a view to their migration to Canada and Australia.(c) Single WomenA scheme was entered into with the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, under which training was provided for suitable single women at Market Harborough in Leicestershire, with a view to their employment in household work in Australia. The centre was afterwards taken over by the Society for the Oversea Settlement of British Women for training women for household work in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.Schemes were arranged with the Scottish Council for Women&apos;s Trades and Careers and with the Y.M.C.A. for the provision of domestic training for women proceeding to household work in the Dominions. In addition, schemes were arranged in conjunction with the Ministry of Labour for training in household work at centres at Newcastle, Cardiff, London and Edinburgh. A scheme was also arranged with Dr. Barnardo&apos;s Homes for providing training in domestic work for girls intending to settle in tie Dominions.(d) FamiliesThe War Office provided preliminary training at the Army Vocational Training Centres at Catterick and Chiseldon for families intending to settle on the land overseas.Schemes were also arranged by the Salvation Army, for training families for settlement in Australia, and by the British Legion for the training of families for farm work and for their subsequent settlement in Canada.II. Training Overseas (i) Canada.   Provincial Government Reception Farms for BoysSchemes were arranged with the Provincial Governments of Ontarit, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and British Columbia under whict these Governments provided farms where boys were given instruction u local farm work until they were placed in employment with selected farmers.
(ii) AustraliaA number of schemes arranged by the Governments of the Australian States provided for the training of boy migrants in farm work and for their subsequent placement.Schemes were also arranged by the Salvation Army for the training of hoys at their farm at Riverview in Australia.(iii) New ZealandA scheme was arranged by the Acknowledgment of the Debt to British Seamen Fund for the training at Flock House, and the subsequent settlement on the land of boys and girls, the eons and daughters of British Seamen.A scheme was also arranged by the Salvation Army for the training of boys for farm work at Putaruru, in New Zealand.(iv) Union of South AfricaA contribution was made by the United Kingdom Government towards the cost of the instructional staff of two Training Farms established in South Africa; by the 1820 Memorial Settlers&apos; Association. Owing to a decrease in the number of settlers for training one of the farms has been closed down as from January 1st, 1931.Contributions were also made in co-operation with the Society for the Oversea Settlement of British Women towards the cost of training at a private farm in the Orange Free State for women (anxious to farm in South Africa. Only 4 women have taken advantage of this scheme since it came into operation in 1929.(v) Southern RhodesiaA scheme was arranged with the Government of Southern Rhodesia for providing a preliminary training for intending settlers under the Government Land Settlement schemes.With the exception of (iv) above, the operation of all schemes of training has now ceased.The following table gives the numbers trained in the United Kingdom under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 :-&apos; .Category.

Rhodesia, and approximately^ 4,800 boys trained in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The cost of training overseas was  42,000.* Approximately 800 of these boys are included in the 8,092 boys trained in the mted Kingdom before sailing.
APPENDIX IXProposals to Utilise the Unemployment Fund pop. Purposes op Migration and Settlement Overseas see para. 194The proposal has frequently been made that it would be an advantage to capitalise a man&apos;s future claims to Unemployment Benefit in order that he may have a sum of money with which to set up on his own account, or in partnership, in one of the Dominions overseas.There are many weighty objections to any proposal to use the Unemploy-ment Fund for any purpose other than that for which it was established, viz., to make payments to unemployed persons to enable them to tide over the period of unemployment. The Fund is maintained out of contributions from employed persons, their employers and the Exchequer in equal propor-tions, and these contributions are paid for the specific purpose just men-tioned. If it were decided to use the money so obtained for the purpose of assisting migration, it would be difficult to resist requests for using it for many other purposes, such as to subsidise wages or to enable a man to set up on his own account in this country. Whether it is desirable or not that public moneys should be used for such purposes, it would clearly be improper to use a Fund established for the specific purpose of paying benefit to unem-ployed persons, and the existence of the Unemployment Fund is really irrelevant to the question whether public money should be provided to enable people to set up as farmers, manufacturers, shopkeepers, etc., either in this country or overseas.It has been urged that it would not be improper to use the Unemployment Fund for the above purposes because a person who was enabled to set up on his own account, say, in Australia, would not in future be a charge on tie Unemployment Fund and that there would, therefore, be no loss to the Fund in paying him a lump sum in lieu of weekly payments of benefit in the future. This argument is fallacious; it is apparently based on the view that there is a &quot; standing army &quot; of some two million people who are perpetually unem-ployed and maintained out of the Unemployment Fund. There is, however, no such &quot; standing army &quot;. Out of an insured population of some twelve and a half millions, some six million may claim Unemployment Benefit at one time or other1 in the course of the year, but many of these remain un-&apos; employed for only very brief periods. Of the approximately two million people unemployed at the end of December, 1933, only approximately 400,000 had at that date been unemployed for a year or more. The individuals on the Unemployed Register are constantly changing and many of those uncm-ployed at the end of December are now in employment.It is thus clear that the personnel of the unemployed changes fairly rapidly, and, apart from a few industries that have suffered exceptional depression during recent years, there is no reason to suppose that a person who is unemployed this week will be unemployed this time next year or even in three months&apos; time. Even if one has regard only to the depressed industries, it is not justifiable to assume that unemployment will always remain at its present level. Indeed there have been signs of improvement in some of the heavy industries that have suffered most persistently from unemployment, and the reduction in the total number of the unemployed during 1933 was due to a not inconsiderable extent to an improvement in what have been known for some time as &quot; the depressed industries &quot;.The only way of arriving at the capital value of an individual jman&apos;s future claims to Unemployment Benefit is to take an average, based on Iris expectation of life, the likelihood of his becoming unemployed in the future, and any other relevant actuarial considerations. It is, however, provided in the Unemployment Bill now before Parliament that the Unemployment Fund shall be kept balanced, that is to say. its annual expenditure shall It met out of its annual income (subject to necessary adjustments to meet
temporary emergencies). It follows, therefore, that, on the average, an insured person will attract into the Unemployment Fund in the course of his insured life enough money to pay for the whole of the benefit he will ever draw.But it may be contended that it would be legitimate for the Unemployment Fund to make a contribution to assist the migration of men whose expecta-tion of unemployment is much greater than the average expectation. It would, of course, be possible to select men in such industries as coal-mining and shipbuilding which have been severely hit by the trade depression, particularly elderly miners and unskilled workmen, who have very little prospect of an early return to work. There are indeed many such men in South Wales, on the North-east coast, and in some of the other &quot; depressed &quot; areas, whose prospects of re-entering industry are very poor. Few, if any, of the men who could be identified as belonging to this class have, however, any claim on the Unemployment Fund. The first condition for the receipt of Unemployment benefit is that the claimant must have paid 30 contributions within the last two years; in other words, his continuous unemployment must not have exceeded 74 weeks. Moreover, it is doubtful whether a large proportion of the men in question would satisfy the requirements of the Dominion Authorities; very many of them are middle-aged men who have had little or no work; for a long time and, although they may be men of good character and highly skilled in their own trade, they might not have the enterprise and adaptability necessary to make successful settlers in a new country.A class of men who might possibly make good settlers and whose migration overseas might be a relief to public funds in this country, but not as a rule to the Unemployment Fund, is that of the young men in such districts as the depressed coal-mining valleys of South Wales, who have had no oppor-tunity of obtaining regular work since they left school. Many of the more enterprising youths from these districts have found work in other parts of the United Kingdom, but there are many who have been unable to do this and who have little immediate prospect of employment. If such men ought to be assisted to migrate the money for the purpose should not be provided from the Unemployment Fund since the men have at present little expecta-tion of drawing unemployment benefit if they remain in this country.(9/34) (26338D   Wt. 2192-1392 250 11/34 P St.  q, 373
