4 c-j Qdocument is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)CRET. Copy No --                                   CABINET.. 57  (35)COUNTERFEITING CURRENCY (CONVENTION)  BILL.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and by the _Secretary of State for Scotland ._We desire to obtain Cabinet authority for the introduction of a Bill to amend the law relating to the counterfeiting of currency.      This legislation is required to enable His Majesty&apos;a Government to ratify an International Convention signed at Geneva in 1929.In 1926 the French Government drew the attention of the Secretary of the League of Nations  to recent instances in which the currency of one country had been forged in another and to the danger of those occurrences, not only to the credit of the Injured country,  but also to friendly international relations.      The notorious case of the  forgery of French bank notes in Hungary gave point to the French complaint.      The French Government&apos; suggested that there  should be an international convention for the suppression of counterfeiting.Other Governments were agreeable to this course, including the British Government.      The Bank cf England is one of the worst sufferers from the  counterfeiting of notes abroad.After preliminary negotiations a Conference was  called at Geneva in 1929 and an International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency was signed by the delegates of all the countries invited to the Conference,   including the United States  of America and Russia.The main provisions of the Convention are -(i) that the counterfeiting of currency should be a crime;(ii) that the counterfeiting of the  currency of a foreign
state should &quot;be punishable as severely as the counter-feiting of domestic currency;(iii) that counterfeiting offences should be crimes for which extradition can be obtained;(iv) that in each country the investigation of counterfeiting should be organised by a central office and that the central offices of the various countries should be in direct communication with each other.The administrative requirements of the Convention involve little,  if any,   change in present practice.     New Scotland Yard will act as the central office.English and Scots law are already for the most part in conformity with the legal proposals in the Convention, but amendment of the law will be required in the following respects -(a) Offences in respect of foreign currency should be made punishable with the same penalties as the corresponding offences in respect of domestic currency.      At present the latter are punishable more severely.(b) Counterfeit currency shonald after the of fender&apos;s prosecution be returned on request to the State or bank whose currency is forged.(c) Attempts to counterfeit;.currency&apos; should, be extradition crimes.     At present extradition can only be granted in respect of offences of counterfeiting,  if they are substantive offences .A Bill to amend the law in these respects has been drafted.     As the Extradition Acts extend to the Dominions and Colonies as well as  to this country,  it was necessary to consult the Dominions to which section 4 of the Statute of Westminster does not apply (namely, Australia, New Zealand and Newfoundland)
about the amendment in extradition law referred to above. The concurrence of these Dominions and of the Secretary of State for the Colonies and of Northern Ireland has been obtained .It is not anticipated that the Bill -will be in any way controversial and it might suitably be introduced in the House of Lords .If the Cabinet approve, we shall submit a draft of the Bill to the Home Affairs Committee....   J .G . G.P.C.15th March,  1955
