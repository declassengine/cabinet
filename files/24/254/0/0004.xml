At their Meeting on 19th December,, 1954 (Cabinet47 (34) Conclusion 17)  the Cabinet were informed that a Bill relating to Rational Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions  should be introduced during 1935, and agreed to approve the proposal that a Cabinet Committee should be appointed to examine the question and report to the Cabinet. The composition of the Committee was subsequently settled as followsThe Chancellor of the Exchequer (in the Chair)0 The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. The Secretary of State for Scotland, The Minister of Health. The Minister of Labour. The Postmaster General,2. A Memorandum summarising the  questions for considera-tion has been circulated to the Committee by the Minister of Health.      This Memorandum, the terms of which have been agreed between the Treasury,  the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland,  is appended to this Report.        Attached to it will be found separate memoranda A,B,C9D,and E elaborating the various questions and making suggestions for their solution.,3. The Committee have carefully examined these  questions3.and submit to the Cabinet the following conclusions and recommendations in regard to them,
Memorandum A._Quest ions (l) and (id).(l) Is the increase in contributions due to take effect on 1st January, 1936, to be allowed to operate?(2) If this increase is to be brought intooperation is it possible to mace any set-off by a concurrent decrease of the unemployment insurance contribution?Under Section 43 of the Contributory Pensions Act 1925,  the weekly contribution for pensions is to be increased by 2d.  for men and Id.  for women as from 1st January,  1936.      Particulars of the contributions to the Social Insurance Schemes will be found on page 5 of the Appendix.If the Section is allowed to operate the Contributory Pensions Fund will continue to show annual surpluses during the decennium ending 31st March,  1946 (see Column 1 of Tables A and B of Memorandum a).      If, however,  the Section is not allowed to operate, a very heavy burden in the form of additional contributions will be placed on the Exchequer.    For example, the additional Exchequer con-tributicns required in this event to meet the expendi-ture up to the end of the  second decennium,  i.e.  31st March, 1946, will amount in all to  50,100,000,  on the basis of Table A, while on the more favourable assumption as to the course of unemployment adopted in Table B,  this figure will amount to  45,000,000. Moreover, the negative answer to Question (l) might have very serious repercussions on the later increases of contributions falling to be made under the Act of 1925 in 1946 and 1956 respectively.    The effect might well be to upset the whole finance of the scheme and to impose an extremely grievous burden on the Exchequer. Probably very few employers or employed realise that, unless Parliament otherwise determines, increased contributions will come into operation on 1st January,
1936. The situation will be greatly eased if the increase could be set off by a concurrent decrease of the Unemploy-is briefly as follows,Under the Unemployment Act 3  19349 the Minister of Labour is precluded from making alterations in rates of contribution and benefit without first obtaining a report from the Unemployment -Insurance Statutory Committee re-commending the alteration and certifying that it can be made without endangering the solvency of the Fund.      The Statutory Committee have recently reported on the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund as on 31st December last. The Committee say that tney are unable to report that the Unemployment Fund is likely to be more than reasonably sufficient to discharge its liabilities.      They propose $ however^ to make a further report .y if possible, in May next when they have had further experience of tiie rate of unemployment9 and opportunities of ascertaining the future prospects of unemployment.While  it would not be safe to count on the StatutoryCommittee being able in May next to recommend a reduction of the Unemployment Insurance contributiong the Statutory Committee fully realise the importance of easing the situation in January next by a decrease in that contri-buticn.      The Committee submit conclusions on Questions (1) and (2) as follows(a) That the answer to Question (2)  cannot be given until the further Report and Recommendations of the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee have been received by the Minister of Labour,,(b) (provisionally)  that the answer to Question (l)  should be in the affirmative, i.e.   the increase in contributions due to tatce effect on 1st January, 19369  should be allowed to operate, but that this conclusion may have to be re-examined when the Report and Recommendations of the Statutory Committee are available.ment Insurance Contribution.The position in this respect
RTision ;s of!gbt aUing out Insurance31stcember, 1935,Memorandum B0__Question (3).Are the persons, estimated to number 200,000 who are due to go out of pensions insurance on 31st December,  1935,  to be allowed to lose all pension rights on that date or should some means be found for a reasonable protection of these rights during unemployment?The Committee think that the first part of thisquestion should be answered in the negative and the second part in the affirmative, and they have agreed to recommend the Cabinet to adopt the following scheme for dealing withthe matter submitted to them by the Ministry of health and the Department of Health for. Scotland.Draft of New Scheme to Cover both Health and Pensions Insurance.(Submitted by the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for SGotland),A. On ceasing to be insurably employed all insuredpersons to have (as at present under Section 3(1) of the Act) an ordinary free period of insurance of, on average.  21 months(If,  during this period, a reasonable amount of insurable employment is obtained, another full free period is, as at present,  to be given on ceasing employment).      During the free period of 21 months insured persons are to be protected for pensions purposes and entitled to all health insurance benefits, i c e.  medical treatment, maternity benefit, additional benefits and sickness and.disablement benefits, in which there are no longer to be any reductions by reason of unemployment.Bo If at the commencement of the free period aninsured person has been continuously insured for not less than ten years his insurance is to be kept in, force from year to year so long as he proves that he is available for but is unable to obtain insurable employment.Daring such prolongation:-he is not to be entitled to(a) Sickness or Disablement Benefits(b) Maternity Benefit( c) Auc.itiona.1 Cash Benefits.but is to be entitled to(a) Medical treatment(b) Additional treatment benefits (c^ Pensions protection and     (d) Continued membership of his Approved Society.-4-.
If he resumes employment, full benefits are to be restored after 26 weeks of employment, and the payment of 26 contributions, within any period of 104 weeks.I f Jhe doe s no t re gu a j iffy py employment and fai Is to prove coxitinned unemploymentt his insurance is to be&quot;^ef,minated&quot;uliTe&quot;i3s&quot;he &quot;elects&quot; to continue as a Voluntary Cont r i b u t o r,The Committee agree that from the point of view of maintaining the distinction between a contributory and a non contributory scheme the ideal arrangement would have been a plan based strictly on surrender values.      This, however,  is impracticable as the Approved Societies do not possess the necessary information and data.      The scheme suggested by the Treasury (see Table in paragraph 10 of Memorandum ;B) has some approximation to a surrender value basis, but for the following, among other reasons, the Committee prefer the scheme of the Health Departments.This scheme does not involve any serious breach in the contributory principle;    as will be seen by reference to Column 3 of Table B to Memorandum A there will still be a balance in the Fund of over  2,000*000 in 1946,  which shows that the concessions contemplated will not have the effect of making the Fund insolvent0      The Treasury scheme would cast a very great administrative burden on the Approved Societies and from the political point of view it would be disastrous to do anything to antagonise those Societies at the present time.      The Treasury scheme contemplates reductions in the Widows&apos; Pensions,      Incidentally this also raises the question whether similar reductions would have to be made in the case of Old Age Contributory Pensions,      The 10/- Widows&apos; Pension is already criticised as inadequate, and the proposal to reduce it to 5/- in certain cases would be very widely advertised.      While it is true that this proposal only applies to a very limited class, the number of widows vfhose pension would be reduced under the scheme would be greatly exaggerated by its critics.
9 t* 6 0Even if the proposal to reduce the Widows&apos; pensions was abandoned,  the Approved  Societies   would not be relieved of the administrative burden, they would still have to keep individual records to determine the period of protection.irotection for persons withs then ten ears contin-ous Insurance.The Committee have considered the position of insured persons who have been continuously insured for less than ten years and who, under the scheme favoured by the Committee, will be deprived of rights to which they are now entitled.      These persons are very few in number and most of them will be young; persons with a good chance of re-entering again into insurance.      The cost of including in the scheme some provision for persons who have been continuously insured for not less than four years need not be great and would not complicate seriously the adminis-tration of the Approved Societies.      It is very desirable that the legislation to be introduced should be legislation to concede benefits and not to reduce them.The Committee&apos;s conclusions on Question (3) are as f ollows&apos;; -(1)  That the answer to Question (3)  should be that the persons due to go out of Pensions Insurance on 31st December,  1935,  should not lose pension rights on that date and that means must be found, for a reasonable protection of these rights during unemploy-rnent,(2) That in order to give effect to (1) above,the  scheme to cover both Health and Pensions Insurance submitted by the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland should be adopted subject to the vmodification in (3) below,(3)  That consideration should be given to the position of persons who have been continu-ously insured for not less than four years ,  and less than ten years with a view to making some provisions for such persons should it be necessary to do so.
9 hi  i(4) That it should &quot;be left for the Minister of Health,  in consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland,  to decide if any con-cession under (5) above is to be made, whether the concession should be inserted in the Bill as introduced,  or whether it should be made after the actual introduction of the Bill.Memorandum C.    Question (4).If the persons referred to in (3) are to be retained within the Contributory pensions Scheme should they also be kept within the scheme of Health Insurance to such an extent as  the finance of the latter scheme will permit?The Committee agree that the determining factor isthat stated in the last sentence of the first paragraphof Memorandum C, viz?&quot;If persons who are to be retained in insurance for pensions purposes were not to continue as members of their Approved. Societies it would be necessary for the Department to set up its own central machinery in order that the evidence of sickness and unemployment necessary for pensions purposes should be forthcoming&quot;,The Committee!s recommendation on Question (4)  isas   follows i-To adopt the suggestion that it will be sufficient that,  in the event of unemployment continuing beyond the end of the ordinary free period (21 months on the average) a title to medical benefit only should thereafter be given with easy conditions for re-entry into full bene3?its after the resumption of employment.Memorandum Dc    Question ( 5).Is it desirable  that persons who remain covered for sickness,  disablement and maternity benefits uncier the Health Insurance Scheme&apos; should be relieved from any reduction or suspension of .vthose benefits by reason of arrears of contributions owing to unemployment?As pointed out in the Memorandum no more popular changecould be introduced in the National   Health Insurance.Scheme than the total excusal of arrears due to unemploymentKIM ir   ti^fB : i M       -/:&apos;.&apos;-v Wy&amp;M W&amp;M i-5 : W^XM: i &apos;
9 OThe Commit tee&apos;s recommendations on Question (5) are as follows i -(.1) To adopt the scheme for the total excusal of arrears of contributions due to unemployment set out in Memorandum D,  under which half the cost of the  scheme would be met by a levy on contribution and the remaih-ing half (about  7 50,000 a year) by a grant from the Exchequer.(2) That the arrangement should be on a 50-50 basis,  so  that with improvement in the unemployment figures the burden, both on the Approved Societies and the Exchequer,  will automatically fall.(3) That the Minister of health and theSecretary of State for Scotland should negotiate with the Approved Societies on the lines proposed in Memorandum D as summarised above.Suggested Memorandum E.Increase of insurance The Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee areIncome Limit.about to examine the question of the increase of the income limit for non-manual workers in the case of Unemployment Insurance,  and the Committee recommend that no decision in regard to Health and Pensions Insurance should be reached until the Statutory Committee have reported on the unemployment insurance aspects of the matter.The Committee&apos;s attention - has been drawn to the very heavy burdens which the proposals would impose on the Exchequer (see paragraphs 8-10 of Memorandum E).      This consideration may well be the factor which will determine-v.the rejection of an increase of the income limit.The Committee recommend;That further consideration of the suggestions in Memorandum E should be  deferred pending the Report and Recommendations    of the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee.

Insurance and Contributory Pensions Bill.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE AND WIDOWS&apos;,   ORPHANS&apos; AND OLD AGE CONTRIBUTORY PENSIONS&apos;  SCHEME.SUMMARY OP POINTS FOR CONSIDERATIONIncrease of Pension Contributions.Section 43 of the Contributory Pensions Act, 1925, provides that, unless Parliament otherwise determines,  the weekly contribution for pensions is to be increased by 2d. for men and by Id. for women as from the 1st January, 1936. Duration of Insurance as affected by unemployment.(a)    Health Insurance.The main provisions of the National Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions Act,  1932,   effected that persons who had had 2-f- years of unemployment had their health insurance terminated.      135,090 persons dropped out at 31st December, 1933 solely by reason of prolonged unemployment and this number, after allowing for those who regain employment, will, it is estimated,   increase to approximately 200,000 by 31st December, 1935.(b )    Pensions.The health insurance arrangements of the 1932 Act as regards termination of insurance were adopted for pensions purposes with the substitution of 3-f years for 2-f years and with a special provision that no person should lose his pension rights before 31st December, 1935.      An undertaking was given
that the whole pensions position would be reviewed when the first statutory Report of the Government Actuary on the financial working of the pension scheme is received.    (That Report will be available in the Spring of this year).      If no change is made in existing legislation some 300,000 persons by reason of prolonged unemployment will lose all pension rights on 31st December, 1935.Effect of unemployment upon arrears under the Health Insurance scheme.The Rational Health Insurance Aot of 1928 provided that there should be no reduction of the insured person&apos;s cash benefit by reason of arrears of contributions due to unemployment.       This concession was modified by the 1932 Act which   provided that only one-half of such arrears should, be excused,  so that cash benefits again became reducible on account of arrears due to unemployment.The following questions,  therefore,  arise:-1.      Is the increase in contributions due to take effect on 1st January, 1936, to be allowed to operate?     (See Memo. A)2.      If this increase is to be brought into operation,  is it possible to make any set off by a concurrent decrease of the unemployment insurance contribution?3.      Are the persons,  estimated to number 200,000, who are due to go out of pensions insurance on 31st December, 1935, to be allowed to lose all pension rights on that date or should some means be found for a reasonable&apos; protection of these rights during unemployment?    (See Memo. B).4.      If the persons referred to in (3) are to be retained within the Contributory Pensions scheme,  should they also be kept within the scheme of Health Insurance to such an extent as the finance of the latter scheme will permit?      (See Memo. C
5.      Is it desirable that persons who remain covered for sickness, disablement and maternity benefits under the Health Insurance scheme should be relieved from any reduction or suspension of those benefits by reason of arrears of contributions owing to unemployment?  .   (See Memo. D) .A Memorandum (E) is also attached explaining the position with regard to the demand for an increase of the income limit for insurability in the case of non-manual workers.      It is expected that this question will be raised as soon as an announcement is made of impending legislation in connection with National Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions.This paper has been agreed between the Treasury, the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland.(Intld. )    E. H. Y.27th February, 1935.
Section 43(2) of the WidowsT, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act, 1925, provides:&quot;Unless Parliament otherwise determines, during the decennial period commencing the first day of January, 1936, the ordinary rates of contribution shall be increased in the case of men by twopence a week (of which in the case of employed persons one- penny shall be payable by the employer and one penny by the employed, person), and in the case of women by one penny a week (of which in the case of employed persons one halfpenny shall&apos; be payable by the employer and. one halfpenny by the employed person), and similar additional increases shall be made in the contributions at the beginning of the decennial periods commencing the first day of January, 194S and 1956&quot;.The contributions to the  social insurance schemed immediately before the commencement of the pension scheme, at the commencement of that scheme, and today, are shown in the following table: -Questions (l) and (2).(1)     Is the increase in contributions due to take effect on 1st January, 1936, to be allowed to operate?(2)      If this increase is to be brought into operation is it possible to make any set-off by a concurrent decrease of the unemployment insurance contribution?

In the interval, however,  the unemployment contribution has been increased by 5d., the health and pension contributions remaining unchanged. If the increase in the pension contribution,  due to take effect on 1st January,  1936,  becomes effective and there is no reduction in the contributions to the other schemes,  the position as from 1st January,  1936 will be that the total contribution to the social insurance schemes will be 3s.  4d-*.. (women 2s .8d.),  being 7d.   (women Sd.)  in excess of that in force when the pension scheme began.      It is estimated&apos;that the increase will produce  5,200,000 in the first full year of its operation (1936-37).      The estimate is based on a rate of unemployment equal to the average rate over the last give financial years.
The financial effect on the pension scheme according as the increase in contributions   is or is not imposed is shown in Columns (l) and (2) of the attached Tables A. and B.Table A. has been prepared on the basis that the average rate of unemployment in the decennium will be 14&apos;g&quot; per cent., which is the average rate over the last five financial years.    (The rate shown is the rate of unemployment in the section of the population insured under the Contributory Pensions Acts and corresponds to a rate of 13 per cent, in the (smaller)  section insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts).       Table B. is based on an average rate of unemployment of 13 per cent., approximately the rate prevailing in December 1934, when the table was prepared.Col. 1 of each table shows the balance in. the fund at the end of each year on the assumption that the Acts will operate unchanged and that therefore the increase in contributions will become effective.Col. 2 shows the balance on the assumption that the increase in contributions is not imposed, but that in all other respects the Acts will operate unchanged.Col. 1 of Table A. shows that with the increase in operation there will be a balance in the account at the end of the decennium amounting to  5,000,000.On the more favourable assumption as to the course of unemployment on which Table B. is based, that balance should be increased to  11,600,000.If on the other hand the increase is not imposed, Col. 2 of Table A.  shows that the account will be exhausted in the course of the financial year 1938-39 and an additional Exchequer contribution of  1,800,000 will be required to keep the scheme going to the end of that year.      The additional
Exchequer contributions required to meet the expenditure up to the end of the second decennium (i.e. to 31st March, 1946) amount to  50,100,000.On the more favourable assumption as to the course of unemployment adopted in Table B, the account without the increase in contributions will be exhausted in the course of the financial year 1939-40 and an additional Exchequer contribution of  5,400,000 will be required to keep the scheme going to the end of that year.      The additional Exchequer contributions required to meet the expenditure up to the end of the decennium amount to  45,000,000.The purpose of Ools. 3 and 4 of these Tables is shown in a note at the end of memorandum B.Table C. shows in detail the receipts into and payments out of the Pensions Account with the resulting balances for each year from 1st April, 1934 to 31st March, 1946 on the basis of existing legislation,  i.e. it assumes that the contribution increases will take effect on 1st January,  1936-- and that the provisions relating to lapse from insurance through prolonged unemployment will continue to operate throughout the period.      The rate of unemployment adopted is 14g- per cent,  the average over the last five financial years.      Column 11 of this Table reappears as Column 1 of Table A.

ka?vlOR.&amp;r:Duia ^ 3.QJiejstioiL .5 -Are the persons, estimated to number 200,000 who are due to go out of pensions insurance on 31st December, 1935, to be allowed to lose all pension rights on that date or should some means be found for a reasonable protection of these rights during unemployment?1.      Under a provision of the National Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions Act,  1932, a number of persons estimated at 200,000 will go out of insurance at 31st December 1935 by reason of prolonged unemployment and thereupon they will lose all rights under the Contributory Pensions Acts.      This will be the    first occasion on which unemployment has involved the termination of the pension insurance of persons whose insurance and contribution records at the date when their unemployment began reached a certain standard.2.      Prolongation of insurance on account of unemployment was first instituted in health insurance  in 1921 and applied to the contributory pensions scheme  on its inception in 192G.      It continued in operation for both health and pensions insurance until 1932.      As a result of the National Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions Act, 1932, 135,000&apos;&quot; persons ceased to be entitled to health insurance benefits    on 31st December, 1933, and further members fell into the same class at the end of each Subsequent half-year, but pensions rights were preserved until 31st December, 1935.      It is estimated that on that date -vapproximately 200,000 persons will cease to be insured for pensions purposes.3.      Under existing legislation the position as regards pensions after 31st December, 1935, will be that insurance will
not be terminated on account ox unemployment until 3-f- years (on average) have elapsed since the last -week of employment, provided the person concerned had been insured for four years and had paid 160 contributions.      That this is a generous provision cannot be doubted but its merits will be apt to be overlooked if on one day 200,000 persons lose all their pension rights because of prolonged unemployment more especially when this exodus will synchronise with the raising of the pensions contributions.      It is v/wellworthy of note that of the 135,000 who lost their health insurance rights in December 1933 52 per cent of the men and 45 per cent of the women had been ininsurance since 1912 and 43 per cent of the men and 27 per cent of the women were over 50 years of age.4.      It will be generally admitted that one special feature of the pension scheme which merits serious consideration is that, though contributions must be paid during employment, there will be no return for these contributions (apart from cover for widows&apos; pensions) if by reasons of unemployment contributions are not paid over a specified period.5.      It should also be borne in mind in considering a remedy that the problem is not in the main one of persons who fall into permanent unemployment.     Of the persons included in the class of persons enjoying prolongation in January 1934 6 7 per cent of the men and 71 per cent of the women had paid some contributions as recently as 1930 which shows that they had&apos; not entered the olass   before January 1933,      The majority of young entrants to the class will regain employment and again become contributors to the scheme.      There is obviously a greater case for consideration of the man -who happens to die while out of employment if his career would normally be one of alternations between being in employment and out of employment than in the case of a man who is permanently unemployed.
6.      Various alternatives can be suggested for dealing with &quot;this position ranging from (a) prolongation throughout unemployment after the completion of a qualifying   test based on a substantial period of continuous insurance to  (b) a scheme &quot;based on surrender values under &quot;which the period of protection and the rate of pension will vary according to the duration in insurance.7.      In the interests of simplicity and economy of administration coupled with the fact that the persons concerned form only about 1 per cent of the insured population, and with the object of achieving a final settlement, the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland put forward for consideration the scheme set out in the appendix to this memorandum.     Under that scheme an unemployed man, provided he had been continuously insured for at least ten years when his unemployment began, would have his pension rights preserved so long as he proved that he was genuinely unemployed.      Ten years continuous insurance is taken as an adequate test and it is recalled that this period was adopted in the original Act as the qualifying condition for special privileges for three separate classes of elderly contributors.      (A scheme based on past contributions is not practicable as the Approved Societies, the sole custodians of the insurance records, do not keep life records of their members&apos;  contributions).This scheme with its qualifying test of 10 years&apos; insurance may appear to be unduly generous in that it would dover young men of (say) 26 to 50 but the risk of prolonged unemploy-ment is relatively slight at the younger ages and it must not be forgotten that the grant of prolongation does not involve any cost to the pensions fund unless and until a pension becomes payable as a result of the grant of prolongation.     The risk to the pensions fund is slight during the early years of a man&apos;s i ns u r ance life.
8.     The pension scheme has operated on the basis of prolongation throughout unemployment since its inception.      Under a properly enforced scheme of compulsory contributions during employment, continuity of insurance during a period of proved involuntary unemployment, however long, is theoretically a proper insurance risk since the appropriate loading could be made in theory for any quantity of unemployment (whether of short duration or long).      To what extent prolongation can and should be adopted as a permanent feature of the scheme is, therefore, to a considerable extent, a question of coot.      Table B appended to Memorandum A shews that on the basis of prolongation throughout unemployment there should be a surplus in the Pensions Fund at the end of the next decennium (1946) of  2,300,000 exclusive of the profit on realisation of investments which at present amounts to  2-g- millions.      The fact that the Exchequer contribution to the pension scheme is in the form of a grant sufficient to keep the. scheme solvent is, of course, no justification for adopting a principle which could not be justified in the case of a scheme where the Exchequer contribution was related to the other, contributions.      On the other hand, the Exchequer has, by the Act, undertaken to provide specified annual amounts, and, if despite the estimated surplus, the scheme is to be more restricted than in the past the Exchequer may be open to the charge that it is reducing its liability at the expense of the contributors.9.      The Treasury considers that the right method of meeting the three types of cases proposed, namely, the high average age of the class, the absence of benefit where contributions have been paid and the fact that lapsing is not in many cases a permanent experience of the insured person, is by the grant of modified pensions on the broad analogy of paid up insurance policies and of a period of protection roughly proportionate to the period during which the insured person has been in insurance coupled with a provision which enables permanent protection for full pension to be given on generous lines for men who have had substantial
periods in insurance and consequently have reached a reasonable age.10.    It is submitted by the Treasury for consideration that a practical scheme would be on the following lines.^iod of insurance up to me of becoming unemployed.t more than 10 yearsre than 10 years but not more than12 years12 14 16 182014 16 1820Period of protection.[Widows1 pension if death occurs during period of protectionI4- years       &quot;6 &quot; 7 &quot; 8 &quot; 9 &quot; unlimited(a ) up to 21 months(b ) beyond 121 months10/-10/-	5/-10/-	6/-10/-	7/-10/-	8/-10/-	9/-10/-	10/-11.      It may be argued against this scheme that the pension of 10/- is regarded in some quarters already as inadequate and that, therefore, there would be political difficulty in carrying modified pensions below 10/-.      It may also be argued that Approved Societies will be involved in administration in connec-tion with the scheme to which they may object.     As regards these arguments the Treasury point out that the pension is not and has never purported to be maintenance for the widow and that the grant of 10/- pension in all cases would make the difference of treat-ment between men just inside and just outside whatever scheme is adopted more striking.      It would also if granted in respect of exiguous contribution records make more difficult the refusal of pension to those classes who are not at present allowed to contribute.      As regards the latter point it should be remembered that Approved Societies are already involved in administration of the ordinary concession of 21 months retention and that under the Act of 1932 this is supplemented by a further period of retention of one year.      The position of Approved Societies is, however, a reason for keeping the scheme on the broadest possible lines consistent with the maintenance of the principles which underlie it.
12.      As regards the 1&apos;reasury scheme, the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health-for Scotland agree that if modified pensions on a surrender value basis are to be adopted,  a duration table on the lines proposed is essential but in their view the basis adopted, will almost necessarily involve the extension of the table to make some proportionate provision for persons more than 4 years but not more than 6 years in insurance1! II        g It II II I! IT        g TI II IITI TI        3 TI II II II II &quot; &quot; &quot;Difference of treatment of persons one side or the other of a dividing line,  of course, will arise,  in greater or lesser degree, with any scheme which does not give complete protection. As, however, under- the permanent provisions of the Act of 1932, persons who have been four years in insurance and have paid 160 contributions are to be covered for full pensions for 31r years the table will concentrate attention on the fact - a feature of both schemes - that the rights of persons who have only a, short period of insurance are being curtailed in order to benefit those who have a comparatively long insurance record and are therefore in general more - advanced in age.13.      The Treasury scheme,  even without the provision of modified pensions,  is complicated by reason of the variable periods of prolongation determined according to duration in insurance and it is for serious consideration whether the circumstances justify its imposition upon the 7 ,000 Approved Societies and Branches.      Such a scheme in operation would go some way to neutralise the administrative simplification which will be achieved by the Arrears Scheme (Memo. D)  but it is partly on the strength of the simplification and reduction of work that the departments - case depends for asking-Societies to consent to a levy of  750,000 a year.      In the
opinion of the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland such saving in the  cost of pensions as might result from the adoption of the Treasury scheme would almost certainly be lost to the Pensions Account, as Societies would put up a strong case to he remunerated for purely pensions work.     The risk of error in the  certificates which Societies furnish in connection with pension claims would be  increased and with it the embarrassment to the Department in having to  cancel pensions in payment on receipt of notification from the Treasury Auditor, perhaps a year after the  award, that the Society certificate had been incorrect14.      The Treasury scheme  involves that  at the  end of each half-year from 1937 onwards a number of persons - a small number it is true  - will be due to go out  of pensions insurance and will also lose their right to medical benefit, for it is agreed that insurance for health and for pension purposes must be conterminous.The financial effect of the retention of these 200,000 persons in full pensions insurance is shown in cols. 3 and 4 of Tables A and B appended to Memo. A.From col. 3 of Table A it  appears that if the increase in contributions takes effect the   account will be able to carry, without further Exchequer assistance, until1about the  end of 1945 the  persons who would be due  to go out1of insurance because  of unemployment.      Assistance from the Exchequer would only be.required in 1945-46, the  last year of the decennium, when an additional  2,000,000 would securelifsolvency.      The effect  over the clecermlurn of the retention of these persons in the   scheme would be to convert a balanceI If
,of  7,500,000 ( 5,000,000 in last line of ool.l of Table A plus  2,500,000**) into a deficit of  2,000,000.On the more favourable unemployment experience assumed in Table B the account (as shown by col.3 of the Table) would be able to carry these persons throughout the decennium and there would be a balance in the fund at the end of the decennium of  2,200,000.     The effect of their retention, on this assumption as to the course of unemployment, would be to reduce a balance of  11,600,000 (last line of ool.l of Table B) to  2,200,000.Col.4 of Table A when compared with col.2 of the same table shows that, if the increase of contributions is not imposed, the retention of these persons in insurance will have only a slight effect on the date of the exhaustion of the account.     The account would be exhausted in the course of the same year (1958-39) but the additional Exchequer contribution required to keep the scheme going to the end of the year would be increased from  1,800,000 to  2,700,000.A comparison of cols. 4 and 2 of Table B shows that, on the more favourable unemployment experience assumed in the Table, the retention of these persons would again not appreciably accelerate the date of exhaustion of the account.^The investments held at 31st Mavch, 1934, show a market value  2,500,000 in excess of the book values.     This profit will accrue year by year as the Investments are realised but the form of the Tables does not perm.it of the annual accretions being shown year by year.     An amount of  2.,500,000 has therefore been taken into account in col.3 for the year 1944-45 when the last of the investments held will have to oe realised.     This amount has not appeared in col.1 and therefore when the position at the end of the decennium as shown by Gols . 1 and 3 is compared it is necessary to add  2,500,000 to the  5,000,000 shown in col.l.
APPENDIX TO MEMORANDUM B .DRAFT OP NEW SCHEME TO COVER BOTH HEALTH AND PENSIONS INSURANCE.tSubmitted by the MINISTRY OF HEALTH and the DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH FOR SCOTLAND)-On ceasing to. he insurably employed all insured persons to have (as at present under Section 3(1) of the Act) an ordinary free period of insurance of, on average, 21 months.(If, during this period, a reasonable amount. .of insurable employment is obtained, another full free period is, as at present, to be given on ceasing employment).    During the free period of 21 months insured persons are to be protected for pensions purposes and entitled to all health insurance benefits, i.e., medical treatment, maternity benefit, additional benefits and sickness and disablement benefits,  in which there are no longer to be any reductions by reason of unemployment.li at the commencement of the free period an insured person had peen continuously insured for not less than ten years his insurance is to be kept in force from year to year so long as he proves that he is available for but is unable to obtain insurable employment.During such prolongation:-he is not to be entitled to(a) Siciniess or Disablement Benefits(b) Mat e r n i .y Benefit(c) Additional Cash Benefits. but is to be entitled to(a) medical treatment(b) Additional treatment benefits(c) Pensions protection and (d)    Continued membership of his Approved Society.
If he resumes employment, full benefits are to be restored after 26 weeks of employment, and the payment of 2b contributions, within any period of 104 weeks.If he does not requalify by employment and fails to prove continued unemployment,  his insurance is to be terminated unless he elects to continue as a Voluntary Contributor.
MEM Oil AMDUM G.Question (4)      If the persons referred to in (3) are to be retained within the Contributory Pensions Scheme should they also be kept within the scheme of Health Insurance to such an extent as the finance of the letter scheme will permit?The Contributory Pensions Scheme is closely interlocked with the scheme of National Health Insurance.     Every person insured under the Health Insurance Scheme is required to be insured for pensions, and &quot;insured&apos;&apos; for the purposes of the Pensions Scheme is defined in Section 2 of the Contributory Pensions Act, 1925, as meaning &quot;insured under the national Health Insurance Acts&apos;&apos;. The contributions under the two schemes are paid by means of a single joint stamp and the evidence  as to duration of insurance, number of contributions, periods of sickness and unemployment, which. Is required to substantiate a claim, to pension is obtained through the records kept by Approved Societies for &quot;National Health Insurance purposes.     It is, therefore, most desirable, and indeed past experience has shown it to be essential, that insurance under the two schemes should be conterminous -     If persons who are to be retained in insurance for pensions purposes were not to continue as members of their Approved Societies it would be necessary for the Department to set up its own central machinery in order that the evidence  of sickness and unemployment necessary for pensions purposes should be forthcoming.The retention of unemployed persons in Health Insurance does not necessarily mean that they must remain entitled to all Health Insurance benefits, but unless they are given a title to some benefit insurance would be meaningless.It is suggested that It would be sufficient that, in the event of unemployment continuing beyond the end of the ordinary free period (21 months on the average)  a title to medical benefit only should thereafter be given with easy conditions for r^e-entry into full benefits after the resumption of employment.
The recent lapse of 135,000 persons from medical benefit has given rise to continuous agitation amongst Approved Societies, Insurance Committees and the medical profession and there can be no doubt that the restoration of title to this benefit would be very popular.     If the proposal outlined in Memorandum D could be adopted, the money required to cover the cost of continuance of medical benefit during unemployment (not a large sum) would be available.     On the other hand the cost of retaining title to slcknes.3 and disablement benefits during unemployment, however prolonged, would be altogether beyond the resources of Approved Societies.     It is believed that if arrears due to unemployment were remitted as proposed in Memorandum D with the result that there would be no reduction in sickness or disablement benefit during the ordinary free period of 21 months the continuance thereafter of medical benefit only would be accepted as generally satisfactory and the schemes of Health and Pensions insurance would be made conterminous.
Memor andum...D.jfoiestion^ (5).Is it desirable that persons who remain covered for siokness, disablement and maternity benefits under the Health Insurance Scheme should be relieved from any reduotion or suspension of those benefits by reason of arrears of contributions owing to unemployment?..   No more popular change could be introduced in the scheme of National Health Insurance than the total excusal of&quot; arrears due to unemployment;     This concession was in . fartt &quot;made in the Act of 1928 but had to be abandoned in 1932 by reason, of: the increase in the volume of unemployment to such an extent as to make it impossible for Approved Societies to stand the burden. Since 1932 arrears due to unemployment have only been excused normally to the extent of one half though particular Approved Societies which could afford to do so have increased the proportion to be excused.In consequence of the partial exousal only of arrears societies have now to send out to their members over five million arrears notices every year, and of the members who receive these notices only about one quarter redeem their arrears.   The result of this is that nearly four million insured persons are left subjeot to a reduction in the rates of their cash benefits (sickness, disablement and maternity) by reason of the fact that they have been unemployed, and over half a million of these are not entitled to any sickness or disablement benefit at all.The total excusal of arrears would save societies a vast amount of work, would be a great boon to millions of insured persons who have been unemployed, and would provide a great simplification of the insurance scheme.
The concession would, however,  throw a heavy-strain on the finances of the schema.     Societies already bear a burden of about  700,000 a year by reason of the partial excusal of arrears and the total excusal would increase this to  8,100,000 a year.     It would be impossible to impose the whole of this additional burden on the funds of Approved Societies.      The position could be cased to a large extent through a partial equalisation of the burden by moans of a small levy on every contribution paid, the proceeds being put into a special unemployment arrears fund and divided amongst societies in proportion to the volume of unemployment amongst their members.     A proposal on these lines which would afford a partial solution of the problem has in fact been put forward voluntarily by the largest group of societies and has received a considerable measure of support.The maximum levy which could bo put on contributions for this purpose without endangering the solvency of the whole scheme is l/3rd of a Id, for men.     The levy for women would be l/9th of a Id.     This would, however, only provide about one half of the money required at the present rate of unemployment. The additional half left unprovided would at present amount to nearly  750,000 a year, and it is submitted that consideration should be given to the possibility of providing this sum from the Exchequer.If this can be done it is suggested that the arrangement should be placed on a 50-50 basis so that with improvement in the unemployment figures- the burdGn both on societies and the Exchequer would automatically fall.-Bp guarantee can bo given that the societies would consent to a levy of the magnitude proposed, but the gesture from the Government, coupled with the great saving of administrative work in connection with arrears, and the fact
that the stjheme would seoure th.6 continuance of medical treatment, and, therefore, of society membership as long as insurance was maintained for pensions purposes, would be powerful factors in creating eri atmosphere favourable for the negotiations.
MliMORAMDUM E. . ^Suggested Increase of Insuranc^e Income Limit. [The attention of the Committee is directed to this subject because an announcement of impending legislation in connection with National Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions is almost certain to revive the agitation for an enlargement of the scope of the social insurance  schemes to include the &quot;black-coated&quot; workers. ]1.      For some years there has been a series of representations that the national insurance schemes, unemployment, health and pensions,  should be extended to include non-manual workers employed at a rate of remuneration exceeding  250 per annum.      The Rational Federation of Professional Workers (claiming to represent &quot;black-coated&quot; workers)  in particular persist in pressing for the extension.      In paragraph 341 of their Final Report the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance said that they considered on general grounds that it would be desirable&apos; to raise the income limit to  350 for Unemployment Insurance.      They did not recommend any change in the present figure because they recognised the difficulties which the extension would cause in Health and Pensions Insurance and the desirability that the limit should be the same for the two schemes.      The task of resisting proposals for the extension of the schemes falls to the Ministry of Health,  since the Ministry of Labour is not in a position to say that the Unemployment Scheme would be seriously prejudiced by the proposed extension.      It may be noted, however,  that this extension of Unemployment Insurance would involve the. Exchequer in a contribution of over  600,000 a year.2. &quot; At present the compulsory provisions of Health and. Pensions Insurance do not apply to persons employed at a rate of remuneration exceeding  250 per annum, unless they are employed by way of manual labour.      This income limit was  160 per annum in the original Insurance Act of 1911 and was
raised to  250 per annum in 1919.     On the Ministry of labour index of the cost of living the original  160 would today be equivalent to  230 approximately so that the existing income limit of  250 may be said to effect some slight extension of the original scope of insurance.3.    The demand for an increase of the income limit could not therefore be put forward on the ground that it was required in order to restore the original scope of the scheme which changes in the value of money had curtailed.     It is in fact urged that in the conditions now prevailing the original scope is too restricted and ought to be enlarged.     The main arguments advanced before the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance in favour of the proposal are based on the increased risk of unemployment to which non-manual workers earning more than  250 a year are now subject, and the greater difficulty of obtaining re-employment in the case of non-manual as compared with manual workers.     On a first view these, arguments would seem to be mainly relevant to the question of Unemployment Insurance but they are of widar application.     Insecurity of employment certainly does not reduce the need to make provision for sickness, for old age, and for dependants but, if employment is intermittent, the possibility of making such provision is diminished by the reduction of the total income and it is on that ground that the claim for an enlargement of the scope of the Health and Pensions Schemes is based.4.     This &quot;new insecurity&quot; is ascribed to two causes (a) trade depression generally and (b) rationalisation, resulting in amalgamation of firms and consequent economy of staffs, leading to dismissals.     Trade depression may pass and may recur but amalgamation of businesses, when completed, will be non-recurrant.     In the process of adjustment numbers of employees will unfortunately suffer but when the process is complete a condition of stability should ensue.     It is open
to question whether a permanent change in the scope of the Insurance Schemes would be an appropriate remedy for what is by its nature largely a temporary evil.5.     A further argument advanced before the Royal Commission was that the present limit of  250 a year stands at a peculiarly critical and troublesome point in that in many cases non-manual workers found themselves sometimes above and sometimes below, the limit.      In so far as it is a fact that the remuneration of a large body of non-manual workers oscillates about  250 a year,  sometimes rising above and sometimes falling below that, figure,  it suggests that remuneration in the neighbourhood of  250 a year marks a definite dividing line in the class of non-manual workers:    for a large proportion of the class it will represent not merely a stage in the process of advancement but the ultimate goal, while for those who are fortunate to pass beyond it there is a reasonable prospect that they will advance much further.      This argument then, while it might be used to support a slight increase in the remuneration limit,  seems to give no help to those who claim that the limit should be raised to  350 or  500.6.    It is to be noted that a person who by reason of changes in the rate of his remuneration - is sometimes within and sometimes without the compulsorily insurable class can keep his Health and Pensions Insurance continuous by voluntary insurance during the periods when he is not compelled to be insured.      Further the great majority of non-manual workers earning more than  250 a year have at some time in the past been in the compulsorily insurablo class long enough to be Qualified for voluntary insurance,  the qualification being employment and insurance as employed contributors for at least 104 weeks.      Some have indeed availed themselves of this opportunity of maintaining their insurance but the majority have not, and this fact suggests the question how far the
P.&quot; orepresentations made for this extension of the soope of compulsory insurance represent a genuine demand from the rank and file of the class affected.      No doubt those who have become voluntary contributors would be glad if their employers were obliged to pay half of the contribution which they now have to find themselves, but if the advantages of insurance have so little attraction for the majority of the class that they are unwilling to continue it on a voluntary basis, one is inclined to doubt whether they would welcome a change in the law designed to compel them to contribute to the Insurance Schemes.    In this connection- it is worthy of note that a number of the Associations represented on the national Federation of Professional Workers include classes (e.g. civil servants, local government officers, railway clerks) which would be largely excepted from the social Insurance Schemes, whatever income limit might be adopted.7.    But however real the demand may be, the financial implications of the proposal must obviously be scrutinised before a conclusion is reached as to its feasibility.     An estimate which has been made by the Government Actuary shows clearly that the adoption of the proposal would impose very heavy burdens on the Exchequer and on industry.      The calculations are based on an increase of the income limit to  350.,  the figure suggested in the Report of the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance. On that basis it is estimated that approximately 250,000 persons would be added to the insured population.      The adoption of a limit of  500, which is advocated by the National Federation of    v. Professional Yiforkers, would of course materially increase that figure and the resulting figures of cost which follow.8.      To take Health Insurance first, the mere addition of 250,000 insured persons, apart from any effect of age, would increase the present annual cost to the Exchequer by about  65,000.      But it is to be noted that the finances of the schemes,
&quot;both Health and Pensions, are based on the position that the general age of entry into insurance will be 16.      In the very nature of the ease this new group of entrants will be of middle age and -upwards and that fact would create an additional liability., the capital value of which would be about  1,500,000.    There is no means of meeting this additional liability within the present finances of the Health Insurance Scheme and,  short of an all-round increase in contributions, which the circumstances could hardly be held to justify, the only remedy would be a special Exchequer subvention of about  100,000 a year for 20 years.9.     A further point in connection with Health Insurance, though not immediately relevant to the question of the cost of the proposal,  should not be overlooked, viz.,  that there is every prospect of strong opposition from the medical profession to a proposal which would involve the grant of medical benefit on the ordinary insurance basis to a body of persons with incomes in -excess of  250 a year.10.    Por Pensions the figures of cost are much more serious. It is estimated that the capital cost of an extension of the income limit to  350 would amount to  30,000,000.      The Exchequer grant on existing legislation will be  14,000,000 in 1935-36 and is due to rise by  1,000,000 a year to  21,000,000 in 1942-43.      The extension would involve an addition to the Exchequer grant of  1,000,000 a year at the outset which would rise to about  2,000,000 in twenty years.      It would also increase the number of persons entitled to non-contributory pensions at the age of 70 through the waiving of the means test in the case of persons in.        .P :.-Vreceipt of contributory pensions when they attained that age.    The cost of pensions under the 1908 to 1924 Acts would therefore be gradually increased, the increase probably amounting to  1,000,000 a year in twenty-five years.11.     As regards the additional charge -which would fall directly on employers, it is estimated that the employers&apos; contributions to unemployment, health, and pensions insurance
&quot;would amount to about  1,200,000 a year.     Here it is to be noted that an additional 100,000 persons are concerned consisting of those in the class who are at present voluntary contributors under the Health and Pensions Scheme but would, on becoming compulsorily insured, be relieved of the cost of one half of their insurance at the expense of their employers.18.    This proposed extension of th6 scope of Health and Pensions insurance is not the only extension which is being pressed upon the Department.     There is the demand for the inolusion of persons who do not work for an employer, of whom large numbers are economically in no better position than that of the average insured person.     If need were the sole criterion, it is clear that those in this olass whose total incomes do not exceed the present insurable limit have a much stronger claim to consideration than non-manual workers whose remuneration is in excess of the limit.     This olass raises an exceedingly difficult problem.     They also have a high average age and the financial considerations discussed above would again arise.   But a much greater bar to their inclusion lies in the fact that, in the absence of an employer, no practioal way of making insurance compulsory has yet been found.     If on the other hand voluntary insurance were offered it is to be expected that those who took advantage of the offer would to a largo extent be relatively old persons, persons in poor health, married men with large families and/or young wives, who would draw from the fund amounts far in excess of their contributions to it.     The result would be a charge on the Exchequer which cannot be estimated but would undoubtedly be very heavy.13.    For the reasons given above it is submitted that an enlargement of the scope of the Insurance Schemes to include non-manual workers remunerated at over  250 a year cannot be contemplated and that the Cabinet should bo invited to decide accordingly.
