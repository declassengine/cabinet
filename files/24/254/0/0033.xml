Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP, 77 (35).CABINET.UNIFICATION OF COAL MINING ROYALTIES.memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I ATTACH, for the consideration of my colleagues, the report of the Committee which, under the Chairmanship of the Secretary for Mines, has been considering the future organisation of the coal mining industry.It will be remembered that as a result of their interim report, which I circulated on the 5th May, 1934 (CP. 129 (34)), the Committee were instructed to prepare a scheme for the unification of coal mining royalties under national ownership.  This they have done, the main points of their scheme being (1) That the transfer of ownership should be simultaneous, all coal mining royalties vesting in the acquiring authority on an appointed day;(2) That the acquiring authority should be the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission;(3) That the total amount of compensation to be paid for the royalties as a whole should be fixed by statute; the Committee are of opinion that it should be possible to agree this total amount with representatives of the royalty owners;(4) That the proportions in which this total sum should be distributed to individual royalty owners should be assessed by a specially appointed tribunal, with a panel of assessors.While the financial details of the administration of the royalties after acquisition cannot be estimated with accuracy until the total sum to be paid as compensation has been decided, the Committee are satisfied that, provided that the necessary loan can be raised at a rate of interest reasonably near to that prevailing for Government stock at the present time, the scheme should be self-supporting after providing for the payment of interest, Income Tax, Mineral rights Duty, &amp;o, and for a reasonable reserve for contingencies.I hope that my colleagues will authorise me to give instructions for the preparation of a Bill to give effect to the Committee &apos;s recommendations, and for the necessary approach to be made to the representatives of the royalty owners. We shall also have to take into account the most appropriate time for taking public action.Apart from the major question, decisions are needed on two points raised by the Committee : (1) As to whether the draftsman should be instructed to try to find some means of reconciling the independence of the Commission in day-to-day administration with the preservation of ministerial responsibility in matters of high policy (Section 1 (1) of the Report).(2) As to whether an additional payment is to be made by the Commission to the Exchequer (of the order of  250,000 per annum) over and above ordinary taxation, to compensate for loss of Surtax.W. R.Board of Trade, April 5, 1935.
INTER-DEPARTMENTAL   COMMITTEE   ON   THE   ORGANISATIONOF THE COAL INDUSTRY.Chairman-Mr. Ernest Brown, M.C., M.P.. Members &apos;Sir Alfred Faulkner, C.B., C.B.E.Sir Francis L. C. Floud, K.C.B.*Sir Ernest A. Gowers, K.C.B., K.B.E.Sir Frederick Phillips, K.C.M.G., C.B.Sir Horace J. Wilson, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., C.B.E.Secretaries Mr. G. Myrddin Evans (Ministry of Labour). Mr. G. H. D. Pryor (Mines Department).Report.IN our Interim Report of the 23rd April, 1934, we recommended in principle the unification of coal royalties and their administration by the Coal Mines1 Reorganisation Commission.&apos; &apos; We were then instructed to work out proposals in detail, with a representative of the Treasury added to our number. Sir Frederick Phillips joined the Committee, and we have also had the benefit of the advice of Sir Harriss Firth, Chief Valuer to the Board of Inland Revenue.The following is the scheme which we now submit. &apos; For subsequent convenience we have cast it into the form of the heads of a Bill.I.-Administrative Authority.1. The administrative authority should be the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission.Whatever body administers royalties should presumably have a status similar to the Central Electricity Board. If it is to be the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission as we think it should some alterations will have to be made in the status of that body, e.g., it will have to be self-supporting, appoint its own staff, have a common seal and power to own land, &amp;c.It is clearry desirable that the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission, in administering the royalties when acquired, should be in a position to do so without being subject to political pressure on behalf of local or sectional interests. At the same time, the performance of their duties may occasionally involve the decision of general questions of high importance politically (in their bearing, for instance, on the industrial well-being of large areas in cOaL mining districts) which Parliament will not allow to be removed from the sphere of ministerial responsibility. It may be doubted whether, after recent experiences; the House of Commons will be satisfied with an assurance that the Commission will naturally consult the Secretary for Mines on such questions and act only with his approval : there is likely to be a demand that the Act shall require them to do so. We think that the Cabinet must decide whether the draftsman should be instructed to try to find some means of reconciling the independence of the Commission in day-to-day administration with the preservation of ministerial responsibility in matters of high policy.2. The general duty of the Commission should be, in addition to any duty imposed on them by any other A ct, to manage and administer the property in coal and coal mining rights (but not themselves to undertake the business of coal mining), and to conduct their operations in such a way as to ensure that their revenues shall be sufficient to meet the charges imposed upon them.These points are elaborated later.* Until leaving for Canada in January 1935.
It. Transfer of Coal and Coal Mining Rights.1. All estates and interests in all coal and associated minerals (and under-ground coal mining rights) should vest in the Commission on the date when the Act receives the Royal Assent.(The expression &quot;underground coal mining rights&quot; includes, of course, underground wayleaves.) ...   - .In our Interim Report we left open the choice between a single operation acquiring all coal simultaneously and a series of operations acquiring it gradually. We have come to the conclusion that the former method is to be preferred, because, although most of the practical mining advantages of the unification of royalties could be secured by a gradual scheme without the initial period of difficulty for individual colliery owners (possibly lasting a year or two) involved in the simultaneous transfer to the State of thousands of leases, the latter system has the following advantages : (a) It avoids the prolonged uncertainty that would be caused by a seriesof operations at irregular intervals over a period of years. (6) The advantages of single ownership will be realisable immediately.(c) It enables advantage to be taken of a period of cheap money.(d) It simplifies the problem of valuation and affords a ready means of acquiring, once and for all, and without compensation, coal that has no present value.(e) Simultaneous  acquisition  is   a  more  impressive  measure,   with  a correspondingly greater political value.2. In the case of coal in lease the lessors&apos; rights and obligations under the lease will vest in the Commission, and an owner working his own coal will be entitled to a lease from the Commission subject to arbitration on terms if necessary.III. Compensation.1. Compensation should be payable in cash to any person who, after-notifying within six months his intention to claim compensation, makes a claim within a year of the passing of the Act, and proves that he had on that day an interest of value in the property acquired.We deal later with the question, how the cash is to be found.2. The total sum payable in compensation should be a sum specified in the Act.This proposal to fix beforehand the total liability is a vital part of our scheme. We need not emphasise the danger of leaving the total price to be arrived at by a process of valuing each property separately and aggregating the results. One of the most important factors in the valuation of a mineral property is the estimated rate of future working. If valuations were made separately of a number of separate properties, a future rate of working would be assumed for each, which, whilst it might be realised by any of them, could hot be realised by all. A total valuation so built up would be substantially in excess of the real value of the total asset acquired.The true value of the property to be acquired is its value as a single whole. The way in which we propose it should be arrived at is by calculating the present value of an annuity equal to the probable future royalty revenue, the rate of interest for capitalising such revenue having regard to the peculiar risks attaching to it. This calculation involves two figures that do not admit of precise determination, namely, (i) the probable future revenue from royalties, and (ii) the interest basis on which the present value of an annuity of that amount subject to those risks should be calculated. The first must be estimated by reference partly to the known figures of past years and partly to factors, likely to affect them in either direction in future. As to the second, it is a well-established practice of the valuation profession, long adopted by the Board of Inland Revenue for death duties, to estimate the freehold value of coal royalties by reference to the 8 per cent, interest tables i.e., by 12-1 years&apos; purchase.   But there is clearly room for bargaining under both heads, and we
suggest that an attempt should be made to agree a figure beforehand with the representative body of the royalty owners.I 3. An Assessing Tribunal should be set up, with a panel of assessors covering such geographical areas as may be prescribed by the Board of Trade, the members of the Tribunal being appointed by the Lord Chancellor.4. The assessors will consider claims and estimate the value of each claimant&apos;s property as a separate entity.5. The sum payable to any claimant as compensation will be a sum which bears to the figure arrived at under paragraph 4i in his case the same ratio as the sum specified in the A ct bears to the total of all the figures arrived at under paragraph 4.Since this is a most important part of our scheme and one to which criticism may be directed, we venture, at the risk of repetition, to add certain further observations.Broadly speaking, it is impossible for an owner of mineral royalties to dispose of his property on the market on more favourable terms than the 8 per cent, tables applied to the income which the purchaser thinks he is going to get from them. In the present case the parties are the whole body of royalty owners on the one side and the Acquiring Authority on the other; the proposal is that the usual practice should be followed and the property should be acquired at a price to be calculated by capitalising in the usual way the income which the purchaser thinks he is going to get from it. (We are assuming that a figure can be arrived at by agreement; we need not consider at present the complications that would be caused by a failure to agree.)That proposition seems to us quite unassailable. The danger of misunder-standing arises not as regards the quantum of the amount to be paid, but as regards its distribution to individuals.We can see no other method for determining this than the one we propose. It is impossible, of course, to contemplate paying the purchase price to some central authority on behalf of the royalty owners and leaving them to distribute it as they please. Equally, it seems to us, is it impossible to require the Tribunal to arrive at the amount of compensation due in each case by any direct process, avoiding that intermediate assessment which contains the possibilities of mis^ understanding. Far more coal is available than can be worked within any reason-able period, and in order to determine A&apos;s claim the Tribunal must decide how far future requirements for coal are to be met from A&apos;s property and how far from B&apos;s and C&apos;s. If it attempts to do this before hearing E and C, and has only a fixed sum to distribute between the three, it will certainly find either that it has given A too much, or that, in its anxiety not to fall into this trap, it has given him too little. It will be forced inevitably to fall back on making no final award until all have been heard, merely making a note in the meantime of their relative positions; and that is what we propose.We submit, therefore, that this method, which seems to us the only practicable method of securing the unification of mineral royalty rights on terms fair to the purchaser, is also the only method that is just to all the vendors. We are suggesting that royalty owners as a whole should be paid the full value of their property. And we are suggesting that the share of each of them in the total compensation should be left to be determined by judicial authority. The judicial tribunal would be free to adopt any uniform method of valuation which may seem reasonable and just as between different claimants. The total of its provisional individual assessments is, then, a figure of no significance in itself, the purpose of its operations being limited to the fair decision of the relative merits one to another of the claims made on behalf of individual owners.6. The sums thus arrived at will be payable to the claimants with interest from the appointed day.7. Pending completion of the valuations, present lessors should continue to administer their estates as heretofore, retaining the income from their royalties as payment on account of compensation, and accounting for it idtimately to the Commission, and making no alterations in leases, except with the approval of the Commission.8. At any time during the valuation the Commission, with the approval of the Treasury, should have power to pay claimants advances on account of
compensation, which must be accepted by the claimant if the amount offered is  20,000 or more. : - - &apos; &apos;It is obvious that no final awards could be made by the Tribunal until the assessors had completed all their valuations and the total of them could be related to the total sum available for distribution. This might take three years, but it should be - possible to make substantial payment &quot;on account&apos;&apos; to the, larger owners, and in this way a fair proportion of the total purchase price could be paid out within a year or so.9. The expenses of the Tribunal and assessors should be borne by the Commission and included in the total sum to be stated in the Act. Provision should be made in the Act for the payment of costs to claimants on a fixed scale, subject to the right of the Tribunal or assessors to reduce or withhold such costs in the case of frivolous claims.IV. Financial.1. A Royalties Fund should be created for the income and expenditure of the Commission.2. The Commission should have power to borrow money (up to a specified limit) by means of stock issued in accordance tvith regulations made by the Board of Trade with the approval of the Treasury.The various possible methods of financing the scheme and the reasons for carrying out the necessary borrowing operations as early as practicable are dealt with in the Appendix.3.--(a) The, Commissions Stock should be a Trustee Security. (b) The Treasury should have power to guarantee the Commission&apos;s loans, and to make any advances that may be necessary pending the issue of a loan.,It is important that the Commission, like the Central Electricity Board, should be able, if necessary, to have a Government guarantee for its stock, in order to be able to make sure of borrowing at a rate that will ensure the solvency of the scheme. But this does not necessarily mean that the guarantee would have to be given.4. The Commission, should be under an obligation to make annual appropriations for redemption of loan and for a reserve fund.The sort of figures that we have in mind are 1 per cent, for redemption and a minimum of  100,000 a year towards building up a reserve fund of  2,000,000. But until we know what has to be paid for the royalties, it is impossible to say whether the scheme can afford this degree of financial prudence.5. The Commission should pay Mineral Rights Duty and Welfare Levy Duty, as well as Income Tax.There will, nevertheless, be an immediate loss of tax equivalent to the difference between the surtax at present payable by royalty owners and that, which will be payable by holders of the Commission^ stock. Its amount even at the outset cannot be calculated precisely it depends on what rate of interest the Commission have to pay but it may be expected to be in the region of  250,000. What the amount of the loss, if any, may be afterwards is quite unascertainable; it depends on a comparison of two things, one of which (the use made of the purchase money) is unidentifiable. &apos; ^We mention this in order that Ministers may consider whether it is desirable to provide for such an additional payment by the Commission to the Exchequer over and above ordinary taxation, as will make good the immediate ascertainable loSS.  . &apos; - -. -In favour of doing this it may be argued that the State, which alone can enable the benefit of unification of royalties to be conferred on the Coal Mining Industry and is asking for no profit for itself, although accepting some risk, is at least entitled to demand that it shall be safeguarded from preventable loss.On the other side it can be argued that if the State deliberately alters a source of taxation, it must accept the consequences in altered receipts from tax;, that it cannot even be said with certainty that the State will lose anything in the long run in this case; much less can the loss be measured; that such a payment could not be fitted into any ordinary canons of taxation, and its amount, and even its. existence, would be an easy target for criticism.
We make ho recommendation as to whether such a payment should be provided for or not, but we think that, if one is provided for, it should be a fixed and arbitrary sum, not given any semblance of a tax or linked with any particular quantum of loss of tax.6. The Commission should keep such accounts as may be prescribed by the &quot;Board of Trade and be subject to audit by auditors appointed by the Board.V.-Administration.1. The Commission should be under tin obligation in granting leases, to reserve, the best rent reasonably obtainable having regard to the rates current in the district.2. It will be the duty of the Commission to meet the following charges on their income: (a) Income Tax, Mineral Rights Duty and Welfare Levy Duty and anadditional Exchequer payment if one is decided on (see IV (5)).(b) Rates (in Scotland).(c) Interest on their stock.(d) Administrative expenses.(e) Appropriations for (i) Redemption of loan. (ii) A reserve fund.3.   Any -surplus income after meeting these charges will be available for (a) Reduction or waiver of charges which are burdensome and exceptional,having regard to, the rates current in the district.(b) General reductions of rents in a district in which they are high by comparison with other districts, having regard to all relevant circumstances including geological conditions and the selling price of coal.(c) Further appropriations to the cancellation of outstanding debt.Here again, it is, of course, impossible to say what the surplus is likely to be until we know what we shall have to pay for the royalties.In the course of anj^ discussions that might take place on any legislative proposals, the query will no doubt be raised whether the long-term policy of the Government is (a) to give the industry the benefit of any profit that may result from the unification of royalties, so that in the long run, if all went well, royalties would virtually disappear, or (b) to use the royalties when the debt has been discharged as a source of State revenue. The question may seem to be, and is, remote, but the danger we apprehend is from the argument that because on -certain assumptions the debt will one day be fully discharged, leaving the royalty income unencumbered, therefore the State can now forthwith make all-round reductions on royalty payments. We have assumed that this is contrary to the views of the Government, and our proposals have been devised so as further to minimise any value that might be attached to such an argument. We suggest, in short, that a decision of the question what is to be done with the royalties when unencumbered should be left until they are in fact unencumbered, and our proposals are framed accordingly.We contemplate a. fixed annual appropriation for redemption. If it were 1 per cent, it would not redeem the debt under 100 years, and even if it were higher it would still take a very substantial period. If the actual loan is for forty, fifty or sixty years, it would not necessarily be fully redeemed by maturity and renewed borrowing by the Commission would then be required. Until the terms on which such borrowing could be effected were known, no sufficient case could be established for a complete revision of the financial arrangements.One result of the choice of a fixed annual redemption is, of course, that the expenditure of the Commission will steadily diminish, as debt is redeemed, ralthough this effect will not be very noticeable in the first five or ten years.Such a reduction in expenditure is some assurance against the possibility of financial failure resulting from a steady decline in coal output; if in fact revenue
does not decline or increases, the fall in expenditure would make available gradually increasing annual sums for securing greater uniformity in royalty rates and for accelerated repayment of debt. An alternative to our proposal would be to make any residual balance each year payable to the Exchequer, but on the whole we prefer that it should be applied to additional debt reduction.4. The Commission should also have power to grant licences to search and bore for coal or to do so themselves.5. A licensee under 4, or the holder of a mineral lease, should normally be expected to secure the necessary surface facilities by agreement, with resort if necessary to the Railway and Canal Commission under the Working Facilities Acts procedure.The Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission should also be given power to make an application to the Railway and Canal Commission under those Acts, if they think fit, as though they were themselves lessees or licensees.6. For the purpose of promoting reorganisation the Reorganisation Commission should have power to cancel any pre-acquisition lease, subject to the payment to the coalowner whose lease is cancelled, by the coalowner or coalowners who are benefited by the cancellation, of such compensation as may be agreed or, in default of agreement, determined by the Railway and Canal Commission.If the possession of royalties is to be used as a weapon in reorganisation (which the Prime Minister has indicated publicly is the Government&apos;s intention), it is important that the Commission should have power in appropriate cases, and subject to proper compensation, either to transfer to X coal which ought to be worked by him but is in fact being worked by Y or to close mines which ought not to be working. This forms part of the recommendations of the Samuel Commission. But such a power clearly needs safeguarding so as to prevent it from creating uncertainty and loss of confidence. The best safeguard, under our proposals, is that it cannot be done unless other coalowners are willing to pay the price, and that the determination of the proper price rests in the last resort with the Court. But the Mining Association are likely to be very sensitive on this point, and it may be that, after negotiation with them, other safeguards will appear desirable and reasonable. We suggest, however, that it is wise to start with an advanced position, if only for the purpose of bargaining, and the recommendations of the Samuel Commission (subscribed to by such moderate people as Sir Herbert Lawrence and Sir Kenneth Lee) give reasonable ground for choosing this one.7. The provisions of the Working Facilities and Support Acts should not apply to property vested in the Commission, except where expressly preserved.The object of these Acts was to compel private royalty owners to be reasonable, and may be presumed to be no longer necessary so far as underground rights are concerned.8. The Commission should make an annual report to the Board of Trade to be laid before Parliament.There are, of course, many points on which we have not touched. But they are mostly technical, not raising questions of policy, and we do not think it necessary to complicate this Report with them.* vIf our suggestions are generally approved, the next steps would be (a) to open negotiations with the royalty owners, and (&amp;) to ask Parliamentary Counsel to draft a. Bill. We would ask for authority to take those steps. We are impressed by the cardinal importance of the negotiations, and think it is worth* For example : Saving for people unable for good reason to apply Within a year.

considering whether it might not be best to bring in an outside expert for instance, an accountant at the head of his profession with instructions to see what are the best terms he could get by agreement, subject, of course, to confirmation by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.We desire to place on record our high appreciation of the valuable assistance which we have received from our Joint Secretaries, Mr. G. H. D: Pryor and Mr. Myrddin Evans. ....ERNEST BROWN,  Chairman.April 3, 1935.
APPENDIX.THE rate of interest to be paid on borrowed money is an essential factor in any financial estimate of the working of the scheme. Any such estimate may be falsified if the market rate of interest should change abruptly during the period of three years or more between the framing of the scheme and the actual payment of compensation. This risk cannot be avoided, but it depends on the form in which compensation is paid to the royalty owners, whether the risk falls on them or on the State. The State may undertake (a) to pay the owners in cash, or (b) to hand to the owners stock of a nominal value equal to the sum awarded, or (c) to hand to the owners such an amount of stock as, being sold at the market price then current, would produce a sum equal to the amount awarded.If the State undertakes to use either method (a) or method&quot;(c), i.e., to pay-cash or in stock on the basis of market price, it will find itself saddled with a severe loss if the rate of interest should rise sharply before the operation is concluded. If method (6) were adopted, i.e., payment in stock to an amount nominally equal to the sum awarded and bearing interest at the rate assumed for the purposes of the scheme, the risk falls on the royalty owner. The latter would not, indeed, fail to obtain even in that case the full income which he was entitled to expect, but he would represent it as a grievance that he received in return for his property stock which could not be sold on the market for an amount equal to the sum awarded to him. No doubt the further argument will he advanced that he is hampered in making fresh arrangements for the manage-ment of affairs owing to uncertainty as to the price he will get for his stock; but this has little force in the present case, since that uncertainty would exist anyhow until the awards are completed at the end of three years.Similar difficulties were experienced in connection with Irish Land Purchase. The Act of 1891 followed course (&amp;); it worked so long as the stock was at a premium, but when the stock fell below par land purchase made no progress. The Act of 1903 provided for course (a), payment in cash, but interest rates continued to rise, and the cost of this arrangement to the State was very heavy. In 1909 the system was again revised; a special arrangement was applied to outstanding cases by which the landlords were offered  108 14s. stock for each  100 cash due, although on the basis of market price they would have received a substantially greater amount of stock. For future cases payment was to be by method (b), i.e., 3 per cent, stock of a nominal value equal to the award.The Irish Land Purchase scheme was, in theory at least, voluntary, whereas the present scheme is compulsory.   The two schemes are, however, alike in the fact that it will not be possible to increase the income of the fund should the -original financial estimates prove unsound.Thus there is only one form of finance which is thoroughly safe, namely, to direct that the vendors be paid whatever is coming to them in the form of stock, such stock to bear interest at the assumed rate and no regard to be had to the question whether the stock stands at a discount at the time it is handed over. The defence for this arrangement would be that the vendors will receive the income they were entitled to expect; either they would retain the stock and receive a gilt-edged income or, if they preferred a higher but more speculative return, they would be in the position to secure it, since the fall in the market rate of, interest would have made every class of security cheaper to purchase.If political considerations should be thought on the whole to rule out this method, the State is accepting the serious risk of a rapid change in interest rates before the scheme can be implemented. Such methods as are available must be adopted to minimise the risk : (1) In the first place, a very cautious view must be taken in the original estimate of the probable cost of raising the money.(2) In the second place, so far as practicable, every effort must be made to raise the cash in advance when interest rates are low. This operation presents technical difficulties, and it would be a question of taking advantage of any opportunities that arose. Large sums of money cannot be simply withdrawn from the market and held idle for three years.   But when cash is required by the Treasury for such purposes
as the redemption of a bond issue, the money could be borrowed from the public by the Commission and re-lent to the Treasury on short-term until required. The Commission would incur some expense, for it would borrow from the public on a stock of say 40 years&apos; life at a long-term rate of interest and re-lend to the Treasury on short-term. That, however, is a limited risk of loss, to which a maximum can be assigned and which must be provided for in advance in the original estimates.(3) It will be exceedingly important to arrange that as much as possible of the money is paid out in advance of the final awards, and it is under-stood that this course can be followed to an important extent. Payment on account may not be altogether free from difficulty, for in practice the payments will tend to be made mainly in respect of the larger and best known properties, to the exclusion of the smallest owners, but it is clear that this minor difficulty, if it cannot be avoided,, must be ignored in the general interests of the scheme.
