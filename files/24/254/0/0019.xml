Proposed reply to German announcement.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe first and natural reaction to the German announcement is to treat the Berlin visit as &quot;off&quot;.That course would have the advantage of avoiding what will probably be an unfruitful excursion, and musl be a very difficult interview to manage.     Moreover, a refusal to go would impress German opinion - but in which direction may in the end be doubtful.     And no doubt a shocked refusal would not be unwelcome to Prance, who would at once urge close Anglo-French-Italian consultation as the alternative.     Indeed, a note delivered by the French Ambassador today enquires whether we do not think that the German statement&apos;of Saturday affects the utility of our proposed visit to Berlin and urges consultation with France and other powers. ...
Powers.Nevertheless, my own view is that we should, not retort toy saying that now we will not go to Berlin. After all, what ultimate end would that serve?   It will not alter the German decision and it will break down whatever contact is left and destroy finally any prospect of agreeing about anything.-    It would toe quite a different matter if excommunicating Germany would lead to a combination to stop her.     On the contrary, it would have quite the opposite effect.But it is impossible to pass over the German declaration in silence.     Even if we wish to do so, the House of Commons will insist on a statement of our view at once.     I propose, therefore, that we should despatch to Germany a note of protest conceived on theS e eannexed   lines annexed2, which will point out the reason why draft,)this German declaration runs so counter to the spirit and purpose of the intended. Berlin meeting and which ends by stating that we will not ourselves abandon any opportunity of promoting general agreement, but that in the new circumstances we desire to know whether the German Government still desires the visit to take place.     Before delivering this note it would be necessary to inform the French and Italian Governments in outline what we were doing.One advantage of the course proposed will be that it prepares public opinion for the position that will arise if the Berlin conversations produce no positive result.     We cannot in the circumstances be blamed forthis, ... -
3Qthis, &quot;but I think we should incur deserved reproach if we treated the latest German action as putting a final end to all possibility of agreement.J, S,FOREIGN OFFICE,17th March, 1935.
n f p&apos; hi w t?MQST^ SECRET. Copy No.......DRAFT.His Majesty&apos;s Government feel bound to convey to the German Government their protest against the public announcement made by the latter on Saturday of the de-cision to adopt conscription and to increase the peace basis of the German army to 36 divisions.   Following upon the announcement of a German air force, such a declaration is a further example of unilateral action, which, apart from the issue of principle, is cal-culated gravely to disturb the prospects of the Anglo-German meeting arranged to take place a week hence. The proposal for that meeting arose out of the terms of the Anglo-French communique of February 3rd and the German reply of February 14th supplemented oy further communications between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the German Government.   His Majesty&apos;s Government con-sider it necessary to call the specific attention of the German Government to the effect of those docu^ ments aThe London cornmiinique of February 3rd, while noting -that armaments limited by treaty could not be modified by unilateral action, declared, that the British and French Governments favoured a general settlement freely negotiated between Germany and other Powers which would.make provisions for the organisa-tion of security in Europe on the lines therein in-dicated, and would simultaneously establish agree-ments about armaments which, in the case of Germany,would . o ... . o
would replace the relevant provisions ox Part V of the Treaty of Versailles,   The communique went on to state that it would he part of the general settlement which it contemplated that Germany would resume her active membership of the League of Nations and proceed-ed to sketch out the terms of an air-pact between the Locarno Powers to operate as a deterrent to aggression and to ensure immunity from sudden attacks from the air oThe German Government1 s reply ten days later welcomed, the spirit of friendly confidence which the Anglo-French communique expressed and. undertook that the German Government would submit to exhaustive examination the questions raised in the first part of the London communique.    It agreed that the spirit, expressed in that communique, of free negotiations between sovereign States could alone lead to lasting international settlements in the sphere of armaments. In particular it welcomed the proposal for an air-pact, and the German reply concluded by saying that before taking part in the proposed negotiations the German Government considered it desirable to clarify, in separate conversations with the Governments con-cerned, a number of preliminary questions of principle.     For this purpose it invited His Majesty&apos;s Government to enter into a direct exchange of views with the German GovernmentsSince His Majesty&apos;s Government desired to make sure that there should be no misunderstanding as to the
scope and. purpose of the proposed Anglo-Gorman meeting, they addressed a further enquiry to the German Govern-me-nt on February 21st to which the German Government replied the next day.   The result was that it was definitely agreed between the two Governments that the object of the&apos;suggested meeting would be to carry consultation a stage further on all the matters re-ferred to in the Anglo-French communique.   It is upon this basis, therefore, that His Majesty&apos;s Government have been preparing to pay the visit to Berlin which the German Government suggested.Thus, what was contemplated was &quot;a general settle-&quot;ment freely negotiated &quot;between Germany and the other &quot;Powers&quot; and &quot;agreements regarding armaments, which in &quot;the case of Germany would, replace the provisions of &quot;part V of the Treaty of Versailles.&quot;The effort to reach a comprehensive agreement which by common consent would take the place of treaty limitations is obviously prejudiced by a formal and unilateral repudiation of treaty obligations and by putting forward as a decision already arrived at vastly increased figures for military effectives - figures, moreover, which, if maintained unaltered, must have the result of making more difficult, if not impossible,the agreement of other Powers also necessarily concerned.His Majesty1s Government are most unwilling to abandon any opportunity which the proposed visit might afford.of promoting general agreement, but in the new circumstances, before undertaking it, they feel bound to call the attention of the German Government to the above considerations and. to enquire whether the German Government still desires the visit to take place.
