FIFTEENTH REPORT.Survey of the economic situation, February 1935.BY our terms of reference we are directed to supervise the preparation of periodical reports on the economic situation; and in accordance with these instructions, we now submit the fifteenth of these periodical reports. The report represents the general views of the committee, without attempting to express the different shades of opinion held by individual members.2. In Part 1, we summarise the chief economic events of recent months. In Part 2, we discuss certain aspects of the present situation.(Signed on behalf of the committee) :J.   0.   ST.A.1VEP.

SURVEY OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION, FEBRUARY 1935.Part 1. Summary of recent economic events.1. STERLING continued to show weakness during December and January, but throughout that period the dollar rate showed a tendency to move more strongly against sterling than the franc rate. This tendency was most marked in the middle of January. The possibility that the American Supreme Court might hold the repudiation of the gold clause in Government bonds to be uncon-stitutional established, for a time, a belief that the devaluation of the dollar might be reversed. In view of this possibility, arbitrage houses were unwilling to take the risk of shipping gold to New York. In consequence, the franc doHar exchange rate immediately moved beyond the gold export point. Reflection, however, suggested that even an adverse decision would not affect the value of the dollar, and the dollar franc rate returned to a more normal level, though this was partly due to the belated intervention of the American exchange control. The incident is, perhaps, chiefly of importance as an illustration of the extremely unstable nature of the present level of exchange between New York and Paris. In the following tables, table 1 and table 2, we give the recent exchange rates on New York and Paris : Table 1.Average of mean daily rates of exchange in 1933 and 1934.	New York Dollars to &amp;.

The possibility of an appreciation of the dollar in terms of gold to which we alluded above brought a certain amount of gold previously hoarded in this country into circulation. Exports of gold for the four weeks ending the 7th February exceeded the imports into this country by  7,401,000. This must be compared with a net import of gold into Great Britain amounting to  133,400,000, valued at the current price, in the year 1934.4. Short-term rates of interest have continued to be very low. Up to Christmas, when discount houses were influenced by prospective shortage of credit over the new year, the rates for Treasury bills varied between 9*. and 11s. per cent. Since the end of the year rates have been considerably less, the rate on the 25th January having fallen to 3s. lid. per cent., the lowest rate recorded. The latest issue (for the 23rd February) was affected by the new temporary arrangement entered into by the clearing banks to abstain from buying or tendering for bills at rates below that charged by them for money market loans and was allotted an average rate of 8s. Ad. per cent. The low short-term rates of interest are in part accounted for by increased buying of bills by the clearing banks. ^Their holdings of these have risen from  213 millions in September to  284 millions in January, though this rise is in part accounted for by the inclusion of bonds called for redemption under the heading of &quot;discounts&quot; instead of under &quot;investments&quot; as formerly. The clearing banks have also been able to expand their other assets, with the result that their deposits have risen to  1,982 millions, at which level they almost equal the high point of  1,983 millions reached in December 1932. The principal assets and liabilities of the clearing banks are given in the following table: 2. As a result of the comparative weakness of the franc, the Bank of France has7experienced&apos; some loss1 of gold, its holding falling from 82,124 million francs on the 28th December to 81,880 million francs on the 1st February. The decrees promulgated in Italy requiring the registration of holdings of foreign currencies, and giving the Bank of Italy the right to acquire such holdings from corporations, have had the effect of checking the loss of gold. Indeed, the Bank of Italy has even been able to add slightly to its gold holdings in the last few weeks. The gold holding of the principal European central banks are given in the following table. It will be observed that both Holland and Switzerland lost -appreciable quantities of gold in January:

The market for securities continued strong throughout January, the partly speculative rise in prices which followed the breakdown of the pact between the principal clearing banks to maintain a minimum rate of discount having been fully sustained. In February, however, there was a relapse, which was attributable in part to uncertainty over the political situation, in part to the collapse of speculative positions in certain minor commodity markets, notably in that for pepper. The market was the less able to resist these influences as a number of issues in the gilt-edged market at the new level of interest rates had been badly received by the public, and a large proportion left with underwriters.

French prices have been affected by the fall in the price of wheat brought about by recent legislation; and in Germany the rising tendency of prices has been checked, partly, no doubt, by the activities of the price controller. In the United States, on the other hand, there has been a sharp upward movement of prices, which is largely due to the delayed effects of last summer&apos;s drought. A number of agricultural commodities have been in rather ghort supply, and agricultural prices have now reached &quot; parity &quot; with industrial prices, with 1926 as the base year.

It will be observed that in the last quarter of 1934 employment followed its normal seasonal course; the January figure, however, shows a distinct recession.8. Building plans approved by local authorities in the last quarter of 1934 showed an increase of 11-4 per cent, compared with 1933. The preliminary figures for January 1935 show an increase of 15-7 per cent, compared with 1934.9. The output of steel in Great Britain in December amounted to 654,500 tons compared with 668,900 tons in 1933. In November the output was 766,000 tons-in 1934, compared with 695,000 in 1933. For the whole year of 1934 output amounted to 8,859,700 tons, an increase of 26 per cent, over 1933. The output in 1934 was only surpassed in the war years and in the years 1920, 1927 and 1929, in which last year it amounted to 9,636,200 tons. Steel production in January amounted to 757,800 tons compared with 711,000 in January 1934. The consumption of steel in Great Britain is given in the following table (table 9) :

In the fourth quarter of 1934 the Board of Trade&apos;s index of industrial production stood at 116 per cent, of the average for the year 1924. This showed an increase of 10-5 per cent, over the same quarter in 1933, Compared with an increase of 9-5 per cent, in the third quarter and of 13-1 per cent, in the second quarter. The index for the year stands at 110-5 compared with 98-6 in 1933, an increase of 12-1 per cent.11. Retail trade for December showed an increase of 1-8 per cent, when compared with 1933. For November the increase was 3 - 9 per cent. The following table (table 10) gives the average daily value of retail sales for each month since the beginning of 1932 : Table 10.Value of average daily retail sales in Great Britain reported to the Bank ofEngland since 1932.(Average for the year 1933 = 100.)Month.

accounted for by the increased production of motor-cars. President roosevelt&apos;s budget message envisages continual heavy expenditure on public works and on relief in 1935. The appropriation for relief and public works amounts to nearly  1,000 millions. President Roosevelt hopes by extending the expenditure upon public works to reduce the necessity for the large expenditure upon relief which characterised the current financial year. The budget, in spite of the heavy borrowing which it contemplates, had small effect upon the price of Government securities.

Recent trade statistics suggest that since the last of these figures was published the improvement they show has been at least maintained.

The improvement in business activity has been accompanied by higher prices in the bond market and in the market for industrial shares, though the latter has been affected by anxiety regarding the coming judgment over the gold clause.

In France, following the announcement of changes in financial policy,, there was a considerable improvement in the prices of securities, which has not, however, been fully maintained. Though there has been some improvement in financial confidence, there is so far little sign that the deterioration in the industrial situation has come to an end. Production in October was at a lower level than in September, while between October and November there appears to have been no change.

The slight setback in German production which was apparent at the time of our last report does not seem to have developed. The index of production in November and December was slightly higher than in October, though the index remains below the level reached in June and July. The falling off in activity is most apparent in the industries producing consumers&apos; goods. There appears to have been some improvement in the level of building activity. [11200] c 2

Though the value of world trade as a whole continues to be below the level of 1933, different groups of countries have not experienced the same fortune. In the following table (table 17) an analysis is made of the experience, since 1929, of six major groups of countries which in the aggregate are responsible for 95 per cent, of the total world trade. The sterling area in these tables consists of those countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia whose currencies are linked with sterling. The gold bloc group includes colonial possessions of France, Holland and Belgium and certain European countries linked with the gold bloc. The names of the. countries in each group are given in the footnote to the table.

An -exception, however, is made in the case of the sterling area. In the third quarter of 1934 gold -exports from South Africa (which for that country are included among exports of commodities) were substantially reduced by exceptional causes. In the estimate of the year 1934 account is taken of this fact, and the percentage of 30-9 given for the sterling area is the percentage which -would have been attained if gold exports had been normal.

Although it appears from the above table that the sterling group was-experiencing a growing adverse balance of trade since the first quarter of 1934, the increase in the British adverse balance of trade had recently been much less marked. In December, though British exports showed a satisfactory increase of 12-8 per cent, over 1933, retained imports were rather lower than in December 1933 as a result of lower importation of raw wool and cotton. The increase in British exports each month since the beginning of 1934 in comparison with the corresponding month in the previous year is given in the following table-(table 18) :-Table 18.The monthly increase in British exports since January 1934 as a percentage of the exports in the corresponding months in the previous year.
Part 2.-The present economic situation.21. The broad effect of a survey of the economic developments of the past quarter is that there has been a certain hesitation in the process of recovery.. In. the last three months of 1934 employment followed its normal seasonal course. In January, however, it showed a recession which was appreciably greater than is usual at this time of year. It is, perhaps, unwise to attach too great significance to the figure for January employment, as in that month the statistics are influenced in a peculiar degree by seasonal factors. For example, unemployment in distribution, which appears to have been particularly unsatisfactory, may have been influenced by the late date of the count this year. Recent railway traffic receipts have also been disappointing, though a partial explanation for this may be found in the decline in coal carried as a consequence of the exceptionally mild weather. On the other hand, the index of industrial production continues to be satisfactory, and activity in the capital goods industries appears to be well sustained. In spite of disappointing figures in December, steel production and building plans approved showed a substantial improvement over the previous year both in the last quarter of 1934 and in January 1935.22. In our recent reports we called attention to the depressing effect of the international situation on the British industrial position. It is, on the whole, a matter for congratulation that, in spite of this, the year 1934 should have closed without an industrial setback. If the conditions of internal recovery ;can be maintained, we may look for some further expansion of industrial activity this year, provided that conditions abroad are of a helpful nature. We turn, therefore, to examine the probable trend of external events and of their repercussion on our economy.23. The net income which this country receives from abroad is affected not only by the balance of trade of this country alone, but also by the balance of trade of the whole group of sterling countries, which together constitute the area in which the greater part of British investments have been made. An improvement in the trading position of, for example, British Malaya is immediately reflected in the increased income of a large number of British shareholders. Thus, when the trading position of the sterling area improves, there is likely to be a corresponding improvement in the income available for expenditure in this country. The year 1933, which saw the beginning of the revival of trade in Great Britain, was, from the point of view of the sterling area, as a whole, a year of exceptionally good fortune. Not only in this country, but in America, in Germany, and even in France, there was a strong demand for the raw materials of industry in the expectation of a substantial revival of business. In consequence, the internal forces making for recovery in this country were able to work in very favourable surroundings. Last year, however, this position was reversed. For a number of reasons the expected improvement -abroad could not be maintained, and the demand for raw materials, of wool in particular, fell off.24. There is growing evidence of the gradual deterioration of the exchange position in the sterling area. In the first part of this report (table 17) we have given figures showing the movements of the gold value of the external trade of Countries responsible for over 95 per cent, of the total of world trade, divided into six main groups. This table shows that since 1931 the sterling area has been responsible for an increasing share of the total of world trade. But whereas in 1932. and 1933 exports from the sterling area increased relatively to their imports, in the first three, quarters of 1934, imports increased considerably faster than exports,&apos;. and in the third quarter of 1934, the last for which figures are; available, this tendency was very much accentuated, even when allowance is made, for the fact that, exports in that quarter were affected by the low level of gold exports from South Africa. It is also apparent from this table that the principal cause of this change has been the restriction of imports by the -countries of the European gold bloc. A second, but less important, factor has been the increase&apos;in the share of total exports which has been secured by North America, as a -result of: an improved competitive position in certain markets! and of the higher prices which certain important primary products secured last year.
25. The relative prosperity which the sterling area enjoyed in the year 1934 was clearly&apos; of the greatest importance in maintaining the volume of world trade. But it inevitably placed some strain upon the sterling exchanges, which, thanks to the favourable &quot;trading conditions which had prevailed in 1933,* it proved well within their capacity to bear. Though this position cannot be maintained indefinitely, the course of events in America, and to some extent also in France, gives some reason to hope that in the near future this strain may be relaxed without any serious disturbance of the existing levels of the sterling exchanges.26. We discussed the prospects of American recovery at some length in our last report. The revival of activity to which we then referred appears to be making satisfactory headway. President roosevelt&apos;s message to Congress and its reception by the business community suggest that the expansive policy pursued by the American government will be continued throughout 1935, and that it is unlikely to generate any serious feeling of distrust similar to that which in 1934 so largely dissipated the good effects which it might otherwise have been expected to produce. Moreover, the constant increase in the assets of the Federal Reserve Banks is now reflected in the figures for the.deposits of the banking system as. a whole; and the improved liquidity of the public which this indicates is likely to be associated with a greater willingness to spend. The motor trade indeed is already benefiting from increased public demand. On the other hand, the uncertainty which was generated by the discussion of the constitutional validity of the repudiation of the gold clause by Congress, served to emphasise the unsettling influence which the administration^ monetary policy still exerts on the business situation. Nevertheless, at any rate during the first part of this year, the revival of activity which has taken place should render the United States a buyer of imported goods on a more substantial scale than in 1934. This-tendency should be reinforced by the deferred effects of last summer&apos;s drought. The livestock population of the United States has been very heavily reduced. This should lead not only to heavier imports of various animal products, such as wool and leather, but also to smaller exports of lard, hams and bacon, in which the United States still maintains a considerable export trade.(a) A change of policy in France.27. We turn to consider what favourable reactions, if any, may be expected from the recent modification of French financial policy. French policy is dominated by two irreconcilable popular demands. On the one hand the value of the franc is to be maintained at all costs; not merely by adhering to the present gold parity, but by avoiding any financial expedient which might ultimately have an inflationary effect. On the other hand, the government is required to protect the individual Frenchman at every point from the consequences of economic depression. The prices he receives are to be maintained; but the cost of living is to be reduced. He is not to pay greater taxes; but his pension and his salary are to be maintained. Finally, the state is to intervene to provide him with employment, both by excluding foreign goods and by a large programme of public works.28. The demands made upon the financial resources of the government by this policy of relief have naturally been very heavy. During the coming year the treasury will probably have to borrow fifteen millard francs, or  200,000,000 at the present rate of exchange. This is a sum which, having regard to the relative size and wealth of the two countries, is of the same order of magnitude as the relief expenditure in the United States. The greater part of this deficit, indeed, does not appear directly in the national budget. For example, three or four milliards will be required in 1935 to finance the deficit of the railways, a. deficit which is principally due to the very heavy taxation of railway receipts. The loans necessary to meet this deficit will not be issued by the treasury, though they will carry a treasury guarantee both as to interest and principal.29. Government borrowing upon the present scale would require careful handling even if the state could count upon the co-operation of a well-organised banking system. But the French money market is neither well organised nor co-operative, and the cost of government borrowing has become unduly expensive..
The bonds issued last autumn showed a yield of 5^ per cent., though the terms of redemption afforded the subscriber exceptional advantages. These high interest rates have not only proved a great embarrassment to the government; they have, also interfered with the normal course of private investment. Building activity to-day attains less than 60 per cent, of the level of 1930, when it was encouraged by very much lower rates of interest. Thus the measures which the Government, is taking to relieve the crisis are, thanks to the imperfections of the financial machine, themselves responsible for an accentuation of the depression.30. It is natural that in these circumstances the government should consider seriously the possibility of improving economic conditions by a modification of financial policy. But progress in this direction is hampered at every turn by the almost morbid fear of inflationary expedients which affects not only the leaders of financial opinion, but the great majority of the general public as well.. Nevertheless, the growing severity of the economic crisis has persuaded the Government to take a few tentative steps to ease the present stringency of credit.31. The actual change in procedure which led to the resignation of M. Moret from the governorship of the Bank of France concerns , the; rediscounting of treasury bills by that institution, and the granting of temporary advances on treasury bonds. These functions have always been within the competence of the Bank of France; but . Moret during his term of office was Only willing to help the French banks under conditions which effectively deterred them from seeking the assistance of the Bank of France in this way except in circumstances of extreme urgency. As a consequence it has not been possible for the French deposit banks to look upon their holdings of treasury bills and. bonds as a second line of defence against possible drains upon them; and they have been forced to secure their liquidity, by holding preserves of cash which, according to English ideas, are excessive. The conditions under which the Bank: of France will be prepared to rediscount treasury bills and make advances on. treasury bonds are now to be relaxed, and it is hoped that the deposit banks will, acquire an increased holding of them, and will reduce their present excessive; holdings of Cash in proportion. The cash thus released would then be available-to form the basis of an expansion of bank credit, without the central bank undertaking any open market operations which might, however unreasonably, serve to alarm public opinion. The treasury&apos;s programme of borrowing for the-current year has been framed upon these assumptions. Immediate requirements, are to be met by an increase in the volume of treasury bills, and the legal limit on the issue of these has therefore been raised from 10 to 15 milliard francs. It is the intention of the government to abstain from borrowing on long term until the expansion of bank credit has had the effect of strengthening the market for government securities.32. Modest though this change in procedure is, it has not escaped opposition. The new governor of the Bank of France is having difficulty&apos; in persuading the Court, of Regency to allow him to put it into execution; and the deposit banks themselves are showing some reluctance to take up the new bills at reasonable rates. The government has also been unfortunate in the circum-stances in which the change came into operation; for the disturbance of the exchanges which has followed the gold clause litigation in America has temporarily sent up the price of short-term funds. Nevertheless, the urgency of the governments need will force them to persevere in their policy, even though this involves them in some conflict with the financial interests, and they are probably in a position to make their will prevail. If there is a reduction in French long-term rates of interest, and on the whole we are hopeful that there will be, there should be some recovery in the level of French economic activity this year, even though the present exchange parities are maintained.i 33. In view of the grave uncertainty that surrounds the future of the franc,, it is natural that the question, whether the new policy is likely to bring devalua-tion a stage nearer, should have been actively canvassed. The current balance of payments is in all probability favourable to France. The unfavourable balance of France and her colonies has been estimated at under 3 milliard francs for 1933. In 1934 the French visible adverse balance of trade with foreign countries diminished by nearly 4  milliard francs, so that if there was no adverse change in the other factors (and; except for a possible reduction in tourist expenditure there [11200] d&apos;
is little reason to suppose.that there was), the year .1934 must, have seen a modest &apos; favourable balance of payments. Any increase in French industrial activity corn-pared with that prevailing in the rest of the world would inevitably reduce this favourable balance, and, if it were appreciable, might possibly convert it irfto an adverse balance. In that event, the Bank.of France would suffer some drain of gold, and in view of the nervousness of the1 French as to the stability of the franc, this might cause a return to a deflationary monetary policy, and a diminution of economic activity generally.34. Thus the success of the new financial policy will largely depend on whether or not it will be possible to secure a revival of activity in France without bringing about a drain of gold of sufficiently serious dimensions to excite popular alarm. In our previous reports we have discussed the prospects of a devaluation of the franc, and we have taken the view that ultimately this is on balance to be expected. At the moment, however, we are only concerned with the immediate outlook. And from this point of view there are good reasons for holding that the new policy will not be defeated by developments of this nature. In the first place there is at present some margin in the French balance of payments. Secondly, as we have seen, the decrease in the visible adverse balance of trade of the gold bloc countries has already proceeded to such lengths as seriously to weaken the position of sterling, and to hamper recovery in the sterling area. If a French revival resulted in greater purchases of materials produced within the sterling area, recovery elsewhere would be accelerated, and thus a substantial absolute revival in France might result in a comparatively small improvement relative to the rest of the world. In that event the worsening of the French balance of payments associated with a revival of French activity would be sensibly diminished. Finally, the existence of large stocks of gold hoarded by Frenchmen might, if the outlook in France improved, provide valuable support to the official gold reserve. For with improved prospects of employing funds at home, the com-parative attractions of speculating in gold would be diminished, and a certain number of gold hoarders would be tempted to sell gold for francs.35. The new financial policy is hardly likely to give rise to a very large revival of French economic activity, and the considerations which we have set out in the preceding paragraph afford good grounds for supposing that it will not place an undue strain upon the stability of the franc. Moreover, in so far as the depression is lightened thereby its success is likely to promote internal confidence and political stability, both of which are of far greater consequence to the future of the franc than the loss of one or two milliards from the immense gold reserves of the Bank of France. It is our view, therefore, that should it really prove feasible materially to reduce long-term interest rates by the financial devices which the French ^government proposes to adopt, the immediate effect will be to render the franc more, rather than less, secure. If, however, the government should fail in their declared object, a possibility which the strong opposition they are encountering makes by no means improbable, an abandonment of the present high value of the franc would appear to be a necessary prelude to a revival of internal confidence.(b) Interest rates and home employment.36. The development of internal policy in the United States at least, and conceivably also in France, gives some grounds for hoping that the adverse balance of payments in the sterling area that has marked the last six months will be somewhat mitigated in the immediate future and that activity in Great Britain will benefit accordingly. But unless financial conditions in Great Britain itself remain favourable to recovery, it would be idle to look for a substantial advance based upon an improvement in external conditions alone. The internal conditions to which we refer are on the one hand the maintenance at their present low level of interest rates, as determined by the prices of securities quoted on the stock exchange, and on the other hand the ease with which borrowers are able to obtain funds at these rates. Since the beginning of 1933 the prices of securities have shown on the whole a sustained upward tendency, and the maintenance of low long-term interest rates, in. spite of occasional set-backs, , has never been seriously questioned. Recent events, however, have suggested that interest rates have now fallen to a point at which the market for securities is definitely vulnerable.   If this is the case a continuous improvement
in. British economic activity, based on a constant adjustment of--.long-term interest rates to *the level called for by the growing volume of new saving, may become increasingly difficult, to effect.37. We do not believe that the prevailing interest rates are lower than is necessary to achieve equilibrium in the supply and demand for saving over a long period. It is not, therefore, our view that some reaction from the present high level of security prices- is inevitable as trade improves. But it is not incompatible with this view to hold that for some months at any rate the market may be subject to influences which may make a further rise in security prices or even their maintenance at their present level extremely difficult to achieve.38. Before we discuss these adverse influences we may point out that there is one respect in which the market is to-day in a much stronger position than was the case in the summer and autumn of 1934. In our twelfth report we called attention to the decline which had taken place in the level of bank deposits in comparison with the previous year. In the latter half of 1934 this tendency was reversed and bank deposits almost regained the high level which prevailed at the end of 1932. The liquid funds available for the investing public as a result of this rise add substantially to the underlying strength of the market.39. Some of the factors which render the market vulnerable have been operative ever since the rise in security prices began in 1932. Interest rates in this country are in general very much lower than those on comparable securities in the other important monetary centres. We have already referred to the high rates obtainable on French government stocks, rates which are as much as twice those obtainable in this country. The discrepancy exists, though in a less marked degree, between London rates and those obtainable in the United States, and in Holland. These discrepancies are, of course, only possible because the risk of capital loss through an appreciation of the pound more than outweighs the attraction of the higher yield. But though the connection between home and foreign interest rates is much less close now that the element of exchange uncertainty is so very grave, it still exists. If funds left this country for invest-ment abroad the gilt-edged market would suffer. So long, therefore, as high interest rates prevail on the continent and in the United States, the London market will remain in a vulnerable position.40. But though the gilt-edged market is exposed to this risk, it would be easy to attach too great importance to it. The discrepancy between rates at home and abroad may disappear as well from a fall of the latter as from a rise of the former, e.g., it is equally possible that 3 per cent, rentes may move up from their present price of 82 as that Local Loans may move down from their present price of 97. Such a movement might indeed be anticipated with confidence if the factor of exchange risk were to diminish in importance. It should be remembered that the same forces which are responsible for the present degree of exchange uncertainty are also in a large measure responsible for the low level of securities abroad. A return to orthodoxy on the part of President Roosevelt would no doubt increase the willingness of English investors to buy American securities; but it would equally diminish the willingness of their present American holders to dispose of them.41. The gilt-edged market is also exposed to the risk that the banks and other financial institutions which at present hold a very much larger proportion of their resources in investments than they would do in times when the industrial and commercial demand for credit was at a more normal level, will dispose of their holdings as trade improves. Here again it may well happen that as trade improves the new savings of the community will absorb the investments disposed of by the banks without any fall in price being necessary.42. Recently, however, it has become clear that the gilt-edged market is likely to be increasingly affected by political considerations. The life of the present Parliament has at most eighteen months to run and in view of the uncertainties of a general election the market is apprehensive whether the new Parliament will give the same support to the policies necessary for the main--tenance of low rates of interest.   So long as this uncertainty overhangs the
market any attempt to establish, lower rates of interest on government securities must expect to encounter considerable resistance.43. On the other hand it is probably still possible to enlarge the influence of low interest yields of stock exchange securities by extending them to other forms of borrowing. For before low interest rates can be fully effective they must penetrate into every field of investment and saving. Many rates are not auto-matically affected by changes in the yields of securities quoted on the stock exchange. For example, the effective rate of interest in the field of house building is the rate charged by building societies. Small businesses raise money by bank loans or upon mortgages. The investor, especially the investor on a small scale, has a number of opportunities for making loans at what are compara-tively attractive rates of interest. National Savings certificates afford what must now be regarded as a high yield. The Post Office Savings Bank offers 1\ per cent, to depositors and this rate-naturally influences the rates offered by building societies and the like. Insurance policies, again, assisted as they are by the tax rebates allowed on premiums, are able to offer terms which afford a fairly high rate of interest on money invested in this way. In the aggregate these are the rates at which a very substantial share of new lending takes place; but the market rate of interest determined by the yield on stock exchange securities exerts only a slow and indirect influence upon them.44. Moreover, even within the field in which they are directly operative, it is not Until the new rates of interest oh stock exchange securities have been established for some time that.they are accepted as permanent and form the basis of industrial decisions. These are the reasons which deter those responsible for building societies, insurance companies, and the like from adjusting their rates for interest, premiums, and charges too quickly to a new level of interest rates which may hot be maintained. The effective rate on hew borrowing may consequently be expected to lag behind the current market rate.45. If, however, the rate of interest on gilt-edged securities is maintained firmly at a low level, the process of reduction will gradually spread itself through these subsidiary rates. The important point, therefore, with regard to the gilt-edged market, is not so much that it should be kept moving upwards, as that it should retain such a degree of stability at a high level as will strengthen the conviction that low rates of interest, at something not far removed from the present level, have been permanently established. While, therefore, a substantial fall in Government securities might exert serious repercussions upon industrial activity, it is possible that, if this can be avoided, the beneficial effects of lower interest rates may make themselves felt increasingly, even though gilt-edged securities fail to recover the peak prices reached early in the year.46. There are grounds for holding that the comparatively slight progress which has been made in the last quarter of 1934 is not necessarily an indication that the forces making for recovery have now spent themselves. We are, however, at a point where the forces of the recovery and the; opposing tendencies are fairly matched, and we cannot predict the outcome with any clear confidence. There-are no definite grounds for pessimism, but we cannot afford tb neglect any opportunity of stimulating confidence and employment.o
