(THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S QOVERMMEWT).CABINET.Battersea Power Station.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.SECRET. COPY NO.3*7*.. . .OP. 70(35).I desire to bring to the notice of the Cabinet an application by the London Power Company for the consent &amp;f the Electricity Commissioners to the installation of three additional boiler units at the Battersea Station, involving the removal of the present limitation imposed on the coal consumption at the Station.In February, 1927, the London Power Company made application to the Electricity Commissioners for consent to the establishment of the first section of the Battersea generating station which it was then contemplated would have an ultimate capacity of 360,000 kilowatts.     The Commissioners held a public Inquiry and, after consultation with the Office of Works (whose separate approval was required by and given to the Company under the Lcndon Electric Supply Act of 1908), issued their consent to the establishment of the station to contain initially 120,000 kw. of generating plant (two 60,000 kw. sets) with the necessary boilers, etc., subject to the condition that the Company should take the best known precautions for the due consumption of smoke and for preventing as far as reasonably practicable the evolution of oxides of sulphur and for preventing any nuisance arising from the station or from any operation thereat...Following the issue of the consent, various bodies raised the question of the possible effect on public amenities and health and the matter formed the subject of a number of questions in Parliament, as the
result of which Lord Londonderry,  the then First Commissioner of Works, gave an undertaking in April, 1929 that the question of any further extension would come within the purview of Parliamentj    that if objections were brought forward that the station was not working satisfactorily Parliament would have the opportunity of expressing its opinion whether the station should be further extended? and that this undertaking should be implemented by consultation between the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Health, and the First Commissioner of Works so that steps could be taken to draw the attention of both Houses to the matter.At the same time, the Minister of Transport instructed the Commissioners to 8.sk the Government chemist in conjunction with technical representatives of other Departments to investigate and report on the measures proposed to he adopted by the Company at Battersea to obviate the emission of oxides of sulphur.     A report by the Government Chemist&apos;s Committee on the results of an experimental plant at the Grove Road, power Station of the Power Company was presented to parliament in November, 1929, and an undertaking given that the full scheme would not be sanctioned until the Committee had further reported that adequate measures could and would be taken to avoid danger from the emission of sulphur fumes.The Second Report of the Government Chemist&apos;s Committee was presented to Parliament In November, 1930j and in a prefatory note it was stated that it had been
irr, r%ascertained from the Committee that they were satisfied that it was practicable to install plant at the Battersea Station which would reduce the emission of sulphur fumes to a negligible quantity.In October, 1933* the Company applied for consent to install an additional generator set of 100,000 kilowatts to he utilised in conjunction with the existing sets for standby purposes only;    no extension of boiler plart or buildings was involved;    and it was represented that the additional set would enable the operations at Bow and Grove Road Stations to be considerably restricted.This proposal wa3 taken up with the Departmentsconcerned, and with the Public Authorities, etc., who had previously raised questions concerning public amenities.Also an inspection of the gas washing plant installed atthe Battersea Station was made by the Government Ghemist&apos;sCommittee who reported on 23rd February, 1933 -&quot;that the Committee were impressed with the magnitude of this elimination plant as indeed they were with the whole station, and they see no reason to believe that this extrapolation of the method employed in Grove Road, with the subsequent improvements gained by later experience there, should not prove satisfactory in securing the reduction of sulphur fumes emitted to a negligible quantity especially as the design is capable of utilising variations in process without alteration to the plant-&quot;After consideration of the observations on the further proposal, the Commissioners informed my predecessor that they would propose to attach to their consent to the additional 100,000 kilowatt set a condition limiting the output from the station in any one year to 720,000,000 units*    This
condition weulol airt-omai7i^alJy^i%erv-eirb-jth^- -xjonsumption ofa greater amount cf coal at the station than was possible under the previous consents with the smaller amount of generating plant.The matter was brought before the Cabinet in a Memorandum (CP.91(33)  dated 3rd April, 1933), in which itindicated that the Commissioners were satisfied that by the installation of the additional set at Battersea under theconditions proposed, there would be a substantial reduction in coal consumption at Grove Road and Buw generating stations of the Power Company, and that owing to thehigher efficiency of the new set the coal consumption atthe Battersea Station itself would be less than the amount which would have been consumed in producing the sameoutput from the existing plant.The authority of the Cabinet was subsequently given to the issue of the necessary consent embodying the limiting conditions as to the user of the station; and my predecessor made a statement on the position in reply to a question in the House of Commons on 10th April, 1933.The consent was issued on 17th April, 1933.During the past few years the growth of load in the South East England area has been steadily increasing, and is likely to continue.     To enable the Grid Scheme in this part of the Country to be developed on sound technical lines and on the most economical basis, it is essential that tho Station should be extended from time to time up to its full capacity so as to deal with its proper
proportion of the growth of load in the area.A third Heport received from the Government Chemist&apos;s Committee on 15th October, 1954-, and published as a Command Paper (Cmd.4771) in December last expresses satisfaction with the actual results achieved under ordinary working conditions by the sulphur elimination plant installed at the Station;    records the opinion that the Company have adopted &quot;the best known means of preventing as far as reasonably practicable the evolution of oxides of sulphur&quot;;    and states that the Committee would see no objection to the installation of the three additional boilers subject to the same conditions of working as apply to the existing boilers.The Report has been considered by the first commissioner of Works and the Minister of Health whohave intimated -&quot;that the present proposal for the installation of three further boilers should be reported to the Cabinet before any approval is given by the Electricity Commissioners;    that such approval if sanctioned by the Cabinet, should be subject to the conditions imposed by the Commissioners with regard to the existing plant and that they generally agree with the Committee&apos;s recommendation that sanction for the completion of the station should be given only on conditions framed in the light of the latest technical developments as to the removal of sulphur from flue gases&quot;.The Electricity Commissioners are satisfied, having regardto the terms of the Committee&apos;a Report on the gas-washingplant, that the present restriction on the output ofelectricity at the Battersea station can now be withdrawn and that consent to the installation of the three
*3 n Oti y Oadditional boiler units can be given on the conditions suggested by the Committee,In view of the undertaking given by the Electricity Commissioners in 1932 to the London County Council and the Westminster, Chelsea and Kensington Borough Councils that they should be given adequate opportunity to consider any subsequent proposals for the further development of the Battersea station,  the observations of these Councils were invited by the Commissioners on the present application.The Councils met in conference and agreed that in view of the terms of the Government Chemist&apos;s Committee^ Report and of the result of the London County Council&apos;s own observations as to the amount of sulphur di-oxide in the air at Battersea P?rk since 19J2, it would be difficult to oppose the proposed extension of the station on the grounds of danger to public health. The local authorities recommended, however,  that the consent of the Electricity Commissioners to the installation of the additional boilers required to complete the first half of the Battersea station should only be given on conditions similar to those imposed by the Commissioners on the Fulham Borough Council in 1931 in connection with the extension of the Fulham generating station.      (See conditions set out in the draft consent attached).The Fulham conditions as to the avoidance of nuisance are more detailed than those attached to the original consent given to the London Power Company in 1927;    and the proposal that the Fulham conditions should
Li   H-3.Ministry of Transport. 1st April, ,1-55.be attached to any consent to the installation of the three additional boilers has formed the subject of correspondence between the Electricity Commissioners and the London Power Company.The Power Company have intimated that in view of their record in connection with the flue gas-washing problem, they regret the attitude adopted towards them but intimate that in the circumstances no useful purpose would appear to be served by the Company resisting the proposals.In agreement with the Minister of Health and the First Commissioner of Works, I therefore seek the concurrence of the Cabinet -(a) to a statement on the position being made in Parliament in view of the pledge given by the then First Commissioner of Works (Lord Londonderry) in April,  1939;  -and(b) to the removal of the present restriction on the output of the new Battersea station and to the sanctioning by the Electricity Co: unissioners of the three additional boiler units subject to the attachment of the more detailed Fulham conditions as to the avoidance of nuisance (draft form of consent attached).
