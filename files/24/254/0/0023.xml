f*s not reproduced.SECRET. C0.S-.567.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE. CHIEFS OF STAFF SUB-COMMITTEE.MM1A.0.Japanese offer to Government of Portuguese Colony of Macao to buy large Concession there including the development of a new_inland   port.I.Copy of a telegram from the Governor of Hong Kong to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated March 15th,  1955.Addressed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies No.  65 of the 15th March, repeated to Peking Mission Canton Trade Commissioner.Your telegram   No.  33 Be gins %    Generally project if carried, would almost certainly give Japan measure of control in Macao which would appear to he most undesirable from the point of view of Great Britain and this Colony. It might well enable Japan to exert pressure in South China in order- to increase trade  therewith through Macao at the expense of the present Hong Kong trade.Very doubtful if Macao could be principal deep-sea port but it could at some expense be  dredged to take  ships (corrupt group)  ? up to 5,000 tons leading to probable diversion from Hong Kong of much coastal (corrupt group) Japanese shipping.      Macao has considerable reclaimed area which might be used for aerodrome probably to the prejudice of Hong Kong (corrupt group ? aviation) and other interests.If Great Britain assisted in the matter of the waterworks Macao might well resist other proposals.
Note prepared in the Colonial&apos; off ice,The Japanese hare made an offer to the Government of the Portuguese Colany of MacaoH for a contract -(l)  to build a waterworks at a cost of $1,508,000; (2) to purchase the whole site of a new inlandport  (for several million dollars cash) ; (3)  to establish and operate a line of 2,030 toncargo steamers to run between Hong Kong -Canton - Timor; (4) to pay off existing debts of establishedindustries..In the opinion of the Macao Government all this would mean prosperity for that Colony * but they are afraid that it would also mean virtual Japanese control of the territory.Macaoj it is claimed;, has excellent aerodrome sites and a new harbour which could give a depth of 20 feet after short period of dredging.      Deep water facilities for shipping already exist at Colowan Island., which is a small island near Macao and included in that Portuguese Colony.For many years the Macao Electric Light Works has been controlled by a British Managing Director (Mr. Gal lion) who has for years past been the chief British resident in that Colony.      In January he went to the Consul General at Canton at the urgent request of thex   Some 40 miles from Kong Kong and 80 from Canton off the mouth of the Canton Kiver.
Governor ef Macao to give t&apos;he information about the Japanese application.      It is supposed that the G-evernor &apos; s idea was &apos;&apos;to give British interests an opportunity to counter Japanese economic penetration in South China area&quot; .Mr.  Gal I ion and his associates  (presumably British) are said to have made an offer to take over the waterworkss but&apos; cannot rase the necessary money on account of &quot;the depression and uncertainty&quot;.      The Kong Kong and Shanghai Bank are unwilling to advance the money unless guaranteed by the British Government  or  the Government of Bong Kong.No recommendations for action have yet arrived here either, from the Governor at Kong Kong or His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking^ except that the former in his latest telegram  (No.  .17)  advises the Secretary of State that the matter is most important and that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take any possible step to assist Macao  in the matter.The 3-governor of Macao is understood to have reported to Lisbon that Japanese and British interests are-negotiating;    he has so far ^ it is saidj refrained from transmitting to his Home Government the details of the Japanese offers but he will have to do so in the very near future and will have to recommend acceptance of its unless a British offer matures shortly-The War Office have told the Foreign Office that they...view with some anxiety the establishment of Japanese owned harbour works and possibly aerodromes in such close proximity to Kong Kong, which would have a prejudicial effect on the defence of that fortress.      The Admiralty and Air Ministry have recorded their agreement with this view.(Signed)    G.L&apos;. GENT.Colonial Office, I2th March, 1955.
