THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP 81 (35).CABINET.NATIONALITY OF MARRIED WOMEN.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.1. ON the 19th March, with the concurrence of the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs received a deputation from the Women&apos;s Consultative Committee on Nationality on the subject of the nationality of married women. In accordance with the promise given to the deputation, a verbatim report of the proceedings is circulated herewith for the information of the Cabinet.2. The representations made by the deputation amounted to a request that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should bring pressure to bear on His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions with a view to securing that the nationality law of the Empire should be revised and based on the principle of complete equality of the sexes.3. The subject of nationality is a complicated one, and, if the Cabinet desire to give it further consideration at the present time, we should be glad to have an opportunity of submitting a fuller statement of our views. In our opinion, however, it is sufficient in existing circumstances to state that the subject was fully discussed by the Imperial Conference of 1930, when agreement was reached on certain minor modifications of the principle that a married woman&apos;s nationality should follow that of her husband, but it was clear that there was no possibility of agreement on the principle, of sex equality. We are satisfied that there is no greater prospect now than there was in 1930 of securing agreement among the Dominions on any further changes, and we do not think any useful purpose would be served by bringing the matter again before the Dominions in any form.4. It is, of course, impossible to attempt to bring any kind of pressure to bear on the Dominion Governments, and it appears to us that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom were even to bring to the notice of the Dominions, in however non-committal a manner, the representations of the Women&apos;s Organisations, not only would there be a risk of our attitude being misunderstood by the Dominions, but it would give to people in this country the impression that we have ourselves accepted the principle for which they contend, and would strengthen the demand for legislation. The subject is, as a matter of fact, one which the-National Government have not had occasion to consider, and we do not think any useful purpose would be served by considering it in present circumstances. &quot;:;5. For these reasons we do not propose to take any further action in the matter.[11461]
6. It ought, perhaps, to be mentioned that, as indicated in paragraph 8 (ii) of CP. 39 (35), a statement was recently made in the Commonwealth Parliament to the effect that Mr. Lyons proposed to discuss the question of the nationality of married women when in London this year. Apart from this, it is also possible that the Prime Minister of New Zealand may wish to raise the matter. &apos; It would be impossible for us to prevent a Dominion representative raising the question, but we do not think that any action should be taken on behalf of the;,United Kingdom to bring up the subject for discussion at the meetings.J. G. J. H. .T.April 1935.
APPENDIX.Note of a Deputation to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs from various Women&apos;s Organisations on the subject of the Nationality of Married Women.Mr. THOMAS : As you know, this is really a matter for the Home Office, but as you pressed to see me, because I assume you wanted rather to present the Dominions aspect of the question, I have consented to see the Deputation.Miss DOROTHY EVANS : Yes, it is the Dominions side that we wish to put. Important new factors have arisen in the situation with regard to this question of the nationality of women, and particularly within the British Commonwealth, and we wish to put before you considerations which we hope and believe will influence the Government in deciding upon a policy to be put forward at the sixteenth Assembly of the League of Nations.As you no doubt know, this question of nationality has, at the request of fifteen nations, been put upon the Agenda of the sixteenth Assembly, together with the question of the entire status of women, and with particular reference to two Treaties signed by the seventh Conference of American States at Montevideo in December 1933.It is the Equal Nationality Treaty that we wish to support at this Deputation. The first clause of that Treaty states that there shall be no discrimination based on sex in law and practice relating to nationality. That Treaty was agreed to by twenty-one Republics and it has been ratified by the United States, by Chile, and by Mexico, and has come into force as between those three ratifying States in accordance with Article 3.Article 5 provides for the adherence of the rest of the States of the World, and we are extremely anxious to see this Treaty signed by all the States of the world.The same Treaty was presented at The Hague Codification Conference in 1930 by Chile, and in the discussions the representatives of Great Britain and of several of the Dominions spoke forcibly in favour of the principle of equality of the sexes in this matter. Nevertheless, Britain and several of the Dominions signed The Hague Nationality Convention, which contained discriminations based on sex, and in the teeth of the strong opposition of the Women&apos;s Organisations.Mr. THOMAS ; The Dominions were not unanimous, were they, there ?Miss DOROTHY EVANS : They were not unanimous; they were not all there, as you know, but a good many of them. I am going to try and bring forward the views of those that have expressed views on this subject in a minute.The question of nationality was on the Agenda of the Imperial Conference of 1930, but we have been able to get no information except the printed report about what occurred in the Committee that dealt with this question. The printed report, as you know, says &quot; Careful consideration was given to the subject of the nationality of married women. All members of the Commonwealth represented at The Hague Conference of 1930 signed the Nationality Convention there concluded, and will, it is assumed, introduce such legislation as may be necessary to give effect to Articles 8 to 11 of that Convention. The Conference was satisfied, however, that any proposals for the further modification of the principle of the existing law would fail to secure unanimous agreement. It followed that the Conference was unable to make any recommendation for the substantive amend-ment of the law on this subject except to the extent stated above.&quot; Naturally, organised women desired to know the reason for this failure to agree. We asked what concrete proposal was put forward by the British Government or any other Government as a basis of discussion, but we still lack an answer to that question.We were informed during the official interviews that several of the Dominions were opposed to altering the present system whereby a wife&apos;s nationality is regarded as following that of her husband, and Ireland and South Africa were stated to be emphatically opposed to altering the system.[11461] b 2
&apos;* As regards Ireland; we have seen recently a government measure which goes&quot; much further towards giving equality of the sexes in -&quot;---thisi matter than in-any-other part of the British Commonwealth.   In Irish law the nationality of an Irish woman is placed on exactly the same footing, as the nationality of an Irish man.Mr. THOMAS : You may take it that the Irish decision gives effect entirely to the principle of equality as between the sexes.  You may take that as being so.Miss DOROTHY EVANS: It does so practically, but there is just one small point, and that is transmission.Mr. THOMAS : That is their business.Miss DOROTHY EVANS : Yes.Mr. THOMAS: I am sure you would not expect me to write to Mr. De Valera about that.Miss DOROTHY EVANS : No, I do not think you could, but at the Imperial Conference the opinion of Ireland will presumably take some position -or am I wrong in thinking that?Mr. THOMAS : So far as I know, the Irish Free State up to now have intimated that they do not propose to send anyone.Miss DOROTHY EVANS : I am sOrry to hear that because they are better for us than the others.Mr. THOMAS : You are no more sorry than I am.Mis;s DOROTHY EVANS : I know. There is legislation in progress in New Zealand whereby.the New Zealand Government designs to give a woman the right to retain her own nationality on marriage with an alien, and New Zealand was one of the. countries which particularly asked the President of the Fifteenth Assembly to bring forward the Montevideo Equal Nationality Treaty for discussion!. We know that the British Government desires that a common policy and a common uniform law shall operate with regard to nationality throughout the British Commonwealth, and therefore we have come to you to ask you to be good enough to take steps to try and bring that about along the lines we desire. We want you to prepare the way by making proposals to the Dominions, because we have not been able to get either from your Office or from the Aliens Department any indication that the British Government ha,s definitely made a proposal to the Dominions, or that their statement that it is impossible to get agreement is based really upon definite knowledge of how far the various Dominions would go. If you had information of that sort to give us we should very much appreciate it, because we have not been able to get it.Mr. THOMAS : Let me say here that we have to be very careful not to be confused. You know that under the Statute of Westminster each Dominion has absolute autonomy, so that any attempt to interfere would not only not be diplomatic, but would be very much resented. I am not talking of Colonies now, but about the Dominions. We have to be very careful about showing any tendency towards interference, as it were, and the statement made on behalf of the British Government, that we desire uniformity, was a sincere statement as applicable to-day as when it was made, for this very reason that whatever you may say about foreign countries the proportion of British citizens all over the Dominions is overwhelming as compared with foreign countries, and obviously the One thing you desire for the women of this country is the best opportunity and the greatest freedom, and no discrimination within the British Common-wealth, where they preponderate. That is the real and obvious meaning when we say we desire uniformity. Take it not from the standpoint of a rich woman, but from the standpoint of the wife of the ordinary labourer, poor people who migrate to different parts of the Empire; we want rights as much for them as for the rich, and more especially when they go to our Dominions. That is the real&apos; &quot;meaning of that, and I am sure you would agree with that in principle.Miss-DOROTHY EVANS: Yes, we desire uniformity,, too, but we would rather, of course, have a dissimilarity and.have some freedom for women in some
parts dfwthe Gommonwealths than have no freedom fpr women,.in,any,part of the Commonwealth, ^but^-we-. desire .u^iforiftityj. too,;..- - . ,May I venture to take up that point which you raised, that to dictate or even; to suggest a change in policy to the Dominions might seem to question their right to have their own nationality laws?.    Mr. THOMAS : I did not say that it was not possible to make suggestions.Miss DOROTHY EVANS : No. - &apos; :    &apos; -Mr. THOMAS : People are perfectly free to suggest anything.Miss DOROTHY EVANS : We should like you to make suggestions because the present system was adopted by some of the Dominions, who thereby altered their customs at the suggestion of the British Government in 1914. The. Aliens Act, 1914, was a result of agreement between the Dominions, some of them taking away the rights of their women in answer to a request from the British Government.Mr. THOMAS : Yes, but do not forget that in 1914 there was no Statute of Westminster, and that the definition of the British Commonwealth is entirely different to-day from what it was in 1914.Miss DOROTHY EVANS : Yes. As I said, we should like to see suggestions made, and as a matter of fact suggestions will be made by some of the Dominions, and we should like to see some emanate from our Government, the British Gqvern-ment, at the Imperial Conference, or sooner than that, because of the necessity of having some policy for Geneva in September next. .Will you bear with me if I put one or two arguments which I would beg you to take into consideration in thinking what the British Government will propose, or will support, in September ? Now that twenty-one Governments have accepted the Equal Nationality Treaty, and as we know that several European Governments and Asiatic- Governments are likely to follow suit, there seems to be no likelihood at all of uniformity throughout the world coming about on the limited lines of -The Hague Nationality Convention. All the trend of modern legislation exhibits the tendency to give to women some measure of control over their own nationality, and therefore uniformity throughout the world, which we all desire, because:it is the conflicts of laws which cause this statelessness of women owing to marriage, which The Hague Nationality Convention was designed to remove, could be expected, to come about more along these modern lines of giving the women the same nationality rights as the men. If the Montevideo Nationality Treaty were accepted throughout the world, statelessness of women as a result of their marriage could not possibly occur, but if The Hague Nationality Convention were accepted throughout the whole world which it never will be, but should it be-still there would be cases of statelessness of women resulting from their marriage. It is not acceptable and has been very widely condemned not only by the women  unanimously by the women -but by Governments and, as you know, The Hague Nationality Convention was against our wishes, but at The Hague Codification Conference a recommendation was passed nem. con. asking States to study further whether they could not introduce into their law the principle of the equality of the sexes, and that recommendation has been stressed by succeeding Assemblies. They asked the Governments who had not yet taken legislative steps to give&quot; effect to the principle, to frame their legislation more in accordance, with the women&apos;s wishes, and we have asked the British Government to do that. , When the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act was put forward by the British Government, we asked them to widen it in accordance with the request of the Assembly of the League of Nations. The spokesman of the Government in both Houses assured&apos; us that that measure would net constitute a barrier, to a wider measure along the lines we desire, namely, the Nationality of Married Women Bill which Captain Cazalet has been responsible for on one occasion and which has the support of 40 British women&apos;s organisations and is along the. lines ,of, the unanimous wishes of all the International Organisations, they all ask. for this independent control of a woman over her own nationality. . The, Lord Chancellor, explaining to us why the Government would not widen that British Nationality and Status of Aliens Amendment Bill, asserted that there was still a difference of opinion amongst the Dominions; and, Mr. Thomas/women really ^protest against being kept back for a minority when the majority would; be
prepared to go forward. We do ask that the British Government will; sound the Dominions Governments on this subject, and will see whether a majority would not be prepared to give equality of the sexes in this matter. Some step will have to be taken, we presume, because there is no longer uniformity through-out the British Commonwealth of Nations, and uniformity could be brought about. We cannot find that any Government, except perhaps that of South Africa, is still standing out about this matter, and South Africa has not given an official pronouncement on the matter that we have been able to hear about, so that we should like the position of South Africa definitely defined on this subject, and that could be done in answer to a circular from the British Government.May I be allowed to read the requests which I sent in to you, and which are at the end of our memorandum : -Bequest 1.Therefore, we British feminists, associated with the women of the Dominions and of the other nations in our international organisations, ask the British Government to take immediate steps through the Dominions Office to make the definite proposal to each of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations that the &apos;&apos; common status &apos;&apos; of British nationality as it affects British women shall be put upon the same basis as that of British men, and invite from the Dominions Governments agreement or obser-vations with a view to preparing the policy to be adopted at the 16th Assembly of the League of Nations.Request 2.We ask the British Government to draw attention,to the interest which the nations are showing in the Montevideo Equal Nationality Treaty and to announce the fact that the British Government would be prepared to become an adhering State to that treaty and to ask the British Dominions to do likewise.Request 3.,&apos;We ask that the British Government should also point out to the Governments of the Dominions that a recognition of the equality of the sexes in nationality legislation would put the law into conformity with the requirements of The Hague Nationality Convention, and would fulfil the obligation assumed in 1930. Moreover, the acceptance of the Equal Nation-ality Treaty by all the nations of the world would do away with the conflicts of law which The Hague Nationality Convention was designed to resolve and would render its ratification unnecessary.Mr. THOMAS : Let me first thank you, Miss Evans, for the very able way in which you have presented the case. As it happens, you. are talking to one who, in days when it was less popular to do so than now, took a pretty strong stand on what I then called the emancipation- the real emancipation of women. I was privileged to sit in the House of Commons, and listened to what was being said, that you ought to keep in your homes, that disaster would follow your being given the Vote, and I remember saying in one debate that whatever else might follow your admission to equality, at least you could not be bigger failures than men had already been. That was my contribution at the time, so that on the broad general principle you know where I stand.On the other hand, you will not be unmindful of the difficulties, and I have already explained to you the constitutional position of the Dominions.A full note is being taken of these proceedings, and I will submit that to my colleagues; I will arrange for the shorthand notes to be circulated to the whole of the Cabinet, so that you may rest assured that the whole of my colleagues will know the representations you have made. I do not think you would expect me to say more than that.CAPTAIN CAZALET : We appreciate very much, indeed, your courtesy and kindness in seeing us to-day. We are certain that our case will have sympathetic consideration. There are some here who took part in those battles of bygone years, who appreciated your attitude then and appreciate your attitude to-day, and we are confident that our case, so ably stated by Miss Evans, will have the very careful consideration of yourself and your colleagues.
Mr. THOMAS : Thank you.(The Deputation withdrew after it had been mutually agreed that the following communique&quot; should be issued to the Press :- &apos;&apos; At the Dominions Office to-day the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs received a Deputation of women, introduced by Captain Cazalet, M.P., and headed by Miss Dorothy Evans, representing various British women&apos;s organisations on questions connected with the nationality laws of the different parts of the British Commonwealth. Mr. Thomas took note of the representations made and promised to bring them to the notice of his colleagues.&quot;)o
