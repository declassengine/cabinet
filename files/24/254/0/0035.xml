Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 79 (35).CABINET.STRESA.THE annexed memorandum is a &quot; brief &apos;&apos; for Stresa. The main points for decision at Monday&apos;s Cabinet are in Part III of the Memorandum, more particularly : (1) Eastern Pact what is to be our attitude to this, having regard to german objections? (paragraphs 18 and 19). (2) Austria the same question (paragraph 21).(3) Locarno what should be our answer to the French request to be more definite about our intentions under the Locarno Treaty ? (para-graph 17).(4) The Air Pact can we press for it by itself ? (paragraphs 12 and 13). (5) Armaments of Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria (paragraph 22).At a preliminary discussion between the Prime Minister and some of his colleagues who were available to-day, the line suggested to be taken about the Eastern Pact was developed somewhat as follows :  We should begin by asking for full examination of the proposal made by Germany (Annex I on page 9), urging that though it does not go as far as some others desire, it none the less goes some way and should not be rejected out of hand. This may be expected to bring up the difficulty that Hitler has indicated that he objected to such a pact of non-aggression and consultation being supple-mented by agreements between certain of the signatories to furnish mutual assistance if the Pact was disregarded. We should indicate that we did not consider that Germany had any right to take such an objection merely because she was not prepared to go further herself. It would be far better to agree to the German proposal as far as it went, while indicating that some States would wish to make agreements amongst themselves for mutual assistance. If Germany then took up the attitude that in such circumstances she was not prepared to offer to join in any Eastern Pact at all, that would show where the blame for the breakdown really lay. On the other hand, if at Stresa the German formula is merely rejected as worthless, Germany will certainly exploit the position by saying that she made an offer which was rejected. In presenting this line of argument, we ought to lay stress on our own public opinion and insist that we can only approve of a course which would satisfy our public opinion that everything was being done by the Powers to bring Germany into the agreement and to meet any reasonable objections.We should also sound the others at Stresa on any other alternative to the original conception of the Eastern Pact. A variant which has been suggested is as follow^ : Germany professes to be very much afraid of Russia and Russia to be very much afraid of Germany. But there is a large belt of country which lies between them Czechoslovakia, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia. If Germany undertook to respect her Eastern frontier and Russia to respect her Western frontier, and if these undertakings were duly observed, the intermediate belt would not be disturbed on either side. If in addition to these guarantees 7888   [11415a]
(which, are largely represented by non-aggression pacts already entered into by Germany or Russia), there were added a promise by Germany to come to the assistance of an intermediate country if attacked by Russia, and a promise by Russia to do the same if the intermediate country is attacked by Germany, then this would be a real contribution to equal security. And it avoids what is now Germany&apos;s main objection, viz., that she will not consent to agree to fight side by side with Russia. There are probable objections which would be raised by various parties to this scheme, but it none the less might be worth putting forward as another effort on our part to finding a plan in which Germany would be included.J.

Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1935.SECRET , CoPy N(KCP. 79 (35).CABINET.MEMORANDUM  ON  QUESTIONS  FOR   DISCUSSION   AT   STRESACONFERENCE.[This memorandum has been prepared in the Foreign Office before the Lord Privy - Seal&apos;s return.]I. Introductory.1. BEFORE considering the questions which will arise at Stresa, it will be useful to note the origin of the Conference.The London Communique of the 3rd February outlined the heads of a General Settlement to be &quot; freely negotiated between Germany and the other Powers.&quot; The German Government agreed to discuss all these heads of a settlement; and with the approval of the French and Italian Governments it was decided on the 21st February that, as a first step, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Lord Privy Seal should visit Berlin for purposes of exploration. Then on the 16th March intervened the German decree respecting the reintroduction of conscription and the establishment of an armed strength of 36 divisions. His Majesty&apos;s Government protested to the German Government against this decree on the 18th March a protest which was followed by French and Italian protests on the 21st March. But it was decided that the Berlin visit should still &quot; take place with the scope and for the purposes previously agreed.&quot; Finally, on the 23rd March, the Lord Privy Seal visited Paris; and the following decision was taken at his meeting there with M. Laval and Signor Suvich :-&quot;It was decided that after the Berlin visit and the other British visits to Moscow, Warsaw and Prague, all of which are undertaken with the good wishes^of the other two Governments, the British, French and Italian Foreign Ministers would meet at Stresa on the llth April.&quot;II. Review of Berlin, Moscow, Warsaw and Prague Visits.2. The first business at Stresa will presumably be a review by the British representatives of the Berlin, Moscow, Warsaw and Prague visits. In this review the five questions included in the proposed General Settlement could be dealt with in the order followed at Berlin.3. Eastern Pact. The German document communicated to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the 26th March (Annex 1) could be handed to the^ French and Italian representatives, who could also be told that :- (a) Herr Hitler refuses to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Lithuaniauntil she respects her obligations in regard to Memel;(b) Germany refuses to undertake obligations of mutual assistance in eastern Europe; and(c) Germany would object to an Eastern Pact to which she was a party beingcoupled with mutual assistance obligations between other signatories.. 7888   [11415] &apos; b
4. The following information obtained on this matter in Moscow and Warsaw could also be communicated :  In Moscow M. Litvinoff said that he regarded mutual assistance as a deterrent. If Germany knew that she would find ranged against her a coalition of a number of States, she might hesitate to risk her fate. M. Litvinoff asked what would be the attitude of the British Government supposing the German Government were to continue to refuse to take part in any security pact; but Mr. Eden said that he must refer this matter to His Majesty&apos;s Government.In Warsaw M. Beck explained to Mr. Eden that Poland was not opposed to mutual assistance as such, as her policy was based upon good relations with her two great neighbours, and she would not therefore enter into any arrangement which was liable to endanger those relations with either. In reply to a question from Mr. Eden as to what would be his attitude if a multilateral pact of non-aggression were agreed to in Eastern Europe, and if some of the parties to this multilateral pact were to enter into arrangements between themselves for mutual assistance, M. Beck replied that he did not think he would have any serious objection on principle to such a procedure, provided that Poland&apos;s obligations towards her neighbours and the League of Nations were not thereby infringed. M. Litvinoff informed Mr. Eden that M. Beck had recently said at Geneva that his only objection was that he could not enter the pact unless Germany did so.5. Austria. The French and Italian representatives could be given the general sense of Herr Hitler&apos;s observations, viz., that : (a) He is willing to conclude a bilateral pact of non-aggression with Austria;(6) He does not, so far as Germany is concerned, see the necessity of a non-intervention agreement; Germany is not interested in Austria; but other Powers appear to be interested; if they want a non-interven-tion agreement it is for them to submit to the German Government a more precise proposal than that so far outlined by France and Italy.6. Germany&apos;s return to the League of Nations.-The French and Italian representatives could be told that Herr Hitler indicated that the separation of the Covenant from the Treaty of Versailles would have a certain technical importance in facilitating the return of Germany to the League; but that the real obstacle was the &apos;&apos; inferiority &apos;&apos; of Germany; and that for this to be remedied some attribution of colonial possessions to Germany would be necessary. He referred to his speech of May 1933, in which he said : &quot; We could not remain in the League as a permanently stigmatised people.&quot; Herr Hitler indicated that the position for Germany would be impossible if Japan, who was not a member of the League, had former German colonies while Germany, having returned to the League, had no colonies : Herr Hitler mentioned also the ex-German colonies held under mandate by France and Great Britain,7. Armaments. The French and Italian Governments could be informed that:  At sea Germany claims 35 per cent, of the British fleet, but parity with France.(N.B. It should be pointed out that these two claims are inconsistent. There is a divergence between them of 272,000 tons; 35 per cent, of the British fleet amounting to 395,000 tons; and the French tonnage amounting to 667,000 tons.)It has been agreed with the German Government that an informal exchange of views shall take place in London between British and German Government representatives in order to prepare for a Naval Conference, which should aim at arriving, if possible, at a new naval agreement in the future. It was pointed out to the German Government that this exchange of views must take place under full reservation of the fact that German naval armaments are at present regulated by the Treaty of Versailles.(N.Bj It should be explained that if the figures which would result from the ratios at present contemplated by the Germans are maintained, any measure of agreement will almost certainly be impossible;   the figure which we had
contemplated for the German fleet was some 178,000 tons in place of the 108,000 laid down by the Treaty.)On land Hew Hitler has explained that the 36 divisions will be equivalent to a strength of 550,000 men, recruited on a basis of one year&apos;s service (with the exception of police and technical troops, who will serve for longer periods); that the S.S. and Police will be included in this strength; Herr Hitler refused to recognise that there were any para-military organisations in Germany, or that the Labour Service must be taken into consideration; Herr Hitler claimed that this strength was roughly equivalent to the strength of the French military forces in metropolitan France and North Africa, which he estimated at 500,000 men; he would accept international control and limitation of war material if other Powers did the same; the tables of military strengths^) given by Herr Hitler might also be communicated.In the air Germany claimed parity with the French first-line strength in metropolitan France and North Africa; and was anxious that that should also be the first-line United Kingdom strength; further, Herr Hitler has stated that Germany has already attained parity with Great Britain in the. air. It might be useful also to give the tables of air strengths^1) communicated by Herr Hitler.8. Air Pact. -The French and Italian representatives could be informed that Herr Hitler favoured the early conclusion of an Air Pact between the Locarno Powers and that he deprecated making the conclusion of that Pact dependent upon the negotiation of a General Settlement.III. Discussions at Stresa as regards the Future.9. When this general review of the Berlin, Warsaw, Moscow and Prague visits has been given, it is recommended that the British representatives should leave the French and Italian representatives to make their observations. At any rate, until the French and Italian views are known, it would scarcely be possible for us to make any further statement on the Eastern Pact or as regards Austria. (But see below : paragraphs 18 and 19, and 21.)10. As regards the return of Germany to the League, the French view is set out in the French memorandum of the 23rd March (Annex 2) : &quot;It would be disastrous if a sudden return of Germany to Geneva were contemplated, and if it were considered that her return would settle all questions.&quot;There certainly seems little prospect of Germany&apos;s early return. As well as France, Italy and Russia also would certainly say that if Germany returns to the League at the present moment after having broken, with impunity, her treaty obligations, that would only be a proof that the League, which exists for the defence of treaties, is a complete unreality. The return of Germany to the League in such conditions would only weaken the League.11. As regards armaments, it will be well first to hear what the French and Italian representatives have to say; but there are certain points which we must bear in mind :  (1) Whilst we have agreed to have a preliminary and unofficial conversation with the Germans on naval strengths, we must remember that at sea the Germans have not yet repudiated their treaty obligations as they have in the case of land and air. We must find out if the French consider that there are elements of a settlement as regards military effectives on the basis of the German claim to a peace-strength of 550,000 men, including S.S. police troops and Landwehr; whilst denying, that there are any para-military formations or that the(*) These tables have been checked by the War Office and Air Ministry, and their comments appear as Annexes 3 and 4.[11415] b 2
Labour Service should be taken into account, and claiming that that is equality with the French forces in France and North Africa on the ground that North Africa should be off-set against East Prussia.(2) Ff err Hitler did say that he was prepared to agree to limitation of certain categories of weapons and to supervision, if other Powers would also agree; it might, therefore, be well to ascertain definitely the French and Italian views on these points, whatever their view on the question of effectives. (N.B. The indications of the French view contained in the memorandum of the 23rd March (Annex 2) are not encouraging.)(3) As regards negotiations for the limitation of air armaments, the conditions are somewhat different from those affecting land armaments and are dealt with in connection with the air pact (see paragraph 13).(4) In the matter of armaments it must also be remembered that the French Government have already, in their protest to Germany against the decree of the 16th March, announced their intention to refer the matter of Germany&apos;s military rearmament to the League of Nations; and the French will ask our views on this point when the armaments question is discussed. In their memorandum of the 23rd March (Annex II), the French observed that &quot;it is inadmissible that a Treaty should be broken in such extraordinary circumstances without the breach being followed by some pronouncement from the League, whose whole policy is directed towards ensuring peace by the establishment between States of contractual relations. If the League of Nations did not affirm anew and more solemnly than it has yet done the principle of the sovereignty of treaties, its very existence would soon be in jeopardy.&quot; In this memorandum the French added that they were considering a written communication to the Council, but that they would welcome the observations of the British and Italian Governments. It would seem impossible for us to oppose the French on this point. It might be wiser . to endeavour to agree at Stresa on the exact terms of the resolution on this matter which would eventually be proposed at Geneva. This course of action would probably secure a less provocative resolution than if the drafting was left to Geneva, where M. Benes, M. Titulesco, &amp;c, would be pressing for something violent in order to impress Hungary.12. As regards the Air Pact, we have hitherto taken the line, in Cabinet and in the C.I.D., that we only propose such a pact as part of a general agree-ment covering the matters dealt with in the London communique. Since it is clear that Germany will not agree to join in an Eastern Pact of mutual assistance, it follows that if this is an essential part of the general settlement contemplated, no air pact can be concluded. Germany, it is true, expresses a strong desire to negotiate and agree to the air pact, presumably without any agreed limitation of respective air forces. There are good reasons for thinking that France and Italy would be opposed to the separate and prior agreement on an air pact France, for example, would probably feel that it was impossible to agree to this, which is a purely Western arrangement, while her friends and allies in the East of Europe got no agreement in which Germany shared. Italy would probably make a similar objection on the ground that the Austrian question remained unprovided for. It may therefore be only an academic exercise to consider whether this country would like the air pact to be carried through in the absence of other collateral agreements with Germany. It would be something done; it is a proposal which has been warmly welcomed by public opinion; it provides a specific promise by France of help to this country. But to secure it as an isolated conclusion would be contrary to previous Government intentions, and, in any case, seems an unattainable object.13. There is a conceivable middle course, which would be to negotiate the terms of such a pact up to the point of a draft, but not to put the agreement into operation until other results are secured. This was, indeed, at one time a suggestion of the French Foreign Office, which no doubt thought that by this means an Anglo-French understanding might be reached as to how we would
behave in support of one another in the event of German air attack on either of us. With this in mind, it seems possible that the ground might be explored at Stresa to find out whether the French still take this view and whether inter-changes between the Locarno Powers with a view to formulating the scheme more precisely are possible and desirable. But it may be anticipated that, in any event, the obstacle will be the absence of agreement limiting the size of the respective air forces. And Germany will probably go on saying that Russia&apos;s development in the air is more and more serious, so that no limiting figure for Germany can be finally agreed. On the other hand, it must not be forgotten that Mr. Baldwin in a House of Commons debate on the 8th March, 1934, declared that, if all other efforts at the agreed limitation of armaments failed, we were determined the next morning to &quot; start work to get an air convention alone among the countries of Western Europe.&quot;14. We have had warning that at Stresa, M. Laval will ask us and Italy to consider in advance the situation that would arise in the event of a violation of the demilitarised zone by Germany. M. Laval told Mr. Eden on the 23rd March that : &quot;If the idea should get abroad that Great Britain and Italy would be indifferent in the event of a violation of the demilita-rised zone, it would not be long before a violation took place. The Germans would find some pretext or other .... for committing some new act of unilateral violation.&quot; We must, therefore, have some clear ideas on this subject before we go to Stresa; and we must know how we are going to deal with the questions which the French will ask us about it.15. Stated in the simplest terms, our obligations under Locarno in respect of the demilitarised zone are as follows : If France alleges that Germany is committing a breach of article 42 or 43 of the Treaty of Versailles (no fortifications to be constructed on the left bank of the Rhine or within 50 kilometres of its right bank, and no armed forces to be assembled in the area) France may bring the question before the Council of the League.As soon as the Council is satisfied that such breach has been committed, the Council will notify Belgium, Italy and the United Kingdom and we have severally agreed that in such case we will &apos;&apos; come immediately to the assistance of &apos;&apos; France. The nature of the assistance is not defined.The decision of the Council that a breach has been committed would require our assent, and therefore we could decline to agree if we considered the facts were not sufficiently proved. But we could not contemplate voting in the negative merely to avoid our clear responsibilities.The above is the ordinary procedure of Locarno, but there is also the case of *&apos; a flagrant breach of Article 42 or 43 &quot; by Germany (&quot; flagrant &quot; is not defined, but presumably means serious and deliberate, as opposed to trifling or accidental). In this case, the use of the machinery of the League of Nations is not a condition preceding action. Providing that the United Kingdom has been able to satisfy itself that, by reason of the assembly of armed forces in the demilitarised zone immediate action is necessary, the United Kingdom undertakes immediately to come to the help of France. There is again no definition of the method. The consideration of the matter by the Council of the League will take place later on, as provided in the first place.All the above propositions equally apply if Belgium is substituted for France as the complaining party.16. M. Laval&apos;s question to us is therefore likely to be an invitation to define more strictly what is the kind of action which we will take (1) if the Council of the League notifies to us its decision that there has been a breach by Germany of Article 42 or 43; and(2) if France alleges a flagrant breach of Article 42 or 43. In the latter case, what is the &apos;&apos; immediate action&apos;&apos; which we would take, and what  are the circumstances  in which we should  regard such  action  as *&apos; necessary &apos;&apos; ?
17. It seems to me that the general line which we should follow at Stresa on this matter is as follows : (1) Any declaration which we make should be made jointly with Italy. Our obligations under Locarno exactly correspond.(2) We should be prepared, with Italy, to make a public declaration that we regard the Locarno Treaty as a binding obligation which we intend to discharge according to its terms.(3) I should prefer not to make a specific declaration about the &quot; demilitarised zone,&quot; though this would be included in the general reference. It would be better to speak of the obligations of the Treaty as a whole instead of picking out one set of obligations to the exclusion of others.(4) We should avoid making any public declaration or giving any private assurance which defines exactly what we would do in a particular hypothetical case. Indeed, we should endeavour to avoid being drawn into any such discussion and should suggest that our firm public statement that we mean the Treaty to be duly observed is much more effective from every point of view than going into hypothetical details. If the French persist, it may be necessary to point out that French public opinion is likely to judge very differently a minor infraction like a small fortification from a major infraction like the mobilisation of large forces in the demilitarised zone. But it is surely most undesirable to be drawn into the discussion of these distinctions.(5) We should remember throughout, and remind the French, that the main purpose of any pronouncement about the sanctity of Locarno at Stresa is to give the Germans notice that, though they may have disregarded Treaty obligations about armaments, they had better be warned against disregarding Locarno.18. A summary of the various proposals made since last summer for an Eastern Pact appears as Annex 5. The latest development is that M. Litvinoff asked Mr. Eden on the 29th March &quot; what would be the attitude of Great Britain supposing the German Government were to continue to refuse to take part in any security pact and the other parties went on alone to conclude such security agreements as they could.&quot; Mr. Eden asked for time to consider the question, though he stated that his own personal impression was that there was not likely to be any objection to such a course as M. Litvinoff had in mind, provided first that the security agreements in question were under the auspices of the League and, secondly, that they were open to accession by other States.19. The line we should take up at Stresa in reply to any French enquiry as to our attitude towards the form of Eastern Pact which France and Russia will now want to negotiate should be as follows : (1) We should recall the part we played last July in modifying the Barthou proposal, and in expressing our approval of that idea.(2) We should express our grave concern that neither Germany nor Poland seems prepared to join in the Pact, and our satisfaction that the Pact would be so drawn as to enable them to join it.(3) We should repeat that it is well understood that the United Kingdom cannot undertake new responsibilities in respect of the Pact.(4) But we should add that as firm supporters of all practical methods for collective security, and as faithful Members of the League of Nations,, we should be prepared to accept the carrying through of such an arrangement in the absence of a more complete agreement, provided that it is entered into through and under the auspices of the Leagtte of Nations.(5) We should call the attention of the French and Italian representatives to the German document (Annex 1) and do justice to what it contains (though it will be regarded as insufficient), remembering that the German Government are presenting this suggestion in their reply to France.
20. One matter to be borne in mind is that we must not express approval of any new engagements on the part of France in such terms as will increase our obligations under Locarno. Locarno already contains provisions which secure that the French treaties with Czechoslovakia and Poland cannot bring upon us obligations under Locarno to come to .the assistance of either France or Germany merely because France goes to the assistance of her ally when attacked, and after an attack by France on Germany, Germany invades France. Something of the same sort will be necessary if France makes new agree-ments with Russia; otherwise we shall be accused of having extended our com contractual commitments under Locarno. This is not, of cottrse, to say that if trouble in Europe arises from German aggression on the East which brings France in, with the result that Germany then invades France, we may not have to take part on the ground of our vital interests. But if we do take part it will be because we judge our vital interests to be gravely affected and not because the Treaty of Locarno requires us to do so.21. As regards Austria, we may expect at Stresa that France and Italy will indicate that they wish actively to promote a pact, or pacts, on the lines already outlined at Rome (Annex 6), and approved in the London communique (Annex 6). The new fact is that Germany, during the Berlin visit, raised objections to joining in such a pact, alleging (1) that it was not necessary as far as Germany was concerned; and (2) that &quot;interference&quot; was so vague a word that its application was next door to impossible.Presumably the parties to the Austrian pact which France and Italy may now urge would be, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Hungary and Austria, with the opportunity for the accession of the other limitrophe State, viz., Germany.The Rome proposal also included provision for the possibility of the accession to the pact of France, Poland, and Roumania.It will be remembered that in the early days of the year we objected to being named as a possible adherent and secured our exclusion from the list.The object of the pact is to record the mutual promise of the signatories not to interfere in one another&apos;s internal affairs and not to foment or favour agitation or propaganda which aims at affecting the territorial or constitutional status quo in the other&apos;s country.The Rome announcement further indicated the intention to negotiate &quot; separate agreements in order to ensure, with the co-operation of the League of Nations, the application of the principle &apos;&apos; of non-interference as above defined.What should be our attitude at Stresa when this Austrian question comes up, as it undoubtedly will 1  It seems to me that our line should be as follows : (1) We should recall our previous declarations on the subject and confirm them, i.e., that we cannot undertake special responsibilities of our own in the matter, but that we do regard the integrity and independence of Austria as an object of British policy and have already so declared.(2) That we continue to favour the pursuit of the Rome objective, as stated in the London communique.(3) We should emphasise our continued desire to see an Austrian arrange-ment in which Germany is a party, but should not discourage an arrangement without her if every effort to get her concurrence fails.(4) We should call attention to the difficulties raised by Germany on the ground of the vagueness of the expression &quot;interference,&quot; and ask whether the authors of the plan have as yet found any more precise words.(5) We should insist that anything that is done must be done under the auspices of the League of Nations and should not be an arrangement made between certain States without reference to Geneva. This last point is really covered by the terms of the Rome communique, but it will be for us to bring it out afresh and make much of it.
Foreign Office, April 4, 1935.(6) IiT these-&apos;&apos;circumstances we should indicate that while we shall continue to do anything that can be done to get Germany included, we never-theless feel that an Austrian pact, worked out in suitable terms and under the auspices of the League of Nations, is a contribution to-collective security which we should approve.22. Rearmament of the Smaller Powers. The Italians have raised this question (Annex 7). We clearly cannot legalize the rearmament of the lesser Powers until we have legalized, that of Germany. In the meantime, we can only hope to be able to persuade thejkfcfcfeef not to proceed to the unilateral repudiation which the Italian Governmeritrear as likely to lead to trouble in Central Europe-As a matter of fact, there is probably a considerable element of bluff in the threats of the Little Entente, while, on the other hand, the Austrian, Bulgarian and Hungarian Governments have let it be understood that they do not intend to follow Germany&apos;s lead.J. S.
ANNEX 1. $Iv9tf v* K*/Voie handed to British Ministers by Baron von Neurath on March 26, 1935,respecting the Eastern Pact.In the opinion of the German Government the Powers interested in East European questions might, following up the fundamental ideas of the Kellogg Pact, conclude a pact on the following basis : 1. The contracting Powers agree not to resort to aggression or to force in any form against one another.2. The contracting Powers agree to conclude among themselves, as far as they have not yet done so, treaties of arbitration and conciliation providing for an obligatory procedure of arbitration in the case of disputes of a legal nature, and for a procedure of conciliation with a view to arriving at an amicable settlement in matters of political conflicts.3. If, nevertheless, one of the contracting Powers believes itself to be threatened with aggression or with the employment of force on the part of another contracting Power, then, on the demand of the Power in question, a conference of. representatives of the Governments of all contracting Powers will immediately be convened, in order to deliberate on the situation and, if necessary, on the steps to be taken for the maintenance of peace.4. If, in spite of the above agreement, hostilities should break out between any two contracting Powers, the other contracting Powers engage not to support the aggressor in any way, neither economically nor financially nor in a military way.5. The pact is to be concluded for a period of ten years, with the possibility of extension for a further period.ANNEX 2.Translation of Extracts from Notes prepared in the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs for Departmental Use and handed to Mr. Eden in Paris by M. Laval on March 23 ivith the Statement that it was not to be regarded as a Diplomatic Document......The dramatic gesture of the 16th March has eclipsed the memory ofthe interview given by General Goring on the creation of a German military air force. This is, nevertheless, a fact as grave as the other; it is evidence, moreover, of the same desire and the same method to create a fait accompli by means of preparations made under the greatest secrecy and when all is ready to pass brutally to open action. The signatories of the treaties have now before them the last opportunity of showing Germany that this method leads nowhere.Hitler&apos;s gesture has not only the effect of revealing the extent of the actual rearmament of the Reich and of making possible an appreciation of the importance Of the danger presented by Germany; but it obliges the Powers to take up their position on the doctrine of the fait accompli and the method of unilateral denunciation-ciation of treaties. If they do not show an absolute degree of firmness, if it is possible for one country or another to free itself from existing obligations at will without having to suffer the consequences of such a gesture, this means the ruin of all the efforts made over a period of years in order to arrive at an organisation of European peace.   The British Government, which neglects no opportunity of[11415] ^ c
extolling the collective system of security, is therefore interested more than any other in an energetic correction of the present situation. ....The German plan is simple : Germany, by her gesture of 16th March, has fixed unilaterally the level of her effectives, and she intends that there should be no discussion on this point; she may, perhaps, be willing to agree to a reduction of the number of divisions she has announced, several of which have not yet been created (for this is a conception which does not correspond to any precise effectives figure). But it does not seem probable that she is disposed to make any concessions on the actual total of effectives.On the other hand, Germany may still have some interest at the present moment in a certain limitation of material. In actual fact, she has not yet had the time to reconstitute her stocks of several categories of heavy war material; she may, therefore, be disposed to suggest that new consideration may be given to the MacDonald Plan, that is to say a limitation of calibre and maximum weight of artillery and fighting vehicles, while all war material over and above these limits should be destroyed.Mr. Eden should be warned against the temptation which might be experienced on the English side of entering into a system of this sort, not only because the French and Italian Governments lay it down in principle that no international negotiation may proceed from the basis of a fait accompli, but also because such negotiation would, in fact, lead to a position of absurdity. Since 1933, the British Government has recognised that it would/be reasonable to ask sacrifices of France in the domain of war material, in which she has still a certain degree of superiority which may make some small contribution towards compen-sating her for the permanent inferiority which the proportion between the respective figures of population of Germany and France must impose upon her.Since October 1933 the situation has only gone from bad to worse, and the margin of superiority on which France can still count has grown materially smaller. Now that it is more than ever reasonable to doubt German intentions, is it reasonable to let the Germans even hope that it would be possible to continue in this way? It is clear that the French Government cannot consider any destruction; but that would not in any case hinder them from contemplating qualitative limitation for future construction on condition, of course, that very strict control was exercised over manufacture.....Return of Germany to the League of Nations.The return of Germany to the League of Nations is an essential part of the programme of the 3rd February, but it is only a part. In particular, it would be disastrous if a sudden return of Germany to Geneva were contemplated, and if it were considered that her return would settle all questions. Any German manoeuvre in this sense which may develop must immediately be discouraged.....It is inadmissible from a political point of view that a country should leave Geneva and slam the doors in doing so, and that subsequently for a year and a half it should indulge in wholesale criticism of the institution which it has just left; that it should act without taking the League into account, and without recognising international law; and that, finally, having torn up the international engagements which it had entered into, it should claim the right to return to Geneva without that return forming the subject of any discussion.Theoretically, Germany, as a member of the League of Nations, can resume her place in it at any moment, but if she does so she must expect to be asked to give an account of her conduct and of the violation of her international engagements.In reality, therefore, the question resolves itself as follows : Is it better that Germany should first of all return to Geneva at the risk of a discussion arising there when she would be put in the dock, and which might lead her to withdraw brusquelVbn&amp;again? Or, on the other hand, is it better that after all questions have been settled and all agreements reached, the return of Germany to the League should lay the seal on a detente in international relations and the organisation of a system of collective security, and be thereafter approved without reserve by all the members of the League? What is in any case impossible is that Germany by a mere gesture should, without granting anything in return,
obtain any advantages in the sphere of armaments.   It is equally impossible^^-contemplate that encouragement should be given to the method of withdrawiS^ from and then returning to the League by the fact that Germany might have obtained benefits from it. .Finally, it is the essence of the Agreement of the 3rd February that a link should be established between the return of Germany and the settlement of the complex of questions apropos of which she left the League.Possible neiv German Demands Demilitarized Zone.Up to the present there has been no lack on the part of Germany of declara-tions tending to affirm that the demilitarized Zone will be respected; but what is the value of these protestations % Is it not possible that there will be one day soon a fait accompli in this sphere ? Besides the situation is modified by the very fact that the police is now incorporated in a military organisation. It is true that the Germans protest that the police in the Rhineland will not be incorporated in the new organisations, but it is impossible to place much faith in the value of such a declaration. The violation of the treaty provisions affecting the left bank of the Rhine would be an extremely grave matter. It is necessary that if such a violation should occur the reply to it should be immediate. It is therefore, from this point of view, most desirable that the Powers should not be taken by surprise by such an event and that they should be clear in advance how they would react in such circumstances.This question should from now on be the object of study by the interested Governments so that it may be discussed during the forthcoming Franco-Anglo-Italian meeting. From now on the point of view of France is that, if the event should occur, it would be impossible to stop at a simple protest, and that the procedure laid by the Treaty of Locarno ought immediately to be resorted to.....French Appeal to Geneva.It is inadmissible that a Treaty should be broken in such extraordinary circumstances without the breach being followed by some pronouncement from the League, whose wmole policy is directed towards ensuring peace by the establishment between States of contractual relations. If the League of Nations did not affirm anew and more solemnly than it has yet done the principle of the sovereignty of treaties, its very existence would soon be in jeopardy.Moreover, it is, unfortunately, impossible to exclude the hypothesis that the situation might develop in a far more serious manner. If the situation should develop in this way, it would be fortunate if the Western Powers could point to a formal declaration of the Council of the League recognising that Germany was in the wrong.Finally, it might be added that, if the French Government reserves the right to address a memorandum to the Council in support of its appeal, it has not yet decided upon the exact content, and will accordingly welcome any suggestions which may be offered by Great Britain or Italy.....[11415]
ANNEX 3.War Office Letter to Foreign Office of April 4, 1935, respecting certain of Herr Hitler&apos;s Statements at Berlin Conversations regarding Land A armaments.Sir, &quot;I am commanded by the Army Council to refer to certain points which arose during the conversations in Berlin on the 25th and 26th March last, and to state that the Council have the following observations to make.2. Details regarding the strengths of the armies of Germany&apos;s neighbours are given in Appendix &quot;A&quot; attached; these do not agree, in the following respects, with the strengths given by Herr Hitler during the conversations in Berlin on the 25th and 26th March last.France.Herr Hitler gave a strength of thirty-four divisions plus ten divisions in North Africa.There are, in fact, only thirty divisions in France, including cavalry divisions, and eight or nine divisions in North Africa, of which only four in Algeria and Tunisia are organised as such.It seems that Herr Hitler arrived at his total of thirty-four divisions in. France by including (i) The troops in the two fortified regions on the frontier; these have, however, been found from reductions in the strength of the existing divisions.(ii) The North African &quot;Groupement&quot; of three native regiments, whichis not organised        division and has no artillery, (iii) The mixed colonial &quot; Groupement,&quot; which consists of two native regiments and two native machine-gun battalions.It is also possible that he included some of the non-divisional units (such as corps cavalry regiments, tank and artillery units) which form the general reserve.As regards strength in effectives, Herr Hitler said that France now has a total of 500,000 in France and North Africa; but, according to the French military budget for 1935, there are at present only 349,962 in France and 123,542 in North Africa, making a total of 473,504.This figure would be increased by about 65,000 to a total of 538,500, if it is decided, as suggested by M. Flandin, to retain with the Colours the conscripts due for discharge this month; otherwise the totalof 500,000 to 550,000 will not be reached until the new law of two years&apos; compulsory service becomes fully effective in April 1937.Italy.Herr Hitler appears to have under-estimated the strength of the Italian Army. He gave the strength as thirty-four divisions,. but there are, in fact, thirty-nine, including one division in Libya.Poland and Russia.He also appears to have under-estimated by one division the strength of the Polish Army, and by one division the strength of the Russian Army.I am, &amp;c.Appendix A to War Office Letter of April 4, 1935.Note on French Army Formations in France and North Africa, vide page 24 of cp. 69 (35).1.   In France; there are (a) Twenty active French infantry divisions. Five French cavalry divisions (one mechanised).   One white colonial division.   Four native colonial divisions
(primarily for reinforcement of overseas garrisons). Making a total of thirty divisions in all.(b) In addition there are-(i) Two fortified regions these are on the German frontier and have their own special garrisons, but the regiments for this purpose have been found at the expense of existing active divisions, reducing several of them to two regiments instead of three, while fifteen other regiments have been reduced to two battalions for the same purpose, (ii) A North African &quot; Groupement&quot; this consists of three native regiments, brought over from N. Africa in 1934. It is not, however, organised as a division and has no divisional artillery.(iii) A mixed colonial &quot; Groupement &quot; this consists of two native regimentsand two native machine-gun battalions, which are army troops.(iv) All other units in France (corps cavalry regiments, tanks, corps and army artillery, &amp;c.) are non-divisional and reckoned as part of the General Reserve.(v) Strength. The base effective figures for 1935 for the army in France are as follows : &apos;Officers           ...          ...          ...          ... 20,502 \Long-service Frenchmen            ...          ... 71,960French conscripts         ...          ....... 208,222 [ 329,460N. Africans long-service and conscripts   ... 36,927Colonials long-service and conscripts      ... 12,351Making a grand total of 349,962.2.   In N. Africa.(i) Algeria one army corps of three &quot; mixed &quot; divisions.Note. A mixed division consists of two brigades of infantry (each of two or three regiments), and one brigade of cavalry (two regiments).(ii) Tunisia equivalent of one mixed division.(iii) Morocco there is no divisional or brigade organisation here, but the infantry and cavalry regiments in the aggregate would suffice for three to four infantry divisions and one cavalry division.Note. Apart from the question of lack of higher organisation, by no means all of these units are fit for immediate active service in Franco.(iv) Strength Officers            ...          ...          ... ... 5,160&quot;Long-service Frenchmen ...          ... ... 18,438French conscripts          ...          ... ... 12,373Foreign Legion ...          ...        .... ... 17,468N. Africans long-service and conscripts ... 58,122Colonials long-service and conscripts ... 1.1,981Making a grand total of 123,542.V 118,3823. Total base effective strength in France, Corsica and N. Africa is therefore 473,504.Note. 1. Irregulars employed locally in Morocco and Algeria are not included in the above total.2, The basic effective figures herein given represent a maximum average of troops with the colours throughout the whole year.4. The increase to two years of the colour service for French conscripts combined with a progressive lowering of the age for incorporation by three months per year for period 1936-39 inclusive, will raise the number of conscripts from 208,000 as at present, to : Two annual classes of, say, 117,500 = 235,000. Three months lowering of age limit, say = 30,000. making 265,000, an increase of 57,000.
Figures for remaining French and colonial personnel will presumably remain much as at present, though the intention of increasing the numbers of long-service French personnel has been -announced.Allowing 10,000 for this, the total number in France and N. Africa would be 540,000.Note on the Italian and Czechoslovak Armies, vide page 24 of CP. 69 (35):1.

As to the German Chancellors statement, that Germany has attained parity in the air with Great Britain, there is obviously considerable doubt as to the basis of British air strength on which he claims that parity has been reached by Germany.3. Herr Hitler may have had in mind (1) the figure of 1,045 first-line air-craft, at which he estimated our strength (page 24 of the Notes). This figure approximates to our actual first-line strength at Home and Abroad, plus non-regular squadrons. Alternatively, (2) Herr Hitler may have been referring to the figure of 690 first-line aircraft given by Sir John Simon during the conversations. It is presumed that this figure was intended to represent the metropolitan first-line strength, but the Council would observe that it includes a portion (110 aircraft) of the Fleet Air Arm and 127 aircraft in auxiliary units. The former are provided for the needs of the Navy and there is no assurance that they would even be in home waters in an emergency, while the 127 aircraft in auxiliary units correspond to &quot;Territorial&quot; and not to regular forces. The present number of first-line aircraft in regular units stationed at Home is 453 aircraft.4. The last possibility (3) is that Herr Hitler was claiming to have reached parity with a figure of 2,100, which, according to his estimate (page 24 of notes), represents British first-line air strength &quot; including reserves.&quot; The basis of this estimate cannot be identified by the Air Ministry, but, so far as the admittedly incomplete information at the disposal of the Department goes, it may be said that the total number of Service type aircraft possessed by Germany in first line, immediate reserve, and in Training Units, is not believed at present to exceed 1,320, though this does not include some 200 civil aircraft of types readily Convertible to Service use. The Council are inclined to conclude that the German Chancellor has either deliberately overstated the present strength of the German Air Force or that he was speaking without knowledge. In this connection the enclosed copy of a recent report to Tlis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlin from the Air Attache is of interest.5. In regard to the strength of the Air Forces of the most important of Germany&apos;s neighbours, as communicated by Herr Hitler, the Council consider that these are also considerably over-estimated. This is particularly so in the -case of the figures of first line plus reserve given for each country. A comparison between these estimates, the figures published in the League of Nations Armaments Year Book, 1934, and the latest information derived from secret sources, is contained in Appendix A.6. The first-line strength of the French Air Force in Metropolitan France ,and North Africa is 1,404.   This figure is composed as follows :  Air Force Units in France        ... ... ...        1,042Autonomous Naval Air Force in France ... ... 28Shore based Naval Air Service in France... ... 84Total1,154
Air Force Units in North Africa ... ... 172Autonomous Naval Air Force in North Africa     ... 27Shore based Naval Air Service in North Africa    ... 51Metropolitan Air Force Grand Total...        1,4047. Careful preparations have been made in Germany to organise her aircraft and aero-engine industry for mass-production methods. Immense efforts have been made to ensure that the industry can change from a peace to a war footing with the minimum delay. These preparations imply that Germany might accept a lower peace-time figure for her air force than would be the case if her aircraft industry was not so highly organised; since by changing from peace to war production without delay, she can make good her initial losses in a much shorter space of time than can countries whose industry is less well organised. In effect, this means that Germany, after the first clash and consequent losses, would be in a stronger position than her opponents during the period in which they were organising their aircraft industry to meet war wastage.8. The Air Council would also refer to the references to air bombing contained on pages 30 and 31 of the Note of the conversations.- They appreciate that Herr Hitler&apos;s references to the desirability of protection of non-combatants from the risk of indiscriminate bombing are in entire accord with the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and they assume that the reference by Secretary Sir John Simon to that matter was intended to endorse Herr Hitler&apos;s views, but not in any way to imply that His Majesty&apos;s Government considered practicable the complete prohibition of air bombardment even against military objectives.T am, &amp;c.Appendix A to Air Ministry Letter of April 5, 1935.Air Ministry Comments on Herr Hitler&apos;s Statement regarding the Strength of\ the Air Forces of the most important of Germany&apos;s Neighbours.France.Herr Hitler.August 1934 : 1st Line Aircraft, 1,986; including reserves, 3,800.

These figures are for 1933.Air Ministry.First Line Strength : 1,663 aircraft; including reserves, approximately 2,500.There is reason to believe that the Armaments Year Book figure of 2,980, which was supplied by the French Government itself, is at present an over-estimate.  The position in regard to reserves is, however, being rapidly improved.Herr Hitler&apos;s statement that the number of French military aircraft, including reserves, increased from 3,800 in August 1934 to 6,000 in April 1935, cannot be accepted, and the latter figure is absurdly high.Italy.Herr Hitler.August 1934 : 1st Line, 1,059 machines; including reserves, 1,600. April 1935 : Including reserves, 2,100 machines.Armaments Year Book, 1934.Total number of aeroplanes of types suitable for use in war is stated as 1,507 on the 30th June, 1931, the latest date for which figures are given.
Air Ministry Comments.- - The first line strength of the Italian Air Force is about 1,080 machines; including reserves, it is believed to be about 1,530. The Air Ministry does not agree that there has been any recent increase in numbers of aircraft in the Italian Air Force. Italy&apos;s present plans for reorganisation of her Air Force are believed to be qualitative rather than quantitative.Czechoslovakia.  -Herr Hitler.August 1934: 1st Line Aircraft, 570; including reserve, 960.

Appendix B to Air Ministry Letter of April 5, 1935. The Ambassador,In an interview with Oberst Wenninger of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium on Saturday, the 30th March, I had an opportunity of inquiring informally^ what Herr Hitler exactly meant when he told Sir John Simon last week that Germany has now got parity with Great Britain: did it refer to our first-line strength or to the figure which was stated as representing our total air strength including reserves (1,847 aircraft)?Oberst Wenninger said he expected he meant our first-line strength; but he \a^Lu/1h^ \ added that all he had heard about it was a remark by the &quot; Fiihrer &quot; in the officers&apos; &quot; mess after the inspection last week of the^Jagd Gruppe at Doberitz.     Herr.jFfiTleFwas saying how Sir John Simon hacj/replied &quot;about the same as yours&quot;; i Wenninger says he then added the remark    &apos; I don&apos;t know how many aeroplanes gZ^d rGbring really has got, but that seemed about what there ought, to be.&quot;I do not pretend to know even now what exactly the statement meant, and I gather that Oberst Wenninger does not either. I &quot;think, however, that it can now be said with fair confidence that Herr Hitler&apos;s remark to Sir John Simon about parity was not an exact or carefully prepared pronouncement, but a more or less loose statement with no very close relationship to actual figures.^5w- J f \F.

Original Franco-Russian Proposal, as modified at the Anglo-French Meeting in London on July 9 and 10, 1934, and subsequently approved by the Russian Government on July 19, 1934.(1) Poland, Russia, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania agree to assist each other immediately in the case of an aggression by one of their number against another; to give no support to an aggressor country not a party to the pact; and to consult with one another and with any interested outside Power in the case of a threat of aggression against any of the signatories.(2) Soviet Russia accepts as towards France and Germany the obligations of a guarantor Power under the Treaty of Locarno; and France accepts as towards Soviet Russia and Germany the commitments under (1) above in cases involving action under Article 16 of the Covenant, or &quot; decisive action taken by the League Assembly or Council &quot; or in fulfilment of paragraph 7 of Article 15 of the Covenant.(3) Signature of a general Act by all the above Powers, including France, to the effect that the arrangements in (1) and (2) above are such as to contribute to the maintenance of peace; are without prejudice to the obligations and rights ofAir Ministry.First-line strength, 180; reserves not known, but not likely to exceed 50 percent.N.B.

the contracting parties as members of the League; and that the entry into force of these arrangements is subject to their ratification and to the entry of Soviet Russia into the League of Nations.II. Franco-Russian Protocol of December 5, 1934. The French and Russian Governments agree (1) Not to engage in negotiations tending towards the conclusion with any of the proposed signatories of the Eastern Pact, of bilateral or multi-lateral agreements which might compromise the realisation of the Pact.(2) To keep each other informed of all such proposals which might be put before them.(3) In the event of a breakdown of the negotiations for the Eastern Pact, to-&quot; consult on the new assurances which, in the same spirit and with the same object, it should seem to them desirable to give one another.&quot;III.-London Communique of February 3, 1935.The British and French Ministers are &quot; agreed that nothing would contri-bute more to the restoration of confidence and the prospect of peace among nations than a general settlement freely negotiated between Germany and the other Powers. This general settlement would make provision for the organisa-tion of security in Europe, particularly by means of the conclusion of pacts, freely negotiated between all the interested parties, and ensuring mutual assistance in. Eastern Europe . . . .&quot;IV. British Suggestions for a modified Eastern Pact (Foreign Office Telegram No. 32 to Paris of February 19, 1935). (Unofficially communicated to-the French Foreign Office.)(1) The existing non-aggression treaties^) between Germany and Russia,. Germany and Poland, Russia and Poland, Russia and Lithuania, to be completed by conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between Germany and Lithuania.(2)(2) Upon the system of. bilateral non-aggression treaties in (l) would be-superimposed a French guarantee of the Russo-German, Russo-Lithuanian, Russo-Polish and German-Lithuanian treaties. (N.B. Poland is already guaranteed by France against Germany under the Franco-Polish Locarno Treaty of 1925); and a Russian guarantee of the German-Lithuanian and the German-Polish treaties (if so desired by Germany and Poland); whilst Russia would also guarantee the main Locarno Treaty in so far as France and Germany are concerned; Germany would guarantee the Russo-Lithuanian and Russo-Polish treaties (if so desired by the parties).V. French Suggestions for a Modified Eastern Pact (Paris Telegram No. 30 of February 21).   (Unofficially made by-the French Foreign Office, but . never endorsed by the French Government.)(1) A reciprocal undertaking of non-aggression and consultation by Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and France and Russia.(2) A provision permitting the above signatories to conclude engagements amongst themselves to meet a breach of the obligations entered into under (1).The advantage urged in favour of this scheme was that it would not oblige Germany or Poland to give guarantees of mutual assistance; but that it would enable France and Russia to conclude a mutual assistance engagement which, would be open to the participation of Germany.(x) (1) German-Russian Treaty of Berlin, 1926.   (Renewed 1931).(2) German-Russian Conciliation Treaty of 1929:    (Ratified 1933).(3) German-Polish Locarno Arbitration Treaty, 1925.(4) German-Polish Declaration, 1934..   (Good for ten years).(5) Polish-Russian Non-Aggression Treaty.   (Good until 1945).(6) Russo-Lithuanian Non-Aggression Treaty.   (Good until 1936). (-) In this scheme Czechoslovakia, Latvia, Esthonia and Finland have been omitted, as. their inclusion does not seem essential to the arrangement.[11415] &quot; e
VI. German Suggestions for an Eastern Pact. (German Note of March 26.)(1) Non-aggression and no force agreement between the contracting Powers.(2) Arbitration and conciliation treaties between the contracting Powers.(3) A conference of the contracting Powers should one of them believe itself to be threatened with aggression or force by another contracting Power.(4) The contracting Powers undertake &quot; not to support the aggressor in any way, neither economically nor financially nor in a military way &apos;&apos; should hostilities break out between two contracting Powers.(5) Conclusion of the Pact for ten years, with the possibility of extension.ANNEX 6. Declarations regarding Austria. I.Declaration of February 17,1934, by the British, French and Italian Governments.The Austrian Government has enquired of the Governments of France, Great Britain and Italy as to their attitude with regard to the dossier which it has prepared with a view to establishing German interference in the internal affairs of Austria and communicated to them.The conversations which have taken place between the three Governments on this subject have shown that they take a common view as to the necessity of maintaining Austria&apos;s independence and integrity in accordance with the relevant treaties.II.Declaration of September 27, 1934, by the British, French and italian governments.After having proceeded to a fresh examination of the Austrian situation, the representatives of France, the United Kingdom, and Italy have agreed in the name of their Governments to recognise that the Declaration of the 17th February regarding the necessity of maintaining the independence and integrity of Austria in accordance with the treaties in force retains its full effect and will continue to inspire their common policy.III.Franco-Italian Protocol of Rome of January 7, 1935, regarding Central europe and, in particular, Austria.The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the French Republic and the Head of the Italian Government have made an exhaustive examination of the situation in Central Europe, and especially in Austria. They have recognised the need of developing sentiments of confidence there, notably by the reaffirmation of the obligation under which every State rests to respect the independence and territorial integrity of other States. Firmly attached for their part to the observation of this principle, they have agreed to recommend to the States most interested, the conclusion, within the framework of the League of Nations, of a convention providing particularly for a reciprocal undertaking not to interfere in their respective internal affairs, as also a reciprocal undertaking neither to foment nor favour any agitation, propaganda or attempt at intervention having as its object an attempt by force on the territorial integrity or the transformation by force of the political or social regime of one of the contracting countries. It would be open to the contracting countries to conclude separate agreements in order to ensure, with the co-operation of the League of Nations, the application of this principle.
IV.Extract from the Anglo-French Communique of February 3, 1935, regarding a ustria.With reference to the Franco-Italian agreements recently reached in Rome, the British Ministers, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, cordially welcomed the declaration by which the French and Italian Governments have asserted their intention to develop the traditional friendship which unites the two nations, and associated His Majesty&apos;s Government with the intention of the French and Italian Governments to collaborate in a spirit of mutual trust in the maintenance of general peace.....   The general settlement would make provision for the organisation of security in Europe, particularly by means of ... . the system foreshadowed in the Rome proces-verbal for Central Europe.ANNEX 7.Note communicated by the Italian Ambassador, April 2, 1935.The following are some suggestions which should be taken into consideration and examined in connection with the Stresa meeting. They have already been submitted to the French Government  (1) Uselessness of proceeding with the conversations with Germany on the bases indicated by Germany in the Berlin conversations.(2) Necessity that Germany should be made to feel the solidarity between the other Powers as well as their strong determination to avoid her embarking on some further adventure which might lead to war.(3) Attitude to be taken towards the German decree of the 16th March. In this connection, have the British Government already formed some definite opinion ?(4) Necessity of solving the question of the smaller States which are also disarmed by Treaty. Whatever Germany might obtain should be granted to them as wrell, but through a convention.(5) Agreement on the direct means to be employed for the protection of Austrian independence and integrity.
