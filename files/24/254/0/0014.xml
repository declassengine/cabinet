1 ll t)Bron-y-de, Churt,Dear Prime Minister, March 14, 1935.HEREWITH, at your request, I send you details of the plans for utilising the depression to reorganise and develop our national resources and to improve national conditions.The Memorandum I enclose represents the views of experts drawn from all parties. As to some of these experts, I have no notion what party if any they belong to. We all strove to make our contribution to the volume of suggestions and counsel which is coming from all quarters to stimulate and erect a national effort to solve the grave social and economic evils from which this country, in common with the rest of the world, is suffering.I assume that the Government, before coming to a final conclusion on these plans, will afford me an opportunity of appearing before the Committee to which they are referred for examination.Ever sincerely, (Signed) D. LLOYD GEORGE.The Right Hon. J. Ramsay MacDonald, M.P., 10, Downing Street, S.W. 1.I:i.i!.5-P
CONFIDENTIALPLANS SUBMITTED BY THE RIGHT HON. D. LLOYD  GEORGE O.M., M.P., FOR UTILISING THE DEPRESSION TO REORGANISE ,, AND DEVELOP OUR NATIONAL RESOURCES AND TO IMPROVE J(It NATIONAL CONDITIONSIntroduction.(a) A Programme Wanted.This is a programme for those citizens of Great Britain who want to see something done, not merely because action will provide work for the workless, but because this period of wide and prolonged slackness and unemployment affords the best opportunity ever ; presented to us as a nation for setting right many things we neglected in periods of prosperity.Things are far from well with us as a people. Ever since the War our foreign trade and shipping business, which played a greater part in our national economy than in that of any other country, have dwindled seriously. During the last five years the fall in this business has been catastrophic. We have great derelict areas in town and country. With factories standing idle and land going to waste, we have a large part of the nation underfed, ill-clad, badly housed and overcrowded.Even before the great trade depression which has lasted with us for over 5 years we had millions dwelling in housing conditions which were a discredit to a wealthy and proud nation, and we had millions more who were living their lives in a state of penury which was below the poverty line of subsistence. Since 1921 there has been an irreducible minimum of 1 million of our workers unemployed. Since the great slump of 1931 the total number of capable workers simultaneously out of a job has been always well above 2 million. The numbers thrown by the depression out of work for long or short periods during the year are 5 million. That means 5 million households whose incomes are prejudicially affected by unemploy-ment. That does not take into account the hundreds of thousands of the black-coated community who suffer without any aid for them-selves and their families from any Insurance Fund. In all, 18 million of men, women and children have had the comforts of life appreciably reduced by this prolonged depression.Everyone would like to see this condition of things bettered. There may be pessimists who think nothing can be done, and preach the resignation of despair. There are certainly too many Micawbers who wait with silly optimism for something to turn up. This programme is not for them, but for the great mass of the nation, which is ready and eager to work out its salvation, if only it can be shown a sensible, practical method of rebuilding our prosperity.(b) Building not Scrapping.The proposals here put forward are not wild or revolutionary in character, but practical suggestions for putting our economic Bystem on a business basis, where it will produce its best for the well-being of all classes of the community. The proposals grow out naturally from constitutional precedent and modern  developments of pur
economic system. This system needs amendment and improvement to adapt it to the needs of this generation. The evils now resulting from it show that. It can be amended without being scrapped. The immense advantages of individual enterprise, energy and initiative which our present economic system fosters are not to be lightly sacrificed. They must rather be controlled and cultivated, so that they may yield an ordered harvest for the nation.The real wealth of a land is the life of its people a life healthy, happy, richly dowered with the necessities and amenities of an ample, interesting and useful existence. We have in Britain vast resources of man-power, finance, industrial materials, -inventive capacity, technical skill. The system by which those are applied to enrich the nation must be brought up to date, so that it can answer the needs, not of yesterday, but of to-day and to-morrow. That is the object of this programme.Chapteb I. The Problem. (a) Unemployment.For the past fourteen years we have had in Great Britain a permanent, irreducible minimum of a million of our industrial workers unemployed.For the past four-and-a-half years. we have had an irreducible minimum of 2 million of our workers unemployed.In our economic system, as it at present operates, there is no symptom to indicate that this figure of 2 million will be appreciably reduced. On the contrary, it looks like being established as the permanent average level of unemployment.This means that we are faced with a situation in which, if it is allowed to continue unchanged, we shall always have 16 per cent., &apos; or, say, one in six, of the available workers in the country standing idle.That is the core of our problem.(b) Causes of Unemployment.(i) Loss of External Trade.During the post-war period Britain has found.it impossible to recover for her exports the world market which she enjoyed before the war.Since the onset of the trade depression, five years ago, world trade has suffered a still further contraction. Those effects have been accentuated by the fall in wholesale prices. Although this country has succeeded in retaining more than its post-war share of the diminished international market, we have suffered seriously from the effects of its contraction. The value of the produce and manufactures of the United Kingdom exported in 1929 was  729-3 million. In 1934 it was  396-1 million. This is a fall of 46 per cent.The rapid growth of industrial development in other countries has enabled many of them not only to make for themselves goods which they formerly bought from us, but to compete with us in the remaining markets of the world. That competition has come to stay. It will probably increase, not diminish, and there is a tendency for countries which still import our manufactures to make more of them for themselves.The international market has been still further crippled by the recent intensified growth of high tariffs and quotas, and of restrictions on exchange transactions and their uncertainties. In the interests, not only of our own export trade, but of general world prosperity, we ought to do all in our power to press forward with negotiations for the limitation and reduction of these hampering restrictions. As matters now stand, even if we made a bold bid to expand our exports by producing cheap and highly saleable articles, there would be an external limit placed upon our possible total sales. The Governments of the purchasing countries might take action to
restrict their importation. And even if we succeeded in selling our wares, we might find it difficult to get payment for them on account of the exchange restrictions in the purchasing countries and of the fact that Britain herself now imposes tariffs and quotas to keep out the imported foreign goods, in which alone payment could be received.. A very serious result of this falling-off in international trade has been the depression in British shipping and the British shipbuilding industry. Before the War, nearly half the world&apos;s merchant shipping was British, and British shipyards were turning out upwards of a million net tons of new shipping a year, of which more than one-fifth was for foreign purchasers. To-day, of the total shipping of the world, only 32 per cent, is British. Shipbuilding has in recent years declined to such an extent that in 1932 and 1933 it was less than 10 per cent, of the 1913 figure, and for by far the greater part of the last four years, more than half the workers in shipbuilding, ship-repairing and marine engineering have been unemployed. The numbers employed in British ships have declined since 1913 by 70,000, or over 27 per cent.The decline of shipping has a very serious adverse influence on general industry and national prosperity. One-third of the popula-tion of the country lives in seaport towns. Shipping construction and repair, and the movement of vessels, affect the coal, iron and steel industries, and the decline of maritime activity reinforces the depressing effect of the reduction in our overseas trade.In past years, something like one-third of the total employment in this country has been dependent, directly or indirectly, upon the production and transportation of goods for overseas trade. But it would be folly to shut our eyes to the fact that without a bold initiative on the part of our Government to improve our trade relations and our trading opportunities, there is very little prospect under existing conditions of expanding our overseas market to an extent which will have any appreciable effect on our unemployment problem.(ii) Labour-Saving Devices.Mechanical power is at once a great expansion of man-power and a substitute for it. Man-power alone could not give us more than a fraction of the material comforts we enjoy to-day. But each new labour-saving device appears at the outset as a displacement of man-power by mechanical power. When there was a wide and growing field in which to market our products the displacement was only temporary, and the demand for human labour was soon larger than before. To-day the keenness of industrial competition makes it more than ever necessary to cut the cost of manufacture by every possible labour-saving device. But as markets are restricted, these devices create temporary unemployment which is less easy to dissipate. The magnitude of this problem can easily be exaggerated, and it would be suicidal to refuse on that score to adopt the most efficient methods. Without them we cannot hope to retain, much less to expand, our overseas markets; and the unemployment caused by their loss would be far worse than that occasioned by the use of these appliances. Further, they are a means of expanding our wealth producing capacity. With their aid, a given sum of human labour can produce an ever-increasing proportion of the goods and amenities that serve human welfare.We must expect, and in fact welcome, a further growth of labour-saving devices. But this means that our present industrial output can be maintained with less labour unless and until consumption is considerably increased by the increase of purchasing capacity here and abroad. Even a growth of output may not necessarily imply a fully corresponding growth of employment.Thus, if we consider the two factors most commonly cited as responsible in large measure for the persistence of the irreducible minimum of 2 million unemployed workers decline of world trade, and growth of mechanical substitutes for human labour we are forced to the conclusion that both of them will continue to present a problem as far ahead as we can reasonably forecast.
. (c) Economic Effects.The basic principle of our present system is that the yearly income ol the nation passes to its citizens as payments earned by them through their labour or through the services rendered by their capital.Obviously, this system can only work if the citizens of the country are given .a fair opportunity to contribute their services and labour to the national production of wealth and thereby earn their share in the distribution of that wealth.To-day this system is not working satisfactorily. At least 16 per cent, of the people able and willing to earn their bread are continuously debarred from doing so. Indeed, as the Minister of Labour recently pointed out in his remarkable analysis of the figures of unemployment, the shadow of unemployment stretches far wider than that figure shows. His statement adds to the gravity of the problem. Of the total number out of work, about one-fifth have been continuously unemployed for a year or more, and of these a steadily increasing number have grown into manhood without ever doing any work at all. The remaining four-fifths are a shifting multitude, most of whom are workless for not more than three months at a time. Thus, while the total number of the workless at any given moment is upwards of 2 millions, the actual number of our workers who live under the menace of frequently recurring spells of unemployment must be at least 5 millions. Out of these 5 millions, over 2 millions are always out of work. And, as will be pointed out later, it is equally true that a great deal of the available capital of the country is industrially idle.We do not allow our workless to starve. We keep them alive with a frugal allowance of unemployment benefit and dole, out of the resources of the nation&apos;s yearly income. But they stand outside the circle of our national economy. However willing and capable they are, they make no contribution to our national wealth and are unable, as wage-earners, to draw their share of the national income in accordance with the normal working method which is the basis of the system.Further, their inability to earn a full normal wage cuts down their capacity as purchasers and consumers of the goods produced. Out of the total of over 10 million working-class households in Great Britain, only about 7 or 8 million can be depended upon as customers for the average purchases required by them. Those who are sporadically unemployed have not means enough to buy anything more than the barest necessities. There is thus a considerable market here at home for the products of industry, which is in abeyance because 2 million (or rather 5 million) unemployed and their households are unable to earn the wherewithal to acquire a normal purchasing capacity. Such dole money as they are allowed is really withdrawn from the pockets of those more fortunate who are still within the economic circle, and reduces the spending power of these to the extent that it increases that of the workless.Here, clearly, is a diseased condition of the national body politic. Viewed in the coldest light as a business issue, it is intolerable that we should resign ourselves to keeping permanently some 16 per cent, of our population outside our economic system and maintaining them there as a lingering dead-weight on our efforts to achieve prosperity.It is needless to stress the social and moral aspect of this problem  the sheer inhumanity of leaving such numbers of our fellow-citizens in hopeless idleness, barred horn the satisfaction and self-respect of doing useful work. It is needless to dwell on the danger of national deterioration which threatens when scores of thousand? of young fellows grow up into manhood without ever knowing the discipline of regular work. The numbers are increasing. It must also be evident, to every thoughtful observer, that there is a growing peril in the irresistible movement to narrow the gap between dole and wage. With prolonged unemployment that tendency is inevitable. Humanitarian impulses rebel against the chronic-privation involved in an allowance which does not permit of the purchase of comforts in millions of homes.    These imponderable
elements of the problem are in truth vastly more vital than those which can be calculated in terms of material economic factors. On reviewing them we are driven even more strongly than by the business considerations involved, to conclude that the permanent burden of our present mass of unemployment is a strain which our system cannot endure, without serious detriment to the well-being of the whole nation.Somehow or other we have got to bring back those millions of wholly or partially unemployed effectively inside our economic system. We have got to put them again into the position of being able, by virtue of the services they render, to earn their due share of the nation&apos;s wealth. If the existing machinery of private enter-prise and finance is unable to achieve this, then that machinery must be improved, and, if need be, supplemented. It is clearly not a question of applying some small palliative here and effecting some slight improvement there. Our plans must be laid on a basis which will enable the normal operations of public and private industry in town and country to employ continuously an additional 2 million workers.   Anything short of this is playing with the problem.Chapter II. Our Resources. (a) Finance.The task, as outlined in the preceding paragraph, is equivalent to that which would confront us if we proposed to set up in this country a great new productive industry which would give work to 2 million employees. The first question which naturally arises is whether there would be capital available for so gigantic a venture.In considering this question we will confine ourselves to two outstanding features of the present situation.In the first place, it must be pointed out that the State is already finding in the form of unemployment benefit, transitional payments and public assistance a considerable sum towards the maintenance of the 2 million workers and their dependents without any equivalent return. To their number must be added the scores of thousands of black-coated workers and other uninsured unemployed, such as farm workers, whose total cannot be precisely determined. The black-coated out-of-works have been estimated at a quarter of a million. We are spending as a community more than  100 million a year for this purpose with the increase resulting from the new regula-tions, fully  110 million and unless something as yet unforeseen is done to change the situation, we are likely to go on indefinitely expending that sum year by year.Since the State can at present raise capital at less than 3 per cent., this means that we are expending the interest charge upon a capital sum of not far short of  3,500 million for a purpose which adds nothing to the national wealth. Indeed, this figure of  110 million per annum, if utilised as an annual payment of interest and sinking fund for a short-term loan on a 3 per cent, basis, would serve to raise and to repay in ten years a capital sum of nearly  l,&apos;000 million. If practical measures can be devised to set to useful and productive tasks these workers now condemned to idleness, the application by the State of its credit, even up to a very high total, would be. a positive economy.In the second place, the restriction of our export market and the contraction in purchasing power of our home population, due to the denial to 2 millions of them of the right to earn their livelihood, have had the result of rendering a large amount of the nation&apos;s capital idle. This is evidenced by the rising total of bank deposits and the pressure of demand on gilt-edged securities. The average amount held in the London Clearing Banks on current, deposit and other accounts, which in 1931 was  1,699 million, was in 1934  1,880 million, and by January 1935 had risen to  1,982 million. Excluding the non-interest-bearing balance, the substantial amount carrying interest yields to its depositors only ^ to l-  per cent, per annum. The pro-portion utilised by the banks to assist industry has been steadily
declining, as is shown by the following figures (though the published figures of 1934 are slightly better than those of 1933): Money used by the Banks to Promote Trade.	Advances to Customers and other Accounts.	Percentage of Deposits.	Discounts.	Percentage of Deposits.1929  ... 1931........ 1934  ...	991,000,000 919,000,000 753,000,000	55-1 52-2 40-0	229,000,000 256,000,000 230,000,000	12-7 14-6 12-2As the average amount which the bankers have been able to use for commercial purposes has dwindled, they have been compelled to seek an investment for it more and more in the gilt-edged market. The course of bank investment has recently been as follows : Average Amount Invested.Percentage of total deposits held.1929   .........      257,000,000 or 14-31931    .........      301,000,000 or 17-11933    .........      537,000,000 or 27-51934   .........      560,000,000 or 29-8The effect of this on the price of gilt-edged and fixed interest securities has been to force up their quotation in the following manner: Average price of gilt-edged securities 1931     ......      ......... 95-81933     ............... 119-71934............... 124-4The evidence of the existence of surplus money unable to find productive investment, which is furnished by the foregoing figures, is confirmed by the statistics of new capital issues. The annual savings of the nation, which can be utilised for financing productive industry, are commonly estimated to be in the neighbourhood of  500 million a year. Of this, a certain amount is put back forthwith into expendi-ture on the renewal and improvement of industrial plant, and some is privately invested in ways that do not affect the public issue market. But in 1928, the last year before the Stock Exchange collapse began in America, the total of new capital issues floated on the London market totalled  370 million. In 1933 the total was down to  245 million, and in 1934 to  170 million. Between 1928 and 1933 the share capital of building societies increased by over  180 million, and some of them are now proving unwilling to accept further capital. Altogether, the figures given establish the fact that on a conservative estimate there are  200 million a year of national savings available in this country for sound and useful investment, which are to-day being largely sterilised for lack of an outlet.It is clear, therefore, that on the financial side there is no shortage of money in the country to supply the necessary capital for such an expansion of our national industries as Would transfigure and ultimately eliminate our unemployment problem. Profitable industry yields not only an increase in the yearly income of the nation, but also in its effective capital, and the wise use of our existing resources would increase them, as well as provide work and wages for the unemployed. But at present, hundreds of millions of the privately owned capital of the nation is being left to its owners in the banks because no safe investment for it is offering, and the banks them-selves can find only a rapidly dwindling use for this money in trade and industry, and are pouring the unwanted surplus in a large measure and at an increasing rate into the gilt-edged market. And, meanwhile, the State itself is expending yearly a sum equivalent to the income on a capital of nearly  3,500 million in order to finance, not industry, but idleness. In these circumstances it is the clear duty of the State to think out what industrial developments are desirable, and under cover of its guarantee, to diwwtf; the capital resources of the nation to such productive uses.
(b) industrial Possibilities.For reasons already given, it is not easy to envisage any early prospect of a large expansion of the export trade of our already established staple industries to the markets of highly-developed countries. There are, however, immense possibilities inside the Empire in undeveloped or partly developed countries like India and our Colonies, and there is unlimited room for the expansion of international trade in the vast territories of Russia and China. The prospects in all these markets depend largely upon the policy we adopt in reference to the development of the resources of the Empire, and in the case of China and Russia, upon the diplomatic and financial foreign policy we pursue.The undeveloped possibilities of China deserve more than passing mention. Here is a country of 500 million people, skilful, persistent, and with a natural industry distinctly above the average; a country rich in natural resources, in minerals and in great agricultural areas of high natural fertility. Properly developed, it could supply goods to the rest of the world, and purchase in return from the rest of the world, on a scale which would mean an immense increase of world trade and of universal wealth and well-being. Yet, at present, owing to lack of equipment, and to the absence of almost every external condition which makes for production in particular, the deplorable deficiency in transport facilities the output of wealth per head of the Chinese worker is less than one-thirtieth that of workers in Canada and the United States.More than anything, China needs a rapid extension of communi-cations, especially railways, without which her Government cannot control her vast area, and put an end to the conditions of unrest, revolt and banditry from which she suffers; and without which a busy and well-organised trade, and the development of her potential wealth, are impossible. For this, she needs financial help from outside, and large supplies of railway^ equipment, rolling-stock, structural steel, machinery, &amp;c. The value of China as a potential market has been clearly recognised by Japan, which is pursuing there a firm and. strong policy of intervention and penetration. On many other grounds than those of commercial advantage only, it would be a disaster if the Western Powers failed to co-operate in the process of helping China to establish herself, and left her alono to the tender mercies of Japanese exploitation. For the future of world peace and world harmony, it is vital that other Powers, and in particular Great Britain, the United States and Russia should agree on a line of policy no less firm and strong than that adopted by Japan, and should join with that country in aiding China to get on her own feet. On the commercial side we should all benefit by wise statesmanship of this order, China most of all.The Indian market, too, could be made far more valuable to Us than it is at present. It is suffering bitterly from the fall of world prices and from the effects of British monetary policy, which have reduced to a very low level the purchasing power of the Indian peasant. In 1924, the average Indian family, after meeting its living costs and paying its taxes, had left about  3 per annum for personal savings, debt payments, and spending on manufactures. To-day, on the same basis of calculation, that margin is a minus quantity; hence, in no small measure the enormous reduction in the demand for Lancashire goods which has hit our textile industries so hard. Despite the growth of its population, India consumed in 1933-34, of cotton goods either produced at home Or imported, some 200 million yards less than in 1913-14. Clearly there is need in the interests of India itself to adopt a monetary policy which will increase the purchasing power of that great sub-continent and enable its masses to enjoy a higher standard of living, which would benefit them and us alike. Indian railways, also, are in need of a great deal of further development, if the economic conditions, and thereby the purchasing capacity, of the Indian peasants are to be raised.Apart from these measures of reform, there is room for considerable improvement in the export trade of Lancashire to India and other tropical lands by means of a better organisation
of its marketing system. Indeed, the trade of our principal industries could to some extent be improved even in the markets of developed countries by efficient organisation that would enable them to produce and sell their goods on the most favourable competitive terms. Our export trade in coal, iron and steel would have a definitely better prospect of expansion if these industries were brought fully up to date as regards their equipment and marketing organisation. It is also reasonable to suppose that a skilful and firm handling of fiscal negotiations with other countries could be. made fruitful of reduced tariff barriers and better openings for trade. The policy of protection to which this country is now committed should be utilised unhesitatingly to force consent to those trade bargains which we are in a stronger position than any other country to make, since we are by far the biggest international trading country in the world. A vigorous and enlightened policy for the expansion of our overseas trade would also benefit our shipping and lift it out of the quicksand of despair in which it is sinking.There is also a possible field for expansion of export trade in terms of new products less likely to be affected by fiscal obstacles. Britain originally captured the world market by offering goods which could not be obtained anywhere else. With our inventive resources, backed by organised research and technical experience, we shall certainly continue to make new contributions to the amenities of world civilisation and break new ground for export trade. The recent increase in the export of British electrical apparatus, dye-stuffs,&apos; motor cars and certain types of machinery are, perhaps, illustrations of such a process.But so long as the policy of other countries is wedded to ideas of &quot;economic nationalism,&quot; our chief field for industrial expansion must lie within our doors and within the vast confines of the Empire. In both directions there is obviously immense scope.At home the nation is as yet far from being adequately housed, clothed, fed, and supplied all round with a reasonable standard of comforts and amenities. In view of the immense increase in om-capacity to produce wealth which has been furnished by the application of mechanical power, it is impossible to set a limit upon the upward movement of the general standard of life which the citizens not only of this country, but of the world, might reasonably expect to enjoy.This process is continually going on. The home market quickly learns to establish new demands and absorb new conveniences  witness, for example, the rapid spread of radio apparatus in the last ten years.In addition to the large field for expansion in the direct production of saleable -goods for the home market, there is great scope for improving the services and amenities of the community. Here, too, the work is profitable to the nation even if only indirectly. The clearance of slums and the provision of adequate Housing accommoda-tion would furnish a valuable addition to the Nation&apos;s property, and to its health and efficiency. The improvement of roads and of bridges, docks, harbours and canals would increase the national wealth by facilitating its business and removing costly delays and inconveniences.. Improvements of water supply, of drainage and sanitation, of electricity and gas, would enrich the nation in terms of its health and working capacity. A revival of agriculture would bring into profit-able cultivation wide areas now undercultivated or derelict.It must in this connection be emphasised that if our millions of unemployed are brought into full and continuous wage-earning they will at once furnish a market for the increased output of goods a market at present heavily in arrears as regards the supply of its requirements.(c) The Forgotten Countryside.First place among our potential resources at home which are capable of being exploited to give work to the unemployed and to increase national wealth must be taken by the land of the country. This subject is dealt with at length in Chapter IX.
(d) The Colonies.There can be no. doubt that the production of our Colonies is capable of vast development: that their purchasing power can thereby be multiplied greatly : that this increase in production will be almost entirely in the form of goods which do not compete with British industry and that the expansion will be beneficial to the native popu-lations, the white settlers, British shipping and to employment in the industrial areas of Britain.The present standard of life in the Crown Colonies cannot be accepted as satisfactory. There is no reason why the will and the capacity to purchase should not be as high in Nigeria as it is in Algeria, which is in full customs union with France.There is no reason why the standard of living in Jamaica should not be as high as that of Porto Bico, which is in customs union with the United States.The Beports of the Imperial Economic Committee make it perfectly clear that an increase in the production of many important kinds of raw materials is possible in the Crown Colonies.In times of normal trading, we import every year from foreign countries commodities to the value of  150 million of a kind which the Crown Colonies can supply : fruit, vegetable products, oils, spices, tea and coffee, mineral ores, metals, hardwoods, seeds, hides and skins. The Colonies could, to their advantage, supply us with more of these commodities than they do. There is immense room for expansion in colonial production in the British market alone. It must also be borne in mind that increased exports from the Crown Colonies to Great Britain are paid for by increased exports from Great Britain to the Colonies and that the export trade from these islands to the Crown Colonies is almost entirely an export of manufactured goods and beverages.Apart altogether from the possibilities of increased purchases by Great Britain, the resources of the Crown Colonies may also be developed by the creation of new markets in other parts of the world. There are many commodities produced in the Crown Colonies which the United States and Germany must have. France also requires certain raw materials which she can only obtain from our Empire. Present production is capable of increase, new products are capable of development.The advantage to the outlying portions of the Empire is obvious, but in helping others, we shall also help ourselves. We shall be sowing a crop for Britain and the manufacturing population of Britain and we shall certainly, at no distant date, reap where we have sown.Chapter III. Basis of a Solution.To restate our problem : We have&apos; over 2 million workers unemployed.We have immense capital resources, which are not at present financing any really useful production.We have possibilities of increased industrial activity, limited by artificial restrictions as regards the foreign market, but almost unlimited at home and in the Empire.We have vast undeveloped and under-developed potentialities in our own soil.We have at our doors a ready market which can even at present low prices absorb hundreds of millions&apos; worth of the produce our soil is capable of yielding. With the improved standard of living which would inevitably accompany prosperity the demand would be largely expanded, and prices would become more remunerative.How can we introduce into our economic system a sound organi-sation which will bring into fruitful alliance the workers, the money and the opportunities?Our present methods will not do this. That is clear, for they are failing under our eyes to do it. They failed, during the ten years, before the recent world-wide depression began, to deal with a problem only half as serious-the refractory 1 million of unemployed with which we were then faced.
This is not a reflection on the value of private enterprise. But there are limits to what it can accomplish unaided. The scope of our post-war economic conditions: has outgrown those limits.Modern industrial developments and their inter-dependence have now become immense and complex. Private enterprise has achieved marvels of organisation. But a stage comes when the scale of enterprise grows too big to be left entirely unaided and uncontrolled to private hands. It becomes a matter vitally affecting the interests of the community as a whole, so that in its own interests the community must share the responsibility for maintaining and further developing the organisation.The duty of the community to take action in such conditions is now generally recognised. There are already a number of examples  various in their character and perhaps in their merits of inter-vention by the nation in its corporate capacity to control and share the financial responsibility for enterprises affecting its well-being. As examples of this may be quoted the London Traffic Control Board, the Port of London Authority, the Central Electricity Board, the various Marketing Boards for Agriculture, the Forestry Commission and the Town Planning Authorities.Such intervention does not mean the elimination of private enterprise. But it does mean that where necessary the State may furnish the guarantee of its own credit to ensure sound, economic progress, and that private enterprise and initiative are stimulated, -assisted, directed and controlled in the public interest.Since private enterprise is palpably unable to solve our problem unaided, and since the problem must be solved, there is obviously only one possible course open: the administrative and financial resources of the nation as a whole must be made responsible for setting on foot those developments in town and country which will bring into fruitful activity our unutilised labour, our idle capital, our undeveloped resources and opportunities.The nation must set up machinery which can take in hand the task of surveying our industrial and agricultural possibilities; of planning how best to realise them; and of furnishing such financial assistance on the basis of the national credit, as may be needed to carry out the proposed developments and enterprises. In the past, successive Governments have already done this kind of thing sporadically by rule of thumb in isolated cases. We propose that henceforward they shall do it systematically and deliberately, according to well thought out plans, and that a permanent administrative organ shall be set up for the purpose.Chapter IV. The Central Machinery.We propose that the Government shall set up, as a permanent body, a National Development Board.Com/position.In its personnel the Board should consist of persons drawn from industry, commerce, finance, workers and consumers. While ultimately responsible to the Government, it should stand apart from political interference in its actual operations like the B.B.C., the Central&apos;Electricity Board, the Port of London Authority.Functions.It should be the duty of the Board: (a) To take a survey of the industrial, agricultural and financial resources and potentialities of this country with a view to reporting on practicable developments which would increase employment and enhance the national prosperity, wealth and well-being.(b) To prepare and approve plans for land development, indus-trial organisation, improvement of the nation&apos;s services, amenities and cultural and recreational facilities, and the better utilisation of our resources, our credit and our man-power.(c) To consider the application of the national credit with a viewto the proper financing of the programmes it proposes to carry out.
1jThe Board would in short be a Board to consider definite plans of action. It would be there to get things done, but done in pursuance of carefully thought-out schemes. It would naturally work in close co-operation with the existing departments of State and would co-ordinate their operations where more than one of them was. involved in some new development scheme.The National Development Board would have its own special sections to deal with the different functions of research, planning and finance. And it would utilise existing machinery or recommend the creation of fresh bodies to be responsible respectively for land development, industrial development, power and communications, and external trade.Both directly and through the special boards and commissions which it would set up, the National Development Board would bring-under constant review the whole field of national effort, with special reference to the need for expanding this effort in ways which would aid the reinstatement of our 2 million workless in regular employment. The elimination of that burden of persistent unemploy-ment must clearly be the first charge upon the planning capacity of the new Department. But we are far from suggesting that the Board should limit itself entirely to this objective. It should be charged to act as a permanent authority for reviewing, guiding and planning the economic progress of the nation, and directing its financial resources into the most beneficial channels of investment.The Board and the Cabinet.The National Development Board would report its recommenda-tions to the Prime Minister, who would submit them for consideration by the Cabinet. The Government would sanction and authorise such of the recommendations as it approved, after considering them in Cabinet.It is quite obvious that a Cabinet constituted on the lines of the existing body, as an assembly of about a score of Departmental executive ministers, each deeply immersed in the problems and claims of his own branch of the public service, is an utterly unsuitable body to give full and dispassionate consideration to bold schemes of national reconstruction, such as the Board may be expected to put forward. Whatever the virtues of a big Committee of this kind for deliberative purposes in leisurely times, it is not suited for a thorough and consecutive study of the vast and varied problems arising out of a great emergency, and it is definitely unfitted for swift constructive activity in times of crisis. During the war we eventually found it essential to dispense with the traditional Cabinet of Departmental Ministers, and substitute for it a small Executive of four or five Ministers without portfolios, who could devote their whole time to settling plans of action in face of the national emergency.It is questionable whether any advantage has been reaped by our subsequent reversion to the old-model Cabinet. It is certainly hopeless to expect swift decision and resolute action from that kind of Cabinet in face of our present emergency of national unemploy-ment. We therefore propose that the Cabinet shall be constituted, as in the War, of the Prime Minister and four or five Ministers without departmental duties, who can co-operate with him in giving their whole time to reviewing and settling the action of the Govern-ment on the issues which arise. The Chancellor of the Exchequer-would obviously have to be a member of such a body, as all its. decisions would affect his department. To this body the National Development Board will submit its schemes, and such a Cabinet will be able to ensure the co-operation of the Departments of State in the carrying out of approved plans. Departments concerned with the subject-matter of such plans would of course be given an opportunity of reviewing them and presenting their views on them to the Cabinet.Such a Cabinet would possess the further advantage that it would be a far more efficient body than the existing Cabinet for dealing, with schemes of development affecting the Empire as a whole.. While in the present proposals we are mainly concerned with a domestic problem, we recognise that it is closely associated with possible developments in the Empire overseas, and that their promotion must play an important part in helping forward the. provision of work for the home population.
Chaptee V. Finance.The part to be played by Finance in any programme of national development is obviously of fundamental importance. Financial difficulties have a large responsibility for the failure of private enterprise to cope successfully with our present problem. Either there is no machinery by which the savings of the public can be conveniently invested in a particular enterprise where the capital outlay of an enterprise is too small to invite public subscription as is the case with farming; or there is too much uncertainty as to the safety and dividend yield of capital- as is largely the case with industrial projects during this period of crisis through which the world is passing; or, as in the case of housing, private enterprise cannot provide sufficient accommodation at reasonable rents; or the benefits which would accrue as, for example, an improvement of transport and road facilities might enure to the advantage of others without profits to a private investor.Any new project obviously involves a financial risk. Private investors are to-day taking all the risks they care to run. Those who are responsible for directing the investment of the nation&apos;s savings bankers, &amp;c, are nervous of adding to the heavy risks and liabilities they have already incurred lest they jeopardise the stability&apos; of the institutions of which they are in charge. Consequently, if larger schemes are to be set on foot, or if existing industries are to be urged to venture on big schemes of reconstruction which are beyond the limit of their existing resources, in order to serve the national interest, then the burden of risk involved must not be thrown upon the shoulders of any small private groups of investors or capitalists, but must be shared by the community as a whole.There is a further advantage in this. While it is by no means easy at the moment for industry to attract investment, it is very easy for the State, in the present condition of the money market, to borrow to almost any extent at a very low rate of interest. Accordingly, big programmes of development for land and industry could be carried out at the present time with the utmost economy if their financing is based upon the credit of the nation.It is, therefore, proposed that when reconstruction and develop-rnent schemes, which involve for their achievement a long-term investment- of considerable capital, are duly recommended by the Board and sanctioned by the Government and by Parliament, then a State guarantee will be given for the service of the requisite capital loans.To this end the National Development Board will keep itself constantly informed as to the amount of unused current savings in the country, not at the moment serving any productive purpose, which could be hypothecated to finance approved development schemes.Just as the Chancellor of the Exchequer examines year by year the amount of annual revenue which the Government can wisely collect from the commun^ to maintain services of national importance, and allocates this yearly income between the Departments of State in accordance with the relative importance of their claims, so the National Development Board would make its estimate of the amount of capital which would be available for investment in the various fields of national development and reconstruction, and subject to parliamentary sanction would distribute the State guarantees accordingly.It is not proposed to interfere with the machinery for financing the business of the country, or with any individual&apos;s choice of his investment; but&apos; beyond the sums needed for the transaction of the business affairs and enterprises of the community, there is a surplus available for investment at home and abroad, which has no adequate productive outlet under present world conditions. This valuable asset ought not to remain idle when there is so much essential work to be accomplished in the highest interests of the nation.It is essential for the satisfactory working of such a policy that the community should be in final control of its own monetary system. Accordingly, it is proposed that the constitution of the Bank of England should be changed.  For this there is ample precedent.   The-
Central Banks of France, Germany, Italy and indeed of most civilised countries are State institutions. It is a curious anomaly that the Bank of England, the heart of the most important money market in the world, at the centre of the world&apos;s greatest Empire, should still be a close corporation. It must be placed under the control of a Board suitably representing the financial, industrial and commercial interests of the nation, and responsible to the community for their stewardship.Chapter VI. Urban Housing and Kegional Development.If we test the housing conditions of this country by applying to them the essential attributes of a healthy home, there is an appalling deficiency in town and country of dwelling-places which satisfy the minimum requirements of space, air, light, sanitation, salubrious and pleasant environment, and accessibility to work and to open spaces and playgrounds. These are all conditions insisted upon by all who can afford to obtain them, and with wise planning and effective organisation they can and ought to be made available for all classes of the community.The significance of the census returns of 1931 has quite naturally appalled the conscience of the country. The fact that 397,000 families, or nearly 4 per cent, of all the families in the country, are living at a density of more than two persons per room, and this after the great effort which has been made since the War, by which 21 million houses have been built with and without State assistance, calls for far greater vision and effort than is indicated in our present Housing policy.Dealing with the housing requirements in the immediate future, the Housing volume of the Census Beports, 1931 (Part IV), after an exhaustive analysis of the position, concludes that a total of 1,700,000 houses will be required by 1941. This figure, however, is regarded by most housing reformers as the minimum, and many of them place it at a.much higher figure. Indeed, having regard to the number of early nineteenth century buildings which still exist, the figure might well be put much higher. Once the fundamental principle is accepted that it is a public responsibility to provide housing accommodation, not below a minimum standard for every family in the United Kingdom, at a rent within the family capacity to pay, the question that the country has to face is how the job can be done most efficiently and quickly.At no time in the history of the country has such an opportunity arisen as we have to-day for inaugurating a vigorous policy of reconditioning and replanning our towns and villages. Cheap money, unemployment caused by economic dislocation, and the advantages of the modern application of power and transport, all favour immediate action. The country needs to visualise the problem as a whole, nationally, regionally and locally, and to act boldly.Important as it is that the houses should be provided at rents within the ability of the occupiers to pay, it is no less important that they should be built in the right places. We must not only select the best places for the new houses in order that the occupants may enjoy the fullest amenities of life, but we must encourage new industries to settle in their vicinity in properly zoned areas. Also old industries, in whole or part, must be encouraged to move from cramped sites and obsolete buildings in the centre to more commodious and efficient factories in the new districts.The Development Board should be in a position to offer financial facilities to industrialists for the purpose of rebuilding their factories, mills and workshops in definitely planned locations at a reasonable distance from the centre. A policy of the gradual removal of existing work-places from the centre, and the attraction of new industry to the new locations, should be coupled with a considered housing policy by.which houses would be provided in proximity to the works in these selected areas, so that the industrialists may be assured of a sufficient supply of labour.While it must be accepted that a large number of people desire to live in fiats, and that it is necessary that blocks of tenements
should be provided, it is of the utmost importance to limit their number, not only by reason of their inherent disadvantages from the point of view of the family, but in order to enable the replanning of the central districts upon more open lines. The disadvantages of life in tenements as compared, with life in cottage homes with gardens are obvious, especially in the case of families with children. The strong and valuable tradition of home life, which is characteristic of the British people, and a principal factor in social stability and contentment, is stimulated by the family occupancy of self-contained dwellings with the privacy and sense of individuality which the small house provides in a far greater degree than the flat. The tenement in the centre cannot carry with it the private garden, the playing-fields and the accessibility to the countryside which the cottage can carry with it.All the conditions of to-day permit in fact they demands -an entirely new view of the distribution of population and industry. Comparatively few industries are, in fact, anchored by economic necessity to particular locations. Many industries, it is true, must be located close to minerals, dockyards, harbours, or to certain markets, or to allied industries, but a large proportion of industrial unite might, under present mobile conditions, function with equal efficiency in any one of a large range of locations. A Committee appointed by the Minister of Health to consider and advise on the principles to be followed in dealing with unhealthy areas, which sat under, the chairmanship of Mr. Neville Chamberlain in 1920, came to the conclusion that many of the factories now located in London might apparently have been placed elsewhere without any disadvantage to themselves. This general conclusion may be said to apply to many of the large cities in this country where congestion and overcrowding exists.Any policy of slum clearance and the reduction of overcrowding should therefore be directed not only to the provision of accommoda-tion in the centre but to the transference of as many as possible to districts where there is more room and where the conditions of life will be more ample. If a substantial part of the population in our towns could be located in the country around, there would be no overcrowding for the rest. It is the first duty of the Nation to ensure that all&apos; its homes shall be adequately supplied with fresh air and sunlight, and have access to open spaces. The well-to-do have always been able to enjoy these assets. As our great cities expanded and their centres became less and less attractive for residence, the wealth)&apos; have moved to the outskirts in search of open country. Modern improvements of travel facilities of the last century have enabled the middle classes also to join in this drift to the country, and around all our great cities large dormitory suburbs have sprung up where people live, travelling to and from business. Many workers who have housing accommodation within easy access to their daily avocations have no desire to change. Many also prefer town life, but there are large numbers who would for the sake of their children choose to live outside the town, but find themselves unable to afford the cost of and time for travelling, and have, therefore, remained in the centre, where the pressure of demand upon the supply of accommodation has led to overcrowding. Travelling facilities are quite inadequate to meet the demands of any considerable movement of the population to and from the towns to the outskirts. The work places and the living places should be grouped within easy reach of each other so far as possible, and where this is not practicable the need should be met by organising special transport facilities at low rates.(!)The prcmotion and execution of a comprehensive policy of re-housing and planning involve overcoming grave difficulties. The local administrative machinery is not well adapted to carrying it out. The districts where the slums exist may be, and often are, under a different authority from that where the inhabitants ought to be re-housed. Efforts have been made&apos; to deal with these difficulties by associating local authorities in joint regional Planning Committees. Some 80 of these have been formed, and nearly half of them&apos; (&apos;) (The problem of transport and inter alia its relation to housing and town planning is further referred to in Chapter VII, page 19.)
have completed regional plans for the areas with which they are concerned. The regional machinery must be closely linked up with the administrative departments of the Ministries on the one hand, and the local authorities on the other. . The present Housing and Town Planning Department of the Ministry of Health should be supplemented. There must be consistent purpose and driving force at&quot; the centre k&apos; The local authorities already possess very considerable powers to carry out wide-scale development. If there are any weaknesses which prevent or hinder the fullest and most efficient schemes of development, they should be removed. If it is necessary and advisable to embark upon development outside the administrative area of a particular local authority there should be machinery in the shape of a joint or regional&apos; authority to enable this to be done. No, rivalries or vested interests of adjoining authorities should be allowed to hamper the carrying out of a well-conceived, reasonable and advantageous plan.In this connection there would be large-scale schemes, the carrying out of which would not only create a large amount of new employment, but would permanently improve the conditions of life and amenity for the nation. With adequate financial assistance, such as the National Development Board would be empowered to render, much of this work could be undertaken by the local authorities concerned, working in co-operation with each other and the transport companies and authorities.But there are other large-scale schemes which ought to be put in hand for the setting up of satellite towns, for the drastic clearance of slums and the driving of new avenues to the outskirts through congested areas, like the East End of London, which only the State can undertake. For example, the scheme which was under consideration not long ago for constructing such an avenue in the Lea Valley and driving it clear through the East End of London down to the docks is too big a project for any existing local authority or group of authorities to undertake unaided. While the financial responsibilities involved in a scheme of this order would obviously be large, the advantages due to increased efficiency and improved conditions, both for living and working, would be commensurately great. The fact that all these advantages cannot be traced to and payment secured for them from each person who benefits by the saving in time and exhaustion, by the increased efficiency of his work and in the pleasure of his life, does not diminish the public advantage resulting from the enterprise, it merely justifies the bearing of part of the cost, if necessary, by the public. But this cost might be recouped if steps were taken to secure for the public a fair share of the betterment values which would be created. It is well known that immense new land values are created when new transport facilities open up an area for housing develop-ment. Bound Golders Green and Edgware, vast fortunes were made for landowners and land speculators by the advent of the Tube  fortunes which paid no tribute at all towards the cost of the transport service which gave rise to them. If measures are enforced to secure the betterment value created by the new schemes for transport and regional development, either by purchase of the land at the value before the improvement schemes were launched, or by taxation of those improved values, or by other more controversial and less effective methods, they will suffice not only to recoup the original outlay, but to furnish a fund for cheapening the transport and other amenities of the new residential districts. If those who must work in the centres of large towns are to be able to live in semi-rural surroundings, there must be for them a system of cheap fiat-rate &quot;fares, and quick, non-stop services by bus, tube, tram or train to bring them swiftly to their job. . -Impediments to large-scale land purchase by the local authorities should be removed and purchase should be encouraged in order that the increment in land value caused by the&apos; development may accrue to the local authorities, and through them to the community. No large-scale planning can be efficiently carried out unless the right to acquire the freehold where necessary is vested in the body which operates the scheme. The control of development in the vicinity of towns will prevent ribbon development with its admitted evils.. When the full responsibility for the planning and development of
the country surrounding a town is accepted by the properly consti-tnted &quot;local authority,&quot; and adequate statutory powers to carry out such development are given to such local authority, the question of the preservation of open spaces and the difficult problem of compen-sation are to a large extent solved. The value added to the land owned by the local authority by reason of the preservation of the open spaces reserved from building in the vicinity should fully cover the cost of compensation. In some cases the local authorities may deem it advisable to make arrangements by which the develop-ment shall-be carried out by the owners (or group of owners) of the land. In such cases arrangements for financial facilities for development which already exist in the Housing Acts might well be coupled with conditions for contribution to the fund necessary for the compensation of these owners of land which is preserved for building.Belgium, as densely populated as ourselves, treats her industrial population far more wisely than we do. Of the dockers who work-in Antwerp, 80 per cent, live in the surrounding country, and the bulk of them have substantial gardens attached to their houses. When there is no work at the docks, they do not hang about all day waiting for something to turn up, but go home and work in their gardens. Thus, when not working for wages, they are profitably occupied on the soil. Seasonal workers, such as bricklayers, benefit in a similar way. In Germany to-day the same system is being extensively developed by means of settlements for industrial workers on the borders of the town in cottages equipped with small allotment gardens. In America also the encouragement of subsistence home-steads by the Federal Government has a similar end in view. A private garden, however small, is both an economic and a sociological advantage. There a man can occupy his spare time by growing produce which helps the household budget, and there the family can enjoy fresh air and sunshine without disturbance. It is a remarkable, but unchallengeable fact, that the development of a normal agricul-tural area for housing can increase the agricultural output per acre. This output, though not measured statistically in national returns, is, nevertheless, real and valuable. (2)Under the heading of regional development, there are now various other improvements of the public services and amenities which could with advantage be expedited. reference may be made to the con-struction and improvement of roads, the provision of main water supply, open spaces and playing fields. In connection with schemes of rehousing and the establishment of Garden Suburbs and satellite towns, the plans must fully cover the amenities of these new districts, and their requirements, not only for shelter but for shopping, amuse-ments and cultural and moral education. These community facilities are as vital in a housing scheme as is the provision of healthy dwellings.To sum up the position : the problem of housing, urban develop ment, and regional planning cannot satisfactorily be dealt with piece-meal, or solely from the point of view of individual authorities administering local areas which bear no relation to national considera-tions or to the regional limits within which alone the problems can be co-ordinated.  It will be observed there are the two problems  (a) That of central re-planning and re-development on a general basis, permitting adequate space for all .those activities which should be centrally placed to be carried on efficiently, which means without crowding, and providing proper amenities for those who must live in the central areas.(b) That of promoting bold and planned decentralisation, both for those activities which could be more advantageously and efficiently caried on in more spacious surroundings on the outskirts and for the dwelling places of those engaged in them; also for the many who, while working in the central area, prefer to live in the more open areas outside.This involves both the planning and promotion of new develop-ments in the form of satellite units of development as self-contained and as completely equipped as practicable, and the preservation from(2) Rural Housing is dealt with in Chapter IX, page 31.
building use of adequate open space in relation to each such unit. Even in regard to the section of the problem understood as housing, any satisfactory and economical solution must depend on a planned programme co-ordinating all the factors, such as distribution of work-places, transport facilities, the provision of an adequate supply of dwellings within the reach of those needing them, the clearance of slum areas, the reconditioning of existing dwellings to tide over the transition period, or, where their condition justifies it, to serve a further period of useful life, and the bringing of such dwellings under enlightened management helpful to the tenants as well as efficient in the maintenance of the dwellings.This need for co-ordinated action in development and housing is evident in regard to all growing towns of whatever size and wherever situated; it is not a mere London problem, though naturally owing to its great size the problems are; immensely greater and more difficult there.Glaring examples of want of planning are found not only in connection with London, as in the industrial development at Slough, hampered for years for want of houses for the workers or the development of extensive housing at Becontree, which those working in the district were not at first allowed to occupy because they were built to serve central London, but in other smaller towns the same kind of thing is happening. There is a notable case where in one of our most beautiful university towns a great factory has been erected on one side and a subsidiary industry placed on the other, thus adding quite needlessly to the traffic, which is already threatening the historic buildings of the City.Even more important than the physical and economic considera-tions is the maintenance and development of healthy community life and relations. Crowds are no less dangerous to social stability than they are to health and efficiency. The need is urgent to group the large populations of our cities in units which will promote the good community relations which follow from the daily association of people of varied occupations and conditions, in place of those which alone can result from herding large crowds of wealthy folk in one district and still larger crowds of those who have the least cause to be satisfied with life in another.A great deal of the work outlined in this Chapter will take time to plan and prepare, but there is much of it that can be put in hand without loss of time. roads, through, from, and into the towns could be undertaken. Tubes could be extended. The process of re-conditioning and re-building for the proper housing of those who would prefer to remain in the cities could be proceeded with on more intelligent lines, when it was realised that it was part of a wider and more comprehensive plan for the rehousing of the urban population. It ought not to take more than a year for that larger-plan to get going.Chapter VII. Power and Communications. (a) Transport.The Ministry of Transport must be given active assistance by the National Development Board for the preparation, financing, and carrying through of plans for the improvement of our transport services.The ultimate aim of transport organisation should, there is little doubt, be to bring the whole of the nation&apos;s transport services, by road, rail, inland waterway and air, under one centralised and co-ordinated public control. This, however, is a measure which will require to be very carefully worked out in its details, in close consultation with the interests concerned, and it will take some time to carry into effect. There is, in the meantime, a great deal that can and should be done forthwith to improve these services and make them better adapted to present-day needs. And this work has the further merit that it would provide employment on a large scale, and give a much-needed stimulus to a number of industries, including those hard-hit by the present depression.
(i) Roads.Par-reaching reforms of our road conditions are needed with an urgency that cannot be overstated. In the last ten years the number of motor vehicles on our roads has doubled; and the number is now growing by upwards of 100,000 every year. They have long become an indispensable factor in our national economy, and their manufacture and repair employ upwards of a quarter of a million workers, while a still larger number are employed on road transport services. But the road system on which they travel was never designed for such traffic, and the efforts which have in recent years been made to bring it up to date are only in their early stages, and fall very far short of what is really necessary.The tragic figures of road accidents are a grim witness to our present failure to adapt the road system to its new task. A recent investigation into the causes of fatal road accidents in Oxfordshire over two years, 1932-34, by the County Surveyor reveals that the majority occurred at cross-roads, junctions, severe bends or curves which had not been improved in accordance with modern road necessities, while not a single fatal accident occurred at any intersection, bend or curve which had been so improved. Faulty road lay-out was found to be a contributory cause in nearly 60 per cent, of all fatal accidents in the country, and would have been prevented by modernising the lay-out of the roads at typical danger-spots.Our trunk road system ought to be completed with all despatch, and the whole structure of the main roads altered and improved with a view to making them into dual one-way tracks for vehicles, furnished, in addition, with foot-paths and cycle tracks. The provision of special tracks for cyclists is a matter of the greatest urgency, in order to secure greater safety on the roads. According to the figures of the Ministry of Transport, one in four of those injured and nearly one in five of those killed on the roads is a &apos;pedal cyclist; and of the increase in road accidents between 1928 and 1933, 54 per cent, of the injuries and 62 per cent, of the deaths were of pedal cyclists, who are to-day regarded as constituting the major part of the problem of road accidents. Further, roundabouts or fly-over crossings are needed at all important road junctions. The bridges on the roads need strengthening. It has been announced that there are 2,000 weak bridges in the country calling for such treatment. Level crossings should be eliminated. Very many of the roads need widening, and reconstructing to eliminate dangerous camber.There is also great need for the improvement of secondary and district roads to meet the needs of modern traffic, which is increasingly pouring into them. They are being used more and more to-day, alike for business and for recreation. Any policy of agricultural revival which increases the population in the countryside will enhance the importance of these local roads. Reference is made elsewhere to the importance of improving the purely rural roads which serve the local needs of farmers and villagers. It is obvious that to put into effect any efficient marketing scheme involving regular collection of farm produce, there will have to be a network of good roads, traversable by lorries serving the farms and connecting our agricultural areas with the main trunk traffic routes.But in addition to such measures, which affect the ordinary road provision, there are a number of big projects which might be put in hand by the Government; projects which have been recommended by competent experts, and some of which have even been examined and approved by Parliament. Among these are the Dartford-Purfleet tunnel and the Charing Cross Bridge. The Cromwell Road extension, the Everton Tunnel at Liverpol, and the Tyne Tunnel, are also projects of this order, as is the Severn Bridge. Other proposals which have been put forward by well-informed advisers include a bridge across the Thames at Woolwich, one across the Humber at Hull, the Forth Bridge, and a new bridge at Menai. We recommend that all such schemes should be brought under examina-tion by competent experts, and where, after full consideration, it is decided to proceed with them, they should forthwith be expedited. All such schemes would, in addition to being valuable and remunerative additions to the nation&apos;s transport equipment, have the
advantage that they would provide a very large amount of direct and indirect employment.Reference has already been made to the road developments which will be necessary in connection with schemes of regional development for housing and industry. Therewith must be associated the improve-ment and co-ordination of railway and harbour developments in conjunction with sound zoning and planning policies looking toward the most efficient distribution of industry and population. The basis of a national trunk system of roads is not the traffic which exists on certain highways under the present chaotic conditions, but the traffic-movement which would result from a comprehensively planned and co-ordinated system of transportation and a better planned and distributed urban and rural development. The Ministry of Transport will be able to render invaluable service in this field of co-operation with the development Board and with regional authorities.&apos; The growth of the great urban centres was largely ,the result of the railway, and we are continuing to stimulate an artificial and excessive concentration by means of the motor vehicle instead of using this elastic means of transport to secure a more efficient distribution of industrial population. Our haphazard methods of developing trans-port are a major cause in producing haphazard development and congestion of urban areas. Locally these methods influence the system of growth of large cities, and affect problems of location distribution and congestion, and the sprawling suburban spread which is, visible&apos; round London and other great towns. Local transport is an integral part of the housing problem. Housing cannot be effectively dealt with unless there is, first, great improvement in the facilities for moving persons and goods; and second, Government aid to make this improvement result in cheaper travel.In a large city there are now four necessities for existence : food, clothing, shelter and travel. Travel is a fairly expensive new item associated with shelter, and its cost has to be met out of higher wages in the great centres or counter-balanced by savings in cost of housing on the outskirts.The great secret of convenience in the situation of houses in great cities is to provide dwellings within the least possible time-and-cost distance of varied opportunities for work and amenity. Given proper communications, that point is more likely to be on the outskirts of the city than in its depths. In London to-day, for example, it takes as long to get from one place to another within the heart of the metropolis as travel into the centre from a point some way outside.Probably the first need in order to secure improved housing and more efficient conditions for industry in and near London and our other big cities, is the development of cheaper and more rapid transport between the developed areas and suburbs and satellite communities. Tubes or tramways will be required to serve some of the new developments which have been elsewhere proposed, and it is suggested that financial assistance in an appropriate form should be available to secure that adequte transport facilities are provided and that the cost of travel to and from places of work is kept low. At the same time it must be added that mere extension and cheapening of transport is not the whole of the solution. Transport must be planned in co-ordination with a better organised system for distributing both industry and population.The internal transport of our bigger cities needs to be very care-fully surveyed with a view to the adoption of some really bold measure of reform to eliminate in particular the congestion of goods transport. Various schemes for dealing with this problem have been prepared by competent engineers, and these should be brought under examination. Where it appears that any such schemes are practicable and economic-ally sound, the necessary steps should be taken without delay to promote their adoption and execution.The work which could be done in road improvement in this country work which is urgently required, alike for efficiency and for safety is, in fact, limitless. No programme which could possibly be carried out in the next five years, or ten years, would exhaust the need immediately visible. The limits upon the volume of work that can be wisely expended in this field are only those imposed by considerations of available finance, available workers, and the administrative problems
of securing agreement and co-operation between central and local authorities.As regards finance, it must be pointed out that a definite provision for this was made as long ago as 1909, when what is now the Road Fund was set up, furnished with a revenue specially provided by the taxation of motor vehicles. When after the war the rate of that taxation- was increased to meet the needs of a great campaign of road improvement, an assurance was given that these levies would in fact be set aside for that purpose only. It cannot but be a matter for profound regret, in view of the magnitude of the need for road improvement, that exchequer difficulties have led to the confiscation of the whole of the Road Fund&apos;s reserves, and to the placing of a levy upon its income which diverts upwards of  5 million a year of its revenue to the exchequer.Despite these discouragements, the revenue from motor taxes has proved surprisingly resilient. It has more than doubled in the last ten years, and in 1933-34 amounted to  31^ million. If it maintains its present rate of growth, it will increase by more than  1 million a year, despite the recent reduction in the horse-power tax. After paying out from the net income of the Road Fund the sums annually allotted to local authorities for repair and main-tenance of highways, there will still be a margin of anything from  7 to  10 million a year, which could be utilised, not only for special programmes, but as a revenue, upon the security of which capital loans for major road developments could be raised. If the amount that could be so utilised were no higher than  7 million a year, that would suffice to serve and amortise in 60 years a capital loan of  200 million at 3 per cent. While it is realised that  200 million could not be immediately spent, the figure indicates that if plans were prepared there should be no difficulty in raising the capital to meet the commitments involved. If, further, the present practice of levying on the Road Fund for general exchequer purposes were abandoned, there would be a further  5 million a year available for financing road improvements. It is clear, therefore, that the financial aspect of road development need present no serious problem.Road developments employ a large amount of labour, directly and indirectly in a wide range of tasks, skilled and unskilled. They have the special merit that they offer jobs on a considerable scale to unemployed manual workers, and would provide work for numbers of those in the distressed areas, especially upon schemes which could be carried out with advantage in or near those areas.The most serious difficulty in the way of expediting big pro-grammes of road developments is the completing of negotiations with the local highway authorities, in whose hands normally rests the actual carrying out of road work. In order to expedite a programme on a really large scale, very strenuous efforts m&apos;ill be necessary to elicit their good-will and earnest co-operation, and on the financial side it should be possible to offer them inducements which will relieve them of intelligible anxieties that might otherwise make them reluctant to adopt bold schemes.(ii) Railways.As already&apos; stated, it is desirable that careful consideration should be given to the issue of adopting measures for further unifying the railroad services of the country, and bringing them under an increased degree of national control. Thereby their co-operation with schemes of development and the service of industry and agri-culture could be directed without the delay and inconvenience attendant on negotiations with rival corporations. Such control Tvould make it much easier, with the financial guarantee of the State, to carry out the process of electrification especially for short distances and in the suburbs of the larger cities. There is also considerable scope for the improvement of railway rolling-stock and the organisation of a more efficient use of goods waggons. Terminals also stand in need of improvement. They will not stand comparison with many American, Dominion and Continental stations.But whether or no it is decided to proceed forthwith to such unification under public control, there is a need for the better organisa-tion of the railways in the public interest,  and for suburban
electrification and reform of the structure and use of rolling-stock  measures which would be economically beneficial and would give use-iul employment. It is recommended that financial help should be furnished, maybe under the machinery of the Trade Facilities Acts, to enable work of this,nature to be put promptly in hand.(iii) Air Transport.Through the Air Ministry, the Board will put in hand measures to develop the air services of the nation and of the Empire. More air-ports are needed, and the siting of these and their provision are a national concern involving planning on a national scale, and capital expenditure for which the Board will have to provide funds or guarantees. It is hardly creditable to us that with all our mechanical skill and our extensive Empire, we are far behind several other countries in our use of the air for commercial transport and passenger traffic. Wise investment in air development is extremely desirable, whether for peace, or for defence in the event of danger to the nation. A large number of high-class machines and of trained pilots would be a source of security to this country. If a great air service for this country and for speedy communication with every part of the Empire were built up, we should have at our disposal the finest air fleet in the world. For this reason special attention should be directed to the organisation of a great Imperial service.(iv) Canals.The canals of the country are one of our most neglected assets. There is no civilised country in Europe where less use is made of inland water transport. Admittedly Britain is not quite so well adapted to the development of such waterways as some continental lands, which are flat and richly supplied with rivers capable of canalisation. But our existing canals could be made far more valuable in the public service, and certain new canals might with advantage be constructed. Under a proper organisation of our inland transport facilities, the canals could play a much more useful part in carrying very bulky, non-perishable goods, where speed of delivery is not essential, and relieving the railways of some portion of this burden.Among canals which have been suggested are one between the Firths of Forth and Clyde, and a new North-South canal from the East Midlands to London, via Nottingham, Leicester and Northampton. These and other projects for canals should be carefully considered by the Board, and put forward for adoption where approved.(v) Ports and Harbours.A number of schemes have been prepared by bodies interested for valuable improvements and extensions in both our principal and secondary ports. In many cases work of real utility and economic profit could be carried out, if financial credit is provided, and an effort should be made to set on foot approved works of this nature.Of recent years the once busy small coastal shipping around our island has fallen into decay, and many little harbours served by it are in bad condition. It was natural that as improved facilities for land transport grew up, they would rapidly challenge the slow and uncertain conveyance of goods around the coast by small schooners and brigantines, dependent on wind and weather. But the more recent introduction of the oil-driven auxiliary Diesel engine into sea-going barges makes coastal traffic once more a practical proposition. To enable it to resume active functioning, a good deal should be done to improve our ports and harbours; and in this direction the Board will find a profitable outlet for capital expenditure, and a source of employment for a good deal of labour.(b) Telephones.Warmest praise is due to Sir Kingsley Wood for the bold new policy he has recently inaugurated of telephone development. The reduction in the telephone charges is being reflected by a record influx of new subscribers, and all kinds of new records in the volume of telephone use. As a consequence, new plant has had to be installed, new cables laid, and new exchange equipment provided.
The modernisation of our telephone system is now rapidly going ahead, and the surplus proceeds which the Post Office is beginning to accumulate show that this expansion is paying its way. The introduction of the modern system of automatic controls for rural telephone services is making it possible for telephones to be extended rapidly throughout our rural districts.These gratifying results of the Postmaster-General&apos;s forward policy confirm the view that there has for long been a considerable potential demand in this country for very much more extensive telephone services; and we recommend that the admirable advances recently made shall be given every encouragement and financial assistance to continue and to extend yet further. But we have a long way yet to go before we are in this respect abreast of many other countries. At present we are only ninth in the list of telephone-using countries in respect of the number of telephones per thousand of population, being surpassed not only by the United States and our own Dominions, but by Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland.In particular, we urge that vigorous efforts should be made to increase very extensively the telephone service in rural districts. In this connection we recommend a bold revision downwards of the present scale of charges, which is often quite prohibitive to would-be subscribers. The recent experiment with a low flat-rate charge for night trunk calls has proved that cheapened telephone rates are highly remunerative: and it is suggested that the Post Office should set before itself the aim of approximating the telephone service to the postal and telegraph system by a uniform flat rate for distance calls and by making a standard charge for installation and rental, irrespective of a subscribers distance from his exchange. Unless this last reform is adopted, there can be little hope of a general use of the telephone by farmers.(c) Goal.After Agriculture, coal is the greatest of our national industries. It is also at present one of the most depressed. The unemployed in the coal mining industry number over a quarter of a million, and the mining areas of the country are the districts where distress is most acute and general.There seems at present little immediate prospect of our regaining any large part of the great export trade in coal we formerly enjoyed. But it is clear that, whether our purpose be to aim at such an increase, or merely to keep what we still have, we must take every step to ensure that this great industry is run as efficiently as possible in the national interest.It is thoroughly well known to-day that the coal industry is very far from being conducted with maximum efficiency. Plans for its reform have long been familiar. It is high time that they were carried out.To achieve the reconstruction of the industry, considerable capital investment will be necessary. But the financial plight of the industry, particularly in South Wales, is such that private investment cannot be relied on to make this reconstruction possible. The community must step in, and undertake responsibility for reorganising the machinery for dealing with its great natural wealth of coal.We therefore propose : (i) The nationalisation of all mining royalties, at a fair valuation.(ii) The establishment of regional  corporations or  StatutoryBoards to control the whole of the coal industry in each main producing area, where it is deemed desirable in the national interest.(iii) The reorganisation of the industry in each of such areas onan economically sound productive basis as one unit, concentrating production upon the most economic pits, and with approved underground amalgamation.(iv) The more vigorous examination of the scientific utilisation ofcoal and of its by-products.
(v) The revision of railway charges in order to enable coal toenter the export market at a more competitive price. At present the railway rates amount to about 25 per cent, of the f.o.b. costs of small coal from South Wales.(vi) The achievement of greater economy in coal transport by the pooling of wagons.The National Development Board would, of course, co-operate actively with the Mines Department and the Coal Mines Reorganisa-tion Commission, and the latter should, if necessary, be equipped with wider statutory powers to discharge its task more rapidly.(d) Electricity.As regards the distribution of light and power in the economical form of electricity, we are far behind many countries on the Continent. Even a comparatively non-industrial country Tike Spain furnishes electric light to the smallest country cottages.We have already the machinery of the Electricity Commissioners and the Central Electricity Board with which to carry out the full developments of electrical supply. But we must make it a clearly defined item of our national policy that the extension of electrical supply shall be pressed forward unrestingly throughout the whole countryside. A great deal more could be done than has yet been accomplished to expedite electrical distribution. Such work would make a valuable contribution, alike to the increase of employment and to raising the national standard of comfort and amenity. Where lack of finance is responsible for delay, the National Development Board must be prepared to come to the help of well-planned schemes for extending our electrical services.Practical schemes for the electrification of suburban railway lines, which could be put in hand forthwith on the lines recommended by the Weir Committee, have been estimated to be capable of utilising a total capital expenditure of  80 million to  100 million.There are also in England and Wales about 30,000 square miles with an average density of 123 persons per square mile, in which electricity is not available. Assuming this area developed at  600 per square mile, an expenditure of  18 million would be required. In addition to this, a further  12 million could probably be usefully spent in further developing areas where a partial supply is now available. This would automatically involve a good deal of additional work on generating stations, &amp;c.While main grid supply has now been organised on a national basis with remarkable success, distribution is still chaotic,&apos; irregular, and frequently unsatisfactory. There would appear a strong case for proceeding to organise a unified system of the retail distribution of electricity a step forward which would bring the great advantage of enabling the nation&apos;s electrical service, like its postal service, to introduce a uniform charge throughout the country. The advantage of this in permitting development of areas now backward, and assisting agriculture, needs no explanation.chapter VIII. Industrial Development.(a) Iron and Steel.The British Iron and Steel Industry forms, along with coal, the foundation of our British manufacturing industries. Like coal, too, it is at present in the main in deep depression, with nearly a quarter of its workers unemployed. Despite the fact that it was given the protection of a tariff thereby imposing a price handicap upon the great British industries which use iron and steel it has as yet failed with a few exceptions to modernise its equipment and reorganise itself effectively. A great deal of the existing plant in the British steel industry is out-of-date or uneconomic in size. Economical methods of production are often neglected. The whole industry badly needs overhauling and rationalising in the interests of efficiency. I welcome the appointment of Sir Andrew Duncan at the head of the
Federation of Steel Manufacturers: and the National Board should do all in its power to assist him in overhauling and rationalising the Iron and Steel industry.Here, as with coal, financial stringency has doubtless combined with lethargic administration to hold up progress. The interests of national industry demand that this situation shall be tackled without delay. The section of the National Development Board which applies itself to industrial issues must set up an Iron and Steel Board which will take control of the industry and plan its policy. This Board will have to decide on the best places to locate modern iron and steel plants; on the extent to which existing out-of-date plant should be scrapped, and new, large-scale blast furnaces of a more efficient pattern erected. There is serious need for the provision of fresh capital, if the industry is really to be placed upon an efficient footing, and this the National Board will have to furnish. With our abundant native supplies of coal and iron ore, we ought to be able to do more than hold our own in the world steel market, and a cheapening of the home produced articles by more efficient methods of production would be an immense benefit to our tinplate industry, our engineering works and to the metal trades generally.(b) Cotton and Textiles.Cotton is by far our greatest export industry, and it has therefore felt more keenly than any other British manufacturing industry the growth of restrictions upon international trade and exchange, and the rising tide of competition from other countries which have gone in for textile manufacture. It has also suffered from internal troubles; from the flood of over-capitalisation which took place after the war; from a lack of flexibility in adapting its patterns and fabrics to changing tastes in its foreign markets, and to countering the competition of its rivals; and from a persistent reluctance to adopt the most modern and economical processes and labour-saving devices.-Since our biggest markets for cotton goods are the tropical and sub-tropical countries from which we import a number of primary products and raw materials not produced in this country, it should be possible for us to increase our sales to them if our industry is efficiently rationalised and learns to adapt its product in price and quality to the conditions of those countries. I have already mentioned the need for an alteration of monetary policy as a means of expanding the Indian market for cotton goods.Here, again, there is need for a controlling authority repre-sentative of the cotton industry, to co-ordinate its efforts and to provide the necessary finance for its re-equipment. The industrial branch of the National Development Board must take this matter in hand, and establish a suitable controlling authority for the cotton trade.(c) Shipbuilding and Shipping.Our maritime industry is the basis of our world commerce. Its importance to the nation is fundamental because of our dependence on imports for our food and raw materials. The subsidising of the new Cunarder illustrates the value which official quarters recognise it to possess.The competition of subsidised shipping of other nations, the discriminative legislation some of them have adopted to secure preference to the merchantmen carrying their flag, and the general slump in international commerce, have combined to hit our shipping industry very hard. Unemployment in shipbuilding is higher than in any other industry, and is also very high in shipping itself and in our docks and harbours.To meet this situation it is essential that the British shipping industry shall be conducted on lines of maximum efficiency. Here, too, such a policy involves a scrapping of uneconomic ships, and the renewing of a proportion of our mercantile marine, for which the necessary capital can hardly be provided by the industry itself. The National Development Board will have to take action in this case also to render possible the necessary measures of industrial reconstruction.
(d) Neiv Industries.The fertility of modern invention and the commercial application of new scientific discoveries are constantly leading to the rise of fresh industries which contribute much to the well-being and amenity of the world. It will be the task of the Board to see that when such industries arise, they are encouraged to establish themselves in districts where they will best contribute to reducing our unemploy-ment problem, and it should be prepared to further this process by assisting them on approved lines to obtain the capital they will require for setting up their works.The present tendency of new industries to establish themselves in the south of the country, leaving the derelict areas further north without any hope of sharing in the new employment which is thus created, may be good business from the point of view of the individual firm, which has a natural preference for locating where rates are low. But it is bad business for the nation, faced with the responsibility for derelict areas crowded with unemployed. It should be the part of sane national policy to secure that new industrial developments are directed to the neighbourhoods where they will best serve our social economy.Chapter IX. Opening a Boad to the Land.But among the various spheres to which a national Development Board will direct its attention, as a means of finding not only temporary employment during an exceptional period of trade depression, but permanent employment for our surplus population, first place must be given to the land.The importance of the land for any scheme to deal permanently with the unemployed has been repeatedly&apos; recognised by successive Governments and by various independent bodies which have-considered this problem. Perhaps the most striking, because most recent, is the evidence contained in the findings of the Commissioners appointed by the Government to investigate industrial conditions in the Depressed Areas. Every one of these Commissioners has stressed the importance of Land Development and Land Settlement as a means of dealing with the industrial distress. From their statements on this issue the following passages may be quoted : Bt. Hon. J. C. C. Davidson, M.P., says in the covering letter.to-his Bepdrt: &apos;&apos; Perhaps the recommendation to which I attach the greatest importance deals with land settlement.&quot; In the Summary of his conclusions he declares &apos;&apos; Agriculture does appear to offer possibilities given the right conditions,&quot; and recommends &quot; That a Development Trust Company (or Companies) should be formed to promote Agricultural and Horticultural Schemes.&quot;Captain D. Euan Wallace, M.P.&apos;s, views are cited on page 45.Sir Wyndham (now Lord) Portal states with regard to South Wales : &quot;I found that in every district there is a great desire for men to have the opportunity of obtaining small holdings and of being transferred to a district suitable for this form of agriculture.....There are numbers of men out of work as miners, who were originally agricultural labourers and would soon pick up work on the land again,&apos;&apos; and recommends &apos;&apos; That the Distressed Areas have prior place in the question of Land Settlement.&quot;Sir Arthur Bose advocates both Land Beclamation and Land Improvement as offering a considerable field for the employment of labour. As regards land utilisation, he says that &quot;There has existed in Scotland for many generations a demand for settlement on the land in various ways, and this demand has never been satisfied.&quot; He remarks, with regard to a recent scheme of land settlement, that &apos;&apos; The results so far obtained are most encouraging and the system may be said definitely to have passed the experimental stage.&quot;The quality of our soil will challenge comparison with that of any other country in Europe. We have a higher proportion of first-class land than is possessed by countries such as Denmark, Holland or Germany, who all support a large and thriving agricultural population.
Our farms are nearer than those of any other country, with the exception of Belgium, to the demand provided by dense aggregates of urban population who must be fed.Yet, in spite of all these advantages, the industry of agriculture is more neglected in Great,Britain than in any other country comparable with us; the proportion of the population gaining a livelihood from agriculture is far lower; the numbers employed per square mile of cultivable land is also lower; and there are large areas of potentially fertile soil which are seriously under-cultivated or completely derelict. Although certain branches of agricultural production have developed rapidly in recent years, e.g., poultry, eggs, fruit and vegetables, there is still ample scope for an increased output of food products from the soil.In Belgium, over 19 per cent, of the occupied population gain their living by agriculture; in Holland, 206 per cent.; in Germany,, 305 per cent.; in Denmark, 34-8 per cent.; in France, 38-3 per cent. The proportion in England and Wales is about 7 per cent.The occupied population of Britain who gain their living by agri-culture number 1,300,000 in all. The numbers in France are 8,200,000 and in Germany 9,800,000. In Britain there are less than 14 persons for each square mile of our land area. The proportion in Denmark is over 34 per square mile ; in Holland, over 51; in Germany and Belgium, nearly 54. It is not suggested that it would be possible or even economically desirable to aim at settling as large a number of workers on British soil as in most of these countries. But the diver-gence between the numbers of their peasantry and ours is much too great and it ought to and can be considerably narrowed. Were we even to double our agricultural population, we should still have a sparser distribution and a smaller proportion of our nation engaged in agriculture than Belgium, the most industrialised nation on the Continent of Europe, which has a denser total population to the square mile than England and Wales. An increase from 7 to 10 per cent, of men and women engaged in the cultivation of the land would add about half a million to our agricultural workers of all kinds. Ancillary industries would add another half-million. So far from employing more workers on the soil the drift is, and has been for over half a century, steadily the other way and it still continues. Since the War over 200,000 workers have left the land half of them since 1927.So far as a market for increased output from our soil is concerned, we are to-day buying from abroad not far short of  200 million worth of food-stuffs of kinds which can be grown profitably in this country, even when all cereals and sugar are excluded from the reckoning. Of raw wool, raw hides, timber and wood pulp again of kinds- that can be produced here we import nearly  80 million worth. Altogether we import at the present exceptionally low prices nearly  270 million worth of agricultural products of kinds which could be grown and prepared for the market at home. At the prices of 1929, their value would be about  400 million. It is clear, therefore, that even at present there is room in the market for an immense increase of goods from British soil.It is not, of course, suggested that within a short space of time all these supplies could be raised at home or that all of them could ultimately be raised. It takes decades, for example, to produce supplies of timber. It is true that Professor Stapledon&apos;s discoveries as to the possibility of improving grasses demonstrate that we can treble our sheep population on the poorest soils. Nevertheless, the demands for wool probably far exceed any sheep population we could maintain here in view of the competing demands for the use of our available land. But with so large a market, there is scant excuse for leaving our hills denuded of forests which might be growing there, and am upland pastures bare of sheep they could be made to carry.Indeed, the real demand is even greater than these figures indicate. The measure of our present consumption is far from being the limit of our potential market. Many people here are underfed to-day, judged by every accepted standard of sufficient nourishment to sustain health and strength. The unemployed and the less well-paid wage earners could all with advantage increase very considerably their consumption of food-stuffs. So they could of boot leather and woollen clothing. If they were all profitably employed and the country itaelf were prospering as it would do if its millions of workless
had been turned from a liability into an asset, there would be a very marked increase in the food consumption of the country and in the capacity of the public to pay for good fresh, home-grown produce. The increase would come mainly in the products where we can on merits beat all our competitors. They have the additional advantage that they employ far more labour than cereals.The practical problems involved will be discussed further on. At this point it is enough to say that if sensible and energetic measures can be adopted to increase the efficiency of our agriculture, improve the fertility of under-cultivated land, reclaim the considerable areas of land now derelict which could be used for cultivation, improved pasturage or afforestation, and to organise efficiently the marketing and advertising of home-grown produce, we should be able to retain a very much larger proportion of our population on the soil, as farmers, small holders and land workers, and at the same time increase very much the employment in the important trades and industries ancillary to agriculture. It has been always accepted that for every man employed in cultivation of the soil the fruit of his labours provides work for another man outside.The case for this is, of course, immensely stronger when one bears in mind the increase in human health and happiness which would be achieved by a progressive shifting of population from the overcrowded heart of industrial cities to the fresh air and living beauty of the countryside. As was demonstrated during the war, the sturdiest and fittest part of a country&apos;s population is bred on the soil. The balance of town and country in Great Britain needs a radical readjustment. But even if one ignores these vitally important considerations, it is still evident as a business proposition that the potentialities of land development are quite the biggest of our resources in seeking a solution of our unemployment problem.It is very remarkable that each of the Commissioners appointed by the Government to enquire into the depressed areas has come separately to this conclusion. It is expressed by Mr. Euan Wallace, the Commissioner for the North-Eastern area, in these words :-. &apos;&apos; No comprehensive survey of the condition of the Durham coal-field can avoid the conclusion that the ultimate destiny of a large part of the country, now industrialised, must be to return to agriculture .... it becomes more than ever apparent that, unless the land can be made to support a larger population, many of those who would normally have been attached to the coal-mining industry will be condemned to a permanent state ofpauperisation.....    There is, therefore, ample scope for amore intensive use of the existing agricultural land,&quot; and he recommends &quot; A land settlement scheme, on the lines at present in operation under the Durham County Council, to be financed by the Exchequer.&quot;The National Development Board will, in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture, have to set up a special subsidiary Commis-sion or Board of land development to concentrate on this part of the front.Such a land development Board will bring under review the possibilities of land utilisation for agricultural production, afforestation-tion, parks, open spaces and recreation. They will also co-operate with the Ministry of Health in all schemes for urban and industrial development in the country for purposes of housing, factories, exploitation of minerals, development of railways, highways, airways, water supply and all other uses which call for regional planning.1. Survey.In connection with the above, it is fundamental to any proper plan for the development of our resources of land that it should be based on accurate knowledge of the character and possibilities of each area. So the initial stage of the activities of the Land Develop-ment Board must be the carrying out of a survey or series of surveys which will eventually cover the whole country.The 6-inch Maps of the Ordnance Survey, of course, already form the basis of a detailed survey, and with the addition of but [11313] b 2
little more information they oould be made of altogether greater usefulness. Rough land of different types is shown by two or more conventions. When the Maps are being revised it will be a very simple matter for these areas of rough land to be categorised into main types. Such as, for example, bracken, heather, and the major kinds of rough grass. It would only be necessary to have a small staff of Botanists attached to the Survey Department at Southampton. In a similar manner the various types of woodland could easily be categorised in conformity with a single schedule that could be drawn up in consultation with the Forestry Commission. A somewhat more detailed categorisation would also be valuable in connection with urban and suburban areas. I welcome the splendid enterprise of Dr. Dudley Stamp and the London School of Economics in preparing a series of land utilisation maps for England and Wales.This by no means implies that nothing practical can be done until investigations covering months or years have been carried out in every corner of the Kingdom. The work of survey will be a continuous function of the Board, and it may expect to get considerable help for its task through the co-operation of existing bodies the Agricultural Departments of Universities; County Agricultural Committees and their advisers; Land Valuation Offices; Town Planning and Regional Planning Committees. Here and there it will be found that partial surveys of certain areas already exist. And by using the services of experts who have already had practice in this kind of work, it would be possible in a very short time to effect a survey of certain areas, such as those bordering on regions where unemployment is particularly acute, and to initiate forthwith in these areas certain measures of practical utility, such as reclamation, drainage, reconditioning of land and buildings, afforestation, improvement of grass land, destruction of bracken, provision of water supply, electrification, making up of rural roads and establishment of family farms, cottages, holdings, allotments and agricultural training settlements. For the purpose of urban development, a considerable body of information is already in existence as a result of the work of Regional Planning Committees; and there are also on record quite a number of projects put forward by them for improvement schemes, which the Board could bring-under review and recommend, if it approved them, to the National Development. Board for financial backing.Insistence on the need for survey, therefore, as a preliminary to a proper planning of land development, does not imply any serious delay in getting to grips with our problem. But it is impossible to make sound plans for a frugal use of our land except on the basis of accurate information as to its quality and potentialities. While to save time a start might be made ad hoc with a survey of districts chosen arbitrarily on the basis of information already possessed as to their undeveloped possibilities, or on account of their proximity to depressed areas, the survey must be systematically developed to cover the whole country, and must be kept up to date when complete.2. Agricultural Programme.As the survey of the agricultural land in the Kingdom proceeds, it will become evident what works must be undertaken to secure the fullest utilisation of our soil. Arrangements will forthwith be made to put these works in hand.Among the schemes which will have to be carried out may be mentioned : -(i) Reclamation.Scattered round the British countryside in every part of England, Scotland and Wales are thousands of acres of potentially fertile ground which are at present waste and derelict. One example, amongst a great many others elsewhere, was given in one county of 2,500 acres of undrained swamp, which, if drained and reclaimed, would be 2,500 acres of rich black soil. Most counties have similar waste areas, some smaller, some far larger, which could be reclaimed. There are also, especially in coastal districts, great stretches of light
sandy soil, at present worthless, which would certainly have been put under partial cultivation if they were in Holland instead of Britain.There are also in the uplands large areas growing only bracken and other coarse forms of herbage and brush, which could be turned into profitable grazing land by a proper application of scientific grass-land treatment. Other such areas could be afforested. Afforestation and pasture improvement should, however, be very carefully co-ordinated.At present all this land, amounting in the aggregate to hundreds of thousands of acres, is rendering hardly any service to the nation. In the name of common sense we ought to employ some of our work-less in making it fit for use. As a result of recent research and experiment, possibilities are being opened up of a much more productive use of this land, and every means should be employed to ensure that the fullest advantage is taken of them.(ii) Reconditioning.Agricultural land and buildings have seriously deteriorated since the war. Heavy taxation has impoverished rural landlords, who formerly supplied money for capital improvements. A great deal of the land at present under cultivation could be made far more fertile by improvements works, including Land Drainage, Liming, Fertilizers, and so forth.Perhaps the most urgent and immediate needs of much agricultural land are proper drainage, the rectifying of the serious deficiency of lime which occurs in every part of the country, and also the providing or safeguarding of adequate supplies of phosphatic and other fertilisers, and suitable seeds. The capital stage of this expenditure terminates when this neglected land has been brought into &quot; good heart&quot; and fit for the ordinary routine of cultivation.(a) Land Drainage.We realise that Catchment Boards are doing what they can within the limited means at their disposal, but greater detailed application is required to the agricultural needs of the districts concerned in order to : (1) Begulate the -flow of rivers to stop flooding, open up natural outlets, and establish pumping stations. It has been estimated by expert authority that an expenditure of  30 millions is urgently called for in this direction.(2) Becondition existent water courses.(3) Thoroughly utilise mechanical methods of improved drainage, e.g., mole drainage.Land is going out of cultivation in every part of the country owing to lack of drainage and of protection against the over-flow of rivers. Financial assistance on a liberal scale is essential not only if the waterlogged land is to be reclaimed, but if further damage is to be averted. There is room here for the employment of scores of thousands on urgent work which will well repay the investment of national capital.(b) Liming.For the past half-century liming has fallen into disuse, owing to a common fallacy that chemical fertilisers could not only supplement, but actually supplant it. This is not the case, and in many districts all over the country one of the first acts for improvement and reclamation should be to remedy lime deficiencies wherever they occur.The direct influence of Lime on the quality of the grass con-sidered as a feeding stuff is also of great importance. Now that the value of pure milk of high quality is becoming to be properly xecognised there can be no justification on the grounds of human health for producing milk from pastures on soils with an exaggerated deficiency in Lime.Lime supplies, in all their different forms, should therefore be organised and developed from the quarry, the kiln, the pulverizer, and the chemical works, and, where necessary, processed to put them in the most satisfactory form for transportation and application.
(c) Phosphates and Fertilizers.Inorganic nitrogen supplies for securing fertility may be regarded as safe, but the same remark does not apply to phosphatic manures. Further, the necessity for the abundant use of phosphates increases as the land is gradually reconditioned and reclaimed. In view of the fact that basic slag is a bye-product, and its supplies therefore limited, consideration should be- given to the more extended supply, distribution and utilisation of ground rock phosphates. Further, it is suggested that it should be practicable to use the limited supplies of basic slag to the best advantage, by mixing with them a proportion of ground rock phosphate.   This was done during the war.It is not suggested that the Land Development Board should concern itself with the provision of fertilizers for ordinary cropping purposes. That is naturally within the province of cultivators themselves. But in the course of reconditioning neglected and under-cultivated land it may well prove necessary to apply phosphates as a means of getting it once more into good heart, and the foregoing reference to them is based on this assumption.(d) Farm Seeds.In connection with any scheme of reclamation and improvement it is particularly necessary to safeguard supplies of the recently introduced leafy and persistent strains of grasses and clovers. Here it is necessary to anticipate requirements and to make provision for them beforehand. This would necessitate the setting up of ad hoc seed production farms, which would be intensively managed and would therefore provide considerable employment.Financial credit on the lowest possible terms should be given in order to carry through these essential operations (6), (c), (d).(e) Farm Buildings.One of the most serious needs of agriculture to-dajr is a -programme on a large scale for the repair of farm buildings or their replacement to suit modern standards of efficiency and cleanliness; this is particularly the case with dairy and poultry farms and piggeries. Until this condition of things is set right, the production of pure milk and best quality meat will be unattainable.It is also true that the advances which have been made possible by agricultural science, live-stock improvement and machinery are largely nullified in practice through the absence of suitable buildings and equipment. This inadequacy is also noticeable in the design and lay-out of farm buildings and the general lack of convenience both for the production and disposal of produce. The water supply to farm buildings and fields is often defective or totally lacking.The nation ought not to allow its land to fall into this state of neglect. It must put in hand an extensive programme for the reconditioning and better equipment of its agricultural holdings.(iii) Farming Finance.The deterioration of British farm land and buildings very marked since the War is very often due to lack of capital on the part of the farmer or land owner.In the matter of capital, the agricultural industry labours under a heavy disadvantage as compared with other industries. The whole machinery of investment in this country is adapted to the financing of manufacturing and commercial concerns, but not of agriculture. Any small investor can put a few pounds into coal mines or steel works, into drapery shares, cinemas, or greyhound racing. He can even support cultivation in other lands by buying tea and rubber shares. But there is no machinery whereby he can buy shares in British agriculture.In consequence, unless farmers are independently wealthy, they have not the capital available for large expenditure on their land. Farming is a chancy business, more than other industries at the mercy of the weather and the unpredictable success or failure of crops elsewhere; and it has a slow turnover. So a man with limited capital tends to keep as much as he can of it in live and dead stock, and to put only the minimum into his soil. This is why in so many farms worth-while improvements are left undone, and why so often the land is allowed slowly to deteriorate.
The State must bring its ample financial resources to the help of agriculture. It must organise a great reclamation, reconditioning and improvement campaign, and itself see to the carrying out of the work. Many owners will doubtless welcome such assistance, which the State could render them at a very low yearly charge for interest and amortisation, since it can borrow the money more cheaply than any private person. There must of course be some provision against raising rents above the additional charges attributable to the loans by the State. Where the expense of necessary reconditioning is such that the landowner refuses to be responsible for it, the State must be prepared to step in and take over the land at a fair value as a preliminary to putting it in order.Re-equipping the Countryside.- In addition to the work of reclamation and reconditioning, the Land Development Board will also be able to employ a good deal of labour in developing the amenities of the countryside so that it may offer an attractive and comfortable livelihood to a bigger population.Many of the small country roads giving access to farms are in a deplorable state of disrepair. This handicaps the transport of seeds, lime, fertilisers and farm machinery to the farms, and the transport of goods off the farms to market. Children from the homes in these areas reach school mired and soaked. Farm workers find it difficult of an evening to get to the nearest village or town. If the land is to attract and retain its population, and farming is to be efficiently conducted, a great deal must be done, especially in some districts, to improve these farm roads. Many of them have never been taken over by the local Highway Authority, and where their improvement adds considerably to the value of the farms to which they lead, it would be reasonable to recover the cost or a proportion of it from the owner.Rural Housing is in need of serious attention. The existing cottages require reconditioning in many cases, and there is room for a big programme of further building of cottages in the countryside. A bold scheme to erect at least 100,000 additional cottages for agricultural workers should be taken in hand at once by the Land Development Board. When a larger population is attracted to the land by these development schemes, then the housing problem in the countryside will reach far more considerable dimensions.Rural Water Supply is also in a very unsatisfactory state. While large-scale schemes of water conservation and distribution fall within the province of regional planning, a great deal could be done to secure a water supply for villages and farms which at present have none, if energetic efforts were coupled with a certain elasticity of method and a sympathetic financial attitude.Rural Amenities. As our big urban areas increase there is a growing tendency for those living in these deserts of brick and mortar to seek the countryside in their free time and holidays. They pour out into it as hikers, cyclists, motorists, earavanners. We ought to encourage this rural-mindedness. In certain natural play-grounds of comparatively little agricultural value, such as Snowdonia, the Lake District, and the Highlands, not only of Scotland and Wales, but of Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Lancashire and Devonshire, national parks should be developed with attractive facilities for the visitor and tourist. The improvement of rural roads, already mentioned, will also aid this tendency by making it easier for people on holiday to go and stay on a farm.(v) Rural Industries.Good work is at present being done by voluntary movements with a meagre capital to stimulate the development of rural industries. These are of the greatest importance for securing a profitable livelihood to those who live on the land, and especially to provide work in the vicinity of their homes for the young women of the rural areas. In many of its branches, agriculture is highly seasonal, and not really a full time job all the year round. Home crafts and local industries to which land workers and their families can turn during the slack seasons of agriculture, or which broader
the interests and employment possibilities in the villages generally, would play a valuable part in maintaining a nourishing rural population. Further, they can help to make agriculture more profitable by carrying out the processing of its products for the market and the utilisation of its bye-products. Among important food processing can be named bacon-curing, cheese and butter manufacture, canning, jam-making. The bye-products of the dairying industry could be utilised for such purposes as casein products, for which a large range of uses are now available. Hurdles, brushes, basket-work, peat cutting, are among other small-scale industries which turn to profit the otherwise waste products of the countryside. The Land Development Board would have to consider carefully what can wisely be done to encourage and extend the development and extension alike of the industries ancillary to agriculture in the countryside, and of the various kinds of workshop and small factory industries which are economically adaptable to village practice to-day, in the light of the modern improvement of road transport facilities and the extension of electrical supply.(vi) Land Settlement.As waste land is reclaimed and land at present under-cultivated brought into a high state of efficiency and adequately equipped with buildings, access roads, water, &amp;c, the British countryside will be able to support a much larger agricultural population. How is this to be provided, and settled on the land?Something, no doubt, will be achieved if we can keep on the soil those who grow up on it year by year, instead of letting them drift away into the cities because the country offers them neither employ-ment nor house-room in the village. But if we are to solve our unemployment problem, and readjust the balance of town and country, we must act swiftly and aim at a direct and immediate transference of population. There are many thousands of men now numbered among the industrial unemployed who grew up on the land and have not forgotten its crafts. There are many scores of thousands of young fellows by no means too old to be trained for agriculture.The Ministry of Agricuture&apos;s annual returns of the number of workers employed on agricultural holdings show that in Great Britain their total declined between 1921 and 1934 by 196,281. It.has gone down nearly 100,000 since 1927. A high proportion of these former agricultural workers must have sought other work, and doubtless a number of them are at present unemployed. Renewed prosperity in agriculture would attract them back to farm work and these figures also indicate that there is better employment in agriculture when urban industry is more prosperous.How can more workers, find employment in and around the land? I look for an increase in the rural employment in several directions : 1. If waste land is reclaimed, if farms are reconditioned, buildings and soil are thereby made more productive, if marketing is thoroughly organised, so as to enable the cultivator to dispose of his produce at a good price, if the purchasing capacity of the community is raised, so as to increase the demand for agricultural produce, if the cultivator is given fair treatment in comparison with other industries, if adequate capital is put into cultivation, then many more workers will be required on existing holdings and better wages can be paid. A well-equipped farm with the requisite capital to run it and market facilities will -employ many more workers than a neglected under-capitalised holding. Most workers will always prefer working for a steady wage to taking the risk of running a business on their own in small holdings or otherwise.2. The creation of small holdings, including family farms, market gardens and poultry farms.3. An accession of workers to the villages for ancillary trade and industries.4.   Rural industries, not directly connected with agriculture.5.   The afforestation of areas unsuitable for tillage or pasture.6. The improvement in rural amenities and conveniences: attract-ing the town population, either to live in the country permanently orr even more, to pay periodical visits in holidays. ...
Some-of-these processes would take longer to operate than others, but the work of reconditioning, drainage, afforestation, preparing and rebuilding would in a very short time employ a considerable number of additional workers, and once agriculture were put on. a better business footing the demand for additional farm hands would increase very rapidly. Small holdings would naturally take more time, but ae the years went on the rate of increase would accelerate.We propose, therefore, that a survey should be immediately taken of the land available and suitable for agricultural settlement in each county, also of the workers who are available and suitable by experience or by training to be employed in any scheme of settlement either as independent holders or as workers on land owned or managed by others. Training centres should be set up at once in every part of the country to give those who desire a career on the land the necessary skill for this task.To assist the Land Development Board in carrying out these projects, advisory Regional Committees will be set up to submit plans for land development in their respective areas. These schemes would provide for reclamation, reconditioning of land and buildings, for settlement of smallholdings, cottage holdings and allotments. Provision would have to be made for acquiring the necessary land, either by purchase or lease. There should also be included in these schemes the building of cottages for rural workers.Active steps should be taken without delay to settle on suitable smallholdings the registered applicants already on the waiting list of County Councils. These number upwards of 5,000. Were it known that an ample supply of holdings would be available, the number of these applicants would swiftly be very materially increased.The registered applicants for statutory small holdings are in nearly all cases men with a considerable agricultural experience. But to carry out land settlement on a big scale, we must also draw in men who at present have no, or only a partial, experience of agricultural methods.The satisfactory results achieved by past schemes of land settle-ment are more than sufficient to justify the extension of this process. The report of a very careful investigation recently carried out states: -&quot; Of the 300 tenants interviewed, over 90 per cent, had been on the holdings since their establishment, and 35 per cent, of the holdings in question were established between 1908 and 1918. 50 per cent, from 1919 to 1926, and 15 per cent, from 1927 to 1932. All these tenants may be regarded as making a reasonable living, and many were considerably better off than when they started.....&quot; The cases of failure discovered were almost negligible, and out of the 300 holdings visited, only seven cases of failure were traced, and the cause was generally the unsuitability of the tenant.&apos;&apos; The type of tenant is probably the most important factor influencing success or failure. In this connection, of the 300 tenants interviewed, the most successful were those who possessed little agricultural experience when they took over the holding, and had an open mind. In such a case, more specialised farming-was invariably the result. The least successful tenants appeared to be those who had previously worked on a large farm without the responsibility of management.&quot;Accordingly, it is proposed that community training settlements shall be set up to which young men shall be recruited from the ranks of the unemployed. In these settlements the young men will be trained in up-to-date methods of land cultivation in all its branches, including crop production, market gardening, animal husbandry, afforestation, &amp;c, and particularly with a view to the running of small holdings and family farms. Similar training-will be established for young women, which might concentrate rather on poultry keeping, horticulture and dairying.^ As far as possible, the provision of land for independent holders might take the form of community small holding settlements, in [11313] P
which a group of small holders would be associated together, with a co-operative centre in charge of a competent manager, through which all their requirements would be purchased and all their produce marketed. The community centre would possess farm machinery for use by all the small holders in the group, and would also undertake on behalf of them all such services as grading of produce, incubation of eggs, &amp;c. Working capital for the holders so settled would also have.to be provided.In a number of cases these community centres might be associated with demonstration holdings. In addition, there is a real need for large experimental demonstration farms in suitable areas, which would expore the possibilities of improved agricultural methods and place the results at the disposal of the agricultural community.Some trainees might prefer employment on holdings not their own. To ensure that such a prospect should not be too unattractive to people familiar with the level of wages earned in industrial occupations, it is essential that the land worker shall share&quot; in the agricultural prosperity produced by the proposed investment of public money in this industry, alike in his status, prospects and wages. When an unemployed person is settled on a holding it might be desirable to continue his allowance for the few months that must elapse before he begins to reap the fruit of his labours.The aim ought to be in course of years to settle an additional 500,000 on the land either on family farms, market gardens or poultry runs. This can be achieved provided there is an effective system organised for marketing the produce, and for commanding the products of our soil to British and even overseas consumers.(vii) Marketing.This programme of land reconditioning and settlement raises the crucial issue of the profit obtainable by the agricultural producer. Can farming pay? It is useless to think of settling more people on the land unless there is an assured market for their produce at a price which will give them a profit on their expenditure and labour, and a reasonable standard of living.It might well seem amazing that such a question should arise; that in a country which cannot produce anything like enough fo^od for its population, those engaged in producing food the most utterly indispensable of all our necessities should be in doubt about their market and their remuneration. But for some of our food require-ments this country draws upon the surplus available throughout the world, grown in countries with certain advantages of production and sometimes with a low standard of living. Further, certain of the imported food-stuffs which compete with the produce of the home farmer are subsidised by their country of origin and dumped upon us below a true market price.Moreover, although the British farmer is nearer to his market than most of his overseas competitors, the need for a greater measure of organisation of the preparation, grading, packing, bulk transport and marketing of his produce is imperative if he is to compete successfully with the regular flow of select products of standard quality coming from abroad.In considering the actual marketed output of agriculture, the following points must be noted : The market itself is large enough already for any production which even double our present agricultural population might achieve. As already stated, we import, in addition to sugar and cereals, nearly 200 million pounds&apos; worth (at present low prices) of food-stuffs of kinds which could be grown here, and our present total food consumption, is by no means the. limit of our potential food market. A rise in prosperity, which puts more money into the pockets of the poorer households, would show itself at once in increased food consumption.It has been shown by the Social Survey of the Merseyside. Area that a considerable number of the families one in six of those sampled were unable to spend on food even the bare minimum weekly sum which the Committee of the British Medical Association has laid down, as the smallest cost at which life can be adequately sustained. -Particularly was this found to be the case in families with
several children. For a family with three children the Merseyside standard for expenditure on food falls below that of the British. Medical Association by 7s. 5d. a week,; where there; are 5 children, by lOs. 3d. a week.. Some.23 per cent, of all the children sampled on Merseyside under 14 were found to be suffering from lack of food or other necessaries of life. It is clear, therefore, that an increase in the spending power of the poorer classes of the nation which brought them no further than the poverty line, proposed as a minimum by the British Medical Association, would result in a vast increase in the national expenditure on food-stuffs. Any further advance in purchasing power would still more increase our national food consumption, with incalculable benefit to our health and physique.It may be added that if numbers of small holders are settled on the land they would find quite an appreciable part of the market for their food-stuffs ready to hand, in supplying the needs for themselves and their families.Whether willingly or unwillingly, we have got to accept the fact that Britain has now become a Protectionist country. Accordingly, our agricultural marketing problem must be treated on the assumption that Protection will be a definite element in our national policy as far ahead as we can reasonably forecast.If tariff protection is to be accorded to any British industries, none better deserves it than agriculture. At present the application of the official Protectionist policy of the Government to agriculture is confused by the terms of the Ottawa Agreement, and in consequence we have a curious mixture of Tariffs and Quotas, which prevent the adoption of a uniform system. It is suggested that when the Ottawa Agreement expires, the tangle of Quotas should be abolished, Within a Protectionist system it would be far better to deal with Imperial Trade by means of straightforward preferential duties. That was Mr. Joseph Chamberlain&apos;s plan, and now Protection is established it is the fairest method of applying it. The Dominions cannot and would not complain. It is exactly the same fiscal measure as they extend to our goods. -Whether the system adopted here is that of Protection or Free Trade, we recommend that effective measures be taken to prevent dumping, whether from foreign countries or from our Dominions. That means the habitual selling of food from other countries at prices lower than those at which it is sold in the country of origin.In considering what parts of our potential market to concentrate on in the production of home-grown food, special attention should be given to those food-stuffs &quot;which are best eaten fresh and which involve a large amount of labour for their production. Cereals can be grown with a minimum of labour by modern mechanical methods, and can be kept for a considerable period without marked deterioration; whereas eggs . (of which we imported last year nearly  9 million worth), meat, vegetables, fruit, and dairy produce are obviously far better fresh; and they all require much more labour for their pro-duction and distribution than do cereals. It is suggested that the British farming industry, and particularly the additional cultivators settled on the land as a result of a policy of development, should concentrate specially upon these forms of produce.(viii) Reorganisation of Collection and Distribution.Provided that a normal and fair price level for agricultural produce can be maintained, free from the inroads of overseas dumpers, and the demand turned in favour of the home-grown article, it still remains to ensure that the producer should get his full and fair share of the ultimate selling price. There is now an indefinite and unbridged gap between the price paid to the. producer and that which is exacted from the consumer. That gap must be reduced and made traversable for our producers by a more efficient organisation for collection and distribution.Opinions differ as to the value of the services which the Marketing Boards set up by the Ministry of Agriculture are. rendering to the agricultural community by . organising producers and improving producers&apos; prices. The fruitfulness of their efforts is unfortunately handicapped by the fact that they have not yet been able to organise collection and distribution of farm produce on any large scale:   Their
SGconstitution tends to limit their scope in this respect, with the result that they may assist to perpetuate the present wasteful system of distribution of food to consumers. This is a defect which, should be remedied without delay.We have much to. learn from Danish methods of scientific food production. The system.they have developed for supplying our British bacon market must be studied with a-view to reducing the cost of our pig production. At present, 80 per cent, of our pig products come from across the sea. This proportion should be reversed. Organised collection and bulk transport of farm produce would save the farmer a great many unnecessary overheads which he now incurs.(ix) Propaganda.A great educational campaign should be launched to demonstrate the superior dietetic value of fresh, home-grown food stuffs. Such a campaign would be soundly based on facts, and could achieve, if properly conducted, a revolutionary change in the dietetic habits of the nation. There is no reason why we should feed on the stale, dry or frozen food surplus of other countries when we could be enjoying fresh food grown at our doors.To carry out the various schemes here outlined for reclaiming and reconditioning the land and repopulating the countryside will require the investment of a good deal of capital, but if the total -annual value of the various subsidies now being paid to agriculture from wheat, beet sugar, beef and milk were capitalised, the resulting sum would enable a far more thorough and remunerative reorganisation of the industry: -to be carried out, and the British agriculturist put into a far stronger position for profitable farming than is possible by means of these piecemeal doles. This capital investment will, have the merit that it will not only create a great deal of employment in the actual tasks of re-equipping the land, but will provide a permanent additional field of employment for a considerable section of the nation. Criticism may be directed against details here and there, but when it has said its worst there will still remain the fact that here are -our idled or half-starved areas; here are our idle and under-fed men. In the name of common-sense we must contrive somehow to make better use of both. It is reasonable to consider objections^ It would be folly to let them paralyse action in such a situation^ - There are always grave objections to any course, however reasonable and necessary it may be.Chapter X. Hours op Labour and Allied Questions.Attention has already been drawn to the seriousness of the Unemployment problem. This was, indeed, the main factor which led us to formulate the plans contained in this Report. But there is one feature of the Unemployment position which has not yet been stressed. As a result of the application of science to industry, a- revolutionary increase in production per head has been going on, which has caused a progressively rapid displacement of labour. More goods can be produced for fewer man-hours of human work. This is a situation that has not yet been really faced. Its implications are not unpleasant. If increased output can be attained with a smaller volume of human labour, iw&apos;e: need not rush our juveniles so early into the labour market, nor hold : our workers to such long hours or years of toil. SimuL taneously, a marked decline has taken place in our foreign trade, coupled with a diminution in our foreign lending, so that the oppor-tunity for bur people to earn money by working for the foreign market has been greatly contracted. :In, order to meet these. changed conditions we propose : : (a) The removal of young people from the labour market by raising the school-leaving age to 15, and making fuller use &apos;&apos; &quot;! of continuation schools and vocational training. (b) The provision of adequate pensions at :the age Of 60 on con-- - &quot;&apos; :ditions that those receiving them retire from paid employ-1    ; - &quot;:i ment.-(c) Wherever possible the reduction of the weekly hours of labour for workers in general.
The policy of raising the school-leaving age, as everybody knows, was strongly advocated in the Hadow Report, and it formed part of a carefully thought out scheme of educational reorganisation. It has also the universal approval of practically all educational authorities. This proposal, which should be supplemented by a more efficient system of vocational training, would have the further advantage of reducing unemployment amongst adults.Our policy should aim at the encouragement of a reduction in the weekly hours of labour, with a five-day week, in those industries which can adopt this plan immediately without any increase in the real cost of production. Co-ordinated plans of development of our national, resources should result in raising the general standard of living. This, implies that the advantage of increased production would be shared by the whole community. It might thus prove possible to reduce the hours of labour over a wide field, without any real increase in the cost of production.All social students will agree  hat there has been a marked advance-in the standard of living of the lower-paid workers in this country, as compared with their pre-War position. But few will contend that their present standard is satisfactory. The two most complete surveys made in recent times bear out this statement. Those who were responsible for carrying out the New London Survey found that 11 per cent, of the sampled population in East London fell.,below the poverty line, say, one family out of every nine. On Merseyside, a depressed area, the position was even worse. There, about one family out of every six sampled was discovered to be in poverty.-The standard of poverty used in these two surveys was virtually the same, and it was intentionally fixed on a conservative basis. Those who have gone into the question critically will not dispute the extreme Rlenderness of the living attained on the defined poverty line. The allowance for food is definitely below that recently estimated as the minimum required for adequate nutrition by a Committee of the British Medical Association, which may be accepted as the most authoritative pronouncement upon the subject.It follows that there is immeasurable scope for extending the consumption of the working classes and improving the quality of their diet, in order to counterbalance the immense increase in productive capacity to which we have previously drawn attention. While this is true in general, it applies with particular force to those in the community who are in poverty, if they are to enjoy the standard of living which we feel should be available for all who are prepared to contribute to the common welfare by doing a fair day&apos;s work. But that test can only be offered by so organising production as to provide suitable openings in industry for all who are capable of work.Chapter XL The Relation of these Projects to Unemployment.All the proposals in this programme relative to public works of development and improvement are submitted for adoption upon their own merits. None of them has been advanced merely because it would provide employment.Every one of these suggested projects will have to be carried out ultimately, if the country is to be fully developed, properly reorganised and equipped for fruitful activity, and if its population is to be decently and comfortably housed, clothed and fed, and given a reasonable measure of safety and amenity.Consider the actual projects which have been mentioned as deserving to be expedited at the present juncture. They include the following : ;(1) Housing and slum clearance; and this not merely or mainly in and around areas already built up, but on an intelligent regional plan, which will bring suitable fresh areas into development and give the nation&apos;s workers better opportunities of fresh air, sunlight and recreation.(2) Land reclamation, drainage, reconditioning; afforestation; improvement of farm buildings, farm, roads, farm water supply; land settlement and establishment of agricultural training settlements.[11318]. g
(3) Allotments, open spaces and playing fields.(4) Eoad developments; bridges; airports. : .(5) Extension and improvement of electrical supply.(6) Electrification of suburban railway lines.(7) Improvements in railway rolling-stock.(8) Canals. ,.- : &apos;  &apos;   -(9) Water supply. .(10) Telephone extensions.(11) Improvement of ports and harbours. . &apos;(12) Financial assistance for development of overseas markets.Which, if any, of these items can be struck off the list as unnecessary and uneconomic? Which of them does not require to be carried out as soon as may be Within the next few years, if the country is to be Well-equipped and well-ordered, and its industries, urban and agricultural, fitted for real progress? Most of them, indeed, are operations for the maintenance of which statutory provision already exists, and on which public money is to-day being spent,, but to an inadequent extent.The immediate or emergency issue is, in fact, not whether these operations should be embarked on, but the extent of the programme that ought; to be adopted under each head, and the pace at which it should be carried through. These determine how great an impact a public works programme can have on unemployment.A decision, on that issue as to the absolute and relative size of each item in the programme,, and the degree of priority to be given it, must be based upon a full survey of the needs of each, and of their relative value and urgency. That is a matter which can only be dealt with after examination by the proposed Board of National Development, which would have the duty of collecting all information and submitting it to analysis and review. But even in advance df that full survey, there is abundant evidence of the need for these works.Granted, that they are needed and desirable, how soon shall we proceed to;,carry ,them out? Surely the sooner the better, provided that we .have the means.... What, constitute the means in this connection? They are: Finance,; Labour; and the courage to act.. As to finance, I have already shown that the bank returns reveal a big surplus of capital unable at present to find productive iilvest-ment. . Taking only the growth of bank investments in gilt-edged securities, there is apparent a surplus of more than  300 million held there as compared with the level in years of active trade. The contraction.in new capital issues compared With active years hints that at present some  200 million a year of the nation&apos;s savings is without suitable openings for investment.Clearly there would be no difficulty in raising immediately for purposes of national development a Prosperity Loan of  250 million. J am advised that this could be done without seriously disturbing the present cheapness of money. Such a loan could be raised at 3 per cent., or with interest, sinking fund for 60 years, and cost of issue, it would: involve an annual charge of about 3j per cent. say,  8J million a year. The new regulations for the expenditure of the Public Assistance Board on maintaining the unemployed are estimated to cost the nation an increased annual payment of not much less than that.I propose that a loan of this character should be raised and devoted to the carrying out of an accelerated programme of productive public works, especially during the next two years. At the end of two years the situation can be reviewed to ascertain the extent to which the revival of domestic industry and of colonial development and overseas trade had stimulated investment and employment in the more normal productive channels. ; &apos;In addition to the proposed loan the effect of bringing back those now out of work into regular employment would be to save, the country a,very large proportion of the money at present.being spent&quot; in main-taining the unemployed. This amounts now to about  110 million per annum. If unemployment were brought down to the pre-war level in times of prosperity three-quarters of this sum would be saved, or over  80 million.   This is all drawn in one form or another from
the-pockets of the taxpayer. And in addition, the income from the contributions of those in: work to the&apos; unemployment fund would greatly increase-unless, as might well be the case, advantage were taken of the improvement to lower the rate of contribution; In any event, the savings and possibly the increased income would place at the disposal of the nation financial resources which could be utilised to supply credit for further developments without invading the ordinary money market. !-!T;i-;&apos;.&quot;. For reasons given later on, it is probable that not the whole of! the proposed  250 million loan, plus the savings, would be actually expended within the first two years, and a surplus would still be available in the following years for financing the. carrying- through of later stages of the programme.Allied with the present abundance of cheap money is the present low. price of materials. Take, for example, Housing. The cost of building materials per foot super is to-day only two-fifths what it was-, in 1920. The inflated price of land, as well as the high cost of materials, which at that time handicapped the post-war land settle-rnent scheme, has also now fallen considerably. Cement, structural steel, implements, machinery, almost every material is cheaper. Not: biily the fact that money is at present plentiful and cheap, but the further fact that its purchasing power is exceptionally high &quot;owing to&apos;1 the fall of wholesale prices, makes the present an opportunity of special advantage for carrying through the public improvements and developments which the country needs. :.The next item in our consideration of our means is the&apos; available labour. Beyond question, there is more than enough work to be done upon these projects to provide employment for all the available labour.. In deciding how much of the development programme can be carried through in the next two years, we are likely to be limited, not by any deficiency in the supply of cheap capital, but rather by the numbers of workers who can be turned on to the job.At present according to the statistics of the Ministry of Labour, the constant figure, of unemployment is in the neighbourhood of 2,100,000. The Ministry&apos;s calculations indicate that this total is made up of people suffering from lack of work in various degrees, from those who have been out of work for several years to those suffering just a short spell of unemployment between jobs, or temporarily suspended through short time or slackness iri the trade to which they belong.About half the total number of unemployed1 at any1 time are workers who have been less than three months out of a job. Of these, roughly 400,000 are classed as &quot; temporarily unemployed,&quot; and are workers on short time or suffering a brief intermission of employment through trade slackness or weather conditions. The remaining 600,000 odd are either juvenile entrants who have just entered the labour market and are not yet placed, or workers who have recently lost their jobs, but of whom the greater number expect before long to get work again in their own trade. -A policy of expenditure on useful public works would quicken trade all round. Orders for material and machinery for the various enterprises would flow in. There is hardly an industry that would not&apos; be benefited. But, apart from that, the increase in the purchasing capacity of the unemployed households by the substitution of wages for the dole, and by the increase in the profits of business-would increase the volume of trade, and therefore of ehiployment. The. effect on the short-timers would be immediate. &quot;With the improvement in general trade the short gaps in employment; would, thus be -filled up or appreciably shortened.. This indirect stimulus to employment would go very far to solve-the unemployment problem for a large number of those suffering brief,, spells, of worklessness.-:-. There would not therefore be any necessity to. cater for these cases directly by the public works! programme.The remaining 50 per cent, of the unemployed have been longer without iwork, and some 400,000 of them are a permanent army of workless, of whom many have done no work for years, anda very considerable: and growing, number have never had any employment at all. : But, will it.be necessary to find work for these 50 per cent.? For some of them only for&apos;ia very short period. It will be found [11313]: g 2
that&apos;the&apos; limiting factor in any great programme of development, especially as it proceeds, will not be any shortage of work needing to be-done, nor yet shortage of capital to finance it, but rather the limited volume of available labour which is otherwise surplus to the demands of the market. That surplus may be expected to be at its maximum -during the first two years that the programme is running. Let us examine the proposition, as it has a dominant effect on the dimensions of the problem. We clearly cannot expect any appreciable number of the temporarily unemployed to take, up jobs outside their own trades on schemes under the public ; developments programme if the period of waiting for the next. job. in their own trades is cut down to. a few weeks in a year. So far as they are concerned, the revival of trade and industrial activity may be expected indirectly to benefit them by shortening, and to a large extent abolishing, the short time and spells of unemployment from which they suffer. This would be the first impression which would be made by a bold policy of expansion on the numbers of the unemployed.-To. this must be added the probable effect on the labour market of raising the school age to 15. The Ministry of Labour estimates that in 1935, 837,000 boys and girls will reach the age of 14, of whom 411,000 will be available for employment. Raising the school age will keep these off the labour market and the unemployment register; and to some extent the jobs they might have taken will be filled by older juveniles. The net result will be to decrease the number of the, unemployed, probably by at least 200,000. In conjunction with the-raising of the school age to 15, there should be arrangements for continuation,, classes and vocational training of juveniles after they, leave, school. This will serve the double purpose of greatly increasing, the educational standard and the industrial and commercial efficiency of the next. generation, and of reducing the immediate pressure of juveniles on the labour market.It, has been suggested that special training in the arts and crafts and in the cultivation of the land should be provided. This would :furpish,,a whole time occupation for another 100,000. Then there has always been a percentage of &apos;&apos; unemployables&apos;&apos; even in periods of prosperity. Before the War, these were computed to be about a quarter of. ft million.   They call for special treatment.&apos; After, deducting (1) Those who would be re-absorbed into ordinary trades by the, increased industrial activity which would ensue from a - development policy;(2.) Those who would be.withdrawn from the labour market by a raising of the school age; and :.,(-3j) By-training facilities; also . (4).The .unemployables; ...the -actual ^numbers who might be available for work created by a public works programme would be considerably under the million, and when.the policy was in full operation that figure,would diminish owing, jo.the increasing demand of ordinary industry. It must also be. borne, in&apos;mind that for every man placed in a job, another man is given&apos; employment on materials, transport, &amp;c. Direct work would -thus hiive to be found for only, half the available surplus. During the first two, years there will still be a sufficiently large surplus of labour to make it possible and desirable to accelerate the carrying out of public improvements on a scale which can utilise a labour force of this size., :The recommendations of the Development Board in regard to the nature and location of the works to be undertaken will have1 to be framed with due regard, to the quality and, distribution of this available labour. Preference will doubtless be given to those schemes which&apos; can he put in hand near the districts where there, are large numbers of&apos;workless, to schemes which involve a high proportion of labour, and to schemes which draw their materials from industries... that are in special need of stimulation. ,.,&apos;.&apos;.. ,&quot;,&apos;,.&apos;,&apos;&apos;Row soon could these works be put in hand?&apos;It must,&apos;of course, be recognised that if the Government were, forthwith to decide to adopt the policy I have outlined, and were to proceed to carry out the initial steps of a working Cabinet, the
setting up a Board or Council of-National Development and;making a survey of the nation&apos;s resources and requirements; and if it were to use the utmost despatch in obtaining full powers from Parliament and - then: pressing forward with programmes of housing, roads and other public improvements, industrial reorganisation, land develop-ment and land settlement, it would be fully six months before the actual operations in most fields : could be set going on a really u extensive scale, and the direct employment created by them could engage a large number of the workless. It would, of course^ be possible to start at once on a number of schemes for rural.housing, land drainage, road improvement and slum clearance; which already wait on the files. On the other hand, the bulk of the proposed developments would take a good deal longer to set in action. Preliminary work on surveys, making arrangements with local authorities, conducting public enquiries, negotiating with land-owners, would have to be completed; and only in the course of the second six months would the majority of the schemes begin to filter out from the network of these delaying preliminaries.This does not by any means imply that little of value would happen for the first six months to reduce unemployment. Long before the actual schemes envisaged in the Development programme came into full operation, there would be a marked psychological improvement, with an immediate material benefit to the&apos; trade of the nation. VL&apos;;&quot;The present feeling throughout industry and commerce is one of apprehension. The expectation which had begun to show itself a little while back that there would shortly &quot;be a trade revival, possibly amounting to a boom, has faded. People of an enterprising habit, who are disposed always to start their preparations well in advance when better trade is in prospect, are to-day holding back. - They are afraid of what the future may bring forth in the shape ; of fresh depression. ;  7Were the Government now to announce its decision to embark immediately on a policy of bold schemes supported by adequate finance, and raise a Prosperity Loan as a guarantee that it means business, such people would say: &quot;That means an era of good trade! &quot; and they would forthwith prepare to take full advantage of the coming prosperity by launching out in their own industries&apos; and commercial undertakings. More production would be undertaken, more orders placed, and the existing industries of the nation would take on more hands.Thus even during the first six months, while the main efforts of the Government and its advisers would be taken up with inVestiga-tions and preparations of plans and the preliminary tasks of securing estimates and placing contracts, the effect of their adoption of this programme would be felt immediately in an increased buoyancy of industry and a growth of employment.Thereafter the stimulus to trade and industry would become direct, as orders poured in for materials, and fresh demands were made on the transport services, in connection with the carrying out of developments. There would also be a big indirect stimulus to trade, as large numbers of people formerly living below the poverty&apos; line were brought into regular employment and began to buy more food and clothing, boots arid shoes and furniture, to replace&apos;;&quot;the. gaps which long-drawn-out penury has caused; and as the progress of schemes for reorganisation of our basic industries and the &quot;expansion of our foreign and colonial trade began to take effect. The increase, of incomes all round would benefit trades and arts which&apos;,produce more&apos;expensive articles and attractions. ,&quot; 7- At the end of a couple of years the measures I have proposed for increasing permanent employment should be bearing fruit. And here I must emphasise again that the policy I am putting forward is far: from being&apos; merely a scheme&apos;for emergency public mforks, even of the most unchallengeable merit, to give temporary relief to the unemploy-ment-problem. It aims at the permanent revival of agriculture as an. industry regularly employing a larger proportion of the nation; at! the reorganisation of our basic&apos; industries with a view to their greater efficiency and prosperity; at the re-establishment of our foreign frade, with particular reference to&quot; the Par East and the Tropics.; at the fuller development of our Colonies, with permanent &quot;benefit to our commerce and industry; and by no means least, at the revision of
our;-national executive machinery in a way which will make it more capable of keeping under survey pur,economic needs and prospects, - and of carrying out measures to meet not only the present emergency but any future difficulties, as yet unforeseen, which.may from time to.time confront the Government of the day.I anticipate that on such lines we should witness, by the end of a couple of years, an improvement in our international and colonial trade, a revival of our agriculture, and steady progress in the establish-merit - of new industries, which should permanently benefit the employment situation.This does not mean that the public works programme would then be entirely abandoned. Parts of it would unquestionably have to be carried on as a public necessity for some years longer, on as large a scale as the state of employment in ordinary industry would permit. In particular, housing would have to be maintained at full pressure for several years, before we shall overtake our arrears in respect of overcrowding and slums. Some of the larger schemes for bridges and tunnels and other improvements will still be in hand. And the carrying through of the agricultural side of the programme, in particular the creation of small holdings and the settlement of men after training, will be spread over a number of years.If the numbers directly engaged in agriculture are increased by half-a-million, another half-million will be drawn into the country-side, to engage in the numerous trades and services which meet the heeds of our. rural population in the villages, and in the industries ancillary to agriculture.The eventual establishment of a million more workers in the countryside, combined with the steady improvement of our existing commerce and industry and the growth of new industrial develop-ments, will permanently raise the level of employment in this country and provide a prospect of work for all willing workers. Pending the realisation of the full effects of these developments, profitable use can be made of our- workers and our capital in carrying out the urgently needed public works here advocated.It is perhaps worth while to point out that the expenditure proposed on these works will be very far from unremunerative. Unlike our expenditure on maintaining the unemployed in unwilling idleness, it will be a business investment, bringing in definite returns.The capital employed in housing, for example, creates solid assets. The more this housing is carried out in the open country, under regional development schemes, the cheaper it will be, and the less need there will be to give heavy subsidies. Such regional develop-ment, if it makes full use of the betterment values it will create in the land affected by it, will yield a definite profit rather than a loss.- improvements of roads and bridges bring profit in a more indirect manner. There is on the one hand the big reduction in transport delays, congestion, and accidents, which can thereby be achieved-  causes to-day of immense and incalculable loss to the community. On the other hand, such improvements will promote a considerable extension of the number of private motor cars, the income from whose licences would in a few years liquidate the expenditure incurred in the improvement.Electrical extension, it is obvious, is a commercial proposition, on which a definite and growing financial return is to be anticipated. So is electrification of suburban railways. So are telephone extension, afforestation, water works. Much land reclamation will be directly profitable; and a return may be anticipated from much, if not all the expenditure on improving agriculture. Where not direct, there will be ample indirect returns from this expenditure in the increase of the national wealth. In short, none of the money spent will be lost to the community, and much of it will be recovered directly by the State.If, in addition, we set against this expenditure the money we are to-day pouring out without any sort of return in barely keeping the bodies and souls of the unemployed and their families together, it is obvious that, far from losing our money, we shall be saving it by investing it in assets of permanent national value, most of which are commercially remunerative, and through which we shall rescue our unemployed from enforced idleness and provide them with useful work and standard wages.
Among the means which are essential to carrying out this policy, I cited last, but by no means least, the courage to act. Since&quot; I first indicated to the nation the nature of the proposals I am putting forward as a means of dealing with our present distresses, there have been warm and widespread expressions of agreement and approval from the most varied quarters for this programme. But it is useless to applaud a plan unless one is prepared to make! the necessary effort to realise it. And for that, energy and boldness are essential. In this critical hour of the nation&apos;s fortunes, I venture to express the earnest hope that those in whose hands the direction of our national policy shall rest in the immediate future will manifest the courage and vigour needed to carry through such a policy of action. Any other of the items in the programme I have set out might be modified or expanded without disaster. But this condition is vital.
