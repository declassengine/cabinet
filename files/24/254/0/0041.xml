Copy No. QC.P. 85 (35).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.THE GERMAN AIR PROGRAMME AND ITS BEARING ON BRITISH AIR STRENGTH.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.IMMEDIATELY&quot; following the circulation by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of his account of the conversations with Herr Hitler in Berlin,^ I instructed the Chief of the Air Staff to examine the Air position afresh in the light of the following considerations : 1. Herr Hitler&apos;s assertion that Germany had already attained parity with this country in Air strength.2. His further declaration that his objective is the attainment of parity in the air with the metropolitan forces of France plus the French Air-Force in N. Africa.3. The apparent acceleration of the German Air programme, and the consequent reaction which this should have upon not only the rate but also the extent of the expansion Of the Royal Air Force as at-present approved.4. The declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government of achieving parity in the air with the strongest Air Force within striking distance of this country.This examination has now been completed, and I present to my colleagues the attached paper by the Chief of the Air Staff, which contains a reasoned appreciation of the situation and detailed recommendations based thereon with which I am in agreement.While I see no grounds whatsoever for anything in the nature of panic, it is plain that there is grave reason for anxiety as to the future. Strength in the Air is not, of course, to be calculated by numbers of aircraft alone. There are other factors of importance to be considered, such as efficiency, reserves, and industrial organisation. An Air Force is no more the simple aggregation of single-machines than is an army a mere assembly of individuals armed with rifle and bayonet. There is a science of the strategy and tactics of Air Warfare which requires study, organisation and practice more or less prolonged to convert a mass of aeroplanes and pilots into a first-class fighting machine such as we possess in the Royal Air Force. We are at present, and for the next three years, at least, far ahead of the German Air Force in efficiency. The position as to reserves, however, is less satisfactory, and there is reason to believe that the organisation of the aircraft industry for war purposes in Germany is already in advance of that in this country.* Reference CP. 69 (35).[11478] b
Fferr Hitler has himself declared that he does not. care how many aircraft we possess, and has actually invited us to attain parity with the French. I do not doubt, therefore, that the immediate announcement of a decision further to expand the Royal Air Force would have important and beneficial effects. Abroad, it would increase French confidence and militate to prevent a disastrous race in air armaments in Europe, if the only effect of the German effort were seen in fact to be the increase of the odds in the air against her as a possible aggressor. At home, it would redeem a pledge repeatedly given to the people of this Country who are becoming increasingly alarmed by the inferiority of our air strength as compared with that developed, or in course of development, by other great and neighbouring Powers.I seek Cabinet authority, therefore, for the acceptance in principle of a further expansion of the Royal Air Force. While I am satisfied that the proposals submitted to me by the Chief of the Air Staff are fully justified, I should be content, provided that I can obtain authority for the steps immediately necessary to the inauguration of the programme of further expansion, that they should be examined and reported upon by the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament before we reach a decision upon the precise details of the Programme of Expansion.L,Air Ministry, April 15, 1935.GERMAN EXPANSION AND ITS EFFECTS ON THE SECURITY OFTHIS COUNTRY.Memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff. Review of German Air Expansion as estimated in 1934.1. At the time when the Ministerial Committee on Defence Requirements &quot;were compiling their report (CP. 205 (34)) they were provided by the Air Staff with such evidence as was then available with regard to the probable rate and extent of future development of the German Air Force (Appendix II, CP. 205 i(34)). From that evidence, much of which is derived from most secret sources, the Air Staff concluded that by October 1935 Germany would possess approxi-mately 500 first-line aircraft, and that her ultimate intention was to create an air force at least three, and possibly four, times that size.2. As a result of their consideration of these data, and of all other relevant factors, the Ministerial Committee recommended that the strength of the Royal Air Force should be increased within a period of 5 years by the creation of 41^ new squadrons, including 33 squadrons for Home Defence, and that this programme should be adjusted from time to time in the light of new factors in the situation. The programme which was approved by the Cabinet aimed at providing by 1939 a Home Defence Air Force of 75 squadrons, or 748 first-line aircraft m regular, plus 136 in non-regular, units.3. Subsequently, in November 1934, the Air Staff were able to produce a revised estimate of German intentions (C.I.D. 1159-B) based oh such addi-tional information as had by that time become available regarding the second stage of her Air Programme. This showed that the first stage Was proceeding according to plan, and that a second stage had been designed with the object of attaining a total first-line strength of about 1,300 aircraft by October 1936, with an eventual expansion to a total strength of 1,500-1,600.
Changes in, the Situation revealed, during the Berlin,Conversations,:; ,. -.-i, ! 4/ Up to a short time ago, no fresh evidence of a reliable character had been obtained-to i show that the figures given in the revised estimate mentioned above-were seriously wide of the mark, although recent reports have; indicated that every, effort is being made to accelerate the German Air Expansion Programme as much as possible. However, in the course of the conversations which took place between Herr Hitler and Sir John Simon in Berlin on the 26th.March, 1935 (CP. 69 (35)), the German Chancellor stated in general terms that his country had already reached parity with Great Britain as regards air strength. The exact meaning of this claim was obscure, since in the course of the preceding discussion three separate figures had been mentioned as representing British air strength. A few days ago, however, our Air Attache in Berlin was&apos; officially informed that Herr Hitler&apos;s claim was to approximate parity with our existing First-Line strength, including aircraft in overseas squadrons and in the Fleet Air Arm, but excluding non-regular units, which strength he had assumed to be 800-850 aircraft. In actual fact our present strength calculated on that basis amounts to a total of 888.5. It is possible that this belated elucidation, which is still somewhat vague,,, is an after-thought to explain away what was, in fact, a mistaken statement on the part of Herr Hitler. In any event, if it is interpreted as meaning that Germany has already created an air force of that size consisting of fully organised, trained and equipped first-line squadrons, the Air Staff regard it as a serious over-statement of her present position. Nevertheless, it is believed that if we include reserves and training equipment, there are over 1,300 aircraft of military types, and approximately 1,000 air force pilots, available for the formation of squadrons in existence in Germany to-day. It would be possible, therefore, to classify 800-850 of these as &quot; first-line &quot; leaving the number of reserves available at the moment correspondingly low. But even if it is assumed that the claim is substantially correct only as regards numbers of aircraft as. opposed to organised units, it postulates a considerable degree of acceleration of her previous programme. There is no ground for alarm at the existing situation. Whatever first-line strength Germany may claim, we remain to-day substantially stronger if all relevant factors are taken into account. But the future, as opposed to the present, must cause grave concern, and it is impossible to resist the conclusion that the measures so far authorised by His Majesty&apos;s Government to ensure that in air strength and in air power this country shall not be inferior to any country in striking distance of our shores are in danger of proving seriously inadequate.Germany&apos;s Future Intentions.6. With regard to the final first-line strength which Germany intends, to develop and to maintain, Herr Hitler informed Sir John Simon that &quot; The parity which he demanded was parity with the Force in Metropolitan France, plus that in North Africa.&quot; Again, the precise meaning of that statement is not entirely clear. The present first-line strength of the French Air Force in those two regions is known by us to total 1,404. On the other hand, the estimate of France&apos;s total first-line strength in April 1935, as stated on the diagram handed to Sir John Simon at Berlin, is 2,091, and although this includes att her colonial air forces, it has since been explained to the British Air Attache that this total is regarded as &quot; metropolitan.&quot; Since, however, this latter statement contradicts that made by Plerr Hitler himself, and since the diagram shows strengths of European air forces (including bur own), which in the opinion of the Air Staff are in excess of the truth in nearly every case, it is not considered that the figure of 2,091 is one which can seriously be regarded as Germany&apos;s present goal. The evidence available during the past twelve months has led the Air Staff to conclude that her present aim is a total first-line strength of some 126 squadrons, or 1,512 aircraft,, and since this figure is comparable with, although rather higher than, the actual French strength in France and North Africa, that figure has been taken as the basis for the proposed increases in the British Air Forces which follow (paragraphs 12-21).    . -  . - . &apos;7. The eventual composition of the German air force is still to some extent a matter for conjecture, but such information on this subject as has been received[11478] b2
up .to the present- time indicates that it: will be organised and equipped approximately as follows : - :     , ,:.     ,. ....Heavy Bomber Squadrons ... 30 - -        !     &quot; - 1-    :    :   Medium Bomber Squadrons 15 ;Light Bomber Squadrons ... 13 -Dive Fiomber Squadrons    ... 9Total Bombers ...       ...     67 Squadrons or    804 aircraft..Fighter Squadrons ...      23Total Fighters ...      ...     23 Squadrons or    276. aircraft.Coastal and Naval Squadrons 15 Army Co-op. Squadrons ... 10 Reconnaissance Squadrons ...      11Total for Co-operationduties       ... ...      ...     36 Squadrons or    432 aircraft.Grand Total ...       ...   126 Squadrons or 1,512 aircraft.It will be seen that the total number of aircraft regularly allotted to bombing duties is 804, but it must be realised that a proportion of those in the reconnaissance and co-operation categories might be employed on bombing operations also. It is estimated that such additions might increase the total first-line strength which could be devoted to the bombing offensive to 950 aircraft, and that this might be still further increased by the use of converted civil aircraft.8. Assuming, then, that a first-line strength of approximately 1,512 aircraft is Germany&apos;s aim, it remains to discover by what date her present process of expansion will reach that figure. The latest information points to the fact that Germany hopes to complete the programme in the early part of 1937. The Air Staff are aware of the careful preparations which have been made in Germany to organise the aircraft and aero-engine industry for mass production methods. Immense efforts have been made to ensure that the industry can change from a peace to a war footing with the minimum delay, and the number of men employed in it has increased by over 183 per cent, in the last 18 months. Our Air Attache in Berlin has recently been told that Germany is aiming at factory output in war sufficient to make good 50 per cent, wastage per month after the outbreak of war, and there is good reason to believe that the present rate of production is at least 200 aircraft of all types per month (including civil types), and possibly more. These preparations, together with the elementary training of large numbers of pilots in her Air Sports Association, will without doubt facilitate a very rapid development of her air force in the future. Moreover, this high degree of industrial organisation will, in war, enable her to make good her initial losses in a much shorter space of time than can those countries whose reserves are less well organised, and it consequently enhances her air strength to a greater degree than the effect of numbers alone. . .9. Failing any definite proof to the contrary, a review of the various factors mentioned in the foregoing paragraph leads to the conclusion that Germany aims at attaining a first-line strength of about 1,512 aircraft by April 1937, and that a minimum of approximately 804 of these might be employed for offensive bombing operations. Appendix 1 of this Paper contains three tables showing (A) Germany&apos;s probable rate of future air expansion based on a strength of 800-850 at 1/4/35, (B) the 1934 Air Staff estimate of what her expansion was likely to be, based on the information then available, and (C) our own expansion up to 75 Home Defence Squdrons by 1939 as at present authorised. A comparison of table (A) with table (C) makes is abundantly clear that, as far as metropolitan air strength is concerned, if Herr Hitler&apos;s statement is to be accepted at its face value, we have already fallen behind Germany, and that as things stand we shall, by April 1937, possess but half her number of first-line aircraft.
&quot;&apos;r&apos;f10&apos;. But, as stated in paragraph 5, the Air Staff cannot iri the absence of more definite evidence believe that Germany to-day possesses an approximate first-line strength of 800-850 aircraft, that is-to: say,-about-70Tregular squadrons all up to full strength in personnel and established at adequately prepared aerodromes. However, there is no reason why she should not; shortly have that number of squadrons, and the important matter is not what her rulers say they have got at the moment, but their intentions. It is quite clear that Herr Hitler intends to have an air force equal to the French, and as he has over-estimated the French first-line strength by some 25 per cent., he may propose to go up to a first-line strength of some 1,800. Nevertheless, as shown in paragraphs 6 and 7 above, the figure of 1,512 which represents the estimate reached by the Air Staff prior to the Berlin conversations seems to represent the most likely intention. Further, although they have concluded that the German expansion programme aims at reaching this strength by April, 1937, the Air Staff are of the opinion that it will be virtually impossible for her to produce within that period an air force so fully organised, equipped and trained that it will be adequately prepared for war. They consider that such a standard cannot be fully attained for at least a further two years after 1937, and that if our own preparations are designed to ensure parity with Germany by 1939, they will be likely to provide the measure of security which we require.Proposed Increases in British Air Strength.11.   Before we can arrive at reasonable conclusions as to the measures which should be taken to this end, it is necessary to examine the implications of the policy of parity.   The metropolitan strength of the air force,, that is to say, all service squadrons located at home exclusive of aircraft embarked in ships . normally in home waters, can be divided into four categories :-- ,&apos; .(a) The Bomber squadrons, which comprise the offensive portion of ah air \ force.yi:   (b) The Fighter squadrons, whose duties are primarily defensive.(c) The Army Co-operation and Reconnaissance squadrons.(d) The General Purpose squadrons, whose duties at home are reconnaissanceover the sea. &apos; ,&apos;It is in regard to (a), the bombing or offensive strength, that parity with a possible enemy is essential. The number of fighter squadrons depends on the area which it is necessary to defend and the intensity of attack to be expected; the number required by one country bears no relation to that required by a possible enemy. The number of Army Co-operation and Reconnaissance squadrons is dependent on the size of the military forces a country expects to maintain. The General Purpose squadrons are required to detect aircraft which may crOss the sea on their way to attack targets in this country, and to assist the other services in the protection of our coasts and sea-borne commerce from attack by submarine or surface vessels. The number of such squadrons required by any particular country depends on the length of its coast line and the degree to which it is vulnerable to these forms of attack; and, again, it does not depend on the number of similar units maintained by a potential enemy.i\.&apos; 1.2. Bombers. The information at, present available as regards the distribution of the projected German first line strength between types is not very definite, but it is probably as given in paragraph 7. It will be seen that the regular bombing force amounts to the equivalent of 67 squadrons of ., 12 aircraft each. If the British Air Force is to attain parity with the German,, it must include a minimum of 67 squadrons. The existing programme&apos;will! provide 47 squadrons, so an addition of 20 will be required.,Kj &apos; 13.&apos; Fighters.---The requirement in fighter squadrons is 25 for the new . alignment Of the defences of this country as proposed by the Sub Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence which has examined the subject (H.D.C. Paper 166). and the Air Staff &quot;estimate that 10 fighter squadrons will be&apos;required for despatch overseas to! supplement-1 those allotted for defence by our allies,&apos; and &apos; to protect the area in which the Field Force is located abroad. - Thirty-five fighter squadrons will therefore be; requiredVin &apos; all,; whereas ! thepresent &quot;programme provides for 28/&apos; Thus&apos; aid&apos;jad&amp;iftctoaF7!ffigliter^quadtfons^are^n-eceslsafyij&apos;!(A.

14. Coastal Reconnaissance. If the United Kingdom is to be ready for war with Germany,,, a number of squadrons for reconnaissance over the sea&quot; will be required in order to; detect1 aircraft employing - an : oversea^ to. thiscountry and to assist in protecting our coasts and oilr sea-bbrrie commerce&apos;agaihsit submarine and surface vessel attack. It is estimated that 12 squadrons will be required for this purpose, 6 flying boat squadrons and 6 landplane squadrons. Four flying boat squadrons exist, but the present programme does not provide for any addition to this number. Consequently, 2 flying boat and 6 landplane -squadrons must be added, or 8 squadrons in all.15. Although at the present time the German menace is regarded as the most immediate, the situation in the Far East is not satisfactory, and the Ministerial Committee, when recommending the 1934 programme, expressed their concern that the requirements of the Far East could not be met in full in that programme (C.I.D. Paper 1148-B, paragraph 16). There are also certain requirements in Africa and the Mediterranean which cannot indefinitely be omitted from consideration; moreover, the Air Force is at present completely unrepresented in American waters. Although all these requirements should give place to those of the European situation, it is important that measures to satisfy them should be included in the further programme now under consideration. This will allow the recruiting programme and the personnel policy to be so arranged as to enable due consideration to be given to the interests of the officers and men, a matter of great importance as long as recruiting is voluntary, as well as to the interests of the Service in respect of the standard of recruits. Constant changes in programme require emergency methods of recruiting, and result in recurring periods during which the intake of recruits fluctuates from a maximum to a minimum with seriously adverse affects on the quality of the personnel who offer themselves for service in the Air Force. Squadrons intended for overseas stations could always be retained at home to augment the metropolitan strength if the situation in Europe were to justify such a course. These requirements should now be included, but their completion should be postponed until after the. Home Defence requirements have been met.   They are : Hong Kong Penang ... Ceylon   ... AdenAfrica ... Malta ... W. IndiesSquadrons. 3 1 1 1 4 2 1Total ... ... ...      1316. Fleet Air Arm. Finally, there is the Fleet Air Arm for which the equivalent of 4-1 squadrons (bringing the total aircraft up to 213) were included in the programme approved last year. It is understood that this number will not provide the aircraft necessary to complete the complements of the new ships which the Admiralty anticipate will be commissioned within the next 4 years. Consequently during that period it will be necessary to provide a further 28 aircraft (or roughly the equivalent of 2^ squadrons) and preparations should be made for training the additional personnel required.* The eventual require-ments of the Fleet Air Arm, as estimated by the Defence. Requirements Committee; amount to a total of 402 aircraft (or the equivalent of 35 squadrons), so that the new programme should provide for the addition of a further 161 aircraft (or the equivalent of 15 squadrons) after the financial year 1938-39. Although it is probable that none of these 161 aircraft will be required in the period ending the 31st March, 1939, the training of the personnel and the purchase of equipment-will have to commence before that date. . t*,NoTE.7T-The.majority of these increases to the Fleet. Air Arm would be absorbed into existing &apos;     units and it is consequently anticipated that the-squadron strength at the end of 1938-39: &apos;    would bo 2(1 squadrons.

An investigation has been made during the past three weeks of the extent to which the existing expansion programme can be increased, and it seems possible that some 35-^ additional squadrons could be raised by the 31st March, 1939.   This will leave 2 Home Defence squadrons to be formed subsequently^The sub-joined table shows the new squadrons to be provided in the existing programme and those which it is now considered could be added in the same period (i.e., by the 31st March, 1939) : 	Existing Programme.

Of the total 73 squadrons mentioned in the above table, 65 are for the Metropolitan Force. To complete the full programme of expansion to 194 squadrons, as outlined in para. 17 above, in the years subsequent to the financial year 1938-39 it will be necessary to form  , -     &apos; .   .2 squadrons for Home Defence. y.&apos;;13 squadrons for Overseas. &apos;15 squadrons for Fleet Air Arm.It is suggested that these should be completed by 1941-42, but it is desirable that the whole programme should be authorised this year so that the recruiting of the personnel can be properly organised. &apos; &apos;Reserves. &apos; &apos;&apos; -V&apos;.1-     iUiys20. When the present programme was proposed by the Ministerial Committee it was decided that the greater part of the necessary provision for war reserves of material should be postponed until after 1938-39, only  1,200,000 being provided for. this purpose up to that- year. This was done because it was thought that the deterrent effect at which the Government were
-    [- &apos;0 :;: &apos;&apos; -v:j&apos;:.&quot;aiming required,that, the money available,..except for. the small sum referred to above, should be used to raise a maximum number of squadrons. The Air Staff accepted this view, as, in their opinion, it was unlikely that Germany would be ready for war before 1942. If this view is still held, the same policy can be followed with the new programme, but it is recommended that the . 1,200,000 already authorised for reserves should be increased to  2,000,000 to be spent over the period 1935-36 to 1938-39. If, however, it is thought that this country must, be ready for war within a shorter period, the full amount required for war reserves, i.e:, about  12,000,000 (in addition to the  1,200,000 for which provision is already made) will have to be provided by 1938-39. In the opinion of the Air Staff, however, there is no reason to change the view that Germany will not be ready for, and is not intending to go to, war before 1942.Cost of Proposed Expansion.21. The cost of the expansion of the Home Defence Force to 100 squadrons, (superimposed upon the expansion scheme as authorised in July 1934) in the four years 1935-38, both inclusive, is estimated at approximately  17,500,000. This will be additional to  22,500,000* (of which  3,000,000 is already provided in Air Estimates for 1935) required in that period to complete the scheme authorised in July last.After 1938, further capital expenditure amounting to about  12 milliont will be required for the completion of the present proposals to bring the R.A.F. up to a total strength of 194 squadrons, that amount being additional to the  12 million for war reserves of the Home Defence Force, referred to in para-graph 20 above.22. The recurring level of Air Votes (net: effective services only) on. completion of the programme, will be of the order of  30,000,000 annually. In addition, there will be about  3,000,000 annually on Navy Votes for the Fleet Air Arm. It should be clearly understood that time has not permitted the preparation of detailed financial estimates, but the above figures are approxi-mations of the probable cost.Effect of Proposed Expansion.23. The above proposals will give a British Metropolitan first-line strength compared to the German estimated first-line strength, year by year, as follows : 		British.	Date.	German.				First line.

These latter must, for some years to come, exceed the number of German aircraft embarked in German Naval vessels. If the non-regular bomber squadrons are added to British first-line strength in bomber aircraft, the total will by April 1939 be only two squadrons short of the* The sum originally provided was  20,000,000, but the marked acceleration of the scheme decided on in November last will increase the cost by about  2,500,000.f Of that sum  2J to  3 million, the initial cost of forming new units of the Fleet.

It is perhaps doubtful whether (even if an immediate decision is given) it would be possible to spend as much as this, but on any supposition, a fairly -considerable supplementary estimate over the amount taken in Air Estimates -for 1935 will be needed if the further expansion is to be launched this year.E.
