(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; bGOVERNMENT.)C A B I NET.Restriction of Ribbon Development Bill.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.3oCRET j&quot;c:K&apos;7% (35).COPY NO3As the Home Affairs Committee was informed on 1st April, 1935? departmental discussions were in progress between the Ministry of Transport, the ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the Scottish Office as to the special position of agriculture. It is now proposed that the draft Bill should be. amended in the following respects.Clause J (l) already provides that consent for new agricultural access is not to be refused;    in order to relieve farmers of the necessity of applying for consent, it is agreed that the Bill should provide that such consent shall not be required for the provision or alteration   of gates or fences for agricultural purposes.This will apply to both Clause 1 (standard width line), and to Clause 2 (amenity building line).It is also proposed that the farmer should be relieved of the necessity of applying for consent for the erection of agricultural fences or hedges for the sub-division of his land, (without derogation to the existing provisions of Section if of the Roads Improvement Act, 1925? for the prevention of obstruction to view at corners).allowing compensation to be paid to a farmer in respect of enhanced value of land (within the standard width), arising from a change of agricultural use, including the erection of fences, but excluding the erection of buildings.In clause 6(1)  (a) provision will require to be made for
2nd April,In Clause 7(^)* provision will be inserted to the effect that appeal to the Minister of Transport in connection with an application for consent (whether under clause 1 or under clause 2) in respect of buildings or works used, or to be used, for agricultural purposes will be determined only after consultation with the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.A definition of &quot;agriculture&quot; on the lines.of the definition in the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932, will be inserted in the Bill.The Departments are in agreement on these points and the approval of the Cabinet is sought for these alterations in the present draft of the Bill.It has been considered whether in Clause 2(l)  (b) (amenity building line), provision might be made that an agricultural building, not being a dwelling house, may be erected without the requirement of the consent of the Highway Authority.      This would relieve the farmer of the need for making application, but is open to the grave objection that there would be no check on the type of buildings actually erected or the use to which they were put.      It therefore seems only possible to provide that consent to buildings (other than dwelling houses) required for agricultural purposes should not be withheld or made subject to conditions save such as may be necessary for securing that the buildings shall be used lor agricultural purposes only.L.H-B.
