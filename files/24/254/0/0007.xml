HIS DOCUMENT IS TUB PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC IiAJSSTYsS GOVERNMENT), UJR 1 T.COPY NO.      Jib&apos;CABINS T.COMMITTEE ON UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR AGRICULTURE.SECOND REPORT.1. We sumbltted our First Report to the Cabinet on the17th January, 1935, (&apos;&apos;C.P. 13 (35)).      At their Meeting on the23rd January,  1935,  (Cabinet 5 (&apos;35) Conclusion 4) the Cabinet,after discussing our recommendations reached, Inter alia,  &quot;thefollowing conclusions:-(l)   That the Cabinet regarded sympathetically the policy of insuring Agriculture against unemployment](2)    That the legislation, if decided upon, should beintroduced and passed into law as soon as practicable so as to insure that next Winter may see the payment of benefit and not merely collection of contributions as would be the case during the first six months of operation.On this occasion, however, the Cabinet reserved for further consideration the decision in principle as to whether to proceed with the policy of insuring Agriculture against unemployment.2. At their Meeting on the 27th February (Cabinet 12 (55)Conclusion 10) the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries made a preliminary Report as to the investigations which he, the Minister of Labour, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, had been, conducting on this subject.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer called attention to the provision in the scheme that there should be a period of six  months during which contributions should be paid without benefit;    he urged that, as it was important to start paying benefit in the Winter months, it was highly desirable that the legislation should be passed in time-1
Illfor the contributions to begin not later than July. 1935. The Cabinet accordingly referred the &quot;subject back for further consideration to the Committee.3.     We. accordingly first examined the practicability of securing that the necessary legislation should, be passed so that contributions should commence not later than July, and with this object have been in consultation with the parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury.     We have reached the conclusion that the present state of parliamentary business does not permit of the achievement of this time-table.      We understand that it is considered desirable that benefits should commence to be paid not later than 1st December, 1935, and it appears that even in favourable circumstances it is unlikely that the legislation would be on the Statute Book until the beginning of August, the earliest possible date on which payment of contributions could commence being the 1st Setpember.     we feel bound to add that even this date must be regarded, as optimistic, and it is clear that it may be found in practice that contributions cannot be commenced until somewhat later.If, therefore, it is desired to adhere to the intention to start to pay benefit in the Winter months, say from 1st December,  it  is clear that contributions could not be payable, as the Statutory Committee proposed, for six months before benefit began.      It would therefore be necessary to consider whether it would be possible to alter the conditions of benefit proposed by the Committee to permit payment after a period of (say) three months and whether, assuming the cost of those benefits could not properly be met from the balance the Fund will accumulate in its early operations, a grant could be made from the Exchequer,      We submit this question for    the consideration of the Cabinet,-9--iO-
4. Subject to this very important qualification, weconsider that it should not be impracticable, if the Cabinet so decide, to bring the scheme into operation and to provide for the commencement of benefit by the 1st December, 1935.5o We have also had under consideration the question ofthe rates of contribution and benefit to be adopted.    In our First Report we recommended the adoption if the rates laid down in the Report of the Statutory Committee;    but, after hearing the Report of the Ministers who have been examining the subject, we now think that the rates of benefit provided are too low.    Not only do many -?f us feel that these relatively low rates of benefit are open to objection on political grounds as comparing unfavourably with some current public assistance scales, but we doubt whether, having regard to the fact that where there are no resources,  supplementation from public assistance is likely to be widespread with such low benefit rates, the scheme would provide an adequate defence of the contributory insurance principle, the maintenance of v/hich, after all,  is one of the main objects in pressing on with the scheme of agricultural unemployment insurance at this time o60 The Committee had before them at their Meeting furtherscales of contribution and benefit worked out by the Government Actuary,      The Statutory Committee recommended equal contribution-ions of 4d. per week by the employed man,  the employer,  and the Exchequer.    In the Table attached ae an Appendix to this    .s Report three scales of benefit are set out, based upon contri-buttons of 4d.  (the Statutory Committee&apos;s recommendation), together with scales &quot;based upon contributions of 4-g-d. , and 5d. per week respectively,  the contributions from Exchequer, employer and worker &quot;being assumed to be equal in each case.7. On the other hand, having regard to the probableincrease of the health and pensions insurance contriloutions on
1st January;  19-35, Toy Id,   in the case both of employer andemployed5 the adoption of an increased rate of contribution forunemployment insurance will constitute a not inconsiderablecharge on small agricultural incomes, H 1 9J. 1 oIn the case of both alternatives;  it must be observed, higher rates of &quot;Exchequer contributions are involved,8,      Our conclusion is that, whilst the scale recommended by the Statutory Committee, based upon a 4d,  rate of contribution, is not a practicable one politically,  the choice between the two alternative schemes, based upon the 4-g-d and 5d.  rates respectively,    is one which we should have the authority of the Cabinet to examine in further detail.Summary of Conclusions,We submit the following conclusions and recommendations to the Gab trie t: -(a) It is unlikely that the necessary legislation can in present circumstances be passed to provide for the commencement of contributions at a date prior to the 1st September,  1955;  at the earliest,.      In order,  therefore, to secure that payment of benefit should begin early in the  coming Winter,  it falls -go be considered what alteration should be made in the benefit conditions and whether any deficiency as compared with six months contributions can be provided from the Exchequer;    we submit this for the consideration of the Cabinet,(b) The scales of benefit proposed by the Statutory Committee appear to us unduly low, having regard to the amounts which    unemployed agricultural workers are now receiving by way of relief.      A scale of benefit which is so low that it must in a great number of cases be supplemented from the rates cannot be regarded as a. satisfactory insurance scheme from the point, of view inter alia of the maintenance of the contributory principle.      For these reasons the scales of      : -v benefit suggested by the Statutory Committee should not be adopted.-Signed on behalf of the Committee.JOHN GILMOUR,Chairman.Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1. 9th March,  1935.
