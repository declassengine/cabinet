SECRET. COPY NO.CP. 66(35)CAB I N E T,PLANNING- AND ENABLING BILLS.Note by the President of the Board of Trade.In connexion with Mr. Molson&apos;s Motion on going into Committee of Supply*, I have had the attached memorandum prepared on &quot;planning&quot;.I am circulating it to the Cabinet as I think it will be of interest.W.R.Board of Trade,20th Maroh, 1935*The text of Mr. Molson&apos;s Motion is -On Civil Estimates,  to call attention to Industrial Organisation;    and to move, That, with a view to creating employment by increasing the consumption of British products at Home and abroad,  it is essential that the fullest use should be made both of modern methods of production and distribution and of the present abundance of cheap money,  and that it is desirable for a departmental committee to be set up forthwith to consider what measure of industrial reorganisation is necessary for these purposes and what steps should be taken to this end.
It is common knowledge that many industries have plant in excess of anything that can he profitably employed, at any rate for so long a period as anyone is prepared to prophesy. How the situation arose, and whether those responsible for the industries concerned are to blame or not are irrelevant to the present issue.      The simple fact remains that there is a potential output in excess of all probable demand,  and one result is that many units in those industries are incapable of earning profits.In some industries (notably shipbuilding, wool-combing and flour milling) the producers have arranged among themselves to pay a levy for the purpose of financing a capital sum devoted to the purchase and destruction of surplus plant.      In others, notably certain branches of the iron and steel industry, the coal industry - arrangements which have been generalised and strengthened by the Goal Mines Act,- and sections of tha cotton spinning industry, voluntary arrangements have been made to divide the available orders among the existing users and to prevent &quot;cut-throat&quot; price competition.      In yet other industries, unified financial control (e.g., Unilevers in soap and margarine, heavy chemicals in I.G.I., cement in Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers) has led to unity of policy and concentration of work in the more efficient plants.In yet other industries, the process of slow elimination of surplus plant and surplus producers by bankruptcy is still .v proceeding.But bankruptcy is a very unpleasant process and is only reluctantly accepted - by the bankrupt at any rate - as inevitable.      And so, in many other industries,  there are movements towards the enforcement of one or other kind of control.      The two most &quot;popular proposals are for trade
V:4v;.&apos;.&quot;:;.-&apos;. y^BMM U^VV&apos;^ :;..:./;K::7.&apos;     /.&apos; fj Cr Oassociations which can allocate quotas of output and fix prices,  thus deferring or preventing the bankruptcy of those concerns which can stand the strain for the least period,  and proposals for a compulsory levy to purchase  surplus plant at something above its present market value whether as plant or as scrap.General proposals to enable industries to &quot;re-organise&quot; themselves in this way under statutory powers have been put forward from various quarters.      The group known as P.E.P. have produced a draft bill.      The Industrial Re-Organisation League, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Harold McMillan, M.P., has been formed to promote such legislation.      Various other Members of Parliament,  including especially some of  the younger Conservative members, have expressed sympathy with the general idea.      Lord Melchett has introduced a Bill in the House of Lerds.      And finally, Mr.  Lloyd George appears to contemplate something of the sort in his latest proposals.The supporters of the Enabling Bill begin their argument by saying that it is to nobody&apos;s interest that the present &quot;cut-throat&quot; competition should go on.      They maintain that the result is that no-one in the industry (or hardly anyone) makes any profit, and that the result of these continuing losses is still more desperate under-cutting of prices in order to get a little cash.      In the cotton spinning Industry, for example,   (except for those parts of the field covered by the voluntary arrangements referred to above) every spinner (and there are believed to be at least ten million more spindles in Lancashire than are likely to be employed)  scrambles for any orders that are going if he wants cash to meet his wages bill, or if he optimistically sees in any slight rise in prices a chance to reduce his overdraft.      He starts up idle spindles at any moment,  on orders taken on an unprofitable basis;   .and by so doing, he reduces the prices obtainable by all spinners of similar counts and increases the difficulties of everyone.The end is,  of course, bankruptcy, but many spinners take an&apos; &apos;      -2- j
unconscionable time in dying?  and meanwhile inflict severe losses on all their competitors.      Even when the individuals go under, their mills and machinery at scrap prices hang over the market and may be bought and started up again on a reduced capital basis to compete once more.The &quot;Enablers&quot; or &quot;Planners&quot; suggest that the remedy for this state of affairs is controlled output, controlled prices, controlled reduction of plant;    but,  they say,  this cannot be achieved so long as an obstinate minority in the industry takes advantage of any improvement in prices, obtained by agreement among the majority,  while refusing either to conform to the limitation of output or a fixation of prices, or to subscribe to the fund for the purchase of plant.      Only statutory compulsion can bring the minority in.     Once the industry has been given power to enforce the decisions of a majority,  it can plan the orderly adjustment of output to demand, and once more put the industry on a prof.it-earning basis.      When that has been done, they say, the industry will be able to reduce its costs by obtaining firm orders and longer runs for the more efficient producers.      These producers will in turn be able to make them-selves still more efficient;    so long as the industry is not on a profit-earning basis,  they have no funds of their own, and can obtain ono funds elsewhere, for improvement and development.The &quot;Planners&quot;, of course, go further than the &quot;Enablers&quot;, though ultimately there is no real distinction between them.    The &quot;Planners&quot; contemplate an entirely new economic structure in which output, prices,  development, research, are all controlled by a series of Boards controlling particular industries.     All those adjustments at every stage of production - which are at present effected by the comparatively simple operation of price mechanism -are to be made instead   at the discretion and on   the judgment of these Boards.     But perhaps it is not necessary to pursue those proposals further at this stage.. The main general objections to the &quot;enabling&quot; policy can be stated fairly simply.
Parliament is asKed to give statutory sanction to the operations of a series of monopolies, which might cover all the industries of the country.    It is true that the express power to fix prices has now been dropped,  in the sense that it is not specifically mentioned.    P.E*P.  expressly state that their draft bill would not give price-fixing powers. Lord Melchett*s Bill refers to &quot;eliminating wasteful competition&quot;.    But price fixing is implicit in the power to fix quotas of output and in the power to prevent new entrants.The State has, throughout history, regarded monopolies with suspicion, even though in the past there has always been the safeguard that the greater the immediate profit which a monopoly tried to make,  the greater was the inducement to others to enter the industry outside the monopoly.    But here the monopoly is to be statutory.    It is to be set up primarily to restrict output and to raise prices - and if Parliament,  like a fairy godmother,  gives these powers as christening gifts,  the monopolies are lixely to make use of them in later life.    The general object of the promoters of these schemes is stabilisation of the industry concerned at a lower level of output and a higher level of prices.    The remedy for an economic condition which is the result of excessive rigidity and too many restrictions    is to be a stabilisation which must become an ossification.Once a scheme had been approved and enforced,  there wouldbe no inducement to those engaged in industry to developeither their own businesses or their industry as a whole -or at least,  the ordinary inducement would be very much reduced.    There would be much less inducement to TootalBroadhurst1s,  for example,  to spend  80,000 on researchdevoted to producing a creaseless fabric (as they did) if theyhad already a statutory share of the industry&apos;s output and profits,  and could only obtain more by arguing with the rest
9 7 * ^ t xof the industry, who had not shown equivalent enterprise,  as to how much the process was worth in new trade and how much of that new trade ought to accrue to them.Most,   if not all,  of our industrial development in the past has been due to the readiness of individuals to take risks *   They have been prepared to experiment and to develop new or existing industries in the belief that if they were successful, they would obtain the reward of success.    That reward has often been in fact the winning of business from some other less efficient or less enterprising firm - the very process which the &quot;enablers&quot; wish to prevent in the future. There would be no Morris in the motor industry, no Whitehead in iron and steel,  none of the big stores in the  retail trade, if those industries had been controlled a generation ago ; and there will be no new Morris or Whitehead if they are controlled now.It is in our export trade that the results are likely to be most harmful and it is there that we are most in need of enterprise.    The industrialisation of parts of the world formerly our markets means that in future our sales will depend more and more on our being able to offer new lines of goods, more novelty, better quality.    Unfortunately,  if the industrialist has a comfortable life at home, with no worries, and an assured income, he will not be anxious to take the risics and stresses of the competitive export market.The &quot;enablers&quot; claim that they can provide safeguards against these and other risks.   The consumer is to be entitled to appeal to an ad hoc committee of investigation - a procedure the efficacy and in particular the celerity of which we have learned to doubt.    A minority of producers is to be entitled to appeal to  an arbitrator.    And so forth.    It is impossible to imagine any active enterprising business being carried on under all the restrictions of these schemes with,  added to them,  all
the uncertainties of possible appeals and counter-app-eals in almost every transaction.The position of an enterprising individual concern wcul&apos;1 indeed be unhappy.    The directors who wished to develop and expand the  business would find themselves checked and controlled by the directors of other concerns.   They might find  themselves obliged to explain to their shareholders that they were no longer responsible for the efficient management of the concern,  and the safety of the shareholders&apos; investments. Logically,  the shareholders should then be entitled to claim that the State should buy them out,  and should assume the financial liabilities which ought to accompany control.There is another serious difficulty which the promoters of these measures refuse even to discuss.    They assume that Parliament will be content to pass a measure enabling a tribunal to  grant these powers to industries,  and will thereafter refrain from interference.    This is absurd:    even without recent experience it is obvious that Parliament will not give industries these powers without continuing to take a very lively interest in how the powers are used,  in what prices  are charged,  and in what profits are made.    The immediate result of &quot;enabling&quot; would be the creation of a series of large statutory monopolies,   exercising powers whose general effect must be to restrict  enterprise and development. The next stage would be constant interference with those monopolies under Parliamentary instructions:    So much is certain.Soard of Trade,18th March,   1935.
