This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet, March, 1935SECRET.Corr No. 3 iCP. 56 (35).THE CABINETTHE ARMY AND AIR FORGE (ANNUAL) bill memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI circulate herewith the Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill.   Apart from two     110 small consequential amendments contained in the Second Schedule, five amendments   General are proposed this year.   The first three affect both the Army Act and Air Force Act,     4878 whilst the fourth and fifth affect the Air Force Act only.None of these amendments calls for special attention. Their purport is set out briefly in the memorandum attached to the Draft Bill. They involve no question of principle, and in so far as they are not merely clarifying or drafting amendments, they are of departmental administrative interest only.Owing to the incidence of Easter it is essential that the Bill should receive Royal Assent before the recess. I therefore ask the concurrence of my colleagues in the immediate circulation of the Bill.H.The War Office,15th March, 1935.(b85/8;   70   3/35   w.o.p.   8465
Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill.INTRODUCTORY  MEMORANDUM. Clause 4.The first proviso in s. 64 (4) secures that a soldier sentenced in India or a colony to imprisonment or. detention for a term exceeding twelve months shall (unless there are special reasons for not removing him) be transferred as soon as practicable to serve his sentence in the United Kingdom. The main object of the clause is to make it clear that this proviso applies also to a soldier who is sentenced in a Dominion or a foreign country. The clause also makes a minor amendment in the existing law which will enable a soldier sentenced (for a period less than twelve months) in a colony to undergo his sentence in any convenient place, though in a foreign country. For instance, if serving in Cyprus, he could be removed to a military prison or detention barrack in Egypt.Clause 5.Under s. 163 a document purporting to be signed by or on behalf of the Secretary of State for War, or on behalf of the Army Council, or by the officer in charge of records, is prima facie evidence &quot; respecting the service of any person in, or the discharge of any person from, any portion of His Majesty&apos;s forces, or respecting a person not having served in, or belonged to, any portion of those forces.&quot; It has been doubted whether this pro-vision extends to the proof of particular incidents in a person&apos;s service, e.g., whether he ever attained a particular rank, or served in a particular campaign or foreign country; also, it does not extend to proof or disproof of his right to wear medals or medal ribbons. The object of the clause is to enable documentary evidence to be given with respect to such incidents of service as well as with respect to the mere fact of service.Clause 6.Under the existing law an officer on the reserve list who is serving abroad, e.g., as a member of a military mission, is subject to military law if the senior officer.77-4 A
under whom he is serving is so subject. If, however, he himself is the senior officer, he is not so subject, nor is any other reserve officer serving under him, though officers on the active list serving under him are so subject. The object of the clause is to get rid of these anomalies by providing that an officer on the reserve list will in such cases always be subject to military law, whether he is the head of the mission or other body, or only a subordinate member of it.Clause 8.Subsection (1). Under s. 76 of the Air Force Act an airman may be enlisted for twelve years or any less period. Under s. 78 he may be permitted to extend his term up to twelve years, or for any shorter period. Under s. 84, after serving nine years, he may be permitted to re-engage to complete twenty-four years in all. There is, however, no authority for extending his service or re-engaging him so that he may complete some period between twelve years and twenty-four years. The object of this subsection is to enable some intermediate period to be agreed upon.Subsection (2). Under s. 84 re-engagement to com-plete twenty-four years&apos; service can only take place after the expiration of nine years&apos; service. Consequently, though an airman is accepted for re-engagement some months before the completion of his nine years, the formalities cannot be carried out until the nine years have actually elapsed and, in order to prevent the break which (even when the airman is serving in England) must elapse between the last day of the nine years and the day on which the re-engagement is formally completed, it is necessary, before he completes nine years, to extend his service under s. 78 for a period during which the formalities of his re-engagement can be carried out. The object of this subsection is to do away with the necessity for this extension by permitting the re-engage-ment to be effected after the completion of eight years.::&quot; .   ...    . .   .......  , . iV . . .     ... . .       .    ..        .     ..........Clause 9.This is a drafting amendment necessitated by the fact that matters which in the army are regulated by Royal Warrants are, in the case of the air force, regulated by orders of His Majesty.
