THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1935.MOST SECRET. Copy No.CP. 46 (35).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.GENERAL PURPOSES COMMITTEE.Interim Report.1.   THE Committee were appointed at the Meeting of the Cabinet on the 30th January, 1935 (Cabinet 6 (35), Conclusion 1), to consider questions of Government Policy which do not fall solely within the scope of any single-Department,  and  with  authority  to  submit  to  the   Cabinet  reports  andr recommendations.2. The Committee have reviewed the question of public works, and now submit to the Cabinet the following conclusions on this subject: 3. Public Works, On examination of the effect of public works on. employment, the Committee can only confirm the conclusion previously arrived, at by the Cabinet that the amount of employment provided is insufficient in itself to justify a policy of public works, although it may properly be taken into account when weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of a particular project. Not only is the volume of extra employment to be anticipated trifling compared to that produced by the normal expenditure on works of a comparable-character (including housing), but it is inevitably located largely in the areas where unemployment is least severe, while it is apt to be offset by delay in other projects arising out of the hopes of their promoters that they may presently share in the bounty of the State.4. At the same time the Committee are of opinion that, at certain stages in the process of recovery, and particularly when money and materials are cheap, the undertaking of public works may provide a useful stimulus, by Creating fresh confidence in the public mind as well as by adding something to the flow of capital expenditure, and they recognise that, given such conditions, it may be justifiable to give the necessary impetus by some form of State assistance. In considering whether any proposal is suitable for treatment of this kind, the Committee are of opinion that it should contain features which will distinguish it from other schemes of capital expenditure, and are likely to impress the public imagination by reason of, for example, its magnitude, its.benefit to the general community, its urgency, and the difficulty of bringing it into operation without, some extraneous aid.*5.   Accordingly, the Committee are proceeding to consider what schemes,, if any, should be investigated as fulfilling the general conditions named.* Note. Special considerations? may be given to projects in distressed areas both by reason of the unemployment prevailing therein and the strained finances of the areas.[11257] k
6. State Capital Expenditure.-hi the meantime they are also pursuing investigations into the capital expenditure which is or might be. contemplated over aperiod of years by Government Departments, and into the finWhcral^b^money which should be followed in relation to such expenditure.(Signed on behalf of the Committee) :J. RAMSAY MacDONALD, Chairman.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. I, March 1, 1935.4.
