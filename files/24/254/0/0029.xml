TEIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS ^ITAHNTC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET. COPY NO.:     U 0CP. 73(35). CABINET.&apos;PAYMEMTS TO THE UNEMPLOYED IN RESPECT OF THE JUBILEE. Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.I have to bring before my Colleagues the question making additional pay-ments in respect of the Jubilee Celebration on 6th May to those unemployed who are in receipt of allowances from the Unemployment Assistance Board.With regard to those unemployed who are in receipt of public assistance, a Circular has been issued by the Minister of Health to public assistance authorities to the effect, speaking generally, that any reasonable additions to relief the authorities might decide to make to persons in receipt of public assistance would be regarded as justifiable payments.       The same course has, in effect, been taken by the Scottish Department of Health.       It is known that a number of public assistance authorities will make&apos; payments of the kind suggested, including London, Birmingham, Glasgow and several County authorities.     The payments proposed to be made range,    I understand, from l/6d for each adult and 6d for each child to 2/6d for each adult and l/6d for each child.The Unemployment Assistance Board have had under consideration the question of making Jubilee payments to persons who are in receipt of allowances from the Board.     It has been intimated to me by the Board that while the subject is one on which they would be guided by the wishes of Ministers, subject to this they are desirous of making a payment of an extra allowance of 2/6d in respect of Jubilee week to all persons receiving an v allowance from the Board.     The cost of this proposal would be about  100,000, which would, of course, fall on the Exchequer, and ultimately it would be necessary to pass a Vote for the money, though I understand that this need not be done at once,as it would be possible to provide the money from the Civil Contingencies Fund and take the Vote later.In view of the allowances which are to be made to the unemployed in receipt of Public Assistance, it would place the Board in a most invidious position if the Government was to intervene to prevent similar payments by the Board, and it is an action which the Government might have difficulty in defending, if their attitude should become publicly known.     I have consulted
the Chancellor on the matter and I understand that he agrees with me thathe does not desire to raise any objection to the action proposed by the Board.If, however, my colleagues should agree with this view, a further difficulty will arise.     The unemployed, who are in receipt of public assistance, will receive an additional allowance from the Local Authorities: the unemployed, who are in receipt of Unemployment allowances, will receive special treatment from the Unemployment Assistance Board:   the unemployed, who are in receipt of unemployment benefit, alone will receive no extra grants.     This will undoubtedly produce certain anomalies and may,    I am afraid, cause among a million unemployed in receipt of benefit a certain sense of grievance highly undesirable at a time of national rejoicing. Pressure will be exerted in the House to treat all the unemployed alike and no doubt in the event of refusal attempts will be made to exploit a sense of grievance among those who will receive nothing.The cost of paying an additional 2/6d to all recipients of unemploy-ment benefit would probably be about  150,000.      If this expenditure were to be charged to the Unemployment Fund,   it would be necessary to pass an Act of Parliament before 6th May authorising such a course.     If it were to be borne by the Exchequer, it could technically also be dealt with by a Vote, as in the case of the suggested payments by the Unemployment Assistance Board, but inasmuch as unemployment benefit is not provided for in existing Votes except to the extent of the Exchequer contribution to the Fund, such a course would be open to serious objection and might be held to be in direct conflict with specific undertakings given to the Public Accounts Committee.      On merits, it can be forcibly argued that the cases to which concessions are to be made are cases dealing with the relief of needs, and that to extend such a concession to a class receiving payment, as of right, under statutory provisions, will destroy any logical basis for refusing a further extension to other classes in the same position, such as old-age pensioners, the blind and widows in receipt of pension, or to such a class as War pensioners.     It will be remembered that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, in reply to questions, has already stated that the Chancellor was not prepared to introduce legislation to make a Jubilee payment to old-age pensioners and that it was not intended to make such payments to War pensioners.     The extension of payments to all these classes introduces a dangerous principle
and would prove very expensive.     Moreover, it should he remembered that in any of these cases, whether of unemployment benefit, old-age pensions, blind pensions, etc, where there is need which is evidenced by the fact that the person is in receipt of assistance, he will in fact receive a Jubilee payment either from the Public Assistance authorities or from the Unemployment Assistance Board.     While recognising the force of these arguments,   I am myself inclined to think that they are outweighed by the necessity of avoiding a widespread source of grievance, however unjustified, which might militate against the success of the Jubilee celebrations.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer, however, whom I have consulted, feels that in view of the arguments set out he is unable to agree to any extension of these concessions beyond those classes whose payments are dependent on need.The point on which I desire the decision of the Cabinet p,s whether in view of all the circumstances and in particular of the difficulties which may arise in connection with the unemployed in receipt of insurance benefit, I should inform the Unemployment Assistance Board that the Government raise no objection to the payments contemplated.   .(Intd.)     0. S.   .1st April, 1955. .H.Q.28 - 65.D.E.
