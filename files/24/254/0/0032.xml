Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1935.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 76 (35).CABINET.EGYPT.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE memorandum annexed gives a resume of an aspect of the Egyptian: situation on which an important decision has to be taken. In brief, the question is whether Sir Miles Lampson should be instructed to represent to the King of Egypt on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government that Zakki-el-Ibrashi, Director of the Royal Khassa, should be dismissed from his Court post. Sir Miles Lampson strongly recommends this course. The arguments in its favour, with which I am disposed to agree, in their most summarised form, are the following: (1) If this is not done the present Prime Minister, Tewfik Nessim, will resign,, and present indications are that, unless it is done, he cannot be dissuaded for much longer from resigning. If he does so the probability is, in the absence of a satisfactory alternative head, that a Wafdist Government will be formed. This would be a serious misfortune calculated to involve us in early trouble.(2) Tewfik Nessim is in good relations with the High Commissioner and himself strongly favours the elimination of Ibrashi. He would, co-operate with Sir Miles Lampson in every way to bring this about.(3) It would be impossible to undertake this objective without being prepared to secure it, and we may assume that Ibrashi would fight hard (as he did last autumn) and the King will of course wish to keep his favourite. But the High Commissioner considers that we can carry our point, if need be, by intimating that the failure to accept our advice would call in question the King&apos;s ability to rule and might bring up the question of a Regency. It cannot, however, in the nature of things, be guaranteed that the King would, in fact, yield to pressure of this kind, and there must remain an element of risk as to this. It is assumed, of course, that the Prime Minister would co-operate actively with the High Commissioner in pressing for the removal of Ibrashi, and, indeed, I gather from the telegrams that he would be prepared to take the first step.(4) While any action of this sort exposes us to the charge of interfering with the internal affairs of Egypt (and this charge was freely exploited when we helped to bring about the dismissal of the incompetent Yehia Pasha last autumn), our action would be in support of the existing Prime Minister of Egypt and would, in fact, increase our prestige in the country.J. S.Foreign Office, A pril 4, 1935.7889   [11414]
ANNEX.When at the end of last October King Fuad, in endeavouring to placate His Majesty&apos;s Government, appointed Ziwer Pasha Chief of the Royal Cabinet, he sent the latter to see Mr. Peterson to discuss the then impending fall of the Yehia Administration, which was about to be replaced by that headed by Tewfik Nessim. In the course of this interview, Ziwer Pasha, making great play with the King&apos;s ill-health, begged that we would not insist upon the dismissal of Ibrashi, indicating that if the latter were allowed to remain in the Palace he would play no part in politics. This assurance on the part of Ziwer Pasha was accepted, but has unhappily turned out to have been entirely valueless. After a short interval, Ibrashi, deeply resentful over what had occurred, resumed his intrigues, and there is every reason to suppose that it is very largely due to the influence which this Royal favourite continues to exert on the King, that His Majesty has consistently obstructed Tewfik Nessim during the last four months. As a result, the present Prime Minister has found it impossible to achieve anything of note, and as the weeks have passed his impotence in the face of his Royal master&apos;s hostility on the one hand, coupled with the revival of Wafdist pressure on the other, has so weakened his prestige that it has been considered hopeless to attempt any constructive policy, such as the strengthening of his Cabinet by the appointment of men of influence to ministerial posts. The fact is that no one prominent in Egyptian public life is tempted to form part of a government which it is widely assumed will shortly be dissolved. In these circumstances, no advance whatever can be made towards an attempt to stabilise the political situation through, for example, the creation of a responsible administration of a &apos;&apos; national&apos;&apos; flavour.Although it must frankly be admitted that Tewfik Nessim has proved something of a disappointment, since he has displayed weakness in handling his relations with the Palace, and appears also to lack initiative, he has done his utmost to co-operate with His Majesty&apos;s Government, and there is every reason to suppose that he sincerely attaches importance to such co-operation. While it is not suggested that we are wedded to Tewfik Nessim for good and all, it is difficult to see at the present time who could successfully take his place. Unhappily there is a grave dearth of responsible political leaders in Egypt; the few who commend themselves as likely to prove successful Prime Ministers are for one reason or another not immediately available to assume office, and consequently the High Commissioner feels strongly, and we are inclined to agree, that Tewfik Nessim should be afforded some concrete proof that the support which it is widely known we have extended to him can be of material value. Sir Miles Lampson feels that unless some such proof is afforded, the Prime Minister, already weary of his struggles, will resign; and this, it is feared, would give rise to a period of political confusion, which would open the doors to the assumption of office by a Wafdist administration, likely to be headed by the completely irresponsible Nahas Pasha. In these circumstances, the High Commissioner asks that he should be supplied with a message to deliver to the King from His Majesty&apos;s Government, insisting upon the immediate dismissal of Ibrashi. Such a message would refer to the assurances given by Ziwer Pasha last November, and the regret with which His Majesty&apos;s Government have learnt that, in spite of these assurances, the objectionable activities of this official continue. Reference would then be made to the necessity of a stable internal situation and the smooth and efficient administration of the country, without which the correction of administrative abuses is impossible. The King would also be reminded that the maleficent influence of Ibrashi is notorious and cannot but have an unhappy effect on the sentiments towards the Palace of the King&apos;s subjects. For these and other reasons, the King would be advised to eliminate this influence and to transfer Ibrashi to some post such as the vacant Legation in Washington, where his talents would be better employed.These proposals on the part of the High Commissioner have at once confronted us with a problem as to what pressure would have to be exerted if, as is not impossible, the King rejected the &quot; advice &quot; of His Majesty&apos;s Government. On this point Sir Miles Lampson has been consulted, his attention being drawn ,at the same time to the fact that, as in these circumstances we should be engaged
in a trial of strength with the Palace as distinct from the Government, the use of force (e.g., occupation of the Alexandria customs) would be wholly inappropriate and disproportionate. On enquiring what particular steps the High Com-missioner had in mind, he was also reminded that (a) we could not embark upon the removal of Ibrashi and be beaten by the King, and (b) that, as the Palace as a permanent and stabilising element is a necessary component of a properly balanced political situation in Egypt, it would never do to inflict too much public humiliation upon the Sovereign. To these queries Sir Miles Lampson has replied, agreeing that anything in the nature of the seizure of the Alexandria customs would be entirely out of place. He then expressed the opinion that, if the King were made clearly to realise that His Majesty&apos;s Government were determined, he would yield; if not, an intimation that his capacity to rule would be called in question ought to prove effective; if His Majesty still resisted, it would be necessary to make the Prime Minister insist on a regency on the ground that the whole machinery of government had been rendered unworkable. (It will be clear from this that Sir Miles Lampson does not attach any special importance to the argument about humiliating the King; he states, in fact, that some humiliation of His Majesty would be unavoidable.) In all this, Sir Miles Lampson added, he would closely concert action in advance with Tewfik Nessim, discussing with the latter at the same time whether in addition to the elimination of Ibrashi we &quot; ought not to insist simultaneously on the settlement of such other fundamental questions as he could convince me were essential to the proper functioning of his Government, e.g., the rectorship of Cairo University,&quot; &amp;c.This memorandum has been prepared because while it is generally agreed that the elimination of Ibrashi is long overdue, it is necessary to face the fact that Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s proposals foreshadow a conflict with the King, which may necessitate the application of pressure on the lines suggested. The view is strongly held that it would be altogether unwise to embark upon any attempt to rid ourselves of the troublesome Court favourite unless we were thoroughly prepared to see the matter through.April 1, 1935.
