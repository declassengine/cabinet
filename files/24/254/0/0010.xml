(THIS DOCUMENT - IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S QOVERHMBMT).0 A B I N E T.USE OP COAL BURNING- STEAM VEHICLES ON ROADS,Memorandum by the Minister of Transport,SECRET. COPY NO .,tYf06CaC&quot;*55(35).For the last 30 years thero have been regulations limiting the total weight (vehicle plus load) which may normally be put upon the road by any mechanically-propelled vehicle. The steam vehicle has a large reserve of power and for many years the makers of these vehicles advertised them as capable of carrying loads involving a substantial excess over the total weight permitted by the statutory regulations.   In the last five years, action has been taken more frequently by the Police with a view to securing the observance of the maximum load regulations and prosecutions have been frequent.    Improved design has enabled the internal combustion engine, using potrol or oil fuel, te produce robust but relatively light vehicles which can carry a substantial load without infringing the maximalaid down for combined weight of vehicle and load.   The weight of the steam vehicle cannot be reduced to the same extent, with the result that its maximum &quot;pay load&quot; is less than that of the corresponding type of petrol or oil vehicle,2.     In two respects the steam vehicle has been preferentially treated.3*     Duty.    It long enjoyed a markedly advantageous scale of taxation.     The Salter Conference reported in 1932.-&quot;The present basis of contribution Is obviously in certain respects obsolete and inadequate.   More than half the contribution made by the owners of motor vehicles is now in the form of an 8d per gallon petrol duty.    Steam .e.
vehicles, whatever the weight and distance they travel, and though for a given weight and distance they are obviously responsible for at least an equal woar and tear of the roads, entirely escape this duty.     This is an anomaly which was not serious when the petrol duty was small but now clearly needs correction.&quot;(Report 55-170, para. 78). The&apos;Conference proposed substantial increases of duty.Taking as an example the vehicle of betweon 5 and 6 tonsunladen weight, with pneumatic tyros, the Oonferenco proposed increases of annual and licence duty:-from toin the case of (existing) (proposod)   Petrol vehicles 48 10&apos;8Fuel oil vehicles 48 188Steam vehicles 48 121The new scales as subsequently authorised by theFinance Acts did not by any means give full effect to these recommendations and the present comparable rates are:-exceeding 5 but not exceeding 6 tons  Petrol vehicles SOFuel oil vehicles 120Steam vehicles 904.     Gross Weight.   In 1931 a concession was made to four-wheeled steam vehicles then in existence allowing thorn to put upon the road a gross weight of 14 tons instead of the normal maximum of 12 tons, provided that their speed were limited to 12 miles per hour, while now steam vehicles on pneumatic tyres were allowed, without any special restriction as to speed, a total weight of 13 tins instead of 12 tons.5.     In spite of this assistance the former manufacturers of steam vehicles have one by one abandoned steam and turned
to the manufacture of pe-trol or oil fuel&quot; vehicles.    One firm only (the &quot;Sentinel&quot;) now survives.     Operators generally prefer to use petrol or oil for a number of reasons.     Supplies of those fuels are available anywhere in England and Wales, and those vehicles can he operated over substantial distances without re-fuelling.     The steam vehicle can only carry sufficient fuel to operate over a limited range, and the necessary fuel is stocked only at a very limited number of places.     Further, it is alleged that the operation of these vehicles is a dirtier business for the drivers than the operation of the petrol or oil vehicle.   These points cannot be overlooked in considering the falling off of the demand for these vehicles, the number of which has dropped from some 9,200 in 1926 to 6,800 in 1931, and to 2,400 in 1934 (the last available figures).     The declino in fact began long beforo the more stringent enforcement of weight limits.6.     My predecessors have repeatedly been pressed to grant further preferential troatment to steam vehicles and recently the Coal Utilisation Council, supported by the Commissioner for the Special Areas, has urged that some further concession In the matter of the maximum ladon weight allowed would be a &quot;simple and effective means of granting a definite measure of-v.protection to the coal trade ... in order to keep in employment a substantial number of men in one of the most seriously affected trades and in one of the worst employment areas in the country&quot;.     They ask that an additional two tons, and not one ton only, be allowed on any steam vehicle, irrespective of whether it is on four or six wheels and whether it draws a trailer or not.
7,      The steam vehicle, with the smoke and sparks which it emits, is not a particularly good neighbour on the roads. Users and manufacturers of other types of vehicles are not fairly treated if a particular type is indirectly subsidised and from the point of view cf the highway authority It is objectionable to give special concessions raising the maximum weight allowed on the roadsDIndeed, as a matter of road transport policy, I can see no justification for granting any further concession,      I am a little apprehensive that any such concession granted to the steam vehicle may be used as a lever by the manufacturers and operators of other classes of road vehicles to demand a higher maximum ladenweight in their case also.     They may well argue that if, for the sake of the coal industry, I am prepared to face the risk of damage to the roads by these higher loads, I might equally face the same risk in the interest of the road trans-port industry generally,8,      At the same time I recognise that the position of the coal industry is a matter of great concern (it is estimated that the 2.400 steam vehicles consume in the aggregate about 200,000 tons of coal a year thus affording emplojrment to 800 - 1,000 miners), and If, on grounds of public policy, it is considered: that a further concession should be made, I should not desire strongly to resist it.      The information before me suggests that even with such a concession, the steam vehicle is unlikely to hold its own, and that its disappearance&apos;can be but the matter of a few years.      At the moment it is no doubt suffering especially from the competition of the heavy oil vehicle,L. H-B.13th March s, 1935,
