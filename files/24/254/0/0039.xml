THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET, COPY NO,     &apos;i- ^O.P. 83(35).CABINET.PETROLEUM (PRODUCTION)  ACT,  1954. Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate for the information of my colleagues, a note setting out the more important provisions of the draft Regulations and model clauses governing the grant of licences under the Act.      In accordance with Section 6 (2) of the Act, the Regulations have to be laid &quot;before Parliament, and there is provision that they may he annulled by a resolution of either House during the next twenty-eight sitting days.A summary of the proposals has been shown confidentially to representatives of four of the more important British oil companies,  and has also been considered by a small Committee set up at the suggestion of the Secretary for Mines by the Council of the Institution of Petroleum Technologists.      It has been found possible to meet substantially the principal points made by the industry without affecting the main principles of our proposals.I would draw attention to paragraph 5 of the note which deals with applications from foreigners or foreign controlled companies.      In view of the considerations set out in the note,  I feel that we ought to admit applications on behalf of responsible foreign applicants,  subject to the safeguards indicated.      To attempt to exclude foreigners might have very serious effects on the interests of British oil companies now operating abroad.
Consideration has been given to the possibility of including a provision to enable action to be taken, if it were considered desirable at any time in the future,  to conserve, for purposes of defence,  any supplies of natural petroleum which may exist in this country.    This point has been considered, but for the following reasons I doubt whether it is practicable to take any step now to meet it.    It    may well be that at some future date the point will become of importance.    But to attempt to deal with it now before any oil has been found in this country would, I feel, discourage the search for, and development of, oil supplies.    The cost of carrying out a thorough search for oil in an unproved country is very large indeed,  and the venture is highly speculative.    Concerns which under the conditions to be imposed in the Regulations may be willing to sink large sums of money in this pioneer work might be less willing to do so if the Government retained the right, when oil had been found, to control their efforts to secure a return on their outlay.    It having been decided to rely on private enterprise to carry on the ; work of searching for and developing any oil which may exist, care must be taken not to hamper this enterprise by provisions which may never become a practical  issue.    If and when the question does arise, a&apos; large number of conflicting considerations will have to be weighed,  such as economic and exchange considerations,  the quality and character of the oil found,  the level of oil values, the potential productive capacity as compared with homes or &quot;defence&quot; consumption,  the estimated, life of -the wells, etc.If,  as a matter of policy,  a decision is taken later on, when oil  is discovered,  that it ought to be deliberately conserved in the ground,  the question must then be  considered, in the light of the facts available and in a manner fair to those who will have invested their capital and earned a measure of
success in a hazardous enterprise.    But the essential thing now in the national interest is to encourage those who are prepared to undertake the search,W.R.Board of Trade,12th April, 1935.
- salient features of the draft regulations and model glauses under . section&quot; 6 (1 )&quot; of the petroleum (production) act , 1954 .Types op licences.Licences will be of two kinds,   (a) Prospecting Licence. under which test drilling is permitted,  and  (b) Mining Licence., Period of Prospecbing Licence.It is proposed that the licence shall run for three years with two possible extensions of one year each.    It would carry the right at any time during its currency to the grant of a mining licence covering a part or parts of the prospecting area if the licensee satisfies the Secretary for Mines that he possesses or can secure adequate financial and technical resources, and has fulfilled the terms and conditions of the Prospecting Li acquiescence.Period of Alining Licence.It is proposed that the initial period should be 50 years with a renewal period of 25 years. Conditions governing applications.Each application must be accompanied by the following-pa rticulars:(i) In the case of an application by&quot;an individual his address,, nationality and occupation;  or if the applicant is a company,  the nature and place of business,,  the names and nationality of the directors,  ana the names and holdings of the principa1 shareholdars.(ii) a one-inch Ordnance survey map on which the boundaries of the area for which the licence is required are clearly shown.Separate licences should be applied for in respect of separate areas, but the Secretary for Mines may,  so long as the total area covered does not exceed the maximum prescribed for any licence,  issue  one licence to cover two or more separate areas.The applicant shall furnish evidence to the satisfaction of the Secretary for Mines as to his financial and technical qualifications and as to his ability to comply with such terms
and. conditions as the Secretary for Mines may attach,  on the basis of the model clauses,   to the grant of the licence applied for.5. Applications from foreigners and from, foreign-controller___companies._The  somewhat difficult question which arises here  is whether, and if so, with what safeguards,  applications shall be entertained from foreigners and from foreign-controlled companies.The Earl of Iddesleigh raised the question of principle by moving the following amendment on the Report stage of the Bill in the House of Lords.Clause 2, page 2? line 6,   at end insert -(&quot;&quot;Provided that a licence shall not be granted to or held by any nersons other than a British subject nor in the case of a body corporate unless membership and control thereof is limited to British subjects&quot;).In the course of his reply  (Official Report,  15th May,  1934, columns 401-402)  Lord Londonderry said -It is true that we are relying,  to a very large extent, on the regulations which can be made under Clause 6 of this Bill.    An opportunity will then ariseto discuss the matter,  and if Parliament considers that the regulations are not satisfactory they can be annulled.      The noble Earl,  I think,  desires a more drastic treatment of these provisions by the Amendment which he proposes to incorporate in the Bill.      I think the noble  Sari should not overlook the fact that if his Amendment were adopted we could hardly complain if other countries in different parts of the world,  whoown petroleum resources,  followed the same course and shut&apos;British enterprise out of territorie s where they are now operating to the advantage of this country and the iinpire.      Such a result could only make us more vdeoendent than we are now on supplies from Foreign countries.    I think the noble Earl will see that his object is probably best achieved by means of regulations under Clause 6?   and that instead of incorporating such a drastic suggestion as is contained in his Amendment,  the matter would best be dealt with by the means which we are proposing to adoot.&quot;
If it were decided that applications should be permitted from foreigners or foreign-controlled companies,  it is suggested that the following safeguards should be imposed,(2)    The  transfer or assignment of any licence shall besubject to the approval of the Secretary for Mines, but such approval shall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably withheld.,    In the case of a transfer to a foreigner or foreign-controlled company the necessary safeguards will come into force.(3)    A reciprocity provision,  i.e.  foreign capital only to be admitted in cases where foreigners are citizens of countries granting similar advantages to British nationals./jNote:    It is proposed that a clause somewhat on the lines of Section 12 of the United States Oil Leasing Act,  1920 should be  inserted in all licences thus providing the necessary right in the future to terminate existing licences if a country previously giving reciprocity, of which the licensee is a national,  changes its law//(4)    In the case of both foreign individuals and foreigncompanies a requirement to be imposed requiring the formation and maintenance in this country of an operating company.(5)    The majority of employees and at least one of the directors of the British registered Company to be British subjects.(6)    So long as the crude oil or products thereofobtained from the licensed area can be consumed in Great Britain or Northern Ireland,  the licensee shall if so required by the Secretary ensure that such crude oil or products thereof shall be sold only for consumption in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.    (This will necessarily involve the refining of the oil).(7)    The licence will include provisions designed toensure that the concession shall  in fact be worked.These   -safeguards are based on those approved in principle in 1930 as regards oil concessions in British territories.        Two other conditions were then included, the first of which read:-    &quot;Two years&apos;    notice
of a change of policy to he given to afford opportunity forBritish capital to secure concsssjons&quot;.It does not appearreasonable  to impose a condition of this kind in this country.since no change of policy is involved, inasmuch as there havehitherto been no restrictions here on the working of oil orother minerals by foreigners.Moreover, it is  suggested that.any provisions excluding foreigners until British companies had had a final chance of selecting areas  considered suitable would enable foreign countries  to say tnat our &quot;open door&quot; policy was a sham, and it might lead bo unfortunate repercussions elsewhere.The second condition redd,  &quot;The Government retain the right of pre-emption in case of emergency&quot; is not included as it is considered unnecessary to provide for this in this country In view of the general powers the Government would take immediately an emergency arose.With regard to condition (6) above,  the Oil Companies who have been consulted have suggested that this might be included, as in fact the provisions  designed to ensure working are to be Included, in all  licences.      The Companies have expressed the fear if this  safeguard were to be operative only in the case of a licence held by a foreigner,  that foreign countries will follow our example and require  companies to refine in the country of production when there may be very good reasons for not doing so.      To copy  one clause now suggested will no&quot;o do any harm because it rests on the existence of home market.      The point made by the companies is considered to be sound and nothing is lost by adopting the clause In the new form.6*        Pees  to be paid on application.Fees proposed:Prospecting Licence,  20.Mining Licence,  40.-a. -
7. Maximum size of area for any one Prospecting Licence.200 square miles. 8. Maximum size of area for any one Mining Licence.The Prospecting Licensee will have the right to take up an area or areas not exceeding in the aggregate one-half (i.e., not exceeding 100 square miles)  of the area held under his Prospecting Licence, hut the Secretary for Mines may at his discretion increase the proportion which the -licensee may so take up.9. Right of licensee to hold any number of licences.It is not proposed to have any limit to the number of separate licences which may be held by any one company or individual.10. Minimum size of prospecting and mining areas.It is proposed that no Prospecting Licence shall be granted for less than 8 square miles and no Mining Licence for less than 4 square miles.      It will be made clear that these minima shall not apply to any application for an additional area adjoining that already held under licence by the applicant.11. Shape of area.(a) Prospecting Licence.      The regulations will provide that the area shall be  reasonably compact and so far as possible follow well-defined natural boundaries,  and that the minimum width of any area shall be between l/3rd and l/5th of its length,  according to the size  of the area.(b) Mining Licence.      The regulations will contain  similar provisions as to the shape of the  area or areas to be selected for a Mining Licence.12. Working obligations - Prospecting Licence.The licensee will be required to carry out with due diligence during the currency of the licence a scheme of prospecting or development to be agreed with the Secretary for
380  IMines which will include the carrying out of a geological or geophysical survey and/or a programme of test drilling. 13.    Rate  of royalty on crud^ oil.The  rate contemplated as a basis for negotiations with prospective  licensees Is 4/Od. per ton, but as a result of the negotiations It may be necessary to accept a somewhat lower figure.It Is proposed only to prescribe minimum and maximum  rates in the model clauses to be laid before Parliament. 14.    Periodical revision of rate of royaIty.As an ad valorem basis is not being adopted for royalty purposes,  provision will be made for periodical revision to take account of any marked changes In the market value  of crude  oil and of Its principal products.        It is proposed that the first revision should not take place until 1950, and that revision thereafter should be made every 10 years.        The  revision would be by agreement or, failing agreement, by arbitration.      A proviso will be incorporated in the model clause providing for a maximum and minimum rate of royalty..       The rates it is proposed to adopt are 6/0d.  and 3/0d.&apos;per ton respectively. 15.  Scale of minimum annual payments  - Mining Licence.With a view to ensuring that licensees will carry out development work it is proposed to require the payment annually of substantial sums known as minimum annual payments or dead rents. The payments will increase annually up to the 10th year.    This provision is considered to be more  effective than the  imposition of drilling obligations.It Is proposed to negotiate with  prospective licensees onthe basis of thy following rates, although until negotiationsbegin it  is not possible to say whether5 these rates can be secured.(It is not proposed to mention any figures in the Model Clauses.)s . d . s .  d.1st year 1.3. per acre               6th year 5.  0. per acre2nd      &quot; 2.0. &quot; &quot;                  7th      &quot; 6.0. 11 &quot;3rd      &quot; 2.9. &quot; &quot;                 8th      n 7.  0. &quot; &quot;4th      &quot; 3.6. &quot; &quot;                  9th      &quot;  &apos; 8.  0. &quot;      115th      &quot; 4.3. &quot; 10th      &quot; 9.  0. &quot; &quot;These represent  40 per square mile at the minimum and  288per square mile at the maximum rate.
16. Pro vision of a &quot; stop&quot; in minimum annual payments.....if productivecapacity of wells is, low.&apos; * -In order to encourage licensees to secure the maximum recovery ox oil,  and in case oil wells in this country should be small producers,  it is proposed to insert a provision that the minimum annual payments shall not exceed that normally &apos; payable in the 5th year unless the total productive capacity of the wells  (on the basis of a. recognised, test)  in the licensed area is more than 400 tons per square mile per annum;    with a graduated scale of reductions thereafter according to the ascertained productive capacity of the wells in the area. ? &apos; Da ad. rejnt - P ros pj3 ct i nj  Li canoe .It is proposed to negotiate with prospective licensees on the basis of 10/- per square mile for the first year and  1 per square mile per annum thereafter,  payable in advance, with a minimum payment of  20 for the first year and  40 in the second and subsequent years for each licensed, area. 18. Royalty .on . o-aai-nghead j?,etro 1 e urn jspirit - Mining Licence.Until some experience is gained, of the circumstances likely to attend the recovery of casinghea,d petroleum spirit from natural gas,  all that can be said, at the present stage is that the royalty charge proposed under this heading is likely to approximate to the formula adopted in Trinidad.      In Trinidad at the present time royalty is fixed at -^d. per Imperial Gallon where the ca.singhead petroleum spirit recovered Is less than 2 Imperial Gallons per thousand cubic feet of gas treated,  and - d. per Imperial Gallon where the spirit content is 2 gallons and over per thousand cubic feet.It is proposed that whatever rates are finally fixed shoal&apos;!!, be subject to review at decennial periods in the same way as royalty on crude oil,  and that the minimum and maximum rates to be inserted in the Model Clause should be -grd.  and 2d. per Imperial Gallon respectively.
Royalty will only be charged on gas actually sold and noton any gas utilised in field operations.    During the ProspectingLicence period the proposed rate is 10fo of  the sale -price.20.Avoidance.....of ^Harmful^Method^ of Working and Damage to AdjoiningPetroleum^Bearlhg Strata^ , :      &apos;       -(1)  The Licensee shall maintain all apparatus appliancesboreholes and wells producing petroleum in good repair and condition and shall execute all operations in or inconnection with the licensed area in a proper andworkmanlike manner in accordance with methods and practice customarily used in good oilfield practice and without prejudice go the generality of theforegoing provision the Licensee shall   rtake allsteps practicable in order:(a) to control the flow and to prevent the escape orwaste of petroleum discovered in or obtained from the licensed area;  and(b) to conserve the licensed area;  for futureproductive operations;  and(c) to prevent damage to adjoining petroleumbearing strata; and(d) to prevent the entrance of water through boreholesand wells to petroleum bearing strata; and(e) to prevent ths escape  of petroleum into anywater-well spring stream river lake reservoir estuary Or harbour.(2)- The Licensee shall comply with any instructions from timeto time given by the Secretary relating to any of thematters set out in paragraph (1) hereof.21.    Unit Development of an Oil Structure, or Oilfield^1.  If at any time it is established to the satisfaction of theSecretary for Mines that more than one licence has been granted under the Act in respect    of the same geological oil structure oroilfield, and the Secretary for Mines considers that it is in thenational interest that the said structure or oilfield should be operated as a unit,  the Licensee undertakes if called upon to do
so &quot;by the Secretary for Mines to co-operate with the other Licensees affected with a view to the preparation, within a period of months, or within such longer period as theSecretary for Mines may allow,  of a co-operative or unit plan of development or operation of the said oil structure or oilfield by the separate Licensees affected.2.      In the event of the Licensees failing to agree upon a plan, or if the plan submitted is not approved by the Secretary for Mines,  the Licensee undertakes to agree to conform to such plan as the Secretary for Mines,  after consultation with all the Licensees concerned,  may prescribe to secure the effective unit development or operation of the said oil structure or oilfield. Before settling the plan the Secretary for Mines shall permit any Licensee who may desire to do  so to be heard in relation to the terms and conditions of the plan.    In the event of licensees not being-satisfied that the scheme as proposed is fair and equitable as between the  several Licensees,  provision will be made for the matters at issue to be referred to an independent person or tribunal..3.      In the event of a Licensee failing to observe the provisions of a plan or of any special conditions of working prescribed in accordance with these provisions,   the Secretary for Mines shall have the right to cancel the    Licence, Provision of storage tanks,  pipes,  pipelines,   etc.No gas or oil shall wilfully be permitted to escape or be otherwise wasted,  but all means commercially practicable shall be used for confining the gas or oil from the  licenced area within properly constructed tanks, pipes,  pipelines or other safe and proper receptacles,  and no oil shall, except as a temporary measure during an emergency,  be placed or kept in an earthen reservoir.    All steps commercially practicable shall be taken to  see that such tanks,  pipes,  pipelines and receptacles are maintained in good repair so as to prevent leakage of gas
23* Protection of Goal Seams and Coal and Other Mineral Workings.Any borehole penetrating any mine or any workable seam of coal shall be cased in such a manner as to shut ofl any water or petroleum in the borehole, from entering such mine or workable seam of coal.24- Disposal of Waste Oil, Salt Water or Refuse.The Licensee shall drain all waste oil, salt water or refuse from tanks gas holders boreholes and wells into proper receptacles erected and maintained by him for that purpose at a safe distance from such tanks gas holders boreholes and wells and from any buildings or structures whether situate within the  licensed area or not and shall dispose of such waste oil and refuse in manner from time  to time approved by the Secretary,      The Licensee shall not cause or permit any waste oil or refuse to flow into or over or to be deposited upon any land, whether situate within the licensed area or not,25.    Preservation of Amenities.The Licensee shall carry out all operations witnin tne licensed area in such a manner as not to interfere unnecessarily with the amenities of the locality in which the licensed area is situate.26&apos; Health.....and Safety of Workers and Employees,The Licensee shall comply with any instructions from time to time given by the Secretary for Mines for securing the health and safety of workers employed in or about the licensed area, 27, Reports,  etc.,  to be treated as confidential.All records, plans, maps, accounts and information which the Licensee is or may be from time to time required to furnish
under the provisions of the licence  shall be supplied at the Licensee&apos;s own expense and shall (except with the consent of the Licensee which shall not be unreasonably withheld) be treated by the Secretary for Mines as confidential.      The Secretary for Mines shall nevertheless be entitled at any time to make use of any information received from the Licensee for the purpose of preparing and publishing aggregated returns and general reports on the extent of operation under the Act. 28. .Advertisements, Prospectuses;  etc.(l) No statement shall be made either in any notice,advertisement, prospectus or other document issued by or to the knowledge of the Licensee or in any other manner claiming or suggesting whether expressly or by implication,  that His Majesty or any Government Department or any person or body acting on behalf of His Majesty has or have expressed or formed any opinion that the licensed area is,  from its geological formation or otherwise,  one  in which petroleum is likely to be obtainable. (2) The foregoing provisions or a statement to the effect thereof shall be included in or indorsed on any prospectus,  statement in lieu of prospectus, notice, circular, advertisement or other invitation issued by or to the knowledge of the Licensee offering to the public for subscription or purchase any shares or debentures of a company or intended company. 29. Power of Revocation.If and whenever the rents and royalties hereby reserved or any part  thereof shall be in arrear for two calendar months next after any of the days whereon the same ought to have-been paid or if there shall be any breach or non-observance by the Licensee of any of the terms and conditions herein contained the Secretary may revoke this Licence and thereupon
the same and all the rights hereby granted shall cease and determine but subject /nevertheless and without prejudice to any obligation or liability imposed or or incurred under the terms and conditions hereof.Right-;-, ot Lice ns ee t   De te rm i ne Lie en c e or to Abandon Ppj^tions of &quot;Fhe Lieensed&quot; Area.^At any time during the continuance of the Licence theLicensee may determine the Licence before the date on whichit is due to expire, by giving to the Secretary fox&quot; Mines atleast 3 calendar months&apos;  notice in writing to that effectprovided that the determination of this Licence shall notabsolve the Licensee from any obligation or liability imposed by or incurred under the terms and conditions of the Licence.Upon the application of the Licensee the Licensee may fromtime to time by giving two calendar months&apos;  notice in writing to the Secretary for Mines abandon the right granted by theLicence in respect of any portion of the incensed areasubject to any obligation or liability incurred under theterms and conditions of the licence.S ecurfty^On the execution of the Licence,  the Licensees shall deposit with the Secretary for Mines as security a sum of in the case of a Prospecting Licence  6 and in the case of a Mining Licence  20 for each square mile,  or part of a square mile,  of the area covered by the Licence,  or furnish a bond or bankers&apos;  guarantee for the same amount,  subject to a minimumi deposit or bond or bankers1  guarantee of in the case of a Prospecting Licence  400 and in the case of a Mining-Licence  1,000.      In the event of the Licensee failing to carry out any of the obligations contained in the Licence in connection with safety precautions,  the plugging of boreholes, the maintenance of measuring appliances,  and the px-event ion of waste of oil and gas and of damage to oil
deposits or water supplies, the Secretary for Mines reserves the right to carry out any work -which may he reasonably necessary to secure the above objects and to recover the cost from the Licensee^32o    Power of Distress.Provision will be made to allow the Secretary for Mines to enter upon lands covered by the Licence for the purpose of distraining all or any stocks of crude oil and gas, refined products, engines, plant etc., if payments due in respect of rents or royalties are outstanding after a stated period.33 o   Arbitration Clause.If at any time hereafter any dispute difference or question shall arise between the Secretary and the Licensee touching the construction meaning or effect of this Licence or any clause or matter herein contained or any instruction given by the Secretary or the rights or liabilities of the Secretary and Licensee respectively under this Licence or otherwise howsoever in relation to the premises, then every such dispute difference or question shall, save where it is expressly provided by this Licence that the matter or thing to which the same relates shall be determined or decided by the Secretary or the Licensee, be referred to the arbitration of two independent persons,  (one to be appointed by the Secretary and the other by the Licensee), who shall have power in case of disagreement between them to appoint an umpire. The provisions of this clause shall be deemed to be a submission to arbitration by the said parties hereto under the Arbitration Acts 1889 to 1934- or any statutory modification or re-enactment thereof for the time being in force, and the provisions thereof shall accordingly apply as far as applicable.(Signed)    Ernest Brown. -13-
