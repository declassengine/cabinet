u y (7Printed - for the Cabinet.   April 1935.SECRET. Copy No.    41CP. 80 (35).CABINET.THE FAR EAST.I WISH to draw the attention of my colleagues to the despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo which is printed below. It contains, in my opinion, an excellent presentation of some of the most important aspects of the Far Eastern problem.J. S.[F 1090/483/23]Sir R. Clive to Sir John Simon. (Received February 19.) (No. 8.   Confidential.)Sir, Tokyo, January 7, 1935.A RECENT article in a Japanese periodical referred to Mr. Hirota&apos;s conception of diplomacy as &quot; a policy of harmony in place of the former policy of agreement.&quot; In March 1935 Japan will cease to be a member of the League of Nations, and there is no doubt that the present Foreign Minister rightly interprets the feeling of the county when he declares his preference for bilateral arrangements with individual countries in place of regional agreements, or still more comprehensive pacts.2. At the beginning of 1934 there were two agreements to which Japan was a party and to which she had the strongest objection the Washington Naval Treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty. Notice of abrogation of the former was given in Washington on the 29th December, while a mortal blow may have been struck at the latter by the prospective oil monopoly in Manchukuo. Moreover, the now famous statement of the Foreign Office spokesman of the 17th April claiming for Japan to be the sole arbiter whether any particular activity of a foreign Power or individual in China were prejudicial to peace and order in that country was so clearly incompatible with the spirit of the treaty that assurances on the subject were at once requested by the three Great Powers mainly interested, Great Britain, the United States of America and France. The reply, though evasive, was perforce accepted as adequate.3. Japan&apos;s recent history may be divided into periods of aggressive activity followed by periods of relative calm, but it is instructive to note that underlying the calm has always been, a fixed determination to reculer pour mieuoo sauter. Every Japanese believes that the action of the three Powers, Russia, France and Germany, in robbing Japan of the fruits of her victory over China in 1895 by refusing to allow her claim to the Liaotung Peninsula, directly led to the Russo-Japanese war of 1904.4. The violence of Chinese resentment at the Shantung clause of the Treaty of Versailles made it morally certain that the rights and privileges which Japan had seized in that province could not permanently be retained. This, coupled with the failure of the Siberian expedition, brought the military party into discredit, and paved the way for Japanese acceptance of the Nine-Power Treaty and the other Washington Treaty in 1922. It would therefore be absurd to pretend that the military party ever assented to the policy enshrined in those 7907   [11454]
treaties or willingly accepted the obligations imposed by the former. Nine years elapsed, however, before the army felt strong enough to break with the policy of conciliation and startle the world by the coup d&apos;Etat at Mukden in September 1931, which led to Japan&apos;s severing her connexion with the League and setting up the State of Manchukuo., 5. The reaction in Europe and the United States to the Mukden coup and to the Shanghai incident which shortly followed produced in Japan a form of dementia from which she has, at the end of 1934, not yet wholly recovered. The Lytton report and the threat of sanctions gave rise to a fit of intensive nationalism, combined with a mood of angry defiance. That this phase has not yet run its course is shown by the Amau statement of the 17th April, the provocative pamphlets issued by the War Department during the year and the denunciation of the Washington Naval Treaty. The defensive measures now being adopted by foreign countries to check the flood of Japanese imports have not contributed to restore calm to the national consciousness.6. English critics of Japan are wont to judge this country by the standards of Western Europe and it is perhaps natural that they should if they have never lived in the Far East, but the resulting argument may be based on a fundamental misconception. I believe this is true of an otherwise excellent and well-reasoned article by Lord Lothian which has been quoted in one of the Japanese papers from the Observer of the 18th November. The article was based on the references to the Pacific in General Smuts&apos;s speech early in November. In it Lord Lothian argues that only by Great Britain and the United States standing together to strengthen the moderate elements against the militarists can the peaceful Pacific system created at Washington in 1922 be maintained, whereby the affairs of the Far East are settled by agreement and not by force.7. Now, although Japan has a free press and a system of parliamentary government based on our own with two main political parties, the assumption that there is a peaceful and a warlike party, a pro-military and an anti-military party, is absolutely incorrect. It was the relative weakness of the Japanese fighting forces in the decade following the war that was responsible for the so-called policy of conciliation, and the endeavour to work in harmony with the spirit of the League. That policy is now believed to have been a failure, and no Japanese political party to-day supports it. China interpreted it as weakness. The United States wallowing in prosperity, Western Europe overwhelmed with the problems of post-war recovery, were lulled into the belief that the policy which had inspired the twenty-one demands was dead, and that Japan, a signatory of the Nine-Power and Washington Treaties, was a genuine convert to international disarmament and the philosophy of peace preached by the League. A very instructive commentary on the real feeling of the Japanese at that time is supplied in a statement to the press on the 29th December by the Foreign Office spokesman, who had himself been a secretary in the Japanese delegation at the Washington Conference. &quot;President Harding,&quot; he says, &quot;announced the opening of the conference, and Secretary of State Hughes made the famousbomb-shell proposal of the 5:5:3 ratio.....Admiral Kato continued his fight against the shameful ratio, while Baron Shidehara and Mr. Hanihara undertookthe negotiations on Pacific problems.....   The Japanese delegation returnedhome with the treaty on the 14th February. On the journey Admiral Kato was more silent than before. The Taiyo Maru reached Yokohama on the 10th March. Since that date the abrogation of the treaty was secretly considered in the minds of the Japanese people.&quot;8. The veil, however, was not lifted until the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents of 1931-32 brought Japan fully into the limelight. When Japanese statesmen appear to insult our intelligence by reiteration of the phrase that it is Japan&apos;s mission to preserve peace in the Far East in contradiction to what strikes us as the obvious facts, I do not believe this to be a mere empty figure of speech. Japan unquestionably believes in her destiny, and that is to be, and to remain, the dominant Power in the East. If the world is prepared to accept Japan at her own valuation peace will be preserved. Otherwise Japan accepts no responsibility for any breach that may occur. The business world, the Court, the civilian departments, most certainly do not want war, but it would be self-deception to suppose that they would constitute a determined opposition to the militarists if the ordered course of Japan&apos;s destiny were in danger.
9. Should Japan, this year or next, not feel strong enough against combined Anglo-American pressure to resist appending her signature to a treaty she did not like, I believe the future would be fraught with danger if we are to judge1 by the precedent of history. In my humble opinion, British interests in the 17ar East and in the Continent of Asia are too great to justify a policy of standing in solidly under all circumstances with the United States to oppose Japan. Apart from the Philippines, which she is determined to be quit of, American interests in Asia and the East are purely commercial, and her action, to judge again by historical precedent, is never likely to go beyond the. writing of notes in order to defend the integrity of China. Japan&apos;s pan-Asia ideas are of vital interest to Great Britain. To the United States this interest is little more than academic. Moreover, is it certain that a naval agreement between Great Britain and the United States in opposition to Japan would be so warmly welcomed in America? The New York Tribune of the 28th November, referring to the naval conversations in London, says: &quot;British opinion of the question [Japanese denunciation of the Washington Naval Treaty] is divided, and it is by no means sure that the British will side with the Americans rather than with the Japanese. British interests are not identical with American. ; A definite naval agreement between America and England, apart from its advantages, would impose obligations on America in the sense that it would imply the underwriting by Americans of British interests in the Pacific. That would be a large order. The most that can be hoped for is that during the next few years the British will use their good offices to induce the Japanese to keep down naval construction.&quot;10 I entirely agree with the assumption of the New York Tribune, namely, that Great Britain, relying on an historic and partly sentimental friendship, is in a better position to exercise a moderating influence over Japan than a combination of British and American pressure.11. The influence of sentiment in international relations is like one of those rare and delicate plants which flower at irregular intervals and appear in between to lie dormant, if not to be actually dead. The sentimental affection of the United States for Erance, thanks to the memory of Lafayette, of Bulgaria for Russia, of United Italy for England, has its counterpart in Japanese feeling towards Great Britain. Since the date of the Washington Treaties, the old feeling of goodwill appeared almost to have died. In 1934, however, there were faint signs of life. So far it has gone no further than general expressions of friendliness and an expressed desire for more intimate relations. But there has been a crescendo of such expressions since I arrived here-offer of non-aggression pact, desire for political understanding, enthusiasm about the Federation of British Industries mission, pointed references to the former alliance, and gratitude for the sympathetic attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment during the naval conversations, but more precise expression was given to it in a recent conversation with the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, an outspoken realist with very little sentiment in his make-up. He referred to the document which I had been instructed to communicate officially from the Admiralty to the Ministry of Marine relating to the safeguards adopted in the construction of warships. I had already received ah official note of thanks. Mr.. Shigemitsu said the Japanese Government had been deeply impressed by the spirit of friendship actuating the Admiralty. The feeling had grown up since,, the abrogation of the alliance at the time of the Washington Treaties that Great Britain had renounced her ancient friendship for Japan. A year or two later the decision had been made to construct the Singapore Dock. This, it was felt, would&apos;never have been done had the old feeling towards Japan persisted. Then in 1927, during the Shanghai troubles, His Majesty&apos;s Government had shown no desire to co-operate with Japan, but had acted independently. Finally, there was the Lytton report and the unsympathetic attitude towards Japan&apos;s difficulties in Manchuria, culminating in the hostile vote at Geneva.12. Mr. Shigemitsu made it clear that his country had been suffering under a sense of grievance until, in 1933, His Majesty&apos;s Government at last began to show signs, he said, of understanding the Japanese point of view. The Vice-Minister, it should be noted, made no reference to our economic disputes. His remarks were based on the plane of political friendship.. It was that Which he wished to see restored.
13. I still believe that neither the Minister nor the Vice-Minister has any-very definite idea of the form they would like this political friendship to take, and, from our point of view, there are obvious questions to be answered : How to account for the unfriendly oil policy both in Japan and Manchuria, the very unsympathetic attitude of the army as displayed in the recent pamphlets, the distraint on British perpetual leaseholders for municipal taxation in dispute. Again, is this Japanese desire for friendship mere sentiment and anxiety to repair a temporary estrangement, or is it a deliberate policy to avoid isolation when Japan cuts herself off from the League next March, and will later have to take part in the Naval Conference ? My own impression is that it is a combination of these, and that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government continue to react to their advances (the general impression is that His Majesty&apos;s Government were as helpful as could be expected over the recent naval conversations), the Japanese Government may be more conciliatory over the oil and other questions, including-the naval question and those in China where British interests are concerned, but in any case the Japanese return is likely, for some time to come, to be more negative than positive, and it is essential to realise this.14. My predecessor wrote in last year&apos;s annual report as follows: &quot;My own view is that our policy in the Far East should be based, as in the past, onthe principle of friendship with Japan.....But if this principle is accepted,it must be with our eyes open. It is not possible to work on it with success unless, we accept the corollary that in the Far East Japan comes first and America second.&quot;15. I have no hesitation in saying that I agree with Sir Francis Lindley&apos;s view, and I do so for the following reasons : (1) As I have said above, I believe combined Anglo-American pressure would defeat the end in view by antagonising Japan, inflaming her complex of defiance and stimulating her pan-Asia activities.(2) I do not think we are justified on the basis of precedent in relying on continued American support. We should risk incurring the odium of this policy without any compensating advantages, and it is Great Britain which has far more to lose in the Far East than the United States.(3) Close relations with Japan in no way imply a policy of antagonism to any other country, notably the United States, the U.S.S.R. or China. On the contrary, it is to be hoped that they may enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to act as a moderating influence without provoking Japanese resentment.I have, &amp;c.R. H. CLIVE.o
