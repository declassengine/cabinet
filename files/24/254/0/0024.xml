The CaLinet;  at their meeting held on the 20th March, 1935 (Cabinet 16(35)  Conclusion 3)  instructed us to examine the strategic aspects of the Japanese offer to the Govern-merit of the Portuguese Colony of Macao to buy a large concession there,  including the development of the new inland&apos; port.2.      As instructed &quot;by the Cabinet, we consulted with the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office and we had the advantag of the presence of Sir John Maffey and Mr. Orde at our meeting since it was apparent that the strategic, political and economic implications of the Japanese offer were very closely interlocked.Japanese offer tom the Government_of the Portuguese Colony.3o      we were informed by the Colonial Office that the Japaneaeoffer was for a contract -(i)    to build a waterworks at a cost of $1,500,000;(ii)    to purchase the whole site of a new inland port (for several million dollars cash);(iii)    to establish and operate a line of 2,000 toncargo steamers to run between Hong Kong - Canton -Timor;(iv)    to pay off existing debts of established industries.S E ORE T.

n q&amp; so4.      it was further stated that,  in the opinion of the Macao Government, this offer,  if accepted, would mean prosperity for that Colony although the fear was expressed that it might also mean virtually Japanese control of the territory.      Some further details are given in an appendix to the report.Strategic aspects.5.      Macao is approximately 40 miles from Hong Kong and,  it is claimed3  has excellent aerodrome sites.      It would,  therefore, be of considerable value to the -Japanese from the point of view of attacks on Hong Kong in the event of war with this  country, more particularly as a base for fighter aircraft for the purpose of obtaining air superiority over the Hong Kong area. 6.      Fighter aircraft,  ifthey could not be flown direct to Macao,  could be flown off aircraft carriers to previously prepared landing grounds at the beginning of hostilities.    Other types of aircraft could,  if required,   fly direct to Macao from Japanese bases in Formosa, which is only just over 400 miles away, 7.      The acquisition of air facilities at Macao by the Japanese would necessitate the reconsideration of our existing air strength at Hong Kong.      If our air garrison was sufficiently strong s  we should be  in a position to dominate Macao from the outset and it would, therefore, be of little value to Japan as an air base.      Without an adequate air garrison at Hong Kong, however,  the converse would apply.8.      If the Japanese were  to establish themselves at Macao it would be necessary to review also the scale of anti-aircraft equipment at present provided for Hong Kong, and another point to be taken into account is the fact that the sea routes along which the Navy must pass to reach or operate from Hong Kong would be within short range of shore-based air attack. 9.      The sites in South China from which air action against . Hong Kong and the adjacent sea routes has up to the present been anticipated are Swatow,  Suabue and pinghoi,  some 180, 70
and 50 miles respectively.      These sites are all near the sea and offer facilities for the landing of stores and the development of air bases.      They are,  however, all unprepared and would take some time to develop,      Since these sites are all in Chinese territory, Japan would be unable to make preparations without  obtaining concessions from China, which, in present circumstances, would seem unlikely.      There are, therefore,  no alternative places which Japan could easily develop within a convenient range for attacks on Hong Kong by air,  and if it is possible to sterilise her attempt to obtain a footing in Macao we shall increase  considerably the security of Hong Kong.10.    Coastal or other fast motor boats operating from Macao would also be a source of considerable danger1 to our Fleet moored in Hong Kong.      These boats can be assembled, unobtrusively   and operated without all the previous preparation required for an air base.      Wo anti-Coastal Motor Boat boom is at present included in the Hong Kong defences and it would be a costly addition.The Western entrance of Hong Kong harbour is over two miles wide and the waters to Macao,  40 miles distant,  are comparatively sheltered.Economic Considerations.11.    Macao could not replace Hong Ifong as a principal deep sea portj but the harbour could, w.L th some dredging,  be made fit to take ships up to 5,000 tons,  which would probably lead to  the diversion from Hong Kong of much coastal Japanese and other shipping.      Furthermore,  recently reclaimed areas are available for an aerodrome which might be used in furtherance of Japanese,  and to the prejudice of British, commercial aviation interests.
12.      Once the Japanese became established at Macao, they would have a valuable stepping-off place for the expansion of commercial activities in South China.      There are distinct signs that  efforts are being made to establish Japanese interests in Central and Southern China in those areas in which hitherto British interests have been predominant.      Any successful Japanese activities- in this area would almost certainly react unfavourably on the economic position of Hong Kong.13.      In this connection the active interest which Japan is taking in proposals for the creation of an inland port at Honam Island is not without significance.      In January, 1935, Japanese agents approached the Canton authorities with an offer of several million dollars for the whole site.        The Chinese authorities are anxious to refuse this offer, however,  and have invited British interests in Hong Kong to ta-ce up what  amounts to a mortgage of an essential part of the property.      Any establishment of Japanese vested interests in the vicinity of Canton would have very serious effects on British trade and on our security in Hong Kong, possibly even greater than could arise out of the Japanese occupation of Macao.14.      The extension of Japanese influence in the area of Southern or Central China would be bound to reactadversely on our interests in every respect and is, there-Japanese political influence goes hand in hand with Japanese commercial activity, the local Chinese, if subservient to Japan, would not be in a position to offer us that assistance which a friendly neutral could.Political considerations.15. it is realised that British policy in the Far Last aims at friendly relations both with China and Japan,fore, extremely undesirable.In particular,  since
&amp; o jlwhile at the same time endeavouring to safeguard British interests.16.      It would appear to us, however, that it is just as much in the interests of Portugal to preventthe Japanese obtaining control of Macao as itis to the advantage of His&apos;Majesty&apos;s Government, furthermore&quot;, we understand that the Portuguese government do attach great Importance to maintaining their concession.It will be recalled  that  in 1927 the Portuguese Governmentdefinitely requested that our forces at Hong Kong mightbe made available, in certain circumstances,  to assistthe Governor of Macao to maintain the integrity of histerritory in case of  severe civil disturbance or riotswhich it was anticipated might be caused by Communista activities.17.      His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed that this assistance might be afforded on the strict understanding that the requirements of Hong Kong could be fully met.18.      It is further understood that the Portuguese Government ore financially in a favourable position and that they might, in consequence, quite well afford to take action themselves to assist the Governor of the Colony.-v.19.      If however the Portuguese cannot be induced to do so it might pay us in the long run to help the Portuguese at Macao to keep out the Japanese,  such expense being offset against  the loss which would undoubtedly arise to the interests of Hong Kong if Japan became firmly established at  the former place.
*) q q* -O *vSummary.20.    It would be to our great disadvantage on all grounds that Japan should obtain any controlling- interests in the Portuguese concession of Macao.    On strategic grounds the main clanger to Hong Kong is air attach by shore-based air-craft,  and if Japan became established in Macao in time of peace she would be able to create  an air base within forty miles of Hong Kong for use in war without violating Chinese neutrality.    There are other sites within striking distance of Hong Kong from which shore-based aircraft could be operated, but they are at present unprepared and undeveloped and, moreover,  are on Chinese territory,  and there might therefore be difficulties in Japan taking any action in time of peace.21.    If Japan was  to establish herself in Macao it would be necessary to review the existing scale of air and. ground defences in Hong Kong, because unless we were  strong enough to neut.ra.lise completely any Japanese air forces located at Macao,  severe damage could be inflicted in time of war on installations at the naval base,  and the use of the anchorage might be denied by air action alone.    The difficulties in relieving the fortress,  if attacked, would also be materially increased.    In addition it would assist in estab ii shine ht of air superiority in connection with a landing.The fleet in Hong Kong harbour would also be vulnerable^ to Coastal or other motor boat attack from Macao,  a distance of 40 miles across comparatively sheltered water.    Defence against this form of attack would be difficult and costly. 22.    From an economic aspect it is undesirable that Japan should, acquire a concession which might provide her with an outlet to South China,  and thus be in a position to operate in direct conflict with our commercial interests  in Hong Kong.    In any case the extension of Japanese influence in Central or South China,  which could only be at our expense, is strongly to be deprecated.    Political and commercial
9% u 0influence in China, would certainly be turned by Japan to full account not only in war, but in preparation for war, and our security would thereby be  seriously prejudiced. 23.    It would appear to be just as much to the interests of the Portuguese as to ourselves to prevent the Japanese from obtaining control of Macao,  and as the &quot;Portuguese Government are understood to be financially in an excellent position, there would appear prima facie to be no reason why they should not afford such assistance as the Governor of Macao desires.    The point should not be overlooked, however, that if Portuguese assistance were not forthcoming it might in the long run pay us to give help because any such outlay might more than make up for the loss which would undoubtedly ensue from any Japanese commercial operations in this area.Pec ornme nd a t i on.24.    It has been pointed out at the beginning of this Report that it was found impossible  to separate  the strategic, political and economic considerations of the Japanese attempts to obtain concessions in Macao.    We hesitate to put forward recommendations haying &quot;a political bearing, but as a result of our consultations with Mr.  Orde and Sir John Maffey we would submit for consideration that in the first instance His Majesty&apos;s Government might review the possibility of an approach to the Portuguese Government,  with a view to that Government itself taking steps to prevent the intrusion of Japanese interests, in the Macao concession.    Any subsequent action which might be desirable or possible would, appear to depend on the results of such approaches.(Sd.)    ERNIE CHATPIELD.E.L.ELLINGTON.J.G.DILL.Maj: Gen: (for C. I.G.

U) 0 LkAPPENDIX.SUMMARY m RE GLUT JAP MI, Sg..; ACT IV IT IE S AT MACAO.1. The present  opportunity for commercial penetration,of which the Japanese are seeking to avail themselves, arises! from the bad financial condition of the Macao -waterworks. For some years the operation of these works has been in the hands of the (Portuguese) Colonial Government, though the Waterworks Company has not actually been dissolved or declared bankrupt.      One result of this has been the creation of a debt of some  100,000, owed by the Waterworks Company to  the Macao Colonial  Government.2. In January 1935 the Governor of Macao took stepsto inform the Hong Kong Colonial Government that he had been approached by Japanese interests with an offer to take over and improve the operation of the waterworks.The Governor of Macao  is stated to be anti-Japanese,    and his reason for informing the Hong Kong Government was to [j give British interests an opportunity of countering the Japanese move.3. On 22nd February the Japanese agent in charge ofthe negotiations presented a further petition to the Macao Government, detailing an offer to take over the waterworks on even more favourable terms than those previously quoted. The offer includes repayment  of existing debts to the     -v Government and to shareholders.      Other inducements, unconnected with the waterworks,  include the  establishment of new industries - e.g.  an alcohol plant and sugar refinery - in Macao, and the institution of a new Japanese steamship service between Hong Kong, Canton, Timor and Portuguese India.
c&apos;? y(j 0 JThe Japanese Consul-General at Hong Kong is  stated to be acting as guarantor of the above offers.4. In the meantime a British Syndicate has beeninvestigating the possibility of taking over the Macao -waterworks.      They estimate that a sum of about  150,000 will be&apos;required to finance the  project.    On approaching the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation,  they -were informed that  such an advance could not be considered without the guarantee of the Hong Kong Colonial Government. 5. The position on the 8th March was that theGovernor of Macao had reported to Lisbon that both Japanese and British interests were negotiating to ta-ce over the waterworks.    He had refrained from reporting details of the  latest Japanese offer,  in the hope that an acceptable British offer would mat oriari se.He is, however, fully aware that the Japanese scheme might lead to a  considerable increase in the prosperity of his Colony and, should a British offer not mature in the near future, he will be compelled to overcome his fear of eventual Japanese control of Macao, and recommend acceptance of the Japanese proposals.
