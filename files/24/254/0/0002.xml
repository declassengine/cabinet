THIS DOCUMENT 16 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.r? qSECRET. Oop^NOj____1^0.P.  47  (55)CABINET.RUSSIAN TIMBER.Memorandum by the president of the Board of Trade.(l) As was the case a year ago,  I have received protests from Mr. Bennett (through the High Commissioner for Canada) on the subject of Russian timber, for which a contract has recently been concluded between the White Sea Timber Trust and Timber Distributors Limited;      The questions at issue are difficult.      This note briefly describes the situation and indicates the action I propose to take.(2) Timber Distributors Ltd.   (a syndicate representing 200 importers of timber into the United Kingdom) has concluded, a contract for underwriting the purchase of 400,000 standards of sawn soft wood (mainly for building purposes) from Russia in 1935.      The contract includes a clause allowing for a rise or fall in the agreed prices (the fall is limited) to correspond with fluctuations in comparable Swedish or Finnish timber.    Last year the proposed contract covered 435,000 standards,  and included a rise and fall clause.      There was then no commercial agreement with Russia.      The Canadian Government protested that the contract would &quot;frustrate the preference&quot; on timber accorded to Canada at Ottawa,  and called on us to take action under Article 21 of the United Kingdom-Canada Agreement.      They particularly objected to the &quot;fall&quot; clause as likely to depress prices.    We informed Timber Distributors that if the quantity was reduced to 350,000 standards and the &quot;fall&quot; clause remove!, we should not feel obliged to take action.    The Canadian Governmen
accepted this as fulfilling our obligations, and a new contract was negotiated on these lines,,(3) I must confess that I have little sympathy with the Canadian case this year on merits,      Canadian imports of timber have increased five-fold in the last two years,-1932 00ocoo0oo,    66.000 standards (5% of total imports)19 33     8003000000     183 j 000 &quot;1934 0000000000  328,000 &quot;        (17% &quot;      &quot; &quot; ).Canadian prices have been ridiculously low;    and there are many complaints of the quality   and sizes of Canadian timber,      Russian prices have been consistently higher and her imports into this market have been considerably reduced.(4) Nevertheless,   the Canadian Government can put a case which it is difficult to meet so long as the &quot;fall&quot; clause is in the contract.     Last year, when stocks were low and prices rising, we restricted the contract to 350,000 standards,  and insisted on the deletion of the &quot;fall&quot; clause0 This year,  stocks are higher and prices are   falling;    and we cannot count on a larger consumption than last year0      In these circumstances, it is difficult to justify the contract, particularly if there is a &quot;fall&quot; clause,(5) I have suggested to the Soviet Government,  informally and unofficially,  through the Soviet Trade Representative here that they might wish to avoid controversy by themselves amending the contract to bring it into line with that of last year, -v This they feel unable to do,(6) One course open to us is to take the Canadian   protest at its face value and to give notice to the Russian Government that we have reason to believe that the contract creates prices which are &quot;likely to frustrate&quot; the preference accorded to Canada.        (i do not think anything is to be gained by referring the question to the Import Duties Advisory Committee,  as was
proposed last year : the considerations involved are not considerations of facts and figures.)   But before deciding to give such notice to the Soviet Government, we must recognise that our action may be of little practical value to Canada, and that its consequences may be embarrassing to use(V) It might result in the abandonment by Russia of the bulk contract. This course might commend Itself to them for several reasons(a) It would obviate questions as to the total quantity for the year until the season was well advanced.(b) By selling on the usual commercial lines they would remove any complaints that the bulk contract saturates the market at the beginning of the year.(c) The position of Russian timber is now so strong that they will probably sell without difficulty the 400,000 standards,  if not more,(d) Unless they deliberately undersold (which is improbable in view of the demand for Russian timber) no criticism could be levelled at their prices.(e) The absence of a bulk contract would make the position much more difficult for their competitors including Canada.(f) The British Government would find it difficult to take any immediate action against Russian timber. Ultimate action would depend on comparisons between Russian and Canadian prices and in this respect the advantage Is at present very much on the Russian side.(6) The disadvantages to the Russians of this course are probably slight.    Several years ago the contract was more advantageous to them, particularly from the financial point ofview, as the contract was a useful security on which to obtainadvances from the Timber Brokers.    The Russian financialposition is now much stronger and they have recently taken topurchasing for cash. Outstanding Russian commitments with theExport Credits Guarantee Department for 1935 amount to  2^million, as against more than  6 million twelve months agottThere has been a similar reduction in Russian commitments toother countries.
(9) If the Soviet Government still agreed, to a bulk contracts, we cannot tell what its terms might be.    Without the &quot;fall&quot; clause it might be for a somewhat reduced quantity, but based on a lower initial price0    That    will certainly be the object of our importers, in whose interest and on whose insistence the &quot;fall&quot;  clause was inserted.,    The Russian . interest, of course, is to get as high a price as possible(10) There is reason to doubt,  therefore, whether our action would in fact be of much benefit to Canada,,    There is also some reason to doubt whether, in any case, she can keep up her very much increased exports to this market.    A reduced export from Russia benefits primarily the other European timber producing countries, Russia&apos;s real competitors, and this is an important reason why the Soviet Government resent our singling them out as the only country to be restricted.(ll) Nevertheless,  so long as Canada presses   us under the Ottawa Agreement, we cannot very well avoid action,    In view of the very large increase in trade which the Canadian timber exporters gained last year, I do not think we need to. trouble unduly about the extra 50,000 standards from Russia (only 2^% of last year&apos;s total imports),0   .The &quot;fall&quot;  clause is a different matter, suggesting as it does a possible attack on prices.    I propose, therefore,  to inform our timber people that we object to this clause and that we wish them to make a new contract without itoWe have, of course, no control over the timber importers, and they may refuse our request.    I should be sorry to have to take the question up formally with the Soviet Government as our relations with them have much improved.    Moreover, under our &quot;balancing&quot; Agreement of last year the more trade we do with them the more must they do with us,Board of Trade,1st March, 1935.WoR.-4-
