INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India, dated 14th March, 1935.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
282Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated the 14th March, 1935, issued on the authority of the Secretary of Statefor India-1.      In the provinces there are few signs of political activity.    Though more than four months have elapsed since the Bombay Congress there are even now no definite indications of the programme to he adopted &quot;by the Village Industries Associations.    Pajendra Prasad, the President of Congress, has &quot;been engaged during the last month on an infructuous attempt to settle the communal question by conversations with the Muslim leader Mr. Jinnah.    It is understood that these conversations proceeded on the &quot;basis of surrender by Muslims of separate electorates in exchange for increased representation in the Legislatures and Services.    They were viewed with suspicion both in Hindu and Muslim circles, in particular in Bengal and the Punjab, and the misgivings of Hindus in the latter Province were shared by Sikhs.    Their failure was thus not unexpected, for there is no doubt that the majority of Hindus sympathise with the views of Malaviya and Aney in their campaign of denunciation of the award, and with the recent Anti-Communal Award Conference held in Delhi, while the opposition of the Muslims on the question of joint electorates has been stiffened by the attitude of the Hindus and Sikhs.2.     These discussions have not been without their effect on decisions in the Legislative Assembly.    To make the position clear it is desirable to indicate the strength of the various parties.    Their strength is roughly as follows.    Congress Party, 44; Congress Nationalist Party,11; Independent Party, 22; of whom 18 are Muslims; Europeangroup/
ci p m 2.group, 11.    There are also 26 official members and 13 non-official nominated members.    The Government can rely on the support of the European group and sometimes on 2 or 3 elected members, who have not joined any&apos;party. Thus, as against combined votes of Congress Party and Congress Nationalist Party totalling 55, Government can rely only on about 50 votes.    Prom this it will be seen that the result of a division depends entirely on the attitude adopted by the independents.    On the occasions referred to in the last appreciation on which the Government were defeated, the majority either voted with Congress or at any rate did not support the Government.    More recently, in the debate on the railway budget when Congress moved a motion to refuse supply to the Railway Board, the Government were defeated by 75 votes to 47*    When the Budget itself was under discussion, the Congress Party concentrated on a motion to refuse supply to the Executive Council of the Governor General on the ground that they had failed to act on decisions of the Assembly in respect of various Resolutions and Motions carried against them.On this occasion the Government were successful and secured 67 votes as against 65, many members of the Independent party voting with them.    The reason given by certain Muslim, members of this party for their action is significant.    In a published statement they point out that &quot;the Congress party and Congress Nationalist party have, to all intents and purposes, been working hand-in-hand on the communal question.    While one carries on the most virulent propaganda in and out of the Assembly, theother/
3.other sits on the fence of so-called neutrality.    They have allowed the Anti-Communal Award Conference to he held in Delhi and they allowed the Deputy President of the Assembly (a Nationalist) to make the communal award a ground for refusal of supply.    The two. groups are therefore, in our opinion, at one to undermine the position of the Muslims under the Award&quot;.    On the next day, when a token cut was moved in protest against the &quot;repressive policy&quot; of the Government, it was carried &quot;by a small majority, many of the Independents remaining neutral. The Assembly proceedings thus exemplify the difficulties of the present constitution, which, with its irremovable bureaucratic Executive at the centre and its ample reserve jjov/er, invites manifestations of irresponsibility3 since members know that as the Government can and does ignore the wilder resolutions, no practical ill effects in the country will ensue.    Congress no doubt hopes to make capital out of the refusal of the Government to act according to the decision, and will no doubt make much of the unreasonableness of the Executive.    It may be recalled that, in 1924, the Swaraj party, led by Pandit Moti Lai Nehru, made similar successful attacks on the Budget and even refused leave to introduce the Finance Bill.    What action the Congress party will take this year in regard to the Finance Bill is at present uncertain.3.     in contrast to the decision of the Assembly, it may be noted that the Council of State, which consists of 12 official members, 14 nominated non-officials and 33 elected members, supported by 32 votes to 14 a motion recognising the constitution scheme to be a great advance which askedfor/
for a fair trial.4.      The budget proposals in themselves have, on the whole, been not unfavourably received.    The proposal to allot a crore of rupees out of the balance to the provinces for economic development of rural areas is regarded as a step in the right direction, but is viewed with suspicion by Congress as an attempt to counter Mr. Gandhi&apos;s village industries movement.    The decision not to reimpose the cuts in nay has been criticised more severely in the provinces than at the Centre, especially in those provinces which have an unbalanced budget or have had to resort to additional taxation.    The failure to remove more than one third of the surcharge on income tax and, in particular, the failure to exempt the lowest incomes under rupees 2000 from the tax imposed on them in 1931 has been generally criticised. 5.      In regard to the resolutions on the constitutional proposals passed by the Conference of the Princes at Bombay, it is not possible to a dd to the statements made in the House of Commons.    The extremist organs of the Nationalist Press welcomed these decisions as tending to overthrow the proposed constitution, hut it is to be noted that they were viewed with some suspicion by at least one Nationalist paper, the &quot;Bombay Chronicle&quot; which observed: &quot;the Princes are deliberately playing hide and seek with the people of India and are still refusing to state exactly what they want.    If their present move is intended merely to secure more safeguards with a view to perpetuating their autocratic rule, they will be betraying the country&apos;s interests&quot;.
