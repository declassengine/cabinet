SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN  IMPORT No. XLII.Arab Officers&apos; Report.PARTICULAR attention is drawn to the first item (see pages 1, 2, 3, and 4).These officers, who are capable and enthusiastic, give views from that dispassionate and observant standpoint which is peculiar to the Arab, who always eliminates his personal feelings in describing a thing seen. The paragraph relating to Mackensen is of special interest, as this commmder has had under him the most heterogeneous force that has yet appeared in the field. Tire rest of the report is well worth reading, as it gives light on matters hitherto very little heard of. There would appear to be opportunities for propaganda in s nne of the evidence.Russia.The Department of Information (Foreign Office) replies this week to the note furnished by the l/oreign Office and published in Eastern Report No. XL.It is impossible to make any observation on the Russian situation, which is now so bad that it is difficult for it not to improve.Egypt.Attention is drawn to Sir R. Wingate&apos;s description of the political effect of General Allenby&apos;s success near Gaza, it is to be observed that this was written at the beginning of the operation, which has since developed materially.Hejaz.The report by Colonel Wilson on the second pilgrimage is remarkable reading. The large number of Arabian pilgrims, and the cleanliness, good health, and order which obtained, is a striking example of what follows on the disappearance of Turkish civil administration. A more daugerous place than Mecca at pilgrimage time could hardly be imagined ; fanaticism, lust of plunder, and political excitement are all easily aroused, but on this occasion, because there were no Turks to spread dissension, egg ou brigands, worry the pilgrims with bogus quarantines, and generally develop the possibilities of blackmail and intrigue, there was neither fighting, sickness, nor looting. If this is the result of the departure of the Turks from Mecca, it is impossible to estimate what may not be done in more favourable parts of the Empire.M. S.November Hi, 1917.1898-69&quot;&apos;

The names and place of origin of the officers are not given, as if these leaked out there would be a danger of their families being subject to reprisals by the Turks. It suffices to say that they come from four&apos; different towns in Syria, are of good family, and have done well in the schools : No. 1 is the son of a merchant, and has passed ten years in the various schools and obtained his diplomas as a civil engineer ; he received the Ottoman medal for special war service.No. 2. The same applies.No. 3 is the son of a professor, and has passed the law school at Beyrut, and was before the war intending to obtain a post in the ministry of public instruction ; he received the Iron Cross of the 2nd class.No. 4 was a theological student, and obtained good degrees both in Cairo and Stambul; he received the Ottoman medal for special war service.All four were drafted into the officers&apos; school in 1913, and given commissions on the outbreak of war in the same regiment. Since May 1915 Nos. 1 and 3 have been in the same battalion; Nos. 2 and 4 in different&apos; battalions.Before May 1915 they were employed in the Suez Canal expedition in various capacities on the lines of communications; after that date they were allocated as stated. Their movements from the time they joined their regiments were as follows : Proceeded to Dardanelles in August 1915 ; quartered most of the time in the vicinity of Bulair, moving to Enos in July 1916, and thence to Adrianople August 1916 ; proceeded toDobrudja in early September 1916 ; present at battles of Kopadin-Enghes-Chattal, and Huyuk ; in October moved to Charnauda and thence to Mejedie[89S-69] B
in same month ; in November transferred to Derapanto&apos;; in December in Mackensen&apos;s offensive; then they went to&quot;Baba Dagh, and in a big battle lost half the effectives of their regiment but drove the Russians back to Ishaka; in January 1917 they refitted at Cherna and transferred to vicinity of Braila ; and in August, on hearing of the independence of the King of Hejaz, they contrived to pass over to the Russians. They spent three months getting from Braila to London.The narratives of these officers are given with great candour, and I have formed a good opinion of them. They are desirous of proceeding at once to Egypt to join the Arab Legion.   They are practically all&apos;of an age, the eldest, being 25, the youngest 24.The following are their observations on various matters of interest: Mackensen.The officers had the highest opinion of Mackensen, who appeared to them to have the qualities of an ideal leader.This general was&apos;well liked by all troops of the various nations under him; he seemed to show no favouritism in regard to Bulgars, Germans, or Turks, and by various means managed to give every regimental officer the impression that no matter how junior he was his views were considered by the commander-in-chief in relation to matters in which he (the junior regimental officer) was primax&apos;ily concerned. When a big move was in course of preparation, all battalion and company commanders received envelopes con-taining a series of questions which the officer had to answer himself, enclose in the envelope, and send to headquarters. The questions were such as these (the officers gave them from memory) : Describe the sector on the map in which you usually operate.What is the enemy on your immediate front ?What is his morale ?What is he in defence ?What is he in offence ?In what does he excel Bomb-throwing ? Raiding ? Sniping ? Mining, &amp;c. ?Are you well supported by our artillery ?What do you think of the enemy&apos;s artillery ?If we attack, how should the local attack be carried out ?If we attack, what immediate local advantage shall we gain ?Is an attack advisable from a local point of view ?These questions were printed in German and Turkish, and gave every officer immense satisfaction, owing to the fact that they felt they had an opportunity of stating their case directly to the commander-in-chief, and that he took this into-consideration when concerting his plans.Mackensen was exceedingly strict and precise in regard to movements when an attack was launched, and punished very severely any commander, high or low, who advanced too far and for sake of glory exposed his men.The impression that Mackensen gave was that he never threw men away unneces-sarilv, and never struck unless he was sure of what he was about; consequently troops would cheerfully bear casualties under his leadership which they would not otherwise have done.Mackensen was a strict disciplinarian, but not barbarous or unjust in his punish-ment. He always insisted that no company should fail in an attack to capture a prisoner. For capture of prisoners the officers obtained decorations, and men a grant of 10 fr. or promotion.Roumanian Army.The Ptoumanian army was quite hopeless at the outset; with the exception of the artillery, which was wellserved butseemed short of shells. The infantry was badly led, badly ..disposed, and quite destitute of morale.   The change that has come about is incredible. The Roumanian troops would now appear to be the best in the field on either side in that theatre of operations courageous, well led, and tenacious.
ROTTMANIA (DOBRUDJA).. The atoocities perpetrated on the Roumanian population in the Dobrudja during the advance are terrible bearing. The Turks robbed and burnt. The Germans robbed and raped. The Bulgarians robbed, burnt, raped, and, further, killed all people who came in their way. In the track of the Bulgarian troops heaps of dead were always to be found in the houses. This was openly stated to be the Bulgarians&apos; revenge on the Roumanians for their treacherous attack during the second Balkan war.Roumania Proper.In Roumania the Germans took control and observed the following policy : The whole population, so far as witnesses could see, was registered, and every male and female given a brassard with a number. The men were immediately organised into gangs of agricultural labourers, road-builders, and set to works of military construction. The women were also sent in gangs with brassards and numbers, and worked under supervision of German, Austrian, and Bulgarian non-commissioned officers. Troops living in the vicinity used these women just as they liked and when they liked. As one officer said, there is not a virgin of 11 years of age left in Roumania. Bourgeois women, if they were good-looking, were offered the choice of being labelled and sent to work in the fields and constantly raped, or of being appointed domestic servants to, the staff officers. In the event of their accepting the latter choice they were allowed to work without a brassard.In regard to plunder, troops of all nations were encouraged to destroy and smash private residences as much as possible, except in Bucharest. The Bulgars had a well-organised plunder transport, wdiich took heavy useful objects back to Bulgaria. The Germans concentrated on lighter valuables and objects of art, clocks, pictures, tapestries, &amp;c, &amp;c, which were carefully packed up and sent away. In the case of a well-padded tapestry-lined armchair, the Bulgars took the chair after the Germans had stripped off the tapestry. The Turks, annoyed at being too far from home to profit by the occasion, usually burnt things, as they were, jealous of their falling into the hands of the others.All metals, brass handles, door-knockers, bell-pulls, &amp;c, were collected and sent to Germany, both in Bucharest and elsewhere. Factory machinery, iron girders, every-thing that could be used, was also stripped from buildings and sent to Germany. Rafters, doors, window-frames, served as fuel for the troops. Museums, picture galleries, &amp;c, were all emptied of their contents and the same sent to Germany.Bulgarian Army.The common soldiers were brutal and savage like Turks, but more intelligent. The officers efficient, but ill-mannered. The high command exceedingly cautious, and determined not to lose a single man they could help.The Bulgarians had no grievance against the Russians, and often said when they had revenged themselves on the Roumanians they would join with the Russians in clearing the Germans and Turks out of the Balkans.In November 191 .6 there was a considerable movement among the Bulgarians to fraternise with the Russians.The Bulo-arian relations with the Turks were very bad. The Bulgarian Moslems were never allowed to approach the Turks, and the Bulgarian populace jeered at the Turks when they passed through Bulgarian territory, shouting out, &quot; Wait till this war is over, and we will clear you out of Eur. me !&quot;A Bulgarian general told a Turkish regimental commander that the Bulgarian people had revenged themselves on the Serbs and Roumanians and were satisfied.Turks.Owing to Mackensens good management the Turks in Roumania were very appreciative of bis efforts. But although better fed and treated than any other Turkish troops, there was a strong feeling that their own country was losing while they were fighting for others.The Turks&apos; relations with the Bulgars were what might be expected. On one occasion a Turkish regimental commander said : &quot; We shall attack to-moi-row ; the Bulgarian uniforms are luckily very like the Russian uniforms, and whichever you shoot you are doing a good turn.&quot;
The Turkish army is very much disheartened and discontented; a very small spark would set the whole army in a blaze, but it would certainly require a highly placed man to start the trouble. Rumours of Envers death were frequent, and always received with delight. Had the Russian revolution not occurred, the fall of Baghdad would probably have brought about a crisis.Russian Army.The Russian army is disgraceful and shameful ; during the officers&apos; passage through Russia, they saw train-loads of wounded&apos; women, from the womensbattalions, hooted and mobbed by deserters and shirkers who skulk in the rear. The position of officers is unspeakable ; the men spit on them and menace them many officers commit suicide. The Russian common soldiers now despise bravery, which they consider a bad quality -that is whv they hoot the women who fight. The only disciplined forces are the Cossacks and the artillery.Moslem, Christian, and Jewish officers are all united. In Tartar Moslem units the men are more disciplined, because a Moslem Tartar officer can appeal to his men in a way a Russian officer cannot appeal to Russians. The worst disciplined troops, however, are the Caucasus Moslem Circassians, who are against the war, the Russians, and their own officers. However, the officers say that if the Roumanian army could change from a, rabble to a first-class force, and the Turkish army of the Balkan war become what the Turkish army was at the beginning of this war, there is no reason why the Russian army should not revive again.Pan-Turanianism.There is a great deal of Turkish propaganda among the Tartars and Circassians, with the object of raising the whole of the Russian Moslems. It does not seem to have taken a violent hold, but sooner or later will do so, the officers believe, unless met by strong counter-propaganda. They themselves tried this line, and found that it was very easy to counter Turkish propaganda for the moment, but that there was no effort made to stop it. The Russian Moslems are nearly as stupid as the Russians ; they cheered equally loudly pro-Turkish speeches and anti-Turkish speeches made in succession.RUSSIA. .A Resident Englishman s view of the Situation. A note, furnished by the Foreign Office, was printed under this heading in Eastern Report No. XL, on which the following comments have been made by the Department of Information : The views expiration-essed by &quot; A Resident Englishman&quot; make the following accusations : 1. A separate peace on the part of Russia is merely a matter of time.2. The whole of the directing element of the Sovyet consists of Jews and for themost part German Jews. 3. Kerensky&apos;s private secretary is a Jew, undoubtedly in the pay of the Bolshevikorganisation.4. Kerensky himself was formerly in the pay of the International, and he continuesto be in sympathy with the Kienthal group, &amp;c. 5. Terestchenko and other moderate elements are put in the Government to deceivethe Allies.He then advises the Allies to organise a counter-revolution. His accusations may be answered as follows : 1. Every party in Bussia has openly repudiated the idea of a separate peace, and every reliable witness that comes from Russia states that the idea of a separate peace is utterly repugnant to the Russian nation.2. The Jews on the central executive committee of the Sovyet are partly Moderates and partly Extremists. It is absolutely unfair to classify all the Jews as Extremists. It is also untrue to describe Russian Jews, most of whom have German names, as German Jews.3. Kerensky&apos;s private secretary is a Jew named Soskis, who is well known in England, where he lived until a few months ago. If he were or ever had been in the pay of the Bolshevik organisation it is inconceivable that such sleuthhounds as Burtsev and Alexinsky would not have revealed it to the Bussian public long ago.
4. Formerly Kerensky belonged to the &quot; Socialist International &quot; ; so did Vander-velde, Hyndman, Thomas, and Scheidemann. But certainly Kerensky now stands not for international Socialism but.for Russia. There is absolutely no foundation for saying that he is in sympathy with the Kienthal group, and he has severed all connection with Chernov, who was the only pacifist member in any Government that Kerensky belonged to. If Kerensky really intended to throw in his lot with the Bolsheviks it is quite certain that he would have been publicly denounced in Russia long since, and that the Cadets would never have joined any Government of which he was Prime Minister.5. It is impossible to believe that Tereshchenko and other moderate elements in the present Government could be so naive as to let their names be used merely to deceive the allies. It may be taken for granted that they know just as much about Kerensky and his intentions as the &quot; Resident Englishman.&quot;The &quot;Resident Englishman&apos;s&quot; advice to the allies to organise a counter-revolution is as absurd and impracticable as it would be dangerous if it were listened to.Current Events. Sir E. Howard telegraphed from Stockholm on the 12th November [No. 3179] that the following had been received from the vice-consul at Haparanda : -According to the report of the Italian Ambassador at Petrograd, passing through Haparanda, all political parties without exception had deserted the Bolschevik, who were then supported by sailors only.Kerensky. had issued a manifesto stating that he was marching on Petrograd and asking for the support of all soldiers who were loyal to the Provisional Government.The Ambassador had stated that the Bolschevik revolution would be over in a few days. The Committee of Safety, which had been organised by the mayor of Petrograd, was supporting Kerensky and protecting the allied embassies, who had refused to recognise the Bolscheviks. All news from Petrograd should be treated with caution, as the telegraph was controlled by Bolscheviks.Sir E. Howard added that Helsingfors was in the hands of the Bolscheviks, but otherwise quiet.   No Germans were to be seen there,Telegraphing again [No. 3182] on the same day, Sir E. Howard said that the afternoon telegrams from Haparanda had announced the arrival of Kerensky and troops at Petrograd; the Finnish newspapers were heralding the downfall of the Bolscheviks. Telegrams from Moscow and southern Russia reported that the country was controlled by Cossacks working under Kerensky. The Bolschevik troops had been severely beaten at Tsarkoe Selo and had retired to Petrograd.Telegraphing again on the 13th November [No. 3186], he said that the Finnish telegram Bureau had stated that Kerensky was at Petrograd and had taken practically the whole town and that the telegraph was in his control. Moscow was the headquarters, of the Provisional Government. Kerensky had issued orders from Moscow which had appeared in the Petrograd newspapers. Anti-Bolschevik papers in Petrograd, also the Heisingfors pajjers, had headlines announcing that the Bolschevik movement was nearing its downfall. The whole of Russia except a small part of Petrograd was in the hands of the Provisional Government. Kaledin was dictator in southern Russia. The orders of the Provisional Government were signed Kerensky, Korniloff, Kaledin. Passengers who had arrived from Petrograd on that day [the 13th November] stated that when they left Petrograd there was fighting in the streets between the populace and the Bolscheviks. The Bolscheviks had been defeated by Kerensky at the Summer palace outside Petrograd and the Petrograd garrison was deserting the Bolscheviks. The embassies of the allies were in connection with Kerensky. The Cossacks had destroyed the Red Guard, the chief Bolschevik regiment; and the populace were tearing down Bolschevik declarations in Petrograd and hooting the Bolschevik leaders in the streets.Situation in Odessa. Telegraphic communication with Petrograd being interrupted, the consul at Odessa telegraphed a message to Teheran for transmission to England. Sir C. Marling despatched this message on the 12th November [No. 379]. It was to the effect that General Marx had informed the consul on [?j the 10th November that the Provisional Government having been overthrown a new one was being formed, and the situation would clear in a few days. General Marx, the chief of the military district, had allied himself with the revolutionary committee, and declared for the Maximalists, who were, in power in Odessa, though opposed by the Roumanian-front army committee [898-69] C
and by the municipality. The consul said that so far life was normal, order having been maintained, except that after dark street robberies were very numerous.The Ukraine. In the same telegram the consul at Odessa said that the central Rada at Kieff has declared itself for the temporary government of an autonomous Ukraine in which Odessa would be included. The-authority for this statement was a telegram received through the railway authorities.POLAND.The Central Party.-Sir E. Howard telegraphed from Stockholm on the 12tb November [No. 3180] reporting a conversation of some three hours&apos; duration which be had had with the recently-elected head of the Central party in Poland, Prince Alexander Lubecki, who had just arrived from Warsaw and Berlin. The latter had said that until the Russian revolution the allies had always declared that the Polish question was not international, but a Russian internal one, whilst Germany had offered them independence and even self-government ; and since the allies made no definite statement as to their aims in regard to Poland, the Polish parties could only look facts in the face and take what they could from Germany. In fact his party believed that the allies would never be in a position to impose on Germany such terms as the restitution of the German-Polish provinces or indemnity for goods seized ; for it, the Polish Central party, belieyed that the war would end in a stalemate. The Poles therefore felt that to accept what they could get from the central Powers was the only practical course open to them, in spite of the fact that they were to all intents unanimous in their feeling against Germany as an indication of that feeling he mentioned that the principal Polish club in Warsaw would not permit a German officer to pass its doors. The German Government had already requisitioned all kinds of goods, and had cut down forests ; it had also made a careful inventory of the national resources and had threatened, unless the present Polish Government would work on the lines of solution proposed by the German Government, that it would requisition goods to an extent which would leave the country absolutely bare when peace was declared.Sir Esme Howard replied that the allies proposed for Poland the union, of all truly Polish districts (though not necessarily the incorporation of provinces which were not ethnologically Polish, if the inhabitants objected), independence, and access to the sea. In regard to the last point, the prince said that the internationalisation of the Vistula had been agreed to by Germany. He also said that Polish public opinion, after many fluctuations, seemed to be Inclined to a personal union with Austria, if Galicia were united with Poland. Sir E. Howard expressed the opinion that the best thing for the Polish parties to do was to avoid committing themselves in any way to the central Powers and to await the end of the war.In regard to the creation of an army, Sir E. Howard said that this would undoubtedly commit the Polish parties to those Powers, for it was absurd to suppose that such an army would not be completely under German control, to be used against the allies if necessity required; this would hopelessly compromise the position of the Poles at the peace congress. The prince replied that the Polish Government only intended to raise an army of 100,000 men primarily for maintenance of order at home, as a nucleus of a future army and to defend the frontiers against Germans or Russians. They would, he said, get back a half-million or more deported Polish workmen who were now releasing German labour for the army ; in comparison with this number of released workmen, that of the German soldiers who would be relieved from duty in Poland was insignificant. Sir E. Howard observed that it was out of the question to talk of such an army defending Poland against Germany, and there was a strong probability of it being used against the allies; this would be considered as an alliance with the central Powers and might be fatal for the future of Poland.Prince Alexander criticised (with considerable severity) M. Dmowski (who, he said,was a republican), and....., saying that they refused to recognise the position ofaffairs in Poland itself.The Polish Question in Germany and Austria. Sir W. Townley. telegraphed from The Hague on the 11th November [No. 3739] that it had been announced that the Polish question, which had suddenly assumed such prominence, would be the chief subject discussed at the main committee meeting of the Reichstag, fixed for the 18th or 19th of this month, and also by the Austro-Hungarian Delegation, summoned to meet on the 3rd December in Vienna.j
TURKEY.Miscellaneous. An agent reports that an informant who is in close touch with Talaat and Prince Said Halim has told him : (1) That the Turks are making every effort to persuade the Bulgars to give back the territory ceded by Turkey earlier in the war ; (2) that the Ex-Khedive had already bad some friction in Constantinople with the Government circles ; and (3) that the Turkish authorities are most anxious to obtain the release from Malta of Sabri Bey.EGYPT.Political Effect of General Allenhifs Victory. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 8th November [No. 1184] that the political effect of General Allenby&apos;s victory bad been excellent. The Sultan had sent cordial congratulations, and native opinion, which had been agitated by the recent Italian news, was much reassured, the Turcophils being correspondingly depressed. The public was evidently impressed by the complete success of the commander-in-chiefs admirably conceived and brilliantly executed plans, and it certainly appreciated the frank tone of his communiques, which had been published without delay.   Victory could scarcely have come at a more opportune moment.CYRENAICA.Assistance for Idrisi. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 8th November [No. 1186], in reply to Mr. Balfour&apos;s telegram of the 6th [Eastern Report XBT, p. 4 saying that a delay in the grant of assistance to Idrisi would be dangerous, whilst a show of confidence would go far to gain his active co-operation. He agreed that the quantity of war material that Idrisi required and could make use of should be decided by the Italians, who had fuller information, but they would find that generosity in regard to money and material would pay best. He was confident that they would be well advised to take the risks resulting from the gift of such material as Idrisi required for the firm establishment of his own position and the withstanding of hostile factions ; and this in spite of the effect of the recent Italian news on the Senoussi situation which Sir R. Wingate describes as incalculable.HEJAZ.King Hussein and the Gaza Victory. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 9th November that King Hussein had sent cordial congratulations on the Gaza victory, which he considered &quot; an important step towards the liberation of Arab countries from Turanian oppressors.&quot; Sir R. Wingate added that he had sent the King a suitable acknowledgment on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Pilgrimage of 1917. Colonel Wilson has sent the following report on the pilgrimage of 1917 : It may, I think, be said that for a war-time pilgrimage that of 1917 may be reckoned a great success from every point of view.The number of sea-borne pilgrims was considerably less than last year, but those ,,- from various parts of Arabia were nearly twice the number.The multitude which assembled at Arafat is estimated at 58,000, of which the principal parties from outside the Hejaz were -From Nejd, about 12,500.From Yemen, about 6,000.From Sudan (Takruris), about 6,000.From various eastern tribes, about 5,500.Apart from jrablic security and health, which will be touched on later, the most outstanding feature of this years pilgrimage was, perhaps, the presence of Emir Mohammed Ibn Saud (brother of the Emir of Nejd), who came attended by 7,000 armed Arabs.His father, the Imam Abel Er Rahman, started for Mecca, but got a touch of the sun four days on the road, and had to return.The Emir Mohammed was well and hospitably received by King Hussein, and he and his people were very well pleased with the manner in which they were treated [898-69] D
It says, I think, a great deal for King Hussein that no unpleasant incident is reported, when it is remembered that Wahabites are regarded as heretics, to a very great extent, by the orthodox Moslem, and particularly so by Meccans and Hejazi Arabs.A curious side-light is thrown on the attitude of Ibn Saud&apos;s family towards King Hussein by the following : Emir Mohammed wrote, when at Mecca, asking the King to lend him 2,000Z., and to give him seven male and eight or nine female slaves.The mother of the Imam Abd Er Rahman and one of the wives of Ibn Saud also wrote to the King asking him for a present of clothes, &amp;c, for themselves.All the presents were given.Public Security. No report of any untoward incident has been received. Information received from many sources all proves that the road to Mecca and on to Arafat was perfectly safe, and King Hussein appears to have done everything possible to make the journey of the pilgrims as comfortable and easy as possible.At the time of writing (11th October) no complaint of any sort has been received from the pilgrims.Public Health was very good ; there was no case of plague or cholera, and I understand that the causes of the few deaths which occurred were practically all either old age or a type of diarrhoea.I think there is little doubt that this clean bill of health was largely due to the improved quarantine arrangements made at Mecca and Muna.General.- -The number of pilgrims arriving by sea at Jeddah was small (some 2,030, excluding Takruris from Sudan), but the arrangements for quarantine, landing, housing, &amp;c, worked smoothly, and the charges made were, as far as has been ascertained, in accordance with the King&apos;s schedule of fees.Names of various important chiefs who attended the pilgrimage will be given in a full report to be forwarded later.It is satisfactory to know from Hussein Ruhi that on practically every occasion on which King Hussein addressed assemblies of chiefs and Arabs during the pilgrimage he emphasised the fact that Great Britain was the firm and true friend of the Arabs, and that without her assistance the revolt would have been impossible.PERSIA.Kavam-us-Sultaneh. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 10th November [No. 377] that it was thought that the fall of the Cabinet would not be long delayed in spite of the fact that Kavam-us-Sultaneh had joined it, as Minister of the Interior, under pressure fromthe Shah.A German Party. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 9th November [No. 374 a] with reference to his telegram of the 3rd November, in which he said that notice had been received from Meshed to the effect that on the 26th October a party of Germans had left Herat in a south-westerly direction [Eastern Report XLI, p. 5, &quot; Afghanistan &quot;]. He said that Persian and Russian information confirmed the news contained in a telegram from the agent at Turbat-i-Haidari, that a conflict had taken place between this party, with its Persian followers, and the Persian Government troops. All escaped except three Persians, who were killed, and one European, who was captured.The Gendarmerie Brigands. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 12th November [No. 380] that on the 4th the Russians had captured 1,200 Persian gendarmes, with their officers, and were taking them to Kermanshah. The gendarmes were accompanied by Erick and Niedermayer, who left them at [?] Kirkuk for Mosul.
LATEST INFORMATION.RUSSIA.The Situation. Sir E. Howard telegraphed from Stockholm on the 15th November [No. 3197] that all telegraphic communication with Petrograd had been broken off on the previous day. The following had been received from the vice-consul at Haparanda :  Guerilla warfare in Petrograd renewed. City still controlled by Bolcheviks. Telegraph and telephone reported wrecked. Neither Kerensky nor any of his representatives was in Petrograd on Tuesday morning. The allied embassies had refused all connection with the Bolcheviks.. The Bolcheviks soldiers were entirely without officers. Various reports stated that Kerensky was advancing on Petrograd with an army of Cossacks. There was no definite news as to what was happening outside Petrograd. One report made the strength of Kerensky&apos;s army 100,000, whilst the Bolcheviks said that he had only 5,000. The food question in Petrograd was becoming serious through shortage of bread.A telegram from Sir G. Buchanan, despatched from Haparanda on the loth November, stated that the situation was unchanged and that the telegraph service in Petrograd was so uncertain that he was sending his message via Helsingfors. All well at the embassy?- on the 13th November.Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 15th November [No. 388a] transmitting a message from the consul at Odessa, in turn transmitting one from the vice-consul at Eaeff, despatched on the 13th November, to the effect that civil war had broken out, and that there was heavy rifle, machine-gun, and artillery fire, especially at night. There were many victims. Barricades had been erected in many streets. The consulate was guarded by six cadets. The Ukraine regiment was opposed to the Government.Finland. Sir E. Howard on the 15th November transmitted [No. 3206] the following from vice-consul at Haparanda : According to the latest reports a general strike has been declared in Finland. The train from Petrograd is arriving to-day, but the train to Petrogracl is not expected to leave Tornea,   No news from Russia to-day.TURKEY.Germany and Turkey. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed [No. 1053] on the 7th November (message received on the 12th) that the following information which had reached him from a reliable source represented statements made by Fahreddin Bey, late Turkish ambassador at Petrograd, and Halil Bey, Turkish military attache at Berne. During the recent visits to Berlin of Talaat, Enver, and Djemal, the German Government made every effort to show that Germany had been victorious on all sides, but the Turkish leaders appeared not to have been impressed, and to have maintained that Great Britain alone could claim substantial success up to the present. They further demanded with considerable insistence that Germany should afford Turkey more effective military aid than hitherto. As a result of this representation and of the concern with which German authorities had viewed the recent attitude of Turkey and the behaviour of many Turkish military officers towards the Germans in Turkey, it was decided, as a first step, that the Emperor should proceed to Constantinople, where he appeared to have promised that Germany would afford Turkey effective aid in driving the British troops out of Mesopotamia and Syria. As soon as the Italian offensive was brought to an end a serious blow would, according to the informant, be struck either in Macedonia or in Mesopotamia and Palestine perhaps on both these fronts; apart from Turkish representations, the German Government was persuaded that such action was essential in order to maintain German prestige in the East.The Turks mentioned in the first paragraph appeared to be convinced that the offensive should be on such a scale as to ensure success. Similar views had been expressed by the son of the late vali of Hedjaz. now at Lausanne, on receipt of a letter from his father in Constantinople ; also by Djevdat Bey, who had just arrived in Vienna from Constantinople.
Reports in regard to dissatisfaction in Turkish circles on account of inadequate military assistance rendered to Turkey by her allies had reached the legation from a number of Oriental sources, and there could be no doubt that the situation had recently1 been very strongly brought to the notice of Germany by the Turkish leaders, and that their insistence had amounted almost to an ultimatum. Turkish dissatisfaction had doubtless been aggravated by the realisation of their dwindling man-power, and of the impossibility of keeping up effectives owing to the exhaustion of their resources.IPRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFTICB BY c.
