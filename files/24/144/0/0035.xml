SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT; No.  LXRussia.M. TROTSKY&apos;S speech given in the Latest Intelligence is to be noted; it is the first declaration on the vital matter of discipline in the army which has emanated from any one in nominal or actual authority since General. KornilofFs abortive effort during the Kerensky regime. It may well be that this speech of M. Trotsky&apos;s is pure vapouring, but it is interesting nevertheless, as one would imagine that such utterances would not be tolerated by any progressive Russian audience, since i1 virtually repudiates the whole theory of life on which Bolshevism is based.Turkey.Sir H Rumbold&apos;s account of the Turkish politician^ views is interesting. It points to the one real Turkish weakness, and that is the Turks&apos; fear of Bulgaria. The Turks evidently feel that, if Bulgaria, were, but out of the way, their road to India and Central Asia would be open, and that England could be easily dealt with at a later date.Abyssinia. The Abyssinian situation is again critical.Armenia.The Turks are now commencing operations of extermination. It is possible that the enthusiasm of the Turks in their fresh advance may make them feel that it is unnecessary to conceal massacres under the form of punitive expeditions or concen-tration camps.M.

Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the 15th March [No. 22] that he and M. Trotsky were leaving for Moscow that night.The Moscow Congress. Mr. Wardrop telegraphed on the 16th March [No. 84] that the peace treaty had been ratified. The left wing of the Social Revolutionaries had left the Bolsheviks, refusing to share with them the responsibility for this.Ukraine.Capture of Odessa by the Germans. The consul at Mariupol telegraphed on the 16th March that the authorities at Sevastopol had informed him of the capture of Odessa by the Germans.Roumanian Prisoners at Odessa. - Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 17th March [No. 242] that the Roumanian prisoners in Odessa had been sent to Sebastopol. Colonel Boyle bad succeeded in persuading the Bolsheviks to repatriate them, and arrangements were being made for this ; but apparently a Committee of Roumanian deserters had intervened and procured the change, probably that the prisoners might be used as hostages with a view to obtaining an amnesty for themselves.Lithuania.Request that the German Government should retognise its Independence. Sir EsmO Howard telegraphed on the 12th March [No. 693] that one of the Lithuanian representa-tives in &quot;Stockholm, Dr. Szlutas (a naturalized American who was sent over some time[898-87] BPrinted for the War Cabinet.
ago by the Lithuanian representatives to assist the Lithuanians in Russia) had asked him to submit the following to His Majesty&apos;s Government : As stated in the German papers, the Landcsrat on the 16th February resolved to send an address to the Governments of Russia, Germany, and other States. This address declared in favour of an independent (? Lithuania), with its capital at Vilna, built upon democratic foundations, and separate from all political connections which had existed with other nations. [This was of course aimed at Poland.] The Lithuanian National Council further declared that the form of the. new State and its foreign relations should be settled by a constituent assembly, to be convoked as soon as possible. The National Council concluded by asking the German Government to recognise LithuaniaH independence.Sir Esme Howard went on to say that Dr. Szlutas begged that the independence of Lithuania should also be recognized by us, at all events until the peace congress, when there would be a final settlement.Courland.The Landesral and Germany. Sir W. Townley telegraphed on the 14th March [No. 1086] that&apos;the &quot; Vorwarts &quot; of the 13th March announced that the Landesrat of Courland had, on the 8th March, under the presidency of the German Governor, unanimously decided to offer the duchy to the German Emperor, and that on the occasion when this happened two representatives of Livonia and Esthonia were present.It stated that the Landesrat had given expression to the wish that the whole of the &quot; Baltenland&quot; should be incorporated in the German Empire. Some gentlemen present had stipulated that they could only support the motion on the condition that all three provinces above mentioned were included in the German. Empire. The &quot; Vorwarts&quot; said that as Eschonia and Livonia were on the Russian side of the line drawn between Germany and Russia by the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, these far-reaching ambitions could not be gratified without entailing a new war against Russia. In the interval, however, it would be wise to consider whether consent to the offer of the Baltic barons, to which as a further ornament two Lettish barons had been added, could in any way be brought into harmony with the declaration of the Chancellor on the 29th November that he would respect the principle that the right of self-determination could only be expressed by the popular voice or exercised by a freely elected body of popular representatives. The Courland Landesrat was as little representative of the population of Courland as was the three-class Prussian House of Representatives of the Prussian people.Esthonia.Question as to Recognition of Independence. In reply to a telegram [No. 691] sent by Sir Esme Howard, saying that M. Tonisson had asked whether His Majestys Govern-ment would provisionally recognise the independence of Esthonia pending a final settlement by the peace congress, Mr. Balfour telegraphed on the 14th March [No. 462] that Sir Esme might repeat the assurance already given [E.R. LVII, p. 4], and add that no settlement contrary to the principle contained therein would be recognized, but that His Majesty&apos;s Government was not prepared to go further than this.ROUMANIA.Resignation of General Averescu. Lord Bertie transmitted on the 14th and 15th March [Nos. 387 and 389]Jtwo telegrams which had been sent by the Allied Ministers at Jassy to their respective Governments. They announced the resignation of General Averescu&apos;s Ministry, and said that M. Marghiloman had been summoned by the King, who had laid down the principle that any new Government must make a point of maintaining friendly relations with the Entente. M. Marghiloman agreed; but it should be remembered that he had always doubted an Entente victory.On the 16th March Sir G. Barclay telegraphed from Jassy [No. 237] that General Averescu had told him that he did not know whether he was still Prime Minister, or, should he not be, who would succeed him. As long as he held that office his promise would be observed, and no war material would pass to the enemy; he added that, so far, the Germans had made no demand in that regard.
SERBIA.Declaration as to the Allied Policy [E. R. LEX, p. 2]. Sir C. des Graz telegraphed from Corfu on the 17th March [No. 40] that he had communicated Mr. BalfouPs permission to M. Bashitch. A favourable reply to a similar question had also been received from America and communicated to M. Pashitch. This was to the effect that the. Presidents message was not intended to be a full programme but rather a brief summary of war aims, and that M. Pashitch might say that in the event of victory the aspirations of Serbian arms would (in so far as might be possible) be met.Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 41] Sir C. des Graz reported that in consequence of a Ministerial crisis M. Pashitch had been charged by the Crown Prince with the formation of a Ministry, preferably coalition. He had hopes of success, and had called together the Opposition leaders, who had put their conditions in writing.TURKEY.Situation in Constantinople. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed from Berne on the 14th March [No. 372] that he had received an account of the situation in Constantinople in a letter from a Turkish politician.The general opinion, according to Sir H. Rumbold&apos;s correspondent is that, as Russia has been dismembered and eliminated and Turkey is about to regain some of her old territory, the present is a favourable moment for the latter Power (which came into the war principally on account of Russia) to conclude peace with France and England, who have always been looked upon as Turkey:s friends ; and it was clear that Turkey Considered that only with the support of England could the new situation be prosperous. This was the opinion expressed in private conversation by certain Turkish diplomats and emissaries, who further thought that Germany would be of no great use to them once peace had been declared.Bulgaria was a source of anxiety as, on account of the proportions which her military power was assuming, she was becoming a vital danger to Constantinople. But if Turkish interests became identical with English, then the situation could be safeguarded by England and her allies.It was believed that accomplished facts (especially the extension of Turkish influence towards Central Asia and what had been done in the Caucasus) would not be easily altered by the western allies; and it was known that Turkish officers, prisoners of war, had wrought the disorganization of the Prussian provinces, so that Enver and the military part? had gone up in public opinion.The Soviets formed by these Turkish officers worked and were still working for the union with Turkey of all the Moslem populations, by whom the principle that all. nations should dispose freely of their destiny is welcomed. The scheme of the Pan-Moslems extends to Persia, and one section of the Persian people, with which the Young Turks have already come to an understanding, will work for the entry of Persia into this confederation of Turkish States. Sir H. R,umbold&apos;s correspondent, anticipating that the place occupied formerly by Russia would be taken fry Turkey, thought that an attempt to control the nascent movement should be made by England and the party to which he himself belongs.ABYSSINIA.Revolt against Ras Seyoum. Mr. Campbell telegraphed from Adis Abeba On the 16th March [No. 30] that the province of Tigre was in revolt against Ras Seyoum, who had been held up on his way there. It was feared that other provinces \voulcl join inj and the situation caused anxiety.RUSSIA IN ASIA.Siberia.Outbreak at Blagoveshchensk. Sir j. Jordan telegraphed from Pekin on the 15th March [No. 250] that the consul at Harbin had informed him that the Bolsheviks had completely crushed the premature outbreak against the Soviet at Blagovestchensk, in Eastern Siberia ; the desertion of the Cossacks had produced a panic. Of the officers concerned, nearly all had committed suicide or been killed.[898-87] B 2
Caucasus.The General Situation. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Lord Reading on the 13th March [No. 1434] the following statement as to the situation in the Caucasus. The Moslems intended to hold the districts of Resht, Baku, and Elizabetpol so soon as the Russians had completely evacuated them. The Tartars, who wished the Turks to have the country, and were opposed to foreign intervention, were concentrating at various places, and were being organised by released prisoners of war, German and Turkish. They controlled the railway and the telegraph between Tiflis and Baku. The Bolsheviks controlled KrasnoVedsk and Petrovsk.Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 1 7th March [No. 226] that he had received the following information from the late Russian consul at Kasvin, who had left Tiflis on the 2nd March and had just reached Teheran. He said that the meeting of the Diet was fixed for the 2nd April, pending which a dictator had been appointed. A deputation had left for Trebizond to discuss terms with the Turks, with whom peace would be made : it was not likely that there would be opposition to the cession of Kars and Batoum. The Government was trying to sell the whole of the Caspian merchant vessels and warships. The Armenians,in the Caucasus were powerless. Baku, he said, was full of Germans.The Baku District. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 16th March [No. 222] that it was reported that the whole of this district had been occupied by the Turks.Sir W. Townley, telegraphing from The Hague on the same day [No. 1112], said that it was stated that the Government of the Caucasian Eepublic (founded the 12th November, 1917, and carried on by twelve members) had refused to recognize the clause in the Brest-Litovsk treaty providing for the separation of the three Caucasian provinces of Batum, Kars, and Ardahan against the will of their inhabitants [see above], and the seizure of Batum, the only port in the country, which was of vital importance to the future of the Caucasus. The Bolshevik delegates had protested against this clause and declared that they would only sign it under protest.ARMENIA.Turkish Atrocities. Sir W. Townley telegraphed on the 16th March [No. 1112] that he had received a communication from the Armenian Correspondence Bureau at The Hague informing him of terrible atrocities which, according to the Balkan Agency, the Turks had committed on their return to Trebizond. Sacks full of Armenian children had been thrown into the sea, old men and women were crucified and subjected to nameless tortures, and all women and girls, even girls ten years old, were delivered into the hands of the Turks.PERSIA.Mustaufi-ul-Mamelek. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 15th March [No. 214] that Mnstaufi-ul-Mamelek [see E.R. LIX, p. 4] was much pleased by Kucbik Khan arresting the vice-consul at Resht and the bank manager; and a letter from Obeidola to Kuchik stated that the latter would receive every assistance from Mustaufi-ul-Mamelek after his (Mustauffs) arrival in Tehran.The Captive Viee-Consul.- Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 15th March [No. 217] that the (? acting vice-consul) of Re&apos;sht had visited the headquarters of the Jangali at Kasma to endeavour to secure the release of the captives, but had returned without having accomplished bis object.Murder of (?) a Newspaper Editor.Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 15th March [No. 215] the news of the murder, in a crowded street, of [? the editor] of a newspaper which Firuz Mirza controls in our interest. The intimidation of the dissentient democrats was obviously the intention of this crime; the section, that is, which disapproved of the policy, imposed by the extremists on the present Cabinet, of hostility to us. No attempt had been made to arrest the assassin. The Opposition might attempt a coup cVetat to eject the present Cabinet; it was certainly prepared to retaliate.   . ,
RUSSIA  (legislation-xi In nonuuKNOE).326A new Army.-.....Mr. Lockhart telegraphed oji 20th March [No. 00j that M. Trotsky-had made an important speech in connection with the creation of a new army. The main points were : Above all we must create a real fighting army, well-disciplined, with officers and generals. The Soviet power has already given commands to a wdiole series of generals. We must not refuse services of military experts. The higher command will be responsible for the military side of the army, in which there must be severe revolutionary discipline. We must limit the elective system to uon commissioned commands: the higher commands will be appointed by the Soviet. i must state emphatically that hitherto there has been no discipline. If any unit refuses to obey the orders of the higher command, the leader of that unit must be killed immediately. Everything is not yet lost; we still have ^uns, stores, sheds. &amp;c. Now we must have discipline.
LATEST INTELLIGENCE.RUSSIA.Ratification of the Peace Treaty. -Mr. Wardrop telegraphed from Moscow on the 17th March [No. 89] that there were 1,198 qualified voters, 94 of whom had taken no part in the proceedings, and 115 others, though present, had abstained from voting ; of the remainder 704 had voted for and 285 ap-amst ratification.Arrest of Prince Lvov.

The India Office issued the following statement on the 20th March : The attitude of the Maris in Baluchistan, which has been unsatisfactory for some time, has recently culminated in a series of outrages. Aided in some cases by Khotrans, they have cut telegraph wires, fired on trains, and destroyed Government property in several localities in and adjacent to their tribal area. They also organised and carried out attacks in force on our posts at Gumbaz and Port Munro, where they were completely repulsed, and suffered many casualties.Their attitude, however, is still defiant, and punitive measures are now being undertaken against them. Our aeroplanes have on two occasions recently bombed their tribal concentrations with effect.His Highness the Khan of Kalat has very generously presented 4,000 rupees for the provision of comforts for the sick and wounded in the operations.
