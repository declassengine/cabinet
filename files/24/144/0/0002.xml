SECRET.m    em.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT, No. XXVII.Russia.THERE are now indications that Russia is tending towards a resuscitation of law, order, and discipline. The German advance and the Russian retreat appear to have combined to rob the elements of pro-G-er,nanism and anarchy of much of their popularity. It must, however, be remembered that a return of discipline to the army will be regarded by the &quot; intellectuals &quot; as partaking of the nature of &quot; reaction,&quot;* and will be resisted. However, unless some untoward event occurs, it is quite possible that, following on the exhaustion of the volcanic forces of anarchy, a period of reason will follow during which the military forces of Russia may be considerably rehabilitated.Rumania.The Rumanian situation is gloomy ; the question is whether the Russian disciplinary revival has come in time to preserve the Rumanian army from the necessity of retiring.Turkey.The news of the movement of Turkish gold to Arabia is very serious. It indicates that the Turks are now thoroughly alarmed about the Arab situation and mean to take all means to rectify their former errors.Arab r a.General Claytons letter deserves very careful perusal. It is an admirable survey of the situation. If Great Britain and France will only co-operate there are good prospects of defeating the enemy, breaking the Baghdad Railway, and ending the war with Egypt and the Persian Gulf secure from all aggression. If petty views prevail, both nations will be great losers. A few French concessionnaires may get a share of German profits, but France&apos;s iiame will be loathed and her commerce boycotted, while we shall find ourselves menaced at two vital points, with the added anxiety of a Turkish menace against Mecca. Co-operation and frank understanding are more essential to-day than ever before. If His Majesty&apos;s Government, see fit, it might be advisable to take advantage of M. Picot&apos;s visit to London to prepare a joint aide-memoire for the King- of Hejaz.Afghanistan.The Amir&apos;s concern in regard to the Russian situation should be noticed What isf going on in the great Turanian block of populations which encircles the northern frontier of Afghanistan is not known at present. If Russian power should crumble away and Turkish power once more resuscitate itself in Central Asia, both Afghanistan and India ! will be confronted with a political and military problem far more serious than any that they have hitherto had to face. A glance at the map circulated with Eastern Report No. 5, of the 28th February, will show how pan-Turanism affects the North-West Fr, mtier.M. S.August 2, 1917.T---* This most misleading word should be expunged from the political students dictionary. The anarchist who desires to return to a nut diet in the virgin forest regards policemen and ticket collectors as reactionary institutions.[898-54]

Buchanan telegraphed on the 26th July [No. 1145] saying that the Government as at present1 constituted did not represent the mass of the nation and did&apos;not inspire confidence. M. Kerensky was endeavouring to form a Government more national in its character and representing all parties, and it-was probable that MM. Tchernoff and Nekrassoff would go out. Sir G. Buchanan feared that M. Kerensky would meet with many difficulties; nearly all the best men of administrative ability were Cadets, and&apos; he Understood from M. Terestchenko that M. Kerensky would not admit M. MiliukofF, who, if passed over, might prevent any of his followers from joining the Government. There was to be a large meeting at Moscow of delegates of various organisations on Tuesday, the 30th ; Ministers were to address it and invite the co-operation of all parties, and representatives of the Executive Committee of the Sovyet and of the Committee of the Duma had been invited to go with them.Telegraphing on the 30th July [No. 1165], Sir G. Buchanan said that M. Tseretelli had been managing the negotiations in the absence of the Prime Minister, but the solution of the Cabinet crisis seemed no nearer. The Minister for the Interior contended that the programme of the old Government must be carried out&apos;by the new one ; but [? the Cadets]* maintained that the final constitution of the latter was a necessary preliminary to the settlement of the years programme. They insisted1 that all social questions should be left over for settlement by the Constituent Assembly, and that an end should be put to the class war, which was encouraged : by- the persistent preaching by the Government of the necessity of combating a counter-revolution. The former demand was directed&apos; against the agrarian policy of Ml Tchernoff [who was said by Sir G. Buchanan in a previous telegram (No. 1156) to be doing incalculable harm], and it was doubtful whether any of them would join the Government if M. Kerensky should refuse to sacrifice him.   The educated classes held the same views as the Cadets,[898-54]Words have obviously been omitted from the telegram.B
and there could be no doubt, Sir G. Buchanan said, that the &quot; reactionary&quot; movement was gaining ground. Some people, he said, believed that, as the Government was in possession and was supported by the Sovyet it would be able to count on the troops, with whom the last word rested, if the Cadets were firm they would carry the day ; this, however, he could not believe.General Komiloff and the Moscoio Press. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphing on the 26th July [No. 1145], said that a Moscow paper had published General Korniloffs letter in which he described the deplorable state of the army, and demanded that all offensives should be stopped for the present. This was done without the knowledge of the Government, according to M. Terestchenko, who admitted that it was a mistake when Sir G. Buchanan called his attention to the publication and pointed out that the Germans would as a consequence probably transfer troops to the Western front. On the following day he telegraphed again saying that a strict enquiry was being made into the circumstances by the Government, which would enforce every measure necessary to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. He had received an aide-memoire expressing the regret of the Government.Closing of the Frontiers. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 29th July [No. 1154] with reference to his telegram of the 25th July [Eastern Report XXVI, 5], that the frontiers had been closed to all but official messengers till the 15th August (k.s.). The Minister for War could grant permission to others in agreement with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.Weeldy Report of the Intelligence Bureau. Attention is called to the Report for the 30th July.RUMANIAThe Present Position.- Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 26th July [No. 392] that Romania might soon find herself faced with the alternative of making a separate peace or evacuation into Russia, as the enemy advance into Galicia and Bukovina threatened to completely isolate her. The French Minister and he himself had concerted with the liussian Minister, who was asking his Government to authorise him to take the initiative and to declare officially that if evacuation should become necessary the King would be received with all regard and consideration ; this had been clone because it was thought that the Kim;- would be reluctant to trust himself to the anarchy prevailing in Russia. Two days later he telegraphed again [No. 401] saying that at a Council of War on the 27th the King had made it clear that if necessary he would evacuate his army and that he would in no case make a separate peace. Sir G. Barclay hoped that the Russian Government would not take advantage of this to withdraw its troops from Moldavia before the doing so shotdd be a matter of necessity.Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan [No. l 582] on the 28th July, before the receipt of either of Sir G. Barclays telegrams, saying that the menace to Moldavia and the situation in the Bukovina caused great anxiety to the Rumanian Government, as he had been informed by its Minister who had asked, with a view to obtaining protection for these territories, for our intervention with the Russian Government. He said that the Rumanian offensive had had to be suspended, in consequence of the dispositions of the Russian headquarters. Sir G. Buchanan was instructed to make to the Russian Government such representations, in the sense indicated, as he might think useful. And, on the following day, having then received Sir G. Barclay&apos;s first telegram, he telegraphed again [No. 1590: instructing him to urge the Russian Government to give the desired authorisation to its Minister at Jassy.The Paris Conference. A telegram was sent to Sir G. Barclay on the 26th. July [No. 251] informing him that the Rumanian Government had bitterly complained of its purely consultative r61e which it alleged was due to the opposition of His Majesty&apos;s Government to its being allowed deliberative representation. M. Misu was assured that if any question should be raised at the conference affecting Rumanian interests the advice of the Rumanian representative would be received with the utmost friendliness and goodwill. He was also told that, the meeting being in Paris, the question of invitations had been the concern of the French Government. A telegram [No. 391] from Sir G. Barclay crossed this. He said that M. Bratiano had complained of the advisory r61e assigned to Rumania, and when Sir G. Barclay had said that he
315presumed that the other smaller Powers were in a similar position, he replied that what-ever other Powers might do Rumania would, in the future, refuse to take part, under similar conditions, in any conference.TURKEY.Ayoub Sabri [see Eastern Report XXI, 2 ; XXII, 5]. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed &apos;on the .25th July [No. 608] that Mr. Frew had been deported to the interior on. the -17th July in retaliation, he was told, for the alleged ill-treatment, of Ayoub Sabri. This was reported by the American consular officials, who had left Constantinople on the 18th July. Apparently Ayoub Sabri managed to get letters through to Constan-tinople, complaining of the treatment accorded to [ ? ]. The Americans feared that there would be further deportations in connection with the matter, in regard to which the Turks seemed to be excited.Gold for Banks. An agent has reported that on the 17th July the Weiner bank in Constantinople received l,O0O,000L in bar gold, and four times that amount was expected to arrive on the following day for the Deutsche Orient and Deutsche banks. The agent added that the gold so received was hastily minted for purchasing supplies from Arabs in Syria and Mesopotamia and. for buying over the Arabs.EGYPT.The Ex-Khedive [see Eastern Report, XVI, p. 6 ; XVIII, p. 5 ; XXI, p. 2 ; and XXV, p. 3]. An agent reports that he has received information which, after examina-tion, he believes to be correct, that Ibrahim Pasha Uilmi (brother of the Sultan of Egypt) and Arif Pasha (foster-brother of the King of Hejaz) who was master of ceremonies to the ex-Khedive, recently arrived in Switzerland from Constantinople with the object of persuading the last-mentioned to return to Turkey with a view to his being made use of to bring about a reconciliation with King Hussein (with whom he was always friendly), the Turks having recognised the magnitude of their error in regard to the Arabs. A hint has been thrown out that, should he refuse, his property in Turkey would be seized ; on the other hand, should he be amenable, the bait held out was that he would be permitted to live. as befitted his rank, and would receive a handsome allowance for that purpose. It is worthy of note that in another report made two days later, apparently by the same agent, it is noted that Arif&apos; Pasha had stated that it was firmly believed in Government circles that the Arabian question would be settled to the disadvantage of King Hussein after finishing with Mesopotamia.ABYSSINIA.The Aeroplane Question [Eastern Report, XXIV, p. 3 ; XXV, p. 4]. Mr. Balfour telegraphed oh the 27th July [No. 52] that the despatch of three aeroplanes, as suggested would, in the opinion of the War Office, not only be useless from a military point of view, but, by disappointing, expectations, would be likely to do more harm than good. A homop-eneous unit of one flight would be the smallest able to render effective assistance; and this it could not provide. Mr. Thesiger was asked whether he considered that, if the French and Italian Governments sent an adequate force, other advantages would be outweighed by the loss of British prestige ; and, if not, whether he advised their being urged to do so.ARABIA.The Arab Movement. The following letter written by General Clayton to Sir Mark Sykes was received on the 31st July: I have not written to you hitherto, as, up till recently, there has really been little to tell you. It was inevitable that your and Picofs conversations here should cause a considerable amount of stir among the various factions. The anti-French parties were especially alarmed, and entertained very exaggerated fears regarding the extent of French penetration into Syria fears which were further stimulated by ill-advised statements and propaganda on the part of the pro-French elements.I have confined myself up to date to attempting to allay the excitement provoked by assuring all that, if they wish for the support and help of the Entente, without
which they can do nothing, they must, on their part, trust to the Entente to act up to-the principles which have already been enunciated clearly in general tei^ms by British and French statesmen, and in particular by M. Picot and yourself, as regards the Arabs. They are, I think, coming into a reasonable frame of mind and beginning to realise that nothing definite can be laid down while the Turks actually occupy the soil of Palestine and Syria, and that their present duty is to unite in preparing themselves for the day when they can step forward with some practical aid. to establishing the independence and autonomy for which they clamour. There is.no real importance in their talk, but I have been somewhat apprehensive that, unless it is checked, the ground might be rendered favourable in certain quarters for the acceptance of a really attractive offer by the Turks of decentralisation and autonomy in Arabia, Syria, and Mesopotamia under nominal Turkish suzerainty. I cannot help thinking that such an offer may be made by the Turks when they realise that the game is lost, with a view to saving as much as possible out of the wreck,.and if a real fear of French designs is allowed to grow up and spread, it is possible that, in certain quarters, it might be accepted faute de mieux. The pro-French party, on their part, have not been guiltless of foolish bragging, and excessive, propaganda by which they only alarm their opponents and injure the cause which they wish to support.The future prospects of the Arab movement have assumed rather a different aspect in the light of the information, gained by Captain Lawrence during, his recent trip. There seems little doubt that the northern tribes are really ready for business, and every reason to hope that they are effective. FaisaPs name is one to conjure with and, if the general rising of these tribes is attended with the success which Lawrence seems to think, quite possible. Faisal will be regarded as the saviour of Syria. Already he is accepted in practically all the districts through which Captain Lawrence passed and by the Arab Committee of Damascus. It is, therefore, not improbable that Faisal may make good before the French can get to work, and it will then be with him that they wall have to deal. Frenchmen of the Vitale school, such as Bremond and Co.,,will be quick to see this, and may try to counter it in either of two ways : 1. By putting obstacles in Faisal&apos;s way, and trying to prevent pur supporting the movement of the northern Arabs, on the score that it is in their sphere and that we must therefore keep &quot; hands off.&quot;2. By maintaining that it is they who must run the whole movement and not us, and that it is from them that all advice and material support must come.As regards (1), I would emphasise that at present the movement of.the northern tribes is a military operation and, as. such,.an integraTpart of.the allied operations in Palestine. It is not our fault that the allied effort, in Palestine is at present a purely British one, and we should not allow questions of &quot; after the war&quot; politics to rob us of an invaluable ally in our Palestine campaign..As regards (2), the Arab movement will be largely independent and run by the Arabs themselves, and a measure of material assistance is all that they require. This can be shared between us and the French, if necessary, or even alb come from the French, but in any case, for the present, can only reach the Arabs through British sources. As regards European personnel, none is advisable or necessary at present in the north beyond Captain Lawrence, who is, of course, essential and unique. In short, it is Faisal who will run the show, and, if it succeeds to any really considerable extent (not a contingency that is out of the question), it is Faisal with whom the French must deal. My own advice to the French would be to encourage and back Faisal and the Northern Arab movement as much as possible. If he does not make good they will have done no harm, and will have secured the benefit of Arab co-operation as a military asset. If he does make good they will stand to secure his trust and friendship, and he and the Syrians in general will all the more willingly turn to France for the assistance and advice without which they cannot set up any stable form of government.I enclose copies of the last two papers which I have put up on the military aspect of the situation ; they will show you how the matter stands at present.I note that the Arab Legion will now progress. The objections to dual control put forward from here were misinterpreted by the Foreign Office, as is explained in the High Commissioners last telegram ; in any case, they are by no means insuperable, and do not weigh against the greater consideration of assisting M. Picot by every means in his present task of rectifying the agreement as regards Arabia. Faisal is also raising a trained force under Jaafar Pasha at Wejh, which will to some extent clash with recruiting for Lhe legion, but we propose moving the base now at Wejh to Akaba as soon as possible,.
;516as Akaba is obviously the base which Faisal will have to use. This will simplify matters, and in any case we can draw on a larger field for recruits than can Faisal.Lawrence is very averse to employing any trained, or semi-trained, troops with Beduins, and our experience in Hejaz leads us to agree with him. Trained troops, therefore, whether tbe legion or FaisaPs trained bauds, can only be used in securing the base at Akaba until the movement has developed sufficiently to render it possible to put them into the Hauran to support the Druses; both are suitable points, from a political point of view, at which to employ an Arab force raised under the auspices of the Entente.King Hussein is becoming very tiresome and querulous. The old man is evidently overwrought, and his habit of attending to every detail himself results in his being hopelessly overworked. Colonel Wilson suggests that Abdulla should return to Mecca. He has considerable influence&apos; with his father, and his wider experience and more modern ideas will render him much more easy to deal with.Fuad el Khatib has come to Cairo, and from conversations with him it appears almost certain that the King has not at ail understood the situation, as explained to him by you and M. Picot, regarding the future of Syria and Iraq. He seems under the fixed impression that both will fall to him unconditionally, and has given this out publicly. Of course he may be bluffing, but when it comes to the point he will inevitably maintain that his version of the interview7 is the correct one, and we have never given him anything in writing to the contrary. It is a matter for consideration whether we should not put this right by giving the King an . aide-memoire of what you actually told him&quot;. Perhaps you would think this over, and, if it is thought advisable that it should be done, the presence of Abdulla at Mecca, who is a sensible and statesmanlike man, would be an advantage. vI hope M. Picot is getting on well. I hold that a definite settlement of our predominantly-nance throughout Arabia is vital. Any doubt as to our position on the flanks of the roads Port Said-Bombay and Port Said-Basra would constitute, in my opinion, a grave danger to our whole Near-Eastern system.Red Sea Blockade. The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 25th July [413 A.P.] in continuation of his telegram of the 30th June [Eastern Report XXIV, p. 5] in regard to a request made by the Italian Government that a number of sambuks sufficient to transport 20,000 oxen should be allowed to ply between Jaizan and Massowah. The Italian consul at Aden had said that the cattle were required for the canning factory in Massowah and the resident was asking for statistics. He was of opinion that the matter had been raised with the view of keeping open unrestricted trade relations with Jaizan, and Said Mustaffa Al Idris had admitted that there were Arabs in that place working in the Italian interest. Said Mustaffa had estimated the amount of available cattle in Jaizan at 400 beasts and 2,000 sheep and goats per month; he know of only one shipload being sent to Massowah.Hejaz.The Arab Legion. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir R. Wingate on the 26th July instructing him to proceed at once with the formation of the Arab Legion. It would be formed, as originally proposed, on a co-operative Anglo-French basis. The French Government had agreed to the following provisions : (a) The force would exist primarily for the defence of Hejaz ; (b) the joint political mission attached to the G.O.C. Egypt would raise and train it; (c) King Hussein would control and pay the force when it was employed in Hejaz ; (d) if it should become desirable to employ it elsewhere, the matter would be one for arrangement between the two Powers, and the cost would be shared by them equally, the legion, however, being under the control of the general commanding the force with which it operated.Mr. Balfour added that General Clayton, acting C.P.O., should be entrusted with the British supervision and be provided with suitable officers; pending M. Picot&apos;s return to Egypt, M. Maugras had been instructed to co-operate with him.Sir R. Wingate. telegraphed on the 29th July [No. 802] acknowledging the receipt of Mr. Balfour&apos;s instructions. He proposed that the British and French officers attached to the legion should only act as advisers, and exercise, jointly, a general control, the Arab officers having, as far as possible, the executive command. He urged that this mode of dealing with the legfon would emphasise its Arab aspect, and would afford less opportunity to the native personnel of playing off the European officers against e;ich other; and further, that in regions where the presence of Europeans would be undesirable, the legion would be available fdr use under its own officers. [898-54] *&quot; -   C
King Hussein&apos;s Subsidy. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 12th July [No. 729] as to the difficulty of finding gold for the subsidy. He said that the matter was most urgent, as the effects of our inability to meet the King&apos;s monetary requirements would be little short of disastrous at the present juncture. Telegraphing again [No. 754] on the 18th July, he repeated this, and added that the effect would be hardly less disastrous on the Arab military operations, which would be particularly regrettable at a time when we were looking for tangible results from them as well as a development in the north of Hejaz. Sir R. Wingate also pointed out that, strictly speaking, the gold reserve in Egypt was the reserve of the Egyptian Government, whilst the Hejaz campaign was an imperial concern. If he were confronted with a choice between the breakdown of the latter and a grave risk of a financial erisis in Egypt (which could not be palliated if it once broke out), he could only recognise the duty of the Egyptian Government to keep its resources for the purposes for which they were intended. On the 25th July he telegraphed again [No. 785] saying that the question had reached an. acute stage, and repeating that we should be faced with disastrous political and military consequences if we failed to meet King Husseirfs requirements.It had been reported to him [Sir R.. Wingate] that during the first five months of this year about 150,000Z. in gold and 40,000L in silver had been exported from Hejaz to India, and that 70,000/. in gold was awaiting shipment at Jeddah. In view of the seriousness of the situation he was advising the King to prohibit the export of gold sent from Egypt to Hejaz, and proposed to buy it from the merchants as they received it. In order to enable them to meet their liabilities in India he should be much obliged if it could be arranged to send immediately to Colonel Wilson at Jeddah the sum of 15 lakhs of rupees in notes. On being advised that this had been done he could arrange for payment in London. Further amounts of rupee notes might be required from time to time, and it was hoped that, failing rupees, they would also serve for the purposes of currency. It would also be of great assistance if drafts could be drawn from Jeddah on Indian banks.Mr. Balfbur telegraphed on the 28th July i No. 764], with reference to Sir R. Wingate&apos;s telegram of the 18th July, saying that His Majesty&apos;s Government hoped that he would be able to obtain temporary accommodation on an assurance that His Majesty&apos;s Government would give such assistance as might be in its power should grave financial difficulties arise in Egypt, without, however, making an immediate export of gold from this country.French Detachment at Jeddah. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 26th July [No. 789] that it had been proposed that the French detachment at Jeddah should be inspected by General Bailloud, \\ hose opinion as to its continued presence in Hejaz might be required by the French Government. That being so, he saw no reason for objecting, and should probably arrange for him to be accompanied by General Clayton. In reply Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 768] his approval on the 28th July.PERSIA.The Cabinet. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 29th July [No. 270] that the Cabinet was openly flouted by the press and was losing all credit, owing to its general weakness and muddling and to its having failed to take action to suppress political assassinations. It could not, he thought, long survive, and it was possible that a new Cabinet, of much the same complexion as the last, might come into office. There were strong dissensions among the Democrats, and the efforts of our friends would be encouraged if His Majesty&apos;s Government should decide to adopt the change of attitude suggested in his telegiams of the 17th June and the 9th July [Eastern Report XXI, p. 3, and XXV, p. 5J, and a hint were given them to that effect.South Persian Rifles.- -Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 27th July [No. 264] with reference to his telegram of the 9th July [Eastern Report XXV, p. 5] saying that the Prime Minister had communicated a note to the following effect : In conversation he had frequently told Sir C. Marling that, having regard to the integrity and independence of Persia, the Government could not recognise the South Persian Rifles. The Persian Government had decided in principle the question of the organisation of a uniform force for the whole country, the details of which would in due course be communicated to him. Commenting on this, Sir C. Marling said that no such statement had ever been made to him, he had merely been given to understand that public opinion was hostile to the South Persian Rifles and that the Government would
17like to make some fresh arrangement. He thought that the objectionable form of the note (\which was apparently the work of the Cabinet) was designed to bring about a quarrel between the legation and the Prime Minister which would force the latter to resign. The Russian Minister had not received an analogous communication, though the mention of a force for the whole of Persia brought up the question of the Cossack division.Persian Baluchistan. The Foreign Office telegraphed on the 27th July [No. 212] to Sir C. Marling asking him to telegraph his views in regard to future British policy in Persian Baluchistan, a question which had been raised by the Government of India. That Government considered that the resuscitation of Persian rule in the province with our support (direct British administration being out of the question) would be the only practical solution. Since it would be useless for the Persian Government to attempt to govern it from Kerman, it would be necessary to create a separate governorship, and the Indian Government felt that a strong governor should be sent at once, it was. too, of opinion that a British officer, holding the titular post of consul for^ Baluchistan, should be sent with the governor, this officer being accompanied by a suitable escort. It further proposed that the consul should raise a force of tribal levies, 500-600 strong, nominally under the South Persian Rifles, but practically separate from them.The India Office had pointed out that this proposal would in effect restore to Persia a province which had defied its authority for ten years, but, on the other hand, it realised that it was difficult for us to obtain fresh political concessions from Persia at the present time. The conditions attached to the proposal might appear stringent, but Great. Britain had suffered severely from the breakdown of authority in Baluchistan, one of the consequences of which had been an invasion of British territory. His Majesty&apos;s Government had dealt with the situation without assistance from Persia, and was now offering to that country the fruit of its work, and to sacure that, fruit being properly utilised it must exact guarantees.Sir C. Marling replied on the 30th July [No. 271] to the effect that he doubted as to whether the proposal would ever be voluntarily accepted by any Persian Cabinet. In reply to the argument advanced, it would be said that what we had done we had done for ourselves, not for Persia, and without consulting her ; and that instead of Persian authority having been restored, British authority had been established. He feared that till circumstances gave us an opportunity of obtaining its acceptance under pressure, the scheme would have to be adjourned. He suggested that it would be better not to mention the scheme to the Persian Government if the condition of Baluchistan was fairly satisfactory. If attention were drawn to our proceedings there might be a fresh outburst of democratic anglophobia in spite of the fact that Teheran was but little interested in Baluchistan.The Imperial Bank of Persia. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 26th July [No. 262] saying that on the previous day he had sent a telegram to Petrograd saying that operations in roubles had been suspended by this bank. The reason for this was that notice that deposits could not be accepted without a preliminary sanction of credit from the Chancellery had been given by the Roisso-Asiatic Bank at 33aku, which bad, therefore, to refuse acceptance of deposits from the clients of the Imperial Bank ; Sir C. Marling had asked whether Sir G. Buchanan could obtain this permission for the agents of the bank. If the Imperial Bank had to suspend purchases of roubles, the rouble might become quite discredited in Persia : the matter was therefore pressing.Sir Charles Marling, telegraphing to the Foreign Office again on the same day [No. 263], said that the situation had become acute, If the prohibition were not removed the bank would be obliged to suspend purchases ot roubles, in which case the Russian troops would starve, as they were paid exclusively in roubles, and then there would be further troubles. The. manager of the bank had suggested that until the withdrawal of the prohibition His Majesty&apos;s Government should guarantee it against loss on the purchase of 100,000 roubles a day.Disorderly Conduct of Russian Troops [see Eastern Report XXVI, p. 6]. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 27th July [No. 1.151] that he had been&quot; informed by M. Terestchenko that as many of the Russian troops in Persia as could be spared would be transferred to the Caucasus front; he said too that orders had been sent for the adoption of strict disciplinary measures.[898-54] &apos; D
t&apos;uZs* &apos;%nS&apos;%^mJai^^ ;(.,;;, S&apos;]&apos;,&apos;The Viceroy&apos;s Monthly Report.--!Lh\e &quot;viceroy telegraphed on the 30th July, that the Amir, who implicitly identified himself with the cause of the Allies, had expressed concern at the Russian situation. It was reported that Nasrulla had told a Wazir deputation that the more we chastised the Mahsuds the better; Afghanistan, he said, would not countenance anti-British disturbances. The internal situation was the Viceroy said, quiet and normal.LATEST INFORMATION.RUSSIA.The Crisis. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 31st July [No. 1168] saying that M. Terestchenko had iiriormecl him that M. Kerensky still hoped to come to an agreement with the Cadets within the next twenty-four hours. Should he fail, he might refuse to be responsible for the government of the country any longer, and the only alternative (should M. Tchernoff not resign) would be the dictatorship of General Korniloff. Both he (M. Terestchenko) and. M. Kerensky had told the Executive Committee of the Sovyet that it was working directly for a counter-revolution by continually talking of it and by impeding the execution of orders given by the Government for the repression of anarchy, which they were warned would no longer be tolerated.The Army. Sir G. Buchanan in the same telegram (&quot;No. 1168] said that M. Terestchenko had returned from headquarters on the 30th July. Pie said that various stores of supplies had been taken by the enemy, but the losses in artillery were not so heavy as he had anticipated. The morale of the troops was bad, and the situation at the front very serious. For the purpose of re-establishing discipline the most stringent measures were being taken ; and General Korniloff, who was a strict disciplinarian, was to be Commander-in-Chief in place of General Brussiloff. The armies could not be re-formed and rendered fit to take the field in less than from two to three months. M. Terestchenko also said that General Polovtsov was to be replaced by Captain Roschakovski as military commander of Petrograd; and in regard to the latter, Sir G. Buchanan added that if he were given a free hand he was likely to maintain the strictest discipline ; he was a man of strong character and great energy.ABYSSINIA.Expulsion of Germans [Eastern Report, XXIII, p. 6 ; XXVI, p 4]. Mr. Thesiger telegraphed on the i!5th July [No. 52], saying that the Abyssinian Government washed to increase the number of rifles asked for to 30,000, of modern pattern, with 6,000,000 cartridges, and at the same time to drop its demand for aeroplanes. It also asked that it should be represented at the Peace Conference. Mr. Thesiger said that he was informing Ras that owing to the war no magazine rifles -were obtainable, and that as to the revised conditions he could not transmit them even unofficially.Lij Yasu.   Sir R. Wingate transmitted on the 1st August [No. 210] a message from Mr. Thesiger, dated the 30th July, that a part of the force of Lij Yasu had successfully reconnoitred the capital of Edjn.PERSIA.The Note [see p. 6.]. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 31st July [No. 272] saying that a short memorandum of the Persian proposals had been handed to him by the Prime Minister. It was proposed (1) that the administration of finance should be reformed by foreign experts engaged for that purpose and armed with adequate powers ; and (2) that a corps of 15,000 men should be formed for policing&apos; the roads throughout the country, the annual cost of which was estimated at 4,000,000 tomans [i.e., at the present rate of exchange about 1,330,OOOL per annum], to be found by means of a revision of the customs tariff.   The Prime Minister hoped that, by agreeing to assistI
18Persia to realise these aims, His Majesty&apos;s Government would give a further proof of its friendship. Sir George Buchanan pointed out that it was unreasonable to appeal to our friendship after having presented a note inspired by mistrust and offensive in form. Willing as he was to approach this question in a friendly spirit, that note stood in the way, and he feared that His Majesty&apos;s Government would decline to bind itself as desired till Persia&apos;s attitude in regard to the mission of Sir P. Sykes was known. The discussion was quite friendly, and the Prime Minister promised that a satisfactory note should be substituted for the one which had given offence. Sir G. Buchanan pointed out that the realisation of the programme was far off, as the revision of tariffs would be a long and complicated business ; he also, enquired as to what was proposed in regard to Southern Persia, where our interests chiefly lay.INDIA.The Mahsuds. The Viceroy telegraphed on the 31st July that the agreement had not yet been ratified by the jirga, which had not been assembled. It was believed that the maliks were actuated by a desire to ensure a final and complete settlement by collecting the full number of rifles before coming in, and that they had no wish to evade surrendering them by procrastination. They were handing them in daily, and 210 rifles (30 militia and 180 military) with 10 prisoners had been handed in by the 30th July.PRINTED AT THE  FOREIGN&quot; OFFICE BY C.R.  HARRISON.-3/8/17.
