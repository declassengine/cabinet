SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE  ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT No. XXXIV.&apos; Russia.Russia is now officially styled a Republic. The authority for the establishment of the Republic is the Provisional Government. This action has not the sanction of the foreshadowed constituent assembly; this may be important at some future date when the authority of the Republic is piestioned.Sir G. Buchanans telegram on p. 4,- No. 1456, is interesting. It is more than likely that General Korniloff acted under the stimulus of agents provocateur, who wished to abort any recrudescence of law and order.ROUMANIA.There is nothing to add to last week&apos;s comments.Egypt.Special attention is drawn to the precarious state of health in which the Sultan finds himself. His death would certainly be a great loss to this country. &quot;Che question of his successor will arouse considerable interest among the Egyptians. The present Sultan has greatly improved on his original position, but he has always been open to the taunt that he holds from a Christian Government a title which only the sanction of the Cahph, just inheritance, or the acclamation of the people can confer. Perhaps means might be found to relieve his successor of this handicap.Arabia.The effect of the King of Hejaz&apos;s proclamation on the Turkish religious leaders is very satisfactory.Abyssinia.There is every reason to be pleased at the capture of the German mission ; this crew has kept the country in ferment and caused us much trouble.M. S.September 20, 1917.

In an interview with the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, our Acting Consul-General at Moscow gave it as his opinion that General Korniloff had acted too soon, and that the probability Avas that whatever occurred immediately, the ultimate result would be anarchy and civil war.M. Kerensky was, in his judgment, a perfectly honest and straightforward man, with a genuine belief in his Socialist ideals. He was confident that he was in favour of going on with the war.He said that the behaviour of the Russian troops on their retreat in the South was appalling, and that to try to demobilise the Russian Army now would be to let loose a horde of savages without any control of them, who would rob and murder in all the villages in Russia. Until, therefore, discipline was restored no Russian could face the prospect of demobilisation.None of the Labour representatives whom we sent over to Russia was of any use there at all, except Mr. Saunders. The Workmen&apos;s and Socialists&apos; Committee practically contained no workmen, or if there were some workmen members, they took no part in the leadership of the Committee. None of those we sent over was a trained Socialist in the continental sense, they could not cope with the professors and so on who really form the backbone of the Socialist party, and the result was that they left on the minds of the Russian Socialists the conviction that they were the agents of a capitalist Government bent on a career of conquest.Mrs. Pankhurst had been a failure. She had not appreciated or understood the Russian character. She had not produced much effect one way or the other, but what little effect she had produced was bad.He was confident that ultimately a democratic solution was the only one possible in Russia, where the people were the most democratic in the world. But almost anything might happen before the final solution was reached.Asked whether there was any patriotism in Russia, he replied that there was a great deal of village patriotism, but that Russians did not really rise to the conception of any larger unity than, at the most, the district Government under which they lived.[898-61] . B
He accounted for the fact that very many of them were opposed to peace on the ground that they thought a separate peace would be dishonourable, and denied that it had anything to do with hatred of the Germans, which, he said, did not exist amongst the peasantry.2. On the 12th September Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 1435] that various papers had been attacking allied representatives in attributing to them demarches intended either to strengthen or paralyse the repression of the acts of General Korniloff. In order to dissipate all such misunderstandings, Sir G. Buchanan, acting as doyen of his colleagues, handed on the 10th September to Tereschenko a declaration to the effect that allied Powers had from the beginning restricted themselves to the offer of their good offices with a view to the avoidance of bloodshed and. civil war.Meanwhile [No. 1433] Tereschenko had informed Sir G. Buchanan that General Korniloff had definitely resigned and would hand over his command to General Alexieff in a few days. He would be tried, probably condemned to death, and eventually pardoned.Government was - to consist of twelve members, only two of whom would be Socialists.On the 14th September [No. 5293, Norway] the situation permitted of British subjects being allowed to proceed to Petrograd.Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 1442, 14th September] that the Ministry was not yet constituted, and that before consenting to retain office, Minister for Foreign Affairs insisted on assurance of open support on the part of Cadets and on immediate adoption of strong measures with regard to the army in rear. Prime Minister agreed to issue army order in sense suggested by Minister for Foreign Affairs. Latter said there was not a moment to be lost if the country was to be saved. In addition to officers killed by troops at Viborg, two naval officers had been murdered on board one of the ships of Baltic FJeet. He hoped that murderers would be shot within the next twenty-four hours. This was no time for half-measures, and, as he had told one of the Socialist Ministers, he did not care if those measures on which he was insisting did provoke Bolsheviks rising, as such rising must come and must be sternly repressed before normal conditions were restored. He was anxious that Allied Conference, which he had suggested, should meet within the next three weeks, not to discuss revision of our agreements or conditions of peace, but conditions of war and general situation, tie said that it was probable Prime Ministers reign would be over by then, but that if he himself was no longer Minister, or if Government was reconstructed, it would be in direction of the Bight and not of the Left. It was only by personal contact between allies and Russian Ministers that former would be able to get clear insight into situation. The Soviet was demanding exclusion of all Cadets from the Government and Constitu-tional Coalition Government representing solely Socialists and other democratic parties, to the exclusion of bourgeoisie. In consequence of recent distribution of arms among workmen, it could count upon support of some 50,000 to 60,000 rifles in addition to several regiments. None of the above, however, were likely to make a stand if cavalry and artillery support the Government, and if the latter act with promptitude and energy. Unfortunately, in Korniloff and Kaledin, who have been arrested, and in Krimoff, who shot himself, the party of order has lost its three strongest men, and it might be difficult to find the right man to deal with such a crisis.On the 16th September [No. 1453] the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that the principal object of Government proclaiming republic was to show that revolutionary period was now over and that a stable Government existed.The orders to army and fleet, previously reported, were not issued by the Soviet but by Bolshevik military organisation, which had been re-formed after having been suppressed in July. Government did not know where they where hidden, but they were being sought and would be arrested when found.General Kaledin had denied absolutely having ever ordered Cossacks to leave the front, and the Cossacks&apos; Council had been informed that though the Generals conduct was not satisfactory, there were obscurities connected with his case which must be cleared up by a judicial enquiry.   In the meantime he must resign his command. -On the 16th September&apos;[No. 1451] the Executive Committees of the Workmen&apos;s, Soldiers&apos;, and Peasants&apos; Council held a further meeting, in which the &quot; blind fanaticism &quot; of the Bolshevik party was violently denounced, and it was decided to summon a congress of all democratic organisations to determine the composition of an Authority Act until the meeting of the Constituent Assembly. The Soviet welcomed the proclamation of the Republic, and promised fullest support to a Government organising the defence of the country. The President announced that the Congress would meet at Petrograd not later than the 25th September.
With reference to statements in German wireless as to the origin of the war, ^  Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 15th September [No. 1444] that the statement in German wireless was a substantially correct report of what appeared in, &quot; Novoe Vremya.&quot;The &quot;Official Messenger&quot; of the 16th September [No. 1450] published a Ukase Provisional Government notifying the liquidation of the Korniloff revolt, but acknowlegement-I ing it had introduced great unrest in the country and many ranks of army and had again placed the freedom won by the revolution and the future of the country in considerable danger. Declaring it necessary to terminate existing ambiguous form of State Administration, bearing in mind the unanimity and enthusiasm displayed on the subject by the Moscow Conference, the Provisional Government declared Russia a Republic and the present form of Administration Republican. The Ukase notified the establishment of a Directorate of five, a step demanded by necessity for the adoption of immediate decisive measures towards the re-establishment of law and order in the , country, which, together with re-establishment of fighting-efficiency of army, constituted, in the opinion of the Provisional Government, the most important problem of the Government. In conclusion the Ukase expressed the conviction of Government that it was necessary to summon to its aid representatives of all classes of people, and that it would find such who would place the welfare of State above personal and party interests.On the 15th September [No. 1446] the Soviet passed resolutions by very large majorities, the most important of which were : All private land to be controlled by Peasant Committees until the Constitutional Assembly.Labour to control all production and distribution. All existing secret treaties to be invalid.Immediate proposal for universal democratic peace to be made to the people of all belligerents.Cessation of all repression against the working class organisation.Immediate abolition of capital punishment at the front, a re-establishment of complete freedom for agitation and democratic organisation in the army, the higher command of which must be purged of all counter-revolutionary elements.Immediate dismissal of State Duma.Immediate summoning of Constituent Assembly.In view of these resolutions, the delegates of Executive Committee of Social Revolutionary Party and Soviet informed Prime Minister that they would accept no Cadets or industrial leaders in the Cabinet.The Minister for Foreign Affairs called and stated to our Ambassador that the Government had decided to resist the demands, and had nominated a directorate of five members, consisting of Prime Minister, himself, Minister of War, Minister of Marine, and one other. A larger Government had also been formed. The Government had sent some of their supporters to try and split their ranks, but he did not know whether they would succeed. He expected serious trouble in the town, and considered the issue doubtful, but a decisive struggle could no longer be postponed.The Soviet also telegraphed to the Army Committees not to obey the Prime Ministers orders, and ordered some of the Kronstadt sailors to come to Petrograd.General Barter [No. 1454] telegraphed on the 16th September that be had an interview with M. Kerensky at Petrograd. The latter said that the strategical situation on the front had improved. Troops on the Riga front had re-formed satisfactorily, and officers and men were working better together along the whole Russian front. M. Kerensky stated that he was confident the army was behind him, and would obey his orders as Commander-in-Chief. He remarked, evidently with a view to eliciting a statement, that many people thought France and England were disposed to make peace with Germany and to leave Russia in the lurch. General Barter protested most emphatically against the possibility of such action on the part of Allied Powers and added that if the)&apos;&apos; could count on Russia as surely as they could count on us we should be well satisfied. M. Kerensky stated that German.peace propaganda was now being directed more to making peace with the Western Powers than with Russia, and that Germany intended to offer favourable terms to France and England at the expense of Russia. In regard to the treatment of Korniloff, he said that if the Government were weak in this instance it would be impossible to restore discipline, as soldiers were being shot at the front at the present moment for insubordination. He could not make differences between Generals and soldiers after he had reluctantly assented to the death penalty.   Such penalty would greatly weaken his authority, and would be used against
him by the Soviet. M. Kerensky considered the political situation in Finland improved, and yesterday received a deputation from the best elements of the Senate thanking him for the extension of autonomy granted to them on the 26th August. He had conferred last night with the naval chiefs, who thought a German landing in Finland this autumn improbable, as it was late in the season and violent storms were occurring in the Baltic, and the food question for a disembarking army would be too difficult. He believed, however, in the probability of the landing of a German force at Pernau, and said reliable information indicated that the Germans were preparing an offensive against Dvinska.Sir G. Buchanan considers [No. 1456 of the 16th September] that we have yet to learn the whole truth about KornilofFs ill-advisecl adventure, but it is generally admitted that he was actuated solely by patriotic motives. It is also a fact that negotiations had been proceeding between him and the Government for the despatch of troops to Petrograd to co-operate with the Government after a Bolshevik rising which was regarded as imminent. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that an important group of persons, some of whom were in his immediate entourage, had for a long time past been organising a plot for the overthrow of the Government, and had contemplated using him as their instrument. Lvoff, when he went to headquarters, gave General Korniloff to understand that he was authorised by the Prime Minister to discuss three courses with him: (1) government with M. Kerensky; (2) government without M. Kerensky ; and (3) Korniloff as dictator. Whether Lvoff wilfully misrepresented M. Kerensky&apos;s attitude; whether he was acting in collusion with those who wanted to force Korniloff &apos;s hand ; whether M. Kerensky, who regarded Korniloff as a dangerous rival, set a trap for him, as some believe; or whether there was some regrettable misunderstanding, are still disputed points. It seems probable that Korniloff was the unconscious tool of others who wished to overthrow the Government.The views expressed by M. Kerensky to General Barter about the military situation are somewhat optimistic ; nor is it quite certain if, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs told Mr. Lindley, General KaleduTs conduct is to be made the subject of judicial inquiry, he may not share Korniloff &apos;s fate. Both the Soviet and M. Kerensky have always feared that a strong army might prove a weapon in the hands of counter-revolutionaries, and any energetic General who has influence with the troops at once becomes the object of suspicion to them.On the 16th the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave Sir George to understand that the final trial of strength between the Government and the Soviet would take place that day; that all necessary military preparations had been taken, and that special precautions were being considered for protecting the Embassy. Nothing happened, and we must now await the meeting of the Democratic Congress; but whether Government or Soviet will get the upper hand it is difficult to predict. In the latter case we shall have an extreme Socialist Cabinet under Tchernoff, though it may after all end in another compromise. Should the Moderates win the day, there seemed at present nothing to confirm what the Minister for Foreign Affairs twice foretold, that M. Kerensky&apos;s reign was drawing to a close unless General Korniloff&apos;s trial should produce some compromising evidence against him. However the future Government may be constituted, there is but one course open to us, and that is to support it, if by so doing we can keep Russia in the war. If either through collapse or through machina-tions of extremists she is forced into peace, Roumania will be at Germany&apos;s mercy, and the Central Powers will gain a new lease of life owing to the vast supplies which they will be able to draw from Russia, and owing to the release of all German and Austrian prisoners of war. Even the support which the United States will be able to give us next year will not counterbalance this loss to us. Sir George does not, however, think it likely that a Socialist Government will at once make proposals for a separate peace. What he fears is that they will bring pressure on the Allies to conclude peace by threatening to make a separate peace if the Allies refuse to do so.ROUMANIA.The situation is being watched [No. 548] with grave anxiety. The Prime Minister is of opinion that M. Kerensky wall have to maintain himself by leaning more than ever on the Committees, which are already so destructive of discipline.On the 14th September Sir G. Barclay telegraphed that the Germans, in their determination to invade Moldavia, or to cut off all communication between it and Russia, never ceased from probing different points of the front in order to concentrate
their efforts on weak points. Experience of recent fighting had shown that in the north, as well as in the south, Russian units had retired, and that Roumanian troops, already so severely tried, were not numerically sufficient to relieve them everywhere. It was highly desirable to move, to the Russo-Roumanian front the Serbian Tcheck divisions formed in Russia which had been already proved, thus supplying the Roumanian army with needed reserves. Financial resources of Roumania were exhausted.Oil the 18th September the Roumanian Minister in London was informed by the Foreign Office, in reply to a note received from him, that even if, as His Majesty&apos;s Government greatly hoped, the Roumanian army by its heroic efforts succeeded in preventing the evacuation of further Roumanian territory, His Majesty&apos;s Government would still be prepared to give the most favourable consideration to Roumanian financial rerpuirements that circumstances permit.Preparations for completing the evacuation [17th September, No. 565] of Moldavia are being pressed on; but the movement of population and materials to Russia is proceeding slowly. The food situation continues to be serious owing to the failure of Russians to send the flour necessary to feed their own armies.TURKEY.Attention is drawn to the valuable and interesting note on the Turkish Pan-Turanian movement, issued by the Department of Information Intelligence Bureau (initialled A. J. T. of the 7th instant;. The memorandum summarises the history, scope, and prospects of this important political move of the Young Turks, which is, briefly, an endeavour to substitute for a necessarily Arabic-thinking Pan-Islam the principle of the victorious Turkish race.SYRIA.i...... .According to information received by the Vatican [Count de Salis, No. 47 of the 15th September], the situation of the population of Syria is becoming every day more critical owing to increasing shortage of provisions. His Majesty&apos;s Government, in conjunction with French and Italian Governments, are considering relief proposals [No. 41 to Count de Salis].EGYPT.Sir R. Wingate telegraphed from Ramleh on the 15th September [No. 971] that Egyptians would be unlikely to welcome Chinese troops in Egypt proper. Their employment would, moreover, be interpreted as a sign of British weakness. Sir Regi.ua.id therefore enquired whether General Allenby would be able to employ them on the Eastern Front or on lines of communication. General Allenby replied that he would find it difficult to maintain more troops owing to the strain on his lines of communication, whilst even to defend those lines he was quite in the dark as to their military value. He suggested their being despatched to Aden, in view of desirability of taking early action against the Turks at Lahaj.Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 18th September [No. 979] that the Prime Minister had called on him that morning and reported that the Sultan&apos;s private doctor had telegraphed urgently for his two consultants at Alexandria to proceed at once to Kafr Zayat, where His Highness is staying on his steamer. The Prime Minister proceeded with two doctors at once by special train, and would telegraph to Sir R. Wingate if His Highness&apos;s condition was dangerous. Sir R. Wingate asked if in that case he was authorised to approach his son, Prince Kemal el Din, as successor. The same night the Prime Minister informed Sir R. Wingate [No. 980] that it was -a false alarm, and that the call for doctors had been cancelled.ARABIA.Advices from Switzerland [Berne, No. 554] show that the proclamations of the King of the Hijaz have created considerable religious emotion and made a great impression on the Turks, especially among the Ulama ; those copies that had reached Constan-tinople have been the causes of differences between C.U.P. and the religious elements in the country.
Sir R. &quot;Wingate has been informed [No. 901 of the 18th September] that permission has been given for French Government to export 975,000 fr. from Egypt for use in the Hijaz, -with the suggestion that it should be given &quot;either to Sherif Abdalla or Sherif Faisal. The French Government reply that they can give no undertaking to remit the money to one of the Sherif&apos;s sons, but propose that Colonel Wilson should suggest to them it should be transmitted to whichever is most in need of it. On King Hosayn&apos;s request, M. Cherchali would then pay it to the person designated.ABYSSINIA.The German Mission has been captured and taken to Jibuti.LATEST INFORMATION.RUSSIA.,Sir G. Buchanan [No. 1468] received the Minister of Foreign Affairs on the 17th, and gave him his reasons for taking a gloomy view of the situation. . The Minister replied that this was serious, hut not hopeless. The new Government of twelve would spend the next three weeks in elaborating all measures necessary to prosecute the war. There was no danger of soldiers deserting en masse.ROUMANIA.Captain Pitts [No. 564] has made a statement regarding the food supply of Roumania, where the Russian army stopped importing corn about the middle of August, and has since been living on the country, consuming at first about 1,000 tons a day, and still requiring about 250 tons a day from&apos;&quot;Roumania.Captain Pitts suggests that Russia should form depdts of corn on the left bank of the Pruth under adequate supervision, so that Roumania can rely upon their being earmarked for her use.EGYPT.Sir R. Wingate telegraphs [No. 982] that the Prime Minister visited the Sultan on the 19th at Shubrakhit with the two consultants, and bad just verbally reported that in the opinion of the doctors the patients condition was grave. He is considerably weaker, and evidently there is some fear that the heart may give out. His condition is such that on the one hand a sudden chill or serious digestive trouble might bring about an immediate collapse, whilst on the other hand he may linger on for some time; but both the doctors and his son Prince Kemal El Din, who is with him, are pessimistic. Sir R. Wingate considers therefore that the time has come for a decision to be reached as regards the succession. He understands from the Prime Minister that the Sultan himself has not yet shown any indication of his wishes. He is of course ignorant of his serious condition, and everything is being clone to make him still hope for eventual recovery, though Rushadi Pasha thought he detected an inrpression of hopelessness and impatience.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICF.

ARABIA.The Sherifs Religious Vieics.On July 28, 1917, the Sherif of. Mecca explainer! at some length to Colonel Wilson before me his dogmatic position, lie began by sketching the original tenets of the Wahabi sect its puritanism, its literalism and its asceticism. After the Egyptian conquest of jSTejrl the sect fell away very (prickly in numbers and enthusiasm, till of late years.it was practically confined to Aridh. The Nomads, Wushm and Qasim had all weakened so much as to be practically Sunni.About four years ago there was a sudden revival. The. Sherif is doubtful as to whether this can be ascribed to Ibn Saud or not. &apos; At any rate, funds were obtained from some-where, and Wahabite missionaries went up to Qasim, amongst the Ateiba, Meteir and Sbei, and into Mecca and Taif. The first tenet of the new preachers was that the orthodox Sunnis and Shias (especially the Shias), were infidels. The Emir of Mecca was as convicted a Kafir as the Turks. The constructive side of the new creed was curious ; they preached an exaggerated fatalism : &quot; God does everything ; &quot; they forbade medicine to the sick, discouraged trade, building and forethought. A favourite saying was, &quot; If a man fall into a well, leave it to God to pull him out.&quot;The missionaries were at first successful. in great part, and the Sherif took alarm at the prospect. He sent Sicli Abdullah rapidly into Nejd, and by a, show of force recovered the Ateiba, and most of the Meteir, and bound them again to the Emirate of Mecca. He also seems to have taken steps to counter-preach the new dogmas in Qasim itself, and in a short time the second Wrahabite movement appeared to have spent itself. - It was, however, only dormant, and in the last year or so missionaries have again been issuing from Aridh, and agitating the neighbourhood.Ibn Saud has increased the unrest by his military policy. He has called out his levies two and three times in the year, discriminating between town and town ; from one he will demand a contribution of men ; and from another a composition in money. This has particularly annoyed Aneyza, Boreyda and Russ, rich and comfortable towns, fond of silk and tobacco, and not too fond of prayer. Their disaffection is wide, and the Sherif regards it as an embarrassment, since his ambitions extend to the limits of the Ateiba and Meteir only, and he has no desire to be involved in any question of the suzerainty of the Qasim towns. At present there is a sharp cleavage between Aridh and Qasim, which any external encouragement, or un-wise internal act, might inflame into an open breach.We then asked the Sherif about the position of the Shias. Towards the W^ahabis, he said, they were extremely hostile. Other than that, he could not see in them any particular policy.
They loved his family, since Shias have a greater respect for the person of the Prophet than have the Sunnis. Some such as the Zeidis and Jaafaris were, in his opinion, more reasonable in their attitude than the Shafeis who oppose them. The Hanefite objection to the Shias was political and not doctrinal.He, in common with all orthodox islam, was not prepared to deny the Khalifate of Abu Bekr, and regarded the Shias who condemned Abu Bekr, Omar and Othman, as mistaken. The Shias in India are largely heretical in their views, as are many of the Persian sects.(The Sherif is ostensibly a Shafei. In this conversation be took up a middle position between moderate Shia and Sunni ; it is generally believed that his real beliefs are Zeidi. Sidi Abdullah is nearly openly a Shia of the Jaaferi wing ; Sidi Ali is a Sunni, and a fairly definite one ; Sidi Feisal is not a, formalist, and tends to an undefined undogmatic position, more Shia perhaps than Sunni, but vague. They are all nervous of betraying their real attitude, even to their friends, and maintain a non-committal Shafei profession in public.)I then mentioned to the Sherif that the Northern Arabs commonly called him Emir el-Muminin, and asked him if this title was correct and if it met with his approval. After a short reflection he said &quot; No&quot; and made bis refusal more definite later. He said that people ascribed to him ambitions which he did not possess ; lie had even heard talk of his reviving the Khalifate. He explained his position with regard to the Khalifate. It was the simple Shia one (already impressed on me by Feisal and Abdullah), namely, that the Khalifate expired with Abu Bekr, and that any resurrection of the idea to-day was not only7 grammatically absurd but blasphemous. He will have absolutely no truck with such a notion. (Sidi Abdullah is weaker than his father in this respect. If he saw profit: from the Sunni side in the assumption, he might do it, and cut the loss of the Shia element ; 3&apos;et, as matters stand, if the decision lies with him it is improbable that it will ever be adopted.) The idea of a Moslem Khalifate was, said the Sherif, suggested to Abdul IIamid by the British, and exploited by him as a sti:k to beat us with. Its exponents to-day were Obeidullah, Abd el-Aziz Shawish, Shekib Arslan, and Assad Shucair, four blackguards without an ounce of Islam or honesty between them, and its nominal holder, the Sultan of the Turks, was a pitable laughing-stock ; the invention had been fatal to Islam ; it tried to twist a religion into a political theory and was responsible for unrest in Turkey, Arabia, Egypt, North Africa, Java, India and China. It had plunged Turkey into the present war, and caused the Arab revolt, and with this example before his eyes, and in view of his own policy of friendship with Great Britain, he could neither acknowledge another&apos;s Khalifate, assume one himself, or admit the existence of the theory.The title Emir el-Muminin was one that a sincere Moslem might adopt.   It made no pretence to any succession to the
costs ensure his shaping his conduct exactly in accordance with his promised word. It would be easy to influence him in coming to a decision, but once his mind is made up it would be a thank-less task to try and make him change it.He appears to hope that, by ignoring the political disinte-gration of: Islam, he may be able to concentrate attention on its&apos; dogmatic differences and do something to reduce the friction between sects. His appeal would be to moderate Surini and moderate Shia to meet together under his presidency, and try to restrain the extremists in their camps.T.E.L.The Occupation of Akaba.The following account by Captain Lawrence supplements information already given on pages 307-308 above. The irregularity of the Hejaz mail service is responsible for the delay in its publication : By Monday, June 18, we had enrolled 535 Toweiha (of whom twenty-five were horsemen), about 150 Rualla (under Benaiah ibn Dughmi, Durzi&apos;s brother) and Sherarat (under Geraitan cl-Azmi), and thirty-five Kawachiba, under Dhami. Of these we chose nearly 200, and left them as guards for the tribal, tents in Wadi Sirhan. With the rest we marched out of Kaf in the afternoon, and on June 20 entered Bair, after an easy but waterless march over the Suwau. At Bair we found one well filled in, two seriously damaged, and a fourth unhurt : the Turks had come there a tittle time before with Hamd el-Arar, and tried to blow them in with gelignite. They used an electric exploder clumsily, and we removed many tamped charges from the sides of the still open wells.Circumstances forced us to stay in Bair till Thursday June 28. The time was spent in negotiations with Ibn Jazi and the smaller sub-sections of the Howeitat on the Akaba road. We also carried out demolitions against the railway at Atwi, Sultani, Minifir. and elsewhere. The Ageyl dynamitards were inefficient, and our supply of dynamite small, so that the demolitions were of a pin-prick character, meant only to distract the Turks, and advertise our coming to the Arabs. The staffs of two stations were killed, to the same intent.From Bair we marched to El-Jefer, where we stayed till July 1. The Turks had been more successful in their efforts against the wells here, and we had some difficulty in digging one out. Idie water proved sufficient for about 300 men and camels, when it was obtained. The station buildings of Maan and Hamra arc visible from El-Jefer, about twenty-four miles
off, but the Turks did not realise that we had arrived in force, owing to the operations near Amman, undertaken at this time by a flying column of 100 men, under Sheikh Zaal. This led them to believe us still in Wadi Sirhan, and on the 30th they sent a force of 400 cavalry with four machine guns, and Nawaf ibn Shaalan as guide, from Deraa to go to Kaf and find us. The Turks seem unable to discriminate the true from the false, out of the flood of news unquestionably brought them by the local Arabs.From El-Jefer a flying column rode to Fuweilah, about seventeen miles south-west of Maan, and in concert with the Dhumaniya Iioweitat (Sheikh Gasim) attacked the gendarme post on the motor roacl to Akaba. In the fighting some mounted gendarmes got into a group of undefended Howeitat tents, arid stabbed-to death an old man, six women and seven children, the only occupants. Our Arabs in consequence wiped out the; post, but not before some had escaped to Maan.This news reached Maan at dawn on the 1st, and a battalion of the 178th Regiment which had arrived at Maan from Zunmil-dak on the day before, was immediate])7 ordered out to Fuweilah to relieve the post. The same afternoon we descended on the line at kilometre 479, near Ghadir el Haj, and carried out exten-sive demolitions till nearly sunset, when we marched westward, intending to sleep at Batra. On the way, however, we were met by messengers from our Fuweilah column, reporting the coming of new troops from Maan, and we swung northwards, marching a great part of the night, till We were able at dawn to occupy the crests of the low rolling grass-covered hills that flank each side of the Akaba road, near Ain Aba el-Lissan. The Turks had reached Fuweilah, to find only vultures in possession, and moved to Aba el-Lissan, fourteen miles from Maan, for the night. The spring has been built round, and piped, and is much smaller than it used to be before the war, but is still sufficient for perhaps 2,000 men and animals. The battalion camped next the water, and kept together in the bottom of the valley, so that we were able to take the higher ground (at from 400 to 600 yards range) without difficulty.We sat here throughout July 2, sniping the Turks steadily all day, and inflicted some loss. The Turks replied with shrapnel from a mountain gun, firing twenty rounds, which were all they had. The shells grazed our hill-tops, and burst far away over the valleys behind. When sunset came, Auda Abu Tayi collected the fifty horsemen now with us, in a hollow valley about 200 yards from the Turks, but under cover, and suddenly charged at a wild gallop into the brown of them, shooting furiously from the saddle as he came. The unexpectedness of the move seemed to strike panic into the Turks (about 550 strong), and after a burst of rifle fire, they scattered in all directions. This was our signal, and all the rest of our force (perhaps 350 men, for some were Avatching the road on the east) dashed down the hillsides into the hollow,
.)0(1  as fast as the camels would go. The Turks were all infantry, and the Arabs all mounted, ancl the mix-up round the spring in the dusk, with 1,000 men shooting like mad, was considerable. As the Turks scattered, their position at once became hopeless, and in five minutes it was merely a massacre. In all I counted. oOO enemy dead in the main position, and a. few fugitives may have been killed further away, though the majority of our men went straight for the Turkish camp to plunder it, before the last shots were fired. The prisoners came to 100 (three officers), mostly taken by Sherif jSTasir arid myself, since the Arabs in the Maan area are very bitter against the Turks, and are set on killing all the)&apos; can. They have some reason for this attitude, in the slaughter of the women and children mentioned above, and in the previous execution of Sheikh Abd el-Rahman, a Belgawiya from Kerala He was popular, ancl anti-Turk, but the Govern merit caught him, and harnessing him between four wild mules tore him to death: This was the culmination of a, series of executions by torture in Kerak, and the memory of them has embittered local opinion.The Arab losses in. the fight came to two killed (a Rualla and a Sherarat) and several wounded, including Sheikh Benaiah ibn Diighuii. Considering the amount of firing, the confusion, the close quarters at which we were, and the Turkish casualties, the Arabs must be held to have got off very luckily. Several horses were hit in the cavalry charge, and Auda himself (in front, of course) had. a narrow escape, since two bullets smashed his field glasses, one pierced his revolver holster, three struck his sheathed sword, and his horse was killed under him. He was wildly pleased with the whole affair.Unfortunately, many of our prisoners were wounded and we had very few spare camels with us. Those who could hold on were mounted behind Arabs on the spare camels ; but we had to abandon the worst cases at Aba el-Lissan, and of those we took with us about fifty died of heat, hunger and thirst on the road down to Akaba. The heat in the Hesuia and Wadi Itm was terrible, and. the water between Fuweilah and Akaba only sufficient for perhaps 200 men and animals. For the matter of food, Nasir and I had taken two months&apos; supply with us from Wejh, and were now two months out ; the Bedu had their own food with them in their saddle bags, but Arab rations are ill-adapted, in quality and quantity, for Turkish soldiers. We did what we could for the prisoners, but everybody went short.From Aba el-Lissan we marched to Guweira (22 miles) &quot;after sending out a column which destroyed Mreiga, the nearest gendarme post to Maan, on the Akaba road. At Guweira we received the surrender of the garrison (of about 120 men), their intermediary being Hussein ibn Jad, Avho joined us here on July 4. The motor road is finished to the foot of Nagb el-Star, from Maan, but not metalled anywhere. As the soil is fairly hard  loam,  I  think  it should  suffice  for the
passage of a series of light cars. The Nagb is very steep, with bad hairpin corners, and will require improvement. The Hesma is of line red sand, soft along the track, but harder in the heel of the watercourse which runs clown from the foot of the Nagb to Guweira. From Guweira we marched down Wadi Itm to Kethira (18 miles) where we overran a Turkish post of about seventy infantry and fifty mounted men, taking most of them prisoners, and thence we went on to near Khadra, at the old stone dam in Wadi Itm (15 miles), where we came into contact with the garrison (300 men) of Akaba. They had retired here from the village itself (about six miles away) to be out of view of the sea, and on the line of retreat towards Maan. The news of our fight at Fuweilah had reached Akaba quickly, and all the Amran. Darausha, Heiwat and sub-tribes of the Howeitat near Akaba had risen, and collected round the Khadra post, which had held them at bay from their trenches with small casualties for two days. When Nasir and the banner turned up the Arab excitement became intense, and preparations were made for an immediate assault. This did not fall in with our ideas, since (jjour encourager-rtvjtr les autres) we wanted the news to get about that the Arabs accepted prisoners. All the Turks we met were most happy to surrender, holding up their arms and crying &quot;Muslim, Muslim&quot; as soon as they saw us. They expressed themselves williha: and anxious to go on fighting foreigners and Christians till the)7 dropped, but with no Intention of adding a Moslem enemy to the powers already against them. To save the Khadra garrison from massacre Sherif Nasir had to labour from after-noon till dawn, but he eventually carried his point (by our going ourselves between the Arab and the Turkish lines, to break their field of fire), and with the prisoners (now about 600 in number) we marched into Akaba, on the morning of July 6. The asto-nishment of a German N.C.O. (well-boring at Khadra) when the Sherifs force appeared was comic. He knew neither Arabic nor Turkish, and had not been aware of the Arab revolt.The situation at Akaba was now rather serious, economically. We had no food, 600 prisoners and many visitors in prospect. Meat was plentiful, since we had been killing riding camels as required, and there were unripe dates in the palm groves. These saved the day. but involved a good deal of dis-comfort after the eating, and the force in Akaba was very unhappy till the arrival of H.M.S. &quot; I) idler in &quot; on the 13th with food from Suez, lief ore she arrived, Arab forces were sent northward to occupy the hills up to Wadi- Musa (Petra), some sixty miles from Akaba, and southward to join up with the Beni Ativeil, and reconnoitre the country with a view to an eventual offensive against the railway south of Maan.
NOTES.Abyssinian News.The Bit waded, Haili Giorgis (p. 152), was&apos; arrested and chained on July 11, by order of the Empress and lias Taffari, and instructions issued to seize all his property. From an early hour, the Ghebbi was filled with troops, and the Bitwadcd was then summoned to attend the council, and, on his refusing to come, on the plea of ill-health, lias Deinissie was sent with a strong force to bring him. The arrest was made without any incident.Relations between Ras Taffari and Haili Giorgis have been strained since the Revolution. For.eight years, the Bitwaded, thanks to his undoubted intelligence, had held the reins of government irr his own hand, which meant complete liberty to further his own financial interests, and he had evidently determined to make his support of the new government conditional on his being allowed to retain his power. To this Ras Taffari would not consent, and not only declined to bring him in to his intimate councils but deprived him first of the controllership of the railway, and then of the governorship of the market. It was the Bitwaded&apos;s refusal to hand over this offer to his successor that furnished the ostensible reason for his arrest. The real reasons were no doubt his opposition to the assumption of authority by Ras Taffari, and the suspicion, under which he has recently fallen, of communicating with Lij Yasu.The general result of this incident, is likely to be satisfactory It is the first trial of strength between Ras Taffari and his ministers, and the fact that he has been able to crush the Bitwaded will raise his prestige with a people who despise weakness.A telegram from Adis Abeba, dated July 30, reports that a part of Lij Yasu&apos;s force has left Magdala and occupied the capital of Edju.Lij Yasu has left a garrison at Magdala, but his own where-abouts are not stated. There is iro news of the movements of the Government troops who were surrounding Magdala (p. 295), but they have presumably abandoned the siege and dispersed.Ras Hailu of Gojjam (p. 316), during his recent visit to Adis Abeba, is reported to have strongly advised the Government to put an end to German and Turkish intrigues in Abyssinia.The Ansariyah.The following additional information has been received about the Ansariyah (see Nos. 54 and 56 of the Bulletin) :-The most important tribes among these people are the Mhclba and the Kalbieh. The chief of the former is Khair Bey, a man of forty-eight years, who lives at Kalaat el-Mhelba.     The
Government made him chief of the Ansariyah volunteers, and he has under his control various other tribes such as Hamarra, Darussi, Beit el-Benar, Beni Ali, Beit Yashuta, Beit el-Hadad, Metaura, Beit el-Khayat and the inhabitants of the Latakiya Plain. He is reputed to be an Anglophile and to have been on good terms with the British Consular Agent before the war. The second most important individual in the tribe is his cousin, Shakir Derwish Aga Kb.air Beg, who is about fifty-five years old and lives at El-Fakhra. The Mhelba with their subordinate tribes number about 4,000 males, of whom about 150 or 200 are armed, mostly with Greek Gras rifles, and are excellent shots. Their sympathies, like those of the Kalbieh, are said to lie with the rich and the strong ; but especially with the rich, among whom&apos;they reckon the British and the French.-The Kalbieh are reported to he able to put 2,000 men into the field, of whom a few are armed with Mausers, and are a more efficient lighting force than the Mhelba. Their chief is Aziz Ismail, who also controls the people of Karahla, Nuasra, Rashauna, Jalkish, Jehni and Beit Mohammed.Abdullah Ibn Dakhil.In the last Bulletin (p. 330) we referred to the intrigues of a certain Ibn Dakhclivi in connection with the relations between King Husein and Ibn saud, We are now informed that the real name of this man is Abdullah ibn Dakhil, one of the sheikhs of Russ, in Qasim, and that he was formerly an envoy from Sherif Feisal to Nuri Shaalan and Ibn Rashid. He recently left Wejh, having made himself highly unpopular there as commander of the Ageyl, and was sent to Mecca, where he had nothing to do. Soon after this the King received the letter, (see p. 314) in which Sherif Abdullah mentioned Ibn Saud&apos;s intention of making the pilgrimage, and advised the King not to allow him to do so. This letter was followed immediately by a letter from Sherif Feisal, giving the same information and the same advice. Feisal added that he had received the information in a letter from Ibn Dakhil at Mecca, and there is little doubt that Abdullah&apos;s informant was the same. The story, as presented to Feisal, not unnaturally aroused his suspicious. It was, according to King Husein&apos;s statement to Colonel Wilson, that Ibn saud had sent messengers to his agents and friends in Mecca and Jeddah, ask-ing them what his reception would be if he came to Mecca at the forthcoming pilgrimage season, and that the answers were that he should come with his men and that he would find no force in Southern Hejaz to interfere in any way with his liberty of action.The King, as soon as he received feisal&apos;s letter, sent for Ibn Dakhil and asked for an explanation. Ibn Dakhil replied that he had sent no such letter to Feisal. The King &quot;said that he preferred to take FeisaPs word for that, and threw Ibn Dakhil into prison.
Capture of Teima.The capture of Teima, by the local Anazeh, reported on page 330, is likely to lead to their more effective co-operation with the Sherif. They recently held up a caravan from Hail, consisting of artillery, troops and supplies, but not being in sufficient strength to attack, they merely7 demanded and were given forty rifles. The Turks are believed to be seriously alarmed at the prospect of Teima being used as a base for attacks on the railway, and may be expected to make a determined attempt to recapture it and chastise the Anazeh. The Turkish officers at Hail are reported to be short of cash, as Ibn Rashichs grandmother, who has pro-British sympathies, holds the purse strings and refuses to provide him with funds.Hejaz Intelligence.The Akaba situation shows little development. The Turkish force that occupied Fuweilah (strength about two battalions with some hundreds of mounted men) has not attempted any forward move. As far as Aba el- Lissanand Fuweilah, the road from Maan to Akaba runs over open rolling country, affording little oppor-tunity for the exercise of Arab tactics, and the water supply at Aba el-Lissan is enough for perhaps 5,000 men. After Fuweilah the road descends the steep Nagb el-Star (dropping nearly 2,000 feet in a zigzag road of about four miles) and then runs over the sandy plain of El-his majesty&apos;s , which is studded with precipitous rock-pinnacles of red sandstone. Behind one of these, at Guweira (twenty miles from Fuweilah) are the present headquarters of Auda Abu Tayi, who has about G00 Howeitat with him. The water at Guweira lies in two side valleys to the north, and is^sufficient for about 2,000 men, but difficult of access. After Guweira the Akaba road runs up a broad valley to a watershed, ancl then runs for twenty miles through the gorge of Wadi Itin, a. watercourse from forty to 300 yards wick-, with cliff sides 300 to 3,000 feet high serrated and broken in the wildest way. The bed is rough underfoot, turns and twists through the hills, and has no water supply in it, though weak springs exist in side ravines, from one to three miles off the road.The Arab tactics are to allow the Turks to advance to Guweira and beyond, sniping them when possible, and cutting off patrols and supply caravans. In Wadi ltm itself thej7 would hold all the water sources strongly and occupy the hills each side of the main valley. The Turkish problem is to carry enough water from Aba cl-Lissan to Akaba (fifty-five miles) to support the relatively con-siderable body of troops necessary to force Wadi I tin, ancl maintain itself before Akaba, where the wells, being all under machine gun fire from the sea, cannot be relied on as available for an attacking force. A hurried Turkish advance on Akaba is therefore hardly to be looked for, as it is impossible unless the Turks can persuade a sufficient number of the Slierifian Arabs to cease fiffhthiff, and
gather quantities of camels from the Tnrcophil Arabs. They have made efforts in both directions, but so far without much success. Aucla Abu Tayi remains unshakeably Arab, and he commands a following so long as he remains in the field. He has lately sent Mohammed el-Dheilan to near Ghadir el-Haj (a bridge and about forty rails cut), Auda ibn Zaal to near Batn el-Gbul (two bridges blown up), and Zaal Ibn Motlog to Aneze (a bridge destroyed). These raids were to distract the Turkish attention from the Fuweilah district, and something on a larger scale will be attempted as soon as more materials are available. A compound Garland mine at Atwi shattered the firebox of the leading locomotive, and overturned the second, of a double-engined train.Turkish aeroplanes have made many short flights over Auda&apos;s forces (inflicting one casualty and causing panics) but have not been able to visit Akaba again.Further details have been received about the attacks on the railway reported in the last Bulletin. On July 28, Sherif Feisabs force destroyed 1,000 rails between Bedai and Bir Gedid. At Seil Matara Sherif Sharraf captured fifty prisoners, including three officers. On July 31, Jaafar Pasha&apos;s force had a twelve hours&apos; fight with the Turks at Zurnrud, where the Egyptians occupied a fort two miles from the station for some days. The result of the fighting was indecisive, but the Turks were driven back and lost about fifty killed and wounded and fifty prisoners. The Egyptians had two wounded and two captured, and the Arabs about fifty killed and wounded.Between Hedieand Muderij a party under Major Joyce and a Sherif destroyed over&apos; 700 rails (four kilometres) on July 27 ; the enemy attacked from each station but were held off until the demolition was complete.Another raid by Sherif Abdullah&apos;s forces was carried out on August 2 between Toweira and Way ban, where about 1,400 charges were exploded and about six kilometres of railroad, includ-ing seven culverts, were thoroughly demolished. In an engagement near Toweira the Arabs lost one man killed and claim to have killed thirty-three Turks. Both of these raids were carried out by day.Emir Fcisa.1, a Sheikh of the Jerba Shammar, has arrived at Mecca with thirty-five followers and offered his services to the Sherif. The latter is arranging for him to return shortly to Mesopotamia and has recommended him to visit the G.O.C., Baghdad, with a view to assisting the operations of the British on the Tigris.

ARABIA.Hejaz.Intelligence.Several minor raids, at various points on the railway from Tebuk to Jedalia, have taken place since those recorded in the last Bulletin. Over one hundred rails were destroyed between Hadiyah and Jedaha on August 15. An engagement took place on August 17 at kilometre 1,120, near Muderrig, without result. South of Wadi Ethil patrols were ambushed by the Arabs, but Turkish reinforcements are said to have surrounded the latter, killed four and captured sixty. Patrols were attacked between Dar el-Haj and Mustabgha on August 18, and a north bound train was unsuccessfully attacked between Dar el-Haj and Bir Hurmas.Ibn Rashid arrived at Medain Saleh on August 17 with about 1,000 men, 100 horses, and, according to one report, 500 camels. The Emir was accompanied by Abd el-Hamid, delegate of the Ivth  Army, and Reshid Pasha, who is described as his Agent-General, and who intends to proceed to Damascus to report. He was welcomed by the G.O.C., Composite Force, and a council of war was held.It is reported that the Shammar and Anazeb tribes have seceded from Ibn Rashid owing to his recent reverses. Most of the men of Hail refused to accompany him, and those who did so were only induced to come on the pretext that thej&apos; were to recapture Teima. The Turks fully realize the importance of restoring his prestige, and are believed to be preparing for an expedition against Teima, no less on political than on. military grounds.The Turks are reported to have made an agreement with the Huteim tribe, according to which the Huteim will, among other conditions, drive the Sherifian Arabs out of the Medina-Hanakiyah area, keep open the Medina-Nejd road, and protect caravans and guard the railway from Hadiyah to Medina. The Turks under -take to give free monthly supplies to all the Huteijn Sheikhs, who are. now at Medina awaiting ratification of the agreement.In a military sense the situation in the Akaba district has undergone no great change. The Turks are still in the near neighbourhood of Maan, to which, apparently fearing an attack, they retreated from Fuweilah some ten days ago, and the forces of Auda Abu Tayi, supported by some 300 to 400 trained troops under Rashid Effendi and a French machine gun section, are at G iiweira. Politically, however, things are moving. The occupation of the place by the Arabs has raised Akaba to a position of considerable political importance, affording as it docs an alternative means of contact with the Eastern Syrian tribes to the routes through the British sphere south of Gaza and through the Arab sphere from the Hejaz, as&apos;:well as a base for further operations against the railway and for political activity among the local tribes.   Sherif Nasir has remained there since his descent on the
town with Auda Abu Tayi on July 6, holding a series o  recep-tions of local sheikhs, processions of whom, with their followers, attended by much expenditure of ammunition in feu de joie, flow daily in and out. His position as Sherifian representative has now been taken by Emir Feisal himself, who, long and impatiently expected, at last made his appearance with Jaafar Pasha and his trained force from Wejh on August 23. Auda, who had previously visited Nasir and satisfactorily explained the conduct to which Nasir had, as mentioned on page 322, taken exception, at once came in to pay bis respects, and there are indications that the presence of the Emir will have a widespread influence on the attitude of certain Sinai tribal sections, who have hitherto shown coolness to ourselves.&apos; As regards local conditions of the population, which normally amounted to about 600, less than forty males remain, destitute of everything, while, as the result of continuous bombardments at Italian, French and British hands, the town itself is only a mass of roofless ruins.Meanwhile, much has been done, partly by the crews and partly under the supervision of the successive warships stationed at Akaba, to prepare the place for future operations. A jetty has been constructed for landing supplies on a road constructed along the beach for evacuating them. Further operations to improve and extend these works are already in progress under the super-vision of a French engineer officer and his unit.Journey to Abu Markha.The following extracts are taken from a report by Bimbashi Garland on his recent journey from Yambo to Abu Markha (see last Bulletin) : The difficulties I. experienced during this trip afford so good an example of those under which one has to work in this country that they are probably worth recording.Upon my arrival at Yambo, I speedily fixed up with Sheikh Abdel Kader for my departure, and the following day he presented to me Sherif Abdul Kerim ibn Turk, -who, he said, was to accompany me. I arranged for a riding camel each for my servant and myself, and two baggage camels for my tent, kit and two months&apos; food.On the evening of starting, two riding camels turned up  indifferent beasts and the two baggage camels. The Sherif was present with two camel men, one for the riding camels and the other for the baggage. At the last moment, Sheikh Abdel Kader said there would be three other camels going with us,
&quot; Third])7, you should befriend&apos;yourself with the Sherif, as it is necessary to help him. Any Arab who does not help him, it is far better for one to keep aloof from him. He, the Sherif, is a member of our alliance.&quot; If you accept these conditions, be sure that you will get whatever you ask. Had the object been a personal motive or self-interest between myself and yourself, I tell you by God the Great that I want your peace. . But by God I do not intend but these conditions, ancl I will not withdraw them, even at the risk of my life.&quot;There are two reasons : firstly, that I have given word to that effect and my word cannot be changed ; ancl secondly, by God I have never known any more bitter enemy against our religion and the Arabic element than the Turks, and whoever possesses Muslim zeal and Arabian honour will fight them. If you accept this, I promise you what you require. Give us binding and bonds to this effect and you may come with Salih al Hadhdhal to take agreement accordingly. If, however, you do not accept, God will decree in what lies good for us (and He will save us from your evil and we do not depend upon our efforts only). This is what had to be mentioned. Please give our salaams to brothers. From here our brothers and sons send you compliments.   May you be ever preserved.&quot;Letter from Ibn Rashid to Ibn Saud dated May 20.&quot;I have received your esteemed letter dated the 22nd Rajab, 1335 May 14, 1917), and duly understood its contents. The terms which you have mentioned are not agreeable to the interests of our religion as well as pur world ; the matter there-fore stays where it was. May it be known to you. From me salaams to brothers ancl sons.   My sons send you compliments.&quot;MESOPOTAMIA.The Najaf-Karbala District.The following notes are taken from a report dated July 2, 1917 :-For nearly two years before the capture of Baghdad the Euphrates below Musaiyib had been out of Turkish control. In May, 1915, immediately after the battle of ShuVibah, an attempt was made by the Turks to master the towns of Karbala and Najaf, which besides being exempt from conscription were harbouring Turkish deserters. It resulted in street figthing in Najaf, but in the end the Turks were obliged to give way ; the government of the two towns was taken over by the town Sheikhs, ancl Ottoman authority was for the time being withdrawn in all but the name. The elements of disunion in the countryside were, however, largely in favour of the Turks. The Mujtahids were jealous of the Sheikhs, -who were jealous of one another. Still more acute was the rivalry between  the towns and the. tribes
taking private stores for Sherif Abdullah, in charge of a native. This I took to be our complete party, and I had previously expressed a wish to Abdel Kader not to accompany any large party of hamla.We started from the house in Yambo at 6.45 p.m., but on arrival at the town gate we were stopped by the watchman for half an hour, as lie would not let the baggage, pass through without a pass from Abdel Kader. One did not resent this, as it appeared to indicate that some system of control existed, a feature to be encouraged at every opportunity in this country.On getting outside the gate, I found our party attached to a caravan of about thirty baggage camels, carrying water-tanks, ammunition, etc. The Sherif was nowhere to be seen, and on enquiry I was told by my camel man that he had changed his mind about coining. If anything, I was relieved at this, as on former occasions I had found sundry Sherifs an impediment and was generally able to get along faster without one. This one was an old man, pleasant enough, having three teeth, a penchant for cognac, and not much &quot;nafas&quot;; I foresaw that he would always favour long halts.On remonstrating with my camel man. as to our proceeding with a caravan, he said we could detach ourselves if we wished, but as our two camels were tied up and mixed with the remainder, it would be better to do- it next day.After going slowly along for about two hours and the Hejaz hamla has acquired the art of going slowly to perfection  stopping many times to pick up dropped cases and so forth, I noticed the caravan was developing a strong tendency to zig -zag. I went to the leading camel man and found him- in an ominous low-toned consultation with another one as to where the road lay. One head-strong youth swore he knew the way and forthwith took us along a route that was obviously wrong, but my pro-testations were useless.The zig -zagging got more pronounced, and when I found we had been, on the way over three hours with no apparent progress, I stopped the caravan, for enquiry. I ascertained that we were quite lost, though only about five miles from Yambo. the lights of which could not be seen. Not a single camel man knew where the road lay, nor would anyone admit that he was the head man of the party.I decided to camp where 1 was for the night with my bag-gage, leaving the rest to do as they liked, and the following morning to return to Yambo for a guide.The next morning, however, we saw the path quite close to us, and my camel man implored me not to go to Yambo because it would mean trouble for him, and as he said he knew the way perfectly from jSTakhl Mubarak, which we should now reach in daylight, I agreed not to return, but I. many times regretted afterwards that I did not.   My camel man. was a highly-skilled
but overpaid liar. He was endowed with a measure of. cunning far beyond his years, and 1 soon learnt that any proposals he put forward as being the best for my comfort were those most suited to his own convenience and desires.After trudging through the heat of the clay from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m., we reached Nakhl Mubarak, and 1 then told my camel man I wished to proceed the next morning about four o&apos;clock.When I awoke that morning there was no sign of movement, and when I shouted to the men to get ready they said the bag-gage camels were absent, having been taken into the village by the man in charge. I sent my man-servant to warn him to get ready, but he returned saying he had found with the camel man a Sherif (Sherif Sultan Abdalli), who had turned up during the night and was in charge of the party. The servant said Sherif Sultan told him that we should not move off till the evening (winch meant a clay and night&apos;s idleness for me at Mubarak), and that when he asked the Sherif to come to see me, as I was keen on starting forthwith, he only used insolent language and said that I was merely a servant of the Grand Sherif just as he was. However, he did eventually come to see me. He is something between a Becluin and a townsman, about twenty-four years of age, with a facial physiognomy of a most impudent type. To indicate his Sherifial dignity, I suppose, he carried a sword; but his clothes were Becluin. He would not listen to my requests for my party and our two bagga&quot;ge camels to proceed at once, or that we should form a. separate party. He said I might ride on if I liked, but the baggage would go with the caravan. We left at dusk. It was impossible, of course, for me to crawl along at the rate of baggage camels and so I decided to get on in front, then halt for sleep and overtake the baggage in the morning. We overtook it at Kheif Hussein, the caravan having done only eighteen miles in twenty-four hours.Sherif Sultan never got his caravan off before seven o&apos;clock of an evening, whereas we noticed other caravans started by 5.80 or 6 p.m, The next night the arrangement did not work so well. My camel man had assured me that he knew the road the baggage would take (there being a choice of three routes over this piece of country). We did not see our baggage again for forty-eight hours. The caravan took a different road. For that period I was perforce on a very low diet, my food and cooking-pots being with the baggage. The following morning the bag-gage caught us up, and we camped at El-Dom. Here the Sherif had the effrontery to approach me saying. &quot;What about my backsheesh ?&quot; To have a three days&apos; journey unnecessarily dragged out into six, to be treated to insolence and disregarded in my every wish, and then to be. asked for a gratuity was almost too much.That night we were to start what I expected to be our final stage, and the morning, I hoped, would find us at Abu Markha. But I heard rumours of a visit to Nijl.   Now Nijl was some six
miles out of our way and meant deliberately turning off the direct road to Abu Markha. Further, there seemed to be no legitimate reason for going there. But my efforts to get the Sherif to let my party continue its way direct were of no use, and I had to follow to Nijl, a detour that meant twelve hours&apos; further delay in Sherif Abdullah getting valuable stores that he was urgently in need of.At Nijl I again asked Sherif Sultan to let my complete party continue to Abu Markha after an hour&apos;s rest, but he refused and said we should leave with the whole caravan at noon, which I knew was untrue, because he had no intention of leaving before the evening. Evening came, and the Sherif said he had decided to stay at Nijl that night ; so I replied that I had not, and he finally agreed for my party and its baggage to proceed alone.This is not the first trip of the same kind I have had. In fact) I have only had one really satisfactory trip (with Sherif Abdullah ibn Hamza). One has to submit to a load of indignities, and the waste of time that occurs in every business detail is appalling, even to one educated in the Orientabs love of procrastination.I thought afterwards that it was queer that Sherif Sultan cared to have an impartial observer present with his caravan to witness the systematic robbing of convoys by the camel men during the journey. Such robbery is not peculiar to this,particular caravan, but always goes on. Bags of rice, flour, barley, etc., are opened en route, a quantity of the contents are extracted, and they are then sewn, up again.Transport is one of the great difficulties in war work here. Not for lack of animals, but rather because the personnel is of so poor a quality7. There are plenty of camels, but they are seldom properly loaded and never employed systematically.The Hejazi will ever be indolent, I suppose.   In his innerheart he is not keen on doing anything that might tend to shorten his revolt. He is fed well, and in most cases scandalously over-paid, a new experience for him ; there is always a shower of backsheesh ready to fall on the slightest provocation, and so he says, May the war- continue for ever !
LYBIA.Arrest of Turks by Idris el-Senussi.About the middle of June, Idris left E/zint. whither he had gone from Akrama (near Tobruk) at the conclusion of the negotiations with Col. Talbot and the Italians. He went west to Geclabia in response to a request from one of his officers, who informed him of a hostile Turkish force in that region. Since that time various rumours and reports have reached us about these Turks, and the native press the other day published an extraordinary story about an Arab revolt from the Turks in Barca (west Cyrenaica). The following letter, dated J ul)&apos; 19, 1917, from Idris to Sherif el-Idrisi (his Cairo representative ancl close personal friend, who was present throughout the recent Tobruk negotia-tions), gives for the first time what may fairly be considered the correct story about these Turks, and it may be inferred that Idris lias kept loyally to his agreement with us and, by means of an. essentially Beduin ruse, has succeeded in clearing Gedabia of the enemy in its midst.The origin, of this Turkish force in Geclabia is. obscure, but it is highly probable that they came over by submarine from Misurata ancl were sent by Nuri and Ramadan Sewehli as an energetic form of remonstrance with Idris for his &quot;perfidy&quot; in making peace with the infidels. Musa Pasha el-Yemeni, the C.G. of the force, is an exceptionally able man ancl did fine work for the Turks at Zuara during the Turco-Italian&apos;war. Apparently, Idris either has not been able or has not deemed it politic to arrest Musa Pasha himself.Translation of Letter from Mohammed Idris el-Senussi to Saved Mohammed el-Sherif Abd el- Al-el-Idrisi&apos;.&quot;80 Ramadan, 1835 (July 19, 1917).&quot; Compliments. We have settled the question of the Turks, and the following are the details :  &quot; We ordered those who wanted to go to Nuri to travel at once, and five officers and seven men started. We then gave word to our patrol parties to arrest them should they reach them. They started on the 10th of Ramadan.&quot; On the 20th of Ramadan, we sent away fifty of them, including sixteen officers, and also gave word to our patrol parties to arrest them.&quot;On the 27th of Ramadan, I gave Musa Pasha a definite order to the effect that all those who were at &quot; El Kasr &quot; should leave that very day, either willingly, or by force, ancl go to their Pasha, Nuri. He begged that they should be allowed to remain until the feast was over, but I. told him that, if at sunset they were still inside &quot; El Kasr.&quot; I would destroy it on their heads with
guns, and that they should leave in six hours after receiving my order. So they left, much against their will, and stopped at a place about one hour distant to the west of the town. At seven o&apos;clock on the evening of 28th Ramadan, we ordered our troops, whom we had kept ready at Shedalat, to follow them. At twenty minutes before dawn, our troops with their guns and machine guns succeeded in completely surrounding them. They were still sleeping and so, one by one, we captured them all and took all the arms and ammunition and Russian machine guns which they had. They counted eighty-seven, and ares till at El-Akta&apos;in, about seven hours to the south of Jeddabia. We hope to have them transferred on the 2nd Shawal to EI-Kafra, as well as all others whom we found suspicious.&quot;Just now we heard that all those who had gone across the fire line, or through the zone of our patrol parties, have also been captured and will be sent over in two days. We have sent orders to our patrol parties to capture Jemal Bey in Daur el-Abyar, Abdel Kader el-lSTajcli in Gerdis, and Abdel Rahman el-Yemeni in Khawlan, and the four Syrian gunners who are with him, as well as Goma. Effendi and Rajah Effendi who are with the Bara&apos;sa. We shall send them to join their companions at Kafra. Up till now the number of those captured is 149, including forty-one officers, apart from those whom we are going to capture soon.&quot; Salaams to Saved Morghani and to all the Saveds and Ashraf.&quot;NOTES.Indians at Elodeidali.It is reported from Kamaran that a Seyyid named Abdel Kader, of Marawa (a few miles north-east of Hocleidah), approached the Turks with a view to the removal of the British Indian merchants from Hocleidah to Marawa, promising to pay  1,000 and guaranteeing their safe custod)&apos;. The Vali of the Yemen declined the offer, though he is said to have enquired whether the Seyyid would pay  2,000. He stated that the Arabs would release the merchants against a ransom from the enemy, but added that the merchants held a considerable amount of property and money, both at Hodeidah and in the interior, which the Turkish Govern-ment hoped to secure so as to-relieve the financial stress in the vilayet. It is reported at the same time that the merchants are in., secret correspondence with the secretary of the Imam and the Zeidi Kadi at Sanaa with a Anew to their release.11 adhramaut.Aden reports that, according to the statements of pilgrims, hostilities are expected between the Kaiti and the Kathiri. The latter have been in correspondence with AH Said Pasha, who, it is said, intends to send them arms and ammunition (see p. 245).
However this may be, the Kaiti Sultan undoubtedly intends to attack the Kathiri Sultan, who refuses to recognize his suzerainty, and Kathiri troops are reported at Shibain and AI Kutn, which are close to the Kathiri country. The Sultan is sending his Wazir to report to the Resident at Aden. It appears that he could put considerable pressure on the Kathiri by preventing goods from going up country from Mokalla and Sheher, the only outlets which the Kathiri have to the sea ; but he has not as yet applied this method of persuasion.News received from Mokalla since the above was written shows that the Kaiti Sultan has now decided to stop all caravans for the Kathiri country. He is also reported to have arranged a truce with, and given money to, his traditional enemies the Hanuuni, who have hitherto been allied with the Kathiri.Yemen News.The Idrisi has entered into agreements, with a view to active operations against the Turks in Yemen, with certain sections of the Hashid and Bekil, at least 1,500 of whom are now at Jeizan. The most important Sheikhs among the latter are Masucl el-Barak and Salih ibn Maid el-Moghrabi of the Dhu Udhrah section of the Hashid, and Abdullah ibn Ghazeilan and Yahya ibn Yahya el-Shaif of the Dhu Mohammed section of the Bekil. Nasir Mabkhut is said to be on his way to join the Idrisi, who has also established amicable relations with three Sherifs of Kaukeban, probably of the Imamic house of Sharaf el-Din, and several other influential persons in the Yemen, including Abdullah, the brother of the Imands chief general, Serf el-Islam Mohammed ibn el-Mutawakkil Mohsen. Idrisi is now said to have 3,000 men, in addition to his own forces from Asir, and he proposes to raise an army of 10,000 men, mainly of the Hashid and Bekil, with which he will clear the Tehama and hold the passes into the hills to prevent a flanking movement by the Turks or Imam. He further proposes that if the present Imam abstains from assisting the Turks, and will come to terms with the British Government after the conclusion of hostilities, he shall be left undisturbed ; but that otherwise he shall be deposed and his lands given to a new Imam appointed by the tribes. His programme, therefore, is not identical with that of the Con-fecleracy as hitherto reported, and his relations with it are somewhat obscure.He has sent a message to Aden that he wishes, in the event of his success, that we should appoint a ruler of the Tehama, as he has no desire to rule there. It will be remembered that last December he claimed the whole of the Tehama down to Mokha (Bulletin No. 37, p. 7), and it may be doubted wdiether.be has reallv abandoned this claim.
In considering the Idrisi&apos;s plans, it may be interesting to note the distribution and approximate numbers of the Turkish troops in Yemen.   These are estimated as follows : On Idrisi&apos;s southern boundary : 1,440 men, with twenty-two guns and one machine gun.In the Tehama : 600 men, six or eight guns and one machine gun.In the northern and central highlands : 550 men and some guns.At Mawia and Taiz; : 500 men, six to eight guns and two or three machine guns.In front of Aden : 2,075 men (including 350 Arabs), about thirty-five guns and four machine guns.Moza district and Sheikh Said : 250 men and eleven guns.In view of the insignificance of the Turkish garrisons in the highlands, the idrisis anticipation of a flanking attack suggests that he contemplates hostilities with the Imam as well as with the Turks.According to an estimate of his resources winch has been forwarded from Aden, his Customs&apos;, revenue up to last May amounted to over $50,000 per month. Imports having recently-decreased, he has apparently made up for the consequent loss by imposing a, tax of $5 on every camel load leaving Jeizan for the interior. From the salt works at Jeizan he receives an income of about $20,000 per month, and ho- collects tithes, etc., from other parts of his territory. His Wazir, Mohammed Basahi, makes large profits by buying dollars in Asir and selling them at a much higher rate in Aden, die export of dollars hj any other persons being prohibited. Idrisi does not pay his soldiers on active service, but only provides them with rations. Though nominally every able-bodied men in the Jeizan territory is liable for military service, he cannot in reality raise even 20^ of the population without the risk of provoking a rebellion, for his subjects, many of whom are engaged in business, dislike fighting except in defence of their own homes.The disturbances resulting from the execution of Abu Ras show no signs of abating. Risings arc reported from several districts. The Zeidi tribes are threatening Kataba, Mawia. and Jebel Jihaf. [lias Bey, the Commandant of Taiz, has been held up since June 22 at the village of El-Kaida, and All Said Pasha is believed to be unwilling to release any of his troops at Lahej to send relief to the besieged Commandant.At the meeting between the Imam and the Zeidi chiefs, reported on page 355, the latter are said to have declared that nothing would satisfy them but the beheading of Nasir Muqbil and his Turkish supporters. As the head of Abu Ras was hung for three days at the gate of Mawia by Nasir Muqbil, and as
hundreds of their tribesmen bad been killed and wounded in the recent fighting by Nasir MuqbiTs men, it would be a lasting-disgrace to the tribes if adequate revenge were not taken. It is reported that the 4,000 men of the Dhu Mohammed and Dhu Hussein who, after the meeting, joined forces with Kaid ibn Hassan (see p. 355) had a successful but severe engagement with Nasir MuqbiPs force near Gebel al Kaclama.Another unconfirmed report has reached Aden of a fight between the followers of Sheikh Mohammed Hassan of Gebel ilabashi, north of Taiz, and a Turkish force advancing to enforce a demand upon, him for $40,000 as arrears of taxes and a war contribution. Forty of the Turks are said to have been killed. The Sheikh is the head of a religious fraternity at Taiz, and Avas formerly known as an ardent pro-Turk, but was attacked in 1915 by Ahmed Naaman, Kaimmakam of Hajarieh, for refusal to pay tithe.It is now reported from Aden, that the Imam&apos;s Commander Abu Naib, who was mentioned in the last Bulletin, as marching on Mawia, has left Rahida with his men and will probably pass through Ibb ancl Dhamar on his way back to the Imam.
