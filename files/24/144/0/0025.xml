On the 2nd January Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 15] the following translation of the German reply to the Russian peace offer : Clause 1. Russia and Germany announce that at the end of the war both countries will live in peace and friendship hereafter. As soon as peace is declared, and the Russian army has been demobilized, Germany and her allies will retire from then-present positions and from all Russian territory occupied by them so far as this corresponds to clause 2.Clause 2. The Russian Government having, in accordance with its principles, agreed to the autonomy of all its peoples, noting the decision of Poland, Livonia, Courland, and parts of Esthonia and Lithuania in this direction, and their desire to separate from Russia, accepts their decision as the expression of the will of these peoples. As the above territory cannot be evacuated in accordance with Clause 1, dates and means will be arranged for confirming the autonomy by voting without military interference on the part of Russia or of Germany; a special commission will consider this question.Clause 3. Treaties, agreements, &amp;c, concluded between both parties before the war shall be reinstated so far as this corresponds with changes which have occurred during the war in the possessions of both countries. Within three months of the signing of peace, Germany and Russia take upon themselves the obligation to inform each other of those treaties, agreements, &amp;c, or extracts therefrom not liable to repeal under Clause 1. Where extracts are put forth the other party can within one month decline to recognise the treaty. Any individual points of treaties which are cancelled must be replaced at the earliest possible moment by others in accordance with the new position.Clause 4.

Clause 5. The contracting parties agree that upon the conclusion of peace war/ from the economic standpoint shall be also terminated. They will mutually not participate in any measures having the object to continue hostile acts on economic grounds directly or indirectly, and will by all means in their power hinder such measures within their countries even coming from private or other quarters. Conversely they will remove all difficulties which hinder the renewal of friendly trade and business relations and will facilitate exchange of goods between both countries, especially for equalisation of superfluities and shortages. During the transition period which is necessary to overcome the consequences of war and the new regulation of relationship, they will permit limitation of relations such as prohibition of exports, regulation of imports, &amp;e. when unavoidable during this period, within limits Celt by both parties as little burdensome as possible. During this time, however, they will impede the acquisition of necessary articles as little as possible by import duties and will therefore as soon as possible enter into negotiations to maintain as long as possible those releases from payment of duties which were established during the war and still longer maintain them in force and extend them wider. At the same time they will organise as far as possible during this period the exchange of goods. For this purpose joint committees will be formed which should start work as speedily as possible.Clause 6. The contracting parties will as speedily as possible begin negotiations for concluding a commercial and navigation treaty, the stipulations of which shall corre-spond with the new circumstances, in place of the commercial and navigation treaty of 1894-1904, which will not again come into force.Clause 7. Regardless of the conclusion of the new treaty of commerce and naviga-tion, the contracting parties will grant each other the most-favoured-nation rights in the qtiestiou of trade and navigation during at least twenty years; neither party, however, will lay claim to participate in the favourable treatment which may have taken place at any time in small frontier relationships, or which Russia may grant to Asiatic countries on her borders, or independent states formed out of the Russian empire, or which Germany may grant Austria-Hungary or other allied countries associated with her at the present time or in the future by customs union or to her colonies.Clause 8. Russia consents that the European Danube Commission be permanently entrusted with the control of all mouths of the Danube, and that this Commission be composed only from states bordering the Danube and Black Sea, while the control of the Danube above Braila shall be entrusted to the states bordering this portion of the river.Clause 9. The laws of war limiting the private rights of Germans in Russia and Russians in Germany as subjects of mutually belligerent countries shall be annulled.

Each negotiating party reimburses the damages caused in its own territory during&apos; the warns the result of acts of violence in contradiction to international law as far as civilians (especially diplomatic and consular officers of the opposite side) are concerned, for damages such as life, health, property, embassies and consular property and buildings.

Diplomatic and consular relations between the negotiating parties shall be renewed as soon as possible.Peace at any Price. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 6th January [No. 52] that it appeared that M. Trotsky had decided to come to terms with the enemy.On the same day he transmitted [No. 47] a telegram from the military attache, who said that it appeared from a conversation he had had with a Russian delegate lately returned from Brest that a separate peace, at any price, was considered necessary by the Bolsheviks, who would sign it to retain power. An effort would be made to get the negotiations transferred to Copenhagen.On the 7th January Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 59] that, though it was rumoured that M. Trotsky intended to conclude a separate peace, according to the general staff his idea is to prolong negotiations as long as possible to enable a volunteer army to assemble.The Aims of the Bolsheviks. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 7th January [No. 58]&apos;that the Bolshevik movement was completely in the hands of MM. Trotsky and Lenin, and they had fully explained their aims and policy, winch might be summed up as social revolution throughout the world, with the entire suppression of nationality, property, and religion. They were only interested in questions of war and peace in so far as the object of the revolution was thereby affected,-and the cause of small nationalities had only been espoused by M. Trotsky for tactical reasons. At present M. Trotsky was on the horns of a dilemma ; if the refused he German terms be would lose his influence, with the Russian masses, whose only desire was peace, whilst on the other hand if he accepted them he would lose his influence in the west, where he hoped to bring about revolution. In any case both he and M. Lenin would do all they could to discredit till existing Governments aud prevent either of the belligerent sides scoring a success. They were particularly hostile to everything British and would do what they could to upset our rule in Egypt and India.Sir George Buchanan. The following telegram was sent to Sir George Buchanan by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the 4th January : -I am very sorry to learn that your health is still so unsatisfactory.The War Cabinet desire me to express to you their warmest thanks for all the eminent services you have rendered to your country. They hope that by a much needed rest your health may soon be restored, and that you may long be spared to continue your career of public usefulness.May I be permitted to add my own cordial acknowledgment for all you&apos; have done for us? If I may be permitted to say so, your courage, resource, and character have been an inspiration to us all, and you have worthily upheld the great tradition and ideals of your country.Bolshevik Representative in London. Sir G. Buchanan, telegraphed on the 4th January that the following decree had been published in the official organ of the Soviet Government : &quot;In the name of Soviets of Workmen, Soldieis, and Peasants&apos; Deputies-Citizen Litvinoff is hereby appointed provisional plenipotentiary in London by the People&apos;s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs. All members of the embassy, the military mission in general, all officials of the Russian Republic actually residing in Great Britain engaged on official duties are invited at the first demand of Citizen Litvinoff to. hand over to him all current affairs, documents, and public moneys of the Russian Republic which may be at their disposal.&quot; Any opposition to the orders of Litvinoff given in the above-indicated sense will be dealt with as a crime against the State.&quot; (Signed) Trotsky.&quot;An identically worded document was also published appointing Citizen Karpinsky provisional pie lipotentiaiw in Geneva.1898-77] &apos; B 2
The Ukraine.Recognition of de facto Government. Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 1 0 j ou the 8th January to Mr. Bagge at Odessa informing him that it had been decider! by the French and British Governments to recognise the do facto Government of the Ukraine, and that he was to act as the British representative at Kieff.The Rada and the Soviet. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed ou the 3rd January [No. 21] that the papers had reported that the Ukraine Government bad addressed an enquiry to the Soviet Government as to whether the latter considered itself at war with the Ukraine ; if not, the Bada demanded the immediate recall of ali Bolshevik troops actually within or on their way to the Ukraine, and free permission for all Ukrainians on the Bussian front to return home at once. An official communique dated the 2nd January had been published stating that the Soviet Government had offered to open negotiations either at Smolensk or Vitebsk with a view to avoiding war, provided that the Bada would officially recognise the counter-revolutionary character of General Kaledine&apos;s activities and would not impede military operations against him.FINLAND.Recogition of Independence. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 3rd January j No. 20! that the Commissaries of the People had agreed to the proposition of the Committee of Soviets that independence should be granted to Finland.Lord Bertie telegraphed on the 5th January [No. 31 j that the &quot; Temps &quot; had announced that the French Government had recognised the independence of the Finnish Republic; and on the same day Sir E. Howard telegraphed [No. 42] that the Swedish Government had also decided to recognise it.RUSSIA IN ASIA.The Caucasus.General Situation. -Mr. Stevens telegraphed from Tiflis on the 5th January [No. 6] that during the past few days the general situation had become alarming in South Caucasus. Collisions, with much loss of life, were taking place between Russian soldiers returning from the front and Moslem troops, tribesmen, and Persian brigands. A. brigade of mixed nationalities was being formed at Tiflis with a view to the pacification of disturbing elements in the affected districts. It was said that Turkish military agents were agitating in various places, trying to incite a general massacre of Armenians. The news from Urumia was very disquieting. The catholic Chaldean bishop and the orthodox bishop had come to Tiflis to appeal for protection ; they described the situation as a very grave, one. According to them Persian bandits and Turkish Kurds were combining with the object of assassinating the whole Christian population directly the Russian troops were withdrawn. This massacre, they said, could only be averted either by the presence of a strong military force or by the capture of Mosul.Siberia.Irkutsk in the hands of the Bolsheviks. On the 7th January Sir J. Jordan transmitted [No. 24] a telegram from Harbin saying that news had been received by the Japanese consul-general to the effect that the Bolsheviks had been in possession of Irkutsk since the 2nd January; there was no organisation for the maintenance of order, the commander of the military district and all other officers having been dismissed.Turkestan.Reported Formation of a Government. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 4th January [No. 34] that it was reported from Turkestan that a Government had been formed at Samarcand; and on the following day Mr. Balfour telegraphed to the consul-general at Meshed inquiring into the truth of the report.ARABIA.Hejaz.Our Aims in regard to Syria. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed [No. 141.8] on the 31st December saying that he thought it necessary that some communication should be made to King Plnssein in regard to our ultimate line in regard to Syria
as he would certainly make inquiries in regard to it when he saw Commander Hogarth.Mr. Balfour telegraphed on. the 4th January [No. 24] that it would be best to reply as follows : (i.) That so far as Palestine was concerned the Entente Powers were determined that no people should be subjected to another ;. but. in view of the fact that there were shrines, wakfs, and holy places, sacred in some cases to Christians alone, to Moslems alone, to Jews alone, and in others to two or to ail three of these, and as these places were of interest to vast masses of people outside Palestine and Arabia, there must be a special regime approved of by the world to deal with them. As regarded the mosque of Omar it would be considered as a Moslem concern alone and would not be subjected, directly or indirectly, to any non-Moslem authority.(ii.) The Entente Powers were determined that the Arab race should be given full opportunity of once again forming a nation in the world ; but this could only be achieved by the Arabs themselves uniting, and Great Britain and her allies would, pursue a policy with this ultimate unity in view.(in.) Since Jewish opinion was in favour of a return of Jews to Palestine and His Majesty&apos;s Government viewed wiih favour the realisation of this aspiration, it was determined that in so far as should be compatible with the economic and political freedom of the existing population no obstacle should be put in the way of the realisation of this ideal. In regard to this matter it should be pointed out to the King that the leaders of the movement were determined to bring about the success of Zionism by friendship and co-operation with the Arabs, and that the friendship of Jewry to the Arab cause was equivalent to support in all States where Jews had a political influence.Nejd.Letter from Ibn Saud. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 4th January [No. 30] that a letter to him from Ibn Saud had been brought to Jeddah by Mr. Philby and a summary of the contents had been telegraphed to him. Ibn Saud sent his congratidations on the recent victories and asked for letters and all news. He had long desired to communicate directly with Sir R. Wingate. He hoped that the Jeddah meeting would provide an opportunity for a profitable discussion of matters concerning Great Britain and the Arab nation. Pie would then take the necessary measures against Ibn Rashid and the Turks.PERSIA.Russian Troops in Persia. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 5th January [No. 41 j from Petrograd that the official organ of the Soviet Government had published the&apos; correspondence which had passed between M. Trotsky and the Persian Government respecting the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Persia in accordance with the provisions of article 12 of the Brest agreement of the &apos;15th December last, concluded between Russia, Germany, Austria, Turkey, and Bulgaria.The Persian Government through its minister at Petrograd had expressed its readiness to commence negotiations immediately iu regard to this matter and had instructed its minister at Constantinople to arrange for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Persia.M. Trotsky therefore proposed : 1. The immediate drawing up of a common plan of evacuation of Russian and turkish troops from Persia. 2. The immediate withdrawal of those units which were quartered in localities ofnon-military importance, which were merely holding the occupied portionof Persian territory.3. The recall from Persia of the Russian military mission sent as instructors of the Cossack Brigade.4. The immediate appointment by the Russian Government of commissioners in Persia to acquaint the people with the new policy and the general political situation in Russia, and to secure the safety of the people against the violence of the less enlightened elements of the army.-5. The immediate adoption of measures to ensure the proper provisioning of the Russian army in Persia until its withdrawal in such manner as would be least burdensome to the poorer masses of the Persian people.
In conclusion M. Trotsky begged to be informed as speedily as possible in regard to the practical steps which the Persian Government intended to take in the above sense is necessary for the liquidation, as speedily as possible, of the past oppressive policy of Russia towards Persia.&quot;itLA TEST INTELLIGENCE,FINLAND.Recognition of Independence by Germany. Mr. Lindley telegraphed from Petrograd on the 8th January [No. 61] that a Finnish newspaper had announced the recognition by Germany of the independence of Finland.EGYPT.The Arab Committee. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 7th January TNo. 46] that he had received a letter from the Arab Committee in Cairo, thanking him for transmitting one from Sir Mark Sykes, which enabled them to realise that the liberation of &quot; Syria, Armenia, and the remainder of the Arab provinces &quot; was the main consideration. They noted, too, with pleasure that the Zionists desired merely to have the right of settling in Palestine and there living their own national life. They under-took to acton SirR. Wingate&apos;s advice and endeavour to attain full agreement with the Armenians and the Zionists.PERSIA.A New Cabinet to be formed. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 8th January [No. 14] that he had received a visit from Motamin-ul-Mulk, who had called on behalf of Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek, who had been charged with the formation of a Cabinet. The object of his visit was to submit formulas of declarations to be made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government as soon, as Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek had assumed office. Motamin-ul-Mulk said that he believed a friendly Cabinet could be formed if such declarations were assured, that he thought that there would be no difficulty in their giving assurances which would satisfy us. As the assurances asked for did not appear to be in excess of those already agreed to by His Majesty Js Government, Sir C. Marling thought it would be well worth while to come to terms. Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek and Motamin-ul-Mulk, though not ideal, were leaders of the moderate democrats, and it would be a great step to have them on our side.The assurances asked for are as follows : (1) The settlement of the question of the South Persian Rifles shall form the subject of pourparlers between the two Governments, with the object of reaching a decision in conformity with the principle of absolute neutrality, such that the forces requisite for the maintenance of order and security shall form (? a single) uniform corps for the whole country, which corps shall be organized by European officers, the choice of whom will be made by common consent. (2) Agreement in principle, with a revision of the tariffs of 1902. (3) The presence of Persian representatives at a peace conference if other non-belligerents are admitted generally.PKIKTED AT the foreign office  15v   c.  u.  harrison.-12/1/1918.
