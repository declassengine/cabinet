secret.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN   REPORT No. XLVII.Russia.THE Russian situation is more obscure than ever, and will remain so until jmething more like a decision has been reached between the Bolsheviks and the Ikraine. Upon the latter the Cossack and Caucasus position must largely depend, eographically, politically, and economic. The Bolshevik forces include the crews of sets, and in the Black Sea this fact is serious.Trotsky is evidently a genuine Karl Marxian Jewish Internationalist, who is seking to spread this new anti-national dispensation. It is therefore difficult to see sow he can possibly arrive at any solid basis of permanent settlement with von kuhlmann ndCzernin the representatives of Kaiserism. It is therefore a cpiestion whether rotsky really represents the present characteristics of Russian Bolshevism, which contain enuine pro-German elements. The Jewish Bund alone of Jewish organisations in lussia shares Trotsky&apos;s views, the majority of Russian Jews being more than ever trongly nationalist, and now potentially an asset of the Entente.Palestine.The absence of a telegram of congratulation on the capture of Jerusalem from the bug of the Hejaz is perhaps an indication of concern, if not coolness, among the Arabs esulting from what may appear to them an over-championship of non-Moslem, articularly Jewish, interests. This can best be set right by successful military action asfc of the Jordan, accompanied by full recognition both by us, and by the non-Moslem aterests concerned, of Arab achievements and interests, which are, identic with those of he allied cause.W. 0.

A text of the armistice agreement, compiled from texts sent out from Petrograd and Berlin (neither of which was complete), was published in the &quot; Times &quot; of the 19th December. Putving aside the usual technical articles, the most important provisions are as follows: (1) The armistice will remain in force until noon on the 14th January, but on the 21st day of the armistice (7th January) the contracting parties have the right to give seven days&apos; notice to determine it; if this be not done it will remain in force until one party gives such seven days&apos; notice. (2) The contracting parties undertake that until the 14th January they will not put into operation any transfer of troops from the front between the Black Sea and the Baltic, excepting such transfers as had been begun before the signing of the armistice agreement. (3) On every sector of a Russian divismn, organised intercourse may take place at from two to three points. For this purpose centres for intercourse on divisional fronts are to be established between the lines of demarcation, and are to be distinguished by white flags. Intercourse is to be allowed between sunrise and sunset, and not more than twenty-five persons (unarmed) may be present from each side at the same time. The exchange of news and newspapers is to be permitted. (4) Taking their stand upon the f eedom and independence and territorial inviolability of the neutral portion of the Persian Empire, the Turkish and Russian high commands will immediately enter into communication with the Persian Government with a view to the withdrawal of their forces from Persia. (5) The contracting parties agree to begin negotiations for peace immediately.Sir W. Townley, telegraphing from The Hague on the 18th December [No. 4263]. said that the Vienna &quot; Con espondenz Bureau&quot; had wired that the Governments of Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, and Turkey would now speedily open negotiations for peace with Russia : the delegates were being selected and, pending their arrival at the German headquarters, the representatives of those Governments who had concluded the armistice were conducting non-committal negotiations.The Government and the Constituent Assembly. On the 13th and 14th December Sir G. Buchanan transmitted [Nos. 2018 and 2027] telegrams from the military attache saying that the Cadet party had been declared by the Government to be (? enemies of [898 74] &apos; &quot; B
ths people), had ordered the arrest of its leaders, and had already arrested six of them who had arrived in Petrograd as elected members of the Constituent Assembly. The Cadet party would occupy the third place in the election, and the block between it and that of the Right Social Revolutionaries would have a majority in the Constituent Assembly, to terrorise which was, of course, Lenin&apos;s object. Whilst the Cadets were arrested, the Bolshevik members on their arrival in the capital were told to return home and await instructions ; by which means Lenin will avoid the necessity of opening the Assembly, which he promised to do when there was a quorum of (? 400) members.The Bolshevists and anti-British Moslem feeling. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 2043] on the 16th December that an anti-British feeling among Russian Moslems had been going on for some time and was a serious menace, and now the Bolshevists were doing all they could to stir up Moslem feeling against us, and this propaganda had been helped by the statement that Palestine was to be turned into a Jewish State, as the Moslems claimed 800,000 inhabitants out of a total of 1,000,000.Detention &apos;of British Subjects in Russia [see Eastern Report XLV, p. 3, and XLVI, p. 5]. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 13th December [No. 2020] that Captain Smith had informed M. Trotsky as to the substance of Mr. Balfour&apos;s telegram of the 10th December. M. Trotsky was pleased, and issued instructions for the removal of the embargo on British subjects.The Refusal to admit British Messengers. In the same telegram [No. 2020] Sir G. Buchanan said that M. Trotsky did not remove the embargo on the visits of Xing&apos;s messengers ; he said that he should be compelled to stop them so long as the diplomatic visa was refused to Bolshevik messengers. M. Trotsky argued that he had an equal right to stop British messengers, as Sir G. Buchanan was accredited to a non-existent Government by one which did not recognise the Bolsheviks, so that technically he was nothing more than a private individual. In the end, however, he agreed to allow Mr. Wilton to leave and the messenger en route to enter Russia, after which he would discuss the question in a friendly spirit. Sir G. Buchanan was of opinion that this should be done on the basis of M. Trotsky giving an assurance that his messengers should only go to England in that capacity, and not as socialist or pacificist propagandists.The Ukraine.Fighting between Bolsheviks and Ukraine Troops. The British Consul at Odessa telegraphed on the 15th December [No. 165] that, principally on account of the refusal of the Rada to permit passage through its territory of any Bolshevik reinforcements against the Cossacks, there bad been street fighting on the 14th December and some casualties.   The British colony was all safe and the town was then quiet.ROUMANIA.The Armistice. Sir G. Barclay transmitted [No. 766] a message from the military attache on the 11th December (received the 16th December) saying that an armistice had been arranged on the 9th December; by giving 72 hours&apos; notice either party could resume hostilities, otherwise the armistice was for an indefinite period.ABYSSINIA.The German Minister.-Mx. Campbell telegraphed [No. 72] from Adis Abeba on the 11th December that the Empress had given the German Minister a personal assurance that she did not wish him to leave the country, and further that money would be advanced by her Government for his maintenance. Telegraphing again [No. 73] on the following day, he said that Count Colli was utterly opposed to the expulsion of the Germans.The Arms Question. Mr. Campbell, telegraphing on the 1 2th December, said that, on the grounds that Ras was stronger than when he made the request for arms and that a grant of rifles would imply the open support of him as against the Empress, Count Colli was asking his Government to refuse such a grant, and further that, pending the decision as to the arms traffic, no arms whatever should be given to any Abyssinian.
ARMENIA.Demand for a Declaration as to the future of Armenia. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 14th December [No. 2022] that he had received a report from the representative of the Anglo-Russian Commission at Tiflis to the effect that the Armenians were not satisfied with the generalities which had been hitherto pronounced on the subject of Armenia, and wished to know whether they were to be autonomous, to have Home Rule, to be annexed or protected by Russia, or what. They were most anxious that some definite statement should be published indicating what the Allies were prepared to do after the war. Sir G Buchanan said that he realised the difficulty of making such a statement, but he thought it would be well for some sympathetic statement to be made in Parliament.PERSIA.The Shah and his Policy. Sir C. Marling telegraphed [No. 433] on the 9th December, saying that the Shah requested assurances of his safety, of a pension, and a guarantee of the possession of his estates in the event of what he calls &quot; a coup d&apos;etat,&quot; failing and costing him his throne. The &quot;coup d&apos;e&quot;tat&quot; in question is the appointment of Vossuk-ed-Dowleh as Prime Minister with carte blanche to deal with the situation. Vossuk-ed-Dowleh told Sir C. Ai aiding that, though he was ready to accept office in some capacity, he thought that Sipahsalar should be Premier, as his greater prestige and more imperious temper fitted him better to dead summarily with opposition. Provided that we support it, Sir C. Marling said that a Vossuk-ed-Dowleb combination, within the next few days, seemed to be certain, as Ain-ed-Dowleh&apos;s Cabinet was practically dissolved, four of his colleagues having resigned. Vossuk-ed-Dowleh seemed to be satisfied with the measures of support contemplated [Eastern Report XLVI, p. 3] and the annexed conditions.As to these conditions, Sir C. Marling understood that the Shah would be satisfied with an assurance that we would do all that wras possible to secure his safety, and he thought that it would be worth while promising him a pension on condition that he did not abdicate except under force majeure, that our guarantee was for the period of the war only, and that he did his best now and in the future to secure a Cabinet pledged to a policy of friendly neutrality.Vossuked-DovdeKs Proposals. Sir C. Marling telegraphed [No. 446] on the 16th December that Vossuk-ed-Dowleh proposed (with the general approval of the Shah) that assurances should be given to him, now privately and later, after he has formed his Cabinet and got to work, in general terms that there should be a monthly subvention or advance, another monthly allowance for the payment of the Cossack division, a credit for possible military operations against rebels, arms or money to purchase them in Persia, the whole amounting to a couple of million tomans down, and monthly payments or advances of some 375,000 tomans. He further asked for the cancellation of the 1907 convention and kindred agreements; genuine assistance and support (? a campaign) for the regeneration of Persia; the substitution (at the end of the war) of a uniform force under neutral officers for the South Persian Rifles ; and the repre-sentation of Persia in the international conference (also at the end of the war) in which other non-belligerents would take part. In return he undertook to govern Persia with a strong hand, to crush the democrats ruthlessly, and, in the closest co-operation with ourselves, to inaugurate reforms, in all of which Nosret-ed-Dowleh and Kavam-us-Sultaneh would work with him.Sir C. Marling did not think that Vossuk-ed-Dowleh and his friends could carry out their programme, but the second set of proposals given above showed what value he set on assurances which would enable him to run a reform party by exonerating him from a charge of subserviency to us ; and in his opinion our position would not be hurt by granting these demands. Vossuk himself would like to hear that they were not acceptable, as he would rather let Sipahsalar clear the ground, and then come forward to help in the task of construction. Provided the Shah was squared and financial help given, one or the other could be brought into office, and then later, by Government assurances of our general policy wTe could greatly strengthen the position of his Cabinet. A general declaration of policy seemed imperative, and in any case it could only do good.[898-74] B 8
On the following day he telegraphed again [No. 447], urging that it was of primary importance that no time should be lost to bring in a Vossuk-ed-Dowleh or Sipahsalar cabinet; and also to pin down the Shah, who might very well throw himself into the arms of the democrats out of sheer terror caused by the assassination on the previous night of the head of the detective police service, a crime which was unquestionably the work of a new committee of punishment. In that event he might appoint an extremist cabinet, in which Mukhber-es-Sultaneh would be the leading spirit, and then a very dangerous situation might easily arise.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.BUSSIA.Peace Negotiations. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 18th December [No. 2057] that according to the press peace negotiations were to begin that day at Brest. Bussia would be represented by Professor Pokrovski, of the university of Moscow, and the enemy Powers hy Kiihhnann and Count Czernin. M. Trotsky&apos;s instructions were to ask first if the enemy accepted the principle of peace without annexations and contributions, and to this he expected an affirmative reply. The Bussiau delegate would then ask what about the Poles of Posen and Galicia, and the Little Russians of Galicia. There would be then an interval of from seven or ten days, the Russians returning to consult at Petrograd.The Question of the Messengers. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan on the 19th December [No. 2502] saying that he had decided, after careful consideration, not to oppose the granting of visas to Russian diplomatic couriers. Such couriers would be expected to leave this country by the first available opportunity and whilst here would be restrained from any activities unconnected with their duties as messengers. We should be obliged to accept the Bolshevist visa at Petrograd and at Stockholm.Arrest of the Committee of the Roumanian Front. Sir G. Barclay (on the 16th December) transmitted [No. 781] a message from the military, attache&quot; saying that the committee of the Roumanian front had been arrested by the Bolsheviks, an act which pointed to the growing power of the latter in that region. The committee had been working well with Tcherbatchef in maintaining order.M. Trotsky and the Military Mission at Kieff. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 18th December [No. 2065] that M. Trotsky had that day called at the French Embassy and had informed the Ambassador that the presence of a military mission was out of place at Kieff, as there was likely to be civil war ; but the Ambassador contended that we had a right to leave our officers there, even if there were civil war, as the Ukraine had been recognised by the Government as a separate nationality.ROUMANIA.M. Take Jonesco on the Future of Roumania. Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 19th December [No. 796] that M. Take Jonesco had said in the course of conversation that before long a separate peace would be inevitable for Roumania. Notwithstanding the good-will of the Prime Minister and the present Government, circumstances would be too strong for them, especially the retirement of demoralised Russian troops, who would devastate the country and precipitate the approaching famine. He could no longer remain in the country.ZIONISM.Message from the Salonika Jews. On the (?) 17th December a deputation representing the Jewish community in Salonika (some 80,000 in number) waited upon General Milne, commander-in-chief of the British forces, to beg him to convey to His Majesty the King their thanks for the recent declaration of his Government in regard to Zionism and their congiatulations on the liberation of Jerusalem.
PERSIA.Vossuk-ed-Dowleh. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 19th December saying that he had been informed by Vossuk-ed-Dowleh that he would not work under Sipahsalar, )and that in his opinion the latter would make a mess of things without him (Vossuk-ed-Dowleh) and his brother. Sir C. Marling concurred in thia opinion, and added that Sipahsalar&apos;s appointment would not only be distasteful to the Shah, but would rouse the Bakhtiari. He strongly urged the acceptance of his conditions. Events were moving fast, and if immediate steps were not taken by us to prevent it, a cabinet formed by Mukhber-es-Sultaneh seemed inevitable ; and he had learnt that Mukhber was practically pledged to break off relations with us.neidDOhos-pn Ion-lis&apos;lrdPRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OKFICB BT  C.
