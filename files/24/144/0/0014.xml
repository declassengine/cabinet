SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT, No. XXXIX.134Russia.THE Soviet peace proposals contain one interesting item from an Oriental point of view, inasmuch as Armenian autonomy figures secoud on the list. This concession to Armenia is satisfactory, inasmuch as the Soviet does not, as might be feared, agree to handing back the Armenians to the Turks.Turkey. S- ,The Turkish information should be read with care. The late manager of the Haifa-Damascus Railway may be a Mr. Pilling, who was responsible for a company which failed many years ago to build a railway from Haifa to Damascus. However, it is noticeable that the Turks have some reason of their own for desiring to impress upon the Germans that they are engaged in informal negotiations with us.Tala&apos;at&apos;s speech, given in the latest intelligence, seems to be the answer of the C.TJ.P. in anticipation of the Soviet resolutions on the Armenian question. Tala&apos;at&apos;s reference to Mr. Morgsnthau is of great interest, since it fits in with the fact that Mr. Morgenthau&apos;s coming departure from America was mentioned at a meeting of English Turcophils before anyone in England was aware officially of his intended move.Morocco.   (See p. 4.)The Turkish pan-Islamic activity in North Africa is a serious indication of future trouble.   This note should be compared with last week&apos;s Appendix.Arabia.Sir P. Cox&apos;s telegrams show how widespread and far-reaching are the efforts of the political staff.   An improved military position is helping on the political situation.Appendix I.Russian Turkestan.The information in the Appendix is really the first glimpse we have had of the further Turanian situation. It is valuable, but probably suffers from the following-disadvantages : (a.) The information is very old.(b.) It is probably collated and compiled by officers who are unacquainted with thepurpose of the pan-Turanian scheme, (c.) It is supplied from a centre (Meshed) very distant from the actual scene ofevents.
However, taking these matters all into consideration, the reports tend in some degree to lift the veil from an obscure but important area.The manifest purpose of the pan-Turanian agents of the C.U.P. is to coalesce all Turkish and ,Moslem elements in Russia into one compact force. It may be that the Young Bokharans desire to break down the power of the Amir and the clergy in the first instance, as the C.U.P. did in Turkey, and that, having got control of these elements, they will then proceed to the fuller policy. In any event it is difficult to judge from this first batch of old reports what is really afoot. It is suggested that matter on this head is worth telegraphing in some detail, as it is the only indication we have, and posts are few and slow.Appendix II.This paper shows the Arab movement in a new, unexpected, and satisfactory light.October 26, 1917.M.

The interest to the British public lies in the exposure, unwittingly recorded, of out-Foreign Office and its diplomatic representatives. The Young Turks favoured England. They were anxious to work with England. They looked to us for assistance and guidance. We drove them into the arms of Germany ; we not only drove them, we almost insisted by word of mouth that they should be turned out of our fold. Every turn of the diplomatic steering wheel sent us the wrong way with the Turks. If we had regarded them with sympathy, with consideration, with the eyes of men of the world, the Turks would never have gone into the German camp. There were half a dozen instances in the early days of the crisis when we could have kept Turkey out of the war, or even brought her in on our side. Mr. Einstein tells us now what all well-informed people knew, but it is right that the public should know-from a friend how our interests were served in 1914 and after.In consequence of this Mr. Einstein wrote the following letter, which appeared in the &quot; Daily Express&quot; of Monday, the 22nd October : (To the Editor of the &quot; Daily Express.&quot;)Sir,The leading article in your issue of to-day in which you refer to my diary at Constantinople contains allusions and inferences so foreign to what was in my thought that I must solicit the courtesv of beino; allowed to correct such impression.Nothing could be further from my mind than to expose even &quot;unwittingly&quot; the British Foreign Office and its diplomatic representatives if for no other reason[898-66J B
than that I should have nothing to expose, unless it were to. exhibit the Young Turks as innocent victims whose efforts to obtain English sympathy encountered only rebuffs. Believing as I do that the gang of desperadoes now in power at Constantinople have by their murderous policy against the Armenians committed one of the jmost terrible crimes in history, I should not like to be held responsible for any such view.Lewis Einstein.October 19, 1917.[We fully understand Mr. Einstein&apos;s attitude. Nevertheless his diary proves again that our diplomacy in Turkey was at fault for a long time before the war, and that, while we need not have sympathised with tlie Enver gang, we might at least have outmanoeuvred the German intriguers, and so kept Turkey out of the war.]BUSSIA.Soviet Peace Proposals. Reuter&apos;s agent telegraphed from Petrograd on the 20th October as follows : The Central Executive Committee of the Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Delegates has drawn up the following instructions for its delegate to the Inter-Allied Conference in Paris : I. The evacuation by the German troops of Russia, and the autonomy of Poland,Lithuania, and the&apos; Lettish provinces. 2. The autonomy of Turkish Armenia.3. The solution of the question of Alsace-Lorraine by means of a plebiscite in conditions of absolute liberty, the voting being organised by the local civil administrations after the removal of the troops of the two groups of belligerents. , ,4. The restoration of Belgium in her ancient frontiers and compensation for her losses from an international-fund.5. The restoration of Serbia and Montenegro, with compensation from an inter-national fund. Serbia is to receive access to the Adriatic. Bosnia and Herzegovina are to be autonomous.6. The disputed districts in the Balkans are to receive provisional autonomy, followed by a plebiscite.7. Roumania is to be restored within her old frontiers. She is to give a promise to grant&apos;autonomy to the Dobrudsha, and solemnly to promise to put into immediate execution Article 3 of the Treaty of Berlin, dealing with the equality of rights of Jews.8. Autonomy for the Italian provinces of Austria, followed by a plebiscite.9. The restitution to Germany of all her colonies.10. The re-establishment of Greece and Persia.II. The neutralisation of all straits leading to inner seas, as well as of the Suezand Panama Canals, freedom of navigation for merchant vessels, and theabolition of the right to torpedo merchant-vessels in time of war. 12. All the belligerents are to renounce war contributions or indemnities in any form, but the money spent on the maintenance of prisoners and all contri-butions levied during the war are to be returned. 13. Treaties of commerce shall not be the basis of peace.   Each country is freein regard to commercial policy, but all countries shall agree to renounceeconomic blockades after the war, and not to conclude separate customsunderstandings.14. The conditions of peace shall be laid down at a Peace Congress by delegates chosen by national representative bodies and confirmed by the Parliaments. An undertaking shall be given not to conclude secret treaties, which are declared to be in contravention of international law, and consequently null.15. There shall be a general disarmament on land and sea, accompanied by the creation of a system of militia.The instructions, conclude by recommending that efforts should he made to remove all obstacles in the way of the holding of the Stockholm Conference, and to secure the granting of passports to all those who may desire to attend it.M. Skobeleff, an ex-Minister, has been selected by the Central Committee of the Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Delegates as the representative of Russian democracy at the Paris Conference.   [&quot; Morning Post,&quot; 22nd October.]
Evacuation of Petrograd. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 19th October [No.- 1666] that he gathered from ]VL Tereschenko that it would not be necessary for the Embassy to leave Petrograd for another month. The evacuation had been agreed upon in principle, but no definite decision had been arrived at. The Soviet had hinted that if the Government went to Moscow it would&apos; form a new one in Petrograd, the evacuation of which place it regarded as unnecessary.The Naval Situation. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on &apos; the 17th October [No. 1644] that M. Tereschenko had informed him that the Germans had then virtually complete control of the Gulf of Riga and that M. Tereschenko had suggested that, if we were prepared to lose a certain number of smaller vessels, an entrance to the Baltic could be forced by the &quot;British fleet, the appearance of which, he said, would bring about an immediate radical change in the country. On the following day Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed again [No. 1649] saying that M. Kerensky had appealed to His Majesty&apos;s Government to take some naval action to avert what might prove an irretrievable disaster. Sir G. Buchanan backed the appeal, saying that, the man in the street being ignorant of the present conditions of naval warfare, the impression would gain ground that Russia had. been abandoned by her ally if the Russian fleet were destroyedVithout the British having made an effort to come to its assistance; and then the idea would prevail that the only course open was peace with Germany. Mr. Balfour replied on the 21st October [No. 2165] that he feared that complete ignorance of the character and possibilities of naval warfare was shown by M. Kerensky&apos;s observations on the subject of British naval co-operation in the Baltic, and adduced facts in justification of his opinion.POLAND.Declaration as to Polish Independence [see Eastern Report XXXVIII, p. 2].  Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 17th October [No. 1640] that M. Tereschenko&apos;s declaration to the Polish delegates on the 15th October, after a flattering reference to Kosciusko, whose spirit still animated Polish people, said that from these last years of suffering had arisen a new and proud principle which they were assembled to recognise  the right of peoples to liberty, the right of nations to decide their own lot. He continued as follows : &quot; This principle was publicly proclaimed in the appeal addressed to the Poles on the 30th March, and I now declare that the other Great Powers of the Entente, endorsing the principles proclaimed by the Russian Government in their manifesto to the Poles of the 30th March, recognise that the creation of an independent and indivisible Poland constitutes one of the conditions of a solid and just peace and of the regime of right in Europe.&quot; The declaration ended with a warm tribute to the patriotism of Kosciusko.Mr. Balfour telegraphed on the 22nd October [No. 2170J approving Sir G. Buchanaifs action in regard to this declaration [Eastern Report XXXVIII, p. 5], but saying that he should like to know what was intended exactly by the&quot; word &quot; indivisible.&quot;Question of a Polish Army in Russia. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 19th October [No. 1665] that M. Tereschenko had told him that arrangements could be made for the formation of special Polish army corps as integral parts of the Russian army, but the Government could not consent to the formation of a Polish national army as distinct from the Russian army. M. Tereschenko added that during the retreat last summer one Polish division had to be removed to the rear on account of its bad behaviour  though some other Polish troops had distinguished themselves. M. Kerensky was said to have consented to the introduction of committees in any Polish army corps which might be formed in the future ; this under pressure from the only existing one, in which there is no such committee. But Sir G. Buchanan proposed to impress upon him the inadvisability of such a course.TURKEY.Alleged Peace Proposals from Great Britain. An agent reports that the Turkish Government informed the Germans that an Englishman of high standing, the late manager of the Haifa-Damascus railway, had made peace proposals on behalf of the British Government which undertook inter alia that all Turkish territory should be restored, and that it would take over the debt incurred by Turkey since the outbreak of the war; on their side the Turks were to break with the Central Powers and join the
Allies. The Turks added that they had indignantly refused these overtures. The agent&apos;s informant had this story from Germans who, he said, did not appear to be greatly impressed by it.MOROCCO.German Propaganda. An agent reported at the beginning of the month that the Germans, helped by the Turks, were making great efforts to organise an efficient system of propaganda in this country. Large sums of money were being spent and printed matter was being distributed extensively over Northern Africa. Several Spanish agents had been engaged, and much of the work was being done in Spain,EGYPT.The Ex-Khedive.-An agent reporting that the Ex-Khedive left Switzerland on the 5th October with a suite of forty-two persons says that before doing so he made his adieux to the Federal Council officially as Khedive ; the agent also says that someone in a position to be well informed had reported that before leaving he also paid an official call on the Ex-King of Greece at Zurich.ABYSSINIA.Lij Yasu. On the 16th October Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 66] to Mr. Thesiger saying that a report had been made by his Italian colleague at Adis Ababa in regard to Lij Yasu, to the effect that he was trying to reach Arabia. At the time of the report he was said to be in the plains. Mr. Thesiger was asked whether he could confirm this. He, replied [No. 63] that he had himself reported the news (which was apparently true) to Cairo and Aden ; entire ignorance of Lij Yasu&apos;s whereabouts was, however, professed by the Abyssinian Government.ARABIA.The Shammar.A Large Caravan at Koweit. Sir P. Cox telegraphed on the 21st October [No. 4488] that a large Shammar caravan, bearing letters from Turki Ibn Saud, had arrived at Koweit to obtain rice and dates. Ibn Saud had already written to say that the Shammar tribesmen, with their families, were taking refuge with him, and were giving assurances of their enmity to Ibn Rashid ; they had asked him to help them in getting access to our markets. He believed that if they were well treated they would be permanently with us. The Acting Political Agent at Koweit had telegraphed saying that the Shaykh of that place had complete confidence in the good faith of the caravan. To make as certain as might be that there should be no leakage permission to take supplies was granted only on condition that (1) two leading headmen should remain at Koweit till news had been received of the arrival of the whole caravan at its destination, and (2) the caravan should travel in one body, and should be accompanied to the headquarters of Turki Ibn. Saud by a British officer. Colonel Hamilton, the Political Agent at Koweit, then absent, would be the officer referred to, and nothing was to be removed pending his arrival.In another telegram of the same date Sir P. Cox said the formidable problem of feeding and watering so large a caravan, 3,000 camels, had apparently been too much for the Shaykh, who had allowed it to leave before Colonel Hamilton.&apos;s arrival. The latter had gone to Qasim on the 8th September, and it was hoped that his presence there would be sufficient to prevent leakage of supplies to the enemy.PERSIA.The Cabinet. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 20th October [No. 350] that the fall of the Cabinet seemed imminent, but it was still working. Mushir-ed-Dowleh abandoned his attempt almost at once, as he could get no support. A combination which would suit us, and which seemed probable, was that of Vossugh and Ain-ed-Dowleh.British Relations with Persia. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir C. Marling on the 23rd October [No. 287] authorising him to support Vossugh-ed-Dowleh, and suggesting that it might be possible to consider some modifications in our existing policy ; but Sir C. Marling would realise the undesirability of giving away anything substantial to secure Persia&apos;s goodwill, the value of which was doubtful.
South Persian Rifles. In the same telegram [No. 287] Mr. Balfour said that His Majesty&apos;s Government considered that the wisest course would be to await developments in the general position, so far as might be possible. But it would not be possible (in any case to contemplate the lowering of the prestige of the South Persian Rifles during the war or the loss of control over them.Requested Withdrawal of Russian Troops. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 16th October [No. 346] that the Persian Government asked that His Majesty&apos;s Government (as an ally of Russia) should support its request for the withdrawal of the Bussian troops from Persia. The Persian Government had sent another note to the Russian Legation asking for this, and urging dearth as an additional reason. It expressed the belief that its frontier would not be crossed by the Powers at war with Russia if that Power recalled its troops. Mr. Balfour replied on the 18th October [No. 283] that he did not propose to make the suggested representation to Petrograd, as there was no adequate guarantee that the Turks would not advance ; for which reason he was informing the Persian Minister that His Majesty&apos;s Government was not prepared to withdraw its troops.LATEST INFORMATION.RUSSIA.M. Kerensky. In a telegram dated the 21st October [No. 1676] Sir G. Buchanan said that of late there had been such persistent attacks on M. Kerensky that he might have to go ; but he would cling to power as long as possible. There was no i. one to succeed him, as General Korniloff was no longer an eligible candidate, and in this fact lay his chief hope of safety though leading politicians think that before many months have passed General Korniloff, or failing him some other general, may play a leading part in the strong reactionary movement winch &quot;they think must come. On the same clay Sir G. Buchanan, forwarded [No. 1678] a telegram from the military attache saying that a prominent military officer had told him that M. Kerensky would have to go if be did not take action against the Bolcbevists.Evacuation of Petrograd. Li the same telegram [No. 1676] Sir G. Buchanan said that the belief that Petrograd would not be in danger till the spring was gaining ground, and there was less talk of the removal of the seat of government in the near future. In regard to the taking of Petrograd, Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed from Berne on the 24th October [No. 985] that Fakreddin Bey had been sent to Switzerland he was formerly Turkish Ambassador at Petrograd. According to him the importance to the Turks of the forthcoming taking of Petrograd had been pointed out to them by the Germans, who said that that event would finish off their secular enemies the Russians.-    TURKEY.Talaat Pasha s Speech. An Amsterdam message, dated the 27th September, states that according to a Constantinople telegram, Talaat Pasha closed the Congress of the Committee of Union and Progress with a long speech, in which he justified Turkey&apos;s entry into the war and defended the Turkish treatment of the Armenians. He admitted, however, that it could not be said that the deportations were carried out in a regular manner, as the gendarmes had been incorporated in the army and could not be maintained in the desired manner. But the Ottoman Government had sent several commissions of investigation, and those who had been guilty of misdeeds had been condemned to the severest punishment, and even to death. With reference to the report that Mr. Henry Morgenthau, formerly American ambassador to Turkey, had taken a journey to Europe in order to prepare means for the foundation of a Jewish -state, Talaat Pasha said that the Porte had learned officially from the United States through the Swedish legation that this was not the object of Mr. Morgenthau&apos;s visit to Europe. Referring to the Pope&apos;s note, he declared that the Government adhered to the principle of arbitration, and concluded with these words : &quot; Regarding the question of disarmament, we shall oppose no solution that is compatible with our vital interests. Nobody can say to-day when peace will come, but it is obvious that we are approaching the end.&quot; &apos;[898-66] C
EGYPT.The Arab Legion. There is good authority for saying that the Arab Legion is progressing and shaping well.ARABIA.Mission to Ibn Saud. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir R. Wingate on the 25th October [No. 1013J, in reply to the latter&apos;s telegram of the 5th October [Eastern Report XXXVII, p. 4], approving in principle the despatch of a mission to Ibn Saud.MESOPOTAMIA.The-Proposed Sikh Temple at Basra [see Eastern Report XXXV1T, p. 10 and Appreciation I. Mr. Montagu telegraphed to the viceroy on the 19th October saying that it had been represented to him that the Arabs would resent the erection of a Sikh temple on the sacred soil of Mesopotamia as the establishment of idolatry ; he was disposed to think that it was not desirable to erect permanent places of worship, other&apos;than Moslem, in Mesopotamia so long, at any rate, as our occupation remained provisional.
APPENDIX I.Extracts from Weekly &quot; Intelligence Summaries &quot; of British Military Attache, Meshed.(1-)225. Khiva and Bokhara. Both the Amir of Bokhara and the Khan of Khiva have published manifestos of constitutional reforms, the latter, in addition, having released all prisoners.The progressive element at Bokhara is not satisfied with the programme, and on this account some disorder occurred, incidentally showing the extraordinary relations prevailing between the Russian Resident (as the Political Agent has been rechristenecl) and present Tashkent authority. On the 21st April some trouble occurred between manifestants for freedom and armed reactionary mullahs, and the Resident, who was visiting the Amir, was detained all, day at the palace. Manifestants were arrested, and Russian troops sent for from Samarkand. A report was subsequently sent to the Provisional Government by Colonel Cherkes that the Amir was acting oppressively, and was being supported in his attitude by the Resident (A. Miller). The latter was informed by Cherkes, acting for the Tashkent Committee, that he was to permit no executions, those arrested were to be released, and that he and the Amir would be held jointly and personally responsible for any bloodshed. On disregard of these instructions armed force would be employed, if necessary. Miller subsequently reported that he had secured the release of the arrested, persons. A company of infantry had arriveo at New Bokhara. These he had personally conducted to Bokhara, through which they had marched headed by the Resident and with the red nag flying ; order had been completely restored.(Summary for week ending May 5, 1917.)(2-) &apos;    .233. Bokhara. In a letter to the &quot; Askhabad &quot; M. Miller denies the imputations of oppressive conduct made against the Amir and himself, and states that bo/th are actuated by a d-sire for the reform of the regime of the State on liberal lines. He asserts that the recent disorders were entirely the work of fanatical clergy provoked by the injudicious conduct of manifestants, against whose action he had made strong but unavailing protests.(Summary for week ending May 12, 1917.)(3.)251. Bokhara and Khiva. A meeting of the New Bokhara Executive Committee, attended by all Russian inhabitants, after a stormy session resulted in accusations against M. Miller of double-dealing and demands for his removal. A letter written by a member of his staff to a Cazi, proving his reactionary sympathies, was produced, and it was decided to place the matter in the hands of the Samarkand Committee, who were present on the occasion.Distrust is expressed in the manifesto of the Khan of Khiva, the frequent references in it to the Shariat being taken to nullify all practical benefits. It is recalled that in 1905, under pressure, the Khan issued orders for a constitution^ which ho revoked subsequently after a short interval.(Summary for week ending May 19, 1917.)
343. Khiva and&quot;Bokhara. Turkistan authorities have received an application from the Khivan commander of.troops for the despatch of a Cossack regiment with machine guns to quell disorders arising from Yomud Turkomans, domiciled at Khiva, plundering the district and in particular one town, half of which was plundered by them, and the remaining half -more germanico placed under contribution. Considering that the attitude of the Yomud was motived by their unsatisfactory status at Khiva and their desire for Russian citizenship, the authorities decided to instruct the Petro-Alexandrovsk Executive Committee to ascertain the Yomuds&apos; grievances and to report on the necessity for the despatch of troops. A colonel and native delegates were deputed to Khiva as a special measure.An article in the &quot; Utro Rossiyi &quot; apparently inspired by the Yonng-Bokharan party paints a lurid picture of a troublous future for Bokhara, in which Turkistan and even Afghanistan and Persia may be involved. M. -Miller has been removed and arrested ; bis successor, enjoys no influence ; the Amir, full of good intentions, is a puppet in the hands of the reactionary mullahs and officials.M. Klemm, of the Asiatic Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, is characterised as an open reactionary, and his past policy held accountable for the present impasse.M. Evedenski, titular vice-consul 1 at Urmia and attached to the&apos; Bokhara residency, is confirmed as district commissary for Prussian settlements in Bokhara.(Summary for week ending July 7, 1917.)373. Bokhara.- An intelligent Persian merchant resident at Bokhara gives the following account of the disturbances - there last April, and subsequent events. (Reference paragraphs 225, 238, 251, and 343.) On the publication of the Amir&apos;s manifesto the Young-Bokharans obtained the Residents (Miller) consent to their attending the Amir with congratulations. Some 300 in number, and joined en route by about 100 Persian sympathisers, they were approaching the palace when intelligence reached them that the mullahs, armed and numbering several thousand, bad &quot;assembled to attack them. They therefore dispersed, but subsequently several of their leaders were arrested by the Khush be given, taken, to the ark, and most severely flogged&apos;. They were then imprisoned in the ark. Certain of the party, however, reached Kaghan, whence they despatched a telegram to M. Miliukhov at petrograd, and another to Tashkent, asking for protection. The reply to this message placed the responsibility of any loss of life on the Amir and his advisers, and in consequence a detachment of Cossacks was sent from Kaghan by the Resident to bring the prisoners to the residency.While waiting outside the ark one of the Cossacks&apos; horses was shot by a mullah, and a Cossack was wounded on the head by a stone. Without engaging the crowd the Cossacks escorted the prisoners to Kaghan, where one of them, a respectable merchant named Mirza Nasrullah, succumbed to his injuries. 500 Russian troops with two machine guns were sent to Bokhara, where they remained for some weeks, after which they were withdrawn, 100 men only still being retained at Kaghan. -Some time subsequently, by a curious chance, a letter written by Miller (or one of his staff) on the occasion of the demonstration to the Qazi Qalan, the executive head of the mullahs, came to light. The Qazi was enjoined to await the arrival of the Young-Bokharans at the ark, where they were to be seized, and (it is said) executed, Miller taking all responsibility. The letter was taken to the Kaghan Executive Committee, who apparently implicitly accepted its authenticity, and arrested Miller, despatching him to Russia. The Khush be given and Qazi Qalan were dismissed, and their posts have now been filled by adherents to the Young-Bokharan party ;The Amir is said to have asked the Russian delegates subsequently sent to Bokhara in connection with reforms for time to introduce them without arousing the active opposition of the mullahs. -The Amir is apparently in a difficult position, as the mullahs are all-powerful.
particularly in the out-districts., where the people are, in ignorance of their real interests, absolutely under the mullahs&apos; thumb. Outside Bokhara itself the lives HI of adherents to the Young-Bokharan party are unsafe, and two respectable citizens suspected of adhering to it were recently hauled out of the train at Guzar, and &quot; ith difficulty escaped with their lives. The vested pecuniary interests of the mullahs are very large-, and they are aware that these would be more than compromised by the introduction of liberal reforms. Young Bokharans belong to all classes of the population, of which they are the most enlightened element.Owing to the want of rain, and the failure of water for irrigation in the Zarafshan, the harvest has proved a failure, and the people are in great straits for grain. Their condition is, however, better than that of the inhabitants of Turkisran. There is practically famine in Ferghana at Andijan, Khokand, &amp;e, and great scarcity among the native population at Tashkent. In a recent stay of five days at Tashkent my informant was onhy once able to obtain bread. Although officially   lb. per diem can be obtained on a bread-ticket, it involves waiting for most of the day.My informant was of opinion that if peace be delayed for more than a few months longer, serious disorders must inevitably arise both in Turkistan and Bokhara on the ground of scarcity of&apos;provisions and all necessary commodities. He did not think diese would have primarily, at any rate any political significance. He had heard rumours of German provocative agents in Bokhara, but had no personal knowledge of any such action. Troubles would, in all probability, commence in Ferghana, where distress is more acute.Tire Russians in Turkistau are very nervous of hostile Afghan action, but, as far as his knowledge extended, quite without cause.Incidentally he mentioned conversations he had had on railway journeys, since the revolution, with Russian soldiers in which the latter expressed their hopes of the speedy conclusion of a separate peace. They blamed the British for ail their misfortunes and hoped to be able to join the Germans in operations against India and elsewhere. Before the revolution such opinions were never heard.This is by no means the first time I have heard of the expression of such opinions, of which the excellent Saratov militia, among others, were exponents. Discount as one may the opinions of ignorant men, their free expression, among an oriental population in particular, is not calculated to enhance the native conception of the loyalty and durability of the Anglo-Russian alliance.(Summary for week ending July 28, 1917.)APPENDIX II.Arabs in Dutch East Indies and Straits Settlements^. - j? (By Mr. Lee Warner,/W*efer- 4ee&quot;MSte*se^It is impossible to describe in a few pages the complicated position existing at present in the Dutch East Indies with regard to the Arabs, the Japanese, the Javanese, and Bugis (viewed in the light of the Sarikat-Islam movement). An attempt is made to set out briefly the position of the Arabs; their present and their potential influence; the need of &quot; help &quot; from the British, to which they are always referring. These Arabs, coming from the Pladramaut as they do, and passing through Singapore, where also there is a strong Arab community, feel that, though living for mo4 of their lives under the Dutch Government, they&apos;are more closely related to the British, for (I) they despise the Dutch, (2) the Hadramaut is only reached through Singapore and Aden, and (3) they feel sure that the near future will see Japan occupying Borneo and desirous of Java, while Britain must, they consider, either take or &quot;protect&quot; Sumatra so as to oust the German influence, which has already seized Sumatra&apos;s west coast from Bencoolen to Padang and on to Sibolga. The writer would add that when stationed at Sabang (January-April, 1917) ample evidence was collected of Get manic activity and propaganda for making Sabang a German-controlled coaling station after the war to compete with Singapore. This would complete the german chain from Bencoolen right up to Pulau Way, a chain whose forging began with the German missions round Padang, which are most active with the Moslem populationBy &quot; help &quot; to the Arabs as used in the following pages is not meant actual help as against the Dutch Government, but &quot; help&quot; in their intercourse with their old home,898-66] Dr
the Hadramaut. If Britain &quot;helps&quot; in this, she will gain Arab sympathy all over the Malay archipelago and peninsula, a matter of great import.The Arabs in the Dutch East Indies and the Straits Settlements are practically all from the Hadramaut. Their numbers in Java and the&quot; Celebes (they are few in Sumatra ; those that are in Sumatra are mainly down near Palembang) are said to reach 40,000. Many of these are very rich ; their great activity as traders, coupled with their acute business sense, renders them powerful; their instinct for combination, shown, in founding and endowing nominally religious, but in reality strongly&quot;political, schools or colleges, their self-reliance and knowledge of the Koran, all result in their holding a very influential place among the teeming millions of the Javanese. Since the Russo-Japanese war the activities of the Sarikat-Islam have increased enormously, and the near future will show to what extent the Arabs are going to try and gain ascendancy over the counsels of the Javanese and Malay. There is little doubt that the Arabs will compete with and are eager to oust the already somewhat large influence which the Japanese have obtained over the Javanese and Bugis. The Arabs at present are by no means pro-British, but many of their leaders are ready to come under our influence and to follow our advice. The present would therefore be the moment to endeavour to obtain their hearty and genuine goodwill, and that for three reasons : 1. Effectually to oust the German efforts to enlist their sympathy. .2. By gaining the Arabs over, thereby to have them on our side when theyendeavour (as they shortly will) to gain the leading word among thefollowers of the Sarikat-Islam movement. 3. By fostering this pro-British sentiment to use the Arabs as leaders against the /  Japanese emissaries, who are preaching the  &quot; Indies for the natives &quot;propaganda.   The success of such a doctrine would inevitably react in adisadvantageous way for us in the Malay peninsula.Singapore and Penang, in the Straits Settlements, carry an influential core of Arabs, closely related to the Java and Celebes Arab settlers, but the Arabs of Java consider themselves, and are considered bv their Singapore brothers, as the leading community. But this preponderating influence, due partly to wealth, partly to larger numbers, and partly to longer local standing, wielded by the Arabs in the Dutch East Indies is to some extent balanced hj the respect for British administration and justice held by the British subjects, the Singapore and Straits Arabs.Thus a useful fulcrum is in British hands which can be used, and should now, if ever, be so used and applied towards proving to the Dutch East. Indies Arabs that the British can help if they are willing to do so. Singapore has influenced the Dutch East Indies Arahs thus far already, in that they actually look for &quot; help &quot; impatiently by now, it is to be feared-from the British and not from their Dutch rulers. As a rule the Dutch East Indies Arab is ready to come to the British consulate-general in Batavia. If he finds a Malay-speaking officer there, by so much the more is he pleased.In short, if we act promptly, even though our helping action be small, we now have the opportunity forthwith to win over Arab feeling throughout the Dutch East Indies, with the prospect of keeping the intellectual and commercial leaders of the whole Mohammedan communities permanently on our side.It suffices here to emphasise the fact that it is now towards us British and no longer towards the Germans that the Hadramaut colonies in the Dutch East Indies and Singapore look. For years past their contempt for the Dutch has been an established fact. After the Russo-Japanese war their ideas for Pan-Islam set towards a speedy hope that Japan might be their model and help ; this idea is mainly dispelled as will be shown later. But the impetus towards self-assertion was born, and in 1914 the German campaign had turned the Arabs&apos; judgment. German influence  subsidisation by the German consulate-general with its monetary promises and its Turkish alliance moving on the. steady, well-calculated German system, had supplanted all other influences, and the opening phases of the war began to clinch the matter to our disadvantage. In Batavia the power of Mongus, the Arab &quot; captain,&quot; whose municipal bribery had placed the whole Dutch municipal staff of the capital at his feet, was a most potent influence for evil. Mongus had the Turkish consul-general at his mercy ; he bad the main part of the vernacular press as his organ ; and he. voiced in no uncertain fashion the belief which be felt in the German propaganda with its specious Islamic promises.Even in Singapore, where they had amassed under British protection such large fortunes, the Arabs were beginning to feel the agitation.   But Syed Omar Alsagoff, the
head of the community, in spite of the efforts which the Germans no doubt made to influence him, stood firm in his loyalty. Though decorated in the past by the Sultan of Turkey ; though holding large house property in Mecca and Arabia; though wedded to a Turkish lady; he nevertheless used all his undoubted power in preaching loyalty to Britain, offering his houses at Mecca for any purpose to which the British Govern-meni might desire to put them. On Turkey joining the Germans, an active pro-German campaign was energetically carried out throughout the Dutch Indies; the leaders were the German consul-general, Helfferich; Diehh, the Turkish consul-general; Mongus and his subordinates. The Arab communities centre round the ports, Batavia, Cheribon, Samaraug, Sourabaya, Tjilatjap, Macassar. The vernacular press in Batavia, &amp;c, published articles by the Turkish consul-general written in Malay and Javanese, decrying the British and emphasising the German advance. Vague but splendid promises were freely thrown out, and there is no doubt that the Arabs and many of the Sarikat-Islam leaders believed in these and also in the speedy downfall of British power.The immediate quelling of the 5th Light Infantry outbreak in Singapore and the trial and execution of the treacherous Mansur showed thinking Arabs that we were ready to meet difficulties promptly ; and the news of these rebuffs to treachery soon reached across to Java. This,&apos;coupled with the vigorous and brilliant efforts of our consul-general in Batavia, the late Mr. W. R. A. Beckett, C.M.G., resulting in periodic additions to the statutory list and in the throttling of German trade and German agents proved that the German-Turkish tales of continuous successes were hollow and false.As a result approaches were made by some leading Say ids in Batavia to Mr. Beckett, and after a good deal of discussion and delay due to their innate caution and love of mystery, together with their fear that the Dutch Government might resent any &quot; political &quot; activity on their part, certain pro-British Arabs crystallised their desires as follows, setting out their position and hopes on the subjoined lines : 1. We are all Hadramaut Arabs. We are an influential band. Amongst Arabs here in Java we have many famous Sayids and preachers, who can sway their audiences at will. Our meetings are gaining in frequency, and large numbers of Malays and Javanese now attend them.2. At first Mongus and his party, holding the native press, spread broadcast pro-German literature, and hinted at glowing promises given by the Germans.3. As the war progressed, while it is true that these German promises never came to anything definite, the British not only did nothing but a system was brought into effect necessitating endless questions, &quot; passes,&quot; voyage through Singapore, interrogations there, interrogations at Aden, &amp;c, before any of us could reach our homes in the Hadramaut.4. Thus resentment was aroused against the British at the very time when the British should have seized their chance of helping us when we were becoming alive to the hollowness of German and Turkish promises. But now you are beginning to move.5. Many of us rejoiced when the Shereef of Mecca broke with Turkey. But why has no &quot; fetwah&quot; come from him? Why do you British not send &quot; Al Kiblah &quot; 1 All you have done is to send us an illustrated paper  &quot; Al Hakikat &quot; with Arabic notes to the pictures.6. You ought to send us &quot; Al Kiblah,&quot; an Arabic paper with Arabic articles ; we do not want pictures.7. You ought to make a post of Mokalla with a British consular officer. If that is impossible because y^ou British think the Shereef might be offended, surely you can appoint at Mokalla an Arab official from one of your known supporters in the Straits or here.8. Thus you could prove your active help, and give us also a post-office, and a money order system direct. Later, perhaps, a telegraph and the cessation of all these &quot; passes,&quot; photographs, consular certificates, questions as to why we wish to go to our old home, why we wish to take so much money to our old parents, &amp;c. &apos;-9. If you do this you will find almost all of us coming to your support. We influence the Malays and Javanese. We distrust the Japanese, who are active among the Javanese. We know Sumatra is in a ferment and that the Dutch are on the edge of a volcano. You should remember that if you do not help Japan will help us in a different way.   She will send
us rifles, &amp;c, later on. Take your opportunity, and if you do not want Sumatra and Java for yourselves at any rate see you do not push them into German or Japanese hands. Dp not forget that in-your Straits Settle-ments and Malay States you are under-populated while Java has over 30,000,000 Javanese. Why not get their sympathy ? 10. And that sympathy you will only get by prompt help of us Arabs. We can influence, the Javanese, even yet, but you are late in the field and the Japanese are everywhere.The writer was entrusted by Mr. Beckett with the work of getting into touch with the Arabs, and after many conversations with leading Arabs, such as Syed Mahomed and Syed-al-Junid, in Batavia, he elicited the above points of information. It was obvious that the Mongus party was losing power, but at the same time the prosecution by the Dutch Government of certain Sarikat-Islam leaders, like Kromo and others, showed that these men were deeply tinged with Japanese ideas, had a great interest in Japan, and looked on Japan as an Asiatic country which had shown that it was equal to any European Power.These loyal Arabs were clearly impressed by the fear that the Javanese national movement would throw itself into Japan&apos;s hands. Doubtless, did this happen, the Arab influence with the Javanese would go. Thus their fears were clearly selfish, but at the same time they felt, as does also the writer, that it would be better for British prestige in Arabia, India, the Malay countries, Siam, &amp;c, if the British were the model and not the Japanese. And they pointed out that they still were the intellectual leaders of Islam in the East. If we &quot;helped&quot; them now in the sense above indicated they would easily obtain the withdrawal of practically all the Arabs from Mongus and the Germano-Turkish party, and thus their united influence would be pro-British, and they could and would use it to infect the Javanese with the same idea. They felt, as did Mr. Beckett, that the rottenness of the Dutch administration could only lead and was already leading to the early end of Dutch rule in the Indies ; that it therefore behoved Great Britain (another European Power) to uphold at once the European prestige ; that if she did not do something, however small, now to show her sympathy with the Hadramaut and its children, the time would pass and Japan would be the ideal. The Japanese were even now seizing all the trade, and although Japanese cheap goods were clearly not so good or so cheap as British goods, yet Britain must evince her sympathy until she could again send out goods, or else Japan would have the market as well as the political leadership.PRINTED   AT THE FOREIGN OfFICK BY C.

SITUATION   OF   THE   SHERIFIAN   REVOLTAnother Pilgrimage has come and. gone with Medina still in Ottoman hands and no such decisive victory achieved as would ensure Arab independence, even in the Hejaz. Like all other operations of the Great War, of which it is a part, the Arab Revolt is a lone&apos; slow business. But looking; back over the last three summer months, we can mark substantial progress. At the beginning of July the northernmost base of the Sherifian armies was at Wejh, where Feisal had been since the end of January, and their farthest outpost to the north was at Muweilab. The serious, but not sustained, attacks on the railway, which were begun in February, had not affected any point north of Tebuk. Abdullah was in Wadi Ais, acting fitfully and without consistent plan against the southern section of the line. All and Zeid remained south-west of Medina unable to isolate the garrison of Bir el-Mashi from Headquarters, but, with help from Abdullah, fairly successful in preventing the relief of Medina from the direction of Henakiyah and the East. No tribe lying north of the Billi. except some incon-siderable constituents of the Ben! Atiyah and the Huweitat, had yet come into action.At the close of September we find Feisal with the main base of operations moved up to Akaba, the extreme northerly point of the Peninsula, and there he is to be joined by Zeid and most of the &quot;regular&quot; constituents of the latter&apos;s army. Outposts have been established Eastward,beyondGueira, some thirty miles from Maan. and as far North as Wadi Musa near Petra (or even at. Shobak), from, which point communication is open with Kerak. Touch with our Sinai forces is about to be established through Nakhl. Abdullah and Ali remain in. their old positions, but it is proposed that the former shall soon move north to Jeyadah, while the latter reports that he has isolated Bir el-Mashi. Beyond increasing his outposts in the immediate environs of Medina the enemy has made no sustained advance either from that city or from the railway south of Maan, i.e., he has resigned himself to holding no more of North-West Arabia than the northern Holy City and one line of communication thereto. This hold is undoubtedly weaker than it was, and he has more than once thought of abandoning it. As for Medina, the most recent reports from deserters, etc.. show that about a. sixth only of the civil population now remains ; that many buildings have been wrecked to provide fuel for the railway, while private houses have been sacked ; that bare necessities for the troops have run very low, while luxuries and proper forage have practically ceased ; and that little coined money is in. circulation. As regards the railway, while better organized and sustained raids have been made on the southern section under the experienced direction of British officers, and with regular troops, Egyptian and Arab, the area of attack has been extended
northward, to Maan and oven beyond. At the same time the north Arabian section, from .Maan to Medain Salih, has not been neglected. September saw much raiding activity on both sides of Tebuk, and one of the most serious disasters which lias occurred on the line, the wrecking of a clouble-engined train on a culvert, near Haret Ammar, on the 19th (See p. .401).It is not possible to give an accurate total of breaks effected, still less of rails or even bridges cut. The Arab reports often tell of so man.)&apos; &quot;kilometres destroyed.&quot; In such cases we can presume several breaks over the distance claimed, but certainly not demolition of the whole length, nor, necessarily, demolition of both rails at any point. Nor can we be sure that many rails have been damaged beyond re-use (see Colonel jSTewcombe&apos;s remarks, on p. 407). As for the &quot;bridges,&quot; they are rarely more than, culverts.   *.During the three months just about thirty raids have been made upon the long stretch between Bowat in the south and 11 nadir el - Ha j in the north (7(10 kilometres). The total of rails reported to have been dealt with is 7,630, plus an undefined number assailed by purely Arab parties, which have not reported details of their achievements. On the face of the reports, we might assume an inclusive total of not less than 10,000 rails. But certain reservations must be made. Only on a few occasions have even British-led parties been able to inspect their work after firing their charges. Purely Arab parties never inspect. Charges fired do not necessarily mean an equal number of rails damaged ; still less do they mean rails damaged irretrievably. As Colonel Newcombe says (p. 407). if a five metre length of rail is unhurt, it is left in position. We may, therefore, safely deduct at least 25% from the above assumed total of rails destroyed ; and if we conclude that the Turks have had to replace 7,500 in all during the three months, we shall perhaps be still somewhat above the mark. Whether this be so, however, or not, the local reserves are known to be nearing exhaustion. Medina, which is reported by a reliable deserter to have had three, large stacks of spare rails at the beginning of the year, has now only a remnant of one of these. Most sidings have been taken up along the line south of Maan ; and it is reported that Fakhri Pasha, to quiet the apprehensions of his men, has had to put it ahroacl that wooden rails will be used.As for &quot; bridges,&quot; we have had the demolition of over thirty reported during the period, but of these perhaps only one, the bridge north of Abu Naam, is more substantial than a culvert. In the case of culverts the practice of the Turks is to fill in the gaps with earth and relay the rails atop. It is probable, therefore, that as soon as the rains have come down, they will have some automatic breaks to deal with, which will call for more thorough reparation. On the Haret Ammar bridge, broken on September 19, the G\O.C.&apos;s instruction was to effect
only such temporary repairs as would just allow the passage of trains. Demolition of telegraph plant is rarely reported to us in detail and is often neglected by purely Arab raiders. We have heard during the three months of about two miles of telegraph line demolished at two points, and of some hundred poles, with wire, destroyed elsewhere, besides several mere cuts. Some interruption of the lines has, indeed, taken place about every second day. Apart from these interruptions, the Turkish military authorities are known to have had, and be having, continual difficulties owing to the overloading of their land wire, the inadequate capacity of their wireless, and the disinclination of the railway authority to allow them full use of the traffic wire.While the supply of water to stations, unprovided with water-towers or wells, has not yet proved so serious as might -have been expected, the fuel question is causing ever graver uneasiness to the enemy south of Maan. We.know that some south-bound trains have had the utmost difficulty in getting through on their supply, and that it has been necessary to hold them up for hours at stations till wood-fuel could be brought down. There is only one good source of supply for the whole 800 odd kilometres south, of Maan, namely, the Hish forest in the Shobak district, to which a light branch line six miles long has been laid. It is to safeguard this, quite as much as to cut communica-tions between Feisal and Kerak, that the Turks are so anxious to regain control of Wadi Musa. It will be recalled that Major Lawrence, during his great raid in July, appeared at both Shobak and Hish.The upshot of the matter, however, is this : that the railway south of Maan had not been permanently cut by the end of September. In spite of ever increasing difficulties, of whose effect on the local commands we have ample evidence, the Turks have been able to keep up intermittent communication with Medina and to supply the bare necessities of the H.E.F. and the two Composite Forces, as well as those of Ibn Rashid and his following of some 1,000 men. The position of these forces, therefore, is not yet desperate, and, indeed, in the face of the outer&apos; world, is little different from what it was in June except, perhaps, for the increasing disaffection of the Beni Atiyah and open defection of the Fuqara and southern Wuld Ali, counter-balanced to some extent by continued neutrality on the part of most of the Billi. .. They have had, in appearance, an accession of strength hy the arrival of the Emir of Hail and his men ; but, in reality, the character of the Emir himself, the temper of his followers, and the drain of supplies, caused by their arrival, more than counterbalance the advantage of their presence, either on the L. of C. or in Medina itself. On the whole, seeing what the retention of Medina and of the long L. of C. is entailing on (he Ottoman General Staff, we may look with equanimity on a&apos; prolongation of the present situation.
The enemy&apos;s position at Maan itself must react with in-creasing detriment on his difficulties further south. There, with a. long stretch of L. of C. to safeguard, &apos; south and north, with the all important Hish district to protect and Wadi Musa to recover, with the enemy based at Akaba, and in force no further off than about thirty miles having further to reckon with the hostility of all the greater local tribes, and the imminent opening of direct communication between the latter and our Sinai arm)&apos; the Turkish G.O.C. can rely on only six weak battalions and the doubtful support of a few of the smaller Kerak, Shobak and Huweitat clans. He cannot attack Wadi Musa in. force without exposing to grave peril Fuweilah, his chief outpost now held by two battalions, and leaving his H..Q. at Maan with no more than one cavalry regiment, which, has been reported by its 0.0. too weak to sit its horse&apos;s or fight. On the other hand, though Audah aba Tayyi, at Gueira, is a. more daring and effective Bedouin leader than nny the Turks have had against them in Hejaz, he is, like all his bind, some-what unaccountable and open to other than purely military considerations. He may he induced to forbear just when, he could strike most decisively. Of the forces at present at Feisal&apos;s disposal, Auclah&apos;s following is the only element with, which a serious offensive could be undertaken. Jaafai &apos;s &quot; regulars,&quot; with their indifferent officers, are hardly to be- relied on for more than defensive operations, and ZeicVs &quot; regulars&quot; will not be much better when they arrive. While Akaba is fairly secure with its garrison and protecting British monitor, Fuweilah and Maan may not prove to be in so precarious a situation as represented, even if the 0.0.0. draws on their garrison strength for a Wadi Musa expedition. The success of this expedition will depend in the main on the action taken by Audah and the Huweitat, and the attitude of the chief Shobak and Kerak clans. About the latter&apos;s disposition we presume Akaba&apos;has more information than we possess. We can only note, as to the good, that the Mujali Sheikh, the principal man in Kerak and chief of a clan actually detailed by the Turk to guard their L. of C. at Kutrani, north of Maan, has visited Feisal recently.The hour even now has not struck for bringing in the Arabs of the Syrian Desert, the trans-Jordan lands, and Syria proper : but considerable progress has been made in preparations for their co-operation. Nuri Shaalan and his son, Nawwaf, have re-affirmed their loyalty and readiness and have asked that their Ruwallah may buy necessary supplies in&apos; our controlled Mesopotamia!! markets. If this is allowed, we shall acquire a strong pull on them and their chiefs. Ibn Hadhdhal and the Amarat maintain their friendly attitude to us, and lately we have had news of the two remaining.greater constituents of the Northern Anazeh, the Feclaan and the Seba, drawing away from the Turks in the north and rallying towards Ibn Hadhdhal. The Beni Sakhr have been embittered against the Turks by the.
death of Fawwaz el-Faiz, which is believed universal!)&apos; to have been caased by foul play ; and, as indicated above, the main body of the Huweitat, and some elements of important Kerak and Belqawiyah clans have already come into action.ARABIA.North-West.intelligence.There is a hitch about Sherif ZeicTs move to Akaba. During his halt en route in Wadi Ais, Abdullah has persuaded him to stay on, ostensibly to join in an offensive operation against the railway. There is a money question behind ZeicVs action and, possibly, some fraternal jealousies lurk behind that again. Feisabs pecuniary demands, owing to the large and indefinite area of operations and of tribal elements with which he lias now to deal from Akaba, have grown much above his allotment, and the diversion of sums from one brother to another, and the grant of extraordinary sums by us to one and not another, have caused soreness. We have had this sort of trouble before in the matter of transport animals and stores detained en route and shall have it again. After all, such unauthorized levying of necessaries in transit is not unknown to more regular generals ! Cairo and Jicldah are doing their best to get the financial distribution adjusted. Meanwhile the food crisis at Akaba has been relieved for the present.From the southern sectitfn of the railway, Sherif Abdullah has reported a successful raid carried out by a Billi Sheikh, Abdullah Muhanna, north of el-Ula. He claims 230 rails damaged and ten Turks killed. Also another raid on the Bir Nasif-Bowat section, which cut four culverts, and &quot; destroyed eight kilometres&quot; of track. There has been, lastly, a serious attack made between Seil Matara and Zumurrucl which has cut communications and put over 100 rails out of action. We await a detailed report of this. Abdullah further states that he is reconnoitring the line up) to and beyond Abu Naain, presumably with a view to.the combined offensive which he proposes to take with his brother, Zeid (see above). Suleiman Rufadah, of the Billi, is now reported gone to Syria and there has been no news of him for some time.The only important operation to be recorded on the northern section is Major La,wrence&apos;s raid at Haret Am mar detailed below (p. 401). The Turks have demonstrated their ability to keep the railway open by getting Memduh Bey, the &quot; Surra-Eniini&quot; (Almoner of the Holy Places), through to Medina on September 27, just in time for Bairam. On his passage through Tebuk, the chief Beni Atiyah sheikh and others demanded their usual surra, but were refused it, presumably on the logical ground that they had had no hay to guard this year. They took the refusal ill, and were quieted with difficulty by a promise of receiving their money on Memduh&apos;s return passage.   As the likelihood of their getting it
then (Damascus has reported it has no coin to spare) is very small, we may look (as do the Turks) for their defection in the near future. The O.C.&apos;s both at Tebuk and Maan arc asking nervously and insistently for reinforcements of men and guns, which Damascus will not send. Disease, desertion, and Arab raids are steadily reducing the Composite force, while the Maan command, as said on p. 898, is up against the extreme difficulty of holding on to its outposts at Fuweilah, Ohi and Merifa, if it is to make any serious effort to regain Wadi Musa. Some small Kerak and Shobak chins have been summoned to help guard the inadequately defended line south of Amman. This is a pis filler, seeing how fickle is the loyalty of the local, clans.The poor quality of the7th Cavalry Regiment, now in garrison at Maan, was demonstrated on the night of. September 28-29, when a dismounted corps, drawn from it, was unable, to save a, repair-gang from suffering di.sa.stcr on the Hish. line, and losing thirty-one prisoners, while its train was wrecked front and rear. The cavalrymen were then withdrawn and replaced by an infantry battalion from Ohi. Another report on this affair, from an Arab source;, which puts the prisoners at twenty-three only, states that mounted troops of feisal&apos;s drove three companies of Mule M.I. (detachment of dismounted 7th Cavalry Regiment?) out of Shobak and occupied the place temporarily;The majority of the horses at Maan are now unfit for service, and if better accommodation, than exists at present, is not provided before winter sets in on the bleak plateau, the mortality among the enemy&apos;s camels will, be even greater than among his horses.An encounter is reported to have taken place atel-G-haymar ( ?) (stated by King Husein to be west of Aneizalnand south-west of Boreidah), between a force under Turki, son of the Emir of Riyadh, and a mixed body of Abclah Shammar under one of the Ajil sheikhs, ancl of some Beni Salim Harb under Ibn Nahit el-Hanafiyah. The first force is affirmed by King Husein to have been the assailant, and the latter to have been friendlies, not Rashidite adherents, as Turki pretended. They were indeed, he says, operating against the Emir of Hail. We do not know the. truth of this matter, or the precise location of the fight (can it be el-Gathmar, 280 miles from Mecca and about 200 from Boreidah, on the Sultani road between these towns) ? But it has caused the King to reaffirm his&apos; suspicions of Ibn Saud. Beyond compensating families of victims, however, he says he will take no action. Twenty men were killed. Ibn Ajil. and Ibn Nahit have since arrived in Mecca.A report of the recent Pilgrimage will be issued later. The total number of pilgrims, who went to Arafat this year, is stated to have been 70,000, inclusive of 30,000 from Nejd and Yemen,
from which districts hardly anyone came last year. Six hundred of these Yemen pilgrims are reported to have taken service with King Huseiii. Health has been very satisfactory, no suspicious case of death having occurred during the whole Pilgrimage. The death-rate of Mecca itself, with its population of 80,000, during the last month of the Moslem year, is returned at only 2-25 per 1,000. There was no trouble about the Muna Sermon this time, and the only untoward incident was caused by the irruption, of some Yemeni dancers into the King&apos;s tent. On. being ejected, one of them stabbed a guard, and in spite of the Chief Cadi.&apos;s intervention, was killed by the soldiery. The father of the Emir of Riyadh, the aged &quot;Imam&quot; Abdurrahman, did not persevere after doing four stations towards Mecca ; but he sent on his second son, Emir Mohammed, with a large part)7, including ninety women. Ten horses arid thirteen riding camels accompanied them as presents to King Husein. The latter had a camp prepared two marches from Mecca and personally received the party on arrival. On its departure after the Pilgrimage, it received lavish presents, and the Emir Mohammed has expressed great gratification at the treatment accorded to him. The latter, however, is not a man of much intelligence or weight with his brother ; and we must not expect any great political consequence from this intercourse.[Later News. There are indications that Hauran Druses arid Ruwallah are about to attack the railway near Deraa. Scurvy is serious on the L. of C, South of Medain Salih. The fuel question has become worse owing to interruption of supplies from Hish, and the food difficulty, on. the L. of C, South of el-Ala, is almost as serious. The Circassian Regiment has been sent up from Tebuk to Maan.]Raid at Baret Ammar.The following report on his raid has been furnished by Major Lawrence, OB. :    -I left Akaba on September 7, with the two British gun instructors, and two Sheikhs of the Ageilat Beiii Atiyah, from Mudowarrah. My hope was to raise 300 men in Gueira and take Mudowarrah station.We rode gently to Gueira, where were a large camp, little water, and great tribal heartburnings. The three sub-tribes. I was relying on were not yet paid, and Audah abu Tayi was making-trouble by his greediness and his attempt to assume authority over all the Huweitat. It was impossible to get either men or camels, so I moved to Rum, five hours S.S.E. of Gueira. There are good springs, difficult of access, at Rum, some pasturage, and the most beatiful sandstone cliff scenery.At Rum the Dhumaniyah came in on September 12, muti-nous. The situation became unpleasant, so I. rode to Akaba, saw Feisal, and returned on the 13th with the promise of twenty baggage camels, and Sherif Abdullah ibn Hamza el-Feir, who tried to smooth over the local friction.
On September 15 the camels arrived, and on the 16th we started for Mudowarrah with a force of 116 Bedouins, made up of Toweiha, Zuweida, Darausha, Dhumaniyah, Togatga and Zelebani Huweitat, and Ageilat Beni Atiyah. Sheikh Zaal was the only capable leader, and Audalds pretensions had made the other sub-tribes determined not to accept, his authority. This threw upon me a great deal of cletaiiecl work, for which I had no qualifications, and throughout the expedition I had more preoe-cupatiOn with questions of supply and transport, tribal pay, disputes, division of spoil, feuds, march order, and the like, than with the explosive work which should more properly have been mine. The Sherif with me, Nasir el-Harith, went blind the first day out and was useless.We reached Mudowarrah well on September 17, in the after-noon, after thirteen hours march and went down at dusk to the station about three miles further east. We got within 300 yards of it, but could find no position for a Stokes gun. The station is large and the garrison seemed to be between 200 and 300 men, and I was doubtful whether it would be wise to take it on with the rather mixed force I had ; so in the end I went back to the well and on the 18th moved southward into sandy country. It is hoped to make Mudowarrah the object of further operations.In the afternoon of September 18, I laid an electric mine, in about five hours work, over a culvert at kilo. 587, on the outside of a curve towards some low hills, 300 yards away, where Stokes and Lewis guns could be placed to rake the lengths of either north-or south-bound trains. The position was too high for the best machine-gun work, but the presence of a British machine-gunner made safety play advisable.We slept near the mine, but were seen by a Turkish watch-ing post near kilo. 590 in the afternoon, and at 9 a.m. on the 19th about forty men were sent from Haret Ammar ( = Kalaat el-Ah mar on map Maan 1: 500,000) to attack us from the south, Avhere the hills were broken and difficult to keep clear. We detached thirty men to check them, and waited till noon, when a force of about 100 men moved out from Mudowarrah and came slowly down the line, to outflank us on the north. At 1 pah. a train of two engines and two box-wagons came up slowly from the south, shooting hard at us from loopholes and positions on the carriage roofs. As it passed I exploded the mine under the second engine, hoping the first would then go through the culvert: the Lewis guns cleared the roof meanwhile. The mine derailed the front engine, smashing its cab and tender, destroyed the second engine altogether, and blew in the culvert. The first wagon upended into the whole and the succeeding ones were shaken up. The shock affected the Turks, and the Arabs promptly charged up to within twenty yards, and fired at the wagons, which were not armoured. The Turks got out on the far side, and took refuge in the hollow of the bank (about eleven feet high) and fired between the Avheels
at, us. Two Stokes bombs at once fell among them there, and turned them out towards some rough country 200 yards N.E. of the line. On their way there the Lewis gun killed all but about twenty of them, and the survivors threw away their rifles and fled towards Mudowarrah.   The action took ten minutes.The Arabs now plundered the train, while I fired a box of guncotton on the front engine and damaged it more extensively. 1 fear, however, that it is still capable of repair. The conditions were not helpful to good work, for there were many prisoners and women banging on to me, I had to keep the peace among the plunderers, and the Turks from the south opened fire on us at long range just as the train surrendered, our covering force on that side having come in to share the booty. The baggage in the train was&apos;very large and the Arabs went mad over it. In any case a Bedouin force no longer exists when plunder has been obtained, since each man only cares to get off home with it. I was therefore left with the two British N.C.O;&apos;s and Zaal and Howeimil of the Arabs, to ensure the safety of the guns and machine guns. It was impossible to complete the destruction of the first engine or burn the trucks. We destroyed twenty rounds of Stokes shells and some S.A.A. whose detonation kept back the Turks for a time. The north and south Turkish forces were both coming up fast, and our road back was commanded by hills which they were already occupying. I abandoned my own bag-gage and got away the men and guns to a safe position in the rear. Zaal was there able to collect-thirteen men, and at 3 p.m. we counter-attacked the hills and regained our Camping ground. We then managed to clear off most of the kit, though some of it, in the most exposed positions, had to be left. Sergeant Yells came up with a Lewis, and we retired ridge by ridge from 4&quot;30 pan. with no losses except four camels.The Turkish killed amounted to about seventy&apos; men, with about thirty wounded (of whom many died later). We took ninety prisoners, of whom five were Egyptian soldiers captured by the Turks near Hadiyah, ten were women, and nine were. Medina men, deported by7 the Turks. An Austrian Second Lieut., who (with about thirteen Sergeant instructors) was on the train, was killed : only sixty-eight of the prisoners were brought into Akaba.From 5 p.m. we rode hard northward, and on to Muclowar-rah well, at 8 pan. We watered that night, without interruption from the Turks, which was good fortune, for the station is only three miles away and the Arab camels were so loaded with booty as to be useless for a fight. We left the same evening, and got to Bum on the night of September 20.The promptness of the Turkish attack, the smallness of my force, and the amount of spoil made our retreat inevitable. I bad hoped to hold up the line for a considerable time, and still, hope that, with proper arrangements, it may be possible. The country about Mudowarrah (whose station well is, I feel sure, the key of
the Maan-Tebuk railway) is so bare of grazing, that the mainten-ance of a large blockading force is not feasible ; but the water difficulties for the Turks make a heavy attack by them, if Muclowarrah is once lost, improbable.The Arab casualties were one killed and four wounded.The mine was a sandbag of fifty pounds of blasting gelatine kneaded into one lump. It was set between the ends of two steel sleepers, in contact with each and with the base of the rail. Four inches of sand and ballast was laid over it. The spot chosen was over the south haunch of a three-metre arched culvert, and the contact wares were buried down the embankment, across a hollow, and up a low rocky ridge beyond. A naval waterproof detonator was used, as army detonators were not available. The burying of the contact wire took nearly four hours, since stiff single wires were supplied. A very light twin cable would be more use. It proved extremeh7 difficult (on the score of weight) to carry off the wires after use.The length of.cable available was 200 yards, but for reasons of observation I had to stand at 100 yards only. The shock of the explosion was very severe, and parts of cylinders, wheels, pnstons and boiler plating fell, all over the place to a radius of 800 yards from the locomotive. The whole side of the engine was blown off and half the culvert brought down. People in the trucks complained of shock. Had 1 fired the mine under the front engine I think both would have been wrecked. One was a Hejaz locomotive and one aD.H.P. (Damascus Aleppo Railway).LIBYA.Situation in Cyrenaica.The period, which has elapsed since the publication of the remarks in Bulletin No. 58 (p. 327), has permitted Libyan affairs to assume a clearer shape ; and contact, maintained with Idris by means of correspondence during the past few months, has served to clear up several obscure points of the political and military situation in his country.The outstanding event has undoubtedly been Idris&apos;s capture of the Turkish contingent at Gedabia, reported in Bulletin No. 61 (p. 363). The most important of his prisoners, including the redoubtable Musa Pasha el-Yemeni, have now been sent under escort to Kufra. This action on the part of Idris, being at variance with the conditions of Article 2 of our Agreement with him, whereby he has undertaken either to hand over all Turkish prisoners of Avar to us or to expel them from Africa altogether, has evoked a protest from the Italians who haAre asked that Idris should be compelled to observe strictly the above mentioned conditions.   An  official letter  has been   sent  from  Cairo  to
Idris, congratulating him on his exploit at Gedabia and asking him what steps he now proposes to take to observe the conditions of Article 2. Meanwhile Idris reports that there are several Turkish intriguers still at large in Cyrenaica. Having temporarily concluded his task at Gedabia, he came back east to deal with them, arriving at Akrama near Tobruk in the middle of September. He appears to entertain serious apprehensions about the powers of these intriguers, and his efforts to combat their propaganda, have undoubtedly been very seriously handicapped by a certain action on the part of the Italians.At thfe shortest notice an Italian &quot;Customs Post&quot; was established on August 23 at a well called M&apos;sead, four miles due west of Sollum, The local Bedouins at Sollum strongly resented this move and their resentment would undoubtedly have developed into active opposition, had not Kaled el-Homri, the wakil of Idris, happened to be on a visit to Sollum at the time. Strong representations were made to him that no armed Bedouins could be allowed to congregate on our borders, and eventually he sent orders, in Idris&apos;s name, to all Bedouins to disperse. Since then the situation has continued quiet. Iclris&apos;s personal views on this Post, as expressed in letters to the Italian Governor of Benghazi and to the High Commissioner, indicate very strong resentment indeed, and he refuses to accept the Italian explanation that the post was &quot;similar to others established by Idris himself west of Gedabia. He complains, that it is impossible to make his Bedouins believe that the establishment of this Post is necessary; furthermore, that its existence greatly strengthens the case made out against him by the above mentioned Turkish intriguers, who will now accuse him of having sold, his territory to the Italians. It is believed that a meeting was held at Akrama in mid-September between Idris and an Italian Diplomatic Agent to discuss the whole question, but it is not yet known whether any definite decision has been arrived at. [Later news says that the result was satisfactory]. Idris is known to be anxious to get back to Gedabia, where he has inaugurated certain military measures, including two patrol lines running from the coast in a southerly direction, the most westerly one from Marsa Sultan on the Sert coast to the5oasis of Sella some. 150 miles south. The Italians are urging him to ^permit them to attach a liaison officer to his entourage, and have requested him to submit a list of names. Idris has undertaken to link up some of his posts in western Cyrenaica with the Italians by telephone.That Idris is still nervous about the Turkish influence opposed to him is evident from appeals which he has made for money and assistance both to the Italians and ourselves ; the latter request was conveyed by a special delegate, who was recently interviewed by the High Commissioner. Idris complains especially of supplies reaching Misurata by submarine. The Italians have expressed their willingness- to assist Idris to combat the Turkish element, especially in the Gedabia district, which is his most
vulnerable point. It remains to be seen bow Far Idris will be able to counteract the insidious propaganda of the enemy in his midst, for there can be no doubt that Nuri&apos;s agents are busy enough amongst the tribes of north Cyrenaica. In this connection, it is instructive to note that the Abeidat tribe of this region has shown signs of restlessness and is refusing, it is said, to acknow-ledge fclris&apos; authority ; on the other hand, it is not clear whether the tribesmen are being encouraged in their attitude of semi-independence by Turkish propaganda-Further west, Ramadan Shitewi still sits at Misurata and &quot;acquires merit&quot; from submarine arrivals.. In the neighbourhood of Tripoli itself, a large Turco-Arab force, said to have been commanded by Nuri personally, with Sheikhs Sof and Suleiman Baruni in attendance, was recently reported to have been dispersed with heavy loss south of Zanzur, by an Italian column under General Cassinis. But later information tends to discount the first report of this affair.NOTES.Turks outside Medina.Miralai Abd el-Mejid Bey, now. at Yambo, forwarded to Colonel Wilson, in the middle of September, a chart of the Turkish dispositions round Medina. The chart had been drawn without knowledge of true relative distances or directions, and is, therefore, not worth reproduction; but the posts indicated on it and the strength and armaments, enumerated in a, note sent with it, may be recorded.The Turks, according to this information, were holding the hills round a sort of semi-circle, with flattened ends, from Bir el-Manjur, W. of the city, to the springs of el-Ayun on the S.E. (E. of Awali). This semi-circle leaves to the S. Bir Derwish, where Ali&apos;s H.Q. are, but includes Bir el-Mashi, which is faced from the south by Zeid&apos;s 11.Q. There are seven hill-posts in all. (1) S. of Sir el-Manjur, where is a fortified camp; (2) ./. Abyar Ali, S. of the fortified camp of Abyar Ali; here is 3/52nd Regt. (reserve); (3) ./. Umm Ruqba with a Q.F. Schneider 7&apos;5 gun jmcl two Q.F. Mantelli 8-7 guns ; (4) hill above Bir el-Hurad, facing Bir Derwish ; here is l/52ncl Regt. and a fortified camp ; (5) two points S.W. and S. of Bir el-Mashi, held respectively by 3/42nd Regt. and l/42nd Regt., whose fortified camp is at Bir el-Mashi ; (6) near Awali which, with (7) el-Ayun and the intervening space, are held by 2/42nd Regt. Avith camp at el-Ayun. Except at No. 3 the guns are ordinary mountain, about tweuty-one in all, with about twenty machine guns.   The
battalion strength is 700. These lines are entrenched and barricaded with felled trees and linked up by telephone and heliograph. The food allowance to the troops is 400-450 grammes flour and 180-200 grammes wheat per diem. On special days lean camel-meat is served out, while other camel-flesh is dried, pounded and canned. Only special riding-horses receive durra or barley ration. Boots and clothes are worn out, -and no rice, soap, sugar, semn or matches are to be had. The rT.C.0.&apos;s and men, however, are still paid in coin.Railway Demolition.The following interesting experience of the difficulties of effective railway demolition is contributed by Lieut.-Colonel S. F. Fewcombe, D.S.O.&quot;On July (3, Capt. Hornby and Aziz el-Hamawi cut 300 rails, north of Mabruk en-Naqa, on a straight piece of line. The line was inspected and most of the rails were found to be broken, pieces six inches long being knocked out of the top flange. Subsequently, however, an engine with several trucks passed over this broken tra,ck. Tbetrain rolled from side to side but no vehicle left the rails. Capt. Hornby saw it, and was unable to get the men with him to attack. Later on, both the fireman and the driver deserted. They stated that they had been punished by the Turks, who accused them of trying to damage the train by running over the broken rails. They were so angered by this injustice, when they had doae their best, that they deserted. Had the breaks been on the curve instead of on the straight, the train would certainly have been derailed. The fireman stated that, had the Arabs attacked, the train would have surrendered as there were only two or three armed men on it. As it was, they were able to run unmolested to Abu Taqa station. The driver was present when this line was repaired, and he said that only 218 rails were replaced. Damaged rails, slightly bent, were not touched ; and only those with the flange actually cut were removed. Also any pieces longer than five metres are always used again. Therefore, it is essential to cut at the centre of the rail.&quot; &apos;News of Anazeh Tribes.Two satisfactory signs of Nuri Shaalan&apos;s attitude towards the King of the Hejaz and ourselves have come to hand during the past week. One is an agreement, authoritatively reported, that, during 2Turi&apos;s absence from Jauf on business of the King&apos;s, a Sherifian artillery detachment shall guard the oasis against Rashidite attack. Ceylon mountain guns are asked for as the armament of the detachment. The other sign is a request from rJuri, transmitted through Major Lawrence, that half his tribe, the Ru wallah, should be allowed to supply itself, from some Mesopotamia!! market, controlled by us. He states that the usual supplies of Hauran corn have been headed off, presumably by the
Turks, from his tribesmen, owing to the latter showing their hand too soon.   Nuri&apos;s request has been referred to Baghdad.Bagdhad telegraphed on September 24, that a Muzeiri TJbidah sheikh, who had come down from near Meskineh, has reported his tribe, the Seba, to be moving south to avoid the Turks, who are oppressing all the Anazeh in revenge for the defection of the Ainarat under Fahad Hadhdhal. The sheiklds own sectional chief, Barjis ibn Hucleib, was coming clown, eastward of Anclerin towards Sukbneh en route for the Qaarah district west of Hit. As he will cross the tracks from Tadmur to Deir and Hit, he will be able to inform Fahad about the truth of recent reports of the use of Tadmur as a base by the Turks and of their project for passing large bodies of troops across from Horns to the Euphrates by that place. The Fedaan are stated by the sanie sheikh to be moving in. the same direction and for the same reason as the Seba. Under their new Paramount Chief, Mudhim ibn Turki, who, on attaining majority, has superseded the well known Hachim Muheid, the)&apos; propose to stay at present in the Shamiyah desert about Qaarah. Fahad Hadhdhal had reported their intention already to Baghdad, and presumably it was submitted, by the Fedaan to his approval; Hachim Muheid is said to have retired east of the Euphrates into the Belikh valley, where he is camping with no more than a tent or two.The relations, however, between Fahad and Nuri Shaajan are not yet adjusted, and will not be till the latter renounces publicly his pretension to be paramount over all the Anazeh, At present Nuri expresses a wish not to be beholden in any way to Fahad in the procuring of supplies for his Ruwallah from a Euphrates source, if, however, Fahad gathers to himself the alliance of the Fedaan and Seba, Nuri will probably see reason : and if the former chief helps us oil the Euphrates line and the latter helps King Hiisein, we ought to able to bring about some agreement.Yemen ami Aden News.Sheikh Mohammed Hassan of Mirab, who is one of the holiest Shafei chiefs in the Taiz district and southern Tihamah, has suffered a, set-back at the hands of the Turks, who are reported to have occupied Mirab and driven him to flight. Since, however, he is son-in-law of the powerful Sheikh of Udein and is opposed very unwillingly by Sunni. tribesmen, even if these arc Turcophil, we have probably not heard the last of him and he is still worth our support.The matter of the murder of Abu Ras seems to have been settled temporarily on the terms mentioned on page 384, the Dhu Mohammed and Dhu Husein envoys having agreed to consult their tribesmen and in an)&apos; case observe a truce till after the   Bairam  just   past.    The   majority   of   their  followers
went home from Nakhlan, via Yerhn. for the feast. The Imam is reported to have made once more public proclamation of his solidarity with the Turks.We have been supporting Abd el-Kadir, grandson of the Fadhli Sultan, by the despatch of. a warship to Shukrab on September 27, with fifty troops, against a reported Turkish design to abduct him. Our soldiers were welcomed by Abd el-Kadir on landing.Jerba Shammar.Baghdad telegraphed, on October 1, that Abdul Aziz ibn Ferhan, of the Jerba Shammar had entered the area of our occu-pation and been received by us. His brother, Feisal, has been to Mecca for the. Pilgrimage, and there declared his adherence to King Husein&apos;s cause. He has now left for Zeid&apos;s camp and will probably go on to Abdullah and home via, Teima.Abdul Aziz and Feisal are sons of the late Ferhan Pasha by his second wife, a Tayi woman. Asi, a son by the first wife (of A mud stock), was made by the Turks responsible chief of the Jerba Shammar in 1911, and presumably he retains that position. What influence these half-brothers of his, Abdul Aziz and Feisal, may wield with the tribe is not known to Cairo ; but it is worth noting that their connection, on the distaff side, with the Tayi  who range in north-west Mesopotamia and could interfere with the Baghdad railway west of Tell Halif might prove of value to us.The Jerba are the leading section of the northern Shammar, by far the strongest of the Mesopotamian nomad tribes. The Jerba Sheikh, whose nobility dates back to pre-Mohammedan times, is regarded as Paramount Chief of the whole tribe, about whose numbers great diversity of opinion prevails ; pro-bably at a pinch it could muster 8,000 fighting men. It ranges over all Eastern and Central Mesopotamia proper, from north of Mosul to the neighbourhood of Samarra, and across to Deir ez-Zor, with a sort, of. tribal metropolis at el-Hadr, west of Qalah Sherghat. It is, therefore, in a position to interfere with communications, not only on both the Tigris and Euphrates lines, but also on the cross-line by the Baghdad railway in the north. Some months ago, after a German engineer had been found murdered on the road between Qalah Sherghat and Tekrit, the G. O.C., Mosul, showed much solicitude about the attitude of the Jerba Sham mar and directed the despatch of presents to el-Hadr. Ferhan was out against the Turks all his life, as also was his brother, Faris, though eventually both accepted the title, Pasha. Even if some of Ferhan&apos;s sixteen surviving sons, like Asi and Humeidi, have accepted a mediatized position, the family tradition is to fight Turks.
