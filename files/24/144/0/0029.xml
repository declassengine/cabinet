APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT, No. LIV.Russia.THE news from Russia requires to be followed with care. Special notice should be taken of General A.rsenev&apos;s interview with Captain Smith. The news of disturbances at Vladikavkaz is somewhat disquieting, as it is a centre from which civil war might spread over the mountains into the Caucasus. The action of the Patriarch at Moscow may prove something of a landmark in the revolution. It is singular that the Bolsheviks had hitherto not taken active steps against the Church ; it must be remembered that the state, of Russia is in the peasant classes about on a par with that of Europe in the fourteenth century, and that though the leaders of the revolution are so advanced in political ideas as to look upon representative institutions as reactionary, yet the mass which follows is so far behind our age as to be susceptible to religious influences in a way we can hardly gauge. However, if the fourteenth century produced Lollards we ought not to be astonished if some similar communistic religious political movement did not appear in Russia and overthrow the existing forms of Orthodoxy.Poland.The telegrams do not tally with the press accounts of Polish action ; the situation is consequently still obscure.Greece.The coincidence of the mutinies in Greece with the passage of Greek officers through Bulgaria is to be noted.Arabia.The Arabs east of the Dead Sea continue to make satisfactory progress under Emir Feisal.Persia.The Governments attitude seems a little better.M. S.February 7, 1918.

On the 29th January Mr .Lindley transmitted [No. 273] a message from the mditary attache saying that Roumanian affairs would be dealt with by a special department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, which had been created for the special purpose. It had already decided that Roumanian officers in Russia should register themselves; they would be kept under close supervision but would not be arrested.In another telegram sent on the same date [No. 256] Mr. Lindley said that on the previous day the Roumanian minister had been ordered to leave with his staff within ten hours, it being notified that if they failed to leave they would all be arrested. The minister therefore left as ordered, and took with him all persons whom he was able to warn in time; he was crowded into a carriage with a number of sailors and soldiers, no proper railway accommodation having been provided for him.Mr. Lindley said [No. 273] that Badjar, a Roumanian socialist, endeavoured to persuade the Bolsheviks not only to refuse the minister a free pass from Russia but to arrest him.It was said, Mr. Lindley added, that it had been ascertained from secret documents which had been seized that Roumania had received money first from Austria and after-wards from Russia before entering into the war.The American Ambassador. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 30th January [No. 275] that the United States ambassador had been for some time the object of threats from Petrograd anarchists, On the previous day he had received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a communication enclosing for his information a copy of a resolution passed at a meeting of 500 persons on the subject of the imprisonment in the [898-81] B
United States of Emma Goldmann, A. Berkmann, and Thomas Mooney. The resolution requested the commissaries of the people to inform the United States ambassador that if no measures were taken to save the life of the above-mentioned individuals, a demonstration would be made before the United States embassy.The United States ambassador believed that Mooney was a United States citizen under sentence of death for some outrage. In the existing circumstances in Betrograd his execution might have very serious consequences for the ambassador; and, since the note covering the copy of the resolution made no mention of protection, it was fairly clear that the commissaries did not intend to afford it even if they could.On the 2nd February Mr. Lindley telegraphed again [No. 299] in regard to this matter. He said that the United States ambassador had sent Mr. Bobbins, of the American Bed Cross, to complain about this note, to Lenin, who was exceedingly angry with Saalkind and ordered him to apologise. The latter did not do so, but sent a secretary to say that the projected demonstration before the American embassy had been stopped owing to his efforts.The Heel Army. According to the &quot; Wireless Press &quot; the following decree of the council of the people&apos;s commissaries has been issued : The old army served as a tool for the class oppression by the bourgeoisie of the labouring masses. When power was seized by the working and exploited classes the necessity immediately arose for the creation of a new army which would protect the council&apos;s authority, and for the creation of a sure foundation in the work of transforming the standing army, in the near future, into a general arming of the people to serve in support of the coming social revolution in Europe.In this connection the council of the people&apos;s commissaries has determined upon the organisation of an army, to be called the workmen&apos;s and peasants&apos; red army, in accordance with the following principles : The workmen&apos;s and peasants&apos; red army will be formed from the most intelligent and organised elements of the working classes, in order to open its ranks to all citizens of the Bussian republic over 18 years of age. Everybody who is ready to give, his strength and his life in defence of the victories secured by the revolution of November, in defence of the counciLs authority and of socialism, is eligible for the red army.For acceptance into the ranks of the red army the recommendation is necessary of [ ? ] the military committees, or of public democratic organisations which accept the councifs authority, or of parties or professional organisations, or at least two members of such organisations.If whole detachments desire to enter the ranks then reciprocal caution is necessary and also individual voting.All ranks of the workmen&apos;s and peasants&apos; army will be lodged and boarded by the State, and thej&quot; will receive a monthly pay of 50 roubles.Invalid members of the families of the red army soldiers who have supported them will be provided with all necessaries in accordance with the local prices as sanctioned by the local institutions of the councils authority.The council of the people&apos;s commissaries is the supreme head of the workmen&apos;s and peasants&apos; army.The actual leading of the army is entrusted to the AU-Bussian &quot; collegium&quot; created under the war commissariat.This decree was signed by MM. Lenin and Krylenko, the former as &quot; president of the council of the peop!e&apos;s commissaries,&quot; the latter as &quot; highest commander-in-chief.&quot;Arrangement for Trade with Germany. Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 306] on the 2nd February that Bussia and Germany had come to an arrangement for the exchange of absolutely necessary products medicines for Bussia, rubber, leather, nickel, and platinum for Germany.Bolshevik Delegates to Allied Countries. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 29th January [No. 267] that it was officially reported in the press that M. Kamenoff, one of the Russian peace delegates to Brest, was leaving for Stockholm, London, and Paris, as a special delegate of the council of people&apos;s commissaries, with a view to informing the Governments and peoples of the allied countries as to the course of the peace negotiations. The communique further stated that only the suspension of train services on the Finnish railways prevented his departure.
On the 1st February Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 293] that he had given a visa to M. Kamenofis passport, and also to M. Saalkind&apos;s: both were proceeding to Switzerland I)    via England and France.   The latter was said to be going to organise a new inter-national bureau in Switzerland.German Activities in Russia. The following paragraph is taken from a despatch from the consul-general at Moscow, which was transmitted by Sir George Buchanan about a month ago : &quot; As you are aware, Germans and Austrians have been coming into Moscow for some time, and here they may be seen walking and driving in the streets in uniform ; the 30,000 German-Russian permanent residents are well organised, and a large number of them would undoubtedly put themselves at the disposal of any commissioned officers here. The chief places outside Moscow which are worthy of special attention [in regard to German activities] are: Krasnoyarsk1 (where nearly ali the prisoners taken from the German artillery are kept), Orenburg,2 Ufa,3 the Lower Volga Saratof/&apos; (Sarepta,5 Tsaritsyn,0 &amp;c), and Ekaterinburg7 (an internment camp for German civilians). It is to be regretted that we have no persons at those places able to report rapidly and secretly on such matters as the alleged formation of German detachments from prisoners in the Tsaritsyn district and the intrigues of enemy agents in the Bolshevik centre at Saratof, where, as I have told you .... the only journal published during the last period of civil, strife was in the German language.&quot;esthonia.Declaration of Independence [see E.R. LIU, p. 7]. Sir Esme Howard telegraphed from Stockholm on. the 30th January [No. 261] that the Swedish papers, had that day published the following resolutions adopted by the representatives of all Esthonian parties, except the Bolsheviks, assembled with the council of Lantdag on the 12th and 13th January :-1. Esthonia declares its independence as an internationally guaranteed neutral republic.2. This republic guarantees free trade policy to all Powers.3. Clauses shall be inserted in the peace treaties precluding Germany and Russia from erecting fortifications or repairing existing ones on the Osel, or elsewhere in Esthonian territory.4. Esthoiuan delegates shall participate in the peace congress.5. Questions regarding Esthonian independence or association with any other Power shall be finally decided by a plebiscite held under the supervision of a neutral state, say Sweden.All parties in Esthonia delare that the Esthonian people as a whole are opposed to the occupation of their country by German troops.Ukraine.The Rada. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 29th January [No. 270] that a communique had been published in the official press stating that the Left Social Revolutionary Party had received information from Kieff that the general secretariat of the Ukrainian Eada had resigned; the new secretariat would be formed of representatives of the Left Social Revolutionaries and the Bolsheviks. It further stated in connection with this that the present delegates at Brest from Ukraine would be replaced by others with the strictest orders not to act independently, but conjointly and in full accord with the general Russian peace delegation. Any obligations entered into by the central Rada at Kieff would be declared invalid both by the Ukrainian people and by the Ukrainian Sovyet authorities, who recognised the council of the people&apos;s commissioners as the organ of the All-Russian Sovyet Government, duly authorised to act in the name of the whole Russian federation.(!) In Eastern Siberia, capital of the Yeniseisk government.(*) Capital of the government of that name, in the extreme south-east of European Eussia. (8) Capital of the government of that name, north-west of and adjacent to Orenburg. (*) On the Volga, capital of the government of that name, more to the west than Ufa. (5) On the Volga, in the government of Saratov. (6) Also on the Volga, in the government of Saratov. v- In the government of Perm, to the east of the Ural Mountains.
Sir G. Barclay transmitted [No. 101] on the 1st February a telegram from the British agent at Kieff who said that since the fourth [? universal] had been passed a ministerial crisis had been in progress, though, so far, there had not been any resignations. It was probable that the Prime Minister, the Minister of War, and three others, all Social Democrats, would go and that they would probably be replaced by Left Social Revolutionaries. The Bolsheviks were gaining ground rapidly, and though Kieff was faithful to the Rada it stood practically alone.Odessa. The British consul telegraphed on the 31st January [No. 28] that Odessa had ceased to belong to the Ukraine republic ; on the 27th January without any fighting the Government offices, the post office, and the telegraphs had been seized by the Bolsheviks who were in command of the town, which was quiet.General Situation. Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 310] on the 2nd February that Captain Smith had had a conversation with General Evgeni Arsenev, who had returned from Kieff a couple of days previously he was one of the more brilliant of the younger officers of the imperial regime and had commanded the guards cavalry corps up to the outbreak of the revolution. General Arsenev, after saying that Ukraine was now practically Bolshevist, stated that the southern movement was neither pro-war nor pro-ally, and asked that the British Government should be informed that, as nothing could be expected from the south, further support thereof would be a tactical mistake which might lead to serious trouble with the Bolshevik authorities.The Caucasus.Disturbances in Cis-Oaucasia. Sir C. Marling telegraphed [No. 81] on the 3rd February that news of serious disturbances at Vladikavkas had been received by the Persian Government.Siberia.Semenov s Movement. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir J. Jordan [No. 64] on 4th February that the support of any purely Russian movement in Siberia, prepared to act energetically, was essential. Semenov apparently was prepared to so act; and, therefore, his adherents should be informed through the consular officer at Harbin that we were prepared to support his movement with money, arms, and ammunition.Sir J. Jordan had telegraphed [No. 94] on the 2nd February that the United States military attache, who had been to Irkutsk, had informed him that he considered Semenov, though active, energetic, and capable, too inexperienced for high command. He thought that at the back of Semenov&apos;s scheme was the idea of ejecting Chinese troops from the Chinese Eastern Railway.The military attache had also said that but few Bolsheviks were left in Irkutsk, and that Semenov would be able to capture and hold Chita without difficulty and without allied aid, on account of the demoralisation existing in the Trans-Baikal province.POLAND.General Situation.  Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 29th January [No. 257] that the Polish Council had informed him that their refugee organisation would have to be dissolved unless the allies could provide financial assistance. Telegraphing again on the following day [No. 277J, he said that a note had been addressed to him to the effect that the Bolsheviks were gaining great influence over soldiers discharged for age or illness; this was a consequence of the penury of the central civic committee. Attempts to form revolutionary battalions from the worst Polish elements were being made by the Bolshevists.ROUMANIA.Suspension of Postal and Telegraphic Communications. Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 31st January [No. 98] that he had been informed by the Post Office that all external telegraphic and postal communications had been suspended.GREECE.Traitor Officers. Lord Granville telegraphed on the 30th January [No. 99] that a certain number of Greek officers had passed through Bulgaria en route for Constanti-nople in order to take service against Greece. they were Tested at the military club in Sofia. This news had been confirmed by the Dutch legation and communicated by M. Yenizelos.
The Lamia Incident: Arrest of Prominent Men. Lord Granville telegraphed on the 4th February [No. 117] that M. Venizelos had issued a communique&apos; to the press explaining that the situation, as shown by the Lamia incident, demanded drastic and prompt action. The Government would remorselessly crush anything which tended to help the enemies of Greece; to criticism intended to help her to victory no objection would be raised.Skuludis, Lambros, Falocosta, several other ex-ministers, Prince Ypsilandi (late Master of the Horse), and the notorious deputy Coumondouros, eleven in all, had been arrested in Athens.TURKEY.Turkey, Germany, and Palestine. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed on the 31st January [No. 136] that he had learnt that a complaint had been made to the German ambassador in Constantinople by the Sublime Porte to the effect that a disastrous effect was being wrought in Turkish public opinion by the slowness of Germany in coming to the help of Turkey in Palestine. It was feared that there would be a military rising leading to the fall of the Government if Germany continued to delay. In reply Kuhlmann had promised that in the near future Germany would provide the help needed to drive the British from Palestine.; and further he guaranteed that if Palestine (with Jerusalem) was not returned to Turkey, Belgium should not be evacuated.An agent reports in the same connection that the German Emperor had sent a signed letter to Enver Basha promising that Turkey should soon be freed from the enemy, and that this letter was placarded in the streets of Constantinople.ABABIA. &quot; IHejaz.Message for King Hussein. On the 4th February Mr. Balfour sent [No. 163] the following message for transmission to the King of Hejaz : His Majesty&apos;s Government is profoundly touched at the readiness and frankness with which His Highness caused to be forwarded to the High Commissioner the messages of the Turkish commander in Syria to the Emir Feisal and to Giaffer Pasha. The action of His Highness is only typical of that openness and truth which have ever marked the intercourse between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of Hejaz. The Turkish policy is evidently to sow distrust between the Powers of the Entente and the Arabs, who, under the inspiring influence of His Highness, are making so signal an effort to regain their ancient liberty, by suggesting to the Arabs that the Entente Powers desire Arab territory, and to the Powers of the Entente that the Arabs can be turned from their purpose of self-liberation; but the words of intriguers cannot bring dissension between those whose minds are bent upon a single thought.His Majesty&apos;s Government along with its allies stands for the cause of the liberation of the oppressed nations and are determined to stand by the Arab peoples in their struggle for the reconstruction of an Arab world in which law shall once again replace Ottoman violence and unify the artificial rivalries promoted by Turkish officials. His Majesty&apos;s Government reaffirms its former pledges to His Highness in regard to the freeing of the Arab peoples. Libsration is the policy His Majesty&apos;s Government has pursued and intends to pursue with unswerving determination, by protecting such Arabs as are already liberated from the danger of reconquest, and assisting such Arabs as are still under the yoke of the oppressor to obtain their freedom.PERSIA.Demands of the New Cabinet. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 25th January and 3rd February [Nos. 62 and 80] that he had sent a note (embodying the formulae which had been approved) to the Persian Government, and had received a reply thereto from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Persian note began by stating that it had been resolved to organise a uniform force officered by neutrals, and to do this at once. The following points were then mentioned as the objects of the Persian Government: (1) Abrogation of the 1907 convention and the abolition of the effects of the 1911 ulti-matum; (2) payment of the whole surplus of customs revenues ; (3) revision of the customs tariff; (4) unconditional payment of past andfuture instalments of the moratorium; [898-81] &apos; C
(5) the handing over of the South Persian Rifles to the Persian Government; (6) assistance in the evacuation of Persia by foreign troops ; (7) the acceptance of the participation of Persian representatives in the peace conference.The Foreign Minister subsequently told Sir C. Marling that the Persian Govern-ment intended to negotiate on the basis of the latter&apos;s note and that he would call, for that purpose, at the British legation on the 4th February. Sir C. Marling gave him to understand that financial support would be continued just so long as the attitude of Persia was friendly.The Bolsheviks and the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907. Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 264] on the 29th January that the official press had published a communication from Trotsky to the Persian minister in Petrograd in regard to the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1907, in which it was stated that &quot;according to the principles of international policy confirmed on the 26fh October last by the second all-Russian congress of Sovyets, the council of the people&apos;s commissioners declared that the above-mentioned agreement, directed against the freedom and independence of the Persian people, was once for all annulled.&quot; It further stated that in the name of the Sovyet Government all agreements, previous or subsequent to the agreement in question, which in any way restricted the freedom or independence of the Persian people were invalid.In regard to acts of Russian troops, still in Persia, committed against the Persian people, Trotsky begged the minister to believe that such acts were contrary to the wishes of the Russian authorities, and due to the ignorance of the men or to the counter-revolutionary tendencies of their officers. In conclusion, it was stated that the Sovyet authorities would do all in their power to rid Persia of the agents&apos; of Tsarism and the bourgeoisie ; to punish any Russian citizen guilty of excesses committed at the expense of the Persian people ; to obtain the complete evacuation of Persia by the Turkish and British troops ; and to guarantee that Russo-Persian relations in future should be based only on the free agreement and mutual respect of the two peoples.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.RUSSIA.&quot; All Russian &quot; Congress of Sovyets. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on -the 3rd February [Nos. 319 and 321] giving the following summary of the resolutions passed by the third &quot;all Russian&quot; Congress of Sovyets on the 31st January, before closing its sittings : A resolution in respect of the rights of the proletariat declared that all authority belonged to the workmen&apos;s, soldiers, and peasants&apos; sovyets, and that the fundamental task of such authority was the destruction of every kind of exploitation of man by man and the establishment of socialism. The congress therefore apj)roved and confirmed the steps already taken by the sovyet Government in this direction with reference to the abolition of private ownership and the transfer to the State of all land, forests, mineral wealth, mines, factories, railways, &amp;c. The congress also approved and confirmed the laws respecting labour control; output ; repudiation of loans; transfer of banks and private property to the State ; introduction of universal liability to work, and the formation of a socialistic revolutionary army.A resolution respecting peace confirmed all statements made and all steps taken up to date by the sovyet Government to conclude a universal democratic peace, and declared that the attitude of Austria and Germany towards Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine, Livonia, and Esthonia was contrary to the principles affirmed by them in their declaration of the 25th December, 1917.Resolutions were also passed approving the home policy of the sovyet Govern -ment, and the policy regarding the self-determination of the nationalities hitherto forming part of Russia. The recognition of the independence of Finland, and the Government policy in regard to Persia and Turkish Armenia were also confirmed.Finally, the congress approved the proposed future constitution of Russia, n amely, either a socialist sovyet republic based on the voluntary federation of the peoples of Russia ; or a federation of sovyet republics of these peoples, the supreme organ of which should be an &quot;all Russian&quot; congress of sovyets summoned every
three mouths. An &quot; all Russian&quot; central executive committee would act as the supreme authority during the periods when this congress was not sitting.It was explained to the congress that this resolution was not to be regarded as law, but merely as indicative of the general basis of the future constitution of the Russian federal republic.The number of delegates who attended the opening sitting was about 700, but by the closing day there were over 1,000.Excommunication of the Bolsheviks. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 4th February [No. 331] that a few days previously the Bolsheviks had occupied the important monastery of Alexander Nevski in face of the opposition of the monks, one of whom was killed. They had since issued a decree confiscating all Church property and completely separating the Church from the State. The patriarch had replied by excommunicating the whole party ; which means that no professed Bolshevik can either communicate or be married in a church. This ban would have little effect on the town workman, but it was difficult to believe that it would be without influence in the country. It would probably make the Church the rallying point for all forces opposed to the Bolsheviks, and would give their movement a distinctly monarchical tendency. It remained to be seen what the attitude of the peasantry would be when they found that they were in the same camp as those classes whom they had been taught to consider enemies of the people.Appeal to German Strikers. The Admiralty Wireless Press has issued a long unsigned address to German strikers issued through the wireless stations of the Russian Government. The document is strongly worded: the following passage may serve as a sample : &quot; The civil war in Russia is approaching its end with the complete victory of the social revolution. In Finland it is standing before its victorious completion. In France we have already seen the first woxdvmen barricades. In Italy the growth of the workmen revolution is no longer a question of nights and days, but only of hours. Roumania is on the eve of revolution. In England the strike movement is extending. In Austria and Germany the sovyets of the workmen&apos;s delegates have at last been established. The &apos; red spectre&apos; of communism is showing itself throughout Europe. The hour of the socialist world revolution has come. We must now be ready to sacrifice everything for the sake of the victory of socialism.&quot;PERSIA.Proposals of the Persian Government. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 4th February [No. 88] that, as arranged, Mushaver-ul-Mamalek had called that day and submitted the Cabinet suggestion made with a view of meeting our wishes in regard to the South Persian Rifles. The suggestion was that, in return for that force being maintained (with the full recognition of the Persian Government) till the end of the war, all British troops now in Bersia should be withdrawn. The minister declared that, if we would agree to this, his Government would use every means to prevent enemy agents from entering or working in Persia.Sir C. Marling declined to express any opinion on the proposal as a whole, but he said (1) that he did not think that the removal of ordinary consular escorts would be agreed to, and (2) that the force guarding the oil-fields and the Afghan frontier cordon must unquestionably be maintained. He also pointed out that the Turkish frontier was open and asked what measures the Persian Government could take in regard to it.Mushaver-ul-Mamalek replied that consular guards were not in question, and that as the Afghan cordon was largely made up of local levies it might perhaps be treated as part of the South Persia Bifles ; as to the force guarding the oil-fields, he expressed no opinion. On the Turkish frontier, the Cossack division, he suggested, might be employed ; a proposal in which, Sir C. Marling said, some confidence might perhaps be felt so long as the Russian officers remained, but it was easy to conceive circumstances in which they would disappear.A German Officer at Enzeli. Sir C. Marling transmitted [No. 86], on 5th February, a message from the consul at Resht saying that, according to information received by him, some Russian officers &quot; and two Bolsheviks &quot; had arrived at Enzeli and then proceeded to Kasma accompanied by a German officer.   They came from Baku.o
