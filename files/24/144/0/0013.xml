SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT No. XXXVIII.Russia.THERE is nothing of political consequence to comment on in the official telegrams. The Finnish movements and the G-uLf of Riga operations should be noted.   A press telegram describes the internal anarchy prevailing in Eastern Russia in gloomy terms. It would be of great interest to ascertain what is going on in the Turanian areas of Russia. -Egypt.   (Ex-Khedive.)All advices go to show that the Ex-Khedive will be used, as anticipated, solely to confuse or foil the Arab movement.Armenia.A map, drawn up by His Excellency Boghos Nubar Pasha, is appended to this report. It gives the area referred to in His Excellency&apos;s memorandum issued with the last report.Africa for the Afreoan and Pan-Islam.Attention is drawn to the paper by Captain Phillips in the Appendix. It clearly demonstrates that if, after the war, the C.U.P. hold a dominant position, it will not want for an opportunity in stimulating unrest in many parts of Africa. At present the Arab movement tends to cut the Turanian activist from Africa, but if it should fail the Turks will have an easy road into a happy hunting ground.M. S.October 19, 1917..&apos; 898-651

Buchanan telegraphed on the 10th October [No. 1598] the following textual translation of those parts of the declaration of policy of the Provisional Government which dealt with questions of peace, foreign policy, and army : Firmly convinced that only the blessing of universal peace will enable our great land to develop her full creative forces, the Provisional Government will continue unceasingly to develop a foreign policy imbued with the democratic principles proclaimed by the Prussian revolution, which has made these principles a national heritage, and will strive towards the attainment of universal peace which shall preclude all future violence from any quarter.Acting in complete accord with its allies, the Provisional Government in the immediate future will participate in a conference of the allied Powers. Moreover, the Provisional Government will include among the representatives a delegate possessing the special confidence of democratic organisations.At this conference, parallel with the decision of military problems common to the allies, our representatives will endeavour to reach an agreement with them based on principles proclaimed by the Russian revolution.Striving for peace the Provisional Government, however, will devote all its strength in defence of the common cause of the allies, in defence of this country, in determined resistance to all attempts to wrest territories from other nations or enforce a foreign will on Russia, and in expulsion of enemy forces from the limits of our land.In the task of increasing the efficiency of the army, the Provisional Government will follow the only path which can give satisfactory results, the path of democratic principles already notified in the order of the supreme commander-in-chief announced by the Minister of War in the name of the Provisional Government. The selection of those to command whose professional efficiency will meet the demands of modern warfare, who at the same time are loyai republicans, and close co-operation between [898-65J B
officers and the army and navy organisations, both in the rear and at the front, will constitute in future as heretofore the base for reconstruction of army. These measures will re-establish the necessary military discipline without which a powerful army is impossible. A special law will be published precisely defining and giving due stability to the rights and duties of organisations in the army and in the navy. As an absolutely necessary step towards increasing efficiency in the army the Provisional Government will reduce the strength of the disproportionately large establishments at the rear and demobilise some categories of soldiers whose retention in the ranks at the present moment only constitutes an unnecessary burden on both army and exchequer and at same time is inflicting material loss on the internal economy of the nation.Oesel Island. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 13th October [No. 1619] that a German force had been landed in Oesel, the Bussian garrison of which was being reinforced. When asked what he thought of the naval situation so created, M. Tereschenko replied that it might become serious next spring, but the Russian Admiralty thought that this year the Germans would confine themselves to getting complete control over the Gulf of Riga and not try to take Reval.Internal Situation. On the 10th October Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 1600] that M. Konovaloff, Vice-President of the Council and Minister of Commerce, had spoken of the present Government as a real coalition, and had said that the Socialist members were anxious to co-operate loyally with their colleagues, and were no longer delegates of political organisations to which they were responsible. The Government was trying to extend the principle of the coalition with a view to organising all over Russia the different classes which it represented. Three days later he telegraphed again [No. 1619] saying that in a later conversation M. Konovaloff had admitted that anarchy was spreading in the interior, and that the Bolshevik influence was on the increase; he did not indicate any way of creating an armed force for the maintenance of order, though he spoke of its necessity.The Army. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 13th October [No. 1619] that in the course of conversation he had asked M. Tereschenko whether he really believed that Russia could carry on through the winter, and that the soldiers would not leave the trenches directly the cold began. He admitted that doubtless many would desert, but he thought that enough to hold the enemy would be left.Fix land. t.Munitions Supplied by Germany. Sir E. Howard telegraphed on the 15th October [No. 2996] that the papers stated that a motor-boat, seen to be loaded with ammunition, had been stopped off Holmsund, near Umea, by a Swedish Customs boat which had been forced to retire by the Finnish crew of the motor-boat, who threatened the Customs officials with revolvers. Armed vessels had been sent in pursuit of the motor-boat, but so far without success. It seemed certain that the Finns had a depot of weapons from which the boat in question (which left IJmea empty) had taken its cargo.Considerable thefts of weapons, mostly revolvers, were said to have taken place lately from North Swedish regiments, but it was thought that the main stock of the weapons in the depot probably came from  German submarines which were rumoured to have delivered stocks to Finnish boats out at sea.POLAND.Proposed Declaration by the Allies. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 11th October [No. 1608] that he had been asked by M. Tereschenko, in regard to the Polish (? national) feite which was to be celebrated in Petrograd on the 15th October, whether he and his colleagues would join in making a dec&apos;a ration (in the name of their Govern-ments) that a condition tor establishing an equitable and enduring peace in Europe was the creation of a free and indivisible Poland. In reply Mr. Balfour telegraphed on the 13th October [No. 2096j that there was one point which he left to Sir G. Buchanan&apos;s discretion, as there was no time to discuss phraseology, and that was the substitution of &quot; independent&quot; for &quot;indivisible;&quot; whilst agreeing to the proposed course, he should prefer this.
EGYPT.The New Sultan. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 11th October [No. 1069] that the Sultan&apos;s accession reception was progressing very satisfactorily: he had conveyed to His Highness the good wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and informed him that the King had conferred on him the G.C.B. He was much touched and very grateful, and begged that his deep appreciation and thanks might be conveyed to His Majesty.The Ex-Khedive. Information -has been received from an agent to the effect that it was at the suggestion of the German Emperor that the Ex-Khedive was iuvited to Constantinople. Some months ago, when there was a question of his going there, he had asked for a salary from the Turkish Government, guaranteed by the Governments of Austria and Germanv, and further that he should be received, not simply as Ex-Khedive, but as Viceroy. The object of the present move is that he should endeavour to win over King Hussein, of whom he was formerly a friend. If the King cannot .be won Over, then Abbas Hilmi will,be appointed &quot;Viceroy of Hejaz.&quot; Another agent reported that he had been informed by Germans and Young Turks that he would go from Constantinople to Damascus, where he would meet the German Field-Marshal. The same agent reported strained relations between the Germans and the C.U.P., and said that Abbas Hilmi had anything but a friendly feeling towards the latter.THE SENUSSI.Said Idrisi [See Eastern Report XXXVI, p. 5]. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 15th October [No. 1083] that he had &quot;received another urgent request from Said Idrisi that he should meet a British representative. This could not be, but Idrisi had been informed that Ali Pasha El Abdia would report the result of his conversations. The necessity of Idrisi coming to terms with the Italians had. been urged on Ali Pasha, as well as the necessity of his giving evidence of his good disposition towards them, and of his honesty ; and Sir R. Wingate was hopeful that this advice coming from a former avowed enemy of Italy would impress Idrisi, whose attitude to.,the Italians had improved very much since his visit to Cairo. Sir R. Wingate added that the forthcoming meeting might have good results and pave the way to closer co-operation if the Italians would, on their part, give proofs of their reliance on idrisis assurances and of their willingness to help him in his difficult situation.ARABIA.Aden.Sultan Makalla. Sir R, Wingate telegraphed [No. 1070] on the 12th October that he had received a telegram [No. 468 A.P.1 dated the 10th October from the Resident at Aden saying that Sultan Makalla was (apparently with some success) fighting the Kathiris. who had bribed the Hunshadi tribes into open acts of rebellion against the Sultan; he. was hard pressed and feared that his troubles would increase unless he was liberally assisted by us. He asked for a loan of 4 lakhs of rupees as well as for guns, rifles, and ammunition. The Resident considered that the main-tenance, during the war, of peace to the east and north-east- of Aden was largely due to the example and influence of the Sultan ; and he recommended that he should receive as a present certain munitions, and that he should be permitted to purchase others, fie also strongly recommended a loan of 4 lakhs, and that the interest thereon, if any, should be low. On the 15th October Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 980] to Sir R. Wingate approving a loan without interest and a grant of munitions.Yemen.The Confederacy. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir R. Wingate on the 15th October [No. 979] that the military proposals in his telegram [No. 1025] of the 1st October [Eastern Report XXXVI, p. 5] were being considered by the War Office. He also sanctioned the issue of 5,OO0L to friendly South Yemen shaykks who had fought the Turks or suffered for their pro-British inclinations ; and authorised the communication to Idrissi by Major Reilly of the terms quoted in Sir R. Wingate&apos;s telegram of the 23rd August [Eastern Report XXXI, p. 5j.
PERSIA.The Cabinet. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 14th October^ [No. 344] that the Cabinet had resigned on the previous day, and Mushir-ed-Dowleh had been invited to form a new Ministry.    It was thought that he would fail.British Relations with Persia.- The Viceroy telegraphed on the 13th October [No. 15440] some observations of the Indian Government on Sir C. Marling&apos;s telegram of the 4th October [Eastern Report XXXVII, p. 4]. The Indian Government agreed with Sir Charles that it was essential to obtain the friendship of the Persian Ministry, and in repaid to the suitability of Vossuk-ed-Dowleh he would, of course, be the best judge. The Indian Government also thought that it was of great importance that the fullest possible use should be made of the South Persian Rifles.South Persian Rifles. With reference to his telegram of the 23rd August [Eastern Report XXXI, p. 5] Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 12th October [No. 339] saying that the Persian Government had sent him a memorandum in reply to his enquiry as to what interim measures it had to propose. It was to the effect that the recognition of Southern Persian Rifles being even temporarily impossible the Persian Government had contemplated the formation of a single uniform force under officers from a neutral State. This was an easy matter requiring but little time for execution. The following s were given : 1. British officers and Indian (? commission) would be withdrawn at once, and the South Persian Rifles would be placed under the governor-general of (?Fars), His Highness being in command until the arrival of the neutral officers.2. The arms, &amp;c, of the old gendarmerie would be returned, and new arms would be purchased by the Persian Government.3. According to the Persian memorandum of the 30th July [Eastern Report XXVII, p. 8, telegram 272] the expenses of the proposed uniform force were to be paid out of the increased receipts derived from the modification of the Customs tariff. Pending that modification they would be paid out of the existing customs revenues, the service of Persian loans secured thereon being suspended meanwhile.4. Neutral officers would be engaged as soon as possible; pending their arrival special measures would be taken for the preservation of order in the south.5. Financial experts would be introduced as soon as the1 country whence they were to be engaged had been decided on.Sir C. Marling could not explain this reply, but he was inclined to believe that the Cabinefs object was to put on record such uncompromising proposals as would embarrass its successor. He proposed to inform the President of the Council verbally that he was informing Mr. Balfour of the contents of his memorandum, though personally he considered that, as his last proposals constituted rather a fresh demand of financial assistance than a serious suggestion to guarantee our legitimate interests, he feared they would not be well received.On the 16th October Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 339] his approval of Sir C. Marling&apos;s proposed action.Before the receipt of this telegram Mr. Balfour had telegraphed to Sir C. Marling [No. 272], in reply to his telegram of the 28th September [Eastern Report XXXVI, p. 5], in regard to the recognition of the South Persian Rifles. He was not to commit His Majesty&apos;s Government to any general change of policy, but subject to this he might at once open conversations.On the 13th October the Viceroy telegraphed a review of the situation as it appeared to the Indian Government. The creation, he said, of an expensive and highly organised mercenary army under British officers in South Persia was our present policy, and the force so created appeared to be extremely distasteful both to the Persian Government and the Persian people. It was, too, formed as a counterpoise to a similar Russian force in the north of Persia, and now presumably lacked its original justification. As a war measure the force promised no great value in the near future, and in certain contingencies might become a source of actual danger. Whilst the Indian Government recognised that the only hope for the permanent tranquillisation of South Persia lay in the presence of an efficient force under British officers, it doubted as to whether thatexplanation
tranquillisation was so urgently desirable as to warrant the development of an under-taking calculated to strain, at a critical time, our relations with Persia. The solution appeared to be some form of compromise which would render the force tolerable to-Persia; after the war the position could be recousidered.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.RUSSIA.Finland.Finland and Germany. Sir E. Howard telegraphed on the 16th October [No. 3007] that information hat! been received from what might be a reliable source that a communication had been made to the German Chancellor by the Finnish activists to the effect that if the Germans should come to Helsingfors and take Finland under their protection they would be welcomed. It was further proposed to offer the Aland Islands to Sweden.Munitions Supplied by Germany [see p. 2]. Sir E. Howard telegraphed on the 16th October [No. 3002 I saying that the motor-boat had been captured and the arms found on it were of the German army pattern.POLAND.Proposed Declaration [see p. 2]. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 15th October [No. 1627] that he had been obliged to accept the word &quot;indivisible,&quot; as both the French Ambassador and M. Tereschenko held strongly to it as a necessary mark of difference between the plans of the -allies for Poland and those of the Central Powers.TURKEY.Dr. Jemil. An agent reports that permission has been obtained from Constantinople for Dr. Jemil to visit Switzerland and that he would shortly arrive there; but no other Turks would, it was said, be so authorised until &quot; all troop movements had ended.&quot;[898-65]0
APPENDIX.&quot; Africa for the African &quot; and &quot; Pan-Islam.&quot; By Captain J. E. Phillips, of&quot; the Intelligence Department, E.A.E.F.Part I.1. During 191.6-17 there has been an unprecedented meeting of the tribes of Africa campaigning in &quot; German East.&quot; Natives of the West African Coast and the Cape have met those from Nyassa, East Congo, Somaliland, Zanzibar, and Uganda. As both intelligence and political officer in an area from Rhodesia to Abyssinia and the Congo to British East Africa, operating in German East Africa and speaking the languages, I have been happily situated for the observation of effects resulting from this meeting of the tribes.2. Round the camp fires there has been much talk in the lingtia franca which never fails the African starting from stomach and wife, and the distance which they themselves have been brought from home to hardship, and touching on the killing of white by black as illustrated before their eyes.True that the magnitude of a nebulous &quot;Empire&quot; is made known, but the increasing utilisation of black troops vice white is generally attributed to lack of the latter, and the subsequent doubtfulness of the result of the European struggle where white men are being decimated.     y3. Black privileges in the Cape and Sierra Leone are distorted into concessions wrung- from white by black.The &quot; liberal idea &quot; at bottom spells rape and loot to the negroid tribes.The Ethiopian Church in the Union and Nyassa, Nabinoi in Ruanda, Malaki in Uganda, and native: politics in Niamniam and Abyssinia, are strongly coloured by &quot; Africa for the African,&quot; with no conception, or desire to conceive, any intermediate process of construction of liberal principles under white tutelage. Thus for the first time in Eastern Africa has arisen a conscious feeling of the possibilities of a black Africa, as opposed to the dull sub-conscious resentment felt by the native when he may think pagan rites or polygamy are threatened, or he is taken for labour at long distances from his home. And what the native thinks is being done in this direction is invariably more dangerous than the actual action which gives rise to it.4. While not considering that the creation of a black army given the essentials of the best officers the cou try can provide, in permanence in Africa to be in itself a menace (as it was temporarily in the Belgian Congo) to white supremacy, yet a very real danger will be created in the existence by the villages of large numbers of trained men after tire completion of their period of service. Relative to this it must be borne in mind that there are concealed among natives in German East Africa- some thousands of comparatively modern rifles, mostly of the &apos;71 Mauser pattern, with large stocks of ammunition.For example, in the province of Ruanda alone, Captain Wintgens in 1914-15 armed 980 local levies, all of whom deserted en masse to their villages in June 1916 during the German retreat southward of their homes.Their rifles are not buried and deteriorating, but coticealed and preserved.Toe Wa-Tussi are a virile race numbering 2,000,000, unadministered by the Germans, quiet if not molested, but with an intense dislike of the white.5. It may be urged that the incoherence of native tribes in central and eastern Africa, outside the littoral, renders any general conflagration improbable. One should, however, beware of arguing, now or subsequently, on any pre-war promises, or relying on opinions not modified in accordance with the enormous upheaval of native thought brought about by the war in these parts. The case of Mopabi (Mopoii, who, in 1916, destroyed two French garrisons on the borders of the Belgian Congo and the French Sudan, and immediately set about organising the surrounding tribes under an Islamic guise, is a case in point.   The basis of his movement was anti-white.
I C7\ iI i i       iE ^LU
Part II.6. Accentuating this, a very real danger is to be apprehended from any conjunction of Islamic propaganda with the cry of &quot; Africa for the African.&quot; Islam would at once provide a cementing factor, and consequent fanaticism would enormously increase both the military and political difficulty in dealing with the movement. Converts are notoriously more fanatical than those born in the cult.Islam has a tendency in Eastern Africa to consider itself a political, as much as a spiritual force. Latterly Mohammedans have in this area tended to consider them-selves a Mohammedan nation. So much so that in enquiring the tribe of natives one is frequently&apos;met with the reply, &quot; I am a Mohammedan.&quot;It may be expected that after the war proselytising propaganda will be actively disseminated from Mecca (much as the Senussi have tried the peaceful penetration of Northern Nigeria), and though, should the King of Hejaz obtain the Caliphate through British influence, it may not be politically anti-British in tendency, it cannot in the nature of things be expected to assume anything but an anti-European character.7. The chief danger zone in this respect might be expected to be German East Africa, which is common ground for pan-Islam and pan-Africa. Descendants of Mahdists from the Sudan and slave-trading Arabs had, under German auspices, become recognised labour contractors for both Government and settlers.Natives educated in the excellent German secular schools have tended eventually to embrace Islam.The Arab-Swahili (i.e., educated) element in German East Africa is still sullen and generally prefers the German rule, though not so ill-advised as to admit it.The German pre-war policy was to enlist, by commercial fellowship, the sympathy of this element as a buffer State against native rebellion. When the latter ceased to be a real danger, their policy was to weaken Islamic political supremacy.Hence the Moschi papers. /In spite of their first willingness to make use of Islam, conversations which I have had with German-African administrators before the war showed clearly their apprehensions of what may be abbreviated into an &quot; African Jehad,&quot; viz., a conjunction of an African political Islam versus Europeans.A Turkish Jehad has not been, and never would be, popular in east or equatorial Africa, but an African Jehad is not an improbability and would meet with enthusiasm. The Mohammedan is the trading and travelling element. Propaganda travels quickly and unostentatiously by this means. Islam affords a freemasonry which is not hindered by custom, tribe, or dialect.During the war printed and written Islamic propaganda with green flags has frequently been intercepted by Uganda intelligence agents en route from German East Africa to the Sudan, Congo, and Darfur.Ex-Sultan Said Khalif of Zanzibar, recently captured, was a leading spirit.8. At present there is an opportune insulating belt of tribes, viz., the (a) Azande; (b) the Baganda&apos;; and (c) the tribes of British East Africa, between Northern Islam (Arabia and Sudan), and the Congo-German East Africa group.(a.) Islam has so far been able to make but little impression, spiritually or temporally, on the spirit-worshipping Azande-Monbuttu tribes to the north-west of Lake Albert.(6.) The Baganda are chiefly Christian, though markedly retrograde, owing to recent and rigid enforcement of monoyamy by the C.M.S.(c.) The tribes of British East Africa are primitive, incoherent, and pagan, though less likely to withstand any wave of Islamic feeling sweeping down from the north or up from the coast.9. The German Government in German East Africa maintained two native papers containing items of news from each station and district, compiled by natives for natives under white supervision, with legal articles explaining any native legislation, and giving general ideas of development of the country. The papers were published fortnightly and monthly. They had a wide circulation among all classes of literate natives and were a great assistance to the administration. They were much appreciated by natives, and much regretted when our administration refused to cany them on. The renewal of these papers would be a valuable measure in combating the movements in question, since the educated native conveys the ideas contained
to his illiterate friends, who are as eager as the Athenians to tell or hear some new thing. -10. Thus while Islam is best adapted as a native religion for equatorial. Africa, its political influences should be very closely watched, and a definite polrcy of encouraging strong and isolated tribal nationalism should be one of the most effectual barriers against a violent pan-African upheaval, which is, in this conjunction, a very real danger.Note I.-From the &quot; Weekly Times,&quot; the 20th April, 1917 :-German agents have been busily engaged in fostering pan-Islamic propaganda in the Dutch East Indies ; 400,000L has been spent by them in the Dutch islands, and contraband of war secretly introduced during 1917.Note II.

ARABIA.Hejaz.Intelligence.Attacks on the railway have been more frequent than usual, during the past fortnight, especially in the area of the 2nd Composite Force, i.e. between Maan and Muaclhdham. Some have been vigourously repulsed by the Turks, but the difficulties with which the latter have to contend are evidently increasing.On September 15, the Arabs attacked a Turkish detachment between &quot;Wadi Ethil and Dar el-Haj. The Turks were reinforced by cavalry and a. severe engagement took place, the Arabs being driven back with considerable loss. On the same clay some rails were destroyed&apos; south of Ram!eh, and on the following day at Muclawara ; in both cases the line was repaired without much delay. On the evening of the 16th the Arabs are reported to have cut the railway and the telegraph line between Tebuk and Wadi Ethil, but retired on the approach of a reinforcement train from Tebuk. On the 17th they destroyed some rails and small bridges between Akabat el-Hejazia and Bir el-Shecha&apos;. A bridge south of Mudawara was blown up while a train was passing over it, and a considerable number of Turks were killed or wounded ; troops were sent out both from Maan and Tebuk, but it is not known whether the bridge has been repaired.The Arabs are said to have attacked a party of the enemy who were cutting firewood in the neighbourhood of Wadi Ethil and to have captured most of them, including two officers. The question of fuel is one about which the Turks appear to be much concerned. Another is that of the water supply, ancl it is reported that brick walls are being built round the reservoirs along the line.In the southern, area, a party under the orders of Sherif Abdullah cut the railway and telegraph line between Bowat ancl Bir Nasif on September 15 ancl 16. After destroying a large number of rails, thev retired on the arrival of Turkish reinforce-ments, ancl an Egyptian soldier is said to have been killed. Sherif Abdullah reports that a force under Sherif Shakir defeated the Turks between Abu Naam and Istabl Antar, killing thirty-three and taking seventeen prisoners and a quantity of rifles, water-skins and blankets, and destroying six kilometres of railway. Sherif Sharraf is now. at Wejh, where he will probabty remain for the present.At Medina, all the Turks are said to be now inside the town. They have, however, seized all the dates in the neighbourhood, ancl also much property of the Harb tribe. The Harb tribesmen are consequently among the most active of those now serving in the Sheritian armies. There was some hard fighting round Medina early in August, the Arabs attacking from north and west.
Enemy&apos; aeroplanes dropped bombs at Akaba on. September 12, 15 and 17, and on the first occasion killed seven Arabs and wounded three.Sherif Feisal states that an enemy cavalry squadron attempted to reach Delagha but was driven back alder heavy fighting. It was reported from Akaba, on September 20, that three unsuccessful demonstrations had been made during the last few days by the enemy in the direction of \Va.di Musa. The Arabs claim to have killed 100 Turks, including a Commandant, and to have captured mules, camels and a, machine gun. An enemy force was said to be threatening Wadi Musa from Busa, five miles south of Petra, and mounted troops had left Akaba to oppose it. The Turkish aim, is to bar the way to the&apos; north and to retain both the valuable wood areas round Hishe, on which they rely to provide the fuel during the coming winter, and the Kerak grain district. They show no disposition to advance on Akaba at present.There has been a shortage of fodder in the Maan area, especially of barley, and the eneniy&apos;s horses are said to be weak through want of food. The inhabitants of Akaba who left it before its capture by the Arabs, and who Avent to Maan, are reported to be in a starving condition,Sherif Feisabs arrival at Akaba has eviclentlj7 created a great impression among the Arabs further north. A nephew of the Sheikh IJmjelli (Mujali) arrived at Akaba on SejDtember S from Kerak and informed Sherif Feisal that the Kerak district is awaiting his orders and the arrival of a Sherif to rise against the Turks. The Arabs of the Bir Saba district are also showing a disposition to co-operate with us, but they, too, insist on the presence of a Sherif, and Sherif Feisal has detailed Sherif Abdullah ibn Hamza for this purpose.Palestine.The Jewish Colonies.It is a departure from precedent to admit party controversj-&apos; to the Bulletin, but the following memorandum by one of the leaders of the Jewish movement, dealing with the criticism that the Jewish penetration, of Palestine is to the detriment of the native population, is perhaps of sufficient interest to warrant an exception. No responsibility is, of course, taken for the accuracy of its contents or for the views expressed.Purchases of Land by Jews in Palestine.&quot;Owing to the official and secret restrictions imposed by the Turkish Government, issued in order to hinder (lie purchase of land by Jews in Palestine, and owing to the intricacies of the Turkish law concerning the transfer of property &quot;in general, it, takes a long time, and endless trouble and expenses, to carry out such deals and to obtain a deed.
For these reasons, and also for reasons of policy, it did not pay the Jews to purchase small lots, -belonging to farmers. We preferred to buy large properties (&quot; Latifundia &quot;) held by Syrian bankers, landowners and other Palestinian euphemisms for usurers, suckers of the blood of the fellah. To this policy we have stuck with but very rare exceptions, if any.. , The tillers of the land were not owners, but workers on lease. Owing to the peculiarities of the Turkish law, under which ten years of uninterrupted occupation developes into squatter ownership, these had to be removed from the property when it changed hands. This necessity of frequently displacing the land-tillers is regularly practised by all Syrian landowners, such as the Sursok family.It is very likely this removal, always unpleasant, sometimes even, forcible, of the fellah in from the land they used to work but never owned, that has given rise to the wholly unfounded calumny that the Jews drive out the poor landowner without paying him his due.   (See Note at end.)Jewish Segregatioii.The Jews have been reproached for their exclusiveness and for keeping the Arabs out of their villages. It is true that we have strictly avoided Arab infiltration in our villages, and we are glad of it. From national, cultural, educational, technical and mere hygienic points of view this policy has had to be strictly adhered to ; otherwise the whole Jewish Renaissance movement would fail.Had we permitted the squalid, superstitious, ignorant fellahin, hard pressed by their Syrian brethren, the usurers, to live in close contact with the Jewish pioneers, still feeling their way and seeking the trail which might lead to. their salvation, the slender chances of success which, at their start, was all. that the Jewish settlements seemed to possess, would have been impaired, since we had no power, under the cruel Turkish administration, to enforce progressive methods, or even to ensure respect for private property.In the few cases where we failed to stick strictly to this policy, we met with failure from the Jewish national point of view. In Rosh Pinah (Arabic: Ja&apos;uneh), for example, the Jews and Arabs live, not indeed together, but close to one another. This continual contact may have brought about fairly friendly feelings between the two races, but at the cost of the material, moral and mental development of the Jewish settlement.Notwithstanding the great variety and fertility of their land, the Jewish farmers of Rosh Pinah are the poorest and the most unprogressive among our Jewish settlers. They remained on the same footing as their fellahin neighbours.
Yet from the educational point of view, Rosh Pinah had more chances, for twenty-five years consecutively, than any other Jewish settlement. The most remarkable Hebrew pedagogue in existence, a real Jewish Pestalozzi, a forerunner of Montessori, began his career in Rosh Pinah and practised there for years. His immediate successor is the next best known Hebrew teacher. For a quarter of a century the pedagogic methods of the schools of Rosh Pinah have been copied as worthy models. Yet, whereas all over Palestine, in the segregated Jewish villages and town-quarters, these methods yielded the most gratifying results, they nowhere produced such poor effects as in. Rosh Pinah, owing to the unavoidably degrading effect that continual contact with the uneducated fellahin had on the Jewish youth. In other places, although the two races were kept apart, there was no deep ill-feeling between Jews and Arabs, and the former have never wished to keep the latter clown. So far as the conditions of the Jewish schools permitted all these schools are supported by private, inadequate donations &apos; Arab boys have been admitted to free tuition.Jewish versus Arab labour.From the beginning of the Jewish colonization work thousands of Arab labourers earned their bread on Jewish land. The Turkish oppression Avas so hard that numerous small farmers or owners.of olive orchards abandoned their property and pre-ferred to work on daily pay in the Jewish villages, which escaped both the Turkish taxation and the Syrian usurer. This was specially so in Judaea and Samaria, where the intensive agri-cultural methods, developed by the Jews, the creation of numerous vineyards and orange groves, etc., required thousands of hands. The village of Petah Tikwah employed from one to two thousand Arab workers daily, according to season mostly Araishi from El Arish.The Turkish military drafts, the railway and other public enterprises, and the general development of the country made labour scarcer and dearer, and this improved the openings for Jewish skilled labourers of a higher standard of life. They were, however, preferably used as foremen, supervisors, etc.Since about ten years, however, we have had in Palestine an. artifically bred &quot;labour problem&quot;, as we have more or less artificial class fights and problems.With the failure of the Russian revolution, after 1905, the influx of Jewish immigrants brought along quite a number of those Russian disorganizing elements of whom we hear so much now would-be anarchists, maximalists, etc., who tried to implant in Palestine, in the Jewish milieu, all their bankrupt ideas and foolish dreams, without taking into account thai;, whether justified or not in Russia, where they originated, these dreams were entirely out of place, and, in fact, positively disastrous, as applied by them in Palestine.
Starting from the most generous premises, they tried to inaugurate the wildest agrarian reforms. The)7 wanted the nationalization of the land, the grant to every individual of no more land than he could till with his own hands, the abolition of all capitalistic concerns and of the so-called exploitation of the Arabs ; and to that end, however paradoxical it may sound, the interdiction of any other than Jewish labour on Jewish land, if we were to assert our national rights ancl national independence.These demagogic ideas could find but little sympathy in the propertied bourgeois classes. Still, a few enterprises on which these ideas were to be put into practice in the most orthodox fashion did spring up. It was in the nature of things that such enterprises should go in for extensive agriculture only, growing cereals and the like, under which relatively large areas can or must be cultivated by few hands ; for that reason they were, with one or two exceptions, established in Lower Galilee. It is not surprising that these attempts should have turned out utter failures.Still, a good deal was spoken, agitated, ancl printed about these fanatical adventures. They unquestionably did lots of harm, but only to the Jews themselves. Not one single Arab less was employed on Jewish property ; not one single Arab workman suffered loss by reason of them. But the Jewish work suffered greatly in its development. Would be investors were discouraged ancl their confidence shattered by the acts of sabotage of the fanatics, the more so that in our villages we could not possibly call on the corrupt Turkish authorities to maintain law and order. We had to rely on our self-imposed institutions and regulations, which, these disturbing elements sometimes, disregarded.The whole opposition of Jewish labour to Arab labour amounts then to this : a handful of fanatical talkers trying to &quot;protect&quot; the poor Arabs from &quot; capitalistic exploitation&quot; and, in order to do it, generously forbidding them to work at all:Attitude of the Jeics toicards the Arab Revolt.The Palestinian Jews have good reasons to hate the Turk and to help to rid the country of him. They have no interest, ancl still less confidence, in the Arab revolt . They are not in a position to take up arms against the Turk, and they would hesitate to join the Arabs, even if they were in a position to do it. So far as we know the Arabs, the man among them who will withstand a bribe is still to be born. According to their own proverb: &quot; Fifty prophets would turn liars, before a Bedouin would speak the truth.&quot; Lack of idealism among the leaders, lack of real public opinion among the uneducated masses and, above all, Moslem solidarity, will always cause the Palestinian Jews to keep a neutral attitude in this fight between Turks and Arabs. In order to help to defeat the Turk they will readily join the British forces^ but it is doubtful whether they will ever trust the Arabs.
But although we cannot promise our confidence and assistance to the Arabs in their striving for their national deliverance, we at least make no opposition to the success of their efforts, and abstention from active co-operation should not be taken advantage of by them to encourage, or placidly allow, attacks on Jewish property and life for mere reasons of jealousy and lust for robbery. Such attacks would hardly serve the Arab cause. International Jewry may still be too loosely organized to fight for the Jewish regeneration in Palestine ; but it will alwaj^s be found strongly organized when it comes to defeat the common foe. And the Arab leaders are too wise not to understand that, as well as the sympathies of Great Britain and France, the good-will of international Jewry is still necessary in order to bring about the realization of the Arab aims, national and financial.&quot;Note. The above memorandum has been submitted to another Zionist leader of equal authority, who takes exception to the implication on p. 389 that, Jewish purchasers sometimes find it necessary to expel the dwellers on lands acquired. He states :-&quot;Never in the history of Jewish colonization have Arabs been expelled from their villages. In the first place, the greater part of the lands acquired for colonizing purposes are lands hitherto uncultivated and uninhabited because of either their swampy or unhealthy character, or their reputed lack of fertility. Secondly, the Jews are not exposed to the danger of their claims being &apos; jumpedV by Arab cultivators, since they become resident proprietors of the lands held by them and, by pajung the taxes themselves, defeat the possibility of any such occurrence. The large Arab&quot;proprietors, on the other hand, being absentees and in the hands of incompetent or dishonest agents, are sometimes obliged to take the step described.&quot;ABYSSINIA.The Overthrow of Lij Yctsit.During the fortnight preceding the defeat of Lij Yasu (recorded on p. 376), the news which reached Adis Abeba from the north all tended to show that he was extending his influence in the Wollo and Edju districts. Communication between Dessie and Worm Hailu was cut off, the population having risen against the Government. An urgent demand for reinforcements, however, came through from Fitaurari Hapta Giorgis to the capital, and on August 26 the Government ordered that every man who had a rifle was to be ready to march in eight days&apos; time, while instructions were sent to Harrar to send tiji 8,000 men without delay, and to Dejaz Balcha (see p. 259) to come at once to Adis Abeba from Sidamu with his army.
Meanwhile the attitude of Tigre was doubtful, the Danakils were reported to be concentrating below Ankober, and considerable doubt was felt about the intentions of Negus Waldo- Giorgis, who had sent a force of 7,000 men towards Wollo. In Adis Abeba armed bands were attacking and robbing the shops by night, and the German Minister called a meeting of his adherents arid, after warning them that important events were pending, instructed them hi this case to go to the Legation, where arms and food would be provided.On the 28th the anxiety prevailing in the capital was suddenly dispelled by the news that on the previous day Lij -Yasu had attacked the Fitaurari in the neighbourhood of Dessie and had been defeated with tremendous loss. Ras liner was killed, Fitaurari Scrabezu seriously wounded and a prisoner, and the Wollo army practically destroyed. The loss on both sides is estimated at about 18,000 men, and little quarter seenis to have been given. Nothing has since been heard of Lij Yasu, who has probably escaped to the low country.It is now known that Negus Waldo Giorgis&apos; force under lias Imam, wdiose movements had caused the Government much anxiety, succeeded in making their waj&apos; through Edju and last and joined the -Fitaurari some days before the battle, contributing largely to his success.NOTES.Nawwaf Shaalun. \Strong letters have recently been sent by Sherif Feisal to Nawwaf, asking him to define clearly his attitude towards the Sherifian movement, and also to negotiate for the purchase of camels, the shortage of which is becoming serious. It is now reported that he has lately fled from Damascus owing to the Turks having hanged Mohammed Milhem, a big Sheikh of the Hasaneh section of the Anazeh, in spite of their promise to Nawwaf to pardon him. This may have an important effect on the attitude of the Shaalan family towards the Turks. Nuri Shaalan is in the neighbourhood of Jebel Druz.The Bent Sakhr.Fawwaz el-Faiz died last month. He had gone to Amman at the invitation of Jemal, and it is generally believed that he was there poisoned by the Turks, on account of his pro-Sherif leanings, by poison given in a, cup of coffee. This has caused great resentment among the Beni Sakhr, who attacked a Turkish post at Madeba, killing two officers and some soldiers. Fawwaz is succeeded by his son Mesh-hur, aged 25, who is strongly pro-Sherif, and has sent a message that his tribe are aAvaiting the signal to rise against the Turks. The)&apos; are said to be web supplied with arms and ammunition, and- are at present -on good terms with Nuri ShaalaiVs tribe, the Ruwallab.
- 394 - V *Conditions in Turkey.Emir Abdul Kadir el-Jezeiri, whose arrival at Sherif Feisal&apos;s camp was reported in the last Bulletin, reports that the internal conditions of Asia Minor and Syria are exceedingly bad,1 and that no public security exists. The country is filled with bands of deserters and it is everywhere unsafe to travel ; even the gendarmerie can only move in. parties of five or six.Talaat and Jemal are reported to have formed an alliance against Enver, whom they accuse of having sold Turkey to the Germans. Talaat has refused to take extreme measures against the numerous deserters.The Abd el-Kadir Family.When Turkey entered the Avar, the Abd el-lvader family were suspected of intriguing in the Arab nationalist cause, and one of them, Omar, Avas hanged. With the exception of Emir Abd el-Malik, who still heads the anti-French malcontents in Morocco, they Avere deported to Brusa, where they now live in honourable confinement. Abd el-Kadir el-Jezeiri, who escaped from Brusa and travelled secretly through Asia, Minor and Syria, has uoav offered the allegiance of the family to Sherif Feisal.Libya.. . i&apos; ,It is reported that enemy submarines arrive regularly atMisurata, where they discharge cargoes of munitions, guns, wireless apparatus, etc., and large sums of money. The pro-Turkish elements are thus greatly encouraged and the position of Seyyid Mohammed Idris is rendered precarious.Somaliland.The German armourer who has been with the Mullah is reported to have died Avhile attempting to reach the coast. This raaifs name was probably Emil Kirsch, and he went to the Mullah last year from Abyssinia with the assistance of Lij Yasu. Being treated as a prisoner in the Mullah&apos;s hands at Tale, he appears to have escaped one night about the middle of June accompanied by his servant. His strength gave out after some days, and it is thottght impossible that he can have survived. His servant left him and has been picked up near Musha Halid in an emaciated condition.
