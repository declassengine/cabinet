SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT, No. XXX.Enemy Propaganda.AFTER a long period of quiescence the clean-fighting Turk once more appears in the British Press. The article in the &quot;Daily News&quot; is certainly inspired, and, unknown to the editorial staff, is probably paid for by the C.U.P. Such propaganda should certainly be put down with a strong hand.This article is a brilliant piece of special pleading, and is by far too clever to allow of any doubt as to its purpose. General Townshend is used to cover the deaths of hundreds of officers and men ; the fact that German priests are allowed to say mass in the church at Bethlehem is used to cover massacres too revolting for the Germans themselves ; and, by a clever twisting of words, the Jewish deportations at Jaffa are concealed by denying massacres of which the Turks have never been accused.It is suggested that it might be useful if the editor of the &quot; Daily News &quot; were shown in confidence some of the evidence we have of Turkish misdeeds.M. S.Russia.Mr. Balfours telegram (No. 1709, the 16th August), making it clear that there is no intention of our weakening in our efforts to assist Russia in the matter of heavy guns and war material, is important and should do much to remove the fear that existed in the minds of some of the war party in Russia that we were not fulfilling our promises in these matters.The report regarding the condition of the Murman railway is most satisfactory; but the problem of the winter food supply of Petrograd and the northern towns will be very grave.Hejaz.Mustafa Cherchali&apos;s doings and sayings at Mecca are merely what were anticipated under the circumstances, and failing a definite agreement between ourselves and the French regarding concessionary rights in the Hejaz, such activities are bound to obtain.Yemen.The telegrams regarding the Idrisi and the Imam Yahya are significant. The Government of India has always clung to the hope that the Imam Yahya would come out on top and on our side, although he has consistently played the Turkish game for three years. It looks now as if the -sooner we. can get another Hashimite leader to replace Yahya in the Imamate the better for us and the better for the Arab movement. [898-57]
Syria.If it be true that one of Nuri Shaalan&apos;s sons has been caught and hanged in Damascus, arid if that son be Nawaf, the Turks have succeeded in removing one of their most powerful enemies. Nawaf has had more influence lately than his father with the great Roalla confederation of the southern Anazeh, whose headquarters have been at Jof. Such an execution can but tend to widen the breach between Arab and Turk. It has the justification that Nawaf is an open ally of King Hussein, whereas most of Jemal Pasha&apos;s cowardly and barbarous crimes have had nothing but the Turkish love of terrorism and tyranny to support them.W. 0.-G.August 24, 1917.

Since Turkey&apos;s entry into war until his departure in June he was the semi-official custodian of the holy places.&quot; I am glad to have an opportunity,&quot; he said, &quot; of reassuring the Christian world about the holy places. When I left Palestine they were not only unharmed, but were actually under the jealous and respectful guardianship of Turkish troops. Jerusalem, Nazareth, and Bethlehem, except for the large garrisons which they shelter, are just as they were in the days of pilgrims and tourists, and such historic and favourite spots as the Mount of Olives, which I visited before leaving Jerusalem, are unharmed and unchanged.   The same may be said of all parts of the Holy Land.&quot; Last Christmas, for instance, I went to Bethlehem and attended the Nativity Mass, celebrated, according to the Latin rite, in the church erected on the spot where, according to the tradition, Christ was born. The ceremony was perhaps more impressive than at Christmases before the war.&quot;Throughout the war the utmost courtesy and consideration were shown me. The British colony at Jerusalem, never very large, had, when I left early in June, dwindled.:898 571 B
down to three ladies.. One of these ladies, Miss Macalister, has a school for blind Arab children, and the other two have the missionary and religious spirit equally developed, only displayed in other directions. All are held in the highest.respect by the Turks. They refused to leave. &apos; If I were badly treated,&apos; said Miss Macalister, I could not leave my blind children, but as I am so well treated there is no temptation for me to go.&apos; I left these splendid women with regret. British property throughout Palestine has been scrupulously respected. The seals I placed upon the doors of houses belonging Mj to British subjects in Jerusalem early in the war were there untouched when I left.&quot; I spent nearly two months in Constantinople after leaving Jerusalem. There is suffering and disease, but the accounts which circulate abroad about conditions in Turkey are grossly exaggerated.&quot; One day whilst lounging near the landing stage on the island of Prinkipo I saw a tall striking-looking man disembark among the people who had arrived from Constan-tinople. He was extremely well dressed, looked full of life and vitality, and as he walked jauntily twirled a walking cane. All the Turks whom he passed saluted him with profound respect, and he returned their salutes punctiliously. &apos; Who is that man?&apos; I said to a Turk standing at my side. Tie looked at me in surprise. &apos; You&apos;re evidently a stranger here,&apos; he replied. &apos; Why, that is the great General Townshend.&apos; &apos; You evidently treat him with the regard due to his position ?&apos; I said. &apos; The Turk respects a gallant enemy,&apos; he replied.&quot; General Townshend is treated as a guest rather than a prisoner. I walked up and saw the beautiful cottage, overlooking the sea, in which he lives. The lawn was green, and there were bowers of roses, white and red, in abundance, in his garden. He has been elected an honorary member of the best clubs.&quot; Have you any information about the so-called massacres of Jews by the Turks ? &quot; I asked Mr. Glazebrook in conclusion.&quot; No such massacres occurred,&quot; he replied with emphasis.^   RUSSIA.The Stockholm Conference. Sir . G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 15th August [No. 1258] saying that the Prime Minister had that morning begged him and his two colleagues to urge their respective Governments not to refuse passports to their Socialists.Telegraphing again on the 15th August [No. 1257], he said that the Russian Government had that day published a statement to the following effect: The Russian Government considers that the settlement of questions of war and peace belong exclusively to it in accord with the allied Governments, supported by the allied democracies.   The Socialist conference at Stockholm is, as the Russian Govern-ment has several times said, a conference of definitei political parties, and, as such, it, cannot aspire to settle questions of State.The Russian Government had never thought of refusing passports to Russian Socialists, considering an international Socialist deliberation on questions of war and peace useful; and both the Premier and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have, on behalf of the Russian Government, informed the allied Governments that they would place no obstacle in the way of Socialist organisations taking part in the conference. Nevertheless, without denying the general political importance of the Socialist conference for the -examination of fundamental questions created by the war, the Russian Government cannot recognise that such a conference can take a decision which is the sole prerogative of the allied Governments.Moscow Conference. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 17th August [No. 1276] that owing to the change of Prime Minister the Moscow conference &quot;had been put off till the 25th August. This would be the first time since the revolution that anything like a representative gathering would have met, and the Government attached importance to it. The four dumas, zemstvos, Soviets, municipalities, peasants&apos; councils, industrial employers, merchants, landowners, troops at the front, and numerous societies would . take part in it, the number of delegates being some 1,700. The principal object of the Government would be to use the conference to prepare the country for a winter campaign, but the question of the Constituent Assembly would also be- discussed. M. Tereschenko had told Sir G. Buchanan that the Prime Minister would open the meeting with a general exposition of the situation.The Army. Sir G. Buchanan on the 17th August transmitted [No. 1271] a telegram from the military attache,.who   said that General Korniloff was satisfieds
that he would get his way in the end. The Commaiider-in-Chief also said that, orders had been prepared for the re-establishment of saluting in the army, and for the restoration of some of the disciplinary powers to officers, ancl that he hoped that sufficient discipline would be established by the autumn to retain the men in the trenches during the winter, and that the army would be fit for work by the spring. He said, too, that the Government had agreed to withdraw the sailors from Cronstadt, and to reduce that place from its position as a fortress.Evacuation of Riga. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 17th August [No. 1273] that he had been informed by M. Tereschenko that at present the measures taken for the evacuation of Riga were only precautionary, but it looked as if the Germans would attack they had sent three new divisions to the front. The fall of Riga, though he (M. Tereschenko) should regret it, would make it easier to include Petrograd in the zone of the armies, so that disciplinary measures could be taken. Sir G. Buchanan added that there was but little doubt as to the Germans being able to take the place when they liked, and they would probably prefer to winter in Riga than to remain in the cold outside.Military Supplies from England. On the 16th August Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan. [No. 1709] with reference to the latter&apos;s telegram of the 11th August [Eastern Report XXIX,p. 2 j, and instructed him to express most strongly that His Majesty&apos;s Government earnestly desired to assist Russia to the utmost of its power, and was not trying to escape from its obligations in the matter of heavy guns. Every heavy gun on which hands could be laid was needed for the western offensive, which was the heaviest the British army had so far undertaken, and which was now attaining its maximum intensity ; in order that the strain on Russia might be relieved, the Russian Government had repeatedly asked us to make this ojfensive as vigorous as possible, and Roumania had made a similar appeal. In. spite of the fact that guns shipped to Russia now could not be made use of for months to come, orders had been given to resume the despatch of heavy guns in order to remove the impression that we were weakening in our intention to assist Russia.Finland.General Strike. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 17th August [No. 1274] that a general strike had been declared in Finland on the 1 3th August except on railways. The strike was a protest against the brutality (groups omitted) action of Russian Government in dissolving the Diet. The Senate had resigned. M. Tereschenko had stated that the Government had decided not to give way. Cavalry had already been sent to Finland, and if necessary a state of siege would be declared ancl the whole administration placed in the hands of the Governor-General.ROUMANIA.Russian Provision-for Evacuation. Sir George Buchanan telegraphed on the 13th August [No. 1246] that M. Tereschenko had informed him that everything was being done to prepare for the reception of the Roumanian Government and Court at Kherson ; and, whilst they were together, he (M. Tereschenko) telephoned to M. Tseretelli to telegraph a warning to the local Soviet that if the)?- were guilty of any acts of disrespect towards the Roumanian Court when it arrived they would be at once arrested, and that the same would happen if they obstructed the arrangements which were being made for its reception.On the 17th August Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan [No. 1731] asking him to ascertain exactly what arrangements the Russian Government proposed to make, and telling him that he might make, in concert with his two colleagues, any representation for obtaining satisfaction for legitimate Roumanian demands, which he and his colleagues might think it well to make to the Russian Government. &apos;TURKEY.Neio German Ambassador. On the 20th August Sir W. Townley telegraphed from The Hague [No. 2562] that the &quot; Vossische Zeitung &quot; of the 19th August had learnt that Count Bernstorff had been appointed german ambassador at Constantinople ; it said, too, that his nomination to that place could be greeted with great sympathy, as he was considered one of the most capable of German diplomats.
Prisoners of War. On the 18th August Sir W. Townley transmitted [No. 2546] a.telegram from the Dutch Minister in Constantinople&quot; saying that the Porte would not consider the question of the exchange of civilian prisoners unless&apos; its demand for the release of Sabri was acceded to ; if it were not, all British subjects in Turkey would be confined in concentration camps. The Porte would not agree to the exchange of all British and civilian prisoners in Turkey against all Turkish civilian prisoners in France and England, and considered that it was the more justified in taking up this attitude in that British subjects in Turkey enjoyed the fullest liberty, with the exception of those sent to the interior as a measure of reprisal for the unjustifiable internment of Turkish subjects in England.On the 21st August Mr. Balfour instructed Sir W. Townley to transmit a telegram to the Dutch Minister in Constantinople to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government (in view of the proposal it had made that a conference should be held to discuss the question of prisoners of warj earnestly trusted that his Excellency would make every effort to prevent British subjects being interned by the Porte.THE SENOUSSI.Said Mohammed Idris. Sir Pi. Rodd telegraphed on the 18th August [No. 699] in regard to Sir R. Wingate&apos;s telegram of the 12th August [Eastern Report XXIX, p. 7], saying that he had been informed by the Ministry of the Colonies that assistance in the form of provisions and money had already been accorded to Idris ; the policy indicated in the Cairo telegram w&amp;a also accepted as the only one to be followed and-readiness to act on the lines suggested was expressed.Prisoners of War.-On the 17th Sir R. Rodcl had telegraphed [No. 697] in regard to the prisoners at Misurata saying that the Ministry of the Colonies thought that nothing could be done for them through Idris as they were in the hands of a deadly enemy of his. The Ministry was, moreover, most reluctant to treat Idris as if he had any authority in Tripoli as to thevprisoners, they proposed to work for the two British officers as they were workipg for the release of the Italians, i.e., through various friendly elements.Capture of Turks.  On the 18th August Sir R. Wingate telegraphed [No. 871] that a letter, dated the 19th July, from Mahomet Idris had arrived. He stated that he had arrested, in the neighbourhood of Jedahbia, 149 Turks, including 41 officers, and had captured their arms and ammunition and some Russian machine guns. He intended to send these prisoners, with other suspects, to Kufra on the 21st July, and hoped to make further captures. Sir R. Wingate added that this news was very satisfactory, although the transfer of prisoners to Kufra was not in strict accord with article 2 of our agreement of April last. He proposed to point out this to Idris; but in view of the odium, he had no doubt incurred by this action, which was evidence of his good intentions, he trusted that the Italian Government would agree to our attempting diplomatically to induce him either to hand over these prisoners to us or to deport them. In the meantime they were likely to be comparatively harmless at Kufra.On receipt of this telegram Mr. Balfour instructed Sir R. Rodd [No. 1518] to inform the Italian Government, and express the hope that it would agree to our attempting to induce Idris to hand these Turkish prisoners to us. The attitude of the Turkish Government to British prisoners of war and other British subjects in Turkey made it of great importance for us to have as many Turkish prisoners of standing in our hands as possible.ARABIA.Aden.Change of Control [Eastern Report XXVI, p. 5]. Mr. Montagu telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 15th August in regard to this change, informing him that the new arrangements would take effect at once, and asking him to instruct the Resident at Aden as to this decision. The Resident would report to Cairo, but in regard to all matters affecting Indian interests he would be instructed to keep the Indian Govern-ment informed. The Viceroy telegraphed on the 18th August that the requisite instructions had been sent to Aden.Hejaz.Mustafa Gherchdli. In a despatch dated the 19th July, Sir R. Wingate trans-mitted certain information which he had received from Colonel Wilson in regard to the
activities of this person at Mecca. Cherchali had openly stated that he was the representative of the French Government in every matter. He had discarded his Algerian dress for that of a Mecean, he received large numbers of visitors, and was constantly despatching long cypher telegrams to Paris. He had taken an early opportunity of informing an official of the Hejaz Department of Foreign Affairs that the French Government would be willing to construct railways between Jeddah and Mecca, and in the interior of the country, and, Colonel Wilson had been informed, was rather pressing in the matter. It would be remembered, Sir P. Wingate added, that M. Belief, the French economic expert, who visited Jeddah several months ago, was believed to have made similar proposals to the Mecca officials.Asm.Idrisi and the Hashid Bakil. The Viceroy telegraphed on the 16th August in regard to the telegram despatched by the Resident at Aden on the 10th August [Eastern Report XXIX, p. 4] saying that the Indian Government was of opinion that, as it was impossible to go back from the enlistment of Hashid Bakil by Idrisi (a proceeding which it viewed with considerable misgiving), a British officer or British officers should be sent to Jaizan to ascertain the real aims and objects of the combination, and, if suitable, to arrange a financial settlement with them ; for this purpose it particularly recommended Captain Turton, if he were still at Aden. In regard to the supply of food, it could probably be carried from Aden to Jaizan, if the Shipping Controller could arrange for transport to the former place from Bombay. The Resident telegraphed on the 17th August [428 A.P.] that in accordance with Idrisi&apos;s invitation he proposed to send a British officer to Jaizan, and had selected Major Reilly. This officer not only was in touch with the present situation, and had a working knowledge of Arabic, but he was a persona grata with Idrisi; Captain Turton, who had been recommended by the Government of India, had not been on that station for many months.Idrisi and the Imam. In the same telegram [428 A.P.] the Resident said that Said Mustaffa asserted that Idrisi was prepared to establish friendly relations with any Imam other than the present one, whom he was convinced was strongly in favour of the Turk. The Resident thought that it would be well to acquaint him officially with the confederacy movement, of which he must have knowledge ; but he would expect to take an unduly prominent part, now and in the future, if he were consulted as an ally.Supplies for the Bedawin. The Resident telegraphed on the 14th August [426 A.P.] that he had received a message from H.M.S. &quot;Minto&quot; to the effect that Idrisi had repeated his request for money and provisions which were necessary to prevent the Bedawin from returning to their homes. Given money and provisions, they were prepared to go on ; and Mustaffa urged an immediate advance whilst the Turks were weak.Yemen.The Imam and the Turks. An agent reports that information has been received from Constantinople that the Imam is in treaty with the Turks, who will send him munitions for use against King Hussein.Prisoners at Hodeidah&apos;. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 16th August [No. 861 j that, with a view to obtaining the release of certain British subjects prisoners at Hodeidah, who were reported to have been ill-used, Admiral Gaunt, the Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies station, proposed to visit that place, which it might, in certain eventualities, be necessary for him to bombard. He had asked for Sir R. Wingate&apos;s concurrence in this course, and the latter in turn asked for instructions. On the following day, Mr. Balfour replied [No. 817] that Sir R. Wingate should withhold his concurrence, for, glad as he would be if the release of the prisoners could be secured, a bombardment would be more likely to make their position worse than to obtain their release.The Confederaey.-The Viceroy telegraphed on the 14th August the views of the Indian Government in regard to Sir R. Wingate&apos;s telegram of the 9th August [Eastern Report XXVIII, p. 7]. It was of opinion that, though Sir R. Wingate&apos;s formula was admirable in itself, no formula would save us from the odium of partisan action ; the Yemen seemed to be working up for a general internecine struggle, and before committing ourselves further it would be well to see who came out on top. [898-57] C
Mr. Montagu telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 16th-&apos; August that His Majesty&apos;s Government was in general agreement with the views of the Indian Govern-ment. The best policy seemed to be to avoid committing ourselves to the confederacy for the present, though giving it just enough encouragement to prevent the collapse of the movement, for the reason that, till we were in a position to act ourselves, there seemed no prospect of serious action against the Turks by the Arabs. The formula proposed in Sir R, Wingate&apos;s telegram of the 9th August was quite acceptable, and the Resident might reply on those lines, it being clearly understood that no assistance would be given except for actual results achieved. Mr. Montagu asked for the Viceroy&apos;s views as to taking King Hussein and Idrisi into our confidence.The Shammab.Ibn Bashid and, the Turks. An agent reports that Ibn Rashid is in treaty with the Tui\ks, who will send him munitions for use against King Hussein.PERSIA.The Indian Government on the Persian Demands.-The Viceroy telegraphed the views of his Government in regard to the situation on the 18th August. It suggested that we might agree in principle to the two proposals put forward in the Persian memorandum [Eastern Report XXVII, p. 8] with a view to breaking down Persian mistrust of our intentions, as if this were done there would be some chance of coming to a working understanding, and there would be but little risk, as neither proposal was likely to materialise for some time. The mistrust appeared to be focused on the South Persian Rifles, and it should be pointed out to the Persian Government that this force (which was maintained at our expense) had been raised in the joint interests of the British and Persian Governments, with the consent of the latter, and that it was our only safeguard against the recurrence of outrages against our colonies and our consuls ; until the Persian Government had an adequate force to replace it, we could not agree to its being disbanded, though we might agree to discuss, even during the war, a greater measure of Persian control over the force.LATEST INFORMATION.RUSSIA.The Murman Railway. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 20th August [No-&apos;   1290] that the Counsellor of the Embassy had been informed by Count Benckendorff that he had no doubt that the Murman railway would be opened for traffic on the 14th November.   Count Benckendorff had just returned from an official inspection of the railway.ROUMANIA.Russian Provision for Evacuation [supra, p. 3]. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 20th August [No. 1289] in reply to Mr. Balfour&apos;s inquiry as to the-intentions of the intentions of the Russian Government. He said that M. Terestchenko had informed him that it had been arranged that the Roumanian Government should go to Kherson, and the royal family to a country house not far from that town, whilst the General Staff and the Ministers of allied countries would go with the King to Odessa. The Government would do what it could to meet Roumanian wishes, but he (M. Terestchenko) could not understand why they wished to substitute Poltava for Kherson, which was less Jewish than it was formerly, and was now one of the quietest places in Russia. M. Terestchenko also said that an agreement would shortly be signed on the lines of that between France and Belgium. Sir G. Buchanan added that he would ascertain as soon as possible if the Roumanian Minister was satisfied.Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 21st August [No. 1299] saying that the Roumanian Minister had spoken to him of the proposed arrangements for evacuation, and had expressed his great satisfaction in regard to them and to the spirit of conciliation shown bv the Russian Government.
TURKEY.Internal Conditions. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed on the 21st August [No. 71 lj that it had been reported by a reliable Greek who had left Constantinople a fortnight previously that officers were making money and were quiet, but otherwise there was a fair amount of discontent in the army. The Germans had received instructions to live all together, as they were becoming more nervous in regard to their position, and in case of trouble it was desirable that they should be simultaneously available for any action which might be decided upon. Talaat and Enver were said to be on much worse terms than they had been since the war broke out.ARABIA.Execution of Nuri Shalaan&apos;s Son. An agent reports that Nuri Shalaan&apos;s son was hanged at Damascus on the 8th August. Next day the Arabs killed the officials of the Government and the railway at Maan. The Arabs of Nuri&apos;s tribe in the Jordan valley have fled to the desert.FRIRTBS AT TOT TORBIGIC OJTIOB BT C.  R. HABBISOW.-24/8/1917.

ARABIA. Hejaz.Intelligence.After the successful raids of duly 7, reported in the last bulletin, Sherif Feisal, Gaafar Pasha and Col. Newcombe left Jeida by car on the 11th for Sherif AbdulhuYs camp, where they arrived on the 14th. Abdullah stated that he was not ready to attack the railway as he had insufficient food supplies, owing to the arrival of a party of 2,000 Shammar after the recent defeat of Ibn Hash id (see p. 313). Tic was anxious to postpone all operations for at least twenty days, but was finally persuaded by Col. Newcombe to make a combined attack with Feisal on the railway at the earliest possible date, pending a larger operation when he has more men ready. Col. Joyce and twenty-five Egyptians were left with him to arrange dynamite parties for the first raid, which was timed to take place towards the end of July.El Ula was successfully bombed on July 1 5 by three aeroplanes. Three bombs fell on the station enclosure and one direct bit Avas observed on the water tanks. Damage was also done to buildings and camps.   The enemy opened an ineffective tire with four guns.So far as we have heard,--Arab operations in this area have been confined to the cutting of the telegraph line between Khands and Dizad on July 19 and an attack by 800 Arabs on the Turkish patrols from Dizad to Khamis and Moadhdham towards the end of the month. The latter resulted apparently in about cisjht Turkish casualties and the withdrawal of the Arabs.A shortage of food is again reported along the line, especially in the Tebuk area, where the Turks have been supplying some of the local Arabs as well as their own forces. All wood for the railway engines is being brought from Maan to the Medain Saleh area, where the stock has completely given out.Shortage of water is undoubtedly making operations very difficult in these regions.There has been a lull in the Maan area.At Akaba, Sherif Nasir ibn Hussein has approximately 800 men, of whom 300 are properly armed Ageyl from Wejh. Auda Abu Tayi, who is holding the road from Maan, is reputed to have 6,000 men at Fuweilah ; of these, 2,000 have rifles of British or Turkish pattern, the remainder being armed with obsolete weapons.According to a somewhat obscure report which has been received, the Turkish force under denial the Less advanced about July 25 towards Wegeidab, which is between Fuweilah and Maan Station. Auda Abu Tayi appears to have surrounded it on both flanks, but, on the representations of DeihdlaA.hu Tiyur, an Arab serving with the Turks, foreboro to make an attack and
the force retreated safely to Maan. Whatever the real facts may be, a coolness has arisen between Auda Abu Tayi and Sherif Nasir, who had given orders for an attack.The food question is an urgent one, especially as the Turks have denuded the country of supplies. Sherif Nasir anticipates a large increase in recruits as soon as arms and food are provided ; but there is no doubt that the Turks are making great efforts to win over the tribes around Maau and induce them to assist in an attack on Akaba, and are spending considerable sums of money with this object. The G-.O.C. 8th Army Corps is reported to have sent a messenger to Auda Abu Tayi with the object of inducing the latter to rejoin the Turks.All. reports agree that there is a strong concentration of Turkish troops at Maan and that the enemy intends to advance on Fuweilah as soon as possible. Full precautions are being taken to meet this contingency and Arab reinforcements are being-sent to Akaba, where one of H.M. ships will remain for the present. A hostile aeroplane bombed Akaba on July 2&apos;2 without success. On attempting to land at Maan it is said to have crashed to the ground, one of the crew being killed and the other injured.Prisoners captured at Akaba report that the troops under-stood that they were in the district for garrison duty only, and were much surprised at the hostile attitude of the Arabs. All the Arab soldiers deserted the Turks.More recent information shows that the combined attack by the forces of Sherif Feisal and Sherif Abdullah took place at the end of the month, but the results are not yet fully known. It is reported that Turkish patrols were attacked by the Arabs from that el-Haj to Mustabgha on July 29, and that two Turks were wounded. A reinforcement train which was sent out on the following day to this section of the line was also attacked. Heavy fighting took place on, July 30 and 31 at Kalaat el-Ziimrud and between Seil Matara, and Meshed, the Arabs having previously destroyed the railway between Zuinrud-Seil Matara, Seil Matara-Meshed, and Meshed-Bedai. Several water trains were held up in this neighbourhood on the 31st, but the line between El-Ulaand Bedai is believed to have been cleared on that day by a reinforcement train which brought up a mule M.I. Coy. Later reports state that numerous rails were damaged on the Bedai-Meshed and Toweira-Muderij sectors, and that on the latter sector, where the repairing party lost two killed and two wounded, live bridges were also blown up. The Hadiyah-Abu el-Nairn sector is said to have been reinforced by two Norclenfeldt guns from the Bir el-Mashi. region. El-17la is the present headquarters of the G.O.C. Composite Force.The expected advance of the Turks from Maan towards Akaba has began.   A force estimated by the Arab leaders at six
battalions with quick-firing gnus and accompanied by some Arabs lias moved to Abu Lesal, near Fuweilah, and Auda Abu Tayi has fallen back on Gueira. Reinforcements are being hurried up from Akaba. The Arab forces have killed twenty Turks and captured forty mules.Aeroplanes at Maan have recently been unable to fly, probably owing to lack of vacuum oil,but it is also reported that a, new aeroplane has arrived from Damascus. The Arabs have blown up three arches of the bridge at Anzah station, north of Maan.YEMEN.Overtures from the imam.The imam Yahya, probably prompted by the knowledge that the new confederacy had appealed to the British Government for help, lias sent a Sheikh from the Berii Siham section of the Khaulan el Tawal tribe to Aden with certain proposals. These are, briefly, that he is prepared to make an agreement with the British Government on condition (a) that he is given all Yemen, from Hali Point south, excluding Aden only, but including Asir arid Hadramaut and all seaports in Yemen which used to belong-to his predecessors ; (b) that Idrisi is eliminated from Arabia, and (c) that the Government agrees to communicate with the people of Yemen only through him, or with his knowledge. The Government is invited to give adequate financial assistance and to provide arms and ammunition immediately together with some quick-firing guns and personnel. The envoy claims that the Imam can call up the whole of Yemen at once, including Hashid and Bekil, and that all the tribes are on his side:This communication is interesting as showing- the inordinate lengths to which an Arabian chief, isolated from the world, and surrounded bj^ flatterers, can go.Since the days of Moawiya, under the fourth Khalifate, no rule in Yemen has extended to anything approaching the limits indicated by the Imam. Even in Central Yemen, among the Zeidis themselves, there has been no consecutive stable rule for long ; no dynasty has ever really established itself. Yet the I) re sent ruler claims the remote and Sunnite provinces of Asir and Hadramaut, though he must know that Sun iris, even within his present narrow limits, only accept&apos;his jurisdiction when backed by the machinery of the Ottoman Government. The linam&apos;s influence southward follows the two trade routes to Aden, via Miisernir, or Dthala, and there have always been friendly relations between his house and Lahej, but it is difficult to imagine that big military tribes like Yafa, Aulaqi or Fadhli would brook even the semblance of his suzerainty and certainly not his spiritual dignity, for they are Sunnis throughout and look on him (when they consider him at all) as a schismatic.
Moreover, the Aden Protectorate and Hinterland (excepting Beda, which Sultanate has already been approached by the linam with little result) have treaty relations with the Aden authorities precluding such an arrangement.As regards his claims in Asir, an Asiri chief ruled there for Wahabisin in 1804, and in 1843 Sherif Hussein of Abu Arish (a relative, but a rival, of the Sanaa Imams) ruled Asir and the coast for the Turks, who found him in possession when they entered Yemen.The Imam claims &quot;all seaports in Yemen winch used to belong,to his predecessors,&quot; but appears to ignore the facts that the Egyptian fleet took most of them except Aden in 1514, that they were occupied by the Turks in 1537, and that the littoral was administered by opposition candidates until the return of the Turks in 1843. Since that date, the influence of the Imamate over the coastal towns has been practically non-existant.New Claimant to Imamate.Aden sends us further details about Seyyid Mohammed, the father of the new candidate to the Imamate. He hails from Mayadar, in Habur, north of Shehara. Our suggestion on page 245 of No. 51, that he was Sheikh of Maclan (Midan) in the Hashid country is not accepted by the Hash id messengers. The genealogy is now given, by informants who claim to know the family history, as follows : (1) Al-Qasim ; (2) Mohammed el-Mnayyad ; (3) el-Mortada; (4) ei-Hadi ; (5) oL-Qasim ; (6) Ahmed; (7) Yahya; (8) Seyyid Mohammed ; (9) Yahya, the present candidate.This may be compared with the provisional genealogy given on page 254. The conjecture there made that the succession is to be traced back to the Imam Qasim, prince of all Yemen in the seventeenth century, is continued, as is also the supposition that, in the name as first given us, some of the intermediate links had been skipped.Remarks on the Imamate.To assist in forming a just appreciation of the importance of the new movement headed by Seyyid Mohammed Yahya ibn el-lladi in favour of his son Yahya&apos;s claim to the Imamate, we print the following notes by Lieut. G. Wyman Bury, R.N.V.R The)&apos; are based on personal knowledge and on information from native sources : An Imam must be of Fatimite descent, and, in practice, is always a scion of the original llassite stock which founded the dynasty   in  the  early   tenth   century.    Theoretically, he is
designated by, his predecessor at the instance of the A 111 al-Akfah or lmani&apos;s Council, which is first convened by the Imam at his accession, and may muster up to 200 members of the Ashraf and Sadah. It invites the Imam to appoint his successor before his demise, but, in actual practice, his.choice is much swayed by this council, which elects his successor if he. dies without appointing anyone.An Imam may not be a minor, and &quot;lie must also have attained distinction among ulema or theologians.Direct issue is set aside where these qualifications are wanting.The Imam may reside where he likes within territorial limits, but prestige attaches to residence at Sanaa. The earlier Imams lived at Sadhah, later at Sanaa, then at Kaukeban and afterwards at Sanaa again until the present Turkish occupation.There are two collateral houses, Sharaf ed-Din and flamed eel-Din, between which the Imamate has oscillated for generations, thus fogging genealogies and continuity of succession, for the house to which the Imam belongs is seldom mentioned, so that he may either be a direct heir, or a distant relative of his predecessor.To understand the present situation in Yemen, we need only ff6 back to [mam Mannar al-Qashn of the house of Sharaf ed-Din, which had been driven from Sanaa to Kaukeban and Sheharah by the first Turkish invasion in the sixteenth century and held sway in Sanaa again through Qasim after the Turks had evacuated. Imam Qasim, who extended his power over all Yemen, set aside his own stock as lacking the necessary qualifi-cations and appointed as his successor Hamid ed-Din ibn Mutahir, of the collateral house.The house of Sharaf ed-Din ruled again at Sanaa through Imam Hadi (No. 4 in the Aden genealogy given above), who was succeeded by three Imams of the Hamed ed-Din house, the last of whom is the present ruler.The caudidate is descended, as stated by Aden, from Imam Qasim of the Sharaf ed-Din house, to which natives allude as the Kaukeban house, calling that of Hamed el-Din the Sanaa house. There is little to chose between the claims of either, except the prestige of Qasim and the fact that he set aside his own line for temporary disabilities only.The candidate^ father, Mohammed, held rank under the late Imam as &quot;Emir al-Mcidan,&quot; which means, literally, &quot; Commander of the Plain, or Open Field &quot; i.e. O.C. Cavalry. (No Yemen infantryman conies down on to level, - open ground if he can help it.)When the present Imam was invested with the &quot;tag&quot; or &quot;crown,&quot; which is a gold-brocaded silk turban, he had to convene his council, and omitted to include Mohammed.
Seyyid Mohammed was furious. Apart from his services and rank under the late Imam, lie considered his claim to the Imamate as good as Yahya&apos;s, or any member of the Hamed ed-Din house.He and the present.Imam had also been rival students at the theological college of Marian, near Sheharah, and. anyone who has heard ulema discussing each other can guage the bitterness of such a rivalry.   &apos;Seyyid Mohammed took the field against the Imam soon after his accession some thirteen years ago. Backed by 3,000-4,000 fighting men of Haiur (his district), he put up a very good fight for a year, but was eventually defeated and taken prisoner.His status as Seyyid saved him from the death penalty which any sacrilegious outsider would certainly have incurred.He considered that he would make a better Imam than Yahya, fought for his opinion and lost. No stigma attached to him among the Ashraf and Sadah, who procured his release after he had been immured for some months in the fortress at Qaflat Udhr as a political prisoner.In this connection it should be noted that two Imams cannot co-exist amicably in Yemen, which has been rent by their quarrels for centuries. Each must be an impostor to the other and his adherents. The very name &quot; Imam &quot; implies a national leader who goes in front and shows the way. There can be but one right road anywhither. Any suggestion that there should be more than one Imam is blasphemy to Zeidis and Sunnis alike in Yemen.After his release Seyyid Mohammed remained hi comparative obscurity until, the present crisis. He has presumably proposed his son as candidate in order to leave himself free as President of the League oE Ashraf ancl Sadah, which may be identified with the Ahl al-Akfah - a potential Inmiifs Council.The candidate&apos;s position is much strengthened by the adherence of Seif ul-Islam.Seif ul-Islam Seyyid Mohammed Yusuf is of the house of I lamed erl-Din and one of the Imam&apos;s best generals. After the Turks capitulated at Sanaa, in 1905 he swept southwards along the main plateau, taking one Turkish garrison town after another in quick succession, it was then that he firmly established his influence and prestige in Baclan. which is a large and mountainous district impinging on Yerim, Ibb and Qatabeh and dominating the routes between those towns. Its inhabitants are warlike and united ; they are in a position to give the Turks a good deal of trouble. Seif ul-Islam is also connected by marriage . with the Sheikhs of the Ban a valley, near Sadclah. (A Sherif, Seyyid or Imam may marry a woman of nOn-Fatimite descent, but the converse is sacrilege.)He came down to Aden some six years ago to arrange for the transport of the Irnam&apos;s minting-machine to Sheharah, where
he has also established a munitions factory and repairing-shops for small-arms. Before the war his name was generally mentioned among Ashraf and Sadah as .the next Imam, and Yemen Sadah in Cairo, who are unaware of the trend of events, still consider his succession a certainty.It will be seen that the coalition between these two men, if genuine, is a strong one, for the candidate^ descent entitles him to serious consideration in a country that is practically ruled by a religious aristocracy, and Seif nl-Islam, besides being an energetic and dominant personality, is a prominent member of the collateral house.It is relevant to note that over and over again in the recent history of south-western Arabia some prominent and powerful personage has put forward the claims of a lesser personality to nominal dignities, while himself retaining the real power. One might quote the Ashars of Upper Yafa and the puppet Sultan of Loder as examples, but there are many others, for the office of &quot;kingmaker&quot; appeals to the shrewd Arabian statesman he can use his protege as a. political weather-vane and a lightning conductor in case of storms ; for his own power and prestige need not suffer if he abandoned his&apos;candidate in good time and there still remains his own claim to urge, or that of a. more popular candidate.LIBYA.The Prospects of &quot;Mohammed Idris.It is still early to attempt a detailed enquiry into the effect upon the Cyrenaican situation of the agreement with Mohammed Idris described in Bulletin No. 50. There are indications, how-ever, that affairs are shaping themselves along the expected lines and that Idris is beginning to exert an increasing influence amongst the Cyrenaicau Sheikhs.He has now taken up his residence in the southern coastal district of Western Cyrenaica and is reported to be busily occupied in organizing the tribes of those parts against any attempted eastward move on the part of Ramadan Scwehli.An instance of Idris&apos; growing prestige and authority may be cited in the recent secession of San ed-Din from his brother Seyyid Ahmed aiid his definite adherence to his cousin. As a concrete fact, this is a valuable indication of the undoubtedly prevalent trend of popular religious opinion amongst the followers of the Senussi tenets in these parts.In fact, it is now highly improbable that, even if he attempted to do so, Seyyid Ahmed could ever again attain to the leadership of the Senussi sect except, perhaps, by resorting to purely fanatical propaganda in direct opposition to the temperate and reasonable jurisdiction of Idris.
Such a, course might be expected to meet with a certain amount of. popularity of a local nature and it is a, contingency which Nuri lias probably had well in mind in his repeated endeavours to restore to Seyyid Ahmed some measure of his shattered reputation by promises, gifts and flattery. Meanwhile it is strongly rumoured from the oasis district, immediately south of the Gulf of Sert (where Seyyid Ahmed is at present to he found), that the ancient hostility between Ramadan and Seyyid Ahmed has been set aside and that Nuri has brought about a reconciliation between them. It may be inferred,however, from what is known of the respective characters of the two protagonists, that mutual distrust and dislike will not readily be patched up by any mere agreement or understanding negotiated by a. third party, whom both probably regard as an outsider.However, it may well be questioned what benefit. Ramadan is likely to reap from entering into partnership with one who, whether from a political, religious, or military point of view, can only be considered as bankrupt. It will be well, therefore, to await some more tangible manifestation of co-operation between these two old enemies before recording a definite success for Nuri and his schemes.There are no signs that I * Iris is not able to hold his own in Cyrenaica and, in this respect, the situation may be considered as satisfactory. Had there been any pronounced reluctance on the part of the tribes of Cyrenaica to accept Idris as the hereditary chieftain of the Senussi faith, it is safe to assume that by now such reluctance would have taken active shape.On the contrary, however, all reports point to ready consent on the part of these tribes, many of which have sent delegates to pay personal homage to their religious leader.The only menace, therefore, to the general satisfactory state of affairs in Cyrenaica seems to be Ramadan and what he intends to do with his reported well-equipped and numerous army, of which the main body, estimated at four to live thousand, is now encamped at Misurata on the eastern const of Tripoli.In estimating Ramadaids chances, should he succeed in over-coming the well-known reluctance of his followers to leave their own country and advance east under his leadership, it must be remembered that such a move would immediately expose his present stronghold to attack by the Italians. Further, the Senussi of the Sert district number amongst them many trusty adherents of Idris who would vigorously oppose, as indeed they have already done, any intrusion on Ramadan&apos;s part. Idris&apos; personal presence in the Gedabia district, too, would tend to stiffen their resistance as, though not now in actual touch, it would not be difficult for him to hurry west.and assume control in Sert.All things being considered, then, the chances would seem to be against any eastward move on the part of Ramadan, but, at the same time, the fact should not be overlooked that, sooner or later,
NOTES.The Situation at Qatif.The following information has been supplied to the Political Agent at Bahrein by Dr. Harrison, an American Mission doctor, who returned on May 8 from a long visit to Qatif : &quot; The population is entirely Shiah, with the exception of Ibn Saud&apos;s officials and their retainers, some 200 in all.&quot; The Amir of Qatif, Abdurrahman ibn Abdullah ns Suwailim, is a sound man, devoted to Ibn Saud&apos;s interests, and, as neither he nor his adherents extort money- from, or otherwise oppress, the inhabitants to any extent, he is well liked ancl there is no Sbiah-Sunni friction.&quot;All Ibn Saucls officials are strongly pro-British, even when speaking in a hostile assembly. The inhabitants of Qatif were very pro-,German, and probably are still in their innermost thoughts, but, as the result of the fall of Baghdad and the vigorous spreading abroad of Allied war-news, British prestige is now as high as it was before the war. The regular receipt of official news, telegrams and extracts from Reuter&apos;s is much appreciated.&quot; The people are much exercised in their minds as to why, after a longish occupatiou of Iraq, we do not open up the pilgrim routes, and are inclined to think that we are purposely preventing pilgrims from going to the Holy Places Avithout reason. The issue of a notification that the several pilgrim routes will be opened as soon as possible is strongU7 recommended, as also that the shrines at Samarra are safe.&quot; People are all strongly anti-Russian, and evince con-siderable curiosity as to the situation in Russia. They look upon the entry of the United States of America into the war as an additional proof of the righteousness of the Allied cause.&quot;Ibn Saud.In consequence of Sherif Abdullah&apos;s remarks about Ibn Saud in his letter to his father (see p. 314 above) and reports from other sources that King Hussein was taking up an unsympathetic attitude towards Ibn Saud and the Idrisi, Colonel Wilson took the opportunity during a recent interview to speak of these chiefs in complimentary terms, and to remind the King ,of our treaty obligations towards them, ancl of the policy  which   His  Majest3&apos;&apos;s Government had pursued  fromRamadan will certainly be strongly pressed to make some return for Turco-German &quot; services rendered,&quot; and that he will have to make up his mind to move in one direction or the other.Whether this will be an altogether voluntary move or not is another matter that remains to be seen.
the beginning of the war. .TJie/ reply of the King was quite satisfactory. He stated tliaV^J*e had every intention of adhering to his promise of non-interference with the affairs of Ibn Saud and the ldrisi, but that he preferred to wait, until the Turks had been finally expelled from the Hejaz before dealing with internal Arabian politics. He would then be guided entirely by the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Ibn saud has kept the King informed of his peace negotiations with Ibn ltashicl. After they had failed, owing to Ibn KashicVs refusal to ally himself with the British and the King of the Hejaz (see p. 269 above), Saleh ibn Athl, who had been Ibn SaucTs envoj&apos; to Hail, was sent to Mecca to make a. full report to the King. This action on the part of Ibn Saud bears out the impression gained from the letters on the subject which have been received by Sir Percy Cox, and which he describes as straightforward, uncompromising and entirely loyal to the King and ourselves. Sherif Abdullah, it seems, was influenced, in writing as he did, by the intrigues of one Ibn Dakhdivi, who has since been cast into prison at Mecca. Ibn saud, in a recent friendly letter to the King, makes no mention of his intention to make the pilgrimage, but his father the Imam Abdurrahman who wrote at the same time asked Avh ether there would be any objection to his coming himself. It is understood that the King will encourage his doing so.Capture ofTeima.It is reported that Teima, has been taken by the local Sheikh, who is, presumably, of the YVulucl Suleiman, on behalf of the King of the Hejaz.Ibn Rashid&apos;s representative was killed, and fifty Turkish prisoners captured. Teima, which lies about seventy- five miles d ue east of Moarlhdham, is on the main roads from the north and west to Hail, and its capture should seriously interfere with communica-tions between Ibn Rashid and the Turks. The Shammar are said to be exerting pressure on Ibn Rashid to, make peace with the King of the Hejaz, and to have threatened to take matters into their own hands in the event of his refusal.Arabs at Kabul.It is reported from Kabul that some Arabs (professional beggars who visit Afghanistan annually), have, contrary to the old practice, been ill-treated and abused - by the Turkopbile element here, among whom the most prominent are Mabmud Tarzi, Naib-us-Saltanat, and 1V1 ustaufi Mirza Mohammed Husain. These Arabs were persecuted for no fault of their own but merely because their nation had thrown off the 3?oke of Turkish rule, which was, according to their persecutors, heresy and sedition on the part of the Arabs as a nation.Yemen News.A rumour is current at Lahej that terms of peace are being discussed between Bias Bey of Ibb and the followers of the late Negib Hassan Abu Ras (see p. 304).
