SECRET.156APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN   REPORT No. XLI.Russia.IT is impossible to comment on the liussian situation ; the long awaited crisis eems at last to have arisen.Turkey.Special attention is drawn to the account of our prisoners in Turkey which om.es from a source of the highest authority. -Its reading is more than painful, but i necessary, in view of the fact that the Turks are still regarded by many as superior 1 humanity to the Germans or Austrians. It can be assumed confidently that the orrible treatment described arises from deliberate and premeditated action of the )tto;nan Governusnt. Special attention is drawn to the reference to General bwnshend; this oficer has been exhibited by the Turks as a show piece, and his hotograpbs in motors and palaces have frequently appeared in our own press. It is suggested that the present letter should be made public. As the Turks are by nature juilies, it is more than likely that if any success attends our arms which menaces the fundamental security of the Empire the treatment of our prisoners might improve.Turkey.   (Balkan Relations.)Attention is drawn to the interesting report in regard to the causes of the German Emperor&apos;s journey to Sophia.Turkey.   (Austro-German Advance in Italy.)Regrettable as the Italian defeats are, they cannot be welcome in Turkey. The 3.U.P. view would prefer undecided actions in Europe coupled with Turkish successes a Mesopotamia and Palestine. The present is the converse and indicates in future the jrowing of the power of Germany and the exhaustion of the Turks, which even the 1U.P. must view with alarm.M. S.November 8, 1917.1898-681

Buchanan telegraphed on the 31st October [No. 1724] that the Bolsheviks had postponed their threatened demonstration till the 7th November. If they did not then come out it would show that they recognised that they had no chance against the Government, which would then suppress their papers and meetings; if, on the other hand, they did come out they would be suppressed in either case the situation would on that date be cleared up one way or the other. IV). Tereschenko, he said in another telegram of the same date [No. 1728]. thought that the moment was favourable for a rising, as the Bolshevists would be able to make capital out of the economic situation, a,nd it was probable that the majority of the troops in Petrograd would join them. The Government, however, would be able to deal with them, as troops and artillery were being brought from the front. M. Tereschenko went on to say that if the Bolsheviks were suppressed he hoped that a strong Government would be formed, and the Soviet suppressed, in which case M. Kerensky would retire, though he could not say who his successor would be; but Sir G. Buchanan thought that M. Tereschenko was over-sanguine.M. Skobeleff and the Conference.- Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 31st October [No. 1732] that M. Tereschenko had informed him that M. Skobeleff would express his views on any question under discussion to him personally, but would not be allowed to give public utterance of them at the conference. M. Skobeleff was, he said, to be attached to him as a sort of democratic councillor, and was not to be regarded as a representative of the Soviet at the conference, but as a delegate appointed by the Russian Government. M. Tereschenko had himself made it quite clear that Russia could only speak with one voice at the conference bis own; this was in his speech to the provisional council.Telegraphing on the following day [No. 1736] Sir G. Buchanan said that this speech had not gone far enough to satisfy the Right, whilst the Left declared that M. Tereschenko had rendered co-operation between the Government and democracy almost impossible by his uncompromising attitude on the subject of the Soviet instruc-tions to M. Skobeleff. According to a statement in the press the latter had complained to M. Kerensky of the position in which he was placed.[898-68] B
On the 2nd November he telegraphed again [No. 1741] saying that according to press reports the question of the conference had been discussed in detail by MM. Kerensky and Skobeleff. The latter declared that the democracy considered that it was undesirable that M. Tereschenko should participate in the conference, as his views were unacceptable and rendered impossible the inclusion of that party in any delegation of which he should be leader, and if the Provisional Government could not substitute some other representative for him, the revolutionary democracy would rather take no part in the forthcoming conference at Paris. He further expressed the opinion that the members of the delegation, should come to a definite agreement on all funda-mentai questions before leaving PetrogTad, and pointed out that the Soviet instructions did not preclude amendments which would facilitate such an agreement. M. Kerensky then conferred with the leaders of the various democratic parties in the provisional council, and found that they regarded the differences of opinion between MM. Tereschenko and Skobeleff as irreconcilable, and declared that the sending of the former to the conference would lead to undesirable complications. M. Tereschenko, they said, regarded the, righ ts of nationalities as the matter of primary importance, whilst the democratic parties gave the first place to the speedy conclusion of the war and thought that M. Tereschenko&apos;s views were likely to lead to a useless prolongation of it.On the same day Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed again [No. 1742], saying that he had been informed by M. Tereschenko that M. Skobeleff had adopted a more conciliatory attitude in his speech at the meeting of the provisional council that morning ; he had spoken of his instructions as the wishes, not the demands, of the democracy in the event of the questions dealt with in them coming up for discussion. But he could not then say whether M. Skobeleff would go to the conference.The Minister for War. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 2nd November [No. L742J saying that he had learnt from M. Tereschenko that the Minister for War held that the only way to keep the soldiers in the trenches was to publish our conditions of peace (and so to throw the responsibility of continuing the war on Germany), as it was necessary for them to know what they were fighting for. M. Tereschenko said that the Government could not consent to this, but he hoped that the Minister for War would withdraw his resignation after the question had been discussed at a Cabinet Council that evening.Telegraphing again on the following day FNo. 1749], Sir G. Buchanan said that he had been informed that afternoon by M. Tereschenko that the resignation of the Minister for War had been accepted and that the Government proposed to choose a general unconnected with politics as his successor. The previous evening at the sitting of the committee of the provisional council, he had declared that Russia must make peace and that on its conclusion, to ensure the. maintenance of order, a military director would have to be appointed. M. Tereschenko at once objected to such a statement being made in the presence of colleagues who had not been consulted, and in this he was supported by all the members of the council. The Minister for War had that morning expressed his regret at having lost his head owing to a nervous breakdown.The Cossacks. The following message sent out from the German wireless stations has been intercepted : The conference of representatives of the Cossack troops and the mountainous tribes of the Caucasus, wdiich have been in session at Wladikawkas, ended with the signature of an agreement by wdiich a south-eastern union of the Cossack troops, the mountain inhabitants of the Caucasus, and the free tribes of the steppes has been formed. This union will have its own government, in which each party will be represented by two deputies. The government for its part apj)points from among its members a representative to the Provisional Republican Government.Congress of Local Military Representatives. - From the same source comes the following: The congress of local military representatives has concluded its sittings, and calls upon the Government to end the war and to issue laws for the confirmation of (?....) republican state rule,TURKEY.The British Prisoners taken at Kut. The following account of the march from Kut wras received quite recently. For obvious reasons the source cannot be stated, but the story may be accepted as quite authentic the name of the writer is sufficient guarantee for this.
The writer begins by saying that to rightly understand his narrative, the starved and dysentery-stricken condition of the garrison at the time of the surrender of Kut must be realised. But he thinks that this and the distressing scenes and conditions of the camp at Shamran will be known already, so he passes on to the march from that place to Anatolia.From Shamran all officers were sent up to Baghdad by boat, but the men were made to march Many painful stories have, he says, been heard of that march, of how our poor fellows fell from exhaustion by the way, and were kicked and beaten by their Arab escort to rise again, until in some cases they dropped down dead; but this is only hearsay.On arrival at Baghdad the men were placed in blazing hot camps, without rest, and in spite of the protests of our own medical officers as to their unfitness, they were then despatched (that is, all those not actually prostrate) in large batches without any of their own officers on that terrible march of some 500 miles across a desert-like country; officers, including generals, had been sent on in one party ahead of the men. The writer of this story, however, followed later along the same route taken by the men.It was, he says, beyond his powers of description to convey a picture of what he saw at some of the various halting-places en route Arab villages or small police-posts commanded by an Arab or Turkish officer or under-officer (all alike a mixture of brutish callousness, stupidity, and ignorance). At such places he came across parties of our men too exhausted to go further. They were lying about under any shelter or in any mud-hovel given to them, some on the bare ground ; others lucky to possess a blanket;&apos; many half clothed and without boots, which they had sold to purchase milk to keep life within them. There they lay in all stages of dysentery and semi-starvation;&apos; many terribly emaciated, some almost living skeletons, some dying, some dead. There were no medicines, and only at some places a hospital attendant or hospital assistant had been left to look after them.Their one cry was for milk, and the officer of the post had regarded their sufferings with complete indifference, excusing himself with the plea that he had no authority to spend money to provide milk. A loaf of coarse black bread was, as far as the writer saw, the only nourishment given to our poor men to keep life in them. He first encountered these scenes at Tekrit, a considerable Arab village, having a civil official and a military commandant, some thirty miles distant from Samara. At that place he found about 300 of our men, British and Indian, who could no longer proceed, many of them being in the condition described above; but there were similar instances in lesser numbers at other places along the road. On one occasion he picked up on the road over the Amanus range some British soldiers lying abandoned as they could no longer keep up. They were without food except for some bread given to them by a passing Austrian officer. Further on, at a place Hasancl Begli, a considerable village with a post under a Turkish officer, he found other British soldiers. They were lying neglected and utterly exhausted in a large shed ; it might almost be said that they were lying in their excrement, for they were all so exhausted with dysentery that they had scarcely strength to crawl to the door of the shed to relieve themselves. They had arrived early that morning. No food had then been given to them, though a half-baked black loaf was given later on. The writer himself procured that carts should be provided, and took them all on (including those picked up on the road) to Mamuri, where they were kindly treated by the German commandant and sent to a German hospital ; and it ought to be said here that the only humanity shown to our men was by an occasional Austrian or German officer. The writer sent a letter to Flaiil Pasha at Baghdad from Tekrit, informing him of the state of things, and asking lor English doctors and medicine to be sent along the route, and heard later that a doccor (English) did come to Tekrit. He also saw Shef ket Pasha at Aleppo, and sent a full report to Enver Pasha, who replied that he could not believe that it was true. The writer said that he was not the only one who could testify to the absolute negiect of and the filth amongst otir sick soldiers at the hospital at Nisibirn and the brutal indifference of the Turkish commandant at that place.He said, too, that he had been told that a letter had appeared in the &quot; Times &quot; from General Townshend speakiug of his good treatment by the Turks ; but if that letter had given the impression that all were well treated it would have created a very wrong one. The treatment of officers of every rank had often been disgraceful, and he knew that they (the officers) were still subjected to petty, tyrannical, and often humiliating restrictions.
CYRENAICA.Assistance for Idrisi. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir R. Wingate on the 6th November [No. 1038] informing him of a request made by Idrisi to the Italian Government for money and war material to enable bim to defeat an attack threatened by the Turkish party and to hold his territory. The Italian Government considered that Idrisi&apos;s position had been weakened by his having signed the agreements, and recognised the danger of refusing him support, but at the same time it hesitated to grant war material, from a fear that the Turks might obtain possession of them after defeating Idrisi. Colonel Talbot, Mr. Balfour said, was quite satisfied that there was no idea of treachery on the part of Idrisi, but he thought that he might be using the Turkish menace as a pretext for obtaining arms. His fear was that if Idrisi felt himself too weak to resist he might yield the control of Cyrenaica to Sayed Ahmed. The Italian Government had consulted His Majesty&apos;s Government, and Mr. Balfour asked whether Sir R. Wingate thought it advisable to urge the acceptance of Idrisi&apos;s request. Colonel Talbofs opinion was that the Italian Government might be left to decide the question for itself, on the ground that it was the one chiefly concerned and best able to apprize the situation.PERSIA.Proposals from the Shah. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 27th October [No. 360J that he had received a visit from Kavam-us-Snltaneh on behalf of the Shah. Kavam-us-Sultaneh, who is a brother of Vossuk-ecl-Dowleh, said that his Majesty wished to form a Cabinet which would have the confidence of Sir C. Marling if the latter could ensure conditions which would enable it to work; the Shah was anxious to do this as he re dised the bad state of things in Persia. To ensure such a smooth working, his Majesty considered that the following conditions were essential: a supply of arms, a considerable monthly subvention, and a payment of the moratorium instalments without the control of the mixed financial commission and at a minimum rate of 55.Sir C. Marling pointed out that the getting rid of an incompetent Cabinet was urgently required in the interests of the country, and it seemed to him that we were being asked to pay for something which was to their own advantage. The Shah, he said, must be under the impression that Persian goodwill was a matter of consequence to us, the truth being that our assistance was the urgent need of Persia. As to the conditions, the British Government would not be disposed to agree to the removal of the control of the commission, but it was, and always had been, well disposed to Persia, and therefore might modify the moratorium as suggested. He thought, too, that His Majesty&apos;s Government might agree to give the arrears of the last six months to a new and friendly Cabinet, but he doubted as to the possibility of arms being supplied.He telegraphed again on the 5th November [No. 372] saying that the Shah was urging Kavam-us-Sultaneh to help patch up the Cabinet, which had made another half-hearted attempt at resignation. He (Sir C. Marling) had advised him to decline to do this, and he thought that his advice would be followed. Sir Charles told him that he had not received a reply to his telegram of the 27th October, but he had reason for hoping that the overdue instalments would not be refused if the composition of the new Cabinet were satisfactory, though it must not be expected that these instalments would be paid in one lump; he said, too, that he thought that he could give a personal assurance in regard to the rate of exchange. He had no indication as to what the attitude of the British Government would be in regard to the subsidy, but the sum suggested was enormous ; nor could he say. anything about a supply of arms.. The recognition of the South Persian Rifles for the period of the war must be insisted cn, but he might be able to suggest some immediate concession, such as the appointment of a suitable person to a high post in it. Kavam-us-Sultaneh inquired as to the mixed financial commission, as to whether the British Government would agree to its dissolution, and was told that no hope of this could be held out.In regard to the latter point, Sir C. Marling said that a concession in form would be greatly appreciated, and suggested that the commission might be confined to the control of moratorium accumulations, with the provision that in the case of future instalments and of the subsidy, if granted, a list of the payments proposed to be made from them should be sent to the legations. He added that the Italian disaster could not fail to have an adverse effect; accurate news of it had, he said, reached Persia.
CYRENAIOA.Assistance for Idrisi. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to .Sir R. Wingate on the 6th November [No. 1038] informing him of a request made by Idrisi to the Italian Government for money and war material to enable him to defeat an attack threatened by the Turkish party and to hold his territory. The Italian Government considered that Idrisi&apos;s position had been weakened by his having signed the agreements, and recognised the danger of refusing him support, but at the same time it hesitated to grant war material, from a fear that the Turks might obtain possession of them after defeating Idrisi. Colonel Talbot, Mr. Balfour said, was quite satisfied that there was no idea of treachery on the part of Idrisi, but he thought that he might be using the Turkish menace as a pretext for obtaining arms. His fear was that if Idrisi felt himself too weak to resist he might yield the control of Cyrenaica to Sayed Ahmed. The Italian Government had consulted His Majesty&apos;s Government, and Mr. Balfour asked whether Sir B. Wingate thought it advisable to urge the acceptance of idrisis request. Colonel Talbot&apos;s opinion was that the Italian Government might be left to decide the question for itself, on the ground that it was the one chiefly concerned and best able to apprize the situation.PERSIA.Proposals from the Shah. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 27th October [No. 360J that he had received a visit from Kavam-us-Sidtaneh on behalf of the Shah. Kavam-us-Sultaneh, who is a brother of Vossuk-ecl-Dowleb, said that his Majesty wished to form a Cabinet which would have the confidence of Sir C. Marling if the latter could ensure conditions which would enable it to work ; the Shah was anxious to do this as he redised the bad state of things in Persia. To ensure such a smooth working, his Majesty considered that the following conditions were essential: a supply of arms, a considerable monthly subvention, and a payment of the moratorium instalments without the control of the mixed financial commission and at a minimum rate of 55.Sir C.

He added that the Italian disaster could not fail to have an adverse effect; accurate news of it had, he said, reached Persia.
AFGHANISTAN.Internal Situation. The Viceroy telegraphed on the 31st October giving his monthly report of the situation in Afghanistan, which was then quiet and normal. He had received a most friendly letter from the Amir, who expressed his gratitude for the Viceroy having accepted his advice in regard to the Mahsuds ; he said too that the letter which the Viceroy had written thanking him for his help in that matter had strengthened his friendship. He reciprocated the Viceroy&apos;s feeling of friendship, and said that he would never write a single word devoid of advantage to the British Government or wanting in friendship.A German Party. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 3rd November [No. 366] that a telegram had been received from Meshed to the effect that on the 26th October a party of Germans had left Herat in a south- westerly direction.LATEST &apos; INTELLIGENCE.RUSSIA.The Maximalists and the Government.  The. following telegram appears in the &quot;Times &quot; of this date (8th November) :-.&apos; petrograd, November 7. An armed naval detachment, acting under the orders of the Maximalist revolutionary committee, has occupied the offices of the official Petrograd telegraph agency. The Maximalists have also occupied the central telegraph office, the State bank, and the Marie palace, where the Preliminary Parliament, the proceedings of which have been suspended in view of the situation, has been holding its sittings. Up to the present no disorders have been reported, with the exception of some outrages by hooligans.   Street traffic and the general life of the city remain normal.November 6. The dispute between the general staff of the military district of Petrograd and the new revolutionary military committee of the Soviet became considerably aggravated this evening, when the negotiations which had been begun on the basis of strengthening the democratic elements in the staff were broken off.The committee, having been informed that the military governor of Petrograd had summoned during the night troops from the environs of the capital, notably from Peterhof, Pavlovsk, and Tsarskoe Selo, issued orders to these troops not to obey the Government. The situation was also complicated by the fact that three Maximalist and two of the Right party.&apos;s newspapers had been suspended by M. Kerensky.About 5 o&apos;clock this afternoon the authorities ordered the bridges joining the workmen&apos;s quarters and the centre of the city to be disconnected, thus stopping the trams from running. The city is now guarded by troops who are faithful to the Government.According to further details concerning the dispute between, the revolutionary military committee and the Petrograd general staff, members of the committee on the night of the 4th November called upon the general staff and demanded the right to control all its orders and to participate in its military deliberations. Colonel Polkov-nikoff, commander of the Petrograd district, having refused these demands, the Soviet convened a meeting of delegates from the garrison, who sent to each regiment a telephone message announcing that, as a result of the uncompromising attitude of the general staff, which refused to recognise the revolutionary committee, the Soviet had decided to break off relations with the general staff, and it would henceforth be considered as an anti-democratic organisation. At the same time the message invited the troops only to observe orders signed by the revolutionary military committee.When the Provisional Government heard of the action of the committee it ordered the latter&apos;s telephone instructions to be cancelled. The committee refused to-do this, however, and decided to resist the Government. With this object machine-gun detachments were moved to the headquarters of the Soviet. In these circum-stances the Government resolved not to have recourse to armed force for the time being, hoping for a peaceful settlement of the dispute.A plenary sitting of- the Government yesterday evening decided to regard the revolutionary military committee as an illegal organisation. The Minister of Justice was asked to prosecute the members of the committee, and it was proposed that the military authorities should take all necessary measures in case of a revolt against the Government. Renter.[898-68] C
Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 7th November [No. 1766] that the night before the Government had been defeated in the Provisional Council. Having regard to the political situation, no attempt had been made to arrest the revolutionary military committee. Nearly all the troops in the garrison were on the side of the Soviet, and Sir George Buchanan had been told that it had control of half Petrograd. It was to .meet that day. Its course would probably be to present an ultimatum and then itself form a Government; it had already guaranteed the maintenance of order. The Provisional Government had a choice between the suppression of the Soviet and complete surrender; and it had already received an offer of their services from the Cossacks.POLAND.The Council of Regency. The &quot; Morning Post &quot; of the 8th November publishes the following contribution from a Polish correspondent: According to news from Warsaw, the installation of the Council of Regency took place at Warsaw on the 27th October, with great pomp, in the palace of the Polish kings and afterwards in the cathedral. The Council of Regency has issued an appeal to the nation, in which, among other things, it declares: &quot; We shall build the foundation of an independent and strong Polish state, with a strong government, diet, and army, Our historic past and the importance which Poland will have in the future Europe requires such a state. We are aware that we must at the same time dry the tears, heal the wounds, and fight the famine and poverty caused by this war.&quot;All three members of the Regency, Archbishop Kakowski, Prince Zdzislaw Lubomirski, and Jozef Ostrowski, exhort the nation to be united, to forget all discords, and to work together for the future of the country.The only sentence referring to the occupying Powers in the appeal and in the speeches was as follows :  v&quot; We wish to conduct the nation towards independence on the basis of the decrees promulgated by the monarchs of the Central Powers on the 5th November, 1916, and the 12th September, 1917. These important decrees have opened out to Poland a way that has been closed for 120 years. We plant ourselves on this basis with a loyalty conformable to the seriousness and greatness of this historic moment and to the honour of the Polish nation.&quot;The new Polish Government is composed of elements quite different from those of the former Council of State. They are men who up till now have not been engaged in any far-reaching policy of compromise with Germany, men belonging to the Polish Conservative Party, which is not very large hi Poland, but contains men of great experience and weight. Other parties, the Democratic National, the Progressist, &amp;c, which have been working till now with the Conservatives in the Union of Parties, are not represented either in the Regency or in the Ministry. They wait for the development of events, and it is probable that the greater part of public opinion is expressed in the following words of the &quot; Kurjer Poznanski&quot; (Posen) : -&quot; The extent to which it will be possible for the nation to support the Regency will depend on the means which it takes for the realisation of its programme. All that can bring us to the complete realisation of our national ideals will have the full support of all Poles. All Poles are aware of the difficulties in the way. No one demands impossibilities. There is one thing only that the nation could never permit, i.e., any compromise which would signify the resignation of ancient and historical national rights.&quot;The installation of the Regency has taken place after very protracted consultations with the German Government, and German public opinion is not highly satisfied with the results of the compromise.The Emperor of Austria and Poland. The following appears in the &quot; Times &quot; of the 8 th November : (From our Special Correspondent.)Amsterdam, November 7. According to a Berlin telegram, the &quot; Lokalanzeiger &quot; says that the Crown Council has solved the Polish question in agreement with Austrian wishes. The Emperor Charles receives the title of King of Poland. Poland is to be attached to Austria by a personal union.   Galicia is to be added to Poland.   Lithuania
and Courland wUl probably fall to Prussia, and the King of &quot;Prussia is to receive the title of Grand Prince of Lithuania and Duke of courland.Amsterdam, November 7. The &quot; Vossische Zeitung&quot; denies the report that the Emperor Charles is to be proclaimed King of Poland. Negotiations are still proceeding, and no solution of the Lithuanian and Courland questions has yet been reached. &apos; Renter.TURKEY.The German Emperor. The following information has been furnished by a foreign diplomatist: 1. Germano-Bulgar Treaty. Bulgaria, before appearing on the scene, had concluded a treaty with the Central Powers granting her the whole of the Dobrudja as far as the Danube, Macedonia, with the greater portion of Thrace, and the frontiers laid down in the treaty of San Stephano, part of Eastern Serbia, including Nish and Vranje. The Germans at that time were in great need of Bulgaria&apos;s participation, as it gave them tree communication with Turkey. They signed and had signed all Bulgarian requests. Some months after Bulgaria&apos;s entry into the war the situation changed. The Central Powers began by demanding that the Bulgars should send their avadable forces to other fronts than the Balkan ones : they demanded from them a more effective participation in the war and on all the fronts ; the Bulgarian staff refused this.2. German Blackmail. Then began a regular blackmailing campaign. Very cunningly, Germany exploited the old dissensions existing between Turkey and Bulgaria, leaving the latter to understand that Turkey could never agree to the cession of all the Dobrudja, as she did not wish to risk seeing her supply-channel entirely in the hands of the Bulgars. The Turks, egged on by the Germans, demanded the revision of the treaty signed before Bulgaria came in, and it is in consequence of the acute situation which was created thus that King Ferdinand and Radoslavoff made their journey to the German head-quarters. Called upon to decide the dispute and to make a plain statement, Germany let it be understood that she saw herself constrained to admit &quot; that the Bulgarian claims were disproportionate to the effort put out by her&quot; ; and that each country must earn its own share in the war, and finally that there was one means of reconciling everything : &quot; To help the Turks in the Baghdad expedition.&quot;3. The Bulgarian Riposte. -King Ferdinand and Radoslavoff came back disabused The &quot; Narodniak &quot; party was making a violent agitation in the country, complaining of Germany and talking of a separate peace ; they were allowed to go on doing so. In addition, a crowd of Bulgar emissaries were authorised to go to Switzerland with more or less official instructions to enter into conversations with the Entente. Eventually Germany, Austria, and Turkey grew uneasy at Bulgarians equivocal attitude (Angheloffs mission), which justified a belief in a sudden Bulgarian defection.4. The Sofia Conversations. This uneasiness grew to such a point that William II thought it best for him to go to Sofia. His visit, which came so unexpectedly, cannot be interpreted in any other way. The situation was daily growing more confused. The Germans seemed no longer to agree to leave us the mastery of the Black Sea, fearing a Russo-Bulgar agreement in the future. They had just tried to carry out a manoeuvre which would have been very dangerous for us if the Bulgar general staff had agreed to it, and which consisted in making us send a large part of our forces into Asia to help the Turks to recapture Baghdad. It was necessary to come to an agreement, and the King and Radoslavoff openly expressed their dissatisfaction to the Germans. These were the circumstances in which William IPs journey became necessary, and it produced appreciable results. The Kaiser and Kilhlmann gave formal assurances to satisfy Bulgarian aspirations as stipulated in the previous treaty. They undertook, in addition, to put pressure on the Turks in making them understand that Turkey&apos;s interests are in Asia and not in Turkey.&quot;INDIA.The anjumankhuddam-i-Kaaba and the Pan-Turanian Movement.
