1SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT, No. XXVI.THE paper by Captain Willis and Captain Phillips, printed as an appendix to this report, is of first-rate importance. It opens a vista of possibilities which has perhaps not been hitherto considered. So far as is known, the native politics of Africa as a whole have never been considered before, and the paper jointly composed by these two officers shows the necessity of breaking down the barriers of &quot;the water-tight compartments in which our policies in various parts of the world are enclosed. It certainly would not have occurred to the average student that great opportunities would be offered the Germans and Turks in Africa, if they should come out of the war with any ray of prestige, on the lines that the papers indicate.However, when the paper is read in the light of German-Turkish policy in the Middle East, of the methods by which the Teuto-Turanian turns philosophic anarchy in Russia, democratic nationalism in Persia, and Socialism in Europe to his account, it will not be difficult to understand how he would work Ethiopian Christianity, Pan-Islamism, and &quot; Africa for the Africans &quot; in Africa. It is obvious that we should study the matter carefully, define our policy, and take steps in advance. If after the war we muddle and drift from situation to situation, and follow different aims in different areas, while our enemies think and act on consistent and definite lines, we shall be confronted with a black question of appalling magnitude ; there will be a prospect of those parts of Africa in which the black is really a political factor subsiding into a welter of anarchy.M. S.Russia.There can be little doubt that Kerensky has an uphill fight in front of him. Petrograd is teeming with German agents, and the mass of the Russian armies and people want peace at almost any price. He is faced with chaos within and a well-disciplined and organised foe without.A late press telegram contradicts the view expressed in No. IL13 (20th July) that the Ukraine business is settled satisfactorily. The Ukrainian Rada seems to have proclaimed its autonomy.Turkey.The extract from the &quot; Kibla&quot; is extremely interesting. The mainstay of the Khudam-i-Khaba, clearly a pro-Turk organisation, was Mohammed Ali, of Aligarh University, the Indian journalist, who made such frequent appearances in the lobbies of the House of Commons a few years ago.[898-53]
Aden.The Indian Government still seem fond of the Imam Yahya. It would be interesting, to know what grounds they have for thinking that the present Imam is &quot;the one really powerful influence in Southern Arabia.&quot; However, the Indian Government have already backed the Idrissi, and it is against the latter rather than against the Turk that the Imam now, somewhat late in the day, seeks our support.Before listening to the Imam, it might prove advantageous to obtain the opinion of our ally the King of the Hejaz on the ImanVs intentions and capacity.The transfer of political and military control of Aden from India to London has come most opportunely.W. 0.-G.   .July 27, 1917

On the L8th July the military attache telegraphed through Sir G. Buchanan [No. 1097] that on the previous day sailors from Kronstadt had arrested M. Chernov, and had been on the point of attacking the Duma. The situation was then critical, but it had suddenly taken a change for the better. M. Chernov had been released. Most of the regiments had signified their willingness to obey the Council; only three regiments had remained obdurate, the 1st machine gun and the 1st and 181st dep6t regiments. The streets were quiet, but the tramways were not running, and the bridges had been taken up. On the following day he telegraphed again [No. 1104] saying that the tramways were running, and Petrograd was outwardly quiet again. He was of opinion that it was necessary in the interests of Russia and of her allies that steps should be taken for the formation of some sort of police; for the disarmament of such units as were unreliable, and of all workmen ; for the establishment of a military censorship of the press ; for the punishment of the agitators who had organised the demonstration ; and for the re-estab-lishment of the death penalty in military law.Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 20th July that he had been informed by M. Terestchenko that there had been great difficulties in the Cabinet Council of the preceding day, and that it had looked as if M. Kerensky would have to leave the Government. A telegram announcing that the Germans had broken through the Russian army to the north of Halich, however, changed the situation. Prince Lvov resigned the presidency in favour of M. Kerensky on the ground that the latter was more in touch with the democracy and more active. This was agreed to and all of M. Kevensky&apos;s demands accepted that the Government should have complete executive control of the army, and that Lenin and his lieutenants should be arrested, and that[898-53] B
aa end should be put to the Bolshevi agitation. The &quot; Pravda&quot; had been suppressed ; steps were being taken to disband disloyal regiments ; and the Committee of Helsingfors sailors who had come to support the demonstration had been arrested.On the 21st July the military attache telegraphed [No. 1118] saying that during the night there had been heavy fighting on several occasions. On passing the Palace Bridge a. regiment from the front was fired on, but there were only ten casualties, twqg being killed. It looked as if no one was to be punished for taking part in. the lasif^ armed insurrection. Forty-eight hours after the Minister of Justice bad published in the press the details of the charge against them, it was decided to arrest the leading Bolsheviki on a charge of espionage ; only two have since been taken.On the same day Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 1119a] that there was a very strong feeling against the Bolsheviki. The publication of documents showing that Lenin and his associates were in German pay incensed the public, and the Government were severely criticised for having abstained for so long from divulging the information. But MM. Nekrasov and Terestchenko justified themselves by declaring that it was on\j pending the arrest of the accused that they had withheld the documents, and promised that there should be a most searching enquiry. On the other hand the Sovyet, which had certainly lost much prestige during the last few days, was suspected of a wish to burke enquiry for fear of compromising many of its members, though it had appointed a committee of five to examine the charges brought against Lenin.On the following day, telegraphing again [No. 1126], Sir G. Buchanan said that M. Terestchenko had informed him that it was only with the greatest difficulty that he and M. Nekrasov had been able to induce their Socialist colleagues to renounce the idea of a settlement of the land question and of the proclamation of a republic. He said, too, that the position of the Sovyet was no longer what it had been, and that a Socialist Minister now acted without referring to it for instructions.The military attache, telegraphing on the same day [No. 1127], said that the situation was decidedly better. The Grenadier depot battalion had been disarmed the night before, and other depot units would be disarmed and disbanded.On the 24th July Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 1135] that a combined sitting of the All-Russian Executive Committee of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Council and the Executive Committee of the AU-R,ussian Council of Peasants&apos; Delegates yesterday passed a resolution that the Government should be given unlimited authority to re-establish discipline in the army, to suppress anarchy in the rear, and realise the reform measures mentioned in the recent declaration. The Socialist Ministers were to report twice a week to the above-mentioned Executive Committees. (? Words omitted) appeared also addressed to all workmen, soldiers, sailors, and peasants to the effect that the revolution was in danger and the Government, renamed the Government of Public Safety, had been invested with dictatorial powers to restore order with an iron hand. Reinforcements and supplies were to be sent at once to the front. All Russians irrespective of class were to assist in restoring order. Warnings were issued against anti-Semitic and class agitation.M, Kerenshy as Dictator. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 23rd July [No. 1128] that M. Terestchenko had admitted that M. Kerensky was dictator in all but name. He, M. Kerensky, had returned the day before, and had informed his colleagues that he had empowered army commanders to shoot, without trial, all men who disobeyed orders ; the Council of Ministers approved his action.The Army and German Bribes. The military attache&apos; telegraphed on the 22nd July (No. 1122] that some 2.500 of the men of the 1st Machine Gun Regiment, all then in barracks, had surrendered on the px^previous day, and had been disarmed. The strength of the regiment, which before the revolution was 19,000 strong, had fluctuated, and it had not sent a man to the front. Ail the men who had been disarmed were found to be in possession of considerable sums of money, anything from 1,000 roubles down to 350 ; so in many cases soldiers at the front and in Finland had been noticed to be in jaossession of large sums. Before the war the Prussian Government ordered paper money from the German Government, and there could be but little doubt that the latter had been printing Russian money for cheap propaganda.Moscow. Sir G. Buchanan on the 23rd July forwarded [No. 1119] a telegram, which ha.d been sent on the 19th by the consul at Moscow, to the effect that the extremists had tried to organise an armed demonstration, but only fifty soldiers had taken part in it and it had been a complete failure. Demonstrations of every kind had been forbidden by the Sovyet.   All was then quiet in the city.
The Ukraine. In a telegram of the 20th July [No. 1113] Sir G. Buchanan said that he had been told by M. Terestchenko that the settlement of the Ukraine question, as reported in Sir G. Buchanan&apos;s telegram of the 16th July [Eastern Report XXV, p. 1],. had produced an excellent impression both in the Ukraine and in Petrograd.FINLAND.The Autonomy Bill [see Eastern Beporb XXY, p. 2]. Sir G. Buchanan, telegraph-ing on the 20th July [No. 1109], said that it&apos;was reported that the Finnish Diet had, the night before, passed the Autonomy Bill by 136 votes to 55. The minority, consisting of Swedish Young Finn parties, urged that the question of autonomy should be left till after the war, and till after the Finnish people had expressed their opinion, and deprecated taking undue advantage of the present difficulties of the Russian Government. The Socialist parties overruled their objections, and a proposal that the Bill should be submitted for confirmation to the Prussian Government was negatived by 104 votes to 86. The Senate resolved to resign, but finally agreed to remain until the Diet had organised the new Government. The national flag of Finland had been hoisted over the Diet and Senate buildings.Telegraphing again on the same day [No. 1113a], he said that he gathered from M. Terestchenko that the decision of the Finnish Diet would not be recognised by the Russian Government, which could, he said, count on the Russian troops in Finland to enforce its wishes.POLAND.General Situation. On the 21st July Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan [No. 1545], Lord Bertie [No. 1938], Sir R. Rodd [No. 1364], and Sir C. Spring-Rice [No. 2859], in regard to the situation in Poland, saying that it was clear, from such information as His Majesty&apos;s Government possessed of recent events in &quot;that country, that the situation therein had caused serious preoccupation to Germany and Austria. It seemed to His Majesty&apos;s Government that by all possible means the Poles should be encouraged to refuse all promises of a mock independence made by the Central Powers, which the sense of having been left to their fate by the Allies, combined with prolonged misery, might induce them to accept ; and generally they should be stiffened in their demand for independence and liberty. The change of Chancellors in Germany might foreshadow more drastic treatment of the Poles, and this made a move in the direction indicated all the more necessary. His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore suggested that the allied Governments should, each in its own country, henceforward openly recognise as friends and potential allies all Poles whether from Russian Poland, Galicia, or Posen. This would tend to bring home to public opinion in the allied countries the idea of an independent Polish nation and State, in addition to being an earnest to the Poles themselves that the allied Governments supported their claim. If a repre-sentative Polish committee were set up in each of the allied countries, it would further these ends. Such a committee, if approved by the Government, might be treated as the chief channel of communication, and might do considerable service by vouching individual Poles, recommending them to the protection of the Government, and, when necessary, giving them assistance. Lord Bertie, Sir R. Rodd, and Sir C. Spring-Rice were instructed to ascertain the views of the Governments to which they were accredited; and Sir G. Buchanan was informed that it was left to his discretion to choose a favourable moment for placing this suggestion of His Majesty&apos;s Government before that of Russia.Proposed Anglo-Polish Committee. Sir G. Buchanan, telegraphed on the 18th July [No. 1099] saying that M. Lednizki, president of the Mixed Commission for the liquidation of various Russo-Polish questions of a non-political character, had asked him to support him in forming an Anglo-Polish Committee to examine the economic situation in Poland, with a view to thwarting German penetration after the war. He said that M. Terestchenko approved his idea as to a Russo-Polish Committee. Sir G. Buchanan had asked the latter whether he saw any objection to an Anglo-Polish Committee such as M. Lednizki had proposed. His Excellency had replied in the negative, but said that it ought to be of a purely unofficial character, though he saw [group omitted : ? no] reason why our Commercial Attache .-hould not be a member of it in his private capacity. Sir G. Buchanan had toid M. Lednizki that he was in full sympathy with the object he had in view, but that he must consult Mr. Balfour first. If the latter approved he would tell him that there was no objection to his forming such a committee, provided that it had no official character.
RUMANIA.Feeling in regard to England. Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 16th July TNo. 372 ; only received on the 21st July] that he had received a visit from the Prime Minister, who had said that he had lately observed that English feeling was not altogether favourable to Roumania. He attributed this in part to Serbian complaints ; the Serbians, he thought, enjoyed more favour, in England than the Roumanians. Sir G. Barclay thought that lie was anxious in regard to the south-west corner of the Banat. that is to say, lest Serbia should arouse English sympathy in regard to her claim ; and that he had pointed out that the Rumanians were more numerous in the Widin district, even if there was a preponderance of Serbs in the other region.The New Cabinet. Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 23rd July [No. 382 ] that a coalition Cabinet had been formed owing to the efforts of the King. M. Take Jonesco became Vice-President of the Council, without a portfolio ; the Minister for War was replaced by a general, and became Minister of Munitions. M. Constantinesco remained in the Cabinet as Minister of the Interior and Food Controller. The Labour Party was not represented.TURKEY.The Turanian Movement. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 21st July [No. 767] a paragraph from No. 91 of the &quot; Kibla,&quot; which runs as follows : Amongst the papers that were found on the person of Shakib Ghalib Bey, commandant of the forces in Medina, who was killed in battle, was a sort of circular issued by the central committee of the society &quot; Tm-k Bugaghi,&quot; a well-known body having branches in all the villages and towns of Constantinople, Asia Minor, and all other provinces. The mission of that society is to spread the Turanian movement, and to cause oil Mahommedans to submit to its doctrines, which are directly against Islam. The circular runs thus :- -The fictitious chaos known as Pan-Islamism, which has long been an obstacle in the way of our progress and the realisation of our Turanian ideal, is now declining - and dis-appearing, and is no longer a danger to the objects we are endeavouring to attain. The state of Indian. Moslems testifies to that fact, for the Sunnis are the strongest sect amongst them, and we have succeeded in engaging some of them in our service under the veil of &quot; The Servants of the Holy Temple (Khudham-i-Kaaba).&quot; These people are really devoted to our cause, and do all they can to defend us, and are quite able to convince their Indian brethren that white is black and black white. So&apos;let members of our society do away with any reserve, or secrecy in promoting our mission and let them fear no longer the resistance of the Moslem world.Sir R. Wingate added that he was trying to obtain the original circular.Chances of a Revolution. A trustworthy agent was told in a well-informed quarter that practically there was no chance of a revolution in Turkey, although great discontent existed throughout the Empire; the opposition, he was told, really counted for very little.ALGERIA.Military Service Agreement. Lord Bertie telegraphed on the 19th July [No. 695] that Algeria was regarded as part of France, so that it was to be presumed that when the Anglo-French agreement was made the French Government would apply it in Algeria to British subjects of military age.ABYSSINIA.Expulsion of Germans. Mr. Tiiesiger telegraphed on the 17th July with reference to his telegram of the 2nd July [Eastern Report XXIII, p. 6] that Ras Taffari had added a fifth condition, namely, that Abyssinia should be guaranteed by the three Powers the possession of such properties in Jerusalem as were recognised to be hers before the war. Mr. Thesiger recommended the acceptance of this condition, which, he said, referred principally to monasteries.ARABIA.Hejaz.Prayers for the Sultan. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 17th July [No. 751] saying that Colonel Wilson had been informed that the Sultan of Turkey was no longer mentioned, either by title or name, in the Friday prayers at Mecca. At Jeddah, too, the prayer for the Sultan would in the future be omitted.
Asir.Said Mustaffa. The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 20th July [411 A.P.] saying that Said Mustaffa would probably leave for Jaizan about the 24th July. [See Eastern Report XXII, p. 4, and XXV, p. 5.]Aden.Change of Control. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir R. Wingate on the 24th July [No. 745] informing him that, in order to secure proper direction of our military effort in the Aden district, with proper support for it and unity of conti*ol, it had been decided by His Majesty&apos;s Government to place the G.O.C. under the control of the War Office in military matters. It was also thought desirable to secure similar co-ordination of political action by transferring political control to London, the G.O.C. Aden, in his capacity as political resident, being subordinate, for the period of the war, not to the Government of India but to the High Commissioner in Egypt. The whole question would be reconsidered after the war. If an Indian officer with special knowledge were attached to the High Commissioner the difficulty arising from the fact that the Govern-ment of India was the better informed with our previous political relations at Aden and with our negotiations with local tribes might be overcome. For this purpose Colonel Jacob could be sent rto Cairo.PERSIA.Suggested Deputation to Parliament and the Duma. -Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 21st, July l No. 255] that he had discouraged a scheme of which he had been informed by the Prime Minister, namely, that it was intended to send a joint delegation to Parliament and the Duma, the delegation being composed of the former Medjliss. On the 24th July Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 203] approving his action.The Bakhtiari. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 19th July [No. 254] saying that he had just been informed that Sirdar Zafar had been appointed Ilkhani and Sirdar Ashja Ilbegi. The tribal custom was to select the Ilkhani alternately from each of the two branches of the tribe ; and the khans in Tehran excused the present appoint-ment on the ground that just now no other was possible without going contrary to the custom, but they admitted that the arrangement was unlikely to last.INDIA.N. W. Frontier Province. The Viceroy, telegraphing on the 20th and 23rd July, said that a very satisfactory settlement had been effected with the Mohmands, and the blockade, which had been maintained since last September, had been raised. Also that the date for the final settlement with the Mahsuds had been postponed for a few days ;. ihey were still collecting the rifles which were to be sui-rendered.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.RUSSIA.Internal Situation. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 24th July [No. 11371 that in the course of a conversation with M. Terestchenko the latter had said that all danger of organised action on the part of the Bolshevicki was over, though individuals among them might still have recourse to acts of terrorism; also that the prosecution of persons in German pay was being actively pushed on. In reply to a question as to whether the pacifist movement would be strengthened by the recent reverse, M. Terestchenko said that in the country it had brought home to the country the necessity for going on with the war, and had put an end to peace talk.On the following day he telegraphed [No. 1142] that all the Russian frontiers would be closed for three weeks from the 27 th July, both for exit and entry. Only those holding diplomatic 2Jassports and those travelling on urgent business would be allowed to pass ; for the latter class applications for exemption should be made- by their embassies. &quot;The object of this was to give the Provisional Government a chance to re-establish the control of persons passing the frontiers. Sir G. Buchanan said, that he welcomed the measure, as the country had been flooded with German agents and spies since the Revolution.[898-53] C   &apos;
. POLAND.General Situation. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 24th July [No. 1138] that he had spoken to M. Terestchenko on the proposal contained in Mr, Balfour&apos;s telegram of the 21st July [supra, p. 3], and had found that he would not welcome its immediate adoption. Until the Finnish question had been settled he was unwilling that any step should be taken that might encourage other races to put forward claims to independence. For some time past, however, the Russian Government had treated all Poles on an equal footing, whether they were Russian, German, or Austrian ; but recently there had been reason for dissatisfaction with their attitude. One Polish division had gone over to the enemy, and another had refused to take the offensive. An agitation, too, had been started in favour of incorporating Lithuania in the Poland of the future; and a group of Poles had encouraged the Finns in their demind for independence. -Proposed Anglo-Polish Committee. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan on the 25th July [No. 1564] approving the action proposed in the last paragraph of his telegram of the 18th July [supra, p. 3].ARABIA.Yemen.Proposals made by the Imam. The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 20th July [409 A.P.] that the Imam had sent a shaykh of the Beni Siham with proposals for an agreement. He was prepared to enter into one on certain conditions, the chief of which were that Idrisi should be removed from Arabia; that the British Government should only communicate with the Yemeni through the Imam or with his knowledge ; that all seaports in Yemen which belonged to his predecessors should be given to him ; and that he should have all Yemen from Halli Point southwards, including Asir and Hadramaut, with the sole exception of Aden. The envoy claimed that all the tribes were content with the Imam, and that the latter could at, once call up the whole of Yemen.The Resident regarded these terms as preposterous, and thought that the Imam, knowing that the confederacy had approached us, and realising that his hold on Yemen was failing, wished to delay action on our part. He suggested replying that all territorial questions must wait till the end of the war ; that Idrisi was our ally; and that the Imam had been already informed as to the terms on which his co-operation was desired.The, Viceroy, telegraphing on the 23rd July in regard to this, expressed the opinion that it would be a serious mistake to rebuff the Imam, whose overtures were highly significant, though his conditions as the)&apos;&apos; stood were obviously impossible. The Imam&apos;s co-operation would be invaluable to us now and hereafter, for his was the one really powerful influence in Southern Arabia. The Viceroy suggested that a reply should be sent to the effect that our first object at present was the ejection of the Turks from Arabia, and we would gladly hereafter try to secure a satisfactory settlement between the Imam and his neighbours if he would assist us in this immediate object; we welcomed the present evidence of his desire to come to an agreement with us, but he must understand that we could not throw over faithful friends or intervene in the quairels of Arabs among themselves.Aden.Change of Control. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 25th July [No. 786], in reply to Mr. Balfour&apos;s telegram of the 24th [supra, p. 5], that he should welcome Colonel Jacobs presence in Cairo ; he considered the alteration decided upon as being in the best interests of the Empire.PERSIA.Disorderly Conduct of Russian Troops. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 19th July [No. 253] that on account of the local traders at Kasvan having refused to accept the depreciated rouble, Russian troops had looted the bazaars of that place, just as they had done a few weeks since at Urumia. In regard to this the Foreign Office telegraphed on the 25th July [No. 1569] that it had been informed by the Persian Minister that the Russian troops in Persia were becoming a direct menace to the internal situation, and that in consequence his Government was urging the withdrawal of Russian troops. These excesses, which gave the Persian authorities an occasion to demand the withdrawal of the troops, occasioned risk to the allied cause, and Sir G. Buchanan was instructed to represent this unofficially, if necessary, to the Russian Government.
APPENDIX.Religious-Political Situation in the Sudan and East Africa.Memorandum prepared by Captain C. A. Willis, A.D.I., Sudan Government, and Captain J. E. Phillips, Intelligence Department, East Africa Force, after a Conversation with Sir Mark Syhes.1. The general subject-matter of the conversation was the probable policy of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government towards the colonies and dependencies on the East of Africa, with special reference to the Sudan, Uganda, British East Africa, and German East Africa, and any possible adumbrations of the administrative steps that that policy might necessitate.2. German East Africa, if it remained in the hands of the Germans after the war, would not only provide a menace to the neighbouring colonies of the British Empire, but as an easy submarine base against India would threaten a still wider sphere, and it was therefore assumed that, for purposes of general policy, German East Africa could be considered as a part of the British Empire.3. A general survey of the area under consideration shows two large Mohammedan populations, separated by Uganda, where there is a considerable Christian population and a number of pagan tribes, extending in all directions beyond the limits of Uganda, whose tendency is to adopt Islam with ease and enthusiasm. There is therefore a considerable field for Mohammedan propaganda, and the possibility of a wide movement towards Pan-Islamism in the near future makes it desirable to define the Government policy towards Islam in these parts and to take steps to adopt suitable measures in anticipation.4. In respect to Pan-Islam the British Government is confronted with a dilemma : either to pose as a great Mohammedan Power herself, and to exercise a direct&apos;influence in affairs of Islam, or to maintain an attitude of tolerance in matters of religion, and to counteract the Pan-Islamic propaganda by suitable measures. The former policy that of Disraeli has been already tried and found wanting, partly from the inconsistency naturally inherent in a Christian Power posing as a Mohammedan and partly from the ineptitude of the results obtained. The second policy therefore seemed the more desirable.5. It is a characteristic of Islam to attempt to unite different nations under the one religious flag as if they were a single nationalitj7. Such a policy is only possible if there is a strong guiding hand at the head of Mohammedan affairs with a comparatively weak national feeling in the different units forming the whole. The proper check, therefore, to Pan-Islam is (1) a weak central Government, with do more than a spiritual ascendancy over Mohammedans outside its territories, and (2) a strong national feeling in every Mohammedan coutrtiw, which would make the population more interested in the political and commercial development of their own country than in the Pan-Islamic principle.The first of these means to check Pan-Islam seems to be met by the establishment of an Arab kingdom. It will hold the holy places and be technically adequate to maintain the Caliphate. But the poverty of the kingdom, the ignorance amongst the Arabs of modern methods of both trade and warfare, their natural conservatism, and their low standard of mental, moral, and physical activity, induced by generations of inbreeding, combine to make it probable that the kingdom will not bear much weight in the councils of the world.The second means requires a somewhat detailed examination. In Egypt there is a nationalist party largely engineered by self-seeking newspaper proprietors. Theie is also a far more important section of educated Egyptian opinion which has considerable motions towards nationalism but is rendered inarticulate because they will not identify themselves with the newspaper nationalists, whom they know to be dishonest, and they will not ask assistance from the British, whose presence they deplore. There should be no difficulty in developing a national feeling in Egypt, though it will be far more difficult to control it. In the Sudan the greater part is inhabited by Arabs and Sudanese, who are all Mohammedans; and there is amongst some sections of the more intelligent natives a growing desire to take pact in their own administration and to be rid of the mediation of the Egyptian, who has hitherto filled all the lesser administrative positions.   During the war the dislike of the Egyptian on the part of the natives of the[R98-53] D
Sudan has become much more apparent, and with, it a desire to elaborate the Sudan custom in language, education, and manner of life. A tentative suggestion was put forward recently to make an experiment in giving certain quasi-judicial and adminis-trative powers to some selected natives, and it is possible that this idea might be followed up. The formation of a strong national feeling in the Sudan would take some years, and would require careful handling and far-seeing administration, but it is not, impossible. In the south, where the negro or negroid population is mainly pagan, the^ people are too primitive to have a conscious feeling of nationality, and although some tribes are both united and organised others are only organised locally, whilst some.seem to possess no internal control of any lasting value. The same may be said of a large part of British East Africa. It is these fairly populous tracts of pagan population that form a fertile field for proselytism to Islam. Very little, if any, interference with native custom is involved by such conversion, but the negro turned Mohammedan is a fiercer and more fanatical upholder of the faith than the more educated Arab. In German East Africa there is already a considerable Mohammedan population, and there is a tendency from the coast upwards for the educated classes to embrace Islam. In the course of the war there has been an unprecedented mixing of representatives of almost all the black races of Africa, Nigerian Ptegiment, Gold Coast Regiment, Hausa porters, Cape boys, Zulus, Matabili, &amp;c, meeting Sudanese, Azande, Bagandes, Somalis, and all the local tribes. &quot; Liberal &quot; ideas from the Cape and Sierra Leone have been discussed over the camp fires and a good deal of rather vague political generalisation has been implanted in minds ill adapted to digest the matter or to use it properly. Especially has the doctrine of &quot;Africa for the African&quot; taken definite form as an ideal in the minds of many. This is also a tenet of the Ethiopian Church and tends to spread from Rhodesia and Nyassaland into German East Africa. It is of Christian origin, but it gave some evidence of its tendencies early in the war when the natives slaughtered several white settlers and held a kind of &quot;black mass &quot; over their mutilated bodies. Whether or no the &quot; Ethiopian &quot; Church is an offshoot of the Ethiopian Church of Abyssinia, this tenet of &quot; Africa for the Africans &quot; has its adherents in great force in Abyssinia, and the possibility of the spread of the doctrine from this region as well cannot be overlooked.Thus, apart from the dangers of Pan-Islam, there is a possibility of the nationalist feeling being tainted by this very dangerous doctrine if it is allowed to creep in from the south or east. Moreover, the doctrine can be applied to Mohammedans, and although admittedly a I turkish Jehad would find few followers, an African Jehad would be widely acceptable and would be likely to spread in a very alarming manner.The position therefore becomes more complicated. For whilst the nominally Christian and pagan tribes&apos; of Uganda and the Southern Sudan form the natural insulators between the Mohammedan populations north and south of them, there is some danger of the &quot;nationalist &quot; theory, if developed, leading to disaster. This is due not only to the &quot;Africa for the Africans&quot; ideal, but the Baganda, who form the strength and aristocracy of the &quot;insulating&quot; section, can recall the days when they led a great confederacy of native tribes uncontrolled by any white nation.Furthermore, the &quot; insulation&quot; is not complete. Owing to a rigid insistence on the part of the Church Missionary Society on the doctrine of monogamy, in 1914 anti-Christian spirit showed itself in the destruction of native teachers&apos; houses and numbers of Baganda either reverted to paganism, embraced Islam, or emigrated. In 1915 a new sect started by one Malaki gained enormous numbers of converts. This sect,* while nominally Christian in enjoining baptism and various Christian virtues, permits polygamy and is markedly anti-European [e.g., forbids the use of any European drugs or medicine), and its followers -showed a tendency to adopt the theory that they might as well try the Germans, under w-hose regime they hoped to find smaller demands for labour and a lower tax.Again, in German East Africa the temper of the Mohammedan natives is alienated from British rule since they have been taught by the Germans that the British are responsible for the anti-slavery treaties and the Germans only carried them out to the letter, winking at the maintenance of old methods under the guise of labour contracts. That the Germans were beginning to find Arab, i.e., Mohammedan influence too strong and intended to take steps to reduce it is shown by the Moshi papers. They had originally made use of a number of refugee Mahdists from the Sudan, and other Mohammedans had been enlisted by Karl Peters from the Sudan, and with their aid they had cowed the native population. These Mohammedans, however, became too numerous and powerful, and the object of the policy outlined in the Moshi papers was* This must not be confused with the Sunni Malaki School.
either to make the Mohammedans innocuous by accepting such terms or to compel them to emigrate. The policy, however, was never carried into effect, and the Mohammedan population looks on the British as the opponents of their normal system of domestic slavery and is sullen and irresponsive.In view of the dangers and difficulties arising from either a Christian or Mohammedan education (the former owing to the. Christian attitude to polygamy, 4$ the latter owing to its tendency to acquire political with spiritual ascendency) it would seem desirable to establish secular schools in those parts where possible. This has been tried with success by the Germans, and it is notable that the term &quot;Kaffir&quot; in Uganda implies lack of education, since all schools there have a definite religious tone.In conclusion, it appears that the policy of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government in this area should be to the development of national feeling within its natural divisions, to develop deliberately the &quot; insulating area&quot; between the great Mohammedan populations, to restrain by means of religious toleration and secular education the inroads of religious fanaticism of whatever origin, and to prepare the way for intelligent participation by the natives in their own administration and self-control within the limits of their nation.PRINTED AT THE FOBBIGW OTFlCB BY C.

ARABIA.Hejaz.Intelligence.Little news has come in concerning the operations of the four sons of. the King of the Hejaz. Slierif Feisal lias now moved inland from Wejh and, if all goes well, may be expected to join issue with the Turks near El Ula about the middle of the month. It is more than likely that the latter have got wind of his movements, and already there have been indications that the El Ula area is being reinforced. The scarcity of water is likely to cause some trouble to the Arabs.Information received by way of Jeclda from an Egyptian who escaped from Medina about the middle of May is mostly confirmatory of what has already been recorded in these pages. Informant places the civilian population of Medina at a lower figure than had hitherto been reported and states that there were only between 500 to 1,000 men, all of whom had been retained by the military authorities for labour purposes. The food supplies he reckoned sufficient for one year for the present garrison and reduced number of inhabitants. This is being supplemented by the sowing of grain in the gardens north of the town, which will maintain 500 people. Water is plentiful both outside the town and within. Supplies continue to arrive from the north at irregular intervals and four or five camel loads had been brought in by the Arabs from the AVest. This is interesting, as showing that some of the supplies sent by us to the Arabs are finding their way into wrong hands. This is inevitable once the supplies are distributed to the tribal groups, but there is nothing to show that it is taking place on any large scale, The Arabs have been allowed to come with their camels quite close to Medina in order to remove refugees, and surreptitious smuggling is probably not a difficult matter. The King of the Hejaz places the blame on Idrisi dhows, which are alleged to be landing unauthorised cargoes. Informant states that there are twenty-six fortified posts round the town. All the surrounding hills have, been occupied, the strongest force being on Jebel Jehannum, which is the key to the whole position. The Mosque of Haroun is being used as a store for food, supplies and a machine gun has been placed in the minaret.The Howeitat in the neighbourhood of Maan have recently broken into active revolt and have already caused considerable embarrassment to the enemy. Fighting began by attacks on the same clay against El Fuwella on the Akaba-iMaan road, resulting in the communications between these two places being cut, and against Meriga, where twelve Turks were killed, including Capt. Ahmed Hikmet, 0.0. Cavalry Squadron, and one gun was captured.   A grazing patrol was also set upon at Ain el Jerbah,
Lieut. -Oulonei Neweombes Report.Colonel Newcombe sends a report of his recent movements to June 23.Preceded by Lieut. Hornbj^ with thirty Egyptians and an Indian party of four machine-guns, lie left Wejh on June 1-1 by car, joining Lieut. Hornby at Beda the same evening. The going was good as far as Abu Gazaz, after which he had to push the car through sand for some miles. He moved off on the 16th, reaching Tefiha (unidentified on the map) on the 18th, where he found Khaled Effendi with 110 men. Being informed that there was water at El Righai he made his way there with the intention of proceeding next day to Tharba, but on reaching El Righai found no water and had to go instead to Ansheifa, with the idea of going on to Gharib and attacking the railway thence. A further report reaching hi in, however, (hat the water was short at Gharib, caused him to return to Tefiha and try another route to Tharba via Urish, by which the water was said to be ample,near Shobek, but succeeded in escaping&apos; with the loss of one mail wounded and five animals killed. Following on this, the movement has spread south. Hails have been blown up in the neighbourhood of. Gaclir el Haj station, and a repair gang of fourteen men was attacked near Tell el Shah in station, suffering losses of one Turk killed, three- wounded and eight captured. The telegraph line near Wadi Retim has been damaged and fighting has occurred in the neighbourhood. The telegraph wires and instruments have also been destroyed at Fawira, a place not yet identified, and the Mainur of the place has been killed. The Arabs appear to have their headquarters at Bair wells to the north-east of Milan, where they have reopened the wells. The full extent of the revolt is not yet known, nor whether the Howeitat only arc participating&quot;, but the results already achieved have proved a very timely diversion and must have distracted the attention of the Turks from the Arab preparations further south.Further reports from Sherif Zeid about his fight with the forces of Ibn Rashid, mentioned on page 291 above, show that the enemy convoy was larger than was at first supposed. Sherif Zeid claims to have captured four mountain guns, more than 200 rifles with a large quantity of ammunition, o,000 loaded camels, including Ibn Leilah&apos;s riding camel, a further herd of camels, including 200 untrained she-camels, and Ibn RashicTs standards. The enemy&apos;s losses in killed, described&apos; at first in one of the Emir&apos;s letters as &quot; of a number innumerable,&quot; are now placed at seventy-six, including the brother of Ghalib Bey, Commandant of Medina.
though the road very hill)&apos;. At Ten ha, on June 22, he heard that the Turks were reported to have filled in the wells at Tharba and at Shellal, and that probably there is no water near the line, except at El Derm, near Moadhdham and at places near Kalaat ura Zumrudd. Lieut. Hornby was sent on to Tharba to make sure, but if. the reports prove true, the projects of attacking the line between Medain Saleh and El Ula will have to be abandoned.The Northward Move.Report reaches us from Wejh, under elate June 30, as follows : &quot; Andeh abu X^yyeh arrived at Kasr el Azrak, and many Arabs have come to him to submit loj^alty and to fight under the flag which was given to.him by H.E. Sherif Feisal with Sherif Nasir, Nasib el Bakry and Captain Lawrence.The Turkish Government hearing that Audeh had joined the Sherifs army, sent a force and destroyed El Gifa wells (Wells east of Maan.) knowing that Audeh will make this place his headquarters.&quot;This is the first news we have had of the doings of Abu Tayyeh since he started north with Captain Lawrence, Sherif N.asir and Nasib el-Bakry.. Kasr el-Azrak is east of Salt, about 120 miles north of the Jafar depression (El Gifa, above). It is doubtful whether we should understand that Captain Lawrence is with him there, or whether in fact the party, after showing itself in the north, lias returned to the Maan district and is now directing the operations of the Howeitat, elsewhere reported, whose activity without this direction it is difficult to account for.SYRIA.Attack on the Ansariyah.We are able to supplement the information about the Ansariyah given in No. 54 of the Bulletin by further reports just received to the effect that, on May 26, Aziz Bey, Commandant of Gendarmerie at Latakiya, left with 300 to 400 men to attack the Kalbiah (see pp. 281 &amp; 284) refractories. They entered the villages of Bostan Pasha and Ibrahim Ma.kb.luf, pillaged everything they could lay hold of, violated the women, and sent a few shepherds as prisoners to Jebele.If the Ansariyah are anything like as numerous and brave as they are reported (the Kalbiah section are stated to be able to
muster some 8,000 rifles), it is not clear why they showed&apos;&apos; no fight, especially as they are supposed to be particularly sensitive in the matter of their women. They seem, however, to have limited themselves to assuming a threatening attitude and refusing offers made by Aziz to their chiefs to treat with him. Aziz is said to have established himself in the village of Batra (?) and to have telegraphed  or reinforcements to Jemal, who replied that he could not spare a man and that Aziz should try to arrange the matter amicably. The troops are reported to have stayed on in Batra, robbing the neighbouring villages of sheep, fowls, and anything else they can lay their hands on. A French trawler which fired some shots is said to have much frightened Aziz and to have filled the Ansariyah with hopes of coming Allied assistance.AFGHANISTANThe Anvils views on, the situation.Although only the last paragraph of the following is strictly within our field, we include it as showing the effect of probable German propaganda on a friendly Moslem Sovereign.A Durbar was held at Kabul on May 26, 1917, at which the Amir is reported to have referred to the war with more freedom than usual. His remarks are summarised by the British Agent in Kabul as follows : &quot; Briefly, he said the Avar was very fierce on the French front, where the Germans had recently recaptured a few positions from the Anglo-French forces, but no decisive sign was yet in sight. America had also entered into the war on the side of the Allies, but it would take long before the martial energies of the nation revived and came into action to the advantage of the Allies, because America has long been addicted to internal peace, policy and civilisation of a high order, and consequently their genius or spirit of fighting as a nation or of military capability was totally extinct, and her intervention in the war was intentionally caused and sought by Germany for two reasons : (a) because America could have otherwise attained so high a position, in commerce economy, and wealth, by remaining a source of supply of war materials to the Allies during the war, as to make it absolutely impossible for Germany to compete with her for centuries after the war ; and (b) because by plunging America in the same trouble as Germany was herself suffering from, the former would be deprived of all chance of making any advance in her own social life as well as of continuing to bo a source of contribution to the Allies.
Referring to the state of affairs in Russia, though the news of the change of the principle of Government in the country came quite abruptly and suddenly, yet the causes that led to this result had existed for about a year and a. half, or so. The Amir reminded the audience of his prophecy which he said he had once made in public Durbar during the progress of the Russo-Japanese War, regarding the existence and germination of the spirit of the democratic principle of Government. This principle, he said, had now burst out in full strength and had overthrown the monarchy at such a critical time, with results as yet unknown. From the conflicting and contradictory reports in the Anglo-Indian papers His Majesty the Amir drew the inference, as his own personal opinion, that Russia would probably sign a separate peace with Germany. If this was so, such a separate peace would inevitably cause the Germans to redouble their activity.The Kazi-ul-Kuzat, speaking to the British Agent, expressed his great indignation at the separation of the Arabs from the Turks which, according to him, was due to the intrigues of the British and the French, and exhibited his fear that the Allies would interfere with the sacred cities of the Hejaz and that the British Government would occupy all the seaports of Arabia.&quot;NOTES.Mesopotamia.It is reported from Baghdad that Fahacl ibu Hadhdhal, who exercises great influence over the Anazeh tribes between Baghdad and Damascus, has thrown in his lot entirely with us. He is paramount chief of the Amarat, owning palm gardens near Kerbelah, Hit and elsewhere on the Euphrates. His tents number about 3,000 and he could probably put into the field from 1,500 to 2,000 men, armed and mounted on camels, with a small proportion of horses. If his influence results in the co-operation, of the other Anazeh tribes, his adhesion is of importance as facilitating communications between Baghdad and Syria should this latter be desired.He is an old man, who normally does not concern himself with internal politics, but who detests the Turks, having suffered imprisonment at their hands.Eejaz.A detachment of Sherif Abdul;a&apos;s army has captured a mail coming from El Moadhclham for Ibn Rashid. It contained telegrams from Sherif Haidar (at Damascus) and Enver Pasha to Ibn Rashid, congratulating him on joining his army to defeat the rebels. This tends to confirm the report that Ibn Rashid was present at the recent engagement with Zeid&apos;s forces.From the first attempt at organised military intelligence obtained through an Arab Intelligence Officer we hear that twenty to forty rails are kept at ever)&apos; station,  3,000 rails being
at Medina, and 100 to 200 at El Ula and Medain Saleh. There is no water at most of the stations, and it is brought to them by means of the trains. Most of the wells near the line have been destroyed by the Turks.Under date July 4, we hear that a detachment, under Lieut. Zemori, of the Spaliis, has blown up for a length of about ten metres a viaduct north of Mektum and destroyed several lengths ot&quot; rails to the west ( ?) of it. It is not possible to locate Mektum, but it is presumed to be in the area where Sherif Ali is operating, just north of Medina, he being the only one of the Sherifian brothers known to have any Spain officers attached.Some chiefs of the Beni Atiyeh and some of the Ibn Jazi sections of the Howeitat have arrived at Dhabah. It may be remembered that Hamicl ibn Jazi, chief of this section, who was recently decorated by the Turks, was reported some time ago as having announced his allegiance to the Sherif. It is believed that he has not been concerned on either side in the recent operations round Maan.On June 24, Sherif Feisal stated he had received a letter from Sherif Mohammed Ali at Dhabah, saying that an Arab, who had come in from the North, reported that Captain Lawrence with Sherif Nasr arid Aucleh Abu Tayyeh had gone north towards Jebel Druz and that he had destroyed a very high bridge near Maan. Sherif Feisal pointed out that this was only an Arab rumour and possibly not true.It is stated that, after the defeat of Ibn Rashid by Sherif Zeicl, some of the Shammar chiefs joined Sherif Abdullah&apos;s forces, including Ibn Ajil. If this is Aqabibn Ajil, one of the principal Abdah Sheikhs and grand-uncle of Ibn liashid, the report of his death received some time ago (see p. 203) is incorrect.Paper Money in Syria.The Turks appear to be enforcing their threats of punish-ment of those who contribute to the depreciation of their paper money by exchanging it for less than its due value. Recently, at Beirut, the police gave one of their secret agents L.T. 400 in paper for the purpose of changing it into gold. He eventually changed it at a jeweller&apos;s shop at the rate of 25&apos;5 piastres to the Turkish pound. Five hours afterwards the jeweller was arrested by the police and asked to explain the transaction. After having been soundly thrashed, he admitted the transaction and, when he was ordered to give up the notes, said that he had already sold them to some one else, who had in turn sold them to a third person and so on.   Seven persons were successively arrested.The following current prices are reported : L.T.1 paper money 25 25-5 piastres. 1 mark 5  fro     ,,1 krone 2-2-5    ,,
Bombardment of Aqaba.The &quot; Slieve Foy&quot; has visited Magnah (Gulf of: Aqaba) and found the tribes there friendly, and was informed that the tribes east and north were friendly also. She then visited Aqaba, saw no Turks in. the vicinity, but bombarded it. A report has been received that the Sherif of Moweilah is assembling Arabs for the purpose of attacking Aqaba, and the &quot; Slieve Foy &quot; will try and verify this at Eynunah on. her way south.Bombardment of Hodeidah.Two Englishmen and 200 British Indian prisoners having been located at Hodeidah in a deplorable condition by the Red Sea patrol, a naval force was landed on, June 28 from the patrol ship north of the town and the release of the prisoners was demanded under threat of bombardment. On the Turkish governor refusing to treat in any way, the ships bombarded and destroyed most of the Government and military buildings. On June 80, some Turkish guns fired back but did no damage, while the ships replied, starting a large fire ashore.On July 6, all civilian inhabitants were reported to have left, while 200 or 300 soldiers, some of whom are believed to come from the Iclrisi front, and a larger gun are reinforcing the garrison. The ships meanwhile remain. The governor has been warned that he will be held personally responsible for the good treatment of the prisoners.Hodeidah is a centre of trade for smaller towns, and considerable business is done there. It has been a mainstaj&apos; to the Turks, who obtained a local loan of  10,000 in June. The Governor of Hodeidah complained to the Wali, previously to the bombardment, that the patrol ships&apos; activities were causing the richer merchants to leave the place and. that there was a tendency among the inhabitants to panic. It may be hoped that a continuance of these activities will deter the resumption of business and that Turkish finances will suffer accordingly.Yemen News.The unrest against the Turks and the Imam appears to be spreading, owing to an event that Aden informs us may influence the future of the Yemen to a great extent, namely, the beheading by the former of Naqib Hassan Abu Ras, a prominent member of Dim Mohammed, the chief section of the Bekil -tribe. He was a friend of the Imam Yahya and an official under him, acting also as a tax-collector for the Turks. As it is thought the Turks would not have ventured on this step without the acquiescence of the Imam, he also is involved, and the opinion is that it will lead to a general rising against both him and the Turks. The Hashid and Bekil are said to be seeking vengeance, and Bias Bey, Kaimmakam of Ibb, is being reinforced by a few
Turks from Sabar and Waht to help him against them. The adherents of Abu Has are also reported to be fighting Mohammed Nasir Muqbil, who, according to a Lahej rumour, is responsible for the killing of Said Ahmed Pasha of Taiz, and who.has had to withdraw fifty of his Arabs from Lahej in consequence.Aden informs us that negotiations are in progress between Seyyid Mohammed Darwish, of Riyashia, in the Qatabali district, who revolted against the Turks about a month ago (see p. 272), Seif el Islam Mohammed el Mutawwakil, a relative of the [mam and one of his chief generals and advisers, and Seyyid Mohammed Yahya ibn el Hadi. (see pp. 254, where he is called Seyyid Mohammed el Qasiin, and 286), who, it appears, is the father of the new claimant to the Imamate and not, as we thought, the claimant himself, whose name is Yahya. Seyyid Mohammed was, however, the writer of the. letter to the Resident, Aden, mentioned on page 255. Seif el Islam was recently reported as occupying the Haclaa district up to the borders of Yafa with an Imamite force of 1,500 men, operating against the Juben, Nawa and Rubiatein. His defection from the Imam to&quot; Seyyid Mohammed may be expected to have far-reaching results.A report, which is considered reliable, has been received at. Aden that the Turks are taking steps to re-occupy Salif. They are said to have moved a small force from Loheiyab towards Salif, and some 250 men with four maxims from Jarb, of whom some were approaching Salif on -June 20. According to another report, which the().C. Kainaian considers reliable but exaggerated, 2,000 Arabs and a few Turks with them, are concentrating at Khoba to attack Salif.Aden Aews.Letters received at Aden from Radian state that Seyyid Mohammed Darwish, in preparation for an attack on Qataba, has collected a large force at Jebel Murus and has warned the Radfan tribesmen to hold themselves in readiness.The Alawi Sheikh&apos;s son writes that, owing to recent casualties, the Turks at Lahej are demoralised, and realise that if thev left thev would be-killed in the Yemen.Abdul Qaclir, grandson of the Fadhli Sultan, has sent in a letter from Ah Said Pasha to the Sultan, referring to our recent raid into the Fadhli country (see p. 243), and describing our action as cowardly and intended merely to frighten women and children. The Pasha asks for accurate information as to our intention to station troops in the country so that he can despatch a force and capture them. Abdul Qadir, who recently made an appeal to us in hopes of getting his old grandfather restored to favour, as he is on the verge of the grave, now says that he finds the Sultan cannot dissociate himself from the Turks, whom he has invited to come and live at bis capital.
