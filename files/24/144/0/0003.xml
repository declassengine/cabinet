SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT, No. XXVIII.Russia.   [Page 1.]The account of the recent ministerial crisis should be read with care, it is incapable of summary. The best that can be said is that it shows a growing tendency towards a desire for government in place of anarchy.Poland.   [Page 4.]The concurrence of the French Government in the view of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the Poles, as a whole, should be regarded as potential allies marks the starting point of a new Polish situation.Rumania.   [Page 4.]It is probable that the Central Powers will begin to take full political advantage of the military situation shortly.Turkey.   (C.U.P. Intrigues.)   [Page 6.]Tala&apos;at&apos;s terms are deserving of the closest study, as they show the working of the mind of the Committee of Union and Progress. It must be remembered that the objects of the Committee have hitherto been to ensure for the Ottoman Government 1. A powerful military position in the world.2. Full opportunity to crush and massacre small subject races.3. Pan-Islamic and parf-Turanian expansion in Central Asia, India, and Africa.4. Facilities for promoting dissensions among the Powers.Tala&apos;at&apos;s letter was obviously based on these fundamental principles, and, equally obviously, it was intended to reach British eyes. It must be remembered, in reading this communication, that Tala&apos;at&apos;s policy is to menace and bully, and that he probably counts on his own courage and on his enemies&apos; timidity as two of his greatest assets.Taken as a whole, the terms amount to this : 1. The Armenian and Arab problems are to be solved by reforms and constitutional changes, the usual Turkish prelude to extended massacres.2. Great Britain is to betray the King of Hejaz and the Arabs, in return for which the. Committee of Union and Progress is to give its benediction to British rule in India.3. The cosmopolitan financiers are to reassemble at Constantinople, thus putting a world-lever in the hands of the Ottoman Government.However, considering that there is nothing like intimidation, Tala&apos;at adds that these terms are no longer open, as Turkey intends to make a separate peace with Russia -and concentrate on driving the British out of Mesopotamia.There are two points which should be noticed in this matter :  1. That the Committee of Union and Progress have for the last two months been setting every possible agent in motion to get the Entente Powers to talk about a peace with Turke)^. [898-55]
2. That the Committee of Union and Progress have made a great parade of their intended Turco-Gerraan attack on Baghdad.It is manifest that Tala&apos;at intends us to know what the Committee of Union and Progress terms are, and to impress us with the danger to which we are exposed in Mesopotamia.This is good bargaining ; he gives us his terms in such a way that he need never take them up even if we offer them, and at the same time rattles his sabre in a way which he has taught us to know is something more than bluff. In fact, these manoeuvres are simply intended to lead up to our suing for peace on the most advantageous terms to Turkey that the Committee of Union and Progress consider possible at the present time.To obtain such terms it is manifest that the Committee of Union and Progress would not be above sacrificing a puppet like Enver, whose suppression would not matter a straw to Talaat, or even condescending to a little political window-dressing such as engineering a sham counter-revolution against itself. In Turkey revolutions never go much further than their authors intend, and have never yet affected the military power of the Turks. Once a separate peace was made, a coup: oVEtat. could, repudiate any inconvenient articles. Lastly, it should not be forgotten that the Committee of Union and Progress is most likely endeavouring to intrigue with France and Italy, and that not the least of its objects is to involve the allies in. secret and separate negotiations with a view to playing them off one against the other.Turkey.   (Massacres.)   [P. 4.]The massacres of the Asiatic Greeks, so long threatened and so long delayed, now seem to have fairly begun. This will only be the completion of Tala&apos;at&apos;s original policy of the complete destruction of all Christian elements in Turkey. The Armenians and Syrian Christians have already been dealt with.Syria.    (Artificial Famine.)   [P. 5.]The success of Tala&apos;at&apos;s extermination policy in the Lebanon now seems to be complete.Arabia (Yemen).   [Pp. 5 and 7.]Taken in conjunction with previous telegrams on this head, it would appear from Sir R. Wingate&apos;s 836 as if there was a real opportunity of bringing Turkish rule in Southern Arabia to an end.Egypt.   [P. 7.]The &apos;: M ok attain &apos;s &quot; publication concerning M. ribot&apos;s alleged disavowal of French projects in Syria is very regrettable and will tend to produce further friction. Its passing through the Paris censor points to some complicated manoeuvring. Probably the Maronites in Paris wanted to force M. Ribot to an ultra-colonial declaration, the Turcophil financiers in Paris wanted to create a feeling of uncertainty, the Franco-phobe Syrians in Egypt desired to do the French a bad turn. Thus parties working towards different ends combine at least to achieve one purpose, viz., to promote suspicion between England and France.M. S.August 10, 1917.

Buchanan telegraphed on the 2nd August [No. 1179] that it had been hoped on the previous day that the Government and the Cadets would have reached an agreement. M. Kerensky had stated in a conciliatory letter that the policy of the Government would be based on the.three declarations already published, and had expressed the conviction that there was nothing to prevent them from joining such a Government ; but it was one of these declarations, that of the 21st July, to which the Cadets took exception. M. Terestchenko criticised the conduct of the Cadets as unpatriotic; the Government, he said, bad, with the exception of the* When M. Kerensky is absent, M. Nekrassoff will act as Vice-Premier. [898-55J . B
exclusion of M. Tchernoff from the Ministry, accepted all their conditions; but the Cadets wanted a party triumph. Consequently he and M. Kerensky had decided to resign. On the following clay he telegraphed [No1. 1185] that the resignations had been announced and subsequently withdrawn. M. Tchernoff, that he might be free to defend himself against the charges brought against him, had also resigned, but his office would be kept vacant till he had definitely rehabilitated himself. .On the 4th August he telegraphed again \ No. 1190] giving an account of the Cabinet crisis taken from that rnorning&apos;s press. On the 3rd August, he said, at midday M. Kerensky appeared at a Cabinet meeting and announced his decision to resign owing to his failure to form a National Cabinet, which alone, in his opinion, could prevent absolute ruin and disaster. The non-Socialist Ministers, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Socialist Minister for Labour, declared that under such circum-stances they also could no longer remain in the Cabinet. At 6 p.m. M. Kerensky formally notified M. NekrasoFf of his decision, and at once left. The Cabinet decided to refuse to accept any resignation, and issued an invitation to all the more important political and public organisations to attend a special sitting at the Winter Palace at 10 p.31. that evening to discuss the situation.At 9 o&apos;clock M. Tseretelli went to the headquarters of the Sovyet, and informed the combined Executive Committee of the whole course of the Cabinet crisis. The news created feelings of alarm among the members, and immediate steps were taken to double the military guard round the Duma and to prevent any possible action by unauthorised bodies or persons or by a counter-revolutionary movement.At 10 o&apos;clock M. Nekrasoff opened the proceedings extraordinary, at which . about a hundred persons were present. Before proceeding to discuss the situation M. Rodzianko asked M. Nekrasoff to state how far rumours of fresh disaster on the South-Western Front were true ; under what circumstances General Erdeli. was killed, and what was the real cause of General Gourko&apos;s arrest. M. Nekrasoff declared that there had been a fresh break through, but he believed the situation would be successfully dealt with. Official details were not yet available about General Erdeli, but there were grounds for believing that he was killed by his own men while endeavouring to rally (them). General Gourko had been arrested in&apos; consequence of a letter, found among the imperial family correspondence, in which he declared his adherence to the old regime, and stated that he and others of his opinion would, for the time being, support the new regime but when an opportunity occurred they would endeavour to restore the monarchy.The proceedings proper of the evening then began. The State Comptroller insisted that the sole means of saving Russia at the present moment was the union of all classes and masses, irrespective of party considerations. M. Tereschenko pointed out the terrible fate threatening Russians immediate future if nothing were done. He complained that the nation was apparently impervious to the shame lying on it, standing idly by at a time when redoubled military preparations should be proceeding and provision for the coming hard autumn and still harder winter should be feverishly pushed ahead. He referred to financial ruin, the inevitable result of unheard-of financial demands made by a section of the people. Referring to the army, he described the situation at the front as appalling. Whole regiments had bolted from comparatively small enemy patrols, and even from small detachments of Cossacks whom they had mistaken for enemy cavalry. He declared the notorious Order 1 to the army a criminal act; although it was possibly evoked by the exceptional circumstances of the moment, it should be openly and officially condemned by the Sovyet, which issued it. At the same time M. Tereschenko stated that the behaviour of certain units and individuals had been beyond praise, especially that of officers who had committed suicide in desperate efforts to rally their men. He complained of the party attitude of the Sovyet, and insisted that unless the Government had the full support of all classes and political organisations absolute ruin stared Russia in the face. M. Kerensky, the only man who enjoyed the confidence of the whole country, must be given a free hand and unstinted support.&apos; M. Tseretelli spoke in the same sense; referring to the foreign policy of the country, he said that the only one possible was a continuation of war till the Russian people had thrown off the shame lying on them, and the freedom gained by the revolution had been duly secured. The Procurator of the Holy Synod insisted on the necessity of an undivided authority, supported unanimously by the whole country. M. Miliukoff pointed out that the proposals made dealing with the situation were identical with the conditions put for ward by his party, and suggested that M. Kerensky should be given authority to form a Cabinet of such men as he thought necessary to save the country.   It  might be argued   he  had  had such   authority and  failed,   but
M. Kerensky, pulled one way by the Constitutional Democrat party and in another by the Sovyet, should be given real, not nominal, freedom of action. Other speakers having spoken in the same sense, M. Terestchenko spoke again, saying that it was quite clear-that the majority of those present did not realise that the present situation was wasting time by petty party manoeuvres and frothy speeches.M. Nekrasoff then spoke. His speech, which was short and impassioned, made a profound impression. Ha declared that every moment lost in party disputes and rhetorical displays was fraught with disaster to the State. The new Commander-in-. Chief was waiting for a reply to his conditions before taking up his new duties. No reply could be given by the Government without authority. The last fortnight had been a nightmare of suffering for the members of the Cabinet. They had been compelled to spend more time in presenting requests and making statements to the Sovyet, to prevent its intervention, than on actual affairs of State ; twice weekly the Cabinet had rendered an account of the most trivial details. The counter-revolution was in reality growing in strength every day, every hour, and the horrors which must overtake the country, should one break out, defied description. &apos; The Government asked one of two things : either that it should have the power and the time to work unfettered, with the loyal support of all, or that the Sovyet should take over all authority and responsibility.At 4 a.m., Sir G. Buchanan said, the meeting was&apos;still in progress, but no decision had been reached.Later on the same day he telegraphed again [No. 1194] saying that he had heard that the meeting had passed resolutions expressing confidence in M. Kerensky, authorising him to form a Cabinet and to appoint Ministers irrespective of party. The present Ministers are stated to have expressed their readiness to return their portfolios, so that M. Kerensky might have an. entirely free hand in the choice of a Cabinet. The main difficulty seemed to be an unwillingness on the part of the delegates of the Sovyet to renounce the control of the Government. Whilst the Constitutional Democrat party had made no conditions, the Socialist representatives, including Tseretelli, maintained that the Soyvets were necessary, and made their support of M. Kerensky conditional on the strict fulfilment of the Government programme published in July. The action of the Socialist delegates was approved by the Sovyet, after a prolonged and heated discussion, by 140 votes to 47.On the 6th August he telegraphed [No. 1210 j that a Government had at last been formed, by M. Kerensky. Sir G. Buchanan said that the best men among the new members of the Government were M. Prokopovitch, president of the Moscow Corporation,. who had had great business experience; M. Avksentieff. president of the Council of Peasants ; and M. Savenkoff. The last-named, who took part in the murders of the Grand Duke Sergius and Plehve, was a very strong man who insisted on the restoration of discipline in the army and the adoption of stringent measures for the repression of anarchy. Pie added that M. Bernatzky would assist M. Nekrassoff and virtually run the Ministry.The Stockholm Conference- Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan on the 1st August [No. 1597] in regard to this Conference, and the question (which might come up at any moment for decision) of British delegates being allowed to attend it. France and America w-ere, he believed, unfriendly to the Conference, and Italy would allow no Italian representatives to attend. His Majesty&apos;s Government could not acquiesce in the pretensions of some leaders of the International that their society should direct the policy of Europe and America. The objections to British delegates going to Stockholm were serious ; the main arguments in favour of their doing so were that the Germans would dominate the situation if only they, Russians, and neutrals took part in the proceedings; that the Russian Government desired the attendance cf British delegates ; and that a refusal to give the required permission would be put down to some sinister imperialistic motive. Sir G. Buchanan was instructed to send any information he might possess as to the attitude of the Prussians.Sir G. Buchanan replied on the following day [No. 1180] that the Socialist members of the Government were all in favour of the Conference, though he had been informed that their expectations of its results had fallen very much of late. The other members would place no obstacle in the way of attendance of the Russian Socialists, though they would not consider themselves bound by the decisions of the Conference, which they would much prefer should not take place, as they were afraid that any talk about peace would have a bad effect on the army.Military   Commandant   in  Petrograd. It  was  proposed  to  appoint   Captain Roschakovski to this office [Eastern&apos; Report XXVIi, p. 8], but Sir G. Buchanan
telegraphed on the 2nd August [No. 1177] that General Vasilkovski, a Cossack, had actually been appointed, as it had been found to be impossible to dispense with the other officers services on the Murman Railway.POLAND,Recognition of Poles in Allied Countries. Mr. Balfour having proposed that the Allied Governments should, each in its own country, recognise the Poles as friends and potential allies, whether they came from-Galicia, Posen, or Russian Poland, and that a Polish committee should be set up in each of the allied countries [Eastern Report NXVT, p. 3], Lord Bertie telegraphed on the 1st August [No.-751J that the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government were concurred in by the French Government. The latter Government understood that a meeting of Polish politicians in Switzerland was about to examine the conditions under which such committees could be created.RUMANIA.The Question of Evacuation. Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 31st July [No. 415] that in Moldavia and in countries where Rumanians resided a very active propaganda in favour of a separate peace was being carried on by Germany. With a view to combating this, he, with his ,French and Italian colleagues (who were telegraphing in the same sense to their own Governments), urged that Russia should be pressed to hold the Moldavian front at any cost; that a scheme of evacuation should be forthwith prepared, in concert with the representatives of the signatories, of the Convention of Bucharest, by the Prussian military authorities; and that these signatories should collectively guarantee that if evacuation should become inevitable, a military zone should be assigned to Rumania with all the prerogatives of sovereignty for the State and its King, the signatories further guaranteeing the provisioning of the evacuated army and population.Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 2nd August [No. 1178] that he had com-municated the substance of the above to M. Terestchenko, who expressed himself favourably in regard to the desiderata, but he had not heard from his Minister in Jassy.TURKEY.Ayoub Sabri [see Eastern Report XXI,p.2; XXII, p. 5; XXVII, p. 3.]-SirW.Townley telegraphed [No. 2268 j on the 25th July that the Dutch Minister in Constantinople had reported that the Grand Vizier had again stated that the Turkish Government reserved to itself the right to intern all British subjects and to accord them the same treatment as that of Turkish subjects in England, if the British Government should refuse to repatriate Ayoub Sabri and the other Turks subjected to reprisals. In reply, on the 4th August Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 2119] to the Dutch Minister in Constantinople, through Sir W. Townley, asking him to inquire for the names and whereabouts of the Turks who were alleged to be suffering reprisals, as the British Government was not aware of any such in British hands ; he added that only 80 were interned of all those who were in this country.Massacre of Greeks. Reliable information has been received to the effect that there have been massacres of Greeks on an extensive scale; the number of those massacred has been placed at 40,000, but this is probably an exaggeration.ABYSSINIA.Lij Yasu. In the last Report [p. 8] a telegram from Sir R. Wingate was printed saying that &quot;Lij Yasu had successfully reconnoitred the capital of Edjn&quot;; from an amended copy of the telegram it appears that this should have been &quot; had successfully occupied the capital,&quot; &amp;c.Negotiations with Ras Taffari. With reference to Ras Taffarfs demand for a guarantee with regard to the properties possessed by Abyssinians in Jerusalem before the war [Eastern Report XXVI, p. 4], Mr. Balfour telegraphed on the 4th August [No. 53] that, in the absence of knowledge as to what properties were intended, the question of a guarantee could not be considered ; he asked whether the Deir-es-Sultan
monastery was one of them. On the same day.he seat another telegram [No. 54], saying that Mr. Thesiger might join his French and Italian colleagues in demanding a rupture between Abyssinia and Austria-Hungary, which was desired by their Govern-ments, and further, he might make this rupture a condition precedent for the supply of srms.SYRIA.The Lebanon. An agent reports that a Syrian-born American subject, who has escaped, estimates that 150,000 inhabitants of the Lebanon have died of typhus -or starvation.The Baalbek \District.--rY\\Q same informant states that, with the exception of gendarmes, there are hardly any troops in this district, which is more or less in revolt.ARABIA.Bed Sea Blockade. -The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 3rd August [416 A.P.] in regard to the export of petroleum to Jaizan. The comparatively small amount of petroleum required by Asir is supplied by Aden via Jaizan ; in spite of this, on the 31st July the Governor of Jibuti had applied, through the French consul, for permission to export 2,900 cases of petroleum to Jaizan, and on the following day Oarneran reported two Italian dhows with 900 cases; the Resident ordered the removal of the oil, to be restored to the dhows on their return journey to Massowah. He had also informed the French consul that, in view of the great value of petroleum to the Turks, he could not agree to the import of this quantity into Jaizan, and had requested him and his Italian colleague to inform their Governments that the import to the Arabian coast ports should be discontinued. The Governor of Jibuti, who proposed to make this considerable export to Jaizan, had asked for supplies of kerosene for Aden for urgent local require-ments, as had also the Governor of Eritbrea.Yemen.The Confederacy [Eastern Report XVI, p. 7 ; XVII, p. 4 ; XVIII, p. 7 ; XIX, p. 4&apos;j. The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 5th August [417 A.P.] saying that he had received a letter regarding the confederacy from one of its adherents, Kaid Ibn Ahmed of Hajaria, enclosing other letters from Said Ahmed of Taiz and Yehai Ibn Yehai Ash Sahif. Ibn Ahmed, urging us not to forsake them, asked for money, arms, and ammunition to help the movement against the Turks, who had murdered Abu Ras ; Yehai Ibn Yehai (who had already taken Alkaida) undertook to capture Taiz and Almfid during the month of Ramazan, and Said Ahmed anticipated success if the assistance asked for were given. Abdulla Sultan still advised that help should be given. The Resident himself was in favour of financial help being given to Kaid Ibu Ahmed he is Shafei and not under the Imam. In regard to the latter&apos;s recent overtures the President presumed that Idrisi should negotiate conditions with Bakill and Hashid, in accordance with the permission given a year ago. If this sanction were cancelled Idrisi would be again upset and would have a legitimate cause of complaint, and the negotiations were being pressed at Jaizan by Said Mustaffa ; but these negotiations must prejudice the Imam.In regard to this the Viceroy telegraphed on the 1st August saying that his Government at the present juncture deprecated even monetary assistance to the confederacy, which he said the Resident seemed disposed to accept at its own valuation, failing to realise that in Southern Arabia the Imam was the most important factor. In the opinion of the Indian Government the proper policy was to leave -Idrisi to his policy of benevolent inertia&apos;; to avoid all action calculated to hamper an understanding with Imam; and to leave the confederacy to prove its worth on the understanding that, when it had shown by overt acts that it had power to eject the Turk and that this ejection was its real objective, it would be helped with arms and money. As regards Hashid and Bakil, we might well leave the matter alone, as there seemed little or no likelihood of Idrisi detaching them.[898-55]C
LATEST  INTELLIGENCE.&quot;RUSSIA.The, Stockholm Conference [supra; p. 3j.  On the 8th August M. Nabokoff addressed the following letter to Mr. Balfour : In a telegram I sent to the Russian Foreign Minister three or four days ago I gave him an account of the statements made in the House of Commons by the Prime Minister and Mr. Henderson concerning the latter&apos;s visit to Paris, as well as of Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s statements regarding the Stockholm Conference and of the discussions which were taking place in the different labour organisations of Great Britain as to the desirability of sending delegates to Stockholm. I also drew the Russian Foreign Ministers attention to the reply given by the American Federation of Labour to the French Confederation Generate du. Travail.- In conclusion I said the following : &quot; I consider it absolutely necessary, with a view to safeguarding the stability and closeness of our union with Great Britain, where the majority of public opinion is adverse to the Conference, that I should be in a position to declare most emphatically to Mr. Balfour that the Russian. Government, as well as His Majesty&apos;s Government, regard this matter as a party concern and not a matter of State, and that the decisions of the Conference, should it be convened, would in no way be binding on the future course of Russian policy and of Russia&apos;s relations with her Allies.&quot;In reply to this message I have just received the following telegram : &apos;-1 entirely approve of the declaration to be made to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the sense suggested by you, and you are hereby authorised to inform the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that, although the Russian Government do not deem it possible to prevent Russian delegates from taking part in the Stockholm Conference, they regard this Conference as a party concern and its decisions in no wise binding upon the liberty of action of the Government.&quot;I hasten to lay before you the above information as I fear that the impression has hitherto prevailed that, in the words of one of the London newpapers, &quot; Russia ardently desired the Stockholm Conference,&quot; and this argument has been put forward in order to influence British public opinion in favour of the Labour and Socialist Parties of Great Britain participating in the Conference.TURKEY.The Question of a Separate Peace. An agent reports having had communications with a correspondent of Talaat Pasha, who gave him thelatter&apos;s views (as contained in a letter from him) on the question of a separate peace. He said that some three months ago the Turkish Government had decided to treat with the Allies for peace, the main terms to be proposed being roughly as follows : (1) The Turks would solemnly guarantee to cease all intrigues in India, and to give their moral help (through the Sultan Caliph) to calm Moslem unrest in that land. (2) The Baghdad-Basra railway would be made really international. (-3) Mesopotamia, Arabia, Armenia, and perhaps Syria would be given autonomy on terms to be arranged, and each province would send delegates to a central federal&quot; parliament in Constantinople. Autonomous Arabia would not be under the King of Hejaz, and under no conditions could the Sultan of Turkey submit to the loss of the caliphate [which, it must be noted, lias not yet been claimed by the King of Hejaz] ; and Great Britain must agree to withdraw her forces from Mesopotamia. (4) There would be certain financial rearrangements &quot;and adjust-ments. The decision to offer these terms was reached just before Talaat went to Berlin ; afrer his return, the idea of a separate peace was abandoned for the following reasons : The submarine campaign would, it was believed, sooner or later make England sue for a separate peace; the Central Powers guaranteed Turkey against loss of territory and granted certain financial con cessions ; Germany had persuaded Turkey that Russia was collapsing, and that the coming Austro-German offensive would seal her fate and make a separate peace with Russia almost certain ; this peace would release a considerable number of troops for a great attack upon Mesopotamia, and a British defeat there would mean much better terms for Turkey in the peace treaty ; and, finally, there was no menace to Jerusalem or the railways, as the Palestine front was absolutely secure from a British attack moreover, the British had no real interest in the taking of Palestine, as that, would eventually lead to trouble with her allies.Talaat emphasised the last point that we should never be able to take Palestine.
He added that the attack on Baghdad would take place as soon as the season permitted, and they fully expected to retake it, as the Turks were sending their beat soldiers, and. with them a great deal of heavy Austrian artillery.ABYSSINIA.Negotiations with lias Taffari [supra, p. 4]. Mr, Thesiger telegraphed on the 4th August [No. 50] that on certain conditions, which cancelled those jsreviously suggested, the Abyssinian Government definitely agreed to expel the Germans, the Austrians, and the Turks. The agreement would take effect immediately it was signed, and Mr. Thesiger strongly urged the acceptance of the proposals, which were as follows : 1. Abyssinia should be allowed to purchase 30,000 Gras rifles from the French Government, with 6.000,000 cartridges. Mr. Thesiger said that a reduction of the number of cartridges might be enforced, but, unless the Italian opposition were very serious, he could not recommend this being attempted.2. Both sides would continue to observe all French proposals for treaties ; this (for the purpose) of guarantee of independent and mutual endeavours.3. If Abyssinia should have a (? more or less) (? responsible) Government the three Powers should agree to mediation between them and (? the former).4. That after the war no territory adjoining Abyssinia should be the headquarters of the Central Powers or their allies.5. Abyssinia to be represented at the Peace Conference. As to this, Mr. Thesiger suggests a promise of equal treatment with other countries,Mr. Thesiger suggested that Bussia should also sign the agreement.SYRIA.French Intentions in regard to Syria. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 8th August [No. 832] saying that a telegram, of which following was the gist, had been received from its Paris correspondent by &quot; El Mokattam,&quot; and published in that paper on the 4th August :  Paris papers have discussed passages in M. ribot&apos;s and Mr. Balfour&apos;s speeches in reply to the accusation which Dr. Michaelis brought against France that, after agree-ment which France made with the Imperial Government of Russia in February last, she would not be satisfied with return of Alsace-Lorraine, but wanted to occupy Syria. M. Ribot denied the accusation brought against France regarding the occupation of Syria, and he brought in support of his evidence decision of the House of Deputies. M. Ribot finally stated that France only wished to get back Alsace-Lorraine to be indemnified for loss which she has undergone. He denied any suggestion of the occupation of Syria or of any other country. The French papers declared themselves in full accord with M. ribot&apos;s speech; the newspaper &quot; (Euvre&quot; blamed the Fz-ench Government because it had not published this plain decision regarding Syria before now.M. Defrance alleged that this had had an unfortunate effect on pro-French Syrians in Egypt, and took exception to its having been passed by the censor. It was, however, pointed out that it had been presumed that the French authorities considered its publication desirable as the telegram had come from Paris. Sir R. Wingate understood that M. Defrance was publishing a dementi, M. Ribot having telegraphed to the French agency in Cairo denying that he hap made any mention of Syria in his speech.ARABIA,Yemen.The Confederacy.-^ R. Wingate telegraphed on the 9th August [No. 836] that information received in Cairo indicated that the ImanVs influence had much decreased with the Yemen Arabs. A doubt on his part as to whether his Turcophil policy could be much longer maintained was implied in the fact that he was desirous of opening-negotiations with us ; but his position might well be rendered precarious if he broke with the Turks, who had been the chief prop to his authority of late years.   The
&apos; : 8 &quot; &apos;   7:Yemen Arabs regard him as irretrievably committed to the Turks, and it would be natural that, in the event of a breach, they would endeavour to set up a candidate for the lmamate who could come to terms with us. AH the requirements of a powerful candidate were to be found in Yahia Ibn Mohammed Yahia Ibn El Hadi, the new power in the land, who, according to Aden, has already a considerable number of local supporters. The opinion that the present Imam Yahia was and would remain the most potent factor in Yemen politics should be modified, and we should be prepared for a radical change in the situation. Sir It. Wingate then suggested a formula which, he said, would justify immediate monetary assistance to the confederacy, and should it become advisable a subsequent grant of arms and ammunition, and would also enable us to continue negotiations with both the Imam and the confederacy till such time as their relative strength and utility to us became clearer. The proposed formula is as follows : That we will provide every assistance in our power to Arabs fighting for their freedom against the Turks, who are our enemies and the enemies of Arabian independence.That in doing so we have no intention of departing from our traditional policy of non-intervention in religious or internal Arabian affairs, and we do not - wish to take sides in disputes between Arabs. We therefore strongly deprecate proposals whencesoever coming which tend to discussion at a time when all Arabs are required to combine against the common Turkish enemy of their race and their territorial independence.The Imam. The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 8th August [420 A.P.] reporting information received from Hussein Abdul Kadir Makkawi in regard to a meeting which took place about the 23rd July between the Zaidi chiefs and the Imam with reference to the murder of Abu Ras, as to whether the former refused to take the Imam&apos;s advice that a money compensation should be accepted. The Imam then suggested the support of Ibn Rashid against King Hussein, and the despatch of a Zaidi force for that purpose ; and it was said that the Imam was making preparations to do so. After this meeting 4,000 men of Dhu Mohammed and Dhu Hussein joined forces with the successor of Abu Ras, Kaid Ibn Harsan. Several thousand of the Imam&apos;s men were said to be marching towards Mawia, under the command of Abu Naib; their object was unknown. The Shaykhs of Ibb had revolted against the Imam and the Turks.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE  BY C. K.  HARRISON.-10/8/1917.

ARABIA. Hejaz.Intelligence.The operations of Sherif Feisal, already alluded to in the last/bulletin, were begun on the night of drily 6 by a success-fid raid on the railway just south of Seil Matara, of which a full report will be found below. On the same night, another attack was made between Mabrak el Naka and Abu take, resulting in the destruction of 150 rails and twenty-four telegraph poles. Full details of this have not yet been received. Since these episodes there has been a lull, chiefly due to the departure for a few days of Sherif Feisal to Sherif Abdullah^ camp. The aeroplanes have, however, been active, and on the 12th in sr. dropped fourteen 20-lb. bombs on El Ula, causing damage to the station buildings and water tank enclosure. They estimated the garrison at less than 1,000 men with 200 mules&apos;.Reports from various sources agree that there is a serious shortage of food, fodder and wood in the Turkish camps from Maan to Medain Sal eh. This has led to discontent among the Arabs who have hitherto been faithful to the Turks, and the open disaffection of the Belli Atiyah tribe, who, after destroying the line near Wadi Ethil and capturing some Turkish soldiers, have threatened the Turkish garrison at Tebuk. Sheikh Sultan of the Fuqara, near Medain Saleh, has also come over to the Arabs and it is said that orders for his arrest have been issued by the Turks. Some of the Billi constituents are still faithful to the enemy, but the followers of Sheikh Eid, the cousin of Sheikh Suleiman Rifada (see Bulletin 1916, p. 227) are reported to be wavering owing to the non-receipt of supplies.An explanation of the recent activity of the tribes round Maan, referred to in the last bulletin, has readied us in the person of Capt. Lawrence, after coloured adventures in that district. The results achieved may be summarised as follows : He left Wejh on May 9 with Sherif Nasir ibn Husein as O.C. Expedition, and Nesib Bey el Bakri as Political Officer, picked up thirty-six men and also Aucla Abu Tayi (of whom more below) and he arrived at Akaba on July 8 with an army of 2,000 Arabs, and a tally to their credit of 700 dead Turks and 600 prisoners. The Arab concentration, which, to produce these results, they had busied themselves in forming, took place at El Bair to the N.E. of Maan and was under the general command of Sherif Nasir. The main force moved to El Jafar on June 30, clearing one well, and thence to kilo. 479 where the line was destroyed on a large scale, while a column was attacking N. of Maan near Aneyza. The Arabs then marched towards Fuweilah, where the gendarme post had been destroyed by an advance column. They were met with the news of the re-occupation of Fuweilah  by a belated
relief expedition of the 4th Battn. of the 174th Regt. from Maan. This was completely defeated on July 2 at Abu Bissau, the O.C., 160 men and. a mountain gun being captured, and the rest of the battalion annihilated. At the same time, a flying column was sent north which defeated the Turkish post at Hisha (railhead five miles E. of Shobak) and occupied Wadi Musa, Shobek and Tafileh.From Fuweilah the main force advanced and captured the post of Mreigha and then moved to Guweira, where it was reinforced by Ibn Jad of the Akaba Howeitat, and took 100 men and five officers. From Guweira it marched on El Kethira (wiping out a post of three officers ancl 140 men.) and thence to El Khadra, in the ISlorth of Wadi Ithm, where the Akaba garrison surrendered at discretion. Akaba was entered on July 6 with 600 prisoners, about forty officers and a German Unter-Offizier well-borer. Of these, the German, twenty-five Turkish officers and 360 rank and file have been sent to Egypt, while the remainder, being Arabs or Syrians, have volunteered and been incorporated into the Arab army. The Turkish dead are estimated at 700.The forces which accomplished these remarkably successful operations were mainly Abu Tayyi Howeitat under Sheikh Auda Abu Tayi, Rualla Anazeh under Sheikh ibn Dughmi and Sherarat. Their losses were only four men killed ancl five men Avounded in the actual fighting, though an old man, six women and seven children were surprised in their tents by a Turkish, cavalry patrol and slaughtered.At present some 5,000 Arabs are in arms in the Maan area. Reports show that the Turks fully realise the danger of the threat ancl are likely to attempt strong measures. They are already^y reported to have brought down some mule mounted companies to Maan and to have enlisted the help of 500 Beni Sakhr Arabs, 250 from Kerak and fifty of the Khoreisha Howeitat. Sheikh Fawwaz ibn Faiz of the Beni Sakhr, who was one of then-chief supports, has died within the last few weeks. Sheikh Mishkal is mentioned as his successor and they can count on Sheikh Hamed el Arar, but the Trad and Zebu elements of the Beni Sakhr, as well as the larger portion of the Ibn Jazi section, are on the side of the Sherif. From all that Capt. Lawrence-could hear, the disposition of the northern tribes is increasingly anti-Turk ancl favourable to the Sherif of Mecca. Sheikh jSTuri Shaalan and his son Nawwaf have re-affirmed their loyalty. The Druses are deeply incensed against the Turks and the same-feeling exists among the Serdiyah, the Jebeliyah and the Metawala of Anti Lebanon and the Orontes valley. Sheikh, Fahad ibn Hadhdhal of the Amarat has come in to Bagdad and offered the whole hearted support of himself ancl his tribes and there is reason to believe that the Western Bishr and border tribes from Horns to Aleppo are equally ready to cut loose from, the Turks should a favourable occasion arise.
The iloweitat and their chiefs.The Hovveitat used to be all under Ibn Rush id a family which still exists in the Akaba in the his majesty&apos;s , but is grown poor and weak. &apos;\ hey were then for a little presided over by Ibn Jazi; and from this period dates their sub-division into discordant sections with independent foreign policies.The Abu Tayi sub-section is the joint work of Auda, the fighting man, and Mohammed el-Dheilan, the thinker. It fell out with Ibn Jazi. over the latter&apos;s treatment of a Sherari guest of Auda&apos;s, and in. the fifteen year old feud Annad, Auda&apos;s full grown son was killed. This feud is the greatest of the Sherifs difficulties in the operations lately at Maan and has driven Hamed el-Arar, the &quot;ibn Jazi&quot; of to-day, into the arms of the Turks, while Saheiman Abu Tiyur and the rest of the sub-tribe are at Wejh with Sidi Feisal. Auda has offered them peace and friendship at the request of Feisal ; and it was perhaps the hardest: thing the olcl man has ever had to do. The death of Annacl killed all his hopes and ambitions for the Abu Tayi in the desert, and has.made his life a bitter failure ; but it is a fixed principle of the Sherif that his followers have no blood feuds, and no Arab enemies, save the Shammar, who are enemies of the Arab. His success in burying the innumerable hatchets of the Hejaz, is the most pregnant indication of his future government. In all Arab minds the Sherif now stands above tribes, the tribal sheikhs and tribal jealousies. His is the dignity of the peacemaker, and the prestige of independent, superposed author! ty. He does not take sides or declare in their disputes : he mediates, and ensues a settlement.The head man of the Abu Tayi is, of course, the inimitable Auda. He must-be nearly fifty now (he admits forty) and his black beard is tinged with white, but he is still tall and straight, loosely built, spare and powerful, and as active as a much younger man. His &quot;lined and haggard face is pure Bedouin : broad low forehead, high sharp hooked nose, brown-green eyes, slanting outward, large mouth, (now unfortunately toothless, for his false teeth were Turkish, and his patriotism made him sacrifice them with a hammer, the day he swore allegiance to Feisal in Wejh), pointed beard and moustache, with the lower jaw shaven dean in. the Howeilat style. The Howeitat pride themselves on being altogether Bedu, and Auda is the essence of the Abu Tayi. His hospitality is sweeping (inconvenient, except to very hungry souls): his generosity has reduced him to poverty, and devoured the profits of a hundred successful raids. He has married twenty-eight times, has been wounded thirteen times, and iii his battles has seen all his tribesmen hurt, and most of his relations killed. He has only reported his &quot;kill&quot; since 1900, and they now stand at seventy-five Arabs ; Turks are not counted by Auda when they are dead. Under his handling the Toweihah have become the finest fighting force in Western Arabia.   He raids as often as he can each year (&quot; but a year
passes so qu.ick.l_y, Sidi&quot;) and has seen Aleppo, Basra, Taif, Wejh and Wadi Dawasir in his armed expeditions.In his way, Auda is as hard-headecl as he is hot-headed. His patience is extreme, and he receives (and ignores) advice, criticism, or abuse with a smile as constant as it is very charming. Nothing on earth would make him change his mind or obey an order or follow a course he disapproved. He sees life as a sage and all events in it are significant and all personages heroic. His mind is packed (and generally overflows) with stories of old raids and epic poems of fights. When he cannot secure a listener he sings to himself in his tremendous voice, which is also deep and musical. In the echoing valleys of Arnousa, our guide in night marches was this wonderful voice of Auda&apos;s, conversing far in the van, and being- rolled back to us from the broken faces of the cliffs. He speaks of himself in the third person, and he is so sure of his fame that he delights to roar out-stories against himself. At times he seems seized with a demon of mischief and in large gatherings shouts appalling stories of the private matters of his host or guests : with all this he is modest, simple as a child, direct, honest, kind-hearted, affectionate, and warmly loved even by those to whom he is most trying his friends.He is rather like Cassar&apos;s tribe, in his faculty for keeping-round him a free territory, and then a great ring of enemies. Nuri Shaalan pretends only to love Auda but in reality he and. the Sukhur, and all friendly chiefs also, go about in terror lest they should offend in some way against Aucla&apos;s pleasure. He loses no opportunity of adding to his enemies and relishes the new situation most because it is an ideal excuse to take on the Turkish Government.   &quot;To the Mutessarif of Kerak from Audaabu Tayi........greeting.   Take notice to quit Arab territorybefore the end of Ramadan. AVe want it for ourselves. Should you not go, I declare you outlawed and God will decide between us.&quot; Such was Auda&apos;s cartel to the Government the day we struck.After Auda, Mohammed el Dheilan is the chief figure in the tribe. He is taller than Auda, and massively built, a square headed intelligent, thoughtful man of perhaps thirty-five, with a sour humour and a kind heart carefullj&apos; concealed beneath it. In his youth he was notoriously wild, but reformed himself the night he was condemned to be hanged by Nevris Bey, Sami Pasha&apos;s Staff Officer, and has repaid many of the injuries he once wrought. He acted as business manager of the Abu Tayi and their spokesman with the Government. His tastes arc rather luscious, and his ploughed land at Tafileh and his little house at Maan introduced him to luxuries which took root among the tribe: hence the mineral waters and parasols of a Howeitat tiliazzu. Mohammed is greedy, richer than Auda, more calculating, deeper -but a fine fighting man too, and one who
- 31-1 -knows how to appeal to everything in his hearers&apos; natures, and to bend them to his will by words.Zaal ibn Motlog is Auda&apos;s nephew. He is about twenty-five, with petite features, carefully curled moustache, polished teeth, trimmed and pointed beard, like a French professional man. He, too, is greedy (of all Arabs 1 have met the Howeitat were the most open, most constant, most shameless beggars, wearying one day and night with their mean importunities and preposterous demands), sharp as a needle, of no great mental strength, but trained for years by Auda as chief scout to the tribe, ancl. therefore a most capable ancl dashing commander of a raid.Auda ibn Zaal is the fourth great man of Abu Tayi. He is silent and more usual in type than Auda, Mohammed, or Zaal, but the Howeitat flock to his side when there is a raid, and say that in action for concentrated force he is second only to Auda, with something of the skill of Mohammed super-added. Personally I have seen all four chiefs under fire, and saw in them all a headlong unreasoning clash and courage that accounted easily for the scarred and mutilated figures of their tribesmen.The fighting strength of the Abu Tayi is 535 camelmen and twenty-five horsemen.T. E. L.Raid on the Railway,The following is condensed from reports of Lieut.-Colonel Newcombe, in continuation, of his report given on pages 299 and 300, and of Miralai Davenport Bey : Col. JSTewcombe waited with Khaled Effendi&apos;s Arabs at Tefiha till the return of Capt. Hornby from his reconnaissance. This showed that the road via Ourash to Shellal was not safe, Shellal being only three miles from Medain Saleh, but a different road was found direct from Tefiha to Tharba, twelve miles distant and one hour from the railway N.W. of Mabrak el Naka, and where there was good water. He instructed Khaled- Effendi and Capt. Hornby to go to Tharba and cut the railway from there and other water pools to the north.On June 27 Col. Newcombe returned to Jeida (50 miles) . visited Wejh, where he conferred with Sherif Feisal and picked up Jaafar Pasha and, returning via Jeida, reached Wagir on the night of July 4, with Lieut.-Colonel Joyce, Miralai Davenport Bey, Lieut. Wade (of Armoured Cars), Indians and about one. hundred Egyptians and some Bisha, also Sheikh Hamad el Mangara and. Sherif Ali Husein. The distance to the railway from Wagir was over thirty miles, and. there was no water on the way. The enterprise was therefore rather formidable. The)&apos;left early on July 6, getting within sight of the railway, after a very hot day&apos;s inarch at three miles an hour, at 6 p.m.   Here they
rested, and prepared the explosives, moving&apos; on again at 10 p.in. to the line itself, another four miles. Work was started at 1.15 a.m. on the 7th, close to the station at Sell Matara. The demolition parties consisted of fifty-five Egyptians with three Egyptian officers tinder Col. Newcombe and Col. Joyce. Twelve Egyptians formed the right wing, Jaafar Pasha with Bedouin and Bisha guarded the left flank, and thirty Egyptians, with Lieut. Wade, Yuzbashi Hihni Effencli, M.A. faufik Effendi and Abd el Mohsin, laid 480 charges of . gun-cotton. The Askaris were naturally unused to the job but thanks to the very good work of the officers mentioned, 450 rails were destroyed and over one and a half miles of telegraph wire pulled down and cut up. The explosions started about &apos;1 a.m. and were at once signalled with rockets from the Turkish post about a mile to the north. By 2.30 a.in. all explosions were finished, and firing had begun on the left flank. As this became too hot, and there was a large open plain for six miles to cover before daylight, work had to cease ; all were ordered to return to the camels and the retreat began. They were thirty-two miles from water, but all reached Wagir by evening with the exception of a Bashawish and five Egyptians, who, it was feared, had been taken prisoners. The Bashawish and three of the men turned up, however, two clays later, having been shown water by some Bedouin. Except for the regretted loss of the other two men, the raid was a^ery successful, considering that all the Egyptians were new to the work of laying and firing explosives, while the very long way (sixty-five miles there and back) without water made the journey one of haste.Col. Joyce left straight from the railway to join Sherif Abdullah near Wadi Ais, about sixty miles south, Col. Newcombe returned to Jeida, and Miralai Davenport went on to a well which Col. Newcombe had ordered to be cleared out at Bir Salim (? Saleh) in the Wadi Jizzil. Water had been found, and this will enable the base to be brought to within only twenty miles from the railway. From here Miralai Davenport was to start fresh raids on the line, and a French party with Bedouin, was expected to reach him about the 13th. Capt. horne)&apos; is believed to be active north of Medain Saleh and Ali el Ulanear Moadhdham. But, as Col. Newcombe closes his report, &quot;In this very waterless country of long distances and very misleading Bedouin (misleading partly due to ignorance, partly because their sole thoughts are money and not war) any settled programme is impossible.&quot;Letter from Sherif Abdullah, to King flusein.Abi Markhah,9th Ramadan, 1335..To the Master of Favours, May God protect him and grant him victory.The slave has returned to his place. The people are commencing the advance which will be crowned with victory and success by the will of God.
We are awaiting the arrival of the Army at Wejh to their central station which is probably Gayaclah. On their arrival we shall also move to either Hadiyah or Bueir.From Hadiyah. we can easily communicate with the Wejh army and prevent the Turkish Forces at Hadiyah from assisting the forces at El Ula. Hut Bneir is protected and well fortified, and if, which God forbid, the Wejh army does not succeed and the enemy withstands their attacks, the Turkish force is unable to drive us from our place except by means of two divisions, which thej&apos; cannot get because of the scarcity of the water and camel men.I. have left the matter of choosing one of the two places above named to your slave, my brother Feisal., according to his needs.On my return, 0 Master of Favours, 1 found the place full of Shammar tribes, so that some of the weak-minded thought that it was a mere strategern (on the part of our enemies).To-day El Ajil and El Said [sub-tribe of the Buttin section of the Dhafir, whose chief is Hamud ibn Suvveit] have arrived with their camels and Abd Aqab ibn Ajil (see p. 303) is with them. They all took the oath of loyalty and swore that all our enemies are their enemies and their friends our friends and they went to El Seir. 1 have sent four of them to their Sheikh and Emir to see whether they are with us or not ; if not, they had better go to wherever we may tell them.As fbn Ajil is the Vizier of Ibn el Rashid 1 thought it better not to send his people back with their camels, lest they might think that we are weak. I have dug some wells for them at El Seir, even fifty wells arc not enough for these Shammar.To-day -also, Duleim ibn Barak [chief of the Beni Rashid sub-tribe of the Huteim] arrived here with 700 camel men, and all the Sheikhs of the Huteim who have left Ibn el. Rashid entirely and went to El Harrak. The)&apos; are fair fighters and I shall treat them kindly and hospitably.0 Master of Favours, my place became like the day of resurrection because of the multitudes of people coming. The camels of the people who came number more than 3,000.The supplies here not being sufficient, 1 was compelled to buy 200 sacks of rice from Yambo to meet this sudden flood which is increasing wonderfully.Mijlad el-Ajman [Dahamishah tribe of the Amarat, between Jauf and Basrah] came and informed me that many more people are still coining. Therefore, I suggest that my supplies should be increased and an extra j610,000 be sent for the sake of the newcomers, otherwise I shall spend the pa)&apos; of the troops on the newcomers and presents for them.The slave is awaiting your majestic instructions on this matter.
MESOPOTAMIA.The Situation in Hail.Suleiman el-Dakhil, a native of Bureidah, one of whose daughters is married to Ibn Saud, has recently arrived in Baghdad, from Hail. Formerby in Baghdad, he had fallen under suspicion of the Ottoman Government owing to an article in his newspaper urging the Government not to quarrel with Ibn Saud, and, after the war broke out, went first to Nejf and thence to Hail, where he evaded the arrest which the Government ordered by telegraph. Ibn llashid interceded for him but received no reply and el-Dakhil on hearing that we were established in Baghdad, made his way there. The following, according to his account, is the position in Hail : There are three parties, Rashid ibn Leilah&apos;s friends, the Shammar and townsfolk who want to come in to us, on the ground that if we hold Iraq there is no other alternative, and the Emir, who, up to now, has been under the thumb of Ibn Leilah. The latter has been heavily bribed by the Turks. Of the moneys entrusted to him for Hail he has appropriated about three-fourths investing it in property in Constantinople. Of the one-fourth which reaches Hail, one-third goes to his own supporters, one-third to the Emir and one-third to the Shammar. The Shammar complain that they get no profit out of the Turkish alliance. The Ottoman representative at Hail is Abdul Hamid, an Egyptian. He has quarrelled with Ibn Leilah, and has retired to Mustajiddah. The Emir has forbidden him to go on to the railway; He and ibn Leilah send mutual recriminations to Jemal Pasha, Abdul Hamid saying that it is all Ibn Leilahs fault that ibn Rashid has done nothing, and vice versa.Suleiman was in Hail when Ibn Subhan quarrelled with the Emir and came to us. The cause of the quarrel was chiefly Ibn Subhan&apos;s   antagonism  to  Ibn   Leilah and jealousy of him.*[Note by Arab Bureau. This final paragraph is not of good omen for Arab unity.]As to the question of Ibn Saud, even if his letters to the Master of Favours and to the slave are friendly, yet the news which I get from his country makes it necessary that we must be very cautious of him, particularly during the pilgrimage which he has stated he intends to make;. He has put some troops and horsemen at the villages and in the desert under his orders.&quot;Whenever he asks for permission for, making the pilgrimage, 1 hope Your Majesty will not approve (of his coming).The Slave,Abdullah.
Suleiman heard that a good many Shammar Sheikhs have recently joined Ibn Subhan. Al Baij of. the Sinjarah, Al Maij and Nida ibn Nukbatyir of the Abdah and Ibn Thanayan. of the Sinjarah. They are all out against ibn Leilah and his policy which they regard as suicidal to the Shammar.While Suleiman was at Hail one biggish caravan (200 camels) came in from Kuweit bringing petroleum, cotton cloth, tobacco, coffee, but not rice or dates. This was the one which started for the Qasim and split up half way, part going to Hail and part to the Qasim. Driblets have come in from Kuweit over and above this, forty camels at a time, but the merchants are now very much afraid of sjoinsy to Kuweit fearing1 that Ibn Subhan will give information against them and have them arrested. As for the caravan which came up recently to Nejf, it was at the outside 4,000 camels strong, it loaded in great haste, not more than one-third of its full load, and left about four days ago in very great alarm lest it should be captured on the return journey. This caravan was sent out from Hail as a feeler. They are at the end of their food supplies, they were not certain of the truth of the report that we were holding Baghdad and the Iraq and they sent up the caravan to spy out the land. Its experiences will encourage the Shammar Sheikhs and the townsfolk in their desire to come to terms with us.Suleiman says.that Fahad Beg can absolutely control the whole Musablah from Nejd to the Iraq if he undertakes to do so.When he left Hail nothing was definitely known as to negotiations between lbn Rashid and Ibn Saud, but Suleiman had heard gossip that Ibn Rashid had asked for peace. He did not think that Ibn Saud would accept, as it was obviously not in his interest to do so. This is exactly what Ibn Saud said to us, but he added that he would come to terms with Ibn Rashid if we wished it.As to the position in the Qasim, Bureidah alone counts ; Aneizah will follow its head. It is true that the Qasim towns like a great deal of freedom but there is a strong party in Bureidah which does not wish for complete independence, for they fear that that would imply the return of their former Emirs, the Abu Hail, whom they hate. One of these, Mohammed, is now with Ibn Saud and stands high in his favour but is bitterly disliked at Bureidah. The other, Fahad, is at Hail and is much better liked by the Bureida.li people. He is anti-Turk. He refused an Ottoman subsidy. Ibn Saud&apos;s overlordship is infinitely preferable to that of Ibn Rashid. The Rashicl have a name for tyranny, whereas Ibn Saud deals very liberally with the Qasim towns and in ordinary times allows them complete freedom of trade.Ibn Rashicl is not popular. He never speaks in the Mejlis and does nothing to make himself a personal position.   The
Shammar look to the sons of his cousin Talal, who was murdered in 1906, as possible successors. These boys I saw three years ago in Hail ; Abdullah and Mohammed are their names. They were then aged respectively twelve and eleven, charming distinguished children. They are true Rashid ancl belong to an older branch than that of the present Emir. Munirah, his sister, and Mudhi, his mother, sent me greetings by Suleiman. The Shammar chiefs make a point of attending the coffee meetings of Abdullah and Mohammed, and invite them to their coffee gatherings. This year they refused to go out on the spring-raids unless the two boys were allowed to come also, and the Emir reluctantly consented. It is very improbable that the Shammar would accept an Emir outside the llashid family.G. L. B.Ibn SaucVs account of Ibn LeilaKs Defeat.A telegram from Sir Percy Cox of July 9 says that Ibn Saud, under date June 16, communicates that he was leaving-his son, Turki, at Qasim to watch Ibn Rashid, ancl expected himself to reach Riyadh on June 21. Ibn Saud gives further details of the recent fight between Ibn Rashicfsand Sherif ZeicVs forces. He says that Ibn Rash id sent Ibn Leilah with Turkish troops ancl a guard by the Hajar road to go to Medina or to Syria. When three clays out from Jebel Shammar, Ibn Leilah met the Hataim and the Firm Harb, Arabs of Hajar, and heard that they intended to plunder him. Ibn Rashid came out to help, but, with the exception of a few men, bis party fled. There were no Shammar with Ibn RashicTs forces, as they had separated into two parties, one of which, the Aslnm, joined Ibn Sauch The second partjr, the Abclah, had intended to help Ibn Rashid, but, fearing that Ibn Saud would seize their property, they changed their minds. On hearing this, other Arabs who had been with Ibn Rashid took refuge in the hills of Sehnah and Aja. The action&apos;, in which Ibn Leilah ancl Ibn Rashid-s forces were scattered, took place at Dueim. They are said to have abandoned almost every-&apos; thing, including loads of supplies intended for Medina. Twenty Turks and thirty men from Hail were reported killed, as well as Sezman Bey, the Turkish leader. Ibn Rashid himself escaped to Hifan near Hail. Ibn Leilah has guides from the Hataim and Harb with him, but is in danger from one of Ibn Saud&apos;s parties and also from local people.Abyssinian News.Ras Hailu of Gojjam, who had been detained in Adis Abeba, has received permission to return to his province after taking the most solemn oaths that he will remain faithful to the Empress and Ras Taffari.
It is probable that he is in earnest in giving these assurances, and certain that he would oppose the return of Lij Yasu by every means in his power. lie has, however, no illusions with regard to the rottenness of the present Government and makes no secret of his scorn of the Ministers, whom he looks upon as low-born persons who have no. ideas beyond filling their own pockets, and it may be expected that he will only obey their orders so far as it suits him.He appreciates, however, the necessity of establishing a strong Government in Adis Abeba but his support of Ras Taffari will probably be as from a practically independent Prince treating with his equal. There is no question of the genuineness of his haired for the Turks and Germans. He told the British Minister that, before leaving, he intended to see the Empress in the presence of Ras Taffari and Has Seyyum and urge upon her the necessity of friendship with the three Powers wdio are her neighbours, and of putting an end to German intrigues even by dismissing the Germans and Turks from the country, pointing out that if Abyssinia delays giving proof of her friendship until the victory of the Entente Powers is absolutely certain, the gift will then be valueless. In Ras Hailu&apos;s own words &quot;If England, France and Italy are to die, let us die with them, as the victory of Germany would mean the return of Lij Yasu who would establish a Moslem kingdom under the protection of Germany and Turkey.&quot;The baneful activities of the outlaw, Kedani (see p. 295), are happily ended by his death in the course of a raid into British territory&apos;. About the middle of June, strong parties of Ogaden Rer Ali collected at Segudan just beyond our borders, where they were joined by Kedani and part of his Abyssinian following. Our western tribes, anticipating attack, took all necessary precaution and divided their riflemen and spearmen into two parties. When the attack was made at Warmarali, some ten miles within our territory, the first party adopted the usual Somali tactics of falling back and stimulating defeat. The raiders pressed on too eagerly, and were drawn into an ambush and outnumbered by the other party. Kedani and twenty-five Abyssinians were killed, and the rest fled. A dangerous and troublesome personality is thus removed from our Northern frontier.We also hear from French sources that it is believed that two Germans who lately got out of Adis Abeba, perhaps Avith the intention of joining Lij Yasu, but, failing, took refuge among the tribes somewdiere near Tajura, are being forced by lack of food to return to Abyssinia.. If this is true, another source of potential (rouble is removed.The question of Tigre has now been settled in so far as the re-distribution of provinces is concerned.    Has Sejwxun has been
confirmed in the Rulership of Tigre and the districts o  Aksum, Nevket and Shire have been added to his province, but as a safe-guard Dejaz Guksa, with the title of Ras, has been given the province which, when taken from Fitaurari Gabri Selassi after his fight with Ras Sibhat, was given to Ras finer who is now with Lij Yasu in Magdala.The district of the two Tawlalo has been also given to Dejaz Tetla.The arrangement seems to be a satisfactory one as both Rases are contented to have made friends and the Government believe that they have guaranteed the future good behaviour of Ras Seyyum by placing on his borders Ras Guksa, his former rival, and Dejaz Tetla, who can overwhelm Tigre on the slightest sign of insubordination.It is not certain whether Ras Seyyum and Ras Guksa will now be aUowed to proceed north or whether they are still to be detained here in Adis Abeba until Lij Yasu is caught.Dejazmatch Jotei has been dismissed and. Gedami, occupied by officials of Dejazmatch Kumsa on behalf of the Regent whose representative has left Aclis Abeba.
NOTES.Rumoured Defeat of the Idrisi.Kamaran reports a rumour that, in the early part of June, the Idrisi forces, after surrounding Ibn Tawwab and some 600-700 Turkish troops, were surprised in their sleep and defeated, but succeeded in holding their ground. No reliable account has however, yet been received, and Idrisi himself says nothing.Abu Ras.From further details received about the execution of Abu Ras (see p. 304) one may conclude that he only got his deserts from the Turkish point of view, it seems that he sent a party of fifteen armed men to the camp of Ibn Nasir Muqbil, to kill him. The party duly fired off a volley, killing five soldiers and three other Arabs, but their chief quarry escaped. Abu Ras then waylaid and robbed a Turkish money convoj7 from Taiz, and eventually, after eluding a punitive force sent by the Turks, he went with a party and fired at the Turkish camp near Taiz, when both he and his son were captured and executed.Money for Yemen.The arrival of the money at Sanaa, reported on page 270, is further confirmed by a Greek who escaped from Hocleidah. He says that the Imam refused to change any notes for the Turks. They talked of sending some of these to be sold at half-price at Hocleidah. As the current rate there for a  5 Turkish note is only Rs. 17 to 18, as against its normal value of Rs. 67, bidding is scarcely likely to be keen. The same informant says that large quantities of goods reach Hodeidah, and that the import dues amount to 1,000 to 2,000 dollars claiW.77ie New Movement.This appears to be progressing. Kamaran reports that a meeting has taken place at Amran between Hizam Pasha, of the Bekil and Ali Miqdad of the Anis, already mentioned (p. 256) as members of the confederacy, and the Sheikh of the Beni Matar. The Idrisi is said to be supplying Hizam with arms and ammunition.Kaid Ahmed.We may briefly note here that Aden has replied negatively to a query raised on page 257 as to whether Kaid Ahmed of Hajariyah, another of the notables of the newr confederacy, is the son of Ahmed Naaman, the late Kaimmakam of this district. It appears that he is the son of a, former Kaimmakam, Ahmed bin Qasim, the succession to whom, as Kaimmakam, Ahmed Naaman. by intrigues secured for himself to the exclusion of his predecessors family.
