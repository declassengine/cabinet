Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the 10th March [Nos. 14 and 16] that be would be leaving for Moscow on the night of the llth; be intended to remain in that city so long as the Government, which would make it its headquarters, retained its power there.M. Trotsky. Mr. Lockhart also said that M. Trotsky&apos;s resignation was the result of a sharp discussion between the two parties in the Soviet in regard to the ratification of the peace treaty by the Congress, which appeared to be practically certain. M. Trotsky declared for immediate war, but M. Lenin thought that Russia should gain all the time possible. The latter prevailed, but M. Trotsky&apos;s resignation must not be taken too seriously. He was still a member of the Council of Commissaries. * MM. Chicherin and Karachan, both of whom were delegates at Brest, had taken, his place at the Foreign Office, to which, however, he might return at any time.Odessa.Removal of Consulate-General.  The British consul at Kherson telegraphed on the 8th March that the consulate general had been removed to Kherson owing to the possibility of Odessa being occupied by Austrian troops. He added : &quot; I shall remain here as long as possible ancl then proceed to Mariupol, where Vice-Consul Faite has gone with a party of British subjects.&quot;POLAND.Germany and Poland. Sir W. Townley has sent [No. 1006] the following report of a debate on Poland in the Prussian Landtag on the 6th March : Dr. Seyde (Pole) said that on the 25th February, 1918, the Chancellor had said in the German Beichstag, with reference to the fixing of the western frontiers of the[8^8-86] B
Kingdom of Poland, &quot; From the German side, when the question of frontiers came to he settled, only that which was essentially indispensable tor military reasons would be claimed.&quot; With these words a policy of annexation was proclaimed which would make the peuceable and friendly co-existence of the German and Polish peoples impossible. They, the representatives of the Polish people in that House, shared their indignation to the full, and solemnly protested against this act of violence against the Polish nation.Dr. Wolff Gorki (Conservative) said that the Poles spoke of the Cholm district, but Gnesen and Posen concerned them far more nearly: they would do everything they could to recover those. But that, of course, was out of question : it would be suicide on their part. They were trying to turn the Government from its former attitude of conciliation towards the Poles, but it would not listen.Vice-President, Dr. Friedberg, said that as the law of expropriation was only a sword of Damocles, and as it was resented by the Poles the time had come to remove that cause of provocation. Deputy Seyde had proclaimed himself a representative of the Polish nation in Prussia ; he himself did not recognise that firm, as he knew Prussian deputies only. There were no representatives of the Polish nation there, either according to law or from the national standpoint. They cherished no illusions: they knew quite well that only small groups of Poles desired an understanding with them. Deputy Seyde had objected to the cession of Cholm to Ukrainia; but what he and his friends thought of the peace concluded with Ukrainia left the speaker cold. He did not know what the Poles themselves had done to free their country from the Russian yoke. They owed that result to the Central Powers. No thanks were asked for on that head, but one point must be insisted on, the existence and life conditions of the Fatherland would not be settled to suit Polish wishes but exclusively to suit their own requirements.Fuhrmann (National Liberal) said that anyone who believed in reconciliation with the Poles after what had been endured from them both at home and abroad was an idealist it would be necessary to reflect before establishing an independent Poland on their ilank. Germany could never forgo the frontier districts in the east if she meant to maintain her position as a great Power. The new order of things in the east must be regulated solely from the German view-point the Polish representatives had declared that if Hertling contemplated the acquisition of military guarantees on the western frontier then the tablecloth would be torn between us and them. Things could hardly be worse than they were now ; but should they become worse then the great majority of that House would remember that it had German interests to defend. If a battle were forced upon them it would be accepted and carried through, so that in the future a kingdom of Prussia might exist which was in a position to fulfil its duty towards the German Empire.SERBIA.Declaration as to the Policy of the Allies. Sir C. des Graz telegraphed from Corfu on the 8th March [No. 39] that M. Pashitch had asked whether, when explaining his policy in the Skuptchina, he might, if necessary, say that the victory of the Allies would mean not merely the restoration of Serbia, but, so tar as possible, the realisation of its vital national aspirations. Telegraphing on the 11th March [No. 21] Mr. Balfour consented to this being done.TURKEY.Plans for the Future. A highly placed Turkish diplomat informed an agent : (1) That Turkey demanded an indemnity from Russia, the amount of which had not been fixed; when paid it would be reserved for the construction of railways in Anatolia. (2) That in regard to the Caucasus, the Turkish policy was to conclude an agreement by which a Turkish protectorate would be established in the territories which  were given as a guarantee to Russia. (3) Autonomy would be granted to Palestine under Turkish suzerainty so that contact with Egypt might be maintained.The Chivalrous Turk. In a despatch dated the 15th February, Sir H. Rumbold said that he had travelled two days previously from Often to Brienne with the prisoners of war who had been repatriated from Turkey, all of whom had spoken with the greatest dislike of the Turks and their brutal methods.
ABYSSINIA.Negotiations for the Expulsion of Enemy Subjects. Mr. Campbell telegraphed from Adis Abeba on the 4th March [No. 25] that his Italian colleague had been, informed by bis Government that, on condition of a. rupture with the Central Powers and only on that condition, it had agreed to a grant of 3,000 rifles as requested. [See E.R., XL, p. 5 ; XLV, p. 4 ; XLVEI, p. 2 ; XLYIII, p. 4]. His Italian colleague contended that these rifles were for Has personally, and Pas had not sufficient authority to force Abyssinia to agree to a rupture without some benefit to itself. This view Mr. Campbell thought reasonable. The grant of 3,000 rifles would not, in itself, be sufficient to secure a rupture.Mr. Balfour replied to this on the 11th March [No. 353] saying that he considered the only course was to make the offer agreed upon, and in the event of a refusal to, if necessary, consider the matter further.Mr. Campbell referred in bis telegram to a demand made by the French for the inclusion of the rifles [? 16,000] still at Jibuti; and Mr. Balfour hoped that this obstacle (as to which lie had been officially informed by the Italian Government) would be removed.SIBERIA.Bolsheviks and Germans. Sir C. Greene transmitted [No. 214] on the 12th March a telegram from the military attache saying that the organisation of prisoners at Irkutsk would soon constitute a serious menace ; it was still uncertain as to whether German officers &quot;had been sent there for this work, but he had been informed by the general staff that the Bolsheviks opposed to Semenoff were organised and led by German prisoners of war and that the Bolshevik artillery was served by them exclusively.PERSIA.British Policy-On the 7th March Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 132] to Sir C. Marling as follows : &quot; The present situation in Persia has been engaging the earnest consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government, who have desired nothing so much as a Cabinet at Teheran capable of preserving Persia&apos;s neutrality and maintaining order throughout the country, and who have recently reaffirmed publicly their unqualified adhesion to the principle of Persian independence.&quot; I have accordingly instructed you on many recent occasions to enter into friendly discussions with the Persian Government. All that was asked of them was that they should manifest a spirit of general friendliness to British interests and due regard to our representations ; that they should take measures to secure Persia against a recurrence of the situation brought about by enemy activities in the autumn and -early winter of 1915, when the country was overrun by enemy agents and marauding bands; and, lastly, in view of the predominant interests of Great Britain in South Persia and the chaos which would result from the absence of any organised force, that they should formally recognise the South Persia Rifles, for which His Majesty&apos;s Government have continued to bear the charge, as at present constituted, until the end of the war.&quot; On their side, His Majesty&apos;s Government have been prepared to offer financial assistance to the Persian Government on an enhanced and liberal scale ; to favour the creation after the war of a uniform military force for the whole country, in which the South Persia Rifles should be eventually incorporated under foreign officers of a nationality to be determined hereafter ; to treat the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 as in suspense pending the creation of a duly constituted Government in Russia, with whom its abrogation could be formally discussed ; to accede to the withdrawal by Persia of her recognition of the convention; to agree to the revision of the customs tariff with Persia; and, in accordance with the expressed wishes of the Persian Government,, to welcome the presence of Persian representatives at any international conference to which non-belligerents might be invited.&quot; These offers; which are still open, have not so far met with acceptance from the Persian Government. On the other hand, lawlessness is rife. The Turks have entered Western Azerbaijan at various points. The Jangalis have practically severed connection between the capital and Enzeli, and His Majesty&apos;s consul at Resht is in personal danger.   In fact, North-West Persia from the Caspian to the Turkish, border
is either in a state of active disorder or is exposed to hostile movements which dominate the northern approaches to the capital, effectively threaten the neutrality of the Persian Government, and constitute a serious menace to the interests which His Majesty&apos;s Government are endeavouring to defend in Persia.&quot; In view of this situation, daily growing worse, His Majesty&apos;s Government have been reluctantly forced to the conclusion that they must make themselves responsible for the measures of protection against a common danger which the Persian Government are either unable or unwilling to adopt. They have decided to despatch a sufficient force of British troops from the Turkish frontier at Khanikin to patrol and keep open the road from the frontier to the north-east. The point to which they will advance will depend upon the steadying influence which the presence of this detachment will be found to exert, and upon the degree of authority exercised by the Persian Govern-ment themselves.&quot;You should make a communication to the Persian Government in the above sense, and should inform them that the temporary character of this arrangement is frankly recognised by His Majesty&apos;s Government; that it will be carried out with every possible care to avoid any infringement of Persian independence and integrity, or interference in internal administration; and that the British forces will be withdrawn as soon as circumstances permit, and in any case at the end of the war.&quot;Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 11th March [No. 206] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs bad made no comment on the note, which he had presented that day ; he had apparently expected it.Situation in North-Wast Persia. On the 6th March Sir C. Marling reported [No. 186] the capture b)&apos; Jangalis of the British vice-consul at Resht. The fact, he said, seemed certain, though he could get no direct news, and the French consul had been instructed to take charge of British interests. Ou the following day he reported further that the vice-consul and the manager of the Imperial Hank of Persia had been taken to Kasma; the Government had informed bim as to this and had expressed its regret, adding that it was trying to procure their release. Telegraphing again on the 10th [No. 201], he said that in a letter from Kuchik Khan [? to Obeidulla] it was stated that the captives would be detained till Su eiman Mirza was released.In regard to the disturbance at Tabriz mentioned in List week&apos;s report [p. 6], Sir C. Marling, telegraphing on the 7th March [No. 188], said that on that occasion the Syrians had been guilty ot many excesses; they had got the upper hand, and in com-compliance with their orders the Moslems were being disarmed. It was feared that the truce was only temporary. Plis information came from the American consul, who also said that 100 Syrians and several hundred Mosiems had been killed.Telegraphing again on the 9th and 10th March [Nos. 196, 1;&apos;7, and 200], he said : (1) that the acting consul at Tabriz had reported that the Democrats were becoming more and more menacing towards the British ; (2) that information had been received of the seizure of Ardebil by the Jangalis; and (3; that the situation at Kasviu was somewhat disquieting.On the 10th he also reported [No. 2C2] that the following had been received from ITamadan : &quot; Famine increasing ; starving villagers flock to (? town) ; starving people useful to Extremists. &apos; If we (? assisted), we should have whole of the people on our side.   About 100,00uZ. necessary to support populace till harvest.&quot;Changes in the Ministry. Sir G, Marling telegraphed on the 11th March [No. 204] that Mustofi-ul-Mamalek had resumed office ; that Mukhber-ul-MuIk had retired from the Ministry of Finance in favour of the under-secretary ; and that Mukhber-es-Sultaneh had become Minister of the Interior.The Persian Cossacks. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 9th March [No. 194] that he had been informed by the Russian commander of the Persian Cossacks that he had refused a renewed proposal that the Prussian officers should serve under contract with the Persian Government. Also that Prince Nasredin Mirza had been appointed, honorary chief of the brigade ; he was an absolute nonentity, but Sir C. Marling did not see how the Russian commander could get the appointment cancelled.Payment of Russian Troops. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir C. Marling on the 8th March [No. 136], in reply to a telegram sent by the latter on the 3rd March,.
authorising the continuance of the payment of the Russian troops. His previous decision [see E.R. LVIII, p. 6] had, he said, been reconsidered in the light of the arguments urged by Sir C. Marling.Persian Politicians in Berlin. Sir W. Townley telegraphed from The Hague on the 9th March [No. 1009J, that the &quot; Norddeutsche&quot; stated that three prominent Persian politicians bad arrived in Berlin on a visit, which was expected to last a fortnight. They were South Persians, Seyed Mohammed Reza Nossawat, editor of a well-known Persian newspaper, Nasir-ul-Islam, representative of an aristocratic family of Resht, and Mirza Mohammed Ali Khan Club (?), formerly financial agent at Hamadan. These three gentlemen, who had undertaken their journey with a view to the study of German institutions, were formerly members of Parliament. Mossawat was one of the most capable heads of the Democratic Party, and had just been reappointed a deputy in the fourth Persian Parliament now sitting in Teheran. In this connection it might be mentioned that the new Persian Cabinet was supported by the greatly strengthened Democratic Party, so that henceforth hopes might justifiably be felt that there might be fruitful co-operation between the Government and Parliament.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.RUSSIA.M. Trotsky. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed from Petrograd on the 12th March [No. 17] that M. Trotsky (who was not going to the Congress at Moscow) was virtually dictator of Petrograd. He had been placed at the head of the new revolutionary committee.APPENDIX I.Russia during the Past Fourteen Months.It is now a year since the outbreak of the Russian revolution, and it will be interesting to reproduce the appreciations which have been attached to the reports during that period.January 31, 1917.During the past ten days there has been little or no reference in the Petrograd embassy telegrams to the internal political situation in Russia, which would appear to indicate a lull supervening on the storm which followed Basputin&apos;s suppression.February 14, 1917.The internal political situation shows little change this week.February 21, 1917.It is to be noted that there has been no internal political news from Russia for two weeks. Although it is impossible to anticipate what may occur, the lull since the suppression of Ratputin is all to the good.February 28, 1917.The reopening of the Duma will mark a critical period in Russian internal politics. March 22, 1917.In the report will be found a chronological account of the events which took place in Petrograd between the 9th March, when the Empire was in existence, and the 20th March, when the ex-Emperor was arrested.It is impossible to gauge either the human motives, the psychological forces, or the fundamental factors which have contributed to produce these events.   It is probably[898-86] C
hot an over-statement to say that the catastrophe which has befallen the Russian Empire is a more prodigious historical event than the fall of the old regime in France The ignorance of the Russian multitudes, the lack of administrative experience charac-teristic of most Russian politicians, the occult nature of the secret forces working on the side of revolution and reaction, and the effect of the disappearance of the traditional bond of paternal discipline, which ran from the Emperor to the lowest grade of the army, are elements which defy scrutiny.From the point of view of the prosecution of the war there are two outstanding points 1. The effect of the revolution on the discipline of the Russian army, on the authority of its high command, and on the military appointments made by the Government.2. The effect of the revolution on Germany.If the result of the Russian revolution be to provoke a serious anti-dynastic movement in Germany, then the first point becomes of small importance; if, on the other hand, the rulers of Germany retain their hold unimpaired, then the question of the maintenance of the Russian army in a state of ,,obedience and mobility outbalances all other considerations.In regard to M. Kerensky&apos;s statement that &quot; M. Miliukoff was not to be believed when he said Russia wanted Constantinople,&quot; it must be remembered that no revolution can alter geographical facts. In this instance the geographical facts are that Russia is ice-bound on the north and desert-bound on the south, so that the Straits form the only available outlet for the Autocracy, Empire, Monarchy, Commonwealth, Republic, Commune, Communal Federation, or the Slav unit in the United States of Europe, or whatever Government may be produced by the ferment at present working in Russia.In regard to the whole movement in Russia it is worth mentioning that press telegrams from Russia will repay careful study, as, although many are probably devoid of serious foundation, they show the tendency of thought of the people who influence those who compose the communications.March 29, 1917.In reading the summary of Russian telegrams one point must be borne in mind, and that is, that the senders are all subjected to the local atmosphere of Petrograd. In Petrograd itself there can be no doubt that matters are in a bad way. With the noblest intentions it is impossible fur an army to do any good if it is subject to no authority either of its own or anyone else&apos;s devising. The Russian revolution bears many points of resemblance to the Turkish revolution, but with this fundamental difference, that the secret forces in control in Constantinople were determined to keep the army in a state of discipline and order as an instrument, while the secret forces in Petrograd -seem equally detenmined to promote a state of paralysis in the army as a stepping-stone to anarchy. The officers, it is plain, are completely at sea, and have not only lost all authority, but are ready to compromise with the mutineers and only too glad to get out of their uniforms as a way of avoiding insults. This is the state of affairs in Petrograd, what it may be in the provinces it is hard to tell ; doubtless, superficially, things are better outside Petrograd than within it, but it is impossible to say whether this is because the old wheels though closing down are still spinning, or whether a vital spark of belief in a Prussia without an Emperor actually exists and inspires masses of people who have never dreamt of such a thing before.April 4, 1917.The course of the revolution now runs in an obscure channel. It would be interesting and useful to know 1. What is the psychological condition of Moscow.2. What effect the revolution is having on the religious habits of the people. 3. What is taking place in the Moslem areas.The declaration of the independence of Poland and Finland should be noted ; it will have its effect in America.
April 12, 1017.The position of the Russian Provisional Government is still far from reassuring ; it is still quite unable to control the spread of dangerous propaganda by the extremists, and though the most recent telegrams regarding the proclamation issued by the Soldiers&apos; and Officers&apos; Committee is more hopeful, it is not possible to foresee an early restoration of essential discipline in the Russian navy, armies, or depbts. The spread of revolutionary action to the Caucasus armies is significant and most regrettable.* * * * * *April IP, 1917.The declarations of Prince Lvow regarding war aims are evidently temporising, and have been made intentionally vague with a view to avoiding anything calculated to alienate the Socialist and extreme elements from a desire to carry on the war. Until the situation in the capital improves, any public declaration regarding Russian territorial ambitions in Turkey is probably deliberately and wisely withheld.The executive power of the Government in Petrograd itself is evidently still ineffective, as may be judged from the significant telegram regarding the price of bread and the pay of the militia. The northern armies in front of Riga and Dvinsk are still in a deplorable state.******April 26, 1917.The division of opinion in the Russian Government regarding the future of Con-stantinople is most significant. We have been too ready to see in Russia&apos;s former aspirations a desire for &quot;an economic outlet. This desire has in Russia always been secondary to the religious and national sentiment, which centred round the idea of the Czar seated on the throne of Constantine.* * * * * &quot;! *With regard to the internal condition of Russia, the telegrams received during the last week from various sources all tend to show a distinct improvement in the state of affairs, and lead one to hope that the worst is over.May 3, 1917.The political situation in Prussia, both as regards internal and more especially external policy, still gives rise to very serious apprehension. The loss of Mush and the inactivity of the Caucasus armies does not encourage one regarding the military situation. It is clear that the extremists have power to dictate the foreign policy of the Provisional Government, and that any attempt to force M. Miliukoffs hand into making a public or even diplomatic declaration regarding &quot; annexation &quot; or &quot; liberation &quot; would be disastrous.******May 10, 1917.During the last week the Provisional Government has passed through a, crisis, and, by obtaining the support of a small majority of the delegates of the Petrograd Committee of Soldiers and Workmen, it has survived..-Jfc tfr &apos;/r ^ -XsThe disruptive tendencies of the revolution are manifest not only in the fleet and the greater part of the Russian armies, but in the unity of the Russian Empire. The people of Little Russia or the Ukraine are talking of separating themselves from the remainder. Now that the Crown has gone and no strong central Government has taken its place the Baltic peoples are turning their thoughts towards local autonomy, while even the Boles, divided from the direct influences of the revolution by the wall of German soldiery, are beginning to doubt the feasibdity of a B/ussian Republics assistance in securing their national ideals.The position in brief would seem to be that the real direction and power reside with the inner Committee of the Council of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Delegates who control
&quot;the Petrograd garrison, while the Provisional Government is tolerated only as long as. and in so far as, it &quot; toes the line.&quot;May 17, 1917.During the last week the Provisional Government has been enlarged bv the addition of new men from the ranks of Socialist parties, and two of the most notable figures in the first Provisional Government have been compelled to resign, viz., M. Gonchkoff, the late Minister for War, and M. Miliukoff, the late Minister for Foreign Affairs. To fill these two most important offices come M. Kerensky, hitherto Minister of Justice, and M. Tereschenko, hitherto Minister of Finance. Upon these two men now rests the gigantic responsibility of Russia&apos;s future part in the present war. M. Kerensky was the one man in the first Provisional Government who seems to have had real influence with the forces of the proletariat in Petrograd, and to have had some measure of their confidence.May 24, 1917.The new Coalition Government, the constitution of which was outlined in last week&apos;s appreciation, offers us the last hope of saving the military situation on the Russian front this summer. If this new Government fails nothing short of anarclry and disintegration can follow. The Workmen&apos;s Council remains the all-important factor, not only in Petrograd bat also in all the main towns of Russia, and the inclusion of some of the responsible leaders of this Council in the Government is at least a step in the direction of combining power and responsibility in the same hands.* * * * --?) *The land problem, affecting as it does the chief personal, interests of the soldiers at the front and the great mass of the Russian people, is the most difficult cpzestion raised by the revolution. An all-Russia Peasant Congress has been sitting in Petrograd, and its demands are that all land shall be shared among those that work it, and that no family shall have more land than it can work itself. There are already reports that the landowners, feeling that they may soon be dispossessed of their lands, have neglected sowings, and are trying to realise as much as they can by cutting down their forests.   The former course may result in a very serious menace of famine.ft would seem that if such attempts are to be made to alter during the war the whole structure of Russian local, social, and economic life new causes of danger and discontent will be inevitablv aroused. Already the cry from the armies that they are peasants first and soldiers afterwards is reported, and under such circumstances the restoration of army discipline will be difficult.May 31, 1917.If the Russian Government decide to publish the proposed secret offensive treaty between the late Emperor and the Kaiser, the last shreds of sympathy felt in this country for the former will disappear. But we must remember that any , such publication will ant as a spur to the growing suspicion among the democracies of the worLl against what is termed the secret control of foreign policy by departmental oligarchies.June 7, 1917.Reports from various sources in Russia are anything but encouraging. M. Kerensky&apos;s triumphal tour cannot be regarded as being likely to have any very lasting effect. The vast mass of the proletariat are thinking not ahout the war but about the division of land, higher wages, and shorter hours of labour. Industrial trouble is general, and if the Provisional Government are unable to assert their authority in Kronstadt, how can they be expected to have any real control elsewhere ? At any rate the situation is one of extreme instability, and neither generals nor Ministers can look forward to any term of office with assurance.
June 21, 1917.The situation in Russia has as yet produced no reliable indication as to the final turn for order or anarchy which events may take. However, it is possible that next week matters may have assumed a more favourable complexion.June 28, 1917.Colonel Marsh&apos;s suggestion in regard to Armenians in the Caucasus is important. In the Armenians we have a people of intelligence and capacity who desire victoiy for the Allies and, owing to previous experience, are less influenced by theoretical ideas than most people in Russia. It might be of value to mention this movement to the French, who are especially interested in Armenia, and have already a very satisfactory Armenian battalion established in Cyprus.The news in regard to the Black Sea fleet is regrettable, as this unit had hitherto shown a good fighting spirit, and a, desire to defeat the enemy.July 5, 1917.The whole of the matter included under this head deserves careful reading. The situation of course does not yet tend to any definite solution, but at least General BriisilofFs offensive has demonstrated the existence of a real national feeling; in the Russian people. This is a matter of gre it importance, as many observers doubted whether the idea of nationality would survive the disappearance of the external symbols of national existence.If Russia dropped in value from 40 to 11 after the revolution, she may be said to have risen from 11 to I 7 as the result of General BrusilofPs success. Whether this will be maintained or increased depends on many circumstances, both moral and material. However, the capacity to rise is an established fact, and the probability of Russia being a great post-war Power is materially increased.July 11, 1917.The Russian offensive as chronicled in the press should be followed carefully, as it is the safest index of Russian vitality. The suggestions of the would-be Russian delegates to Great Britain that the inhabitants of Turkey should decide as to the form of Government they desired is most likely prompted by pro-German feelings rather than philosophic democratic ideals. The proposed Armenian force is a most useful suggestion and one which may give real vitality to the Russian operations on the Caucasus front.July 19, 1917.Thee is nothing of moment in the official news covering the crisis in Russia which is not in the daily newspapers. The events are obscure and confused, but apparently such organisation as exists lies in the hands of elements more or less predisposed in favour of a Government and national existence as opposed to the purely animal and anarchistic forces.July 26, 1917.There can be little doubt that Kerensky has an uphill fight in front of him; Petrograd is teeming with German agents, and the mass of the Russian armies and people want peace at almost any price. He is faced with chaos within and a well-disciplined and organised foe without.****** August 2, 1917.There are now indications that Russia is tending towards a resuscitation of law, order, and discipline. The German advance and the Russian retreat appear to have combined to rob the elements of pro-Germanism and anarchy of much of their popularity. It must, however, be remembered that a return of discipline to the army will bd regarded by the &quot;intellectuals &quot; as partaking of the nature of &quot;reaction,&quot;0 and will be resisted. However, unless some untoward event occurs, it is quite possible that, following on the exhaustion of the volcanic forces of anarchy, a period of reason will follow during which the military forces of Russia may be considerably rehabilitated.* This mo:-t misleading- word should be expuuged from the political sfcudent&apos;s dictionary. The anarchist who desires to return to a nut diet in the virgin forest regards policemen and ticket-collectors as reactionary institutions.[898-86] D
August 9, 1917.The account of the recent ministerial crisis should be read with care, it is incapable of summary. The best that can be said is that it shows a growing tendencjr towards a desire for government in place of anarchy.August 16, 1917.This week&apos;s news is not very good reading. The members of the Russian Govern-ment do not show a real readiness to face their difficulties and deal with realities. The talk about gradually restoring discipline as if it were possible to compromise on the subject recalls the attitude of &quot; the Martinet &quot; in the &quot; Bab Ballads.&quot;4&quot;They do not seem to understand that it is impossible to countenance a mild indisci-pline, and that there is no halfway house between obedience and rebellion. Next week should show whether the hopes of General Korniloff&apos;s capacity to re-establish authority are well founded. M. Kerensky&apos;s changes of attitude in regard to the Stockholm Conference seem to show that he is influenced by the cries of demagogues and the whims of assemblies.August 23, 1917.Mr. Balfour&apos;s telegram (No. 1709 of the 16th August), making it clear that there is no intention of our weakening in our efforts to assist Russia in the matter of heavy guns and war material, is important and should do much to remove the fear that existed in the minds of some of the war party in Prussia that we were not fulfilling our promises in these matters.The report regarding the condition of the Murman railway is most satisfactory, but the problem of the winter food supply of Petrograd and the northern towns will be very grave.August 29, 1917.The telegrams regarding the crisis arising out of the soviet&apos;s unwillingness to abow Korniloff the necessary powers to enforce discipline throughout the Russian armies do not throw much further light upon the situation. The press reports of the proceedings of the Moscow Conference have been full, and have revealed the singular difficulty of M. Kerensky&apos;s position at this moment.   The Soviets are veering &quot; left.&quot;It is most earnestly hoped that nothing will come of the idea of an exchange of able-bodied prisoners of war between Austria and Russia.The telegram regarding the Petrograd police is significant and important. Unless order can. be secured in the capital, when famine begins to threaten, the result may prove disastrous in the extreme.September C, 1917.Great interest attaches to the telegrams received from Sir George Buchanan, regarding the Moscow Conference and the future of the Government.o oSeptember 14, 1917.According to the latest telegrams, General Korniloff has actually surrendered, and the episode is at an end.The whole of the Russian news should be read, as this report contains a good summary of the Korniloff-Keren sky affair. It is to be noted that revolution in Russia is-working on rather different grounds than revolutions in other countries heretofore. The autocratic power of the Emperor, which provided the moral sanction for administration, has disappeared, and nothing has taken its place. In America and France, the two countries where revolutions have worked, the successors to power invented or retained a moral sanction sufficient to enable them to carry on the ordinary routine of life. In Prussia this is not the case ; the Duma is doomed because it was instituted by the Emperor,, the Soviet is manifestly merely an assembly of self-appointed personages, and the Constituent Assembly remains a dream. The Russian Revolution is therefore a grand negation of authority, and lacks any positive purpose or intention. g$%. Amidst such fundamental and primitive chaos it is next to impossible to ascertain what has actually occurred, and quite impossible to say what may occur. The great &apos; weakness of both parties is the really outstanding symptom ; it is manifest that there&quot; Even he who smote his officer for punishment was booked, And mutinies upon the seas he rarely overlooked !&quot;
have been moments when General Korniloff could have taken Petrograd with a very small effort; on the other hand, it would seem that he has been unable to exert even that slight amount of energy.September 19, 1917.Russia is now officially styled a. republic. The authority for the establishment of the republic is the Provisional Government. This action has not the sanction of the foreshadowed constituent assembly ; this may be important at some future date when the authority of the republic is questioned.Sir G. Buchanan&apos;s telegram No. 1456 is interesting. It is more than likely that General Korniloff acted under the stimulus of agents provocateur, who wished to abort any recrudescence of law and order.September 26, 1917.There is nothing of importance to comment on in Russia this week ; the postpone-ment of the Soviet meeting on Tuesday, the 25th, leaves everything in doubt.October 4, 1917.Political events continue to drift from crisis to crisis. There is no use in commenting on the passionate outcries of speakers like M. Kerensky and his opponents. The really important news is to be found in the last sentence of the latest intelli-gence from Russia. This sentence runs as follows : &quot; The news of the 29th September from Tashkent and other places is very bad, and anarchy appears to be spreading.&quot; There is every indication that the pan-Turanian movement is at last getting to work in Turkestan, and it is submitted in all seriousness that we may not be at any great historical distance from seeing a powerful Turkish State menacing Afghanistan. This movement will not probably tend to anarchy, as the telegram quoted suggests, but to aggressive well-organised militarism based upon national rsentiment and fanaticism.October 11, 1917.There is nothing to add to last week&apos;s appreciation. We have no news from Tashkent.October 18, 1917.There is nothing of political consequence to comment on in the official telegram. The Finnish movements and the Gulf of Riga operations should be noted. A press telegram describes the internal anarchy prevailing in Eastern Russia in gloomy terms. It would be of great interest to ascertain what is going on in the Turanian areas of Russia.October 25, 1917.The Soviet peace proposals contain one interesting item from an oriental point of view, inasmuch as Armenian autonomy figures second on the list. This concession to Armenia is satisfactory, inasmuch as the Soviet does not, as might be feared, agree to handing back the Armenians to the Turks.November 1, 1917.The views of the resident Englishman should be read. Like many others, he was, it is understood, enthusiastic for a change of regime ; he is now probably equally gloomy on the result of change.November 8, 1917.It is impossible to comment on the Russian situation ; the long-awaited crisis seems at last to have arisen.November 16, 1917.The Department of Information (Foreign Office) replies this week to the note furnished by the Foreign Office and published in Eastern Report No. XL.It is impossible to make any observation on the Russian situation, which is now so bad that it is difficult for it not to improve.
November 22, 1917. Chaos continues.November 29, 1917.The news from Russia differs in no respect from what is to be read in the papers.. One point, however, is worth bearing in mind, and that is that, the forces seemingly in control iu Russia, if actually in contact with German officialism, will prove unpleasant companions.No matter how much German money has been spent in bringing about the revolution in Russia, it has not altered the revolutionaries&apos; intentions of bringing about a revolution in Germany.December C, 1917.The Russian situation has in the last week developed somewhat on the lines indicated in the Appreciation of the last report. It is evident that the Germans are in something of a quandary in discussing terms with anarchists who are avowedly out for the overthrow of all organised government. They are also confronted with the unpleasant problem of having to part with their millions of docile, hard-working Russian prisoners, who are all engaged in war work, in return for masses of war-weary, revolution-infected Austrians of various races, and, in addition, risking disorganising their industry and railway machinery in the process. The Bolsheviks pass from folly and villainy to villainy and folly. The murder of General Dukhonin, the appeal to Indian Moslems to rise, and the announcement that if-the constituent assembly does not fall in with their views it will be suppressed all go to show that we are dealing with a band of persons who are not going to be bound by any very close adherence to the obvinus meaning of the words proletariat, democracy, or humanity.As against this the report of the pro-British demonstration in Odessa, the escape of General Korniloff, and the election returns go to show that the Bolsheviks are not by any means all-powerful.December 20, 1917.The Russian situation is more obscure than ever, and will remain so until something more like a decision has been reached between the Bolsheviks and the Ukraine. Upon the latter the Cossack and Caucasus position must largely depend, geographically, politically, and economic. The Bolshevik forces include the crews of fleets, and in the Black Sea this fact is serious.^ .*XS *^&apos; . $feDecember 27, 1917.Very interesting comment on the Russian situation is contained in a telegram from the &quot;Times&quot; correspondent at Washington, dated the 27th December (&quot;Times,&quot; 28th December1. This telegram speaks of the anxiety felt in America &quot;because of the accumulation of evidence that the Bolshevist leaders are planning a world-wide social revolution, and that they are as anxious as the Kaiser himself to destroy democratic institutions.&quot; He adds: &quot;The i&apos;nited States Government is now in possession of evidence of&quot; a conspiracy of the Bolshevists to come to America in order to spread the doctrine of communal organisation by direct action.&quot;****** January 3, 1918.The Russian situation is undergoing a very interesting and subtle change. Although the anarchy and and chaos is superficially what it was before, certain quite encouraging symptoms are beginning to appear.The Bolsheviks are breaking Irom the Germans.The Ukrainian forces are apparently consolidating.The general tendency among Georgians and Armenians is towards organisation and resistance.The sum of all these developments has a tendency to produce a pro-Entente and. anti-Central Power atmosphere.It may be asked to what this curious change may be attributed, and the answer perhaps is that the Jewish element is silently working for us as a result of our Zionist declaration.Special attention is drawn to the alleged propaganda of the &quot; Daily News &quot; correspondent in Petrograd.
January 10, 1918.Mr. Lindley&apos;s telegram of the 7th January (No. 58) is most interesting and confirms previous estimates that have been formed here regarding the principles and aims of the Bolshevik leaders.Besides Trotsky and Lenin there is another anti-national Jew named Radek, whose influence seems to be growing. Radek has loner been in touch with German Socialists, and his main aim seems to be to assist in the spread of the &quot; Gospel according to Karl Marx&quot; in Germany.    He writes in the &quot; Pravda.&quot;January 17, 1918.The revolution runs its course. The arrest of the Roumanian Minister is perhaps less surprising than his release. However, it is to be noted that, considering the extreme views of the revolutionaries, the smallness of the actual terrorism is interesting; it may be that extensive lynchings, proscriptions, &amp;c, may be indulged in before the revolution has run its course. Up to now the bloodshed has been very limited. When it is remembered that perhaps 80 millions of very poor people are in a state of complete anarchy, that arms and explosives are plentiful, it is a matter for some wonder that more terrible happenings have not yet been recorded.January 24, 1918.There are signs that a real conflict is nearing between the Bolsheviks and the balance of other parties, but nothing has yet occurred of importance ; the assassination of MM. Shingareff and Kokoshkin and a few street casualties are not true terrorism.January 31, 1918.Interest attaches to the first telegram given in the report regarding the &quot; Congress of Soviets.&quot; The reason given for the closing of the Constituent Assembly fits in with the Bolshevik doctrine that the proletariat alone have political rights. The Bolshevik aim is to replace Parliamentary institutions by a Congress of Soviets on a Syndicalist basis not only in Russia, but in all countries.February 7, 1918.The news from Russia requires to be followed with care. Special notice should be taken of General Arsenev&apos;s interview with Captain Smith. The news of disturbances at Vladikavkaz is somewhat disquieting, as it is a centre from which civil war might spread over the mountains into the Caucasus. The action of the Patriarch at Moscow may prove something of a landmark in the revolution. It is singular that the Bolsheviks had hitherto not taken active steps against the Church ; it must be remembered that the state of Ru-sia is, in the peasant classes, about on a par with that of Europe in the fourteenth century, and that though the leaders of the revolution are so advanced in political ideas as to look upon representative institutions as reactionary, yet the mass which follows is so far behind our age as to be susceptible to religious influences in a way we can hardly gauge. However, if the fourteenth century produced Lollards we ought not to be astonished if some similar communistic religious political movement did not appear in Russia and overthrow the existing forms of Orthodoxy.February 14, 1918.&apos;l he news from Russia is bulky, but not susceptible of general appreciation. The Esthonian question is important, as it appears to be one of those areas over which the Russian Bolsheviks might once again come into conflict with Germany.February 21, 1918.The outstanding event of the week which is not very clearly indicated in the report is the fact that at Kief there is a Bolshevik commander, named General Muravieff, whose orders are obeyed and who enforces discipline among his troops. This is the first indication of either leading or real authoritative action on tbe part of any person or organisation in Bussia since the abdication of the Emperor. Hitherto all successes have been those of disintegration ; it is just possible that the Bolsheviks feel that the disintegration is now complete, and that the moment for action has come. In fact, that an army may be now formed which would not menace the revolution.We have no further news of the action against religion ; if the Bolsheviks proceed to violence against the Church on a large scale it will indicate that they feel really firm in the saddle.[898-86] E
February 28, 1918.Russia is now being overrun by numerically small forces of the enemy. What he will do with the occupied territory is not very easy to see. With a depleted and some-what war-worn military machine, Germany is absorbing large masses of non-German people, and doubtless many thousands of revolutionary agents. It has been decided by the Germans that this is the best alternative to allowing Bolshevism to remain in a state of hostile pacificism along the old front. In neither case is the problem confronting the Germans easy or simple ; however, they continue to rely on the discipline of their army and the quiescence of their masses. It must be remembered, however, that, revolutionary agents will follow the line of least resistance, and that the3&apos; will proceed to foment discontent in the weaker and more susceptible quarters, namely, Poland, Galicia, &amp;c. In Russia itself the Red Guard will probably determine to fight Russian political opponents only.APPENDIX II.Report from Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton, P.O. at Kuwait, describing his Route from .  Kuwait to Zilfi, dated Zilfi, October 27, 1917.I LEFT Kuwait on the evening of the 9th October, after saying good-hye to Shaikh Salim at his palace at 4-30 p.m. Our first camp was at Sirrah wells, about two hours distant from Kuwait.2. My party consisted of the Agency Arabic writer, Khan Sahib Mulla &apos;Abdullah-ibn-&apos;Abdullah, the camel escort under &apos;Abdul &apos;Aziz-bin-Hassun with 5 Beduin rafiqs and 3 camel drivers. For additional security Shaikh Salim provided me with 6 rafiqs from bis own Beduin guard. I took with me a Portuguese lad of 16 years of age,, one of my boatmen, Ali, and a negro sent by the Shaikh of Muhammarah. We are a party therefore of 20 souls, and have with us 31 riding camels, 13 of which have been lent by bis Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait. The party is on the same scale as that which I arranged for Mr. Storrs in June last, and is, I consider, a model in size and composi-tion : in si&amp;e because it is strong enough to repel small gangs of marauders, and in composition because composed of rafiqs from the tribes of &apos;Ajman (two sections), Shammar (two sections), Dhafir Mutair (two sections), and &apos;Anizah.3. We were somewhat delayed by the Shaqrah caravan, which Shaikh Salim washed us to go along with as far as Al Safah, and we did not leave Subaihlyah, 34 miles from Kuwait, on the boundary of the Shaikh&apos;s territory, until the 13th October. The pace of the caravan was so slow that I decided to leave it, and we made for the walls of Al Qara&apos;ah, which we reached on the 17th October at about 9 15 a.m. This march from Subaihiyah should not take more than four days for a good moving party with baggage, and we were greatly delayed by trying to keep in touch with the Shaqrah caravan.4. At Al Qara&apos;ah, and camps between it and Al Safah wells, were about 300 Shammar tents under Idhar-ibn-Radhi, a young man of about 27 years of age who came in to see us while we were resting under canvas during the middle hours of the day before we reached the wells. &apos;Ajman and Shammar are now camping between Zubair, Jahrab, Kuwait, and up to the edge of the Qasim Dabanah, where the Mutair are concentrated. After halting practically two days at Al Qara&apos;ah to rest the camels we marched to Gayyiyah wells on the early morning of the 23rd October, the fifth day out from the last camping place. Here we were met by Watban-al-Dawish, his son Riddan, and cousin, Muhammad-ibn-Fahad-al-&apos;Askar. We were anxious to cut short our stay at Gayyiyah, hearing that Faisal-al-Dawish, head of all the Mutair, was at Artawiyah and had joined the Wahhabi brotherhood, called the Ikhwan. Artawiyah is a hotbed of Mahommedan bigotry just now and there is no love lost between these Puritans and any of the more frank and civilised folk who inhabit Kuwait and Basra. The place is full of metowwan or overseers, who punish offences of a religious nature such as slackness in attending prayers and even smoking tobacco by thrashing the delinquents.While talking to Watban, bis cousin Muhammad-ibn-Fahad-al-Askar repeatedly smote the ground, boasting of the importance of the Mutair. He said there were 35,000 people in Artawiyah &quot; Yes, by God ! and more &quot; while Watban remarked, &quot;And God grant that this (settlement) may advance the Faith,&quot; so we may take it that the Mutair are going in hot and strong for this revivalist movement.   As we left
-Gayyiyab, our party, one and all, including the Mutair rafiqs, the greatest smokers amongst us, cursed Artawiyah and all connected with the place.5. We reached Zilfi without further incident just before midday, the 25th October. Were well received by the Amir or Governor, &apos;Usman-al-Muhammad, with whom we dined. Next day visited both towns of Zilfi, the old and the new. They are separated by a distance of just under 2 miles. The inhabitants of Zilfi appeared to be friendly, but here as elsewhere in Najd, so I am told, there is a large and increasing number of Ikhwan (brotherhood). I sent a camel rider to Boraidah with one of the Amir of ZihTs sons taking a letter to Turki-ibn-Sa&apos;ud announcing my arrival .here and intended journeyto see him in Buraidah.Colonel Hamilton&apos;s account of Artawiyah * is confirmed by Shaikh Faisal-ibn-Farhan-al-Jarbah, of the Northern Shammar,.who passed through Artawiyah on his way from Biyadh to Kuwait, Shaikh Faisal, who was returning from a visit to the Sherif, arrived in Bagdad at the beginning of November. He states that Faisal-al-Dawish has built himself a large qasr at Artawiyah and that his example has been followed by several minor shaikhs. A numerous colony is established round the wells, the water of which is sufficiently plentiful to admit of cultivation being carried on. Faisal-al-Jarbah had no sympathy with the stringency of Wahhabi regulations touching the smoking of tobacco, but as a good Mohammedan he felt obliged to testify to the punctual attendance of prayers on the part of the community. It was clear, however, that he had not enjoyed his stay at Artawiyah, nor does he feel any love for the Mutair, who looted him west of Al Bass, on his way from Mecca to Riyadh.o* This paragraph was presumably added iu the office of the C.P.O., Bagdad, by whom Colonel Hamilton&apos;s report was sent to England.
