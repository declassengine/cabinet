Trotsky: I have the honour to inform you that the National Congress of Councils of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies established on the 26th October, old style, a new Government of the Russian Republic under the form of a Council of Commissioners of the Beople. The president of this Government is M. Lenin, and the direction of foreign policy was entrusted to me [M. Trotsky] as the People&apos;s Commissary for Foreign Affairs. I have the honour to draw your attention to the text of the Gazette for the armistice and democratic peace, without annexations or contributions, founded on the right of peoples to dispose of themselves a proposal approved by the assembled Councils of Workmen and Soldiers and to pray your Excellency to regard the above-mentioned document as a formal proposition of an immediate armistice on all fronts, and for the opening without delay of the peace negotiations proposal which the plenipotentiary of the Government of the Russian Republic is addressing simultaneously to all belligerent nations and their Governments.In regard to this on the 24th November Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 1863] that the following note had been addressed to the Norwegian, Dutch, Spanish, Swiss&apos;,. Danish, and Swedish Ministers by M. Trotsky in his official capacity as People&apos;s Commissioner for Foreign Affairs: &quot; On the 8th/21st November, according to the decision taken by the Congress of Soviets of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies I addressed, in the name of the Council of People&apos;s Commissioners, to allied embassies a proposal for the commencement of negotiations, an immediate armistice on all fronts, and a democratic peace, without annexation or contribution, based on the will of the people. Simultaneously the Council of People&apos;s Commissioners instructed the military authorities, delegates of the republican army, to commence the preliminary negotiations with the military authorities of the hostile armies for an immediate armistice on our own and on all fronts.&quot; Informing, you as above, i have the honour to beg you to take all steps to communicate  officially to  the  enemy Government our proposals for an immediate[898-71] B
armistice a,nd for the commencement of peace negotiations. At the same time I permit myself to express the hope that you will take all steps in your power to acquaint, with all necessary fullness, the public opinion  of the country by which you are accredited.....&quot; The labouring masses of neutral, countries are suffering the greatest misery, the result of this criminal slaughter which, unless it is ended, threatens also to engulf the peoples still remaining outside the war.....The  Government therefore rely onfinding the fullest support in the labouring masses&apos; of neutral countries in the struggle for peace, and beg you accept the assurance of the readiness of the Russian democracy to strengthen and develop the friendliest relations with the democracy of all countries.&quot;Instructions for the commander-in-Ghief.-On the 22nd November he transmitted [No. 1848] the text of the instructions telegraphed to the Russian Commander-in-Ohief: The Council of People&apos;s Commissioners, &apos;under instructions from All-Russian Congress of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies, has assumed authority and at the same time undertaken to propose to all belligerent peoples and their Governments an immediate armistice on all fronts and the immediate opening of negotiations with a view to the conclusion of peace on democratic principles. Now, when the authority of the Soviet has been secured at all the most important points of the country, the Council of People&apos;s Commissioners considers it necessary at once to make a formal proposal for an armistice to all belligerents, both to allies and to those in hostile relations with us. A similar statement has been sent by the People&apos;s Commissioner for Foreign Affairs to all official representatives of the allied countries in Petrograd. You, citizen Commander-in-Chief, are instructed by the Council of the People&apos;s Commissioners, in execution of the decision taken by the All-Russian&apos; Congress of Soviets of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Deputies immediately on receipt of the present instructions, to address yourself to the military authorities of the enemy armies with a proposal for the immediate cessation of military operations, with a view to the opening of peace negotiations. Entrusting you to conduct these preliminary negotiations, the Council of the People&apos;s Commissioners orders you, first, to keep the Soviet constantly informed by telegraph of the course of your negotiations with representatives of enemy armies; and, secondly, to sign an armistice only after it has been approved by the Council of the People&apos;s Commissioners. (Signed)   Lenin, Trotsky, Krilenko.Soviet Proclamation to the Army. On the 25th November he telegraphed [No. 1868] that the official Soviet paper had published a proclamation to all regiments, divisions, corps, and army committees signed by M. Trotsky, dated 6 A.M., 24th November. He alluded to the written protest made by the allied military repre-sentatives at general headquarters against the conclusion of a separate armistice when their Governments had made no reply to the proposal put forward by the present Russian Government for a general armistice on all fronts. He characterised the note as an attempt by the allied representatives to force by threats the Russian army and people to continue the war in accordance with treaties made by the old regime, which had been condemned by the present G-overnment as no longer binding. He said : &quot; Soldiers, workmen, peasants ! Your Soviet will not permit the foreign bourgeoisie, to whip you back to the slaughterhouse. Let them all learn that the soldiers, workmen, and peasants of Russia did not overthrow the Emperor and the Government of Kerensky in order to remain cannon fodder for ally imperialists.&quot; Sir G. Buchanan adds that as soon as he heard of this lie sent the military attache to protest, through the ministry of war, against the proclamation as likely, in the excited state of the public mind, to endanger the lives of allied representatives at the front.Statement of Situation made by M. Trotsky. On the 22nd November he telegraphed [No. 1850 J the following summary of a statement respecting BusskVs foreign relations made by M. Trotsky in his capacity of people&apos;s commissioner for foreign affairs at a sitting of the central executive committee of the Congress of Workmen and Soldiers&apos; Deputies held on the 21st November. M. Trotsky began by stating that the foreign policy of the new Government had passed a decree respecting peace, as approved by the All-Russian Congress of Sovyets. The bourgeoisie of the allied countries, he declared bitterly, in common with all Europe, had at first been hostile to the decree, and had failed to recognise the decree, not as a mere party statement, but as a formal proposal by a Government representing millions. Theinternal political situation created by the events of 8th November had hitherto prevented the
new administration from making formal peace proposals in the recognised procedure through the accredited foreign representatives in Russia. But it must now be patent to all that the new authority is a real one and must be accepted.As to the attitude of the Allies towards peace and the new Government, he stated that the British Government was probably most hostilely disposed, since England stood to lose the least and win the most from the war. France had suffered most, and was pacifically inclined, but her sympathy towards the Government was tempered by mistrust of its relations with Germany. The feeling against the war was daily growing amongst the French proletariat; Italy had welcomed the change in Russia with enthusiasm. The attitude of America would probably be the most tolerant of all the Allies, since the exhausted condition of Europe must be to her advantage, and the American capitalists who drove her into war were desirous to invest their millions in Russia. As regarded Germany her internal, economic condition was compelling her to adopt a semi-acquiescent attitude towards Russia, and German peace proposals were mainly dictated by a desire to transfer to her opponents the responsibility of the prolongation of the war.The actual reception of Russians peace decree among the proletariat of all Europe, including Germany, had exceeded the most optimistic expectations; they understood that the change of authority was effected not merely as a seizure of power by a band of conspirators supported by workmen, guards, and sailors, as alleged by our opponents, but was the commencement of a universal movement which would open a new epoch in the history of the world. M. Trotsky declared that the war had received its death-blow, and that European Governments had already abandoned all idea of the realisation of the original aims for which war was undertaken, and were now engaged in endeavouring to liquidate the venture with the least loss to themselves.Referring to the previous declaration of his intention to publish all secret inter-national agreements, M. Trotsky stated he had now obtained possession of all official documents, which he described as masterpieces of cynicism, and stated he would publish them in the immediate future. He added that they consisted not of formal treaties, but of diplomatic correspondence and cypher telegrams exchanged between Governments,Publication of Secret Documents. On the 23rd November Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed again [No. 1857] saying that the first instalment of the secret correspondence which M. Trotsky had found at Ministry for Foreign Affairs had been published in the press.The correspondence, of which translations were being forwarded, comprised the following: Telegrams addressed to Russian representatives abroad in 191,), regarding the agreements respecting Constantinople and the Straits, and mentioning our special interests in Persia and Asia Minor. Telegram addressed to the Russian representatives in Paris in March 1916 defining the Russian attitude at forthcoming conference. Principal points are the free action of France and Great Britain in regard to the western frontiers of Germany in return for the equality provided for Russia in regard to the eastern (group undecypherable) and purely Russian character of the Polish question.   Telegrams to and from Paris in February 1917 agreeing to the proposals ofM. Doumergue regarding left bank of the Rhine.   Telegrams from Ter.....on theinternal situation in Bussia and on the collective representations made by the three Ambassadors on the 9r.fi October. In one of these he expresses his (? thanks) to Mr. Lansing for the non-participation of the United States Ambassador. Telegram from the Russian Charge d&apos;Affaires at Berne, dated the 9th October last, reporting a meeting of German and French financiers who are supposed to have discussed terms of peace at the expense of Russia. The telegram adds that the English denied having taken part, but that Mr. Bell, of Lloyd&apos;s Bank, had arrived in Geneva on the 15th September.There appeared to be nothing in the correspondence which discredited the Allied Governments.An Opinion on the Situation. Telegraphing again on the 25th November, Sir G. Buchanan transmitted [No. 1864] a message from the military attache saying that a prominent personage with whom he had spoken attributed the late fiasco entirely to M. Kerensky, by whose vacillation all the reliable elements of the population had been alienated ; as an example of this he mentioned that M. Kerensky had dashed, in his car, between the Cossacks and the Bolsheviks,, whom the former were nbout to attack and would certainly have driven out of Tsarkoe-Selo, and as usual made a speech with the [898-71] B 2
result that the two parties fraternised. The military attaches informant thought that there would be a straight fight between the Bolshevik and bourgeois parties : he believed in the Don party, and hoped that Korniloff might be induced to escape (he had so far refused), as he was a better leader of men than Kalediu. Cutting off supplies was all that the Don party could do, and this would mean the starvation of the army on the Western front.Situation in Archangel. -The consul at Archangel telegraphed on the 22nd November [No. 48] that the situation in that place continued to be almost normal and the leaderg of all parties were so far on the side of order. Local conditions were favourable to the maintenance of this satisfactory situation, but the question of food and clothing would undoubtedly be the most important if not the decisive factor,, and the outlook in this regard was hardly so satisfactory.The Germans in Courland. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed on the 26th November [No. 1147 j that the Germans, in order to create a feeling in favour of Germany, were conducting a systematic propaganda in Courland and spending enormous sums of money. They seemed to be preparing the way for a plebiscite with a view to the establishment of an &quot;independent&quot; Courland. This information had been acquired from a direct and absolutely sure source by one of his colleagues.POLAND.The Activist Parties. Sir E. Howard telegraphed on the 24th November [No. 3294] that the &quot; Affconbladet &quot; of that day had stated that the Warsaw Press had announced that a deputation of the Polish Activist parties, with two representatives of each party, would start shortly for Berlin and Vienna in order to enter into closer relations with the German and Austro-Hungarian parliamentarians at their conference. The deputation would also be instructed to give information regarding the Polish internal situation. The names of the members of the deputation included Zorewski Ronickier, of the Central National party, of which Prince Alexander Lubecki was head.TURKEY.Conference a.t Berne. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Lord Bertie on the 26th November [No. 2830] instructing him to inform the French Government that the objects which His Majesty&apos;s Government desired, to obtain at the conference with the Turkish delegates at Berne were : (a) An improvement in the treatment of British prisoners of war in Turkey ; (b) An exchange of invalid combatant prisoners of war; (c) The exchange of civilians including French civilians if, as we understand, the French Government have no objection. He added that the results of the conference would be communicated to the French Government without delay.German Support of Pan-Turanianism. An agent calls attention to the fact that the German Government has for some time past in Turkey been encouraging the formation of Turanian clubs, formed expressly to inculcate the belief that every effort must be made by Moslems to constitute, a Moslem empire stretching from the Mediter-ranean to China. This was being taught in schools and universities, and the most suitable converts were sent to Russian Moslem countries for propaganda work. The movement was apparently spreading. Germany was said to be spending millions on this work, and Turks and Russian Moslems were&apos; being taught to believe that a hom;)geneous Moslem empire would eventually lead to Afghanistan and India through Central Asia-of course under the protection of Germany.PALESTINE.The German Zionist Press. - Reuter&apos;s agent telegraphed from Amsterdam on the 26th NovemU-T that the Jiidische Rundschau, the organ of the Zionist Association in Germany, discussing the British Governments declaration regarding the creation of a home in Palestine fur the Jewish people, says: -&quot; It is a mistake to regard to regard the British assurance as bluff, for if Great Britain succeeded in occupying Palestine she would be immediately obliged to fulfil the promises given in the declaration. -Moreover, it is impossible to doubt that Great Britaiifs allies have agreed to meet Zionist wishes. A final solution, however, will only be possible at the peace congress.&quot; 1 .
The journal appears to regard it as necessary to get the assent of Turkey and the I Central Powers for the realisation of such a Zionist scheme.The Kolnische Volks-Zeitung, commenting on this statement, says : &quot;The Central Powers regard these desires with good-will on the understand-ing, of course, that Palestine remains a component part of a strong and secure Turkish Empire, and offers all religions the same freedom.&quot;[&quot;The Times,&quot; 27th November, 1917.]   .Persecution of the Jews. Statements made by prisoners taken on the Palestine i front suggest that there has been a good deal of persecution of the Jews on the part of the Turks.PERSIA.A New Cabinet. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 24th November [No. 401] that a new Cabinet had been formed by Ain-ed-Dowleh with Mukhbares-Sultaneh as Minister of Justice, Mushar-ul-Mulk as Minister of Finance, Amin-al-Mulk as Minister of Posts, and Vossuk-ed-Dowleh as Minister of Education ; the other office-holders being as before. The Shah exercised the strongest pressure on Vossuk-ed-Dowleh to induce him to accept office ; and it is generally expected that he will be asked to form a Cabinet in the immediate future, the present extraordinary combination, which implies no change of policy, being due mainly to the Shab&apos;s dislike to abrupt transit. The inclusion of the new Minister of Justice is none the less an offence that it will probably be explained as a set-off to the Minister of Education.Shortage of Com. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on tins 23rd November [No. 399] that the consul at Shiraz had informed him that grain only existed in small quantities and had to be brought from great distances. Hence the high prices. As far as possible prices had been regulated, and more drastic action would lead to trouble. Flour from India was anxiously awaited, but the 1,000 tons promised had not yet been despatched.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.RUSSIA.Negotiations for an Armistice. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 28th November [No. 1887 I that an official announcement had been that day published by the Minister of War and the supreme commander-in-chief of the present administration, Krillenko, stating that under his instructions on the afternoon of the 26th November a truce party entered the German trenches, opposite that portion of the line held by 5th Army, with a proposal to open negotiations for an immediate armistice on all fronts of all belligerents, with a view to the commencement of peace negotiations. A favourable reply was received by the evening of the following day from the German commander-in-chief of the northern front, acting under instructions from German Government ; negotiations are to begin on the 1st December, new style. The communique further stated that this date had been fixed to allow time for the issue of a second invitation to the Allies to accept the Russian peace platform and to act conjointly with the Russians for the conclusion of an armistice.Russians Interned in England. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 26th November [No. 1874J that he had received a note from M. Trotsky stating that among the foreigners interned in England were two Russians, named Chichirin and Impliroff, who were well known in Russia as &quot;stainless, self-sncrificing men of high ideals who were quite above suspicion.&quot; They had, the note stated, provoked the British authorities by upholding the principles of international socialism, as had been done by Maclean in Scotland and by Liebknecbt in Germany. If the British authorities considered such activities to be inadmissible in Great Britain, the Government of the republic must ask for the release of these persons and of others similarly placed in order&quot; -that they might return. The note drew his attention to the fact that in Russia there were many English who made no attempt to conceal their counter-revolutionary attitude
and their openly engaging in political activities with counter-revolutionary elements of the bourgeois classes. Public opinion in revolutionary democratic Russia could not accept the position that heroes of the revolution should languish in concentration camps in England whilst British counter-revolutionaries suftered no hardships in Russia. The note concluded by expressing the conviction that this urgent request would meet with the fullest sympathy from the freedom-loving proletariat of Great Britain.In regard to the demand for the release of the two men mentioned above, Mr. Babour instructed Sir G. Buchanan TNo. 2374] to make no reply.The Ukraine.The Ukraine Republic. -The consul at Odessa telegraphed on the 14th November [No. 143] that he had had an interview with the president of the district Bada, who had told him that the Ukraine wanted to return to its position of two and a-half centuries ago by becoming an autonomous State. They wanted to form part of the federal States of Bussia; but they did not want to be dictated to by the Russian Assembly, and therefore, in order to settle the main policy and form a Government, they wished to convene the Ukraine Constituent Assembly before the Russian Assembly met. They desired a common currency, common railways, and a common external policy exclusive of the question of peace and war.On the following&quot; day he telegraphed again [No. 144] sajdng that on the previous evening the local Rada had announced that full power over the ethnographic territory of Ukraine had been assumed by the central Rada at Kieff, and on the 21st November he telegraphed again [No. 150] that he had been informed by the Chief of the Staff that, whilst not separating from the Russian Republic, the Ukraine had declared a &quot; National B,epublic&quot; of its own.PALESTINE.Zionism.Attitude of the Salonica Jews. Mr. Wratislaw telegraphed from Salonica on the 23rd November [No. 164] that the committee of the Jewish Congress of Salonica had requested that a message, of which the following is a translation, might be communicated to the Prime Minister : The committee of the Salonica Jewish Congress received with unspeakable joy the news of the declaration made by the British Government regarding the constitution of the Jewish nation in Palestine, and is greatly moved at the sight of so striking a confirmation of the national aspirations of the Jewish people as that which has been now given by the great and liberal English nation. The Israelites of Salonica, in common with the whole of Jewry, express their deep gratitude to the British Government, with warm hopes for the final triumph of right, of justice, and of that principle of nationality which has been so powerfully defended by England her allies.Scandinavian Zionist Association. Sir Esme Howard telegraphed on the 27th November [No. 3307] that the press had reported that, in connection with the announcement of the British Government regarding Jewish settlement in Palestine, the Scandinavian Zionist Association had held a crowded meeting in Stockholm on the 25th November, at which an expression of lively satisfaction at the announcement had been enthusiastically applauded. A resolution was passed unanimously welcoming the action of the British Government and binding ali present to use every effort to secure a national future for the Jewish people.PaafTKD AT THE KOEKIGN OFFICE BT c.

Russia is the only country inhabited by Turks where there has been an official census, and even in Eussia the last (and first) census was in 1S97. The figures here given for Eussia consist of. estimates made in 1911 on the basis of the census of 1S97.   The rest of the figures are more conjectural still.f Not including about 100,000 semi-Tatarised aliens (mostly Ugro-Finnish).ADDEND TIM. In 1909 the Moslem Ecclesiastical Court of Orenburg, an official body which, under the Old Regime, exercised authority over the Moslems of the Russian Empire, excluding the Caucasus, Crimea and Central Asiatic provinces, and which, among other duties, kept a record of births and deaths, estimated the number of Moslems under its jurisdiction at 5,283,618. This is more than a million in excess of the figures given above for the Kazan, Astrakhan, and West Siberian Tatars, Chuvashes and Bashkirs combined. The difference is probably accounted for by the inclusion of certain sections of the Kirghiz, whose territory is reckoned administratively as part of European Russia.
THE  PAN-TURANIAN  MOVEMENT.1. Origin of the name &quot;Pan-Turanian.&quot;Turan is a Persian word. In Persian medieval poetry Si means the steppes and deserts of Central Asia, in contrast to the. settled country of Iran or Persia. The &quot; people of Turan &quot; are the nomads (of many different languages ancl races) who constantly overran Persia from the north-east, till the Russians pacified Central Asia half a century ago.Nineteenth-century philologists in Europe appropriated the . name Turanian for the languages of north-eastern Europe and Asia which are &quot; agglutinative&quot; in structure, in contrast to the Indo-European family. It was really a negative term a pro-visional label for an unexplored mass. &quot; Turanian &quot; research was first taken up seriously by the Magyars, who speak one of these agglutinative languages (of the TJgro-Einnic group) and have always felt themselves isolated among the Latin, Slavonic, and Teutonic speaking peoples of Europe. A medieval Plungarian monk once made a pilgrimage eastward to discover his lost kinsmen, and lighted upon the Bashkirs of the Ural Region; and during the present war Magyar professors are said to bave conducted a propaganda among Russian prisoners of war belonging to easterly Einnish tribes, to prove to them that the Magyars are their brethren and Buda-Best their cultural home.Magyar Ban-Turanianism has followed in the wake of Russian Pan-Slavism. When the Prussians remembered their kinship with the Balkan Slavs, and this movement took on a political form, the Magyars looked about for &quot; Turanian&quot; anti-Slav allies, and naturally thought of the Turks. The famous Hungarian savant, Vambery, was led by this Turanian idea to research among the Turkish-speaking peoples of Central Asia, but the Magyars addressed themselves chiefly to the Osmanlis. When the Magyar struggle for independence in 1848 was crushed by the combined Austro-Russian armies, many leading Magyar refugees had found an asylum at Constantinople. In 1867 these exiles returned to Hungary and became a power in the newly-constituted Bual Monarchy. During the Balkan upheavals of 1875-8 the Magyars were violently pro-Ottoman, and a deputation of Magyar students presented a sword of honour to the Sultan during the Serbo-Turkish War.This Magyar-Ottoman rapprochement was not really racial but political. It rested not on a common consciousness of &quot; Turanianism&quot; but on a common hostility to certain Slavonic States. The same political motives have led people in Bulgaria to accept the Turanian label since the Bulgarian Governments intervention against Serbia and Russia in the European War. Yet the Bulgars are as much Slavs as any other Slavonic-speaking people. The original founders of the Bulgarian State, thirteen centuries ago, Avere certainly &quot; Turanian&quot; nomads from the steppes, but they have left less trace on the Slavs upon whom they imposed themselves in the Balkan Peninsula than the Normans have oil the people of England. Modern Bulgaria is a Slavonic State which has played for its own hand in defiance of Pan-Slav sentiment, ancl wishes for new sentimental catchwords that conform with its Real-Politik.Thus Pan-Turanianism, in its origin, is (a) artificial, and ip) European. The Osmanlis did not extract it for themselves from Persian literature (though they study Persian as we study the Greek and Latin classics); it was offered to them from Europe, and they have not been the wooers but the wooed. The Osmanli has no genuine sentiment for the Bulgar or the Magyar, who are both ex-subjects of his, like the Serb and the Greek.   If supposeda 2
self-interest induces the Bulgar and Magyar to fight his battles, subscribe to his loans, give his young men technical instruction, and supply him with machinery, he will take fall advantage of their services. But he feels no more kinship with them than with the other Christian nations of Europe&apos;;* and his principal object iw this war is to rid the Ottoman Empire of external European influences, whether these are &quot; Central &quot; or &quot;Entente,&quot; &quot; Turanian &quot; or &quot; Teutonic.&apos;-&apos;2. Pan-Turanianism as Pan-Turkism.A trained philologist may be conscious of some unity of structure in all Turanian languages as contrasted with the Indo-European family, but to the uninitiated Osmanli there is no visible relation between his own language, which belongs to the Turkish group, and Magyar, which is TJgro-Einnic. On the other hand, the relation of the various Turkish dialects to one another is obvious to anyone. It can he seen on the map in the names of rivers, mountains, and towns. The Turkish-speaking peoples stretch from Turkey-in-Europe through Anatolia, Trans-Caucasia, Northern Persia and Afghanistan, to Russian Central Asia and Chinese Turkestan, and, in a more broken chain, round the northern shores of the Black - Sea, through Bulgaria, Dohrudja, Crimea, the volga provinces and Siberia, to the neighbourhood of the Arctic Ocean.f They cover an even more extensive though less compact area than the Slavs, and the different Turkish dialects are as readily intelligible to all Turks as the different Slavonic languages are to any speaker of one of them. It was therefore only natural that as soon as the Ottoman Turks became linguisti-cally conscious of their nationality, they should become conscious at the same time of their affinities with other Turkish-speaking peoples, just as the national revival of the separate Slavonic populations produced a common sense of Pan-Slavism among them.Pan-Turanianism, then, in the sense of a Pan-Turkish move-merit originating among the Ottoman Turks, is part and parcel of Ottoman Turkish nationalism, and can only be understood in relation to it.3. Turkish Nationality in the Ottoman Empire.The consciousness of nationality, like the word &quot; Pan-Turanian,&quot; has come to the Osmanlis from Europe. The Ottoman Empire began as the very opposite of a national state. It is not called after any people .who inhabit it, but after the prince who founded it Osman. It is true that Osman and his tribe were Turks, hut they were only one out of a dozen Turkish states in Anatolia, and their Turkish neighbours were their worst rivals and enemies. They built up their power by conquests in Europe. Their best taxpayers were Christian subjects, their standing-army Christian converts, their most loyal supporters apostate Albanians and Slavs, who changed their religion but kept their language. Till a century ago the Turkish nationality contributed practically nothing to the Ottoman State except the literary and official language of the governing classes, and that was so diluted with Persian and Arabic that it had little left in common with the vulgar Turkish of the Anatolian peasantry. The hulk of Anatolia was a comparatively late acquisition of the Empire. It was a neglected region, to a large extent practically independent, under local feudal chiefs.* This is true even of the Turkish doctrinaire Pan-Turanians, as may be seen from the following quotation from &quot; Tekin Alp &quot; : &quot; It is a matter of &quot; congratulation that the rapprochement between Magyars and Turks is &quot; being so well received here. . . . Yet the Turk&apos;s national idea cannot &quot; be the race theory, because the latter is really nothing but a Utopian &quot; dream.&quot;t See Map facing page 24.
During the last century, however, Anatolia has taken the place of the Balkan Peninsula as the &quot;home country&quot; of the Ottoman Empire; for while the Balkan provinces have been breaking away, the Asiatic provinces have been brought more and more under central control. The same Sultan who lost Greece broke the power of the feudal aristocracy in Anatolia and Kurd-istan. The process of disintegration in Europe reached its climax in the Balkan War of 1912-3; the process of centralisation-tion in Asia Minor has been completed by the Oil.P. since the treaty of Bukarest, and especially since Turkey&apos;s entry into the European War.The most significant change has been in the composition of the Ottoman Army. The Janissaries, a hereditary professional army descended from forced Christian converts of all races, were destroyed in 1826. The modern Turkish Army is organised on the 19th century European basis of conscription from the civil popu-lation. Down to 1908 the conscripts were nominally drawn from the whole Moslem population of the Empire, and since the Revolution Christians and Jews have been made liable as well. But the Government never got hold of the nomads and moun-taineers; the settled Arab population Avas not good military material nor easily mobilised on the most threatened frontiers, which till the present Avar Avere those in Europe. Both before and after 1908 the Moslem Turkish-speaking Anatolian peasantry have been the staple of the Ottoman conscript army its most amenable recruits and its toughest soldiers and the Anatolian upper classes haA^e more and more supplied the Centralised Empire Avith its officers and officials. Thus, when the conscious Turkish national moArement began, the Ottoman State was already resting on a practical foundation of Turkish nationality.4. The Beginnings ol Turkish Nationalism.The cxiltivation of national consciousness by the Ottoman Turks Avas partly an imitation of older nationalist movements in Europe and partly the spontaneous product of similar conditions. Like most European nationalisms (Czech nationalism for instance) it started by being cultural rather than political. The first nationalist society was founded at Salonika in 1909, in the com-paratively free atmosphere that prevailed during the first three years after the Young Turk Evolution. The founder of this society Avas a -provincial notable one Ziya Bey, of Diarbekir, avIio had come up to attend a C.UYP. Congress. Diarbekir is a Turkish enclaA^e in Kurdish and Armenian territory, and it is characteristic of nationalist movements that their most fanatical leaders come from the debateable borderlands.Ziya Bey&apos;s group started a campaign to purge the literary Ottoman language of its Arabic and Persian borrowings, and replace these by old Turkish Avords which had never been admitted into Ottoman literature. This might seem a fantastic aim, for it is only through the adoption of foreign words, idioms and rhythms that Turkish has been given literary form at all. Yet submerged languages in Europe have been revived under circumstances of almost equal difficulty, and this &quot; Pure Turkish &quot; movement claims to have had complete success. The Turkish writers of the traditional school were routed, and the use of Arabic was even attacked in the ecclesiastical field. The Nationalists AAdshed to translate the Koran, friday Sermon, and Khutba (Prayer for the Caliph) into Turkish, and to remove the Arabic texts from the walls of Turkish Mosques ; but they had to drop this part of their programme, AAdiich was far in adArance of ordinary Turkish opinion.&quot;5&quot;* See Appendix 2.
This phase of Turkish Nationalism lasted from 1909 to the Balkan &quot;War of 1912-3. It was a doctrinaire imitation of the linguistic Nationalism of Europe, impossibilist and unpolitical. Our chief information about it conies from a book on &quot; The Turkish and Pan-Turkish Ideal&quot; by Tekin Alp,* a pseudonym which is believed to cover the name of Albert Cohen, a Salonika Jew.t This illustrates (a) the artificial origins of the movement and (6) its prospects of success. The Salonika Jews are inseparable from the C.U.P., and one of their number would hardly have taken up Pan-Turanianism so strongly unless he thought it had found favour in the eyes of the O.TJ.P. leaders. Cohen evidently feels it politic to identify himself with the Nationalism of the ruling race in Turkey, as the Jews in Hungary have identified themselves with Magyarisation. But his book has to be used with caution; for though it has been written since the OH.P. have taken up the Pan-Turanian idea, it is impossible to tell how much (if any) of its contents represent the C.U.P. policy. On the whole it is safer to take &quot; Tekin Alp &quot; as representing the doctrinaire school of Ziya Bey, and to judge the Pan-Turanianism. of the C.U.P. solely on the evidence of their political actions since the Balkan War.5. The Effects of the Balkan War.The Balkan War made Pan-Turanianism practical politics. The shock of this disaster penetrated to wider circles than had been affected by the academic movement of the previous years, and seems to have kindled a genuine desire for national regeneration among all educated Turks. A number of societies, with local branches in Anatolia, the Caucasus and Turkestan, were founded to promote education, physical culture, emancipation of women, and other really constructive aims, and from this time onwards the Government lent its support. The Ministry of Aukaf or Religious Endowments has made grants out of its enormous funds for the multiplication of national schools; there has been a scheme for reforming the Meclressos the reactionary Moslem ecclesiastical seminaries; and during the present war the Government has challenged the whole existing ecclesiastical order by sweeping legal reforms which will bring much of. the former domain of the Sheriat (Sacred Law) under the civil jtxrisdiction. The Sheikh-ul-Islam resigned over this, but he was and remained an active &quot; Unionist&quot; and the fait accompli was accepted by his successor. It is possible that both were acting in collusion with the Govern-ment calculating that this formal protest would be a safety-valve for discontent among the humbler members of the ecclesiastical body all these activities were inspirations from Europe, like the crusade for a pure Turkish language, but they were of a much sounder kind. The Osmanlis seem to have been impressed by the example of the Balkan States, which had built up their-strength by internal reforms till they were able to beat Turkey in war. Unfortunately they also borrowed from them another idea  irredentism.&quot; Observers,&quot; Tekin Alp writes, &quot; who like myself are Mace-&quot; donians and like myself had ample opportunity of gaining an &quot; intimate knowledge   of   the  irredentist  propaganda   of  the* Published in German by Kiepenheuer, Weimar, 1915, translated into English by Dr. E. Denison Ross, and circulated officially by the Intelligence Division of the Admiralty War Staff, March 1917.t By residence only and not by race, to judge by his fore-name. His residence in Macedonia is proved by allusions in the book itself, where he actually calls himself a Macedonian.X See &quot; Zwei Kriegsjahre in Konstantinopel,&quot; by Harry Stuermer, ex-correspondent of the &quot; Kolnische Zeitung &quot; (Payot et Cie., Lausanne). The incident is referred to in Chapter VOX
6. The Policy of the C.U.P.Irredentism gave a new significance to the linguistic reforms of the Ziya Bey Group, for the Ottoman literary language, relieved of its special Arabic and Persian borrowings and rein-forced by an eclectic pure-Turkish vocabulary, might become a lingua franca for all who spoke the. various living Turkish dialects. The Pan-Turanian movement was thus advancing on to purely political ground, and at that point itwras taken up by the C.U.P.The C.TJ.P. &quot;were not Nationalists to begin with, chiefly because they ignored the nationality problems of the Ottoman Empire. Their primary aim was to maintain the integrity of the Empire, especially in Europe, and in this they agreed with Abd-ul-Hamid and all previous rulers of Turkey. They only differed as to the means, for while Abd-ul-lTamid believed in despotism at home and a balance of jealousy among the European Powers, the C.TJ.P. held that Turkey&apos;s best safeguard wras internal strength, and the best source of strength political liberty. Their ideas of liberty were drawn from the Trench Bjevolution. &quot; Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity&quot; would be proclaimed, all inhabitants of the Empire would rally to the State as free Ottoman citizens just as Picards and Marseillais and Alsatians rallied to the Trench Republic after 1789 and the question of Nationality would solve itself.This actually happened for the first six weeks after the proclamation-mation of the Constitution in 1908. Men of all creeds and races embraced each other in the streets. But then they drew apart again and considered how they might turn the new regime to their own advantage. The Balkan nationalities rejected the offer of a liberal Turkey altogether, and determined to take the first oppor-tunity of completing their own unity and independence at Turkey&apos;s expense. Others4 like the Arabs, the Armenians, and the Con-stantinopolitan and Anatolian Greeks, recognised that secession was impossible, but took measures to defend their own national individuality within the Ottoman State. The Arabs formed the main opposition in the new parliament; the Armenians also wished for decentralisation, though they co-operated in Parliament wdth the C.U.P. The C.TJ.P. found that the Turks were the only element in the Empire that was not opposed to centralisation and had no political ideal incompatible with the Ottoman State idea. They therefore fell back upon their Turkish nationality, and came to think of Turkification as the natural means of achieving their ends. After the Balkan War they incorporated Turkification in then programme, hut it is important to examine precisely what place they gave it.&quot; Bulgars, Greeks, Serbs and Vlachs, are able to judge the signifi-&quot; cance of this national ideal, and how sweet and inspiring it is to &quot;go through the greatest dangers for such a cause&quot; and he proceeds to sketch the life history of several young Macedonian Christians who, before the Balkan War, had sacrificed everything to work for their national unification. This may, of course, simply represent &quot; Tekin Alp&apos;s &quot; personal philosophy, but it is probably true that the Balkan War did influence such public opinion as exists in Turkey in this direction. During the century ending in the years 1912-3 the centre of gravity of Turkey had actually shifted from Europe to Anatolia. After 1913 there was a corre-sponding change in the national consciousness. The Turkish nation abandoned the tradition of being a dominant race in Europe, resolved to develop its own latent possibilities in Anatolia, and conceived the ambition of making up for lost alien subjects by attracting to itself the scattered branches of the Turkish race outside the Ottoman frontiers.
7. Turkish Aims in the European War.It has been shown above that the Turkish version of Pan-Turanianism contains two general ideas : (a) To purify and strengthen the Turkish Nationality within the Ottoman Empire, and (b) to link up the Ottoman Turks with the other Turks in the world. These objects were first pursued in the cultural sphere by a private group of &quot; Intellectuals,&quot; ancl promoted by peaceful propaganda. After 1913 they took on a political form and were incorporated in the programme of the O.U.P. But while for. Ziya Bey&apos;s followers Tan-Turanianism was an end in itself, for the C.U.JP. it is. only, an instrument.. They will not give up movements that conflict with it, like Pan-Islamism, if these movements can still serve their turn, ancl they will not persist in it indefinitely in circumstances where it does not pay, as it is not paying at present in Syria, Mesopotamia ancl Arabia.The contrast between academic Pan-Turanianism and the Pan-Turanianism of the C.U.P.* can be summed up as follows&apos;:  (a) The first aim of the Ziya Bey Group was to purge the Turkish language ancl culture from foreign (i.e., chiefly Arabic) influences. , They Avere ready to violate some of the strongest prejudices of Islam for the sake of carrying this aim to its logical conclusion.The first aim of the C.U.B. is to purge the Turkish State from foreign (i.e., chiefly European) influences: extra-territoriality of foreign subjects, foreign control of Ottoman finance, railways, raw materials, and education. The doctrinaires dared to defy Islam.; the C.U.B. are far too prudent to do so, but they have defied Europe. When the Concert of Europe broke clown, they intervened in the Avar and denounced the Capitulations. Ancl in 1916 they passed a &quot; language ordinance&quot; making the use of Turkish compulsory, after a year&apos;s delay, for banks, newspapers, trams, railways, steamship companies, book-keeping of private firms, ancl all business of a remotely public or legal character.! (5) The doctrinaires proposed to strengthen the Turkish nationality in Anatolia by education and social reform. The C.U.P.&apos;s method has been to exterminate the non-Turkish nationalities scattered through the country  first the Armenians ancl latterly the Greeks -and to give their lands and houses to &quot; Muhajirs &quot; (Moslem refugees from the provinces lost in 1912-13, partly Turks, but partly Slavs from the Balkan peninsula and Greek-speaking Moslems from Krete). Another motive for the atrocities has been to make the Avar popular among the Turkish population by sating it Avith Armenian plunder a purely temporary and opportunist aim ancl they were also an appeal to that reactionary spirit of Moslem fanaticism against which the cloctrinaries have declared war. (c) &quot; Tekin Alp &quot; seeks to change the political ideal of the Ottoman Turk from Imperialism to Irreclentism from ruling over alien Christian nationalities in Europe to &quot; liberating&quot; kindred Turkish populations in Bussia ancl Central Asia. &apos;* Of course some C.U.P. leaders have taken up Pan-Turanianism in its academic form. Dr. Nazim, for instance, is said to have been converted by a book he borrowed from the French Consul-G-eneral at Salonika &quot; Introduction a 1&apos;Histoire de 1&apos;Asie : Turos et Mongols a 1405,&quot; by M. Leon Cahun, a French savant, whose thesis it is that the &quot; Turanians&quot; were a brilliant race ruined by the adoption of Islamic culture. But Dr. Nazim was always a doctrinaire, and since the Balkan War he has not been one of the dominating personalities in the CUD.t The stringency of the original draft was afterwards somewhat relaxed in the passage of the Bill through the Senate.
Por the C.U.P. it is rather a quantitative problem. In the Balkan War they lost territory, population and military prestige on their European frontiers. In the European War they hope to compensate or even out-balance these losses by corresponding gains in Asia and Africa; and here we have a fourth motive for the Armenian massacres, for the Armenians were an alien block separating the Ottoman Turks of Anatolia from the Tatars of Northern Persia and Russian Trans-Caucasia.8. Pan-Turanianism and Pan-Ialamism.The opportunism of the C.U.P. appears most clearly in their attempt to drive Pan-Turanianism and Pan-Islamism in double harness, though the two creeds are diametrically opposed to one another. The C.U.P. are devotees to neither, but exploit them both.Pan-Islamism is not really a religious doctrine. If it were, it would not be so incompatible with Pan-Turanianism as it is. Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turanianism are rival political programmes for increasing the power of the Ottoman Empire abroad.Most of the religious revivalism in Islam during the 19th century has been definitely anti-Ottoman. The Wahabis of Nejd and the Mahdists of the Egyptian Sudan both regarded the Turks as little better than Pranks and Infidels; the Senussi retired to the Libyan desert to escape the contamination of Stambul. It is note-worthy that the supporters of all these movements were (a) Arabs, (5) uncivilised, and (c) independent, by force of arms, of either Ottoman or European control. The Ottoman doctrine of Pan-Islamism appealed, on the other hand, to settled, civilised Moslem populations under the government of European Powers like Britain, Prance, and Russia. &apos; These populations had seen enough of European institutions to wish for them themselves. They aspired to become self-governing nations playing an Independent part in international politics, and they admired Turkey because they believed her to be a Moslem State which already realised their ideal. They were not sufficiently well-informed to see through Turkey&apos;s European masquerade to the weakness and corruption underneath; they only saw in Turkey a model of what they hoped themselves to become, an existing guarantee for the political future of the peoples of Islam. Eor Islam is theoretically a political as well as a religious society. The Caliph is the temporal ruler of all good Moslems, as well as their religious head. It is true that this political unity broke down within a century of Mohammed&apos;s death, and has never been fully restored. But if the Caliph cannot exercise this universal power, the best alternative is that he should be an independent sovereign, powerful enough to make his wishes felt by the other sovereign states of the world, and this condition is fulfilled by the Sultan-Caliph at Constanti-nople ; for the Ottoman Empire is the strongest and most enduring Moslem State there has been since the fall of the Abbasids.The possibilities of political propaganda on these lines wrere perceived by Abd-ul-llamid, and he exploited them cleverly. The Ottoman strategic railway from Damascus to Medina, largely built out of the contributions of the Paithful from foreign countries, is a good example of his diplomacy; and this policy has been con-tinued by the C.IJ.P. In Tripoli, for instance, before the Italian conquest, the Ottoman Government was regarded by the natives as an irksome foreign oppression, but Ehver succeeded in winning over native sympathies; the Libyan Arab now looks on the Turk as his natural ally against the European invader; and even the Senussi has made common cause with him during the European war. In Asia the C.IJ.P. have posed as the liberators of Moslem States caught in British or Russian toils. They sent a mission to the Amir of Afghanistan which seriously embarrassed him in hisA  4043 * B
neutrality. In the districts oh &quot;Western Persia which they invaded they persuaded the Persian Nationalists to give them . armed support. They have suggested a triple alliance of Turkey, Persia, and Afghanistan, based on the idea of . political independence, for Islamic States. The &quot;Holy &quot;War.&quot; proclaimed in the name of the Caliph by the Sheikh-ul-Islam* in October 1914 has turned out a fiasco, but that is because Turkey has on the whole suffered military defeat. The pre-supposition of the Pan-Islamic policy is Ottoman military prestige. If Turkish armies had marched victoriously into. Tiflis, Cairo, and Teheran, and if the Allies had never threatened Constantinople or captured Baghdad,. Pan-Islamism might have produced far-reaching military and political effects, and even now it is by no means bankrupt.But this Pan-Tslabiic propaganda would; be ruined at once by a logical folio wing-but of the Pan-Turanian idea. If the Ottoman Empire is not an Islamic Great Power hut a Turkish National State, and if Turkish Nationalism and Islam are, ultimately irreconcilable, that snaps any special moral links between Turkey and the Moslem populations of other States. There is no more salvation for them in Turkey than in Britain or Bussia or Erance, and the C.U.P. have no more claim on them than their established governments. The C.U.P. realise this very well, and have avoided committing themselves openly to the Pan-Turanian creed where it is in flagrant contradiction to the Pan-Islamic. The Allies have laid hold of anti-Islamic and Anti-Arab declarations by Pan-Turanian writers, and. acts of tyranny and repression by C.U.P. officials in the Arab provinces, and these have served excellently as anti-Turkish propaganda in the Arab world. But it1 would be difficult to convict the C.U.P., as a party or a government, of a Pan-Turanian programme which would discredit their Pah-Islamic professions.The policy of the C.U.P. is to exploit both movements at once, and of the two Pan-Islamism is the more useful to them abroad, but at the same time it is clear that they set more . store by - Pan-Turanianism at home. Their object being to convert the Ottoman Empire into a highly organised militaristic state on the German pattern, they naturally find a more appropriate basis in common language than in common religion ; and the following passage occurs in a resolution passed at the C.H.P. Congress of October 1911 :-&quot;The character of the Empire must be Mohammedan, and respect must be secured for Moha,mmedan institutions and traditions. Other nationalities must be. denied the right of organisation, for decentralisation and autonomy are treason to the Turkish Empire. The nationalities are a negligible quantity. They can keep their religion but not their language. The propa-gation of the Turkish language is a sovereign means of confirming the Mohammedan supremacy and assimilating the other elements.&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;This illustrates how the C.U.P. try to combine the two ideas in their internal policy, and on which they lay more stress. The suggestion that the subject nationalities &quot; may keep . their religion but not their native language,&quot; is a complete reversal of the traditional policy of the early Ottoman&quot; conquerors, who allowed the Albanian and Bosnian nobility to keep not only their language but their estates when once they had accepted the Mohammedan religion.(9) Prospects of Turkish Irredentisnl Abroad.On the other hand, in estimating the possibilities of Pan-Turanian propaganda among Turkish populations outside the Ottoman Empire, it may be assumed that no Ottoman Govern -ment will pursue a policy in any \vay prejudicial to the Pan-Islamic* The same who afterwards resigned over the question of legal reforms.  .
idea,&apos;. It &quot;may also be assumed&apos; now that if the political re-union of the scattered branches of the Turkish race becomes a practical possibility (Avhich it is not af present), this will come about not through Ottoman military victories, but through the internal &quot;break-up&quot; of Russia. This &quot; break-up &quot; of Russia is frankly hoped for by &quot; Tekin Alp &quot; in fact it is the presupposition of his irredentist programme-but,-writing-before the Russian Revolution, he only looks forward to its being achieved from outside by the armies of Turkey and the Central Powers.The following are the chief groups of Turkish-speaking population outside Turkey which come into consideration: (a) The Tatars of Kazan (about 1^ Millions.These live;; along, the middle course of the Volga, between Nizhni Novgorod, and Samara. They are an almost isolated enclave,&apos;surrounded by great &quot;Russians&apos; on the west and Pinnish tribesf on the north and south; AThey are also intermingled with Russians&apos;in Kazan itself.&apos;. They have been under Russian Govern-ment more&apos; than three hundred years, and the barrier between Islam and Christianity has been broken down more successfully here than anywhere else in the world. The Kazan Tatars are prosperous and&apos;&apos;educated. The other Turkish-speaking groups hi Russia incline at present to follow their lead, and in the last few years their ,printin.g-presses have spread their influence widely through the Mohammedan world. The success or failure of J?an-Turtinianism as an Ottoman-Turk irredentist movement largely depends on the attitude which the Kazan Tatars adopt towards it, and this in turn depends upon the political evolution of Hussia.The Kazan Tatars sent Red Crescent workers and relief funds to Turkey during the Balkan War, but their sympathy is not likely to take a political form. Geography and material interests hind them to Russia, and they have a conservative temperament which would disincline them to break away violently from a State under which they have lived for three centuries.&apos; They naturally objected to the Tsarist regime, and in particular to its policy towards the non-Russian nationalities. Before the Revolution their point of view was roughly that of the Cadets.% But in the present situation they will agree neither with the anti-nationality policy for which the Cadets are coming to stand, nor with the extreme separatism of the Pinns and Ukrainians, which would leave them isolated, by, independent and probably chauvinistic States, from the Tatars of Crhnea and Caucasus. They are almost certain to declare for the Kerensky programme of national autonomy within a federal Russian Republic, for if Russia is Successfully reorganised on this basis, they have a brilliant future before them as the possible leaders of the Turkish-speaking element in a democratic state containing a considerable majority of the Turkish-speaking pbpu-lations of the world (about 16 million out of about 27 million altogether, whereas there are probably less than 8 million Turks in the Ottoman Empire.)  ;      &apos;In this event, Ottoman Irredenlism will collapse. The rallying point Of Pari-Turanianism will be- not Constantinople but Kazan, and &quot;so far from the Anatolian Turks&apos;attracting the Tatars into the Ottoman Empire, the Tatars of Russia will attract the Anatolian Turks.This very desirable ^solution - is chiefly endangered by the possibility of a-Russian reaction. A movement now in Russia for centralised military government and the repression of nationalities,!. * Including, the Tatars of Astrakhan, along the lower course of the Volga. &apos;.&apos; &quot;&quot; .&apos;, &apos; :      &quot;   &apos;    &quot;&apos;/.   . &quot;&apos;&apos;   &apos;.&apos; &quot;&apos;.&apos; &apos; &apos;        &apos;&quot;&apos; &apos;. .t; Nominally Christian, virtually still pagan, without a culture of their own, and capable of being assimilated by Tatars or Russians-whichever have the final ascendancy in this&quot;region, -J-&apos;In internal policy, that is. Th foreign policy they are violently opposed to the acquisition of Constantinople by Russia, which the Cadets desire.B 2
leading in all probability to civil war, might produce among the nationalities a sauve qui petti, in which the Tatars would be carried away. They would then turn for support to the Ottoman Empire, and Ottoman Irredentism might gain the clay, with disastrous results to the civilised world.(b) The Tatars of Crimea (under 200,000) will follow the lead of Kazan.(c) The Tatars of Western Siberia (about 50,000)* will follow the lead of Kazan.(d) The Tatars of the Caucasus (over 2,000,000).These are also under the influence of Kazan. On the other hand, they have been under Russian government less than a century; they live close to the Ottoman frontier; they have adopted Ottoman-Turkish as their literary (i.e., newspaper) language; and they have a strong interest in common with the Anatolian Turks in their fear and hatred of the Armenians. In 1905 there was a racial war between the Tatars and Armenians in the Caucasus, and on the whole the Armenians had the best of it.When Enver launched his disastrous invasion of the Caucasus in the winter of 19L1-5, the CUT. sent out propagandists to follow the Army, and drew up a scheme for partitioning the Caucasus and part of Turkish Armenia into autonomous Tatar, Georgian, and Armenian national states under Ottoman suzerainty. They tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade the Ottoman Armenians to co-operate with them in this scheme.As it was, the Ottoman armies never reached the Tatar districts of the Caucasus, and the only Russian subjects who sided with them were the Adshars, a Moslem tribe of Lazo-Georgian nationality in the district of Batum.Since the Russian Revolution the idea of national autonomy for the Caucasus and the occupied districts of Ottoman Armenia has been revived, only this time on the basis of federalism under Russia instead of Turkey. Tatars, Georgians, and Armenians are already wrangling over the delimitation of their national frontiers, and it is noticeable that, whereas formerly the Tatars and Georgians tended to combine against the more vigorous and progressive Armenians, there is now a Georgian-Armenian rap-prochement, while relations between Georgians and Tatars are strained because both are claiming the Adshars of the Batum district and the Lazes of the Ottoman Vilayet of Trebizond the Georgians on the ground of race, the Tatars of religion. This, however, may only be a passing phase, and in the land question, which is as important in the Caucasus as the demarcation of national boundaries, the old grouping of Georgian and Tatar versus Armenian is appearing again.The Tatars of the Caucasus are backward and paralysed by their sectarian division into Shias and Sunnis. If there is a government in Russia liberal enough to grant national autonomy, and strong enough to do justice between the various national claims, they will remain loyal to Russia, and in that case it may be predicted that Baku will in the end supersede Kazan as a political centre for the Turkish-speaking populations of Russia, and perhaps ultimately for all the Turks in the world. Kazan leads at present in virtue of its older culture, but Baku, with its oilfields, has a&apos; greater industrial future ; and while Kazan is on the periphery of the Turkish world, Baku lies at its &quot;middle point.* There are also in Western Siberia about 100,000 semi-Tatarised Ugro-Finns.
Kazan and Crimea, Anatolia and Azerbaijan, and the Central Asiatic bloc (via the Trans-Caspian Railway), are ranged in a circle round Baku, and are in easy communication with it.&apos; At the moment, too, the Baku Tatars seem to have produced stronger personalities among their leaders than the Tatars of Kazan. But the prospects of Baku depend upon the achievement of Russian federalism. If there is chaos or repression in Russia, the Tatars of the Caucasus will certainly turn to the Ottoman Empire, in which they could easily be incorporated, for they are almost in touch geographically with the Anatolian Turks, have accepted their literary language, and have not yet outdistanced them in culture. In this event they would vegetate as an outlying province of the Ottoman Empire, and the economic and cultural development of Baku would be cut short.(e) The Turkish-Speaking Populations in Persia.The migrations from Central Asia, between the 11th and 13th centuries A.B., which carried Turkish-speaking tribes to Kazan, the Caucasus, and Anatolia, also deposited them in the provinces of Persia north of the Central Desert especially in the most north-westerly province, Azerbaijan.These Turkish-speakers in Bersia have at present no Turkish national consciousness. They are Shias, like the Bersians, not Sunnis, like the Anatolian-Turks. Tekin Alp admits that they still write letters in Persian and read Persian newspapers, and, as a matter of fact, Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan, has been the centre of the Persian Nationalist movement.Tekin Alp wishes to give the Azerbaijanis a &quot; Turkish soul,&quot; and tries to prove that this would strengthen Persia internally. It would really split Persian Nationalism, and drive the Persians proper into hostility towards the Ottoman Empire, and the C.U.P. show no signs of committing such a blunder. Their policy during the war has been to support Persian Nationalism in Persia, and to inflame it against the Anglo-Russian regime. They are playing for a strong united Persia, freed from Anglo-Russian control, whicb would then make an alliance with the Ottoman Empire and fall under Ottoman hegemony.If it became clear that the Anglo-Russian regime could not be overthrown, the C.U.P. might then play for the smaller prize, and try to detach from Persia her Turkish-speaking populations. The Osmanlis have always coveted Azerbaijan; they occupied it more than once during the 16th and 17th centuries, and they overran it for a few weeks in the winter of 1914-5, as an incident in their Caucasus offensive.It is also possible that, if Persian Nationalism comes into power, it may adopt a chauvinistic internal policy, and try to Persianise its Turkish-speaking minority. In that case the Azer-haijanis might be roused to a consciousness of being Turks, and desire to cut themselves loose politically from Persia. They would turn first to the Tatars of the Caucasus, who also belonged to Persia before the Russian annexation, and who are only separated from the Azerbaijanis by an artificial frontier. The Azerbaijanis and Caucasian Tatars are bound in the end to gravitate in the same direction whether towards the Ottoman Empire or towards Russia.(f) The Turkish-speaking Population in Afghanistan.The provinces of Afghanistan between the Hindu-Kush and the Oxus are inhabited by a predominantly Turkish population. They were formerly independent Turkish (Uzbeg)&apos; Khanates like Khiva and Bokhara. They were only annexed by Afghanistan in 1850-9.   The situation is the same as in Bersia.   Pan-TuranianB 3
doctrinaires&apos;might like to-rouse these Uzhegs to a sense of. Turkish nationality-; the O.U.P. would prefer to draw the State, of Afghanistan into the Ottoman political orbit. :v(g) The Turks of Central Asia (about 13 million, 12 million of y     - whom are under Russia.)Turkish-speaking Central Asia is one of the largest continuous language areas in the world-larger than the Great Russian area and almost as large as the English or the Spanish-speaking area in America. It is bounded roughly by the Volga and Caspian on /the west, the Trans-Siberian Railway on the north, the Altai Mountains on the east, the Kwen-Lun and the Pamirs on. the south.. The whole of it except the Tarim basin (&quot;Chinese&quot; or &quot;Eastern&quot; Turkestan) at present belongs to Russia.-&quot;&apos; The continuity of its Turkish-speaking population is only broken by some.Cossack settle-ments in the north, and by the Persian-speaking Tajik peasantry and townspeople along, the Oxus and upper Syr Darya.Within this area there are great contrasts of. -economics and culture. The Bashkirs in the Ural District are. in transition from nomadism to agriculture. The Kirghiz, south of them, are still nomads, scattered over vast steppes. The Turkmans of the Trans-Caspian province (such asdiave survived the Russian;conquest) are not only -nomads but would still be predatory if they; dared-t South-eastward, on the other hand, along the rivers,rthere is a f airly dense agricultural,. population. In Eerghana, Samarkand and Tashkend, the Russians have accomplished a great deal of irrigation during the last 50 years, and have successfully fostered the cultivation of cotton. , In Chinese Turkestan, on the contrary, where European organisation has not yet come to the rescue, agriculture is fighting a losing battle against wind and sand.To set against these differences, there are powerful factors that make for unity the common language, a common, religion (for all these populations are devout Sunnis), and the common government and better communications that the Russian conquest has brought. The provinces along, the Oxus and Syr Darya, for example, which are the heart of Turkestan, are now linked up directly with Kazan by the Russian railway from Orenburg to Tashkend across the Kirghiz Steppe, and with Baku by the Trans-Caspian Railway and the steamship service across the Caspian Sea. ... , ,   : .     \      - hu,The problem of Turkish Nationalism in Central Asia was infinitely remote. before the [Russian Revolution ; the Revolution has made it imminent,.  , * ......We have little direct news of the effect which the Revolution has had here. There is said, to have been a rising in the autono-mous Khanates of Khiva and Bokhara, to extort a constitution from the Khans. Religious outbreaks are a more serious proba-bility. Before the Russian conquest Central Asia was a hot-bed of Sunni fanaticism. Khiva and Bokhara, which have never been brought directly under Russian administration, are likely to be fanatical still, and a spark struck here might set the whole region ablaze. If Russia falls, to pieces, Central Asia, will he the first fragment to break away. Cut the Tashkend and Trans-Caspian Railways, and it is isolated from Russia by a difficult belt of steppe and desert.   In the 19th century it took the Tsardom 20 years* And the Tarim basin will.in the .en.d gravitate towards the rest of the Central Asiatic Turkish-speaking area.&apos; It rebelled against China in the sixties of last century,. and maintained its independence for several years. Daring the last half century, it has been held down by force by Chinese garrisons. ,&apos;t In the ease of the&apos; Turkmans, civilisation has produced degeneration. The Russian conquest, overtook them hv &apos;a more primitive stage than most other Turkish stocks in Central Asia.  .   ;&quot;, ;.u. I- :
-to traverse this- belt- and conquer the provinces beyond it: A Russia shattered by the European War and the Revolution would have to postpone its reconquest indefinitely, if not for ever.The &quot;break-up &quot;of Russia thus opens greater opportunities for Ottoman Trredentism in Central Asia than in any other Turkish-speaking area. In Central Asia Pan-Turanianism and Pan-Islamism do not conflict with each other.The whole population is Turkish; the whole population is Sunni; and the present possessor-is not an ancient Moslem State, but a recent Christian conqueror. If Russia vanishes as a power from Persia and Central Asia, German-Ottoman diplomacy will certainly make serious efforts to erect a Turkish-Islamic State in Central Asia, which would then be-added as a fourth member to the projected Islamic alliance of Turkey. Persia and Afghanistan.1&apos;Such a state in such an alliance wrould threaten India in the gravest way. It would create a vast anti-British hinterland behind the anti-British tribes on the North-Western frontier. But if Russia breaks up, the British Empire will have to ward off this danger single-handed.The Pan- Turanian problem in Central Asia thus gives the British Empire a vital -interest in the internal evolution of PLussia  a permanent interest apart altogether from the War. Turkish-speaking Central Asia may either remain part of Russia and gravitate towards Baku and Kazan, or break away from Russia and gravitate towards Constantinople, and the latter alternative would directly prejudice our security.(h) The Yakuts (about 250,000).The Yakuts are a Turkish-speaking tribe thinly scattered over an immense area in the basin of the River Lena, extending to the shores of the Arctic Ocean. They are quite outside the range of any Pan-Turkish movement, for in the first place they are either pagans or nominal Christians, not Moslems; and secondly they are separated from the other branches of the Turkish race by a broad belt of non-Turkish populations pagan Tungus and Buddhist Mongols.10. Prospects of Turkificationin the Ottoman Empire.A survey of the Turkish-speaking world outside Turkey seems to show that Ottoman Irredentism will only become a serious possibility if there is a &quot; break-up&quot; of Russia. It remains to examine the other aim of Pan-Turanianism the Turkification of the non-Turkish nationalities inside the Ottoman frontiers. This depends primarily on the territorial condition in which Turkey emerges from the European War.   . . ,(a) Turhification and the Arabs.The Arab policy of the C.U.P. has been their greatest failure in the War. Its extent can be measured by the success of the Arab movement promoted by Great Britain. But it would not be safe to assume that the C.E.P. wdll let us go on playing such a good card as this without trying to trump it. We cannot trust to their Pan-Turanianism to prevent them bidding against us, even thus late in the day, for Arab support.We and the Sherif have both given great prominence, in our propaganda, to the supposed designs of the C.TJ.P. against the Arab nationality. But how far are the C.U.P. really committed to the Turkification of their Arab provinces ? It is true that they have appointed the Pan-Turanian feminist, Halide Edib Hanum, to be principal of a new Government College for women at Beirut, but their object here is to supersede the Erench and American institutions at Beirut by an institution under Ottoman Govern-mental control.   Their primary aim is thus not nationalist butB 4
political rather the elimination of external influences from the Empire than the extension of Turkish influence within it at the Arabs&apos; expense.It is true, too, that Djemal has executed or imprisoned a number of Arab notables in Syria but this was for treason (actual or prospective) against the Ottoman Government.Members of the Turkish Opposition, too, have been executed or exiled for the same offence; and the C.U.P. evidently do not consider that their severities in Syria can be interpreted con-vincingly as racial persecution; for when in their defence of the Armenian atrocities they try to prove that they were not setting out to exterminate an alien race, but merely punishing political traitors, they actually refer to their treatment of the Syrian notables to prove this point, on the assumption that in Syria no racial motive can possibly be imputed.Again, it has been said that the Turks have been deliberately starving the Syrian population to death, but this is only true of the Lebanon Vilayet. The Turks did cut off supplies from the Lebanon ancl reduce it to submission by famine. But this was not because the Lebanon was Arab, but because it was autonomous. Administrative centralisation is one of the principal aims of the O.U.P., and is sufficient, without the motive of nationalism, to explain their action here. In the rest of Syria there has been great distress, but that is clue to the Blockade ancl to the disorganisation automatically caused by the War. It cannot be proved that the distress has been deliberately produced by the C.U.P. as an anti-Arab move, and they have struck no general blow at the Syrian Arabs like the Armenian massacres or the deportation of the Jews from Jaffa.On the other hand, there is definite evidence that the C.U.P. are prepared, if necessary, to make concessions to the Arabs. Almost their first act on intervening in the War was to grant the Imam Yahya, in the Yemen, terms which practically gave him the independence for which he has been fighting for years. They have offered similar terms to the Sherif, and this before they have abandoned the hope of being able to crush him by force/&apos; And there have been rumours recently that they mean to promulgate a very generous scheme of autonomy for Syria, Mesopotamia and Armenia before they enter into negotiations for peace.These rumours are likely to be true, &quot; Autonomy&quot; is the card Turkey has always played when her integrity has been in danger; and though in Europe autonomy, once conceded, has generally developed into independence, because it has been guaranteed by the removal of Turkish military control,! in Asia it has so far resulted in the maintenance of the Turkish dominion. The six Armenian vilayets, for instance, were promised autonomy in 1878, when they were under Russian occupation; the promise was endorsed by the Bowers, but from that day to this Armenia has had nothing from the Ottoman Government except massacres ancl coercion. Zeitoun (in the Cilician highlands) and the Lebanon Vilayet (in Syria) were actually in possession of autonomy when Turkey entered the War, but the C.U.B. have been able now to take their privileges away again and garrison both territories with Turkish troops.These precedents would encourage the C.U.B. to make reckless offers of autonomy to their subject nationalities in Asia, in order to thwart the &quot; annexationist &quot; intentions of the Allies, even if they did not mean to carry out such offers in good faith.   But is it safe* They were ready to recognise his political and ecclesiastical authority in the Hejaz under Ottoman suzerainty, but stated frankly that they could not for a minute consider any claims to the Caliphate on his part a reserva-tion which shows what importance they still attach to their Pan-Islamic policy.t E.g., in the cases of Bulgaria, Eastern Rumelia, and Krete.
to assume their insincerity ? The paramount object of the C.TJ.P. is to make the Ottoman Empire an independent military power, strong enough to be the political rallying point of the Moslem World, and in pursuing this object they will not let doctrinaire Turkish Nationalism stand in their way. Turkification for them is merely a means to their object; they will not deliberately persist in it when it turns out to have a contrary effect. And one can imagine circumstances in which they would serve their ultimate object best by adopting the reverse of this policy towards the Arabs.Assume, for example, that they are unable to recover Meso-potamia and Armenia, but can get peace on the basis of the present war-map. This would leave them Syria and Northern Mesopotamia, with something over five million Arabs, in addition to Anatolia, with something under eight million Turks. They could still play the part of a great power, if within these limits they developed their latent political, military and economic resources, and these would all lie in the Arab areas. Syria and Northern Mesopotamia, not Anatolia, would offer the possibilities of increased population and economic production which a &quot;great power&quot; policy would demand, and the military centre of gravity would also shift into this zone.Until the present war the Ottoman Empire has always faced, in the military sense, towards Europe, and the Turkish-speaking region of Anatolia has formed the natural base for this European front. But the C.U.B. have now drawn the moral from the Balkan War of 1913 which Austria drew from the Prussian War of I860. They have made up their minds that the situation on their &quot;Western frontier has reached its final equilibrium; that on this side they have nothing more to hope or fear; ancl that they had better make friends with their former rivals here, ancl turn their faces resolutely towards the south-east. The rectification of the Thracian frontier in Bulgaria&apos;s favour in the autumn of 1915 corresponds morally to the alliance Austria made with Germany in 1878. Austria then hoped to find her compensation in a hegemony over the Balkans; Turkey hopes to find hers now in the leadership of the Islamic world. Austria prepared for the new orientation of her foreign policy by broadening her basis internally; Turkey, having re-oriented herself in a similar sense, may follow this up by a similar reconstruction within. The Austro-Hungarian Brang nach Osten rests on Magyar-German Dualism; the Ottoman Drang nach Osten may, in the near future, be founded by the C.U.B. on an Ausgleich between the Arab and the Turk. Such a policy would not only be dictated by the circumstances; it would commend itself peculiarly to the opportunist temperament of the C.U.P. leaders, beoause it would remove the contradiction between Pan-Turanianism and Pan-Islamism, and make it possible for them to pursue both aims openly together. The Anatolian provinces of the Ottoman Empire would be reserved for Turkish Nationalism, and would be a potential focus for all the Turks; the Arab provinces would be made over to their Arab population as a focus for other Arabs; and the two halves of the Empire, linked together strategically ancl economically by the Taurus and Amanus railway-tunnels, would form between them a Moslem &quot; great power,&quot; appealing by its internal constitution and its external strength to the political sympathy of the Islamic world.It is unnecessary to point out what a menace such a re-organised Ottoman Empire would be to Bussia, Erance and Great Britain. Its greatest anxiety would be that its remaining Arab territories might be taken from it by European powers; its greatest ambition would be to re-unite with these territories the Arab provinces under European government. These provinces would be in direct territorial contact with the autonomous Arab half of the new Ottoman State; most of them would have been ancienta   4.043 c
appanages of the Ottoman Empire the nearest, such as Mesb-potamia and the Hejaz, down to as recent: a date as the European War. Under these circumstances the Ottoman Empire would inevitably remain profoundly hostile to the British Empire, and would possibly attract towards itself the allegiance of the Arab populations in the British sphere.The inference, from the point of view of British interests, appears to be that the Arab movement is a double-edged weapon. If we are able to press it home, it will bring us extraordinary advantages ; but if Turkey manages to retain any considerable Arab territories - considerable enough, that is, to leave her still strong enough to play the part of an Islamic great power-the C.U.P. will do anything they can to wrest the Arab weapon from us. This is the Pan-Islamic policy, and if we rely on their Pari-Turanianism tb restrain them from following it, we are in danger of being the dupes of our own propaganda.,: (b) Turkification in Anatolia.The Turkish language possesses great vitality. Wherever Turkish-speaking peoples go, they impress themselves on the land-scape ; Turkish names of mountains, rivers and towns (monotonous and unimaginative though they are) tend to drive out the ancient nomenclature ; and the conquered populations begin to use Turkish as their household language, even though they do not intermarry with the Turks, and though they adhere jealously to their ancestral culture and religion. This process was taking place peacefully in Anatolia before the war. Among the Armenians in the Oilician Highlands it was practically complete-^-their vernacular language had become Turkish instead of Armenian and the dialect of the Greek enclaves in the Kaisaria district was in an amazing stage of transition from Greek to Turkish. The first translations of the Bible which the American missionaries found it advisable to make were into the Turkish language, written in Greek and Armenian characters, and that was early in the 19th century. Even without the racial war of extermination which the O.U.P. have waged in Anatolia and Armenia since the spring of 1915 --first against the Armenians and now against the Greeks the Turkish language would before long have become the universal vernacular speech of the Anatolian peninsula, from the Aegean to the Euphrates.But the recent massacres and deportations have swept away not only non-Turkish languages but non-Turkish cultures. The Turkish-speaking or semi-Turkish-speaking Greeks and Armenians of Anatolia, with their religion, literature, education, industry and economic efficiency, have been removed, and their places have been taken by Muhajirs Moslem emigrants from, the lost Ottoman provinces in Europe, who are perhaps on a higher level than the native Turks of Anatolia, but are also brutalisecl by hardships, and made fanatical by their voluntary exile. The Muhajirs are quite jncapahle of compensating for the lost Greeks and Armenians as a factor of civilisation ; and as (in Anatolia at any rate, whatever may happen in Armenia east of the Euphrates) there,seems little prospect of repatriation for the Armenians still surviving in the Mesopotamian exile-camps, the country will presumably have to start after the War from the low-water mark of Turkish barbarism.The native Anatolian Turk, diluted with the Rumelian Muhajir, will be the material on which the Turkish national movement will have to work.   What are its prospects ?The prospects are bad if. the Ottoman Government retains sufficient non-Turkish territory to give it still the status of.&quot;a great power. In that event the O.U.P. will certainly sacrifice the Turkish nation in Anatolia to the demands of military imperialism, as it has.always been sacrificed before. But if the Ottoman State is confined to Anatolia, it is possible that these ambitions may he
broken, and the constructive side of nationalism represented in the PanrTuranian movement by figures like Halide Edib PEanum -may then, come, to the fore.In that case one may prophesy for a Turkish National State in Anatolia the same course of development which the Balkan nationalities have gone through since their liberation from the Ottoman Empire.  There is no reason to suppose that the Anatolian Turk is, ultimately less capable. of civilisation than the Balkan peoples.   There is very little in him of the real Turkish blood from Central Asia; the strongest strain in his race is the aboriginal Anatolian  peasantry, which turned Turk en, masse after  the Seljuks had overrun the country in the 11th century A.D.   The ancient Anatolian was able to assimilate the civilisation of Greece and Borne ;  why should his descendents not assimilate that of Modern Europe ?   Only the process wdl be slow.   The Turk now is much more backward than the Greek and the Serb a century ago, and Islam is a more serious handicap on the growth of a nation than the Orthodox Church.   The first stage in a Turkish national regeneration would have to be a struggle against the reactionary Islamic tradition a real struggle and not the burlesque aping of European anti-clericalism which one finds in &quot;Tekin Alp.&quot; If a constructive movement of this kind really sets in, it will certainly be supported warmly by the Kazan and Baku Tatars and the other Turkish-speaking peoples of Bussia ; and in fact, if the federalisation of the Russian Empire and the break-up of the Ottoman Empire are both accomplished as a result of the war, the Tatars of Bussia will probably play the same beneficent part in the risorgimento of the Anatolian Turks that the Russians them-selves have played in the history of the Balkan Slavs.   This is the only form in which the realisation of the Ban-Turanian idea is either probable or desirable.11. Conclusions.(a) The Ottoman Turk has no &quot; Pan-Turanian&quot; sense of kinship with any nation in Europe. The policy of the C.TJ.B. towards Europe is quite unsentimental, it aims at the maximum of European assistance to Turkey combined with the minimum of European control.(b) The power of the Ottoman Empire rests de facto upon the Turkish population in Anatolia, and there is a very obvious linguistic kinship between all the Turkish-speaking populations in the world. It is therefore natural that a Turkish national con-consciousness should arise among the Osmanlis, and that this should be accompanied by a &quot; Pan-Turkish &quot; consciousness as well.((?) Nationalism was stimulated among the Osmanlis by the shock of the Balkan War, but it is important to distinguish between the doctrinaire nationalists and the C.TJ.B. The C.U.B. always think in terms of the Ottoman State rather than of the Turkish nationality.(d) Above all, the C.U.P. will never sacrifice their Pan-Islamic policy either to Turkish Nationalism at home or to Turkish Irredentism abroad.(e) Turkish Irredentism clashes too much with Pan-Islamism to become a practical policy for the C.U.P., but they might take it up in certain cases in the unlikely event of a &quot; break-up &quot; of Russia.if) The &quot; break-up &quot; of Russia would gravely prejudice British interests in Asia; the possibility of a &quot; break-up &quot; depends largely on the attitude of the Turkish-speaking populations of Russia, and these have two centres the old centre of Kazan ancl the newer centre of Baku. The policy of the Kazan ancl Baku Tatars towards the internal development of Russia therefore affects British interests directly.0 2    &apos;
(g) Eor our Arab movement, Pan-Turanianism is good propa-ganda but nothing more. The C.U.P. will drop the policy of trying to Turkify the Arabs when they find that it is weakening the Ottoman State. They are even likely to offer the Arabs autonomy, and to turn the Ottoman Empire, if they can, into a Turco-Arab State, with a Pan-Islamic and strongly anti-British policy. . -(Ji) If the Ottoman Empire ceases to be a great power, there may be a genuine Turkish national revival in Anatolia. In such a revival, the Turkish-speaking peoples of Russia would probably play the same part that Russia herself has played towards the Balkan Slavs.This is the only form in which the Pan-Turanian idea is ever likely to he realised.A. J. T.
Appendix I. The Kurds.From the Pan-Turanian point of view the Kurds have considerable importance as a negative factor. They are an Iranian people, speaking dialects of Persian, and their original home is in the mountain ranges which separate the plateau of Persia from the basin of Mesopotamia. South-eastward they are adjoined by kindred mountain populations the Lurs and Bakhfciaris  and their expansion has been principally in the opposite, or north-westerly, direction.This expansion has been closely connected with the Turkish migrations. When the Turks made their way from Central Asia into Northern Persia, in the 11th century A.D.,&apos;they did not dislodge the Kurds, who had occu-pied the western ramparts of the Persian plateau for about 3,000 years. They avoided the Kurdish mountains, and turned northwards into Azer-baijan, up the valley of the Araxes, and so into Armenia and Anatolia by a route that left Kurdistan untouched. Anatolia was their goal and Armenia their high road, with the result that, after migrations which went on intermittently for five centuries, Anatolia had become the seat of a new Turkish nation, while Armenia was left depopulated and half desolate. This was the Kurds&apos; opportunity. Kurdish tribes drifted into the vacuum which the Turks had made ; and they have gradually spread over the lake country of Urmia and Van, and the upper valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, till they have come almost within sight of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.Prom the point of view of &quot; Pan-Turanian &quot; geography, they have thus possessed themselves of a strategical position. Stretching in a broad arc from a point north of Aleppo to a point east of Baghdad, they form an almost continuous buffer between the Turkish-speaking populations of Anatolia, the Caucasus, and Azerbaijan, on the one hand, and the Arab world on the other. And what is still more important, they combine with the Armenians, and with certain Indigenous mountain tribes of Armenia now classed as Kurds,* to cut off the Anatolian (Ottoman) Turks from all the Turks further east. During the Armenian massacres of 1915, a Turkish gendarme said to a Danish Bed Cross Nurset: &quot; First we kill the Armenians, then the Greeks, and then the Kurds &quot; ; and so far as the Pan-Turanian idea was a motive for the treatment of the Armenians by the CU.P., the gendarme was stating the logical consequences of his superiors&apos; policy.On the other hand, under the old regime; before the Ottoman Empire began to be either a centralised or a nationalistic state, the Kurds were the most faithful and favoured supporters of the Ottoman Government, and their expansion towards the north and west was in great part due to Ottoman encouragement.When the Osmanlis conquered Armenia at the beginning of the 16th century, their main concern was to establish a bulwark against Persia, and the Kurdish tribes served excellently for the purpose. Notwithstanding their Persian dialect, the Kurds have not, and never had, a vestige of Persian national feeling. Their social consciousness is limited by the tribe, the sole object of tribal policy is to evade external control, and in the 16th and 17th centuries the Persian Government, which was near and powerful, seemed a more immediate menace to tribal independence than the distant Ottoman Government at Constantinople. The Ottoman Government was content with a nominal suzerainty over the Kurdish chiefs, and in return the Kurds guarded the Ottoman Empire&apos;s Persian frontiers playing the same role here as the Bosniaks and Albanians in the Balkans.Friction between the Kurds and the Ottoman Government began in the early 19th century, when Sultan Mahmud reduced the semi-independent Kurdish chiefs in Armenia ^and Kurdistan, and set up the beginnings of an official Ottoman administration in their place.J This centralising policy was reversed about 1890 by Abd-ul-Hamid, who hoped to keep his various subjects in subjection by playing them off against each other and weakening them all. Abd-ul-Hamid gave the Kurds rifles, and their chiefs the title of commanders of Hamidie gendarmerie, and let them loose on the Armenians ; but Ottoman policy was reversed again in 1908 by the C.U.P., who hoped to regenerate the Empire by unity and internal strength. The C.U.P. attempted to call the Kurds to order, and they had a notable success in subduing the practically independent Milli Confederation built up by Ibrahim Pasha. But they could not call in the arms which Abd-ul-Hamid had given out, though they improved the situation by allowing the Christian population to bear arms too.As soon, however, as they intervened in the European War, the C.U.P. went back deliberately to Abd-ul-Hamid&apos;s policy.   They distributed more* Chiefly in the Dersim highlands, between the two branches of the upper Euphrates.j They were travelling from Erzerum to Sivas, along the ancient route of the Turkish migrations.   (See Blue Book, Misc. 31 (1916), p. 253.)J This was the Sultan who destroyed Ali Pasha of Janina.and lost Greece, and it is notable that the CD.P., in pursuing the same policy from 1908 to 1913, were also successful against the Kurds (breaking up the power of Ibrahim Pasha), but failed to reduce Albania and lost Macedonia.-     C 3

Appendix 2. Anti-Islamic Tendencies in the Pan-TuranianMovement.There are several distinct degrees of opposition to Islam in the Pan-Turanian movement.: &apos; (a) Ziya Bey&apos;s&apos;gr6up first.came into conflict with Islam over the language 1 question.   They probably thought of translating the Koran, &amp;c.&apos;&quot; into Turkish, because they knew that the translation of the Bible &apos; and Christian liturgy into English and G-erman at the Protestant : Reformation, had been the foundation of the modern English and -erman national literatures.   The idea is not intrinsically contrary *-:.&apos;&apos;-?    &apos; to the Mohammedan, Eeligion, any more than the action of Luther arid the translators of the Authorised Version was anti-Christian ; but it is distinctly contrary to Islamic prejudice, and has there-:&apos;:&apos;r&apos;    1 fore not been taken up by the C.U.P.The opposition of the Moslem ecclesiastics to the translation of the Koran into Turkish led the Turkish Nationalists into an attack on Islam as an ecclesiastical institution.   This secularist movement, too, is partly an imitation of Europe,&apos;as &quot; Tekin Aip&apos;s &quot; use of the word &quot;clericals &quot; shows; but it also embodies sound and necessary reforms like the secularisation of Education aiid the Law, and 1   steps in this direction, have been taken by the C.U.P. themselves. The chief difference on this head between the C.U.P. and the doctrinaires   is   that,  while  the   latter  trumpet  their   &quot; anti-clericalism,&quot; the G;U.P. try to carry secularisation through with &apos; as little friction as possible, and without ever admitting that their measures are anti-Islamic, (c) The Nationalists have also started a &quot; pre-Islamic &quot; movement which &apos;   :&apos;--is only paralleled in Europe by the &quot; TJr-Deutschtum&quot; of the-;; Hindenburg wooden idols.   They are making a sentimental cult of*-&apos;    - - &quot;the &apos; pagan Turanian cdriqtierdrs, like Jenghis Khan and Hulaku (both of  whom, incidentally, were  Mongols and not Turks). - Members of the &quot;TurkKuji&quot; (&quot; Turkish Power &quot;) Society-an association for the promotion of physical culture, probably modelled on the Slavonic &quot; Sokols &quot;- have ; to take &quot; Turanian &quot; club-names in place of Moslem (e.g., &quot; Oghuz &quot; for &quot; Mohammed &quot;); and a corps of Turkish Boy-scouts has been instituted, who likewise take &quot; Turanian &quot; scout-names, cheerfor the &quot; khakan of the Turks &quot; instead of the &quot;Padishah,&quot; and carry flags with the Turkish wolf on them, though the representation of living creatures in art is &apos; tabu :to good Moslems.&apos; 1Enver is said to be the patron of these boy scouts; a Turkish army order has come into the hands of the British War Office, directing the troops to include the&quot; Grey Wolf &quot; in their prayers; and the Turanian idea seems to have made a certain progress among , individual Turks of distinction, even in this fantastic form. For instance, King Hussein&apos;s troops have captured, on the corpse of a brother of. the-Turkish Comrriandant at Medina, a circular issued by the principal Pan-Turanian Society in Turkey, the &quot; Turk Ojaghi &quot; (&quot;Turkish Family&quot;), in which the following passage occurs :  &quot; That monstrous figment of imagination which is known as the Community of Islam, and which has for long past stood in the way of present progress generally, and of the realisation of the principles of Turanian Unity in particular, has now entered on a phase of - decline and ruin. We need not apprehend from it any further danger to ^the execution of our hopes-arid principles. -This is abundantly . shown by the state of affairs among the Moslems in India   .   .&apos;   .   .&quot; &quot;This circular derives a. certain Importance from its source and ownership, but there is no evidence that the&quot; Back to Paganism&quot; moyement has any , influence over the policy of the. C.U.P.      : .....
Appendix 3.-Text of an open letter addressed to M. Tereschenko, Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, by the Executive Committee of the All-Russian Mohammedan Council, with reference to the proclamation by Italy of her protectorate over Albania.&quot;Italy has proclaimed the independence&apos; of Albania under her pro-tectorate. If the press may be relied upon, this step taken by Italy was aV complete surprise to the diplomatic representatives of the powers allied to Italy. The diplomatic representatives of Russia, England and France had made it clear to the Italian Government that in their opinion the problem of Albania should have been solved after the end of the War in an International Congress. The Albanian problem thus raised by the action of Italy, and the attitude which you, Minister-Citizen, have adopted in the matter as the responsible leader of the foreign policy of the Russian Democracy, induce the Executive Committee of the All-Russian Mohammedan Council to address to you this open letter.&quot; The fate of Albania, which falls under the protectorate of a European Power, recalls in this respect the destinies of Algeria, Tunis, Egypt, Morocco, Afghanistan, and other Mohammedan countries. The history of the Moham-medan peoples of those countries arouses a strong sentiment of sympathy in the hearts of the many millions of free Mohammedans in Russia. And now to the tragedies overtaking the above-mentioned Mohammedan countries there is also added the tragedy of the Albanian people, which is being sacrificed to imperialistic designs of the Italian governing classes. The All-Russian Mohammedan Conference passed a Resolution in Moscow in which it stated its attitude towards the War, &apos; That this Conference thinks &apos; the cause of this world-slaughter lies in the imperialistic tendencies of &apos; European ruling classes, and it protests against that policy wherever it &apos; exists, because Mohammedans all the world over are victims of European .&apos; imperialism.&apos;&quot; The fate of Albania is a new illustration of European robbery in the history of imperialism, and again the victim is a mainly Mohammedan people. Hand-in-hand with the Russian Revolutionary Democracy and as a party to its formula of peace without annexations and indemnities based on the right of peoples to decide their own fate, the Executive Committee of the All-Russian Mohammedan Council expected from you a definite and uncompromising policy towards the Albanian problem.&quot; But, alas! that hope has not been fulfilled. The Committee expected that the leading organs of the Russian Revolution would have made their powerful voice heard.   But that hope also has been falsified.&quot; On behalf of many millions of Mohammedan Democrats in Russia, we therefore publish this protest.&quot; Our Executive Committee thinks that in this problem you, as the Foreign Minister in the Provisional Government, could take clear and definite action.&quot;Every people must decide its own fate by a plebiscite. In that way alone can the fate of the Albanian people be settled; whereas you seem to be inclined to solve the Albanian problem by the International Peace Conference. The Russian Democracy Was entitled to expect from you a declaration of the Albanian people&apos;s right to political self-determination in such a way as not to leave any occasion for doubt.&quot; Only a policy like that traced above, worthy of the Russian Democracy, could inspire the All-Russian Mohammedan Council with confidence that the men responsible for the high authority of the Russian Revolution correspond to that great formula in problems of foreign as well as internal policy.&quot; Your dubious and indecisive attitude towards the Albanian problem rouses suspicioir and doubt among the Mohammedans of Russia, particularly in consequence of tho.se bitter experiences of centuries past during which the Mohammedans all the world over have learnt the meaning of what is called European justice.&quot;The Executive Committee of the All-Russian Mohammedan Council publishes this protest and considers it absolutely essential to inform you that, in the opinion of the Mohammedan democracy of Russia, the principles of&apos; cultural liberty and the right of political self-determination belong not only to the peoples of Europe but also to those of Asia and Africa. The Executive Committee assumes that you are acquainting our Allies with this point of view and that it is being thoroughly comprehended by their governing circles.&quot;
25205SUPPLEMENT TO  REPORT ON  THE  PAN-TURANIANMOVEMENT.While the Report was in the Press, a new statement on the Pan-Turanian Movement was communicated to the Department of Information.This statement is a tendentious document. The author of it is attempting to demonstrate that the existence of the Pan-Turanian Movement renders the pro-Arab policy of Great Britain not only futile but positively dangerous to British interests, and he accuses the Turkish Armenians falsely of treachery towards the Ottoman Government. But he also alleges certain facts, which, if true, add considerably to our information.This factual element in the document may be summarised as follows :-(i) Names of personalities concerned in the Movement.(a) Turks. Marshal Euacl Pasha ; Dr. Riza Tewfik0 ; Nejib Eifendi; Dr. Abdullah Jevdet.(b) Russian Moslems. Professor Yussuf Akchura; Obeidullah Tashkendi; Kniaz Aziz Bey; Prince Kaplan Zade; the son of Sheikh Shamil (leader of the resistance to the Russian conquest of Daghestan in the 19th century).(c) Germans. Dr. Martin Hartmann; Professor von Luschan (Austrian) ; Rudolf Ptotheit; Freiherr von Mackay ; Professor (C. H. ?) Becker.V. B. The author ascribes as much influence to Professor Hartmann&apos;s writings as to M. Leon Oahun&apos;s, and states that they are being widely read at present in Turkey. (Hartmann&apos;s chief work seems to he contained in two volumes of studies and monographs, entitled &apos;:Der Islamische Orient.&quot;)*(ii) Influence of Jews.The author states that Hartmann&apos;s writings are popular in Pan-Turanian circles because they are anti-Islamic, and ascribes this anti-Islamic tendency in the Movement to the Salonika Jews (descended from Spanish Jews to whom the Ottoman Government gave asylum in the 16th century), and to the Donme (a group of crypto-Jewish Salonika Moslems, descended from forced converts of the 17th century). He distinguishes this European Jewish element in Turkey, which is philo-Turk and in sympathy with Turkish Nationalism, from the Jews scattered through Asiatic Turkey, whom he states to be under the influence of American Jewry and to look toAvards Palestine.(iii) Abandonment of lire Baghdad Scheme.The British successes in Mesopotamia haAre made the Germans despair of &quot; Berlin-Baghdad.&quot; This statement is remarkably confirmed by the independent statement of a distinguished German economist in Dr. Helfferich&apos;s entourage.(iv) Compensation in &quot;Russia.On the other hand, the apparent political and military collapse of Russia has led the Turks and Germans to look for compensation at Russia&apos;s expense for losses elseAvhere/f&quot;* Doubt is cast on his participation by an informant who knows him personally.t The Germans are certainly paying great attention now to the Turkish-speaking and other Moslem populations of Russia. The new German fortnightly, &quot; Der Neue Orient&quot; (started in April 1917), announces its special interest in them, and gives them many articles and paragraphs.A   (33)404;!-2   Pk 17   500   11/17
&quot; Since the Russian Revolution, the [Pan-Turanian] Movement has received an impetus which, in their wildest dreams, the leaders in Constantinople and Berlin had not looked forward to.   .   .   .&quot; Up to the time of the Russian Revolution the Move-ment was an idea in the hands of men who . . . had no intention of carrying out the plans they made, as they realised that Russia would stop the Movement on the borders of Persia. But the Russian Revolution has entirely changed the character of the Movement.   .   .   .&quot;(v) Berlin-Bokhara.The Ban-Turanian policy reckons on the loss (at any rate temporarily) of some or all of Turkey&apos;s Arab provinces, but hopes in compensation to build a new Turkish Empire on a Turanian basis, at Russia&apos;s expense and in a sphere where Great Britain cannot intervene. Its first objective is the Russian Caucasus ; through the Caucasus it aims at the vast Turkish-speaking populations of Russian and Chinese Central Asia; and its ultimate aspirations include Southern Bersia, Beluchistan and Afghanistan. Its ambitions thus clash directly with the security of India.&quot; The Berlin-Baghdad Bailway may die, but the Berlin-Bokhara line through Asia Minor and Northern Persia will live.   This is the new German ambition.&quot;This new strategic railway, if it is really projected, would presumably follow the existing line from Con-stantinople to Angora; the next section, from Angora to Sivas, is said to be under construction already; from Sivas the route would run, via Erzindjan and Erzerum, to join the Caucasian Railway system at Sarykamish. This would at once bring Constantinople into connection with Baku and Tabriz, and from these termini two alternative routes are available: (a) The sea-passage across the Caspian from Baku to Krasnovodsk, and from Krasnovodsk by the existing Trans-Caspian Railway to Bokhara and beyond; or (5) a new railway, starting from Tabriz, running across Northern Bersia (where there would be no great engineering difficulties), and joining the Trans-Caspian Railway at Merv.This all-laud route would be a direct menace to the British position in the Bersian Gulf, and would seriously threaten India from the West and North-west.A.

HEJAZ   AND  EGYPT.The history of Hejaz, since the expansion of Islam established it in the \world&apos;s eye, has been governed by the fact that it can neither finance nor feed itself. The primitive economic, difficulties of the towns, Mecca, Medina, Jiddah, Yambo, etc., as well as of the rural districts, settled and un-settled, were aggravated as Hejaz gradually developed into a goal of pilgrimage from all parts of the East, the pilgrims including a large proportion of persons whose demands were on a higher plane of civilization. Though the hay brought money into the country, at the same time it compelled expenditure on the safeguarding and watering of routes, on accommodation, on entertainment, on upkeep and embellishment of holy places and on many other accounts, which taken together went beyond native means: ancl, although food caravans usually accompanied the pilgrims, these did not bring nearly enough for the whole sojourn, which often extended to months. Taif can supply Mecca, in a certain measure, with vegetables, fruit and meat, but the Holy City itself has no grazing anywhere near it for a considerable head of livestock, and none but isolated patches of lean corn dand. Medina is the only district in Hejaz, which produces any surplus of dates, and its crop is uncertain. Roundly it may be said that Hejaz, as a whole, has never been able to supply its local needs with either cereals or pastoral products ; that its chief cities, since they became places of pilgrimage, have depended on external subsidies for their municipal expenditure, and have not contributed to general revenue ; that nothing to speak of can be raised from the rural Hejaz population without causing it forthwith to cease producing its own food ; and that the indirect revenue to be derived from customs duties has never proved enough to offset the extraordinary administrative expenses involved by the pilgrimage. Nor have the resources of the contiguous and neiffhbourin&quot;- districts of Arabia, ever been of a kind or a measure to make good the deficiencies of Hejaz. In the way of food, Qasim sends it butter, and the Ateibah steppe, mutton ; but their moderate supplies are subject to much fluctuation through droughts and insecurity of transit. The Asir Tihamab has, in a good year, a little wheat, maize and millet to spare. More than one attempt has been made by Emirs of Mecca in the past to exploit the resources of the Yemen on behalf of Hejaz. These efforts have never come to anything, not so much because the caravan roads are very long, arduous and perilous, as because Yemen has next to no foodstuffs to spare. With coffee and kat cultivation to maintain, its comparatively dense popula-tion grows no more cereals, and keeps no more livestock, than suffice to feed itself. Yemen exports neither corn nor cattle worth reckoning in consular trade reports.Hejaz, therefore, for the last ten centuries at any rate, has had to depend on external  purveyors, who, inevitably have
become external protectors ; and of. such the successive lords of Egypt have filled the part during almost the whole period from the dynasty of the Tuhmids to that of Mohammed Ali. It was so as early as the tenth century. Snouck-Hurgronje, the most competent European historian of Hejaz, writes (Mekka I. p. 54) : &quot;In the year 969, as the chronicles tell us, the Fatimites acquired at a great price first place in the Pilgrimage to the exclusion of the Ahbasids, and ever since then the honour of mention in the Friday prayer has gone to the highest bidder... &apos; Hejaz is always dependent on Egypt for its means of life&apos; wrote a geographer (Mokadassi) a few years later ; and if the Nile flood did not reach its accustomed height, Mecca went hungry for a year.&quot;Whoever possessed himself of Egypt, conquered, ipso facto, Hejaz Saladin first, then the Mamelukes, then the Circassian Sultans, and finally the Ottoman Turks. The lord of the Nile for the time being needed no more display of armed force, than usually escorted the Mahmal, to assert himself in Mecca. He held the key of the larder and that was enough. The sub-servience of the Grand Sherifs left little to be desired for many centuries. The)&apos; professed Shiah tenets wdth the first Fatimites, and proclaimed their faith in the Caliph Hakim. When Selim &quot;the Grim&quot; sent to claim the dependencies of Egypt, they were as good Sunnis as any Turk. Their subsequent access of independence in the eighteenth century was independence not of Egyptian supplies, but of political control, while anarchy reigned, on the Nile and dry rot on the Bosphorus. The moment Egypt passed once more under a. single strong ruler Hejaz came obediently to heel the more readily for having experienced, during a decade of Wihabite supremacy, what it is to hanker after fiesh-pOts.It is only since the middle of the nineteenth century that this economic, ancl consequently political, bond has been somewhat relaxed. With the opening of the overland route ancl the frequentation of the lied Sea by steam craft, the Indian granary entered into more serious competition with the Egyptian than theretofore, and by 18.58 Indian traders had grown numerous enough at Jiddah to bring about our first armed intervention in Hejaz affairs. At the same time the Porte, seeing Egypt slipping ever more and more out of its control, initiated a policy designed to knit Hejaz and the other Arabian provinces directly to Constantinople a. policy which was to lead ultimately to the construction of the Hejaz railway. Symptoms of this policy were drastic interference in the succession of the Sherifate, the reigning house being dispossessed twice, in 1851 ancl 1880, by Ottoman mandate ; increase of the Hejaz garrisons ; energetic measures taken in regard to Yemen from 1870 onwards, and in regard to Hejaz by Othman Pasha in the eighties ; and, as important as any, Midhat&apos;s occupation of Hasa.
in 1871. This last step was only part of what was planned, for the subjugation of Nejd had been hoped for ; but even so, it gave the Turks command of the ports, including Koweit, by which Iraq supplies enter central Arabia. Thus established more firmly on both sides of the Arabian peninsula, Turkey made tentative efforts to compete with Egypt in the supplying of Hejaz. The caravan track from Damascus was garrisoned more efficiently, and surra to the tribes along it &quot;was increased and regularly paid. With the opening of the Suez Canal, the way lay open for steamers, mostly manned by Anatolian Greeks, but sailing under the Turkish flag, to transport the products of Anatolia and Syria to Red Sea ports ; and, by an understanding arrived at with the Emir Mohammed ibn Rashid in the eighties, caravan traffic from Iraq and the Gulf, via Hail or Qasim, to Hejaz was encouraged. In 1903 the Hejaz railway was begun ; by 1908 it was complete to Medina ; and in two years more, bttt for difficulties of terrain, reinforced by strenuous opposition from the Harb, whom the Grand Sherif was covertly supporting, it would have reached Mecca, and continued on its way towards Qunfudah and the Yemen.Such Ottoman measures, however, have had but little effect. Mecca is still nearly 300 miles from railhead by difficult and dangerous roads, and consignments to Medina from the productive Syrian area compete, in cost, with those from Egypt and the Sudan no better than consignments from Iraq compete in speed of transit. Transport even by sea from the Levant is at a, great disadvantage with that from Suez and Port Sudan by reason of greater coal consumption and the burden of Canal dues. The only possible rival of Egypt in the Jiddah food market is India, handicapped by distance, if till the last two years somewhat favoured by rail and port facilities. Moreover, at best, she can be an economic rival only, not a political one.We have changed the political status of Hejaz, but neither we, nor any others, have changed its economic status. Someone outside must still pay for its government and provide its food. If the former need is arranged for we may be easy about the latter. Egypt, the Sudan and India, will meet it in the future as in the past. But who shall finance Hejaz ? Even if the new Kingdom should be stretched to include some considerable part of Syria, it could not expect to get its expenses of administration out of that country. Syria is rich only by a moderate standard, and for long enough to come it will need for itself every piastre it can raise. In the still less probable event of Iraq joining up with Hejaz, it will be in scarcely better position, to help. It has its own ruined house to set in order.This being so, there remain some four possible alternative sources  of the necessary financial grants-in-aid.    (1) Efkaf properties ?   This means has actually been put forward as a practical proposition.   But most of the richer vahufs are situated
iii what, iu all likelihood, will still he Turkey after this war, and valcufs have first charges on them for the upkeep of mosques, schools, medresschs, fountains and what not. Moreover the sum required by a free Kingdom of Hejaz will be much in excess of the total of the Ottoman surra allowances, which used to be charged on efkaf properties in Turke)- sequestered by Mahmud IT. (2) &apos;&quot; Peter&apos;s Pence &quot; from the Faithful all over the Avorld ? Well one would be sorry to be King Husein&apos;s Chancellor of the Exchequer, introducing a Budget framed on estimated receipts from that source ! (3) Christian Powers ? If any of these should finance the Kingdom of Hejaz openly and directly, when there is no longer war for an excuse, that kingdom will fall into such discredit in Moslem eyes that it will cease to be worth financing at all. (4) Some external Moslem state or states ? Which of these can be conceived able and willing after the settlement of the present war? Certainly none of those that will preserve independence. And of the others is there any but Egypt that could do it ? The argument, therefore, leads us back to something not unlike, in fact, the status quo ante 1850, by whatever name it shall come to be called in, say, 1918.D.G.H.IDRISI&apos;S OFFENSIVE.In our issue, No. til, p. 365, we printed a statement about agreements reported by Idrisi to have been made between him and certain Yemen elements, including Hashid and Bekil tribesmen, for a combined offensive, ostensibly against the Turkish garrisons in the Yemenite Tihamah and northern highlands. Idrisi proceeded to ask for the subsidy and supplies which had been promised to him by us in the event of his enlisting the Hashid and Bekil. After some demur, due to the difficult)&apos; of verifying Idrisi&apos;s statements and of devising guarantees that his objectives should be such as would serve the purpose of the Allies, H.M. Government decided to fulfil its part of the pact ; and, on October 17, Aden sent Major B. R. Reilly, Assistant Resident, up to Jeizan with the total sum allocated by H.M.G., and instructions to interview Idrisi. if satisfied with his statements and plans and assured that he would accept a British liaison officer to accompany his operations, Major Reilly was to hand over the money. Food supplies were to follow. On October 21, Major Reilly telegraphed from Jeizan that his interview had been satisfactory except in respect of the acceptance of a liaison officer. To this Idrisi firmly objected, pleading that it would indispose his tribesmen to him. Nevertheless, it was decided that the whole sum of money, rather than, as had been suggested, an instalment, should be handed to him, he being told that no more
would be forthcoming for six months. He fully accepted our formula of policy ; but how far he will, or can, act up to it remains to be seen. The offensive must await the arrival of arms and supplies, the assembling of [drisfs own tribesmen, and the enlistment of others, e.g., Hashid, in numbers which we cannot, at present, forecast.Our own course has been guided rather by a sense of honourable obligation than by sure and certain hope of decisive action by Idrisi against the Turks. It is not intended that his offensive should be directed against the Imam Yahya, unless the latter should choose to send forces to fight side by side with Turkish troops. Nor, since Hashid and Bekil tribesmen, and many leading Zeidis, are among IdrisPs proposed allies, can the offensive be regarded as a threat to the prevailing creed of the Yemen highlands. Should Idrisi, as he professes to desire, advance primarily against the Turkish garrisons of northern Yemen, his operations will be almost entirely in the Tihamah, and he will hardly touch Zeidi country at all. Still less will he do so, if he should attempt to round up the Turks in Asir itself. We are under no obligations to the Imam Yahya; but we bear him no malice for a pro-Turk attitude, which he has been in no good position to avoid or change ; and it is our policy to support, rather than weaken the Zeidi Imamate, as an engine of government. Whenever we shall have settled accounts with the Turks ourselves, by expelling them with our own arms from Lahej and the Aden hinterland generally the only action which can possibly decide the south-west Arabian issue in our favour  we expect the Iinamate to range itself without rancour on our side, and to resume commercial relations with Aden.ARABIA. North-West.Intelligence.Sheri.fi.al Forces.There is almost nothing of importance to report about the Sherifial forces, although certain plans are ready, and the means to realize them have been organized and got under way. The sanitary condition of Akaba having improved, (no fresh case of paracholera, which the disease is now. stated to be, for five days up to November 6 and no case under suspicion), Sherif Zeid and his force of some 2,000 men are being transported from Wejh and Yambo to Akaba. Arabs, guarding the Qasim road for Sherif Abdullah, are stated to have seized a convoy of 380 sheep and 265 camels (whether laden or not is left uncertain) on its way from Nejd to Medina. Some fresh engagement between Turks and Arabs has taken place in Wadi Musa, and an Arab success is rumoured, but, as yet, not confirmed.
We have had no indication of any fresh interruption of the railway or of telegraphic communication during the week. . The Turks, for their part, have been redistributing their L. of C. troops on a more systematic plan, the chief changes involving strengthening of the garrison in the Hish-Aneiza district, strength en i no&apos; of machine-ffun sections and establishment of some additional intermediate posts, e.i/., between Hill Post Four and Bir Hurmas. The 161st Regiment has made another appear -ance in this area, its 2nd battalion now having its H.Q. at Demirbash and the duty of guarding the Hish light railway and forest. The strength of the 2nd Composite Force is reported officially at the end of October to be 1,722 rifles on the battle front. This total includes 2/152nd Regiment which has been reduced to 197 rifles only. Reports, which we are not able to confirm, have come to us, via Mecca, that Fakhri Pasha has declared Medina in a state of siege, and has commandeered all dates and stopped all supplies of cooked food. Also he is said to have withdrawn to Medina all L. of C. troops from Hadiyah and south of it, while those north of that point have been concentrated at Medain Salih. The capture and consolidation of Bir Saba by our troops will render communications between the E.E.F. and Feisabs army more eas)&apos; and secure and it should now be possible to open up a route via Tafileh to Kerak.Sherifial Mission to Sinai.Bir Saba affects also the mission of Sherif Abdullah ibn Hamza to the Sinai Bedouins, which was arranged, in concert with King Husein, and sent out, via Auja, to Asluj about the middle of last month. Tt seems now hardly worth while to maintain such a mission. The patent fact that Bir Saba, the administrative centre for these Bedouins, has passed under our power will be of far greater avail in Sinai than Sherifial propaganda. The emissary, therefore, will be withdrawn shortly.Prisoners Information.A Cadet officer of the 2nd Camel Battalion, captured in the Bir esh-Shediyah raid (see p. 412), states that Lieut.-Col. Kemal Bey, C.O.S., with A.C., with two or three staff officers, was on the train. It was doubtless one of this party who leaned out of a window and fell, back again on receiving the pointblank fire of a Bedouin. Being in the hinder part of the train, Avhich ran backwards down the gradient, these staff officers were not captured. The cadet officers account of the contents of the train is fairly accurate ; but either designedly or ignorantly he has mistaken the locality of the affair, and reports it to have taken place south of Akabat el-Hejazia. He states that a reserve of wood fuel is kept at Maan for military emergencies only.
NOTES.Hejaz Railway, Abu Naam to Bowat.Our railway route report is so deficient in detail south of el-Ala, that all and any information about the track thence to Medina is welcome. Lieut. N. W. Clayton, M.C., who has been attached till lately to Sherif Abdullah&apos;s. army, has visited the line on various occasions between the Wadi Hamdh bridge, just north of Abu Naam station, and a, point north, but within sight, of Bowat a stretch of about seventy-one kilometres, or rather under forty-five miles.    He sends, under date October ,9, some notes.The main bridge crosses Wadi Hamdh, which has been ascending parallel with the line from Jedahah, about one and a quarter miles north of Abu Naam. This bridge is of solid masonry with fourteen arches, twelve to fifteen feet in height. Just north of it, where the mountains come down close to the rails on the east, is a Turkish post with entrenchments, sanyars, and sand-bagged huts. South of it the line passes over three culverts, the first of three arches, the second of four and the third of three (square-topped), before reaching Abu Naam, where a fresh block of hills, behind which Wadi Hamdh bears away from the track, approaches on the east. The line makes a considerable south-westward curve between the main bridge and the station.From Abu Naam the south-westward direction is maintained -for some two and a half miles to a point known as el-Magrah, whence the line turns south along the bottom of a shallow valley averaging seven to eight miles in breadth. The slope on either hand towards the distant hills is very gradual hut steepest on the east. The level is broken only by a few stony undulations a few feet high, until after Stabl Antar station is passed. Just south of this point the foothills of Jebel Antar on the west approach within two miles and are continued to the line by a succession of isolated stony kopjes, on one of which is a Turkish post.The valley then opens out both east and west, but most on the west, into the plain of Jurf Lankomi, in the south-west of which, under the flank of Jebel Akrad, lies the Teitad oasis. The line runs on due south descending gradually to Bueir, the most important of the stations hereabout. North of the station, about 250 yards away, are a culvert and a Turkish post ; and barracks and tanks succeed on the left hand till the station is reached, it has a sand-bagged pumping-station, some sheds and a house for the O.C. all joined up by trenches. Water carried from here supplies the underground reservoirs of Stabl Antar, Bir Nasif, and Bowat.Continuing from Bueir the railway runs on south over very flat and open country for about nine miles. Then hills close in both east and west and the line has to traverse a harrow pass and descend by a corkscrew curve to the Wadi Hamdh again, which
slants in from north-east. A gorge called Kiiwei el-Hasak runs into the pass from the south and is held by a Turkish post. Another post guards the northern mouth of the pass. Bir Nasif station lies about five miles farther on the left bank of the Wadi Hamclh. it was not actually seen by Lieut. Clayton, who could only get a general view tip and down from a point a little beyond it to the south. The line continues along the left bank of the Wadi Hamdh, risinsr jjraduallv to Bowat station. There are scrub vegetation and some well grown trees in the wadi ; but more than that Lieut. Clayton could not see. He states that in the hills along this stretch of the railway, especially near Stabl Antar, there is a surpi ising amount of water, which, if Abdullah&apos;s Arabs were more enterprising and disciplined, would make the establishment of bases within raiding distance quite easy.Shehab Family.The news that two young officers from Hasbeya, of the Moslem branch of the Shchab family, who were taken prisoners at Beersheba, wish to throw in their lot with the Arab Cause (they state that they have long been members of a Secret anti-Turk Committee), recalls memories of a time when the Shehabs, led by the famous Emir Beshir of the Lebanon, were our very good allies. That was in the days of Sir Sidney Smith, Ibrahim Pasha, and the siege of Acre, nearly eighty years ago. But, while we welcome these recruits to the Arab Cause, we must not imagine that they will bring in with them any important Lebanon or anti-Lebanon elements. . The Shehabs, both Moslem and Maronite, are a ruined family without influence now-a-days; and the Moslem part of it has been in Turkish service for some generations, occupying minor administrative and clerical posts. As the &quot;Syrian Personalities&quot; volume will show, some of its members have been put by the Arab Committees on their &quot; Black List.&quot;

ARABIA.North-West.Intelligence.Wadi Musa Operations.Lt.-Col. Joyce has sent us at last Malud Effendi&apos;s account of the battle at Elji oh October 21 (see p. 427). it conflicts, needless to say, with the enemy account, which stated Arab casualties at a figure nearly equal to the whole Arab force really engaged, and multiplied its strength sixfold. The Arab defenders nnmbered about 350 &quot; regulars,&quot; made up of two companies Camel Corps and two Mule M.I., with two quick-firing mountain guns and four machine guns. As auxiliaries they had sixty Hudheil under Sherif Abd el-Mu&apos;in and 120 local jNaimat Arabs. The whole Arab force, therefore, was a little over 500 strong. The enemy, estimated at four battalions infantry (probably under strength), one regiment cavalry, and one company M.I. with six quick-firing mountain guns, two quick-firing field guns and two old ditto, attacked in.three columns from Hish, Maan and Ain Busta, assisted by an aeroplane which flew out twice from Maan and bombed the position. After heavy bombardment, the Turks captured the outer works, the Bedouin auxiliaries retiring to hills south of Elji, while the Mule M.I. held on to the hills on the north, and subjected the Turks, attacking from east, to a. cross fire. Only one small party of the latter got clown into the wadi aiid was soon expelled. What the Arab Camel Corps did is not stated, but may be guessed from Jaafar&apos;s strictures (see below). Towards evening the Bedouins worked round from the south to the Turkish left flank and forced a retirement, capturing twenty men ; and after dark, by harrying the retreat, they took also four-teen, men of the Medical Corps with twenty camels and ten mules. The Turks, who had to abandon some of their wounded, lost sixty killed, while Arab casualties are reported to have been forty all told : they had a mountain gun and a machine gun put out of action, the latter by a direct hit from the aeroplane. The defenders afterwards reoccupied all positions. Jaafar, in his comments, speaks well of the Mule M.I. but not of the Camel Corps, with certain of whose officers he is dealing summarily. Since this battle the Wadi Musa garrison has been increased to 800 infantry with two mountain guns and four machine guns, while the mounted troops are to be withdrawn to Akaba to be reorganized. The news of a subsequent Turkish attack on Wadi Musa, mentioned on p. 443, proves to have been a belated reference to the battle of October 21.Rumour, at pi*esent unconfirmed, reports that Audah abu Tayyi and his Huweitat are attacking the Shobak-Hish district and the railway about Aneiza.
Railway Raids.(a) Northern Section. Mursuq et-Teheimi, with whom was vSheikh Mutlukh abu Jemian of the Beni Atiyah and some 400 tribesmen, has reported on the Hill Post Four affair of October 18-20 (see p. 426.). He says his men attacked and captured not only this post, together with two patrols coming from north and south respectively, but, previously, a post north of Wadi Ethil, held by twenty men ; here they cut 650 (?) rails at kil. 710, isolated a relief train coming up from Tebuk, and wiped out a body of forty to fifty Circassian cavalry sent from the same place, who put up a stout resistance ; also they attacked a post of seventy Turks camped on the line between el-Hadhm and Mahtab, who offered little opposition and were all killed or captured, as was another party of seventy sent out from Tebuk. Altogether the two Sheikhs claim to have taken over 250 prisoners and killed 300 ; but though Lieut.-Col. Joyce thinks these totals not very far above the mark, the Sheikhs&apos; own premisses and enemy accounts argue that, all told, the enemy losses did not exceed, say, 250. It remains, however, a very creditable and useful performance on the part of unassisted Bedouins.In spite of recent reinforcement, the enemy reports that this section of the line is still very vulnerable, the 2nd Composite Force having a very large proportion of sick and useless men. There has been some damage done to the railway about November 5 between Bir Hurmas and el-Hadhm, but it seems to have been quickly repaired. On November 9, a fairly strong force of Arabs, divided into three parties, was operating at kil. 603, between that el-Haj and Harret el-Amara. They held up a patrol under an officer until reinforcement arrived from the former station, and then they retired, having, presumably, inflicted losses on the patrol. One of the Maan planes, flying towards that el-Haj, was put out of action by its motor overheating from lack of water, and it is doubtful if it can be repaired.On November 11, a bridge near Khirbet es-Sumra, north of Amman, was blown up as a two-engined train, containing &quot; Kuchuk &quot; Jemal Pasha, G.O.C. VIIIth  Army, his staff, some soldiers and Labour Corps, was passing over it. The Pasha was not hurt, but his A.D.C. and some twenty others were killed. The two engines were derailed, and, presumably, the bridge was wrecked.General.According to information given, on November 1, by Aziz Effendi, lately returned from the vicinity of the southern section of the railway, the Anazeh now holding Teima are 1,000 Wuld Suleiman tribesmen under Sheikh Mashan el-Awaji ; with them are 400 Ageyl, from King Husein&apos;s army, under Sheikh Shlash, a Shammar tribesman. Ibn Bashid has moved his camp three hours eastward from Medain Salih, fearing attacks from railway raiders,
but he remains absolutely debarred from Teima or Hail. His relations with the Turks continue strained, and special convoys of supplies are no longer sent to him. He. has to get what he can from the ordinary stores of the 58th Diy. at Medain Salih.The enemy has used the recent respite from railway raids to push considerable fresh supplies to Medina. The Military Coinmissaire General himself lias gone down the line from Damascus to Tebuk and Medain Salih and concerted measures for a more reliable train service, proposing even that Cardiff coal, of which he says Germany sends Turkey 400 tons daily, should be supplied to Maan. The Medina aeroplane which recently bombed the Arabs, inflicting three fatal casualties, is reported crashed near Bir Nasif and removed to its base a Avreck with petrol-tank pierced by rifle fire. There is such a shortage of benzine now in Syria, that none is to be sent down the line for some months to come and we are unlikely to hear much more of enemy planes in Hejaz. The ration strength of the H.E.F. is stated to he at this moment, in round figures, 14,000 with 100 guns, forty-one of these being machine guns. It has 18,424 rifles, and 3,515 transport animals. The rolling stock available on the railway for its use is computed at twenty locomotives and 100 trucks. In view of the possible fall of Jerusalem, the question of evacuating Medina, and the L. of C. is causing grave concern to the Turkish Hiffher Command.Sherif Zeid with .1,500 followers has arrived at Akaba,, from which all quarantine restrictions have been removed till further orders.[Late News. Sherif Abdullah&apos;s parties were operating on the railway, between Stabl Antar and Bo wait, on November 10-12, but we have no detailed report of their achievements. About the affair near that el-Haj on November 9, we have received further information which indicates that the Arabs made some captures. It is proposed to reinforce 2nd Composite Force at once by bringing up Camel Corps from Medina, and Mule M.I.. from el-Ala, both to march by road.]MESOPOTAMIA.The Diipaniyah Episode.The following- account of an episode, which has hitherto remainded obscure, reaches us from the Chief Political Officer, Baghdad, and, though the events, which it relates, belong to military operations somewhat outside the sphere of this bulletin, we publish it here for its singular interest as fin illustration of racial character.
&quot; The operations on the Tigris which led to the fall of Baghdad were so rapidly executed that the Turks had barely time to withdraw the small body of troops which held the distant post of Samawah on the lower reaches oF the Euphrates. After the capture of Kut, Ahmed Bey, who was in command at Samawah, hurried northward. As he passed Diwaniyah he left behind him, under charge of the garrison, consisting of a single, gendarmerie battalion, a parly of sick, together with their gendarmerie escort, from Samawah. On the fall of Baghdad most of the Ottoman officials at Diwaniyah evacuated the town, after distributing arms among the inhabitants and the local Shabnnah to enable the place to protect itself if necessary against the tribes. As forsthc gendarmerie battalion, a difference of opinion appears to have arisen within its ranks as to the right course of action. A second lieutenant, a Circassian, by name Mohammed Hachiin Farrnkh, held,according to his own account, that they should remain until the Turks could relieve them, and on the ground that those, who.wished to withdraw were traitors, he caused the Commanding Officer to be hanged and he shot with his own hand two other-officers. Nevertheless, the greater part of the battalion left Diwaniyah and made its way north, and it is possible that Mohammed Effendi might have done the same if he had been aware that the British were already in occupation of Fallujah ; but no authentic account of the military situation reached him and he continued to expect the speedy return of the Turks. He was left with about sixty men, some of them Turks, the rest Russian Mohammedan subjects from the Caucasus who had been taken prisoners early in the war and had accepted service in the Sultan&apos;s army. They occupied a warehouse and an adjoining caravanserai on the bank of the Euphrates. It was an advantageous position, for the walls of the warehouse were stout and the rooms high, enabling the garrison to dominate the low buildings of the town which they could bomb at pleasure. A deep trench were cut by them down to the river bank to enable them to obtain their water-supply. Apart from Mohammed Effencli&apos;s force, there were a. Sanitary Corps not under his command and a few Turkish wounded in the Serai, a building in the middle of the town. The wounded men gave themselves up to us in the middle of July and the Sanitary Corps in the beginning of August.The townsfolk of Diwaniyah, fearing equally the tribes beyond their gates and the Turkish garrison entrenched within their limits, begged early in May that a representative of the British Government might be appointed to them, and the administration be taken over by us. In the middle of May a number oF the principal tribal sheikhs of the district came in to Baghdad to pay their respects, and being informed that, a, Government representative could not be sent them until they had expelled their guests, they undertook on then&quot; return to Diwaniyah to put an end to Mohammed Effendi&apos;s resistance. This, however, proved to be a more difficult matter than they
anticipated. Mohammed Effendi defended himself with such success that his opponents gave up the attempt to dislodge him and declared that they could do nothing against him without guns.Early in June Salih Effendi Milli, an Arab resident of Baghdad who had been Mutessarif of Diwaniyah some years ago under the Turks, was appointed A.P.O. As long, however, as Mohammed Effendi held out it was not feasible for Salih to take up his duties at Diwaniyah ; he therefore remained at Dagharah until the atmosphere cleared. In reply to a communication which he sent at this time to Mohammed Effendi, calling upon him to surrender, the latter demanded that he and his men should be allowed to return with their arms to the Turkish forces and be given a sum of money to cover the expenses of the journey.Meantime an assurance had been obtained from the Russian -Military Authorities that any Russian subjects in Yuzbashi Mohaniiued&apos;s detachment should, on surrender, be guaranteed against punishment for bearing arms with the Turks. This promise was conveyed to Mohammed Effendi through the A.P.O. at Hillah (a British Officer) by the hand of an Arab officer -of Shabanah ; but Mohammed Effencli refused to surrender except to British soldiers, on the plea that the Shabanah officer would not be able to protect him from the vengeance of the tribes who had suffered losses during the course of the hostilities.The position was increasingly unsatisfactory. There Avas a universal desire in the town and district that Mohammed Effendi should be removed. Local politicians were unable to understand why so small a force should not be dealt with summarily by ourselves, and drew from the circumstance conclusions un-favourable to us. His presence was a source of irritation and disturbance in the town and among the tribes, who were growing more and more restless, and it not only delayed the arrival of Salih Effendi, who, as above explained, had to remain at Dagharah, but also prevented the effective assumption of control of the Hillah Diwaniyah road by the Hillah Shabanah police, so that trade was at a standstill and a general feeling of uncertainty and unrest prevailed.in July the General Staff wrote to Mohammed Effendi intimating that we were prepared to send a British escort to take his surrender, but Mohammed still maintained his refusal to surrender except, to force majeure in the shape of regular troops, and although desertions among his Turkish followers has reduced his numbers to some thirty-three men, his attitude became more confident, as well as more truculent, with the lapse of time. He now no longer thought it necessary to remain within the walls of his warehouse, but appeared openly in the streets of the town. The population lived in terror of the bombs which Tie did not hesitate to use if they showed any
opposition to his orders. Provisions lie obtained by bartering military stores with which he was well supplied. Early in August he tried to open negotiations with the powerful sheikhs of the Ehazahl, doubtless in the hope that they could be induced to give him a safe conduct to Ajeimi&apos;s camp ; but the KhazaMl sheikhs, who have suffered bitterly for the last twenty years at the hands of the Ottoman government and are perhaps more consistently anti-Turkish than any other tribesmen on the Euphrates, handed the letter to the Civil Commissioner.It was undesirable to allow this state of affairs to continue. On August 27, a couple of aeroplanes were sent to bomb MohamniecVs detachment, and though no casualties were caused, the effect was prompt. lie and his men, numbering twenty-eight, forthwith surrendered on. August 29, to the officials of the town. Salih Effendi appeared on the scene on. the following day, was received with acclamation as British representative and sent up the prisoners to Hillah whence they were conveyed to Baghdad.Mohammed Effendi, a fine upstanding man about forty years of age, stated that Ids prolonged resistance was due to the fact that he had constantly received news of Turkish successes from casual Arab informants and was under the impression that he was certain to be relieved. Moreover he held it to be beneath his dignity to surrender to townsmen or tribesmen and was doubt-less confirmed in this view by his fear lest they should exact retribution from him for the casualties for which he had been responsible. The British aeroplanes, however,convinced him that Ave Avere determined to put an end to the business and were in a position to carry out this resolve, and he lost no time in giving himself up. Me put the final touch of coined)&apos; to the whole episode by offering to serve either ourselves or the Sherif in any capacity. He said, (though his reasoning will scarcely be accepted by ethnologists) that as a. Circassian he was of good Arab descent and traced his lineage to the Quraish, a, circumstance which made him the more willing to carry his sword to the Sherif. He observed, that, in any case, lie woidd be likely to fare ill at Turkish hands, since it was improbable that the relations of the Turkish officers whom he had shot would accept his plea of military duty in full atonement for his action. His offer was not accepted and lie has been treated like any other prisoner of war and sent to India and his remarkable career as a. fighting man has been brought temporarily to a, close. It may be noted that he was with the Turkish troops when the)&apos; attacked Kerbela. in 1916. He has a wile and children at Ismid and married another wife, an Arab girl, while he was at Sainawah. She, with her immediate relations, was with Mohammed at Diwaniyah, and he was anxious to he allower! to take her to India.&quot;
Affairs at Kerbela. -The Chief Political Officer, Baghdad, scuds the following statement of the situation at Kerbela in September last.&quot;Itwill be remembered that the town of Kerbela has suffered at the hands of the Turks more acutely than any other part of the Iraq during the course of the war. In May 1915, a month after the battle of Shidaibah, the Ottoman Government made an ineffectual effort to re-establish its somewhat relaxed authority in the two holy cities, on the plea that they were harbouring deserters. On that occasion the brunt of the attack was borne by Nejef ; but Kerbela also succeeded in gaining a. partial independence. The townsmen were led by a local sheikhly family, the Beit Kamunah, represented by two brothers Mohammed, Ali and Fakhri ed-Din, who arc men of very considerable wealth and influence. They arc related to the ruling house of Persia, their grandmother having been a daughter of bath Ah Shah. But the position of Iverbela was still very precarious ; for, though it was for the moment united against the Turks, it was threatened by the jealousy of the big tribal sheikhs of the neighbourhood, especially the Beni Hasan under the two brothers U in van and Alwan, sons of Saadun, who might at any time join the Turks in an active offensive.Accordingly, in October 1915, Mohammed Ali entered into communication with Sir Percy Cox, then at Kut. and after a. preliminary exchange of letters, proposed lliat we should undertake lo make him hereditary and autonomous ruler of a sacred province extending from Samarra to Nejef. We were at the time, engaged in the advance which preceded the battle of Ctesiphon, and it seemed probable that we might shortly be in close touch with Kerbela. The C.P.O. sent Mohammed Ali a friendly but colourless answer together with a small present in money for which he expressed effusive gratitude. There for Hie time the matter dropped, our withdrawal from Ctesiphon having changed the political outlook. We remained, however, in communication with Mohammed Ali and from time to time sent him money to assist him in retaining his adherents and maintaining his position at Kerbela.In April 19.1.(! the Turks made a, second and more determined effort to subdue: Kerbela. Accusing fakhri ed-Din of having stirred up the Yasar sheikhs to aid the townsmen against the Beni Hasan, they surrounded his house and arrested him. Thereupon the town rose and after a, sharp contest drove out the Turks and established an administration under the Kaiiiunali brothers. Mohammed Ali, who continued to be in communication with ourselves, repeatedly expressed his fear of the return of the Turks and begged for assistance against them. The well-grounded anxiety of the holy towns continued until the fall of Baghdad. A few days after that event Mohammed Ali came in to see the C.P.O. and after a short stay in Baghdad returned home with a
mandate to maintain order until such time as it was possible for us to deal specifically with Kerbela affairs.Short of the appointment of a British officer with an adequate personal guard, a course which at the time was not feasible on military grounds, this was the only practicable alternative ; but before many weeks had passed it became evident that the arrange-ment was not wholly satisfactory to the town. The Kamunah Zadah were said to be using their privileged position to pursue their own schemes, and a growing dissatisfaction was apparent among the other town sheikhs, chief among them the Awwad family, represented by Abdul Kerim el-Awwad, a man much more typically Arab than the Kamunah. He would possibly have more influence in the town than they, but for the disadvantage that he is poor. Although the Kamunah were no doubt making-hay during a period of sunshine, there does not appear to have been much justification for serious complaint, and on the whole Mohammed Ali ran the administration Avell and kept the town quiet. But from the point, of view of the British authorities there was a more serious grievance against the brothers. A brisk traffic in supplies with the enemy was started from Kerbela,. Large caravans were reported to have come both from Damascus and Aleppo to seek foodstuffs, and the Turkish force on the Euphrates received constant supplies. The men of the Kubeisah oasis took a lively part in these enterprises. While Fahad Bey ibn Hadhdhal was at Baghdad in June, a. large Syrian caravan arrived on the outskirts of Kerbela and began openly to load up. Fahad Bey at our request sent word to his son, Mahrut, to. stop these proceedings ; the goods which had already been purchased were seized and brought in to his estate at Ghazazah. The owners were finally obliged to sell them and depart empty. After Fahad Bey&apos;s agreement with us the transmission of goods by way of the desert was to some extent stopped, but with the connivance of the Kamunah the trade continued furtively along the Euphrates, through Mas&apos;ud and Jannabiyin country, where Fahad Bey had not yet established control.It was impossible that - the Kamunah Zadah could be ignorant of what was going on. There was indeed abundant evidence to the contrary. Of Mohammed Ali the best that could be said was that he passively connived in the traffic, while Fakhri was an active participant. The town police, whom Mohammed Ali, as representative of the Government, had in his employment, were used to escort safely out of the town goods destined for the enemy, and two retainers of the Kamunah Zadah were accustomed to sign the necessary passes. Cloth, rice, wheat and coffee were the favourite exports. While the large profits to be derived from the levy of fees of jfel. and even  2 on each loaded camel were probably sufficient in themselves to explain the Kainunahs&apos; behaviour, it is also possible that they had come to realise that under British ride their grandiose personal ambitions stood small  chance of   materialising and
they were inclined to listen to the voice of the tempter. The Turks were undoubtedly carrying on extensive propaganda among the Euphrates tribes, coupled with promises of autonomy when the Iraq should be restored to the Porte. Humours of a rapprochement between Fakhri and the Beni Hasan sheikhs. Formerly so hostile to the town sheikhs of Kerbela, and of mm-municacions between him and Ajil ibn Samarmad, the powerful Sheikh of the Zubeid who has not yet made submission, were nor, reassuring. In any case, supply to the Turkish troops on the Euphrates could not be permitted to continue.On September 7, the Civil Commissioner summoned Fakhri to present himself at Baghdad on the 9th. He complied immediately, and on his arrival it was explained to him that his undoubted participation in and encouragement of trade with the enemy, had made his presence in Kerbela incompatible with military interests and that he would be sent to India, as an officer prisoner of war. He accepted with resignation a decision which , could scarcely have been unforeseen by him. The following da)&apos; Mohammed Ali also received a verbal summons from the Civil Commissioner, through the Intelligence Officer at Kerbefa, to come to Baghdad. He expressed himself willing to leave next morning, but subsequently, having received news of Fakhri&apos;s internment, he declined to go, though given hud/i wa hakht (assurance of personal safety) by the Intelligence Officer. The Civil Commissioner therefore despatched to him a, letter by the hand of the Nawab Mohammed Husein Qizilbash, an Indian subject and a well known inhabitant of Kerbela,, who has been, since the occupation, employed in the Political Office in Baghdad, explaining the reasons for the action taken with regard to Fakhri and adding that since, in view of what had happened, it was not considered in the interests of the administration that Mohammed Ali should continue to act, as Government Agent, a. British Officer had been appointed A.P.O. If Mohammed Ali under existing circumstances preferred to retire from Kerbela, the Government would make arrangements for his residence in comfort in some other place or town in the Iraq to be agreed upon.After some hesitation Mohammed Ali agreed to obey the original summons and come in to Baghdad. In this decision lie-was largely swayed by the advice of Sheikh Husein Mazandarani, the leading Mujtahid of Kerbela,, who urged him strongly not to disobey the orders of the Civil Commissioner, at the same time reminding him that the British Government, in no way resembled the Ottoman, and that promises of security given by us might safely be trusted. The part played by the leading Mnjtahid of Nejef, Seyyid Mohammed Kadhim Vazdi, who is the most revered of the Shiah Ulema of the Iraq, was not less satisfactory. In reply to an appeal from Mohammed Ali to intervene on behalf of Fakhri, he said that he had long since retired from the world;
if they wished for his opinion on the Word of God he was pre-pared to give it, but he would not express any view on affairs of state. Incidentally he observed that he had no intention of declaring a Jihad against aeroplanes and motors. He consented, however, to put in a plea that the office of Kiliddar, lately held by Fakhri, might not be removed from the family. For the present Mohammed Albs son, Hamid, has been left in charge.Mohammed Ali is now in Baghdad, staying with the Naqib, who, at the CCs request, kindly invited him to be his guest until a house could be got ready for him. Ultimately he will probably elect to take up his abode in Kadhimein. He arrived in time to see his brother Fakhri before the latter left for Basrah and India. By a curious coincidence Fakhri has as his companion on the voyage Mohammed Effcndi, the officer of gendarmerie who recently surrendered at Diwauiyah. The last occasion of their meeting wa,s in 1916, when Mohammed was with the Turkish troops which attacked Kerbela. The conjunction though entirely fortuitous is conducive to salutary reflections.Major Pulley is installed as A.P.O. at Kerbela and the town is perfectly quiet. According to private information volunteered by one of the Ulema of Kerbela, who has arrived at Baghdad, the religious heads of the Kerbela community are highly delighted with the removal of the Kanninah brothers, with whom, for the sake of their personal immunity from molestation, they have been obliged to keep on outwardly cordial terms, though the truculent Kamunah excesses and oppression have been a continual source of anxiety. The support, which the authority of the Adminis-tration has had in this matter from the leading Mujtahids, both at Nejef and Kerbela, has been a, matter for extreme satisfaction.&quot;ABYSSINIA.We are still without news of. further developments at Adds Abeba later than what has already been reported (see p. 434) ; but more details of the causes which have led to the foreshadowed crisis have come to hand.The position of the Empress is not in question. Having once been crowned, she will probably remain on the throne for her lifetime. She cannot, however, as a woman, exercise personally the supreme power in Abyssinia and must content herself with acting through a representative who thus becomes the actual head of the Government. For the past year this position has been occupied by lias Taffari in his quality of Heir Apparent, and it is only of late that his right to this position has been in any way called in question, although the Council of Ministers have always
maintained that his decisions ought to be referred to them for sanction before being carried into effect. So long as Fitaurari Hapta Giorgis was at the capital all went smoothly enough ; but, on his departure and after the fall of Bituaded Haili Giorgis, the leadership of the council passed to Dejaz Igazu who at once began to intrigue with the Empress against Ras Taffari with the idea of getting all the power into his own hands. It was an easy matter for him to persuade the Empress that the Ras was exceeding his powers and was reducing her to the position of a mere puppet on the throne and, at the same time, to spread the rumour that Ras Taffari was selling his country to the Europeans, thereby creating a hostile atmosphere among the lesser officers and ignorant soldiery and preparing the way for a coup aV&amp;tat.The execution of the plot was timed for Mascal, the principal religious feast of the year, when the national and religious feelings of the population can most easily be stirred, and Dejaz Igazu counted on the support of his god-father, Ras Demisie, and of the Mahal Safari, the latter being a composite body of some 30,000 men made up of the imperial bodyguard and of all the servants, artizans and hangers-on in the palace, ancl dependent solely on the Emperor of the time. Ras Taffari, by ordering, as already reported, Ras Demisie to proceed at once to his country, by collecting in Adis Abeba 5,000 of his Harrar army, and by granting a district in the Arussi to the Mahal Safari, succeeded for the moment in disorganizing the plot and the feast of Mascal seems to have passed off quietly.The main point remains however untouched, and the question for the future is whether Ras . Taffari or Dejaz Igazu is to exercise the powers of government under the Empress. While it is probable that Ras Taffari must win in the end, there is no denying that Dejaz Igazu has for the moment many points in his favour. The Empress tacitly supports him, and his followers are concentrated in the Ghebi, while the adherents of&quot; the Ras, as well as his troops, are scattered in the town. Taffari himself, however, is obliged to live in the Ghebi ; if Dejaz Igazu, therefore, ever feels himself strong enough, it would be an easy matter to arrest and chain Taffari up before airy support could reach him. It is doubtful that Dejaz Igazu would dare to attempt such a stroke now that the strength of the rival parties is fairly evenly balanced, and probably no decision will be come to until Fitaurari Hapta Giorgis returns to Adis Abeba. If no incident occurs before then to precipitate a crisis, it is believed that the Ras intends to make the Fitaurari Bituaded and Prime Minister with full powers to re-organize the govern-ment ; and. the first step to this end would probably be the dissolution of&apos; the Council of Ministers a measure which would put an end to Dejaz Igazu&apos;s influence.
NOTES.Telcfit.The news of General Maude&apos;s capture of Tekrit, the birthplace of the great Saladin, is only less welcome than that of the occupation of Gaza and most of southern Palestine by General Allenby. Tekrit is the northern frontier town of the Baghdad district on the Mesopotamian bank of the Tigris and the last settlement of any importance on either bank for over 100 miles as one ascends the river. Beyond it, on the northward road, lies almost continuous steppe desert, with rare spring or well water, as far as Shura, the first real village, which is less than thirty miles south of Mosul. Qalah Sherghat, the ancient Asshur, where a German expedition has been excavating for nearly twenty years, lies over sixty miles above Tekrit. It has been developed by the Germano-Turk command into a considerable road-station, but, like all the Tekrit-Mosul road, it can be harried by the Jerba Shamihar from el-Hadr, and is surrounded by desert. We can now close the caravan track from Tekrit to Hit, which has been developed of late by the Turks, and they can only open another, and considerably longer one (over 100 miles) from Hit to Qalah Sherghat by conciliating or terrorising the Shammar. The Duleim, hitherto their allies, also range in these parts. Tekrit itself is a place of some 5,000 inhabitants, who live of. their. gardens and the profits of rafting trade downstream and the ferry to the left bank of the Tigris. They have numerous primitive river-craft. In the wars of the 11th to the 13th century armies often chose Tekrit as their point of passage.More about Shahturs.Later Intelligence Summaries from the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force supplement the information given on p. 422. It appears that Birejik is building shahturs in great numbers, though Jerablus is still the general assembling yard. They are towed back by man power, after finishing their trip, a deserter having seen forty a day being dragged up stream. On September 2, there were seventy-five pairs of ordinary shahturs in the yard at Jerablus, and also four designed to carry especially heavy weights. An agent, considered &quot; fairly reliable,&quot; states that he left Jerablus on September 2, in a convoy of twenty-five shahturs carrying 250 infantry, ammunition, supplies and entrenching tools. They reached Hit on September 19. Von Miicke is said to be now at Meskineh.
