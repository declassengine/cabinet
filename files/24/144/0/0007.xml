SECRET.5APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT No. XXXII.Russia.GREAT interest attaches to the telegrams received from Sir George Buchanan regarding the Moscow Conference and the future of the Government.Poland.The establishment of the National Polish Committee in Paris and the breakdown of the Polish Provisional State Council are both events of no little importance.Syria.The fall of Jemal Pasha is significant and important, and tends to show the power of Germany over internal Turkish affairs and over the Turkish army. On humane grounds one cannot but rejoice at the departure from Syria of such, a man as Jemal, but none the less the removal of the last Young Turk leader who dared to stand up against Enyer and the complete Germanization of the Turkish Empire, can but improve Turkish militar)?&quot; effectiveness south and east of Aleppo. It is not inconceivable that the departure of Jemal may be accompanied by a new policy vis-d-vis the Arabs and Jews. Jemafs policy with regard to these people was undoubtedly similar to Talaat&apos;s policy regarding Armenians. Berlin probably thought this policy a little too neo-Turanian for present purposes, and would welcome a milder treatment of the subject races pro tern., knowing, that in the event of Turkey retaining the Arab-speaking provinces at the end of the war, the full rigour of oppression and persecution can be applied afterwards. Whereas Jemal hung Arabs, starved Maronites, and deported Jews, Falkenhayn, or rather Kuhlmann, will probably try briberj^. The movement for freedom has become too strong to be scotched now, and Jemahs methods must be deferred until the piping times of European peace. We shall now watch with interest, but let us hope without illusions, for political as well as military developments south of the Taurus.   Jemals local name in Syria is &apos;: Jebbar&quot; (the butcher).Egypt.It is unfortunate that local conditions, and probably local prejudices, prevent the temporary sojourn of some of the Salonica Jews in the more immediate vicinity of Palestine.Turkey.The Agent&apos;s report regarding Turkish representations to Vienna&apos; against Turkish travellers being allowed to enter Switzerland is interesting. One would, not regret such an embargo, but the idea of it would seem more likely to have originated in Berlin than in Constantinople.[898-59]
Hejaz. ......-................King Hussein is an independent Sovereign, and we cannot be surprised if he accepts, as he is entitled to do, a subvention from another Government in return for a quid pro quo&apos; of which&quot; we have no knowledge. But, under the circumstances, it; would have been, far more satisfactory if, as we have borne the burden and heat of the day, we were in the full confidence of all concerned in these transactions, and not merely informed of the completed decisions of an Allied Government.W. 0.-G.September 7, 1917.1

Buchanan telegraphed on the 29th August &quot;1 [No. 1345] that at his request the assistant consul-general at Moscow had given his opinion of the conference, and it was to the following effect : (1.) There was no real evidence of any willingness to abandon party interests. (2.) Little was said about peace, but there seemed to be a strong undercurrent in favour of it on any acceptable terms. (3.) There seemed to be but little chance of improvement (as a result of the conference) in either the military or the internal situation. (4.) The Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s delegates did not applaud the speech of General Korniloff, who had returned to headquarters without having arranged his difficulties with M. Kerensky.Telegraphing again on the 30th and 31st August fNo. 1353 and 1360], Sir G. Buchanan said that opinions about the conference differed greatly. M. Kerensky himself seemed to be satisfied, and he spoke as if the Government had been strengthened. M. Tereschenko, too, expressed himself satisfied with the results. He said that though the views expressed differed considerably, all were agreed as to the necessity of mobilising all the national forces for the work of reconstruction and the continuance of the war. He admitted, however, that M. Kerensky had been nervous and had made mistakes in his speeches, and added that what had most put the audience against him was his autocratic manner. From other sources Sir G. Buchanan had heard that he had lost most of his popularity and prestige.Summing up, Sir G. Buchanan said that the result of the conference was, so far as he could judge, that the Government, if only it had the courage to do so, had now more or less full powers to act with firmness. The Soviet was on the defensive throughout, but M. Tseretelli had declared in his closing speech that, till the enemy[898-59] B
had been expelled from Russia, the war must be carried on^ that strict discipline must be enforced, and that a separate peace could only be conluded over &quot;the body of the revolution.&quot;Possibility of a Counter-Revolution. In the course of his telegram of the 31st August [No. 1360], Sir G. Buchanan said that M. Kerensky had told him that there was a group among the cadets working to overthrow the Government., and to promote a counter-revolution. Telegraphing on the following day [No. 1370] he said that M. Tereschenko had expressed a disbelief in any present danger of a counter-revolution, though there was a group among the cadets who might try to oust the Government and more especially himself. Sir G. Buchanan said that he himself could not help feeling that M. Kerensky was right, as from information which had reached him (Sir G. Buchanan) from various sources it seemed that there were many who thought that Russia could only be saved by a military coup oTEtat, he had even heard that an attempt of this kind was in contemplation.Sir G. Buchanan&apos;s information would appear to have had some foundation in fact, for on the 2nd September he telegraphed [No. 1371] saying that the press had reported that, as the result of information supplied by the Council of Workmen and Soldier Deputies to the Provisional Government, a series of arrests&apos; in Pelrograd, Moscow, and the provinces had been carried out, by order of the Minister for Justice, of persons alleged to be concerned in a counter-revolutionary plot. It was semi-officially stated that the Provisional Government did not consider it advisable at the present stage to publish the names of those arrested or details of the evidence obtained during the domiciliary searches which had been carried out. Energetic enquiries under the direct supervision of M. Kerensky were being prosecuted. It was stated that certain well-known public men and prominent military officers were involved. But telegraphing again [No. 1374] on the 3rd September he said that from what M. Tereschenko had told him that morning he gathered that the reports published in the press in regard to the arrest of counter-revolutionists were exaggerated. Only two or three persons appeared to have been arrested so far, though the existence of a plot had been ascertained as a fact by the judicial authorities at Galatz. The parties of the Right, M. Tereschenko remarked, had had so little experience of secret conspiracy that they were not likely to prove adepts in the organization of a counter-revolution.The Future of the Government. Telegraphing on the 30th August [No. 1353] Sir G. Buchanan said that the Government was only given two or three weeks longer life by some people; but he did not think the moment ripe for the only alternative, the dictatorship of General Korniloff, though the reaction was growing steadily. M. Kerensky, when the next crisis came, would, unless he showed real strength of character by his acts, have to give way to a stronger man ; he had rendered great services in the past, but he had played his part.General Korniloff.- Sir G. Buchanan telegraphing on the 30th August [No. 1353] that M. Tereschenko had informed him that the commander-in-chief had now full powers for dealing with the armies on the various fronts, and that he did not wish that the death penalty should be applied at once everywhere in the rear. General Korniloff had on two occasions had men shot on his own authority in the Moscow district ; and serious disorders having arisen at Kazan martial law had been proclaimed there. He admitted, however, that the situation was still very unsatisfactoiy, and though it would, he said, be risky to proclaim martial law in Petrograd measures would be taken to deal with it. Pie was anxious, he said, to correct the erroneous impression given by the press that there was friction between General Korniloff ancl M. Kerensky ; but in. spite of this Sir G. Buchanan said that there was no doubt that the latter was afraid of the general becoming all-powerful, and that he had heard on good authority that at the conference he had tried to prevent him from speaking, he seemed to have even taken elaborate precautions against a coup cVEtat.The Death Penalty. Speaking with M. Kerensky on the 31st August [No. 1360], Sir G. Buchanan asked him whether it was true that the death penalty was to be applied in the rear; and the Prime Minister replied that, as regarded the rear, it was proposed to apply the death penalty to all persons alike for certain offences, such as high treason. Telegraphing on the 1st September [No. 1370], be said that on the previous day a resolution protesting against-the death penalty had been passed by the Soviet with only four dissentients (one of whom was M. Tseretelli), but he had been Assured by M. Tereschenko that no attention would be paid to it.
The Railway Difficulty. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the. 31st August [No. 1360] that in the course of conversation with M. Kerensky he had recalled the statements made at the Moscow conference to the effect that there was a danger of the army being faced with famine in November through the breaking down of the railways, and had asked how he (M. Kerensky) viewed the situation. M. Kerensky admitted that it was very serious, and said that he could not prophesy or give an absolute guarantee as to the future. The Government was doing everything in its power to surmount the difficulties, and he could give an assurance of one thing : that unless it was materially incapable of continuing it, the Government would never withdraw from the war.Exchange of Prisoners of War with Austria. Lord Bertie telegraphed on the SOfch August [No. 845], with reference to Mr. Balfour s telegram of the 30th August [Eastern Report, XXXI p. 2], saying tha,t the French Ambassador in Petrograd had been instructed to support Sir G. Buchanan in the matter of the exchange of Austrian and Russian prisoners. And on the same day Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 1349] that he had been assured by M. Tereschenko that there was no question either of the exchange of able-bodied prisoners or of a neutral exchange zone. Before the receipt of the latter telegram Mr. Balfour had telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan [No. 1824] asking him to enquire into the truth of a statement made by a Swiss officer.recently returned from Vienna to the effect that the two Governments were in direct telegraphic com-munication in regard to the exchange and repatriation of prisoners of war, that frequent telegrams passed daily, and that negotiations were in progress for the passage of trains, at some point on the frontier. Sir G. Buchanan replied on the 1st September [No. 1366] that M. Tereschenko had informed him that there was not a word of truth in the statement that the two Governments were in telegraphic communication; negotiations respecting the exchange of invalided-&apos;prisoners were conducted exclusively at vStockholm.POLAND.Provisional State Council. Sir W. Townley telegraphed on the 31st August [No. 2713] that the Polish Provisional State Council had resigned in a body, according to Wolff, the ostensible reason being connected with the incorporation of the Polish Sharpshooter Legion in the Austro-Hungarian arury, but the real reason probably was the proposal put forward in the Central Committee of the Pteichstag for the autonomy of Courland and Lithuania. The fact that the proposal had been passed without a division proved that the German Government had decided to act in that direction. The resignation of the German-fathered State Council of Poland meant that there was now an open breach between Germany and those Poles who formerly favoured the German coup of November 1916.National Polish Committee. Mr. Balfour telegraphed on the 2nd September [No. 3513] to Sir C. Spring-Rice informing him of the constitution of a National Polish Committee, the seat &quot;of which was to be in Paris. His Majesty&apos;s Government was disposed to officially recognise this committee, but before taking action Mr. Balfour said that he should like to have the opinion of the United States Government, as Mr. Page had recently suggested that a Polish Provisional Government in the United States should be recognised. MM. Dmowski, Piltz, Seyda, Sobanski, Zamoyski, and Paderewski were members of the newly-formed committee, which proposed to undertake (1) the protection of Poles in the allied countries; (2) the representation of Polish interests in Great Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, and elsewhere if necessary; (3) the conduct of any political questions which might arise out of the recent constitution of a Polish army to fight on the side of the Allies.TURKEY.Prisoners of War. Mr. Balfour telegraphed a message for the Dutch Minister in Constantinople to Sir W. Townley on the 1st September [No. 2348]. He said that Ayoub Sabri&apos;s treatment was especially good, but His Majesty&apos;s Government would be compelled to reconsider this treatment if the Turkish Government persistently withheld permission to visit the camps of British prisoners of war and if it, the British Govern-ment, was not satisfied &apos; with their treatment. The offer made to send delegates to discuss with Turkish delegates in Switzerland Ayoub Sabri&apos;s exchange and other questions was still open,[898-59] , B 2
Jemal Pasha. An agent reports the arrival of Jemal Pasha in Berlin on the 27th August. Falkenhayn had insisted on his removal, and he was recalled to Constantinople. He went to Berlin in response to an autograph invitation from the Emperor, and was expected to remain some months in Germany; possibly his return to Turkey would not be permitted.Visitors to Switzerland.-An agent reports on good authority that orders have been given to .Vienna by Turkey that, until further notice, travellers from Turkey should not be allowed to go to Switzerland.EGYPT.Immigration of Salonika Jews. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 30th August [No. 909] requesting that Salonika Jews might be discouraged from going to Egypt, as the authorities there were greatly averse to their immigration. In consequence, .Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 1208] on the 1st September to Mr. Crackanthorpe requesting him to instruct the consul-general at Salonika in this sense.Ex-Khedive [Eastern Report XXVII, p. 3; XXIX, p. 4].-Sir PI. Rumbold telegraphed on the 29th August [No. 750] that he had learnt that Arif Pasha had arrived from Constantinople on the 21st August, bringing a satisfactory message from the Turkish Government in regard to the terms on which the Ex-Khedive would retilrn to Constantinople, which he had been sent to negotiate. In consequence the Ex-Khedive was about to leave Switzerland for Constantinople. This information came from a source which had hitherto proved absolutely reliable, but Sir H. Rumbold found it difficult to believe that the Ex-Khedive would put himself in the power of the Turks.CIRENAIQA.Turkish Prisoners of War [Eastern Report XXX, p. 4]. Sir R. Rodd telegraphed from Rome on the 26th August [No. 728] saying that a letter from Idris about the Turkish prisoners had been received by General Moccagatta who was acting as governor at Benghazi. Idris had stated that they were safely interned, from which it was deduced that he did not contemplate surrendering them. It was proposed by the Minister of the Colonies to instruct General Moccagatta to insist on the observance -of article 2 of the Talbot agreement. This was repeated to Cairo and on the following day Sir R. Winga.te replied [No. 901] saying that he believed that a peremptory communication would not accelerate but rather tend to delay the surrender of the prisoners. To keep his word with us Idrisi would probably wish (when the first excitement in connexion with the capture had subsided) to surrender them surreptitiously ; he would probably wish to advertise as little as possible the fact that he was handling over Moslems to Europeans. He, Sir Lt. Wingate, would suggest writing a congratulatory letter to Iclrisi, expressing therein a desire to meet his convenience in regard to the prisoners so far as was consistent Avith the agreements he had entered into, but asking him at the same time what steps he proposed to take to comply with the terms of the Talbot agreement. Mr. Balfour telegraphed on the 30th August [No 853] authorising him. to write on the lines he had suggested. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir R. Rodd on the same day [No. 1569] informing him that he had authorised Sir R. Wingate to write on these lines, and instructing him to approach the Italian Government suggesting that both Governments should ^approach Idris in this way.Sir R. Rodd had said that the Italian Minister of the Colonies had expressed a wish that the letter written by the High Commissioner should be sent to General Moccagatta to be by him forwarded to Idris, and Sir R. Wingate saw no objection to its being done in this case.On the 1st September Sir R. Rodd telegraphed [No. 742] that if Sir R. Wingates letter were sent to General Moccagatta, the latter would be instructed to draft his own letter in similar terms the Ministry of the Colonies having agreed to the suggested terms -of the communication. On the 3rd September Mr. Balfour instructed Sir R. Wingate [No. 865] to act accordingly.Italian Customs Post in Danger. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 2nd September [No. 924] that a telephone message had just arrived to the effect&apos; that on the 28th August the Italian officer in charge of the new customs post at Amasit,
5-about 25 miles from Bardia, had informed the officer, commanding at Solum that the attitude of the local Arabs was threatening, and that an attack on the post was to be, apprehended. The agent of Mohammed Idris el Senoussi disclaimed responsibility for the safety of the post, which, he considered, had, been established contrary to the Italian agreement with Idris, but he (? was) endeavouring to induce the armed natives to retire from its vicinity. Sir R. Wingate went on to say that customs posts were, he thought, mentioned in the Italian agreement with Mohammed Idris el Senoussi, but the local Arabs would, hardly distinguish between them and military posts, and if Beuhazi had not. informed Idris of the intention to establish a new post we might expect difficulties. The Italian officer at Novamas had asked for military support in case of need, which must obviously be given at the risk of being drawn into a (? doubtful) dispute with Idris.ARABIA.Hejaz.Grant of Money from the French Government. Mr. Balfour telegraphed on the 30th August [No. 854] to Sir R* Wingate saying that he had been informed by the French charge d&apos;affaires that his Government had decided to make the King of Hejaz a special grant for military purposes. The grant would be the gold equivalent of 975,000 francs, which would be sent through M. Cherchali, who would explain to the King the details of the purposes for which it was intended. : the French Government asked permission to export in time to reach Hejaz by the loth (September. This amount of gold had been placed at the disposal of the French. Government by the Cairo branch of the Credit Lyonnais. Mr. Balfour felt that some quid pro quo must have been given or promised, and asked Sir R. Wingate whether he could throw any light on the matter:j4 Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 4th September [No. 931] that about three&quot;&apos; months ago permission was given to the Freach authorities to export gold up to 975,000 francs on condition that they should take it from the French banks, whose * holdings were of no assistance to us: but nothing- was known, either in Cairo or -(? Jeddah), of the suggestion to give that amount to King Hussein. Sir R. Wingate urged that the French Government should be asked to secure the money being given -either to the King or to the Emir Faisal, who was short of necessary funds, and required as much gold as possible. A refusal to allow the gold to be exported would -appear unreasonable to&apos;the French, and we should risk an untoward effect on Anglo-French relations in the Hejaz area.Asib.Idrisi. Sir A. Hirtzel wrote to the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs -on the 3rd September informing him that Mr. Montagu saw no objection to the authori-sation which Sir R. Wingate proposed to give Major Reilly, on the conditions specified in his telegram of the 23rd August [Eastern Report XXXI, p. 5]; but Mr. Montagu was unable to admit any part of the proposed expenditure as a charge *upon Indian revenues,% SYRIA.&apos;:&apos; Scheme of Provisioning the Province. Count de Salis, in a despatch dated the 19th August, enclosed a scheme for the provisioning of Syria which had resulted from the negotiations of Monsignor Dolci, delegate-apostolic at Constantinople, with the Ottoman Government. The scheme, which was approved by the latter on the 12th July, provided that this Government should protect and guarantee, provisions destined for necessitous Syrian civilians; that it should;remit all customs duties; and that it should facilitate transport as much as possible. Provisions brought in neutral vessels flying the pontifical flag would be &quot;distributed in the name of His Holiness. The central executive committee would consist of the delegate-apostolic for Syria (president), the procurator of the Holy Land (vice-president), and eight other members, of whom two would be appointed by the Ottoman Government from the municipality of Beirut and the other six would be priests chosen by the delegate-apostolic in Constantinople, without regard to nationality; whilst the local committees would consist, in each case, of the catholic rector of the place and two other priests, of any nationality, appointed by the delegate-apostolic for Syria. The stock of food, it was decided, should be entrusted to the charge of the Spanish consul or some one
nominated by him, and it should be the duty of the person so charged to distribute the-provisions as directed by the central committee and to take.the necessary steps for despatching them to their destinations.On the 1st September Count de Salis telegraphed [No. 45] that the delegate-apostolic afConstantinople had reported that the central committee was to include some British subjects, but the Vatican had no information in regard to them.INDIA.Emigration Conference. From a telegram sent by Mr. Long to the governors of certain colonies, it appears that the Indian Government has under consideration the recommendations of the Emigration Conference. The recommendations include the abolition of the indenture system ; a free system of aided colonisation, the immigrant not being restricted to service with any particular employer except, for his own pro-tection, during the first six months ; land settlement as an essential feature of the scheme; a minimum wage; a revision and improvement of the Indian arrangements for the supervision of intending emigrants; provision for the emigranfs family; provision for payment of part or whole of return passage money after at least three-years&apos; service, or under certain conditions at any time.AFGHANISTAN.The Army. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 1st September [No. 1369] that M. Tereschenko had informed him that the vice-consul at Birjaud had reported that the Amir had ordered that to strengthen the arnvy one man in every seven should be taken; and that recalcitrants were being threatened with force. The measure had. caused discontent, but already 1,000 horse had been sent in the direction of Seistan.. M. Tereschenko wished to know whether His Majesty&apos;s Government had received any confirmation of this.Viceroys Monthly Report. The Viceroy telegraphed on the 31st August in regard, to the internal situation&apos;that it was quiet and normal.LATEST  INFORMATION.RUSSIA.Arrest of Two Grand Dukes. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 4th September [No. 1381] that a statement had been published in the press to the effect that, in connection with the monarchist plot, the Grand Dukes Paul and Michael had been placed under domiciliary arrest.TURKEY.The C.L7.P.-Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed on the 4th September [No. 780] tha^ the unity of the Government and of the C.U.P. in general appeared to be much shaken^ Enver and Talaat having quarrelled.   It seemed that more than ever (with a view especially to the making of money) each prominent member was playing for hi&amp; own hand.CIRENAICA.The New Italian Post. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 6th September [No. 939] that the officer commanding the post had stated that he had no intention of collecting customs dues ; his orders were to check the passage of natives, but to take no-provocative action. The post, he said, had been formed without the knowledge of Idrif, who, had he been consulted, would probably have refused permission. Idris&apos;s agent had been informed that any hostile action against our Allies would involve a Breach with ourselves, and that no armed gathering could be allowed near our frontier : the agent was actively working to quiet the Arabs. Sir R. Wingate added that the main object of the new post was evidently political, and that the Italians were obviously out to establish a frontier line. Its establishment had greatly excited the local Arabs, and he considered that urgent representations should be made to the Italian Government..PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE  BY C.  R.

ARABIA.The Sherif s Religious Views.On July 28, 1917, the Sherif of: Mecca explained at some length to Colonel Wilson before me his dogmatic position. He began by sketching the original tenets of the Wahabi sect its puritanism, its literalism and its asceticism. After the Egyptian conquest of Nejd the sect fell away very quickly in numbers and enthusiasm, till of late years it was practically confined to Ariclh. The Nomads, Wushm and Qasim had all weakened so much as to be practically Sunni.About four years ago there was a sudden revival. The Sherif is doubtful as to whether this can be ascribed to Ibn Snucl or not. At any rate, funds were obtained from some-where, and Wahabite missionaries went up to Qasim, amongst the Ateiba, Meteir and Sbei, and into Mecca and Taif. The first tenet of the new preachers was that the orthodox Sminis and Shias (especially the Shias), were infidels. The Emir of Mecca was as convicted a Kafir as the Turks. The constructive side of the new creed was curious ; they preached an exaggerated fatalism : &quot; Cod does everything ; &quot; they forbade medicine to the sick, discouraged trade, building and forethought. A favourite saying was, &quot; If a. man fall into a well, leave it to God to pull him out.&quot;The missionaries were at first successful in great part, and the Sherif took alarm at the prospect. He sent Sidi Abdullah rapidly into Nejd, and by a show of force recovered the Ateiba, and most of the Meteir, and bound them again to the Emirate of Mecca. He also seems to have taken steps to counter-preach the new dogmas in Qasim itself, and in a short time the second Wahabite movement appeared to have spent itself. It was, however, only dormant, and in the last year or so missionaries have as;ain been issuing from Ariclh, and aoitatino- the neighbourhood.Ibn Saud has increased the unrest by his military policy. He has called out his levies two and three times in the year, discriminating between town and town ; from one he will demand a contribution of men ; and from another a composition in money. This has particularly annoyed Aneyza, Boreyda and Euss, rich and comfortable towns; fond of silk and tobacco, and not too fond of prayer. Their disaffection is wide, and the Sherif regards it as an embarrassment, since his ambitions extend to the limits of the Ateiba and Meteir 011I37, and be has no desire to be involved in any question of the suzerainty of the Qasim towns. At present there is a sharp cleavage between Aridh and Qasim, which any external encouragement, or 1111-wise internal act, might inflame into an open breach.We then asked the Sherif about the position of the Shias. Towards the Wahubis, he said, they were extremely hostile. Other than that, he could not see in them any particular policy.
They loved his family, since Shias have a greater respect for the person of the Prophet than have the Sunn is. Some such as the Zeidis ancl Jaafaris were, in his opinion, more reasonable in their attitude than the Shafeis who oppose them. The Hanefite objection to the Shias was political and not doctrinal.He, in common with all. orthodox Islam, was not prepared to deny the Khalifate of Abu Bekr, and regarded the Shias who condemned Abu Bekr, Omar and Othman, as mistaken. The Shias in India are largely heretical in their views, as are many of the Persian sects.(The Sherif is ostensibly a Shafei. In this conversation he took up a middle position between moderate Shia and Sunni ; it is generally believed that his real beliefs are Zeidi. Sidi Abdullah is nearly Openly a Shia of the Jaaferi wing ; Sidi Ali is a Sunni, and a fairly definite one ; Sidi Feisal is not a, formalist, and tends to an undefined undogmatic position, more Shia perhaps than Sunni, but vague. They are all nervous of betraying their real attitude, even to their friends, and maintain a non-committal Shafei profession in public.)I then mentioned to the Sherif that the Northern Arabs commonly called him Emir el-Muminin, and asked him if this title was correct and if it met with his approval. After a short reflection he said &quot;No&quot; and made his refusal more definite later. He said that people ascribed to him ambitions which he did not possess ; he had even heard talk of his reviving the Khalifate. He explained his position with regard to the Khalifate. It was the simple Shia one (already impressed on me by Feisal and Abdullah), namely, that the Khalifate expired with Abu Bekr, and that any resurrection of the idea to-day was not only grammatically absurd but blasphemous. He will have absolutely no truck with such a notion. (Siclj Abdullah is weaker than his father in this respect. If he saw profit from the Sunni side in the assumption, he might do it, and cut the loss of the Shia element; yet, as matters stand, if the decision lies with him it is improbable that it will ever be adopted.) The idea of a Moslem Khalifate was, said the Sherif, suggested to Abdul IIamid by the British, and exploited by him as a stbk to beat us with, its exponents to-day were Gbeiduliah, Abd el-Aziz Shawish, Shekib Arslan, and Assad Shucair, four blackguards without an ounce of Islam or honesty between them, and its nominal holder, the Sultan of the Turks, was a pi table laughing-stock ; the invention had been fatal to Islam ; it tried to twist a religion into a political theory ancl was responsible for unrest in Turkey, Arabia, Egypt, North Africa, Java, India and China. Tt had plunged Turkey into the present war, and caused the Arab revolt, and with this example before his eyes, and in view of his own policy of friendship with Great Britain, he could neither acknowledge another&apos;s Khalifate, assume one himself, or admit the existence of the theory.The title Emir el-Muminin was one that a sincere Moslem might adopt.   It made no pretence to any succession to the
prophet, but was objectionable politically, on account of the word Emir.&quot; It was no use being Emir, without the power or pro-ten ce of giving orders, not to a sect, or a country or two, but to the Moslem world. The main divisions ol: Shia and Sunni would unite under this title, but the smaller sects, and especially the alien congregations in India and Africa, would resent the impli-cation of authority, as, no doubt, would the Great Powers.His policy for Islam was to provide in Mecca and Medina for the honourable upkeep of the Holy Places, to facilitate the pilgrimage, and to issue Fetwas and Sberia decisions as required. The Moslem world must have a head, but it would be a less tem-pestuous body of thought if the head was the Sherif and Emir of, Mecca, basing his light on the concrete possession of the Holy Planes, and on an authentic descent, not on a supposed implicit apostolic authority, inherited from an unbroken succession of Khalifas. His motives in rebelling against the Turks were two. The first is a political object ; the liberation of the Arab world from Turkish domination ; this lie will effect without question of creed ; Christian, Druse, Shia and Sunni meet on a common base of nationality, and must co-operate with him on level terms if the aim is to be achieved. His second motive was a religious one, purely Islamic in character ; it is to provide for the Mohammedan world an independant sovereign, ruling in the Holy Places, of the Sherifian family, whose claims to the spiritual leadership of Islam will be so transcendent as to be generally admitted, but whose weakness in material resources (money, ships, and guns) will at once make him acceptable to the Christian Powers, and purge Islam of the lunatic idea that it is a polity, bound tempo-rally to a single infallible head. His ideal is a spiritual city, not a theocracy. To attain this aim he must have temporalities enough, free of foreign control, to establish his claim to political competence, and must be delivered from the hierarchical theories which have plunged Turkey, the Senussi and x\li Dinar into suicidal jehads. His temporalities he will hold as King of the Arab countries, and his spiritualities as Emir of Mecca.My personal opinion is that the title of Emir el-Munhnin would not be repugnant to him, if it came not as his assumption but as the homage of his followers. It is generally used by the tribes to day from Kaf to Kunfida, and will apparently be accept-able to the Sheikhs of urban Syria. His present objection, that it involves the power of command in Islam, does not hold good, since it is as fair to interpret it only in a doctrinal sense.As for the Khalifate, the sincere disgust he expressed, of Abdul Hamicbs bogus claims, and his only half-veiled acknowlegement-ment of Shia tenets himself, made me certain that this opposition to the idea is a matter of principle. Further, I do not think that all the temptations of&quot; the world would persuade Sherif Hussein to run counter to his principles. His transparent honesty and strength of conviction (while they may prevent him distin-guishing between his prejudices and his principles) will at all
costs ensure his shaping his conduct exactly in accordance with his promised word. It would be easy to influence him in coming to a decision, but once his mind is made up it would be a thank-less task to try and make him change it.He appears to hope that, by ignoring the political disinte-gration of Islam, he may be able to concentrate attention on its dogmatic differences and do something to reduce the friction between sects. His appeal would be to moderate Sunni and moderate Shia to meet together under his presidency, and try to restrain the extremists in their camps.T.E.L.The Occupation of Ahaba.The following account by Captain Lawrence supplements information already given on pages 307-308 above. The irregularity of the Hejaz mail service is responsible for the delaj7 in its publication :-By Monday, June 18, we had enrolled 535 Toweiha (of whom twenty-five Avere horsemen), about 150 Rualla (under Benaiah ibn Dughmi, Durzi&apos;s brother) and Sherarat (under Geraitali el-Azmi), and thirty-five Kawachiba, under Dhami. Of these we chose nearly 200, and left them as guards for the tribal tents in Wadi Sirhan. With the rest we marched out of Kaf in the afternoon, and on June 20 entered Bair, after an easy but waterless march over the Suwan. At Bair we found one well filled in, two seriously damaged, and&apos;a fourth unhurt : the Turks had come there a little time before with Hamd el-Arar, and tried to blow them in with gelignite. They used an electric exploder clumsily, and we removed many tamped charges from the sides of the still open wells.Circumstances forced us to stay in Bair till Thursday Jane 28. The time was spent in negotiations with Ibn Jazi and the smaller sub-sections of the Howeitat on the Akaba road. We also carried out demolitions against the railway at Atwi, Sultani, Mini-fir, and elsewhere. The Ageyl dynamitarcls were inefficient, and our supply of dynamite small, so that the demolitions were of a pin-prick character, meant only to distract the Turks, and advertise our coining to the Arabs. The staffs of two stations were killed, to the same intent.From Bair we marched to El-Jefer, wdiere we stayed till Juby 1. The Turks had been more successful in their efforts against the wells here, and we had some difficulty in digging one out. The water proved sufficient for about 300 men and camels, when it was obtained. The station buildings of Maan and Hamra are visible, from El-Jefer, about twenty-four miles
off, but the Turks did not realise that we had arrived in force, owing to the operations near Amman, undertaken at this time by a flying column of 100 men, under Sheikh Zaal. This led them to believe us still in Wadi Sirhan, and on the 30th they sent a force of 400 cavalry with four machine guns, and Nawaf ibn Shaalan as guide, from Deraa to go to Kaf and find us. The Turks seem unable to discriminate the true from the false, out of the flood of news unquestionably brought them by the local Arabs.From El-Jefer a flying column rode to Fuweilah, about seventeen miles south-west of Maan, and in concert with the Dhumaniya Howeitat (Sheikh Gasim) attacked the gendarme post on the motor road to Akaba. In the fighting some mounted gendarmes got into a group of undefended Howeitat tents, and stabbed to death an old man, six women and seven children, the only occupants. Our Arabs in consequence wiped out the post, but not before some had escaped to Maan.This news reached Maan at dawn on the 1st, and a battalion of the 178th Regiment which had arrived at Maan from Zungul-da.k on the day before, was immediately ordered out to Fuweilah to relieve the post. The same afternoon we descended on the line at kilometre 479, near Ghadir el Haj, and carried out exten-sive demolitions till nearly sunset, when we marched westward, intending to sleep at Batra. On the way, however, we were met by messengers from our Fuweilah column, reporting the coming of new troops from Maan, and wevswung northwards, marching a great part of the night, till we were able at dawn to occupy the crests of the low rolling grass-covered hills that flank each side of the Akaba road near Aiu Aba el-Lissan. The Turks had reached Fuweilah, to find only vultures in possession, ancl moved to Aba el-Lissan, fourteen miles from Maan, for the night. The spring has been built round, and piped, and is much smaller than it used to be before the war, but is still sufficient for perhaps 2,000 men ancl animals. The battalion camped next the water, and kept together in the bottom of the valley, so that we were able to take the higher ground (at from 400 to 600 yards range) without difficult)&apos;.We sat here throughout July 2, sniping the Turks steaclil)-all day, ancl inflicted some loss. The Turks replied with shrapnel from a mountain gun, firing twenty rounds, which were all they had. The shells grazed our hill-tops, ancl burst far away over the valleys behind. When sunset came, Auda Abu Tayi collected the fifty horsemen now with us, in a hollow valley about 200 yards from the Turks, but under cover, and suddenly charged at a wild gallop into the brown of them, shooting furiously from the saddle as he came. The unexpectedness of the move seemed to strike panic into the Turks (about 550 strong), and after a burst of rifle fire, they scattered, in all directions. This was our signal., and all the rest of our force (perhaps 350 men, for some were watching the road on the east) dashed down the hillsides into the hollow,
as fast as the camels would go. The Turks were all infantry, and the Arabs all mounted, and the mix-up round the spring in the dusk, with 1,000 men shooting like mad, was considerable. As the Turks scattered, their position at once became hopeless, and in five minutes it was merely a massacre, in all I counted 300 enemy dead in the main position, and a few fugitives may have been killed further away, though the majority of our men went straight for the Turkish camp to plunder it, before the last, shots were fired. The prisoners came to 160 (three officers), mostly taken by Sherif Nasir and myself, since the Arabs in the Maan area are very bitter against the Turks, and are set on killing all they can. They have some reason for this attitude, in the slaughter of the women and children mentioned above, and in the previous execution of Sheikh Abd el-Rahman, a Belgawiya from Kerak. He was popular, and anti-Turk, but the Government caught him, and harnessing him between four wild mules tore him to death. This was the culmination of a series of executions by torture in Kerak, and the memory of them has embittered local opinion.The Arab losses in the fight came to two killed (a Rualla and a Sherarat) and several wounded, including Sheikh Benaiah ibn Dughmi. Considering the amount of firing, the confusion, the close quarters at which we were, and the Turkish casualties, the Arabs must be held to have got off very luckily. Several horses were hit in the cavalry charge,&quot;&apos;and Anda himself (in front, of course) had a narrow escape, since two bullets smashed his field glasses, one pierced his revolver holster, three struck his sheathed sword, and his horse was killed under him. He was wildly pleased with the whole affair.Unfortunately, many of our prisoners were wounded and we had very few spare camels with us. Those who could hold on were mounted behind Arabs on the spare camels ; but we had to abandon the worst cases at Aba el-Lissan, and of those we took with us about fifty died of heat, hunger and thirst on the road down to Akaba. The heat in the Hesma and Wadi Itm was terrible, and the water between Fuweilah and Akaba, only sufficient for perhaps 200 men and animals. For the matter of food, Nasir and I had taken two months&apos; supply with us from Wejh, and were now two months out; the Beclu had their own food with them in their saddle bags, but Arab rations are ill-adapted, in quality and quantity, for Turkish soldiers. We did what we could for the prisoners, but everybody went short.From Aba el-Lissan we marched to Guweira (22 miles) after sending out a column which destroyed Mreiga, the nearest gendarme post to Maan, on the Akaba road. At Guweira we received the surrender of the garrison (of about 120 men), their intermediary being Hussein ibn Jad, wdio joined us here on July 4. The motor road is finished to the foot of Nagb el-Star, from Maan, but not metalled anywhere. As the soil  is fairly hard  loam,  I   think   it should  suffice   for the
passage of a series of light cars. The Nagb is very steep, with bad hairpin corners, and will require improvement. The tlesma is of tine red sand, soft along the track, but harder in the bed of the watercourse which runs down from the loot of the Nagb to Guweira. From Guweira we marched down Wadi Itmto Ketliira (18 miles) where we overran a Turkish post of about seventv infantry and fifty mounted men, taking most of them prisoners, and thence we went on to near Khadra, at the old stone dam in Wadi Itm (15 miles), where we came into contact with the garrison (300 men) of Akaba.. They had retired here from the village itself (about six miles away) to be out of view of the sea, and on the line of retreat towards Maan. The news of our fight at Fuweilah had reached Akaba quickly, and all the Am ran, Darausha, Heiwat and sub-tribes of the Howeitat near Akaba had risen, and collected round the Ivhadra post, which had held thein at bay from their trenches with small casualties for two days. When Nasir and the banner turned up the Arab excitement became intense, and preparations were made for an immediate assault. This did not fall in with our ideas, since (-pour encourager-rcu/er les autres) we wanted the news to get about that the Arabs accepted prisoners. All the Turks we met were most happy to surrender, holding up their arms and crying &quot;Muslim, Muslim&quot; as soon as they saw us. They expressed themselves willing and anxious to go on fighting foreigners and Christians till they dropped, but with no intention of adding a Moslem enemy to the powers already against them. To save the Khadra garrison from massacre Sherif Nasir had to labour from after-noon till dawn, but he eventually carried his point (by our going ourselves between the Arab and the Turkish lines, to break their field of fire), and with the prisoners (now about 600 in- number) we marched into Akaba on the morning of July 6. The asto-nishment of a German N.C.O. (well-boring at Khadra) when the Sherifs force appeared was comic. He knew neither Arabic nor Turkish, and had not been aware of the Arab revolt.The situation at Akaba was now rather serious, economically. We had no food, GOO prisoners and many visitors in prospect. Meat was plentiful, since we had been killing riding camels as required, and there were unripe dates in the palm groves. These saved the day, but involved a good deal of dis-comfort after the eating, and the force in Akaba Avas very unhappy till the arrival of H.M.S. &quot; Dufferin &quot; on the 13th with food from Suez. Before she arrived, Arab forces were sent northward to occupy the hills up to Wadi Musa (Petra), some sixty miles from Akaba, and southward to join up with the Beni Atiych, and reconnoitre the country with a view to an eventual offensive against the railway south of Maan.
NOTES.Abyssinian Nevis.The Bitwaded, Haili Griorgis (p. 152), was arrested and chained on July 11, by order of the Empress and Ras Taffari, aiid instructions issued to seize all his property. From an early hour, the Ghebbi was filled with troops, and the Bitwaded was then summoned to attend the council, and, on his refusing to come, on the plea of ill-health, Ras Demissie was sent with a strong force to bring him. The arrest was made without any incident.Relations between Ras Taffari and Haili Griorgis have been strained since the Revolution. For eight years, the Bitwaded, thanks to his undoubted intelligence, had held the reins of government in his own hand, which meant complete liberty to further his own financial interests, and he had evidently determined to make his support of the new government conditional on his being allowed to retain his power. To this Ras Taffari would not consent, and not only declined to bring him in to his intimate councils but deprived him first of the controllers!lip of the railway, and then of the governorship of the market. It was the Bitwaded&apos;s refusal to hand over this offer to his successor that furnished the ostensible reason for his arrest. The real reasons were no doubt his opposition to the assumption of authority by Ras Taffari, and the suspicion, under which he has recently fallen, of communicating with Lij Yasu.The general result of this incident is likely to be satisfactory It is the first trial of strength between Ras Taffari and his ministers, and the fact that he has been able to crush the Bitwaded will raise his prestige with a people who despise weakness.A telegram from Adis Abeba, dated July 30, reports that a part of Lij Yasu&apos;s force has left Magdala and occupied the capital of Edju.Lij Yasu has left a garrison at Magdala, but his own where-abouts are not stated. There is no news of the movements of the Government troops wdio were surrounding Magdala (p. 295), but they have presumably abandoned the siege and dispersed.Ras Hailu of Gojjam (p. 316), during his recent visit to Adis Abeba, is reported to have strongly advised the Government to put an end to German and Turkish intrigues in Abyssinia.The Ansariya.li.The following additional information has been received about the Ansariyah (see Nos. 54 and 56 of the Bulletin) : The most important tribes among these people are the Mlielba and the Kalbieh. The chief of the former is Khair Bey, a man of forty-eight years, who lives at Kalaat el-Mhelba.     The
Government made him chief of the Ansariyah volunteers, and he has under his control various other tribes such as Hamarra, Darussi, Beit el-Benar, Beni Ali, Beit Yashuta, Beit el-Hadad, Metaura, Beit el-Khayat ancl the inhabitants of the Latakiya Plain. He is reputed to be an Anglophile and to have been on good terms with the British Consular Agent before the war. The second most important individual in the tribe is his cousin, Shakir Derwish Aga Khair Beg, who is about fifty-five years old ancl lives at El-Fakura. The Mhelba with their subordinate tribes number about 4,000 males, of whom about 150 or 200 are armed, mostly with Greek Gras rifles, ancl are excellent shots. Their sympathies, like those of the Kalbieh, are said to lie with the rich and the ,strong ; but especially with the rich, among whom they reckon the British and the French.The Kalbieh are reported to be able to put 2,000 men into the field, of whom a few are armed with Mausers, ancl are a more efficient fighting force than the Mhelba. Their chief is Aziz Ismail, who also controls the people of Karahla, Nuasra, Bashauna, Jalkish, Jelmi and Beit Mohammed.Abdullah Ibn Dakhil.In the last Bulletin (p. 330) we referred to the intrigues of a certain Ibn Dakhdivi in connection with the relations between King Husein and Ibn Saud. We are now informed that the real name of this man is Abdullah ibn Dakhil, one of the sheikhs of Russ, in Qasim, and that he. was formerly an envoy from Sherif Feisal to Nuri Shaalan and Ibn Rashid. He recently left Wejh, having made himself highly unpopular there as commander of the Ageyl, and was sent to Mecca, where he had nothing to do. Soon after this the King received the letter (see p. 314) in which Sherif Abdullah mentioned Ibn Saud&apos;s intention of making the pilgrimage, and advised the King not to allow him to do so. This letter was followed immediately by a letter from Sherif Feisal, giving the same information and the same advice. Feisal added that he had received the information in a letter from Ibn Dakhil at Mecca, and there is little doubt that Abdullah&apos;s informant was the same. The story, as presented to Feisal, not unnaturally aroused his suspicious, ft was, according to King HusehVs statement to Colonel Wilson, that Ibn Saud had sent messengers to his agents and friends in Mecca and rJeddah, ask-ing them what his reception would be if he came to Mecca at the forthcoming pilgrimage- season, and that the answers were that he should come with his men ancl that he would find no force in Southern Hejaz to interfere in any way with his liberty of action.The King, as soon as lie received Feisal&apos;s letter, sent for Ibn Dakhil ancl asked for an explanation. Ibn Dakhil replied that he had sent, no such letter to Feisal. The King said that he preferred to take FcisaPs word for that, and threw Ibn Dakhil into prison.
Capture of Teima.The capture of Teima by the local Anazeh, reported on page 330, is likely to lead to their more effective co-operation with the Sherif. They recently held up a caravan from Hail, consisting of artillery, troops and supplies, but not being in sufficient strength to attack, they merely demanded and were given forty rifles. The Turks are believed to be seriously alarmed at the prospect of Teima being used as a base for attacks on the. railway, and may be expected to make a determined attempt to recapture it and chastise the Anazeh. The Turkish officers at Hail are reported to be short of cash, as Ibn RashicTs grandmother, who has pro-British - sympathies, holds the purse strings and refuses to provide him with funds.Hejaz Intelligence.The Akaba situation shows little development. The Turkish force that occupied Fuweilah (strength about two battalions with some hundreds of mounted men) has not attempted any forward move. As far as Aba el-Lissan and Fuweilah, the road from Maan to Akaba runs over open rolling country, affording little oppor-tunity for the exercise of Arab tactics, and the water supply at Aba el-Lissan is enough for perhaps 5,000 men. After Fuweilah the road descends the steep Nagb el-Star (dropping nearly 2,000 feet in a, zigzag road of about four miles) and then runs over the sandy plain of El-his majesty&apos;s , which is studded with precipitous rock-pinnacles of red sandstone. Behind one of these, at Guweira (twenty miles from Fuweilah) are the present headquarters of Auda Abu Tayi, who has about 600 Hovveitat with him. The water at Guweira lies in two side valleys to the north, and is sufficient for about 2,000 men, but difficult of access. After Guweira the Akaba road runs up a broad valley to a watershed, and then runs for twenty miles through the gorge of Wadi [tin, a - watercourse from forty to 300 yards wick, with cliff sides 300 to 3,000 feet high serrated and broken in the wildest way. The bed is rough underfoot, turns and twists through the hills, and has no water supply in it, though weak springs exist in side ravines, from one to three miles off the road.The Arab tactics are to allow the Turks to advance to Guweira and beyond, sniping them when possible, and cutting off patrols and supply caravans. In Wadi Ltm itself they would hold all the water sources strongly and occupy the hills each side of the main valley. The Turkish problem is to carry enough water from Aba el-Lissan to Akaba (fifty-five miles) to support the relatively con-siderable body of troops necessary to force Wadi ftm, and maintain itself before Akaba, where the wells, being all under machine gun fire from the sea, cannot be*reliecl on as available for an attacking force. A hurried Turkish advance on Akaba is therefore hardly to be looked for, as it is impossible unless the Turks can persuade a sufficient number of the Slierifian Arabs to cease fighting, and
gather quantities of. camels from the Turcophil Arabs. They have ma.de efforts in both directions, but so far without much success. Auda Abu Tayi remains unsbakeably Arab, and he commands a following so long as he remains in the field. He has lately sent Mohammed el-Dheilan to near Ghadir el-Haj (a bridge and about forty rails cut), Auda ibn Zaal to near Batu el-Ghul (two bridges blown up), and Zaal ibn Motlog to Aneze (a bridge destroyed). These raids were to distract the Turkish attention from the Fuweilah district, and something on a larger scale will be attempted as soon as more materials are available. A compound Garland mine at Atwi shattered the firebox of the leading locomotive, and overturned the second, of a double-engined train.Turkish aeroplanes have made many short flights over Auda&apos;s forces (inflicting one casualty and causing panics) but have not been able to visit Akaba again.Further details have been received about the attacks on the railway reported in the last Bulletin. On July 28, Sherif FeisaFs force destroyed 1,000 rails between Bedai and Bir Gedid. At Seil Matara Sherif Sharraf captured fifty prisoners, including three officers. On July 31, Jaafar Pasha&apos;s force had a twelve hours&apos; fight with the Turks at Zumrud, where the Egyptians occupied a fort two miles from the station for some days. The result of the fighting was indecisive, but the Turks were driven back and lost about fifty killed and wounded and fifty prisoners. The Egyptians had two wounded and two captured, and the Arabs about fifty killed and wounded.Between Hedieand Muderij^a party under Major Joyce and a Sherif destroyed over 700 mils (four kilometres) on July 27 ; the enemy attacked from each station bur, were held off until the demolition was complete.Another raid by Sherif Abdullah&apos;.- forces was carried out on August 2 between Toweira and Way ban, where about 1,400 charges were exploded and about six kilometres of railroad, inclucl-ing seven culverts, were thoroughly demolished. In an engagement near Toweira the Arabs lost one man killed and claim to have killed thirty-three Turks. Both of these raids were carried out by day.Emir Feisal, a Sheikh of the Jerba Shainmar, has arrived at Mecca with thirty-five followers and offered his services to the Sherif. The latter is arranging for him to return shortly to Mesopotamia and has recommended him to visit the G.O.C., Baghdad, with a view to assisting the operations of the British on the Tigris.
