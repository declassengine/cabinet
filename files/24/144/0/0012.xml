SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT, No. XXXVII.Russia.THERE is nothing to add to last week&apos;s appreciation. We have no news from Tashkent.roomania.The use of Russian prisoners should be noted. It is a curious fact that as prisoners of war the Russians are amenable and industrious, while as troops and citizens they are the reverse.Turkey (Baghdad Railway).Dr. Gwinner&apos;s arrival in Switzerland should be noted. He is one of the Baghdad Railway directors and well in touch with Turcophil international finance.Turkey (German Press). The denial of the British success at Ramadie is interesting as it betrays weakness.Turkey (the ex-Khedive).The ex-Khedive is now fairly launched on his journey. We may exjaect much trouble in the Arab world as the result of his departure. His mission will be to confuse the Syrians, endeavour to get into touch with the King of Hijaz, and bribe the Arabs. He will have the moral support of Falkenhayn at Aleppo besides plenty of gold. The ex-Khedive is a big physical coward and confirmed waverer, but has brains and charm and has always been well in with the Syrians and pilgrimage officials. It must have required some good reason to have got him on the move ; possibly the Bolo revelations threatened to make his stay in Switzerland uncomfortable. The mental play between the ex-Khedive and his C.U.P. colleagues should be very handsome, as neither party trusts the other, and both are past masters in the arts of dissimulation.Egypt.The new Sultan is enlightened and broad-minded and favourable to progress on European lines.Arabia.The report about the King of Hijaz from an Italian source need not be credited, but it should be noted as a possibility in view of the K.hedive&apos;s departure for Constantinople.Zionism.The news that the Germans are beginning to look towards Zionism as a war asset is somewhat ominous. .The Germans most likely realise that under post-war conditions the fertile valleys and well-watered districts of Judea and Moab are not going to be allowed to lie fallow.   They also are probably well aware that whatever be the outcome[898-64]
of the war Zionism is going to be a constant factor in world politics. The wealth&apos; arid impetus behind the Zionist movement make it more than probable that sooner or later Jewish colonisation will increase and spread in Palestine... The Germans, who have in the past endeavoured and failed to Germanise the Zionist movement, are apparently going to make another effort to establish a Germanophil sentiment in the Zionist colonies. It is to be noted that the Germans have hitherto gone easy on Zionism out of fear of the Turks. The gradual weakening of Tuikev now perhaps makes the Germans less politic in this respect, and having- exhausted the physical resources of Turkey in war, they are looking to exploiting the natural sentiments of the Jews for post-war ends.&quot;Vatican and Armenians.The Vaticaids reply to Boghos Pasha is of great interest: it is in harmony with the &quot;Vatican suggestion in regard to Poland, and equally unsatisfactory for the Central Powers.Caucasus (see Latest Intelligence).- The Armenian situation in the Caucasus and the occupied districts of Asiatic Turkey, as exposed in the letter addressed to Boghos Nubar Pasha by a competent authority, is serious. The danger which Js to be apprehended is the coalition of the Georgian Christians with the Tartars in the Caucasus itself and the subsequent combination of these elements with the Turks. The Turkish policy of pan-Turanianism arms at linking up the Anatolian Turks with the Turks of Bokhara and North Persia Ada the Caucasus. The troubles at Tashkent referred to last week are undoubtedly connected with this movement. The Armenians are the only possible barrier between the Turks and their great Central-Asian objective, and no efforts will be spared to remove the obstacle. British interest in the fate of the Armenians now passes from mere sentimental and humanitarian fee ing to a mAfter of grave material concern. The pan-Turanian scheme is to mobilise simu taneoasly Central-Asian man power and pseudo-Moslem fanaticism under Stamboul control against South Persia, Afghanistan, and India. Tne menace, though perhaps seemingly distant, is exceedingly real, and our only real weapons against it are the Arabs and Armenians, who have sufficient racial vitality to repel the Turanian policy. The weakness of the Georgians, Kurds, and Persians is such that they fall an easy prey to the C.U.P. agents, while the Russian Government, so long our protector, are against this particular development.The Basra Mosque.The Basra mosque case arises, in the first instance, from the efforts of the military authorities to procure a mosque for Indian troops on the ground that the Indian troops at Basra were subject to enemy propaganda in the local mosques. The political officers deprecated the idea of the Governments taking such action on the ground that it would be offensive to the local Arabs. If the Government had built the mosque we should certainly have been accused of endeavouring as Christians to divide the brotherhood of Islam. Eventually a fairly unsatisfactory arrangement was arrived at whereby some Indian notables were prevailed upon to contribute as mill sum to defray the cost of the building- As a sequel the Sikhs now ask for equal facilities, and in,so doing raise a serious question. The Arab Moslems regard Jews, Christians, and Sabeans as people of the book, Avho in this imperfect world may be tolerated, but Sikhs they could not fail to group as idolators. and their places of worship as heathen temples.
According to Arab Moslem views if such a place is built the British will appear as Christians too careless to build a church for their own troops, but ready to build the temples of Kaffirs. It must be remembered that Arabian Moslems regard heathenism from quite a different point of view to Indian Moslems, who are accustomed to live in a country where many of their esteemed fellow-citizens regard beasts, birds, and obscene phallic emblems as proper objects of reverence.The Arab has an Old Testament loathing of heathenism which amounts to physical abhorrence. If anything coidd drive the peninsular Arabs into the arms of the Turks it would be the idea that the evils of British penetration would not be confined to the introduction of white prostitution and alcohol, but that the re-establishment of paganism would be a part of our programme.The whole affair goes to show that the political officers were right in the first instance, and that it would have been better to have left the mosque alone.Armenia (Boglios Pasha s Memorandum, see Appendix B).Particular attention is drawn to His Excellency Boghos Pasha&apos;s statement of the Armenian policy. It will be seen how reasonable, moderate, and statesmanlike his proposals are, and that, unlike most of the Oriental national parties, the Armenians are prepared to look facts in the face and trust to European tutelage and assistance. This is far from being a sign of a consciousness of weakness but the reverse ; the Armenians have such confidence in their own capacity, based on experience of individual success in America, India, and Egypt, that they feel that once granted security and equality before the law they can easily hold their own.M.

The Armenian Question by Nubar Pasha.* See Latest Intelligence.RUSSIA.The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs [Petrograd. No. 1553 of the 3rd October, 1917] in conversation with Sir George Buchanan, seemed a little discouraged by the number of contradictory resolutions passed by the Democratic Congress, first in favour of a Coalition Government, then in favour of excluding Cadets, and finally against both ideas. A threatened railway strike complicated the situation yet further. In accordance with the decision [Petrograd No. 1556 of the 1th October, 1917] unanimously demanded by the Democratic Congress not to separate until the establishment had been secured of a Government acceptable in its form and functions to organised democracy, the Directorate of the Congress, supplemented by delegates of all the groups represented, passed the following resolutions, proposing: (1) the organisation of a Government based on the programme declared by M. Chkhedze at the Moscow Conference ; (2) an active foreign policy aiming at the speediest possible conclusion of universal peace ; (3) the responsibility of whatever Government should be created to a special representative body organised by the Congress ; (4) the formation of a special organ to negotiate with the parties for the consideration- of a Govern-ment; (5) the inclusion, if necessary, of representatives of the propertied and bourgeois interests in the special body mentioned in point 3. Finally the Directorate rejected the proposal for a Coalition Government by 60 votes to 50, notwithstanding a detailed explanation by M. Kerensky of the financial, economic, and political situation, his expressed conviction that only a Coalition Government could save the country, and his statement that should the Congress take a contrary decision he would resign, and would take no part in the formation of a purely Socialist Govern-ment, which, in his opinion, might lead to the liquidation of a revolution and the ruin of the country.The resolution passed by the Directorate was that submitted to a plenary sitting of the Congress. Each point was voted separately, with the following results: points 1, 2. 3, and 4 were passed by the majority of approximately 10 to 1 ; point 5 was passed, but with a considerable number of abstentions; and an additional point insisting on the[898-64] B
preponderance of democratic elements in the body specified in point 3 was carried by large majority. During the voting a remark made by M. Tserefelli was interpreted by the Extreme Left as an aspersion against their party, and &quot;his refusal of a demand to withdraw the statement he had made led to a scene and the temporary suspension of the sitting. Upon its reassembly the resolution of the Directorate was proposed en bloc, ,and passed by a majority of 829 votes to 105, with 69 abstentions. The Bolshevists withdrew in a body and took no part in this vote, as a protest against the behaviour of Tseretelli. The resolutions thus passed [Petrograd No. 1557 of the 4th October, 1917\ created a deadlock, from which it seemed impossible to see any issue. The only recognised Government was the Council of Five, as other Ministers were acting simply as departmental chiefs. The expected members of the Moscow groups had not arrived, preferring, before assuming office, to wait for the closing of the Congress. M. Kerensky must now either disregard the resolutions of the Congress and govern in spite of them or resign, allowing the Socialists to form a Government or attempt a compromise by accepting a Government composed of Socialists and those of the propertied classes who did not belong to the Cadet party. This latter seemed the most probable solution. The Minister of Foreign Affairs was at Moscow, absenting himself for a few days in order to mark his dissatisfaction with the Government inaction, as he considered that the gauntlet should be thrown down to the Bolshevists and the workmen be compelled to surrender their arms. M. Kerensky, on the other hand [Petrograd No. 1563 of the 4th October, 1917], did not take a pessimistic view of the situation. He had no intention of changing the composition of the Government and did not think that the Bolshevists were prepared to face the forces of organisation. Sir George Buchanan telegraphed on the 5th October [No. 1567] to the effect that an understanding would probably be come to in the course of the day between M. Kerensky and the Congress, the delegates of which, who had at first presented their demands almost as an ultimatum, had since altered their tone, and were now apparently ready to allow the Government to organise what is known as a Pre-parliament. This was to be composed of a variety of parties and organisations represented in the Moscow Conference, including some of the Cadets a condition vwhicb seems to imply that the Congress would no longer oppose the participation of Cadets in the coalition. M. Kerensky intended to give the Pre-parliament the character of a Council of State, which would have the right of interpellation though with purely consultative powers, the Govern-ment being in no way responsible to it, and retaining all its executive and legislative powers.In order to counteract the demoralising propaganda of Bolshevists and Germans in the army, it has been decided [Petrograd No. 1573 of the 6th October, 1917] to start a weekly illustrated paper in Russian for circulation among the troops in the rear and at the front. The proposal, which emanated from the Allied Ambassadors in Petrograd, was warmly welcomed by the Minister of War, who promised every assistance. The Ambassador urges British co-operation in this work as some small counterpoise to the millions spent by Germany on propaganda organised by a regular staff with thousands of agents all over the country.The Minister of Foreign Affairs [Petrograd No. 1578 of the 7th October, 1917], in a letter of the 6th October to the Prime Minister, formally tendered his resignation, although there is reason to hope that he will withdraw it. Flis two main points were (l) that wherever the Pre-parliament had been established the Soviet shoidd be dissolved, and (2) that the Government should be in no way responsible to the Pre-parliament.Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No.. 1577 of the 8th October, 1917] that the recon-struction negotiations now proceeding between the representatives of the propertied classes of the Democratic Congress had made some progress. - An agreement was reached on the declaration to be made of the Governments policy, also with regard to the establishment of the Pre-parliament. The Socialist delegates reported the results of the sitting to the Democratic Council, and while accepting the proposals in principle, advocated an active foreign policy based upon the speediest possible conclusion of peace and the summoning of an inter-allied conference for the revision of treaties. As regards the Pre-parliament, it was arranged that it should include representatives of the propertied classes with a two-thirds democratic majority, and should have the right to interpellate the Government, so that, although the Government would not be formally or juridically responsible, in practice no Government without a majority in the Pre-parliament will be possible. Upon the discussion of this report the Democratic Council passed a resolution recognising the formation of the Pre-parliament as a real step towards the creation of a stable authority, and declaring it necessary to establish the
former responsibility of the Government to the Pre-parlfement. A Bolshevist amencl-ment against the inclusion of members of the Cadet party in the Cabinet was lost by a two to one majority.His Majesty&apos;s Government have telegraphed [No. 3421 of the 9th October, 1917] to Sir R. Paget that they are unable to appoint a delegate to take part in the proposed conference between Russian and enemy delegates at Copenhagen respecting prisoners of war.ROUMANIA.Sir G. Barclay [No. 598 of the 7th October, 1917J remains firm in his conviction that neither the King nor Prime Minister took any part in any peace negotiations, but he finds himself unable to answer for the future. The food outlook, unless Russia can pull herself together, will before long become desperate, and evacuation into Russia in its present chaotic state is a gloomy prospect. At the same time the King and Prime Minister seem certain to fight to the utmost of their power the idea of a separate peace. The above gloomy impression was confirmed by the Prime Minister [Jassy No. 599 of the 7th October, 1917], who, in a conversation on the 6th with Sir G. Barclay, feared that the object of the German Emperor&apos;s visit to the Roumanian front had been to stimulate the King of Bulgaria to further violent efforts against Roumania. The anarchic state of affairs in Russia and deplorable food outlook in Moldavia were strengthening the hands of those in favour of a separate peace, especially the Jews, who were pro-Germans, and other numerous people. He emphasised the- desperate nature of Roumania&apos;s financial situation. The orders received on the 7th [Jassy No. 600 of the 7th October, 1917] to transfer 18,000 Serbian troops now serving at Galatz to Salonika are from a political point of view strongly deprecated by Sir G. Barclay, who forwarded on the 8th [No. 614 of the 8th October, 1917] an urgent request from the King that he should endeavour to bring about their retention on the Roumanian front.A special commission for the purpose of examining Roumanian, financial, and economic requirements is proposed for establishment on an international basis [Foreign Office to Jassy No. 379 of the 5th October, 1917]. --Through a reliable source, it would appear that the whole of the occupied territory of Roumania is being scientifically cultivated by the Germans, who are employing as labour thousands upon thousands of Russian prisoners of war. The Russian prisoners are amenable, give no trouble, and work well. The soil is even better than had been expected, and the petroleum wells are on the way to complete restoration. On the other hand, a leading merchant recently arrived from Budapest [Berne No. 905 of the 3rd October, 1917] stated that very little oil from Roumania reached Austria and that it would take five years, owing to the thorough nature of the destructive measures, to arrive at the rate of production before the war.His Majesty&apos;s Government [Foreign Office telegram No. 2082 of the 8th October, 1917] have accepted in principle the scheme for a Roumanian economic commission in Petrograd, while desiring that the Committee established should deal with the provision of material, and not consider the financial requirements of Roumania, also that its duties must not comprise any executive powers, but be restricted to the examination, co-ordination, and registration of the material requirements of the country.TURKEY.The ex-Khedive [Berne No. 925 of the 7th October, 1917] is reported to have left Zurich for the frontier on the 5th October, 1917.Sir H. Rumbold has received information [No. 918 of the 5th October, 1917] to the effect that Jemal Pasha would not be allowed to return to Syria and-that he was to all intents and purposes a prisoner in the hands of Enver and Talaat. One of the objects of Enver Pasha&apos;s recent visits to Germany was apparently [Berne No. 910 of the 4th October, 1917] to impress on the military authorities the urgent need of further German troops in Turkey. In an interview [Sir W. Townley, No. 3162 of the 6th October, 1917] granted by Radoslavoff to the correspondent of the &quot; Yossische Zeitung,&quot; Radoslavoff declared with emphasis that Bulgaria was in entire agreement with Turkey upon ail points, and that Germany and Turkey would not rest until the latter had regained Baghdad, an enterprise in which Bulgaria was ready to assist if so desired.Dr. Gwinner, the Baghdad railway boss, director of the Deutsche Bank, wdth other well-known German financiers has arrived in Switzerland. The &quot; Lokal- Anzeiger &quot; [No. 507 of the 5th October, 1917] contains a Constantinople telegram which says that
in their report of the 3rd October the English assert that in a battle in Mesopotamia they captured 13 guns, 12 machine guns, [?] men, 200 officers, and 600 wounded. This assertion is false. As usual the English spread abroad these lies in order to counteract their defeats on other fronts. Also in their report of the 26th September they mention large number of prisoners captured in district of Maan, in Palestine. These prisoners were really passengers in a train which was derailed and were women and children who were then captured by rebels. The English did not miss such an occasion of proclaiming a fresh great victory to the world.Sir H. Rumbold [No. 917 of the 3rd October, 1917] learns from a reliable source that the Turkish Government propose appointing Bustani Effendi and Mahmud Muktar Pasha as their representatives on the proposed commission for the exchange of Turkish and British prisoners.In view of the approach of winter, His Majesty&apos;s Government are endeavouring [Foreign Office to The Hague, No. 2759 of the 9th October] to obtain from the Porte a definite reply as to whether they intend to participate in the conference or no.It has been rumoured that Jambolat Bey was imprisoned on arriving at Constanti-nople. At Stockholm he had an uncomfortable time owing to his unpopularity with his diplomatic colleagues and. the apathy towards him of his own Government. He had consequently left his post and retired without reporting himself to the lies des Princes, where he is apparently isolated, if not imprisoned, in his own house.EGYPT.Sir R. Wingate telegraphs from Egypt [No. 1057 of the 9th October] : I deeply regret to report that Sultan Hussein Kamel died at Abdin Palace at 12*10 p.m. to-day. His Highness&apos;s funeral will take place at the Rifai Mosque, in Cairo. There is little doubt that His Highness&apos;s devotion to duty has hastened his premature demise. His reign has been marked by security and progress. The enemy has been driven from the gates of Egypt; agriculture has flourished; reforms have been initiated. History -will show the great measure in which the late Sultan&apos;s courage and sense of honour have contributed to gain these benefits for his country. In the Sultan&apos;s death Egypt suffers a national loss which cannot fail to evoke deep sympathy in England. On ascending the Egyptian throne, Prince Ahmed Fuad has requested me to convey to His Hajesty&apos;s Government his determination to follow the high example set by Sultan Hussein, and to labour, in close and loyal co-operation with His Majesty&apos;s Government, for the greatest good of Egypt.Prince Eamal-ed-Din, son of the late Sultan, has given a written disclaimer to the succession, and Prince Ahmed Fuad Pasha, brother of the la.te Sultan, a younger son of the Khedive Ismail [Cairo No. 1058 of the 9th August] has succeeded to the Sultanate, with warm assurances of complete loyalty to His Majesty&apos;s Government.ARABIA.Sir Percy Cox [No. 4035 of the 28th September, 1917] points out that Bin Saud, though not up to the presentable to help us very actively, is whole-heartedly on our side and anti-Turkish. An atmosphere of mutual suspicion continues to exist between him and the King of the Hijaz. Sir Percy would like to send a mission to him consisting of a political officer from Baghdad and one from Egypt, in wdiose opinion the Sherif would have confidence, with a view to dispelling the atmosphere of mistrust prevailing in both circles. On his part Bin. Saud [Sir P. Cox, No. 4045 of the 1st October, 1917], had telegraphed requesting the visit of the special officer promised him in the summer. Sir Jib Wingate [No. 1036 of the 5th October, 1917] concurs in the above idea, and while he has no political officer available for the moment in Egypt, can recommend sending a responsible Sherifial delegate who could be accompanied by a British military officer from Egypt.An Allied source reports that some two months ago the Sherif of Mecca began to negotiate with the Turkish Government on the basis of a reconciliation to include, amongst other prerogatives, his autonomy over the Holy Places, the intermediary being the Imam Yahya and the commander of the Turkish troops at Medina. There is no reason whatever to credit this.PERSIA.Sir C. Marling telegraphed [No. 329 of the 4th October, 1917] that, according to telegrams received by him, it&apos; was probable that the enemy were about to penetrate
Persia with Afghanistan as their objective. No support could be expected from Persia, and Sir C. Marling recommended a close collaboration with- Vossuk-ed-Dowleb, as being the statesman most likely to be able to form a friendly neutral Cabinet, there being practically no hope of any active assistance from the Persians.ZIONISM.It is reported that discussions have taken place in Berlin about the Palestine question, between Jemal Pasha, Dr. Von Kuhlmann, and a leading Zionist. Promises, which will not be kept, have been made to the Jews in order to secure their co-operation in the new war loan. Information is also to hand from a Zionist source that Count Bernstorff has entered into relations with the Jews in Constantinople to discuss the Palestine question. The Turks are annoyed at his trying to win over the Turkish Jews. Generally speaking the German Government, is trying to show the German Jews that it is interested in Palestine.The German Minister at Berne has recently had a long interview with a leading Swiss Jew respecting the Zionist movement.ARMENIA.Eminentissime Seigneur, Paris, le 21 aoiXt, 1917.Representant de Sa Saintete le Catholicos KeVork V, Patriarche supreme des Armebiens, et president de la Delegation nationale armenienne en Europe, je croirais manquer a un de mes plus inperieux devoirs, si je ne faisais part a votre Eminence de la profonde emotion et de la gratitude dont j&apos;ai ele&quot; penetre en lisant 1&apos;appel a la paix, adresse aux peuples de la terre par le Tres Saint Pere Sa Saintete Benoit XV.Tous les Armeniens sont touches jusqu&apos;au plus profond de leurs ames de voir qu&apos;en s&apos;elevant son auguste voix en faveur des nations opprimees auxquelles justice doit etre rendue, le Tres Saint Pere a specialement designe l&apos;Armenie et que, dans la sereine et sainte impartialite de son esprit.

The Russians sent a deputation of officers over to the Turks, and the Turks did the same ; but after this exchange of visits the Russian soldiers insisted on deputations of men and N.C.O.&apos;s being sent by each party. This was agreed to, and these two deputations spent several days with their bands with the other1 side. The Russians and Turks agreed that in future they would from time to time play at fighting, but that they would not kill each other.The Russians assured the Turks that they would evacuate Turkish territory altogether on the first day of peace, and that Turkey should enter into entire possession of the territory it had before the war. On this agreement the Turks withdrew a large part of their troops on the Armenian frontier and sent them towards Mosul for the great Baghdad offensive which they are to undertake in the month of November next, and another part of the troops towards Persia to reoccupy the places which they had to evacuate last year.That arrangement, if indeed it was come to, will be fatal to the Armenian Christians in Armenia, for Erzeroum, Van, and other Armenian towns which serve as places of refuge to Armenians, when they fall again into the hands of the Turks, will again be the tomb of the Armenians who had fled there.It would be well to make immediate enquiries in the Caucasus regarding this question, and if the report is true our unhappy compatriots must be removed from these regions into the interior of Russian Armenia.Another far more serious piece of news has been brought to me by a Turk who is generally very well informed. The Turks intend to profit by the disorganised state of the Russian army and the anarchy and disorder which reign at present in the Caucasus (where armed Kurdish bands attack the villages) to make an incursion into the Caucasus towards Tiflis (in spite of their promise to the Russians that they&quot; would in future only play at fighting), and, together with the Kurds and Tartars and other Moslem nationalities in the Caucasus, to whom they have sent secretly emissaries, to arrange a general rising of Moslems, and, with the aid of the Georgians, first of all to massacre all the Armenians in the Caucasus, whether Turkish or Russian subjects, and then join up with the Tartars of Kazan, the Turks of Turkestan, the Afghans, &amp;c., so as to have a continuous line of territory from Constantinople to India and China ! But the order is first of all to massacre the Armenians. This plan would be terrible -were it carried out, and in view of the disorganisation of the Russian army in the Caucasus it is very possible, the more so as millions of armed Russian Moslems will help.What must be done ?According to my humble opinion, it is necessary first of all to warn our Armenians in the Caucasus and in Russia of the Turkish plans, our Catholicos, the Armenian
deputies, Dr. Zarrief, and advise them to warn our compatriots of the danger in order that they may arm and organise themselves. Secondly, that the Russian Armenian soldiers who are on the Galician frontier and others should come with their officers without wasting any time to the Turco-Russian frontier in the Caucasus to drive back the Turks who wish to invade the Russian territory in the Caucasus. The matter is urgent. My duty was to advise your Excellency, who knows better than I do what mustdpe done and what must be written to our people, in the Caucasus. I am very anxious. If this diabolical plot of the Turks is carried out, it means the death of the entire Armenian nation.The Germans have sent two complete divisions of German soldiers and two divisions of Austrian and Czech soldiers with a quantity of Austrian artillery towards Mosul for the Baghdad offensive. A portion of the Turkish force in Galicia has been sent towards Baghdad. The Turco-German preparations for the recapture of Baghdad are vast.   Falkenhayn is there to direct operations.God grant that the English may resist this Turkish offensive, and that the battle of Baghdad may not be a second Kut-el-Amara.I beg you to send me a line to acknowledge receipt of this letter in order that I may feel calm.Accept, &amp;c.YERVANT.P.S. The ex-Khedive leaves for Constantinople the day after to-morrow. I need hardly say that the Georgians in the Caucasus, who hate the Armenians, are in agreement with the Turks.LATEST  INTELLIGENCE.RUSSIA.The Minister of Foreign Affairs received Sir G: Buchanan [No. 1584 of the 8th October, 1917] on that date and informed him that the composition of the new Government would be published that evening with himself as Minister for Foreign Affairs, but not as Vice-President of the Government, nor acting in Cabinet Councils except on questions of foreign policy, or when consulted by his colleagues, for advice, until the Government had elaborated a definite programme. His resignation and criticisms of the Government policy had made a great impression on his colleagues and the Cadets present formerly his bitterest enemies had declared that if he left the Government they would not enter it. He had therefore withdrawn his resignation, insisting, however, that the army must be reorganised at once. It had consequently been decided that M. Kerensky and one or two others should proceed to headquarters next day to initiate a searching enquiry into the whole matter. Without this he could not conscientiously submit to the Allies any military programme. He would not, therefore, be able to attend the Conference that is to meet at Paris at the end of the month, but General Alexeieff and M. Maklakoff, provisionally appointed Ambassador in Paris, would represent Russia, whilst he himself would attend the second Conference to be held some three months later, by which time he hoped to have received authentic military and financial data. Pie was urgent that Russia should be enabled to carry, on through the winter, as according to his information the Austrian internal situation was so grave that the Empire would not be able to hold out much longer.Yesterday Sir G. Buchanan [No. 1590 of the 10th October] with the Ambassadors of France and Italy, and in the presence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Vice-President of the Council, saw the Prime Minister.Sir G. Buchanan explained that the Ambassadors had deferred their request for an interview until the formation of the new Government under his presidency, and offered him the sincere congratulations of the Allied Powers. He then read the Ambassadors&apos; collective note.The conversation was conducted by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who interpreted for M. Kerensky. The latter spoke of the war as one not of Governments but of Nations, and emphasised the sacrifices which Russia had made in it, commenting upon the inheritance of disorganisation bequeathed by the Imperial regime. He observed that the Allies would have done better to have called it oftener to account. It was a pitv the Allies had shown hesitation in the revolution in the despatch of war [898-64] D
material, and it was necessary that there should be complete union between the Al ies as all would be ruined by the defection of one. Russia was determined, whatever the difficulties, upon war to the end. He was leaving that very afternoon for head quarters, on the task of army reorganisation. Finally, he remarked that Russia was still a great Power ; and hardly was this sentence translated, when he jumped up and signified with a wave of his hands the conclusion of the interview, shaking hands hurriedly with the Ambassadors, and making for the door so that Sir G. Buchanan was unable to reply, and had only time to hand him some documents and explain that the desire to strengthen his hands was the sole motive of the joint communication.M, Kerensky is apparently given to these theatrical effects, the impropriety of which the Minister of Foreign Affairs did not deny, though he attempted to excuse it by explaining that M. Kerensky was vexed at our repetition of well-known facts when he was doing his best to meet our wishes.It is generally believed [No. 1591 of the 9th, October) that the negotiations now proceeding will lead to a liquidation of the threatened general railway strike.TURKEY.The ex-Khedive [Berne No. 925 of the 10th October] has now left Vienna [and (according to the papers) been received with full honours in Constantinople]. The following are stated to be the facts for his departure from Switzerland.Negotiations lasting about two months having been conducted through the Austrian Government, the Grand Vizier wrote a fortnight ago to the effect that the Porte still recognised Abbas, as,Khedive.of Egypt, and would treat him so on his return to Constantinople, re-establish his civil list, and, should the British authorities sell his estates in Egypt, indemnify him out of the property of British subjects in Turkey to their full value. The Turks, however, from their knowledge of English procedure, were assured that the British Government would not revenge themselves in this manner on the ex-Khedive.   He would be quite safe and at liberty to travel wherever he desired.After receiving this letter,, the Khedive informed his former officials that he considered his recent negotiations with the Foreign Office had broken down. The Turkish Legation in Switzerland gave him 50,000L for his local debts, and he took with him amongst his suite Chaik Pasha, as Well as several prominent Nationalists and students. His son, stating that he was entirely on the side of England, refused to accompany him.From information from a reliable source, it appears that the Porte will only allow four lines on letters and post-cards of British prisoners, since the British Government appear to have taken similar action.
APPENDIX (A).Copy of a Memorandum from the D.D. Works, Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, to the Consulting Architect to the Government of India, Simla, No. 2404/1, dated July 7, 1910.I forward herewith copy of a letter No. 140S/6-Q, of the 3rd instant from D.A.Q.M.G., to the I.G.C., M.E. Force, regarding a mosque which it is desired to construct at Basra as early as practicable.As I am very short of officers and have no one of the necessary experience to supervise the construction of this building, I shall be very greatly obliged if you will arrange in due course for the deputation of an officer for this purpose.2. As will be seen from my letter (enclosed) to the Principal of the Mayo School of Art the drawings have not been completed, and this officer will, no doubt, inform you when the time has arrived to depute the architect to this country.3. The officer who constructs the mosque will also be asked to undertake the construction of a gurudwara designed by the consulting architect to the Government of Bombay.Copy of a Memorandum from the D.A.Q.M.G., Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, to the Inspector-General, Communications, No. 1408/6/(3, dated July 1, 1916.In reply to your No. 504/8/L.C, dated the 9th June, I beg herewith to return the plans in question, and to say that the Army Commander approved of the design furnished by Lahore School of Art, as being the type to which our Indian troops are accustomed.In regard to the opinion of the C.P.O., I am to remark that possibly it has not been made clear to him that for political reasons of our own connected with the Mohammedan soldiers of Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, it is considered most desirable to erect a mosque which shall be placed in the charge of Indian Maulvies. That being so, the fact whether local Arab Mohammedans approve of the mosque or its architecture would seem not to affect the matter. In any case, the Arab Commander does not propose to have the mosque erected for the benefit of Arab Mussulmans, seeing that they have a sufficiency of their own mosques in Basra.I am now to ask that you will take the necessary steps to select a suitable site either at Ashar or Makina. In this connection, it appears that the Honourable Captain Malik Sir Umar Hayat Khan strongly favours Ashar in preference to Makina, and I am to request that you consult him in regard to the question of site.From a recent interview with, that officer, the D.D. Works is of opinion that it will be necessary to get an Indian architect from the Punjab to superintend the work of erection, and further possibly enquire into the importation of materials.In view of the fact that the Army Commander, due to political consideration, is most anxious that the siting and subsequent erection of this mosque should be taken in hand as soon as possible, I am to ask that the matter generally may receive your early attention.Copy of a Memorandum from the D.D. Works, Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, to the Principal, Mayo School of Lahore, No. 2403/1, dated July 7, 1916.I am much obliged for the design of a mosque submitted with your No. 865 of the 12th May, and have pleasure in informing you that it has been approved by the Army Commander.2. I return the pencil drawings and request that you will kindly complete them and have tracings made.3. The only bricks we have here are 9&quot; X 9&quot; X 2&quot; and 10&quot; X 10&quot; X 2-i&quot; ; they are of a very porous nature, but have proved sufficiently strong for use in double-storeyed buildings.4. The soil here is poor for foundations, with water close up to the surface. For foundations, on concrete we do not allow more than 0&apos;6 ton per sq. foot; it may there-fore be necessary to use piles for your building.5. The consulting architect to the Government of Tndia is being asked to depute an officer to supervise the construction.
Copy of a Letter from Fakir Muhammad Abdul Bari, Lucknow, to His Excellency the C omma,nder-in-Chief, dated January 30, 1917.May it please your Excellency.With due respects I beg to bring to.your Excellency&apos;s kind notice that the Mussulmans have learnt, with deepest shock and distress, the news that a &quot; Guru Gate&quot; is about to be built in Basra. According to Islam, the land of the Arabs, which is bounded by the Euphrates, the Tigris, the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean, is a holy ground, and we are enjoined by our Prophet to keep the sacred soils immune from the least taint of pagan and idolatrous practices.The only thing we can do is to draw the attention of the Great Britain, with an earnest prayer, to issue a public proclamation protecting the Arab land on the western bank of the Tigris from desecration and outrage. Trusting to our steadfast loyalty and sense of justice of our rulers, we hope that our prayer will be granted, and the Great Britain and her Government will not forget those traditions of absolute religious neutrality and fair play which have been their pride and glory.Hoping to be excused for this intrusion and trusting that your Excellency will consider over the matter as it deserves.The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India to Major-General Sir P. Z. Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bagdad.(No. 169 W/C.   Confidential.)Sir, Simla, August 6, 1917.I am directed to inform you that the Government of India in the Army Department have had under consideration a proposal received through the D. D. Works, Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, for the erection of a mosque and a Sikh gurudwara in Basra for the use of the troops. ^2. Designs and estimates were called for, and according to these the cost of the mosque&apos; is estimated roughly at 45,400 rupees, and that of the gurudwara at 36,000 rupees. In view of their traditionally neutral attitude in religious matters, the Government of India were unable to consider a proposal that the buildings should be provided from Government moneys, and the ruling chiefs were approached informally on the subject, with the result that donations amounting to 30,500 rupees have been received from Mohammedan States towards the building of the mosque, and donations amounting to 11,000 rupees have been received from the Faridkot Durbar, Kalsia Durbar, and State public towards the building of a gurudwara.3. While there is presumably no objection to the erection of another mosque in Basra on behalf of the Indian troops, the case may be different with regard to the erection of a Sikh gurudwara more especially as Basra appears to have no permanent Sikh community. On the other hand there are presumably several non-Moslem places of worship in the much more sacred city of Bagdad, and it is possible, there-fore, that the potential Moslem feeling in regard to the proposed Sikh gurudwara at Basra may be overrated. In any case it would seem impolitic to return the donations to the Durbars, and if the permanent erection of a gurudwara at Basra is held to be objectionable the money might perhaps be appropriately and unobjectionably devoted to the provision of temporary conveniences for the spiritual needs of our Sikh troops, in the shape of shamianas or otherwise. But the Government of India would be glad to have your views on the whole subject.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your most obedient Servant.DENYS BRAY, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.
APPENDIX (B).The Armenian Question and the Liberation of Armenia.1. It will not be possible to leave Armenia under the Turkish yoke after the war; upon the day of victory the task of liberating her will force itself upon the Allies. After the prolonged martyrdom, the frightful sufferings, the forced conversions, the rapes, the massacres, and the deportations of an entire Christian people, the Allied Powers, which are fighting for the liberation of oppressed peoples, will assuredly not allow Armenia to remain under the domination of her oppressors. And in this they will be guided not solely by humanitarian principles, but equally by the desire to ensure future peace to this region of perennial anarchy. For so long as these populations remain under the Turkish domination they will be a source of abuses, disturbances, and conflicts which will necessarily involve fresh intervention on the part of the Powers. It is therefore imperative to provide the Armenian question with a definite and practicable solution.2. In 1913, at the time of the Balkan wars, the Armenians applied to the Signatory Powers of the Treaty of Berlin, as well as to -Turkey herself, to request that the reforms promised under article 61 of this Treaty should be carried into execution. They entertained at that time no separatist aspiration of any kind, confining themselves to a demand for the carrying out of the reforms which would grant them equality before the law and security for their property and for their existence. They had received satisfaction by the Reforms Act of the 8 th February, 1914 ; and the Armenian question would not exist to-day had not the Porte from the very outset of the European War, and even before Turkey had entered the conflict, torn up this new agreement and dismissed the two inspectors-general who by arrangement with the Powers had been engaged to put the reforms into execution.To-day, therefore, there can of necessity no longer be question of mere reforms, ancl no solution is possible other than the deliverance of the Armenians from the Ottoman domination.3. On the other hand, since the change of regime in Russia, and since the new Government has declared itself to be opposed to all conquest, the Armenian question has necessarily undergone a change, and the national delegation has been compelled to modify its programme.Up to the present time the delegation has found it impossible to adopt a programme that could be clearly and unvaryingly defined, the solution of the Armenian question depending primarily upon the turn that events might take and upon the agreements at which the Allies might arrive on the subject of Turkey in Asia. It was thus that the delegation was led to consider a variety of solutions, which, apart from arrangements of detail, could be reduced to two principal headings, the first of which allowed for the division of Armenia into two parts, while the second united all the Armenian territories in Turkey, from the frontier of the Caucasus and of Persia to the Mediterranean, into one single State, with a view to forming an autonomous integral Armenia.The first of these solutions which was mainly inspired by the immemorial policy of the Russian Government and by the condition of affairs created by the conquest and occupation of important regions of Turkish Armenia by the Russian army allowed for the annexation of a part of Armenia by Russia. This solution is, moreover, in conformity with the convention, relating to Turkey in Asia that was drawn up between France, England, and Russia, which determined the fate of Armenia by dividing it between Russia and France, apportioning the three vilayets of Erzeroum, Van, and Bitlis to the former, and the three other vilayets, together with Cilicia, to the latter.*4. The other solution would be that of creating an integral autonomous Armenia, neutralised ancl protected by one or several Powers.After the Russian revolution the Provisional Government and the Soviet formally declared that they refused to recognise the treaties passed by the Czarist regime and that they rejected any idea of conquest or annexation.   Should this decision he* As a matter of fact, the division contemplated in the Convention does not accurately follow the boundaries of the vilayets as they exist to-day. These boundaries are artificial, the Turkish Government having established them in arbitrary fashion by attaching to the vilayets districts populated exclusively by Mussulmans, with the object of reducing the Armenian element to a minority[898-64] E
adhered to, the Convention of 1916 would fall of itself, Russia having renounced the advantages which the Convention had allotted to her; and consequently there could no longer be any question of the first solution, which divided Armenia into two parts. But, on the other hand, M. Kerensky has recently declared that with regard to &quot; the question of treaties signed with the allies, the Government considers itself as engaged in honour to respect the treaties with England and France.&quot; There would, then, appear to be an adjustment in the foreign policj7 of Russia, at all events with reference to treaties, and the Convention of 1916 would, in consequence, seem likely to be maintained. In any case, if, in the terrible crisis through which Russia is now passing, her policy of yesterday does not seem to be that of to-day, it may become that of to-morrow. And if, finally, the Convention of 1916 were to be maintained and the Armenian territories to be divided into two, it is, needless to say, with perfect confidence that we should await from France the fulfilment of her generous under-taking to grant to Cilicia and the three occidental vilayets a wide autonomy under her protection. . .&quot;With regard to the three vilayets of Erzeroura, Bitlis, and Van, which, by this solution, should revert to Russia, and which the Government of the Czar had determined to annex simply and solely by establishing colonies of Circassians, we need fortunately no longer fear similar measures from the new Revolutionary Government. The declaration of M. Terestchenko on the question of the nationalities of Russia, and the promise given by M. Kerensky, in the course of an interview, to grant to Armenia an autonomy under Russian protection, are our sure guarantees that our compatriots of Turkey would enjoy a democratic regime of liberty.It is, moreover, possible that Russia, in taking the three vilayets under her exclusive protection, would desire to join them to the Armenian region of the Caucasus, with a view to uniting under one single rule the populations of the same nationality in Russia. This being so, there would, in effect, be two autonomous Armenias, the one protected by Russia and the other by France. &apos; -5. It remains to consider the second solution, that of an integral autonomous Armenia.It is essential to make no mistake as to the meaning here attached to the word &quot; integral,&quot; which is intended to apply solely to the Armenian territories of Turkey in Asia, to the exclusion of those of Persia and Russia. There can, indeed, be no question of the Armenians of the Caucasus, who are Russian subjects, existing in full prosperity and asking no better than to remain Russian, and who, equally with with the other peoples of Russia, will profit in complete security&apos;&apos; and in full freedom by the benefits of the new regime.As for Turkish Armenia, which alone now concerns us, one sole point remains in suspense : that of knowing if she will be protected by a single Power or by several Powers. It will be the Peace Congress that will have to solve this problem, as this will be bound to come to a definite determination. What, indeed, will be done with Armenia? It is not enough to set her free; she must also be allowed to live, and be guarded from outside attacks, so that she shall run no risk of becoming once more the prey of the Turks.   To this end she must be protected.    Who will protect her ?It is by no means certain, after the exceedingly plain statements made by the members of the Provisional Government, that Russia would assume this protection, and we think that this r6le should fall to France by actual virtue of the Entente of 1916, the various obligations whereof will undoubtedly be respected by England and France, notwithstanding the renunciation of Russia.It may, however, be foreseen that by reason of the international interests at stake in these countries of the Near East, the Powers will agree together to take under their collective protection the future autonomous integral Armenia, which would, as a fact, be the equivalent of neutralisation.This last solution, which would accord better than any other with the aspirations of the Armenians, and would at the same time harmonise with the war aims of the Allies, who have proclaimed the principle of nationalities and the liberation of oppressed peoples, consists in the union of all the Armenian territories in Turkey, that is, Cilicia and the six vilayets of Erzeroum, Bitlis, Van, Diarbekir, Mamouret-el-Aziz, and Sivas.An Armenia thus constituted would extend from the Russian and Persian frontiers to the Mediterranean, with, the ports of Mersina and Alexandretta, which are her natural outlets, and which alone would render it possible for the Armenians to rebuild their national life, by the commercial and economic development of their country.6. The advantages of this solution are manifold. It is needless to mention those relating to the Armenians, which are self-evident.   But with regard to the Powers, it
will be enough to say that such an Armenia, placed under a collective protection, with equality of rights for the Powers, would become an open field for their commercial, economic, and scholastic activity. They would be enabled to develop their schools and to spread the knowledge of their language and of their culture, while at the same time finding a use for their capital in the development of a vast country of very great natural richness. This Armenia would form, moreover, a real buffer between the future Turkish Empire of Anatolia, Russia, Persia, and the future autonomous States which the Powers may have to create at the end of the war. She would thus, by removing all risks of direct conflict, become an element of pacification.The advantages would be no less from the standpoint of the Bagdad Railway, which by this solution would gain, in the ports of Alexandretta and Mersina., rail-heads in neutral territory, which would liberally ensure to all the Powers the traffics of Persia and of India. This solution would at the same time provide the most effective bar to the hold of Germany over Turkey east of the Taurus, and to the &quot; Drang nach Osten &quot; of the pan-Germans.7. It is, however, necessary to.point out that the collective protection of the Allies would not take the form of a Condominium, a form which would certainly not be favourably received by the Chanceries. We are aware, indeed, of the prejudice which diplomatists feel against collective protections, and the failure&apos; of the Condominium formerly established in Egypt is not calculated to induce them to repeat the experience. But the collective protection, to be granted to Armenia would have nothing in common with such a Condominium. In Egypt, France and England did not limit their r61e to a plain protection ; they took an active and direct part both in the government and in the administration of the interior in all its branches; there existed side by side English and French officials who directed all the administrative wheels and interfered with the smallest details. It was difficult to avoid friction, which rendered all government impossible. To the great detriment of the country, this daily contact created rivalries and heart-burnings, which, compromised the friendly relations of the occupying Powers. But it would be quite otherwise with the collective protection that would be granted to Armenia. The function of the protecting Powers would be limited to the elaboration by general agreement of a statute or constitution for the new autonomous State, and, this being done, the appointment of a Governor-General charged with its application. They might, moreover, with a view to facilitating at the outset this task of simple superintendence, delegate for a transition period one of themselves, providing him with a mandate to create the various administrative services and to apply the statute. This mandate would be temporary and given for a definite term, that is until the day when autonomous Armenia would be capable of governing herself by means of her own indigenous material. This mandatory Power would perform the office of a genuine tutor, or rather of a trustee, and would retire at the expiration of its mandate, as the United States have done in Cuba. There would, moreover, be nothing to hinder the appointment of two mandatory Powers, whereof the one would be France for Cilicia and the occidental vilayets, and. the other Russia for the three oriental vilayets which she now actually occupies.As for the r61e of the protecting Powers, it would be no other than that which they have filled in the case of Greece, where France, England, and Russia, who founded the kingdom nearly a century ago, had no need to interpose or interfere until the day when the King violated the Constitution. Their intervention was then sufficient to restore complete order. This collective protection would, moreover and above all, have the advantage of distributing among all the Powers the responsibility of this protection, and of annulling-so to speak its risks, since none of them would be tempted to violate the neutrality of Armenia, knowing that it would encounter all the remaining Powers united to resist it. This would be, in brief, a reduction on a very small scale of the future Society of Nations.8. It is advisable to refute in advance the argument used by the Turks in their press to combat every project of autonomy. They wish it to&apos;be believed that there are not sufficient Armenians left in Turkey to constitute an autonomous nation. This argument is merely specious.Before the war the Armenian population of the Turkish Empire had risen to about 2,100,000. In this total the population of Cilicia counted for 407,000; and that of the six vilayets for 1,163,000. In the six vilayets, where are to be found the bulk of the Kurdish population and a great diversity of races, the Armenians were none the less in the majority, mounting up to 40 per cent, of the total, and they were, moreover, more numerous than the Turks and the Kurds together.If, on the other hand, one takes the standpoint of economic and moral importance,
it is proved that the Armenians covered from 69 to 86 per cent, of the commerce, the industries, and the various jDrofessions. Their schools, which are all at the exclusive charge of the commonalties, represented more than 80 per cent, of the total.Finally, the Armenians, who only figured as 2,100,000 in the Empire&apos;s settled population of 16,000,000, had.in their hands 60 per cent, of the import trade, 40 per cent, of the export trade, and more than 80 per cent, of the home trade.In spite of the great number of the victims of the massacres and deportations, the greater proportion of the Armenians have succeeded in escaping or surviving the work of extermination. It must not be forgotten, on the other hand, that the number of Armenians in the whole world exceeds 4,000,000, and that a large number of those who, flying from the persecutions, have emigrated during the last thirty years to Europe, to Egypt, and to America will hasten to return to their motherland on the day that autonomy assures to them a life of peace and of labour, under the laws of justice and of liberty. It is, moreover, known that there were barely 400,000 Greeks in Greece when the kingdom was founded, and 600,000 to 700,000 Serbs or Bulgars when Serbia and Bulgaria were raised to principalities.9. It must not be forgotten that the Turkish and Kurdish peoples have themselves been reduced in very high proportions by losses due to the war, by privations, and by epidemics. Their number will be still further reduced in the future, since it will be imperative that a Commission of Inquiry be instituted, similar to those that will operate in Belgium and the invaded countries, to fix responsibility and to denounce to the regular tribunals all who have participated in the massacres. The expulsion from Armenia of all the undesirables recognised as guilty by the tribunals will then be inevitable.10. The Allies would also not suffer that, even should the Armenians prove at the outset to be in a minority, the authors of the massacres should draw any advantage or profit from a majority due to the shedding of blood. For, according to the eloquent words of M. Paul Doumer, when the&apos; Peace Congress comes to the apportionment of Armenia and of the other countries -which like herself have been bent beneath the yoke, it will count not only what remains of the living, but it will also count the dead.It will therefore be no more possible to make the future of Armenia dependent on a factitious majority than the Allies would admit in the case of Alsace-Lorraine.11. &quot;We must add, finally, that the autonomy that we claim would not be granted for the benefit of the Armenian people alone, but would profit equally all the populations inhabiting Cilicia and the six vilayets. The Turks and the Kurds as well as the Armenians would benefit under the rule of liberty, security, and justice which autonomy would be called upon to guarantee. The Mussulman people, subject to-day as throughout the Ottoman Empire to a barbarous administration under which they themselves suffer, far from receiving injury to their interests, would reap nothing but advantage, seeing that autonomy would bring them equality of treatment and impartial justice.12. To sum up, whichever of the solutions outlined in this note may prove to be the one adopted at the Peace Congress, it will free Armenia from her oppressors and be hailed with gratitude by the Armenians, who will at last see opening before them an era of security, -peace, and justice, under the aegis of the Allied Powers.(The Pasha wishes to correct a sentence in the above.   He had that &quot; Allthe Powers would have the free use of the Bagdad railway both in peace and in war.&quot; It would be more exact to say that in war time there would be no question of anything but purely commercial traffic, the transport of troops or material of war being prevented by the fact that the railway would traverse neutral territory ; further, this prohibition would in no way injure England, which would have at her disposal the Haiffa line.)PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C.

ARABIA.Hejaz.Intelligence.Major Davenports party, with Sherif Shaker and about 1,000 Arabs and four guns, left Abu Markha on August 28 and marched via Bir Amr and Bedawi to Bir Ain Turaa, where three Arab deserters came in from Abu Naam. On the night of September 1 they halted six miles west of Abu Naam station, and early on the following morning Major Davenport began laying charges on a bit of curved railway south of Abu Naam. The work was interrupted by a heavy fire from the south and from hills to the east, but the charges laid were fired and about .500&apos;rails and three miles of telegraph line were destroyed. An Egyptian officer and seven men were missing, while the Arabs captured about thirty Turks and killed twelve. Next day a party of Arabs completed the demolition of the big curve which the railway makes at this point; it is hoped that these curved rails are irreplaceable. The prisoners taken were ravenously hungry, and stated that they received only a water-bottle of water and one small loaf per day. Some of them believed that supplies are being carried to Medina from Syria, every fortnight, by an aeroplane as big as a train and resembling a &quot; huge cigar,&quot; which-one prisoner professed to have seen.Sherif Zeid, with artillery and Syrian troops, has arrived at Yambo en route for Akaba.An enemy aeroplane visited Akaba on September 7 and dropped three bombs, but no damage was done.The enemy have attacked Wadi Musa, but are reported to have been repulsed by the Arabs, who killed forty Turks and themselves lost eleven. Sherif Nasir is said to have gone to Wadi Musa, where the lurks are likely to .make another attack. They are alarmed by the anti-Turkish movement among the Arabs of this region and are doing all in their power to prevent it from spreading northwards.Further details have been received of the recent bombing raids carried out by the R.F.C. in the Maan area (see last Bulletin, p. 369). Thirty-two bombs were dropped at Maan on August 28. The station and adjoining buildings were hit many times, eight bombs falling directly on the engine sheds. One bomb hit the Railway inspectors house, and four fell within fifty yards of the aeroplane hangars. An enemy machine was seen-on the aerodrome but did not rise. No bombs were dropped east of the railway, as the Turkish hospital is situated there. Our machines returned safely, though hit in many places by machine-gun fire and shrapnel.On August 29 seventy-four bombs were dropped on the Turkish camps at Fuweilah and Abu el-Lissan with good results.
The greatest confusion was caused, and a direct hit was obtained on a field battery. Our three machines were again subjected to intense rifle, machine-gun ancl shrapnel fire and were all hit.Several Syrian notables have arrived at Sherif FeisaFs Caulp at Akaba, among them being Emir Abd el-Kacler el-Jezalri and Omar ancl Faiz, sons of Ali Pasha el-Moayyacl. The latter is of; the influential Damascus family of El-Aziu, part of which is pro-Turk and part pro-Arab. Omar and Faiz escaped sometime ago from Broussa and organized a baud of brigands to harrass the Turks round Damascus. Emir Abd el-Kacler is one of the three sons of Ali Pasha Jezairi, who was President of the Chamber of Deputies at Constantinople and deputy for Damascus. His father was the famous Abd el-Kader of Algeria.The Egyptian Mahiual has arrived at Jeddah on its way to Mecca.The Situation at Akaba.The following notes are taken from a report by Captain Macindoe, M.C., dated August 27 : A hostile Turkish force operating from Maan would have to approach Akaba by either the northern road or the eastern road.The northern road runs through easy country from Maan to Delagha. From Delagha to Gharandel there is a narrow and winding defile for some sixteen miles to be traversed, but as soon as the Wadi Araba, is reached, the road becomes easy for any body of troops with a camel transport, but not for wheeled transport, as there is very soft sand. There is also a plentiful water supply, even at this time of the year.The eastern road runs through eas)&apos; country from Maan to Fuweilah, and not difficult from Fuweilah to Gueira ; but from six miles this side of the latter place it runs through the narrow gorges and defiles of Wadi ftm, which would be exceedingly difficult of passage in the face of organized opposition. Water is obtainable at Fuweilah for a force of 3,000 men and animals, and at Gueira  or 500 men ancl animals, but there is no water between the two places. From Gueira to Akaba there are small wells in side valleys easy to defend. It must be borne in mind, however, that in two or three months&apos; time water might be pkmtrful every-where.The troops at Akaba consist of some 2,000 so-called regular troops under the command of Gaafar Pasha. They consist of 1,600 infantry, divided into two regiments, the north and the south regiments, 300 cavahy ancl camel corps, and 150 artillery.Gaafar Pasha is proceeding with the training, and the men do a little company drill, but I think he quite realizes that it would be useless putting them up against anything like au equal body of trained Turkish troops with any hope of success.
Something, however, might be made of them in time, especially the cavalry (mule and camel), machine gunners and artillery, as long as they are not asked to fight any pitched battle with the Turk, but are used entirely as irregulars, and. only for minor operations.Pilgrim Accommodation at Jeddah.There are about 200 houses in Jeddah which accommodate pilgrims. A. quarter of these houses are known as &quot; Wakalas &quot;, and are vacant except in the pilgrim season, when they are let out to &quot; Wakils&quot; and &quot; Mutawafs&quot; for the sole purpose of housing pilgrims.The &quot;Wakalas&quot; are mostly situated in. the Yemen quarter of the town and can take in about 10,000 pilgrims. They are the property of the King of the Hejaz, of members of his family, of the Zawa. Zeid Ashraf family, of Mohammed Nassif, the King&apos;s agent at Jeddah, and of other wealth)7 merchants in the Hejaz. Tlie largest of them is owned by the King himself, and can accommodate about 2,000 pilgrims when tightly packed.The nominal price; for pilgrim accommodation was fixed by the Turkish Government at P.T. 2 a day for the first three days and P.T. 1 for subsequent days, and this was approved by a com-mittee appointed by the King in August, 1916. It is generally admitted, however, that a pilgrim is lucky if he gets off with P.T. 10 for a night&apos;s lodging.Nearly all the large private houses facing the harbour and many in the Yemen quarter are built, with spare rooms for lodgers, and the tenants endeavour to obtain the whole of the yearly rent, often amounting to  150, in the few weeks of the pilgrim season.In addition to these houses there are several free houses called &quot;rubats,&quot; which have been built and are maintained as &quot; waqfs.&quot; In the Yemen quarter there are three &quot; rnbats &quot; for Bokharis and two for Indians.The Mutawafs who live in Mecca have their representatives in Jeddah. Wakils of the Javanese, Indians, Bokharis and others are always in residence there, and are well-known citizens of the place. They, in turn, have their deputies who travel back with the pilgrims to their own countries, remain there preaching the duty of visiting the Holy Places, beat up recruits for the next pilgrimage and return with them to Jeddah. Each man, as he lands, will find that accommodation has been arranged for him either by the deputy on board or the Wakil on the landing stage, and if by any chance he evades these he will soon be picked up by another Wakil in the town.
MESOPOTAMIA.Suq el-Shuyukh Tribal Affairs.The following notes are taken from the Administration Report of the Assistant Political Officer, Suq el-Shuyukh : Stiq is to Khamisiyah as Basrah is to Zubair. The chief trade is done in Suq, whilst Rbamisiyah is the gate into the desert. Khamisiyah, in other words, may be looked upon as the Khan for caravans coming from, Hail and Central Arabia to purchase goods from Suq. At one time, before the marshes existed between the desert belt and Suq (i.e. some fifty years ago), camel caravans used to come right up to Suq, as also clidthe big escorting companies of Ibn Rashid who annually conducted the Haj from Suq to Mecca,, in those days Ibn Khamis was the recognized leader of the Niijd community of merchants who made Suq their headquarters. The big marshes having formed between Suq and Khamisiyah, Ibn Khamis transferred a. portion of the Najdi population to the far side of the marshes to what is now known as Khamisiyah and built a sort of bridgehead there ; to-day caravans put up in Khamisiyah, while goods are sent out from Suq, by boat in summer and donkey in winter. The arrangement suits the desert man well, especially as he avoids the Surra fly area, in the vicinity of Suq, which used to kill off many of his camels annually.From the date of the capture of Kut, the attitude of Suq tribes has undergone a, marked change for the better1. It is too early to say whether ibis change is only a temporary one or not. Open hostility to us, I fancy, they will put away for good, as they are quite shrewd enough to realize that, whoever holds Baghdad holds Iraq. There still remains, however, to be dealt with the innate hostility felt towards any form of government by the average Arab. This will have to be gradually removed by whoever is A.P.O. during the next few years, and also by the process of education. I nere appear to be several causes for this rather pardonable state of mind. First we. have the bad govern-raent of the Turks before us, the tyranny of the Saaduu before them, and lastly the fact that, they, the tribes, have tasted the sweets of almost complete freedom from any sort of government restraint for the last fifteen years or so. The fact that no rice,&apos; da,te or wheat revenue has been paid for many years to the Turks has had its effect, especially on the younger generation of tribes-men, who are in consequence arrogant, conceited and boastful. Their arguments are crude but. logical, and are something as follows :  Firstly, &quot; No Government&quot; means that we retain crops or money which would otherwise be taken from us in the form of revenue. Secondly, we retain lauds from which we have ejected the rightful, owners, therefore we have to pay no &quot; mallakiyah &quot;
(rent) to anyone, and have gained and possess good rice lands for nothing. Thirdly, we exist and are prepared to defend ourselves by right of our strong arm, always a popular form of existence among savages.The above is more or less the argument of the young braves ; the wiser and older heads, on the contrary, believe in the English and especially in their ability to rule, and look for great things from us. Possibly7 they expect too much ; they dream dreams, and are for ever talking about the great railways, ships, canals, irrigation schemes, hospitals, schools, etc., etc., that we shall introduce. As is natural, however, the)7 apply things to them-selves and are already beginning to wonder what immediate changes will most affect their own lands and crops. They realize that one of the first things that we British will enforce will be the proper payment of revenue. They fully understand that this must come, and all agree as to the justice of it. Doubtless they will endeavour to put off the evil day as long as possible, but, beyond a little bluff, such&apos; as attempting to prevent trees being counted etc., I do not think there should be any difficulty in gathering in a. full revenue in about two years from now.NOTES.Abyssinian News. &quot;\Despatches from Adis Abeba show that the position of the Regent, in the weeks preceding the defeat of Lij Yasu on August 27 [see p. 377), Avas becoming increasingly precarious.In the middle of August Fitaurari Hapta Giorgis was still at Dessie, while Lij Yasu was at Amba Sel some thirty miles to the north-east. The Government ordered Dejaz Igazu to take a force northwards to support the Fitaurari, but Igazu flatly refused to do so. This was the second instance within, a month of a leading chief refusing to obey7 the orders of the Central Govern-ment, the previous offender being Dejaz Kabada. Ras Taffari&apos;s prestige was being further undermined by the intrigues of Queen Taitou [see p. 37), Dejaz Igazu and Fitaurari Telahoun with the Empress, with which he was powerless to deal.A rising in Tigre under the leadership of Hailu Mariam is reported to have been crushed by Ras Seyyum&apos;s troops under the latter&apos;s son, Dejaz Kassa. Near Goba in the Arussi country (see p. 150.), the province of Dejaz Bajena, the Abyssinians have successfully repulsed a night attack by the Moslems, both sides suffering heavy casualties. The Moslems were led by7 Mohammed Yusuf who, earlier in the year, was reported from Nairobi as a fanatic who was preaching the. Jehad in Southern Abyssinia and proclaiming the coming of a. new Mahdi.
It is reported from Aden that the German Mission from Adis Abeba (see p. 375), which was presumably attempting to reach Arabia, lias been captured in French Somali land and taken to Jibuti.South- Western Arabia.Reports from the Yemen show that the unrest among the Zeidi tribesmen is not abating.The revolt in the Ibb region is headed by three Bekil Sheikhs, Abu Harb, Kaid ibn Itageb (p. 202) and Yahya ibn Yahya esh Shaif (p. 355), and by Sayed Mohammed Hassan (p. 367). Sayed Mohammed is said to have lost influence by his present action, and his Taiz followers recently broke oft&apos; relations with hi in on the ground that he had joined the Zeiclis against, the Government. These leaders, with at least 3,000 men, have taken ti].) positions on Jebels Ras, Baadan and Meerah. They are opposed by Elias Bey with some local irregulars, about 300 Millah Arab troops, 150 Turks with some guns, and the followers of Moham-mecl Nasir Mnqbil and Ibn Ahmed Naaman. Up to the present nothing beyond a few skirmishes appears to have taken place  in one of which Yahya ibn Yahya esh Shaif was slightly wounded  though there is an unconfirmed rumour that fbb has been captured from the Turks. Local native opinion considers that the Zeiclis can do nothing beyond occupying the attention of the Turks, since there is no religious incentive ,to induce others to join them, and they lack a, -eommon. leader and are unable to obtain supplies from outside.Meanwhile the Imam has been doing what he can to stop hostilities. He is said to have joined the Vali in issuing a pro-clan tation calling on the people of Yemen to defend themselves and their country from the Zeidi rebels. He also recently sent Seyyid Mohammed ibn Yusuf Said ill Islam to the Dhu Hussein, offering $ 13,000 as a ransom for the murder of Abu Ras and certain territorial priviledges. He ordered them to cease fighting, as otherwise he would consider they were fighting, not the Turks but himself, and would send a, force against them. It is also stated that, at, the instigation of the Turks, he is preventing the Arabs of Radii from coming to Aden.Some interesting correspondence has come into the hands of the Resident, Aden, from Jeizan. Sheikh Ahmed ibn Ahmed esh Shaif. of the Gliazeilari section of the Dim Mohammed, wrote to the Imam that he had tried to keep his people from joining the infidels (i.e. the British), but that to do so he needed his stipend, due Imam&apos;s reply, written on the back of the letter, was a curt, refusal. He added, that he did not, believe anyone would join them, that he who is a. friend of them is one of them, and he who fights for them is worse. This letter was written eight days before his letter to Aden, in which he proposed an agreement with us.
The Zeidis are said to be still in possession o  Juban, Nawa and Rubiatein (see p. 305).An attempt by Sheikh Mohammed Nasir Muqbil to canvass recruits  or the Turks in the Radfati district through Sheikh Muqbil Abdullah, who had with him $1,000, only resulted in the collection o  thirty men.Out of: seventy . Turks and eighty Somalia&apos; who were despatched recently&apos; from Lahej to Yemen, twenty-two ancl twenty-six of them respectively were killed, the Zeidis carrying away one mm and two machine  Tims.There is little to report from the Idrisi area. Nasir Mabkhut (p. 265) and Masud el-Barak, chief of the Dhu Udlirah section of the Hashid, are now at Jeizan. The Rijal el-Ma, one of the most warlike tribes of Asir, are reported to have begun operations against Ebhah under the auspices of the Idrisi.Central Arabia,.Our Agent at: Koweit, writing on June 28, reported that not more than a third of the Sham mar were at that time supporting Ibn Rashid, the remainder including the A slam and some of the Abclah having come over to our side.Qasim seems to be the main source of supply both to Hail and Medina, although Ibn Saud is known to have issued the strictest orders against trading with enemy countries across the border. His authority in Qasim is not by any means absolute; it is subject to many limitations and may be less at the present moment than for some time past. The people who count in Qasim are the traders. Any restrictions on their business imposed by Ibn Saud would be likely to drive them into the arms of Ibn Rashid. Though Ibn Rashid is weak now, there is always the chance, they think, of the Turks returning and fbn Hashid becoming top dog again. ibn Saud, too, is not everywhere popular ; the town of Buraidah is said to be against him. The men of Qasim would doubtless fight for Ibn Saud if attacked, but their loyalty, if taken outside their borders to attack Hail, is more than doubtful.In the abortive campaign.against Hail, on which Ibn Saud set forth so impressively, all the tribes owning allegiance to Riyadh were beaten up and marched to Qasim. There, whether on account of the frigid attitude of the Qasimis, their own lack o  confidence in themselves and their leader, or the temptation of finding an exceptionally good spring pasturage, Ibn Saud could accomplish nothing. Some manoeuvring took place and time was wasted in futile peace negotiations. Our Agent suspects that it was the insecurity of Ins position in Qasim which really paralysed Ibn Sands action.
J0Qasim is, then, a sort of. sieve through which from Gulf ports (mainly from Koweit) merchandise percolates to Syria, Medina and Hail. As long as this continues, our blockade will not be absolute ; the process of strangulation will be more gradual. Meanwhile our friends in Koweit and the Qasimis are making their fortunes.The only remedy appears to lie in minimising the damage by continuing to press Ibn Saud to enforce his embargo on the export of goods from Qasim.
