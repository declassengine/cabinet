SECRET.30 oAPPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT. No. LVI.Russia.THE outstanding event of the week which is not very clear!)&apos; indicated in the report is the fact that at Kief there is a Bolshevik commander, named General Muravieff, whose orders are obeyed and who enforces discipline among his troops. This is the first -indication of either leading or real authoritative action on the part of any person or organisation in Russia since the abdication of the Emperor. Hitherto all successes have been those of disintegration ; it is just possible that the Bolsheviks feel that the disintegration is now co nplete, and that the moment for action has come. In fact, that an army may be now formed which would not menace the revolution.We have no further news of the action against religion ; if the Bolsheviks proceed to violence against the Church on a large scale it will indicate that they feel re illy firm in the saddle.RoumaniaThe information regarding Ron mania should be followed closely.Turkey.The strengthening of the military party in Turkey is probably to be attributed in part to the articles written by Colonel Repington on the depletion of the British army and the divisions of councils in England, and in part to the apparent peace made between Russia and Germany. Taken together, these events would tend to put the Turkish peace party out of court for the moment. The outbreak of fresh hostilities between Russia and Germany may improve matters.Zionism.The move of the Turks and Germans is the first indication, after three months&apos; delay, of their awaking to the necessity of action. There can be no doubt that the decisions now come to are tlie result of long and violent controvers)7.M. S.February 21, 1918.

Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 17th February [No. 500] that he had just heard on very good authority that the Germans had declared the armistice at an end.Socialist Conference. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 14th February [No. 459] that it had been announced in the official journal that the central committee of the Soviet was prepared to call a conference of the internationalist socialists of the left. A delegation consisting of Nathanson, Botinoff, and Madame Kollontai were to leave for abroad. The diplomatic passports of these persons had been presented at the Embassy for a visa, which had been given ; they were described as going to Norway, Sweden, England, France, and the United States,On the 9th February there was a preliminary meeting of the representatives of the revolutionary wing of the socialist parties of different countries. During the discussion it was pointed out that it was absurd to make it a condition of attendance at the conference that delegates should renounce the &quot; Union sacree &quot; and accept the peace terms of the Russian revolutionary democracy ; the following conditions should be made: Parties and organisations to be represented should (1) agree to enter on a revolutionary struggle with their Governments to obtain immediate peace, and (2) should support the Russian revolutionary councils.[898 -83] B
The Policy of the Allies and the Soviet. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 17th February [No. 498] that there had appeared that morning in the official Soviet paper a statement that the allies, since the November revolution, had backed every cpunter-revolutionary movement in Russia ; that the Soviet Government had shown exceptional patience, but the tune had come for the allies to choose between the continuation of that policy and such co-operation as was possible between Governments so different as their own and that of the Soviets. If they chose the former they must take the consequences. That we should have to give up all support of the Don movement (which seemed in any case to have completely collapsed), Mr. Lindley added, was clear to him if the Embassy was to he of any use or even to remain in Petrograd.Ukraine.Attitude of the Allies. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on 15th February [No. 473] that M. Trotsky had laid great stress in a conversation with Mr. Lockhart on the difficult position in which he had been placed by the declaration of the Ukraine delegates that the allies had recognised the independence of the Ukraine, and that it was therefore entitled to conclude a separate peace.Mr. Lockhart had replied that he did not believe that His Majesty&apos;s Government had ever done so, and M. Trotsky had then said that he should be grateful for a com-munication from Mr. Lindlej&apos;&apos; to that effect. He had therefore instructed Mr. Lockhart to hand him a communication in French, of which the following was a translation : The British Charge d&apos;Affaires, having learnt that the attitude of his Government towards the Ukraine had given rise to misunderstandings, had the honour to inform the Commissar of Foreign Affairs that the British Government had never recognised the Ukraine as an independent state any more than it had recognised as an independent state any other province or district of the late Russian Empire. It followed that the pretensions of the delegates of the Rada at Brest to be empowered to conclude a separate peace with the Central Powers were, from the point of view of the British Government, altogether inadmissible.On the following day he telegraphed again [No. 479], saying that the Commissaries were very well pleased with his communication, but in view of the capital which was being made in Germany out of our supposed recognition of Ukraine independence, they would welcome a public statement by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Mr. Lindley recommended that such a statement should not enter into details, but should be confined to what he had stated, which had given complete satisfaction. The feeling at Smolny was for the moment far more anti-German than it had been yet, and he thought that advantage should be taken of this. Should the Germans, however, show real signs of abandoning their pretensions, negotiations would probably be resumed.The Rada,. Sir W. Townley telegraphed on i 5th February [No. 692] that a Vienna Correspondence Bureau telegram of 12th February had announced that the Ukrainian Rada had transferred the seat of government to Schitomir, the capital of Wolhynia, close to the Austrian frontier, and had established direct relations with the Austro-Hungarian Government.The Ukrainian Soviet Government. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on 14th February [No. 453] that an official statement had been made to the effect that the Soviet Government of the Ukraine, which had been established at Kharkoff, had been trans-ferred to Kieff since the dispersion of the Rada forces.Mr. Bagge.  Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Mr. Bagge on 19th February [No. 12] approving (with a special view to bringing about a reconcilitation between the Bolsheviks and the Roumanians) his keeping in touch with General Muravieff and his remaining at Kieff.Bessarabia.The Bolsheviks and the Roumanians. On the 12th February Mr. Bagge telegraphed [No. 33] that, for the purpose of expelling the Roumanians, it was proposed to&apos;send a considerable Bolshevik force to Bessarabia; but telegraphing again on the 14th [No. 34] he said that on the previous day he had received a message from Colonel Muravieff, the commander-in-chief. asking him to persuade General Coanda,
the Roumanian representative, to see him with a view to settling the dispute. General I Coanda had agreed, and the meeting had taken place on the 14th. The General, at the request of Colonel Muravieff, was accompanied by Mr. Bagge, who explained that he was not there in any official capacity, though he should be glad to do what he could to bring about a settlement and to communicate anything to the British Minister at Jassy.Colonel Muravieff said that he regarded the presence of Roumanian forces iu Bessarabia as interference in Russian internal affairs; he was anxious to avoid bloodshed, but this could not be tolerated. He demanded the immediate evacuation of Bessarabia, and said that he was already concentrating two armies for acting against the Roumanians on the Bessarabian front; if there were war it would be ruthless, it would be regarded as a civil war, not as war with a foreign enemy. Whilst demanding the immediate evacuation of the Roumanian troops, he, on his side, would guarantee that there should be no interference by Russia in Roumanian internal affairs, that all conventions regarding supplies should be executed, that all Roumanian depots in Russia should be guarded, and that payment should be made for any damage done.to property in such depdts. Colonel Muravieff said that he would send his terms in writing to General Coanda, whose hand he shook on parting, expressing his earnest desire for a peaceful settlement. Mr. Bagge expressed the opinion that the only course open was to settle on these terms.POLAND.Dissatisfaction with the Ukrainian Peace Terms. Sir W. Townley telegraphed from The Hague [No. 684] on the 14th February that the Polish Government had resigned because of the frontiers given to Ukrainia. In Cracow and other places in Galicia black flags had been hoisted. The &quot; Kolnische Zeitung&quot; of the 14th February, said : &quot; Great was the sensation caused in parliamentary circles by the conclusion of peace with Ukrainia. All parliamentary groups except the Poles expressed their lively satisfaction at this first success gained Iry the resolute and sincere will for peace of the Central Powers. The Ukrainians rejoiced loudly at the assignation to them of the Ukrainian portion of Cholmer Land (?);.... a circumstance which had raised violent opposition on the part of the Poles.&quot;Great Britain and Poland. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Mr. Lindley on the 16th February [No. 268] that the Polish National Committee had been informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not recognise the peace concluded by Ukrainia with the Central Powers, and that it would not, without previous consultation with Poland, recognise any peace involving that country.ROUMANIA.The New Cabinet.- Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 12th February [No. U9J that the oath had been taken by the new cabinet on the preAuous day. General Averescu, the Prime Minister, would act as Minister for Foreign Affairs ; the Minister of War in the late Government retained his office, though he was a thorough pacifist; for the most part the rest were persons of no consequence.The Prime Minister and a Separate Peace. Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 14th February [No. 153] that he had had a conversation with the Prime Minister, in the course of which he had reminded him of the declarations made to his predecessor in regard to a separate peace, and toid him that the Roumanian forces, according to the estimate of our military authorities, were invincibly superior to the opposed Austro-German troops, as he had already informed the King. Further, that it appeared from our information that the situation in Germany was certainly critical, whilst that in Austria was rapidly deteriorating. The Prime Minister had replied that he must needs be sceptical in regard to optimistic information of this kind, which in the past had so often proved to be false.General Mackensen. On the 13th February Sir G. Barclay and the other allied Ministers in Jassy telegraphed in identical terms that General Averescu bad asked General Mackensen for time to form his cabinet, and that the latter had replied that he hoped it would be done within forty-eight hours, and that he presumed that no member of the Bratiano cabinet would be included or anyone notoriously hostile to the central [898-88] B 2
empires. This insolent reply produced its effect. The King ordered that in announcing the despatch of delegates a declaration should be made that negotiations could only bo begun on the understanding that the principles in force between independent States would be respected by both sides.GREECE.Decoration for King Alexander. Lord Granville telegraphed on the 13th February [No. 149] that the Crown Prince of Serbia had conferred a decoration on the King of Greece.King Constantino. Lord Granville telegraphed on the 13th February [No. 147] that as King Constantine had originally refused to accept a pension, none had been paid up to the present; so far the matter had not been definitely settled.The Lamia Mutiny. On the 16th February Lord Granville transmitted [No. 158] a telegram from the military attache saying that eleven soldiers, three of them officers, had been shot, and that several other persons, some of them civilians, had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment.   The trials were proceeding.King Alexander and the Approaching Mobilisation. In the same telegram [No. 158] the military attache said that he had been informed that King Alexander, to influence public feeling in favour of the coming mobilisation, had offered spontaneously to make a tour in Peloponnesus.TURKEY.The Recent Conference in Berlin. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed from Berne on the 17th February [No. 243] that, according to Pandjeli Bey, then in Geneva, the object of the recent conferences in Berlin was to consider certain German proposals for the creation of commercial undertakings in Turkey and Bussia, which should continue after the war and be of such a character that the allies would be unable to supplant them. The railway system would be developed, harbours would be improved, and numerous roads would be built ; to carry out which works Turkish companies were to be forthwith formed. Enver Pasha, and the Turkish Chauvinist party had wished to free Turkey from its dependence on Germany by the creation of numerous industries, but they were soon convinced that it would take forty years to convert Turkey into an industrial country; it was in consequence decided that the primary object should be the intensifying of the output of raw materials and agricultural products.Pandjeli had come to Switzerland, Sir H. Rumbold said, to buy up as many shares as possible in the company formed to work coal mines at Heraclea on the Black Sea, in which Germany was much interested ; most of the shareholders were English and French, and the desire was to make the company Germano-Turkish.Strengthening of the Military Party. In the same telegram Sir H. Rumbold said that since the happening of recent events in Russia, the military party was gaining the upper hand. The absolute integrity of the Ottoman empire has been made a condition of peace by this party.PALESTINE.Dealings with Religious Institutions. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to General Clayton on the 14th February [No. 14] instructing him. that the Italian commandant in Jerusalem should be informed that he must act through the provisional military administration in any dealings he desired to have with ecclesiastical dignitaries or religious institutions.Count Senni and Father Dioaclevi. Sir B. Wingate telegraphed on tl^ 13th February [No. 301] that the commander-in-chief was unable to modify his decision in regard to Count Senni; but Father Dioaclevi was proceeding to Jerusalem on the following day.ZIONISM.Enemy Policy. Information has been received showing that steps are being taken by the enemy to counter our Zionist policy. Karasso, it appears, was sent to Berlin with full powers to deal with the Jewish question. At Berlin he called together the leading Jews, who appointed an advisory committee, most of the members of which
were opponents, avowed or unavowed, of Zionism. This committee recommended the formation of a chartered company with power to confer autonomy on districts inhabited by Jews anywhere in the Turkish Empire, with full control over police, municipal institutions, and their own taxation ; this company it was advised, should be on British lines, and have its headquarters in Constantinople. The scheme is said to have been approved by Talaat Pasha, who, it is further said, has promised to include it in the peace terms. Though the scheme is anti-Zionist in intention, it promises something which Turkey can grant at once.ARABIA.Nejd.Ibn Saud and King Hussein. --On the 15th February Sir P. Cox transmitted a telegram from Colonel Cunliffe-Owen at Nejd, dated the 5th February, saying that lurid accounts of their reception by the King of Hejaz had been brought back by two messengers belonging to Mr. Philby&apos;s caravan, who said that the rest of their party had been sent to Mecca by the King, who had detained them: Colonel Cunliffe-Owen gathered from a remark made by the ruler of Nejd that the attempts made to bring about co-ordination between him and the King were not altogether pleasing to himself. He did not wish to be mixed up with either Egypt or Mecca; and one result of Mr. Philby&apos;s journey had been to incline him to think that we Avere trying to conciliate King Hussein at his expense.Asik.Successes of Idrisi. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 18th February [No. 313] that it had been reported by Aden that Idrisi&apos;s troops had occupied Lolreiya* and El Atari, which had been in the possession of the Turks.SIBERIA.General Conditions. On the 13th February Mr. Lindley transmitted [No. 437] a telegram, dated the 11th February, from Mr. McGrath, at Krasnoyarsk, reporting the arrest and imprisonment in that place of the social revolutionary provisional Government of Siberia. He said that only two banks were allowed to operate, the Siberian bank, whose capital was German, and the State bank; the former for commercial and the latter for official business. Information had reached him as to the collection of raw materials, presumably for Germany, and as to the arming of the German prisoners at Omsk. His impression was that German intrigues were responsible for the situation and that steps should be taken at once unless the allies were prepared to abandon their interests in Siberia.ARMENIANational Militia. -Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Mr. Lindley on the 1.4th February [No. 248] suggesting that the latter might be able to remit funds to Titlis for the purposes of the national Armenian militia, the American delegation having brought to the notice of His Majesty&apos;s Government the Bolshevik decree of the 13th January favouring its formation.   [See Eastern Report LIII, p. 6. telegram to Boghos Pasha.]PERSIA.Closing of the Frontier and Arrest of French Officers. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 13th February [No. 10-l] that the Persian authorities, as a protest against the arming of Assyrians and Armenians, had closed the frontier against all military desiring to enter Persia, and had detained at Julfa two French officers connected with the hospital at Urumia. The general officer commanding at Tiflis proposed to demand the removal of all restrictions as to the passage of troops through Persia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that orders bad been misunderstood, and that instructions in regard thereto should be sent immediately.The Persian Cossacks. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 17th February [No. Ill] that Colonel Filaretov, the &quot;commander of the Hamadan battalion, had, by a show of force, compelled the officer commanding the division to resign. Colonel Staroselski, commander of the Teheran regiment, had taken over the command, and in turn had* On the coast, 200 miles Tiorth of Perim.
-called, upon Colonel Filaretov to resign, which the latter had agreed to do. There hud been no disturbance, but the incident was destructive of the military value of the division, and might have regrettable political results. There had been, Sir C. Marling said, talk of requesting the Russian officers fco obey the orders of the maximalist Government and return to Russia, and of placing the division under the Swedish commander of the gendarmerie. When Sir C. Marling warned the Persian Government&apos; against the commission of so foolish an act, it had argued that, after such an exhibition of indiscipline, the division might as well be under Persian officers.AFGHANISTAN.Reported Intrigues. It has been reported from a source not usually reliable (though in this case there is some evidence connecting the.report with known facts) that an agreement between the sou of the Amir and the Turkish Minister of War is in existence. The Amir (sic) wishes, the report says, to secure arms and munitions for rebel Indian tribes on the Indo-Afghan frontier. Several Turkish officers and some Germans under Colonel Hassan Bey, it also says, have passed through Persia to Afghanistan to organise hostilities against the English.[&quot; Colonel Hassan Bey is probably one of t lie two Turks, Usman and Sidik Beg, whose arrival was so anxiously awaited by Kazim Beg &quot; a year ago. &quot; One of these Turks is known to have signed himself &apos; Hassan Effeudi.&apos; &quot;]LATEST, INTELLIGENCE.RUSSIA,   aUkraine.Situation at Kieff. Mr. Bagge telegraphed on the 17th and 1.8th February [Nos.. 42, 45, and 46] that the total number of casualties in the fighting at Kieff was estimated at 5,800, in addition to which some 2,000 officers and suspects had been executed. The rumours as to an offensive against Kieff grew in strength, and a friendly warning had been received that the Austrians would be there within a week. General Muravieff had left Kieff, and there was reason for believing that he had gone east with the intention of subduing the Don.The Ultimatum to Roumania.- Mr. Bagge in the same telegrams said that the time granted to Roumania for replying to the ultimatum had been extended ; it would expire on the 23rd February. Mi&apos;. Bagge believed that Roumania had an undertaking with Austria.o
