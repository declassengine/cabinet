SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN  REPORT No. XXXV.Russia.THERE is nothing of importance to comment on in Russia this  week; the postponement of the Soviet meeting on Tuesday, the 25th, leaves everything in doubt.Germany and the Middle East.- The extracts given show that the Germans are careful to keep their Turkish policy well before the public. It is particularly interesting to observe that in a casual article on Flanders Constantinople is put only second to Berlin in strategic importance. Erzbergers references to Arabia show that this moderate Christian pacifist intends that the Turk shall rule the Arab even if some compromise is arrived at in Alsace-Lorraine.EuYPT.It is submitted that there is real danger in the Khedive&apos;s intrigues. If he came as the Francophil Governor-General of Syria we should be in a fix.Prince Fuad is brother of the preient Sultan. He has, unlike his nephew Prince Kemal-ed-Diu, taken his part in public affairs with readiness. His views are Anglophil and progressive. Prince Ke.nal-ed-Din is notoriously under the influence of his wife, who is the sister of the ex-Khedive Abbas Hdmi.M. S.September 27, 1917.

The &quot; Lokal Anzeiger&quot; goes so far as to claim victory; and &quot; Flanders Battle (so far won by us)&quot; is the heading of its Friday evening edition. In its Saturday morning edition the same paper practically accuses British Head-Quarters Reports of being faked, sarcastically remarking :  &quot; The British advance of I kilometre obviously appeared to themselves so insignificant that it was thought necessary to magnify its importance by aninvented nomenclature.....Do the English imagine that the world is so simpleas to be deceived by the stringing together of a number of names like the above into the belief that they have at last made a real advance in their march towards Berlin and Constantinople ? &quot;Attention is drawn to Erzbergers speech at Biberach, as given by the &quot; Post &quot; of the 20th September. After disclaiming all desire for peace of violation and suppression, he continues : &quot; We desire permanent reconciliation of peoples, and we are optimistic enough to believe that out of this bath of blood dawn of an age of justice is arising. We see foundation of such an era in principle that there shall be no violation of any nation. Consider how Prussian policy towards Poland brings in its revenges. Does any one believe that suppression of little Belgium will give lasting peace ? R,eichstag declines every plan for concraest, but under terms of resolution England must also renounce Africa, Arabia, and Mesopotamia.&quot;(The&quot; Post&quot; concludes that by Africa Erzberger means German Colonies in Africa.)RUSSIA.Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 1471 of the 19th September] that the American Railway Mission was now working outside Russia proper to the east of the Ural Mountains.   There were many superior Russian railway officials, but over-extensive sub-[898-62] B
division into numerous services, and corruption in lower ranks, hampered them. The failure of the railways, however, was largely due to confusion elsewhere, as well as to the unconsidered demands made both in civilian and military traffic. It seemed certain that foreign personnel, for the adequate utilisation of ports and English waterways, would be necessary next spring.On the 18th September the Minister of Foreign Affairs [No. 1472 of the 19th September] spoke to our Ambassador of the desire of the Poles for representation at the forthcoming Allied conference. The Minister had promised to include a Pole in the Russian delegation, and this had apparently satisfied Polish representations.On the same day, M. Lednicki [No. 1476 of the 20th September] assured Sir G. Buchanan that all the different parties in Poland, with the sole exception of the &quot;Internationals,&quot; were anti-German. Pie foresaw, however, the possibility of an inclination in certain quarters to look to Austria for the realisation of Polish reunion, although the Poles were well aware that in that case they would have to give up all prospect of incorporating Posen into a new Polish State, for which reason he, personally, was strongly combating any pro-Austrian league. In his opinion the confusion in Austria was so bad that she could not carry on the war many more months.On the 21st September the Minister of War (No. 1491 of the 21st September] convened the Allied military attaches, and explained to them that Korniloff&apos;s plot had completely alienated the men from the officers in the Russian army, for which reason it was necessary to make radical changes throughout the higher commands and at head-quarters. General Alexieff had therefore decided that as he had not the confidence of the men or the people, he could not undertake to reorganise the army, and that either Cherimissoff or Dukhonin would take his place. The Soviet had promised to support young officers capable of serving in high posts if only older men of the old regime were removed. Committees and commissars would have to be retained at first uutil officers had regained the confidence of the men.The second question was that of reducing the strength of the army, which was to be effected by the disbanding of sixty divisions recently formed, as also all men of 40 years and over. The danger of this device was that it would throw large numbers of men out of employment at a moment when there was no organisation existing to provide it for them. The Minister of War informed the Ambassador [No. 1492 of 21st September] that though General Korniloff&apos;s revolt would delay the reorganisation of the army by about two months, it would be carried through all the same. Discipline could not be restored merely by rifles and machine-guns, but must be implanted by-means of committees, the death penaRy only being employed as a very last resort. It was vitally necessary that the higher commands should be filled by officers possessing the confidence of the troops, and those about to be appointed would be not only young and equipped with better technical knowledge, but also in the full enjoyment of the confidence of their men.In conversation with Sir G. Buchanan [No. 1496 of 22nd September], the Minister for Foreign Affairs took a more hopeful view of the situation. Moderate elements, he&apos;said, were gaining ground in the ranks of the Soviet, and representatives of co-operative organisations were now consenting to participate in the forthcoming democratic crisis providing a large number of their representatives was raised. He doubted whether the Bolchevics would achieve any serious rising, as but few troops would respond to their appeal.ROUMANIA,Sir G. Barclay telegraphed [No. 569 of the 20th September, 1917] that M. Bratiano had received a telegram from General Alexieff to the effect that the failure of Roumanian railways might seriously impede the delivery of winter supplies to the country. In reply to this observation, General Presean stated that the chief difficulty of transport lay in the faulty working of one of the Russian sections, and suggested that this might be controlled with advantage by a committee consisting of Roumanian, Russian, French, and English representatives. His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed to the Russian Government [No. 1999 of the 24th September, 1917] that such a committee should be constituted and presided over by a Russian Minister or official.According to British railway experts in Russia, there are grave objections to the idea of a mixed international commission for any section of the Russian railway system.TURKEY.Information has been received through the United States Legation at Berne [No. 861 of the 22nd September] that a German doctor recently from Turkey expressed
his conviction that practically no prisoners of war would leave the country alive, owing to the inconceivably bad conditions. Over and above this, His Majesty&apos;s Government learn that the transmission of parcels to British prisoners of war has been suspended, except in the Smyrna Vilayet. They have therefore requested the Dutch Government to forward to the Turkish Government a strong protest. [Foreign Office to Hague No. 264 of the 24-th September.] The Porte has, meanwhile, consented to the visit of an official of the Dutch Legation for the ostensible purpose of examining the needs of the coming winter.   [Hague to Foreign Office No. 2985 of the 24th September.]The Grand Vizier [Hague No. 3013 of the 25th September] has expressed his irrevocable resolution to deport all British subjects, except women and children, from very large centres such as Smyrna and Constantinople unless Eyoub Sabri is shortly released.   They will be detained in &quot;full liberty&quot; close to the capital.ABYSSINIA.Incursions of Abyssinians [No. 62 of the 21st September] into British East Africa continue, and. Mr. Thesiger has been instructed to press Abyssinian Government to exercise all possible control in southern provinces.Conflicting reports as to Lij Yasu continue to arrive. According to the Abyssinian Government he has escaped, but it is generally believed they are concealing his death.SIAM.His Majesty&apos;s Government^ representative at Bangkok telegraphs [No. 151 of the 20th September] that, owing to the difficulties of naval transport, he has had to request India to accommodate some 300 enemy aliens.EGYPT.The french Government informed the Foreign Office on the 13th September, 1917 (No. 178992 of the 14th September, 1917), that they had learnt from a reliable source that the Ex-Khedive had decided to accept Turkish offers and.go to Constantinople. The French Government considered this a serious matter. As, however, the Ex-Khedive is equally discredited in Europe, Asia, and Africa, the Secretary of State, in thanking the French Ambassador for the information, added that he would not be inclined to view the prospect with apprehension.The news is, to a certain extent, confirmed by advices from Switzerland (No. 558 of the 1st September, 1917), to the effect that in the event of a confiscation of his property in England, the Ex-Khedive looked to the German and Austrian Governments to insure him against any loss, to grant him a pension, and to bring his claims before the Peace Conference.In view of limiting to strict necessity the amount of gold despatched to the Hejaz the Treasury have asked Sir B. Wingate (F.O. telegram No. 908 of the 20th September) to enquire into the possibility of substituting for part of the subsidy some sort of merchandise acceptable to the Arabs.General Jellicoe, Director of Military Labour in Egypt, does not think [Egypt No. 985 of the 20th September] that it is advisable to increase the already high pay of Egyptian labour, this course being likely to upset the economic situation of the country, without helping to bring in more men.With reference to the precarious state of Sultan Hosayifs health, Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 20th September [No. 982] suggesting that Prince Kemal-ed-Din should be recognised as heir apparent, and if found necessary as Regent. He was instructed [F.O. telegram No. 911 of the 21st September] that His Majesty&apos;s Government were averse from the policy of annexation in Egypt. They inclined to the candidature of Prince Fuad as successor to the throne, as there seemed no reason to suppose that the character and attitude of Prince Kemal-ed-Din had undergone any modification for the better, and desired further information as to the latter&apos;s present sentiments before coming to a definite decision.Meanwhile the state of the Sultan [Egypt, No. 995] appears to be growing rapidly worse.The condition of the Sultan [No. 1001 of the 23rd September] is now very nearly hopeless, although, if no sudden collapse intervenes, His Highness may linger on for a time.[898-62] B 2
Prince Kemal-ed-Din [Egypt No. 1004 of the 24th September] having definitely maintained his attitude of unwillingness to accept the succession to the Sultanate, it has been decided to approach Prince Fuad on the death of the present Sultan.ARABIA.On the Russian European front Arabs are beginning to desert in hopes of being employed in Syria against the Turks.Arab officers prisoners of war in Russia are also asking for permission to serve in Arabia.STRIA.The view is still held by the Italian Government [Rome No. 793 of the 22nd Septem-ber] that no relief should be allowed to go to Syrian and Lebanon populations, there being no adequate guarantee that supplies may not reach the Turkish army.ADEN.Shaykh Muhammad Hassan, of Mirab[No. 455, Aden, the 20th September], a well-hnown Yemeni Imam, has written imploring our aid against the Turks. He says that if we made a diversion at Mocha he would produce 10,000 Arabs to join us. The Resident proposes helping him - at any rate, financially.Both the Resident [No. 456 of the;23rd September] and Sir R. Wingate [No. 993, Egypt, of the 21st September] are strongly of opinion that immediate financial assistance should be accorded to the Idrisi.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.GERMAN PRESS.Sir Mark Sykes, as seen by the Author of an Article on Mesopotamia in the &quot; Zeitschrift der Gesellschafi fur Erdkunde zu Berlin.&quot;&quot; There is much ground for believing that the English have very full descriptions of the country which they keep secret. They were certainly better informed in many respects regarding the country than the Turks or ourselves. In the enemy&apos;s books, for instance, of F. R. Maunsell, G. L. Bell, and Mark Sykes we can detect, reading between the lines, a mass of hidden, keen, and purposeful work for British Imperialism.....&quot; From the geographical point of view the most valuable material for the Kurdish question is to be found in the second part of Mark Sykes&apos; &apos; The Caliphs last Heritage,&apos; which gives an account of the numerous journeys of that gifted soldier and political   * agent.&quot; . . . . His keen arguments regarding the modern Armenians are also very well woi*th studying.&quot;&quot; ROUMANIA.Sir G. Barclay telegraphed [No. 328 of the 24th September] to the effect that the Avar having practically exhausted the financial resources of Roumania, Allied help was indispensable, and gave details of the measures immediately necessary in this connection.RUSSIA.The Minister of Foreign Affairs stated to Sir G. Buchanan [No. 1505 of the 24th September] that M. Kerensky would return from headquarters on the 25th, and that after he had been consulted the composition of the new Government would be made public. The Democratic Congress was also to meet that day, and the Minister, though confident that the Congress would support the Government, hinted that M. Kerensky would not consider its hostility sufficient reason for his resignation. There are indications of a growing realisation in the Petrograd Soviet of the necessity of strengthening the army, Russian socialist delegates having made no secret of their opinion that the failure of Russian arms contributed largely to their want of success in Allied countries.
Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed [No. 1507 of the 25th September] that the meeting of the Democratic Congress &quot;would not meet until the 27th September, when M. Kerensky, instead of announcing his new Government to Congress, would submit a list for ratification. His own position, owing to the Korniloff incident, was not quite secure. General Verthovsky might conceivably succeed him.EGYPT.The Italian Government [F.O. No. 925 of the 26th September) have approached His Majesty&apos;s Government with demands which cannot fail to raise the general question of Arabia and Anglo-Italian relations there. Amongst these is a desire for the partici-pation for the Red Sea patrol of Italian vessels and a request for the relaxation of the patrolian blockade in Asir, as also for permission for Italian dhows to trade between various places on the Arabian Coast and Erithrea,ARABIA.Bin Saud [Cox&apos;s No. 3891 of the 21st September) is apparently consolidating his position to the north of Nejd.PBWnSD AT THB FOREIGN OFFICE BY O.

ARABIA Hejaz.Intelligence.Sherif Abdullah claims to have destroyed five kilometres of railway and eight bridges on August 18, and it is reported that 326 rails, thirty telegraph poles and six small bridges were destroyed between Muderrij and kilometre 1103, on August 23, two Arabs being killed and two Turks wounded. A thousand rails have also been blown up by the French detachment in Sherif Abdullah&apos;s sphere.Harb tribesmen state that many houses in Medina, have been pulled down for firewood for the engines. A report from Sherif Ali speaks of the sacking of much property,, and says that the Turks are&apos;looting Medina owing to hunger. It is reported that Fakbri Pasha has been ordered to send all his Camel Corps to Jerusalem, and that he replied that this would mean surrender.On August 28 the Flying Corps dropped over 100 bombs on the railway and buildings at Maan, and eight direct hits were obtained on the engine sheds. A field battery and other-troops in the neighbourhood were successfully bombed on the 29th.Sherif Zeid states that one to three Turkish (as well as Arab) deserters arrive daily at his camp near Medina, and that others arrive at the cam]) of Sherif Ali. These deserters are in a weak condition, and report that the Medina garrison is disheartened on account of the destruction of the railway, and the stoppage of trains. It is stated by the King that Sherif Zeid has occupied positions which isolate Bir el-Mashi.There is no further news from Akaba, where there are at present about 2,000 trained Arab troops. The Turks have still a post at Fuweilah.Raids on the Railway.Bimbashi Garland reports as follows on recent railway raid-ing operations made by Sherif Abdullah&apos;s forces at Abu Markha camp. He left the camp on August 7 with the intention of breaking a long section of line between Istabl Antar and Bueir, and arrived at the foot of Jebel Antar on August 9, in the morning.The party consisted of thirty-six natives trained in demolition -work, including nine Ageyl, seven Yambo townsmen, and twenty men from the Sheridan trained army (chiefly Mesopotamians). The-escort detailed by Sherif Abdullah was 100 strong, but at no time during the operations did it exceed 200, and was under a Sherif Nasir.After feeding and watering at a spring called Helwan, near Jebel Antar, about an hour from Istabl Antar station, the party proceeded at dusk towards the railway, and after negotiating a most tortuous path over the Jebel south of Jebel Antar, met the
 our scouts who had been sent Forward to reconnoitre. They reported that the.Turks were patrolling the line and had fired on them. Sherif Nasir said that apparently they had had notice of our intentions from, the Beduin living at Helwan and that it was useless to proceed that night.   The party returned to Helwan.The next morning it became clear to Bimbashi Garland how the Turks had become aware of the presence of the Arab party. He was astonished to find that Abu Nairn station, as well as that of Istabl Antar, could easily be seen, when pointed out, from the position on which the party was camped, and that the previous day in approaching Helwan the party had marched some ten kilometres along the Wadi containing the railway in easy view of any observant Turk at either of these two stations. The proximity of the latter had not been pointed out to him, and he had supposed that the line ran along the other side of the range of hills, which is really east of it.However, the next night, patrols reported that the Turks were not patrolling, but were occupying a hill some three kilometres south of Istabl Antar station, and it was decided to make a small break between these two points and leave the district.About 7 p.in. the party left Helwan, and passing Istabl Antar station on the left at about 1,000 yards, at which point the camels were left behind, proceeded on foot for about a mile, when the line was reached. About 100 rails were destroyed, but the Turks appeared as lighting up was being finished and the demolition party had to withdraw under fire, reaching Helwan as dawn was breaking.That evening, August 11, the party proceeded to a point between Abu Nairn and Jedhah stations to destroy 1,000 rails. Much delay was caused here through the position selected by Sherif Nasir for leaving the camels being about one and a. quarter hours&apos; inarch from the line, and so it was after 2 a.m. when the party actually got to work. Some 850 rails were destroyed, but Bimbashi Garland had much trouble in getting the Ageyl and Yambo men to do the work correctly, some of them refusing to remove superfluous charges from the rails where five or six had been put on one rail. He found it practically impossible to thoroughly supervise alone a purely Arab party doing a break of 1,000 rails, ancl his comments on the matter are given below.The explosions occupied about an hour and a good break was effected, the party getting away just at daybreak. During the firing of the charges, Jedhah station turned a poor search-light on the party but no Turks were encountered.A return was made to Ain Turaa, where a fresh supply of explosive, sent by Sherif Abdullah according to arrangement, was found.The party left this place again on the afternoon of August 14, and reached the proposed point of attack  (between Jedhah
and Hadiyah stations) at about 12.30 a.m. Beduin scouts reported all clear and the escort was supposed to occupy points on the left and right of the section of line to be destroyed. .The- dynamiters marched towards the line, each carrying about thirty pounds of guncotton and unarmed, over two rows of hills covered with heavy drift sand. They were proceeding roughly in line, and Bimbashi Garland reports that as he and two of the Mesopotamians were approaching a railway bridge of four spans, about thirty Turks opened rapid fire on them at about fifty yards range. The flat treeless wadi provided no cover, and a hurried retreat was made, whilst the Turks kept up a furious fire, to which the Beduin made a desultory reply from hills that were at least 1,000 yards away from the line, points that were obviously useless for covering the railway at night time.After about a quarter of an hour, the Turks hurried away to the north, and the dynamiting party returned to the line and destroyed some 800 rails, but it was impossible to inspect the damage done, as morning was approaching and the Beduin escort had proved of a rather migratory nature. There were no Arab casualities, but this was chiefly because the Turks made the mistake of firing a few moments too soon.The party returned to Abu Markha on August 16.A second party, including French Mohammedan troops for the dynamiting, left Abu Markha three days later with sufficient explosive to destroy 1,000 rails, whilst a, third party of Egyptian Army soldiers, under El Miralai Davenport Bey (recently arrived at-Abu Markha) was due to leave with the intention of breaking about 1,600 rails about a week later.Bimbashi Garlancbs remarks on Arab demolition parties are as follows : &quot; These purely Arab demolition parties on a large scale are very difficult to control ; in fact, it is a mistake to suppose that the British officer does in any way control them. They carry out only7 such parts of onc&apos;s schemes and instructions as suit them, and often flatly refuse to make alterations when mistakes are pointed out to them. I am advising Sherif Abdullah to dispense with Ageyl and other natives for demolition work, as they are too unreliable, and are vei*y expensive, each man&apos;s monthly pay being L.E. 15. The Mesopotamian and Syrian soldiers are very much better, and under well-trained officers (which he has), will do the work well. It is extremely difficult for the British officer when, for instance, he finds men tying two and more charges to one rail and the Arabs refuse to move the surplus ones, to have to do so himself. In fact, there is not time for it, as extensive demolitions occupy some three hours, and this even does not give sufficient time to thoroughly inspect the whole length of line prior and subsequent to firing the charges.
&quot;Also, as the Turks are taking more effective steps for guarding the line, it is necessary that some means be provided of ensuring that the Beduin escort occupies positions on the flanks that are really effective ones. This means that the command of expeditions must not be left to Sheikhs and Sherifs. but must be given to the Sherifs trained officers.&quot;Ibn SaiuVs relations with Ibn Rashid.In view of the suspicions which were at one time cast on the attitude of Ibn saud by Sherif Abdullah (p. 314), the following letters are of interest as showing his loyalty to the Arab cause : Letter from Ibn Rashid to Ibn Saud, dated May 7.&quot; Praises be to God, our affairs are all right. May God save you. You,know what happened between you and myself in the past and the cause was the devil saud ibn Salih al Subhah. By the grace of God now that cause has been removed. Nothing is more dear to me than to do good to (lie Mohammedans, and according to what I know you too desire it. I have therefore written to you this note.&quot; My belief in God and then in you is good. You need not be anxious about me, because we, God willing, are on what pleases you, on what existed between us in the past.&quot; I beg that in case you accept it you should send a trust-worthy deputj7, so that we make an arrangement and a duplicate copy will be sent to you.   Salams.&quot;Letter from Ibn Saud to Ibn Rashid dated May 15.&quot; Praises be to God, our affairs are all good. I received your esteemed letter and duly understood its contents, especially what you mentioned about peace. Yon say that you want peace. You know, 0 brother, that the dearest thing to us&apos; is to effect peace between Mussalmans, and to unite the Arabs. If this was a matter between us and you, there could be no hitch. Your excuse is accepted and thank God nothing happened but good. About the future, we place in you good belief. But, 0 Brother, the matter nowadays does not rest in my hands. If you Avant good to happen, and you want your interests and those of the Arabs, peace can be concluded only under three conditions.&quot; Firstly, you should sever your relations with that wretched Government which gives loss to our religion as well as our world. I mean the Turkish Government, who did not leave anything undone, and the last thing they have done is the disgrace they meted out to Muslim women, about which you must have heard.&quot; Secondly,   you   should befriend   yourself    with    theGovernment whose allies   we, your brother Arabs, are, and  weare bound to unite all Arabs. Your interests are under their hands.
outside the towns. The latter have command of a greater fighting strength than can be produced by the town leaders, and long established animosities made them ever ready to play into the hands of the Turks against the towns. The most important tribe between. Najaf and Karbala. on the right bank of the Hindiyah branch, and parti)&apos; on the left bank also, is the Bani Hasan, and the two principal Sheikhs, &apos;Amran and &apos;Alwan, sons of Haji Sa&apos;dun, have long be m a source of anxiety to both the Holy Places. On the left bank of the Hindiyah, the Fatlah, and their neighbours the Yassar on the Hillah branch above Hillah, had old scores against the towns and the opportunity to pay them off was not wanting.In April, 1916, occurred the famous disturbances in Karbala, which ended once more in the discomfiture of the Turks. Both Najaf and Karbala threw off the semblance of Ottoman, rule esta.bli.shed during the months which had elapsed since the rising of 1915, and the town Sheikhs resumed their authority. On tins occasion the Bani Hasan, had given some assistance to the Turks, and the towns knowing the temper of the tribes had little con-fidence as to the future. The jurisdiction of the town Sheikhs was confined to narrow municipal limits, beyond; which there was no semblance of order. The tribes, all of which are loose confederations made up of more or less independent constituents, did as they pleased and defied the ruling of paramount Sheikhs whom the Turks were impotent to back; river and, high road were open to their depreciations.Such was the position, whan the Turks withdrew in March 1917. AVithin the municipal limits of Najaf and Karbala the toAvn Sheikhs had the ordering of civil government, but their authority rested on a very uncertain basis and was constantly menaced by the tribes. Up to the fall of Baghdad the Turks had held Musaiyib, where the Baghdad-Karbala road crosses the Euphrates, above the bifurcation of the Hindiyah and Hillah branches of the river ; when they left, a provisional government was set up locally. Outside the towns anarchy prevailed and no road was safe.Apart from the pressing appeals of the towns that we should take over civil government and pla,ce it in the hands of British officers, there was a further consideration of great importance to the Army of Occupation. The Euphrates basin from Musaiyib to Samawah is one of the chief food-producing areas of the Iraq. Baghdad normally depends for its food upon this region and upon the Ba&apos;qubah-Khanaqin district, and since only a, small part of the latter is in our possession, the Euphrates corn-lands acquire a, yet higher significance. At the time of occupation, the winter-sown crop of wheat and barley was almost ripe ; the Government clues, especially if they could be collected in kind, were obviously a most valuable asset, and it was essential to establish some control over the district, so as to prevent the harvest from leaking into the desert, cither to the Turks or to Syria.   It must
be borne in mind thai&apos;, the fact that the Turks have lost this rich food-producing area is to them one of the most disastrous con-sequences of the fall of Baghdad. &apos;Early in April permission was obtained for two Political Officers to proceed to Karbala ancl Najaf, returning via Hindiyah, to report on the state of the country ancl the prospects of the grain market. Towards the end of the same month, primarily in the interests of the supply question, a Political Officer was appointed, with headquarters at Musaiyib, to organise Arab levies (Shabanah) for patrolling, to begin with, the main routes of supply into Baghdad, viz. those from Hillah, Musaiyib and Karbala, with which places, pending the appointment of Govern -mcnt agents, relations had been conducted directly by the Chief Political Officer,from Baghdad. For the time being the functions of the local officer did not extend down the Euphrates Valley further south than Hillah.To establish security on road and river was the first task. The most powerful tribe on the southern half of the Baghdad-Musaiyib road and along the Musaiyib-H.il lah road is the Zubaid, who hold the country between the Euphrates and the Tigris. The head Sheikhs of two large sections were accordingly encouraged to co-operate with us in the protection of these roads by providing their quota for the Shabanah, ancl, pending the expansion of the scheme, the protection of the main routes south of the three towns above mentioned was entrusted to local tribal headmen. The presence at Musaiyib of a British column, which had been sent out to avenge the murder of a British officer between Musaiyib ancl Fallujah in May, greatly facilitated the inception of the Shabanah scheme. At first there was a general disinclination on the part of the Sheikhs concerned to agree to their men being employed outside their own tribal limits, but this attitude is not an unnatural one, and it is expected that as time goes on, and their relations with us become more intimate, it will disappear.ABYSSINIA.The French authorities at Jibuti have seized some letters sent to Ali Said Pasha by the two Germans from Aclis Abeba who were recently reported in French Somaliland (see p. 317). One of these letters, giving a message which the Pasha was to telegraph to Berlin, shows that the Germans believe that Li j Yasu has no chance of returning to power, but that the probability of Ras Taffari being able to establish a strong-govern ment is almost equally remote. A letter from Ganiazmach Bajena, ex-Minister for Foreign Affairs, to Vienna, announcing the accession of the Empress was also captured.&apos;
The German Missi.o.n&apos;s departure having been facilitated by the Abyssinian authorities, the Allied legations at Adis Abeba have addressed a protest to the Government, insisting on the arrest and disarming of the Mission should it return to Abyssinia, and pointing out that, should any further facilities be given to the Germans to create trouble, the three Powers would be obliged to consider it as a breach of neutrality.Adis Abeba reported under date August 1. that the news from Wbllo was somewhat unsatisfactory. Lij Yasu had gone northward with the part of his force which broke out from Magdala, and had occupied Talanta, the capital of Edju. Dejaz Ainadie, not having sufficient troops to hold it, had fallen back and joined his father Ras Wolye, and their combined army was reported to have occupied a strong defensive position, leaving Talanta in the hands of the rebels. Lij Yasu reopened the telegraph line and sent a message to the Italian legation that he was certain of victory.On August 8, our Minister wrote that Lij Yasu had marched south from Edju and joined up with Ras liner for a movement against Dessie. Their forces reached that place in advance of the Government troops and appear to have scored a success, taking some 300 prisoners, including the local Commandant. Only the rumour of approaching reinforcements kept them from occupying the town, which was apparently defenceless. On the following day the Government army under Fitaurari Hapta Giorgis arrived, and a skirmish at long range took place without much loss on either side. The rebel troops took up a position on the neighbouring hills, while the Fitaurari occupied the town.Lij Yasu&apos;s army numbers only 4,000 to 5,000, but he can count on the support of the local Moslem tribes, who are to a certain extent provided with rifles. Iiapta Giorgis has about 30,000 troops in the field, but they are thoroughly tired of the war, and owing to the rains he cannot be reinforced before October.The attitude of Tig-re, moreover, is causing considerable anxiety, and although the Government have for the third time forced Ras Seyyun to take the most solemn oath of fidelity to the Empress, they still hesitate to allow him to return to his own country lest he should throw in his lot with Lij Yasu.The disinclination of the Fitaurari&apos;s troops to continue fight-: iug maj7 possibly compel the Government to withdraw from Wollo, of which Lij Yasu might then remain an independent ruler. Abyssinia in the past has always tended to split up into independent kingdoms when the central power was weak, and it seems not unlikely that the same process is again taking place. The provincial, chiefs show an inclination to stand, aside from what they regard as a personal contest between Ras Taffari and Lij Yrasu, and respect for the central Government is rapidly
disappearing. The Empress and Ras Taffari may retain, their titles and nominal supremacy, but they will probably lose all real control over the great provincial rulers.Since the above was written, a telegram from Adis Abeba gives the satisfactory news that Lij Yasu&apos;s army was completely defeated on August 27 by Hapta Giorgis, and that Ras Iraer has been killed.   The fate of Lij Yasu himself is still unknown.He has shown a remarkable faculty in the past for deserting his followers on the field of battle without losing his prestige among the Mohammedan tribes, and it is much to be hoped that he has not again made good ins escape.NOTES.Sheikh Salim of Koweit.Our Political Agent at Koweit writes under date June 18 :  Sheikh Saliin has many detractors and some of his employees are far from loyal. His inscrutability and a rather forbidding demeanour are qualities rather discouraging to tattlers and intriguers. But in all that concerns the business of the British Governments interests, I hav-e found, him hitherto pleasantly amenable. The missionaries do not love him. He has not called on them since his accession, which is regrettable, but, on the other hand, when written to by them about a certain bit of land which the former wished to add to their property, he replied in a frank and friendly manner agreeing to let them have it and promising to come and inspect the site.The Indians at Hodeidah.The Turkish authorities in the Yemen were recently approached with a view to the release of the British Indian prisoners at Hodeidah. General Ahmet Tewfik, the G.O.C., and Mahmud Xadim Pasha, the Vali, replied that on the outbreak of war they received orders to detain all enemy subjects, but that these subjects enjojr complete freedom, and are kept in comfort. They state that they can only release the Indians if we produce official instructions to that effect from the G.G.C. at Constantinople, and the)&apos; express a hope that this will be clone.Meanwhile, the prisoners have been moved fifteen miles inland.
