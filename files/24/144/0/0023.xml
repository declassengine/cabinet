SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT, No. XLVIII.Russia.Very interesting comment on the Russian situation is contained in a telegram from the &quot;Times&quot; correspondent at Washington, dated the 27th December (&quot;Times,&quot; 28th December). This telegram speaks of the anxiety felt in America &quot; because, of the accumulation of evidence that the Bolshevist leaders are planning a world-wide social revolution, and that they are as anxious as the Kaiser himself to destroy democratic institutions.&quot; He adds : &quot; The United States Government is now in possession of evidence of a conspiracy of the Bolshevists to come to America in order to spread the&quot; doctrine of communal organisation by direct action.&quot;This statement is most significant. It shows that the American Government are alive to the apparently unnatural alliance of Kaiserism and Karl Marxism aiming at the overthrow of the existing order of Christian society by the domination of majorities by militant minorities acting by force, terrorism, and conspiracy.Zionism.The relations between the Arab and Jewish branches of the Semitic race are not altogether satisfactory, owing apparently to the exaggerated versions of Zionist demonstrations in the West and the absence of a similar overt championship of Arab national aspirations. It is due also to the lack of personal contact between the responsible leaders of Zionism in America and Englana and the corresponding Arab eaders in Palestine and Egypt. Neither of these causes are irremediable and the lifficulties of accommodation can be overcome. However, the declaration of war aims by the British Labour party is unhappy in that it formulates the creation of a &quot; free state&quot; for the Jews in Palestine, while Arabia and Mesopotamia are to be &quot; adminis-tered &quot; by a commission of the League of Nations. This inequality is likely to create difficulties. The Labour party are more Zionist than the Zionists themselves, and yet o not give due credit to the aspirations and achievements of the Arabs.The great Zionist demonstration in New York is made increasingly significant by he reported despatch of trustworthy Zionists to Petrograd to bring about the downfall ?f Eolsheviki Jews.Turkey.Attention is drawn to the interesting report regarding the attitude of the Turks to ilie military situation before Salonica. What the Turk realises is that any transfer )f troops from the Salonica theatre to Palestine would be a disaster for Turkey.W. 0.-G.December 28, 1917.

Howard telegraphed on the 20th December [No. 3511] that a leading Bolshevik who had just returned from Petro-grad had had a conversation with Mr. Sharp. He had said in the course of it that as at Brestlitovsk the Bolshevik delegates would be surrounded by German influences, the Government had quite determined that the peace negotiations should not be held at that place but in some neutral capital, Stockholm or Copenhagen, in order that public opinion against excessive German demands might be formed by means of the neutral press ; the armistice negotiations had shown that this was the only way of opposing German demands.Peace Proposals- Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 23rd December [No. 2106] that the following were the six main points of the Russian peace proposals : 1. No territory conquered during the war is to be retained by force. All such territory must be evacuated as soon as possible.2. Complete independence to be restored to all peoples who have lost it during war.3. Peoples not independent are to have the right to decide their future by means of the referendum. This right is to be granted to all small weak peoples, apart from the questions of the date of annexation, of the degree of civilisation of the nation annexed, or of the position of the territory in or out Europe.4.&apos; In territories occupied by more than one nationality the minority shall be guaranteed independent national culture, and, where possible, independent administratively ion.5. No military contributions are to be paid. Such contributions already enacted to be returned, and damage to private property to be made good from a special fund contributed by all combatants in proportion.6. Colonial questions to be decided on the principles laid down in 1 and 4.[898-75] B
The Question of Messengers [Eastern Report, XLVII, p. 2]. On the 20th December Sir G. Buchanan repeated [No. 2081] a previous telegram communicating a translation of a note issued by M. Trotsky &quot;for the information of allied and neutral embassies and missions,&quot; which ran as follows : &quot; Certain embassies have refused to viser the passports of diplomatic couriers of the People&apos;s Commissary of Foreign Affairs. These embassies give as a reason that the Council of People&apos;s Commissaries is not yet &apos; recognised&apos; as a Govern-ment. The question of recognition is one of &apos; form,&apos; and the Soviet treat with complete indifference these details of diplomatic (? caprice). Non-recognition does not, however, dispense with the necessity for reckoning on the Government of the Soviet as (? a) fact. The pretension that a &quot;non-recognised&quot; Government cannot have diplomatic couriers is without foundation, as the Soviet considers diplomatic relations to be necessary not only with the Government, but also with the socialist revolutionary parties who are striving to overthrow existing Governments. Finally, it is impossible not to remark that the embassies iu question are not consistent in their policy of &apos; non-recognition,&apos; since they continually apply to the Commissary for Foreign Affairs in order to get authorisations, certificates, and guarantees for the free passage of their diplomatic couriers, &amp;c. Considering the continuation of such practices to be entirely inadmissible, the Commissary for Foreign Affairs has decided henceforth to give no laisser-passer, and in general to grant no facilities to the embassies which imagine that their sole function is to place petty (? bureau-era tic) difficulties in the way of the Government of the Soviet.&quot;Telegraphing again on the same day [No. 2085] Sir G. Buchanan said that M. Trotsky had told the French Ambassador that he only claimed for his couriers the same right that they all possessed in Petrograd of associating with members of all parties ; his note he said had been written in a moment of irritation at the refusal of the visa by the Swedish Government.On the 22nd December he telegraphed [No. 2097j that Captain Smith [Eastern Report XLVII, p. 4] had seen M. Trotsky who had agreed that the mission of his couriers should be restricted to their duties as such. Tie expected that Sir G. Buchanan would grant a visa for a messenger to leave at once, but he was told that the whole arrangement must be referred to London as he had given no information as to whom the bags would be delivered. U. Trotsky lost his temper.and gave orders that the messengers whom he had promised to let in should be stopped ; he also said that he would stop all of our messengers till his were allowed to pass freely.Telegraphing again [Nos. 2095, 2096] on the same day he said that a number of documents had been published in that morning&apos;s papers to shown that the Americans were helping General Kaleclin. M. Trotsky told Captain Smith that he was determined to discover what the allies were really doing. Pie said, too, that several arrests had already been made, but he did not say whether the persons arrested were B,ussian or allied subjects.M. Trotsky had asked him, through Captain Smith, a number of questions respecting the presence of British officers either in the Ukraine or wdth General Kaledin and had requested him to make an explanatory statement in the press. He had accordingly published one the text of which was as follows :  &apos;&quot; The press has lately published comments on the alleged activities of British officers in the Ukraine and in Novotcherkass. There are only two British officers at Kieff under the control of the embassy. They are members of General Poole&apos;s military equipment section, and Avere sent out from England at the request of the Russian Government as instructors of gunnery and motor transport. They do not speak Russian, and have been given strict instructions not to interfere with politics. So far as the British embassy knows there are no British officers at Novotcberkass. If any British railway experts have passed through districts under the control of General Kaledin, it was solely for the purpose of ensuring the despatch of food supplies to the Roumanian army and the civil population.&quot; The ambassador has no intention of interfering in questions of Russian internal politics, and both he and all those placed under him will continue to maintain an attitude of strict neutrality in all conflicts that may arise either between political parties or Russian component nationalities. Unfortunately Russia at present is divided into a number of almost independent republics, each having its own de facto Government, and in this abnormal situation the very difficult position in which British officials sometimes find themselves placed must be taken into account.&quot;
sOn the 23rd December he telegraphed again [No. 2110] saying that M. Trotsky had apparently not carried out his threat to stop our messengers, as one had arrived that afternoon, though there had been ample time to stop him. On the 24th December (before the receipt of this telegram) Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 2516] giving Sir G. Buchanan permission to viser the passport of M. Trotsky&apos;s messenger,British Residents. In the course of the conversation (reported above) between Captain Smith and M. Trotsky regarding the messenger question, the latter said that he would stop all British subjects leaving Bussia unless he heard officially, within the next two or three days, of the release of the interned russians, Chicirin ancl fmpliroff [Eastern Beport XL-TV&quot;, p. 5] At the same time he declared that he would have the British and French control officers at Tornea arrested and conducted across the frontier: he had, he said, already complained of their attitude towards his commissaries. Sir G. Buchanan expressed the opinion that these measures, as well as his action in regard to the messengers, had been provoked by the fact that M. Trotsky was convinced that the allies were working against the Bolsheviks by supporting the Ukraine and General Kaledin.On the 24th December Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 2526] that Sir G. Buchanan might officially notify M. Trotsky that the two russians interned in England would be sent to Bergen.The Black Sea Fleet. The British consul at Odessa telegraphed on the 20th December [No. 168] that a resolution had been passed on the previous day by the central committee of the Black Sea fleet, by a majority of more than five to one, demanding the immediate convention of the Constituent Assembly, the release of all arrested members, the cessation of the Bolshevik attack on the Ukraine and of civil war. The week before, this fleet helped the Bolsheviks against the Cossacks, and threatened to bombard Odessa in support of the former.Germany and the Restoration of Monarchy. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 19th December [No. 2069] that there appeared to be a German organisation whose object was said to be the placing of the Tsarevitch on the throne; its headquarters were at Helsingfors. The growing influence of the anarchists and the struggle over the constitution were rapidly preparing the ground for that complete state of anarchy which would be the precursor of monarchy. The Germans alone were capable of restoring order, and as the security of life and property was all that the majority of the people cared for at present, even a monarchy supported by German bayonets would be a welcome boon. Christmas Day (new style) had been mentioned as the date of the carrying into execution of the plan to place the Tsarevitch on the throne. Sir G. Buchanan thought it probable that this date was premature, but that something of the kind would be attempted before long.The Ukraine.The Bolsheviks and the Rada. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 20th December [No. 2086] that the Rada demanded that there should be no interference with the affairs of the&apos; Ukraine, or in the direction of the armies on the south-west ancl Roumanian fronts, that all Ukraine troops on other fronts should be despatched to the Ukraine, and that delegates therefrom should be admitted to the peace conference. Negotiations were in progress, and the Bolsheviks would probably agree to these terms as the Ukraine was stopping the supply of grain, and the Bolsheviks had no troops keen on fighting.Bessarabia.The Neio Bessarabia Government. The Consul at Odessa forwarded [No. 169] on the 22nd&apos;.December a message from Captain Pitts, who had met the leading members of the new Bessarabia Parliament and Government at Kishinieff, all young and inexperienced-ineperienced men. The Maximalists and the Socialists were exciting the peasants, and the Government, in agreement-with General Tcherbatcheff, was raising a few regiments to maintain order, and the commandant of the militia informed Captain Pitts that, later they would require one or two military instructors, and hinted that they would prefer British from Petrograd to French from Jassy, as the latter were suspected of pro. Roumanian tendencies.   The programme of the new Government was distribution of[898-75] B 2
land without compensation (this is to appease the peasants, the leaders hope eventually to have expropriation with compensation) ; pacification in agreement with the Ukraine and the Allies ; federation with Russia.Finland.The Bolsheviks and Independence. In his telegram of the 20th December, already referred to, Sir E. Howard said that Mr. Sharpe had been told that the Bolshevik Government would agree to the autonomy of Finland, but not to its independence, nor would it withdraw its troops.ZIONISM.The Arabs and Zionism. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 20 th December TNo. 1374] that no indication had so far been received of the attitude of King Hussein, but he was likely to prove more difficult than the Cairo Arabs, who were more sophisticated. As to the latter, he had spoken with various members of the Arab committee and also with Mosseri, a Jewish leader. He had brought these into touch and had urged a combination. The Arabs, though they seemed to be impressed by the arguments advanced, were still nervous, and felt that their interests were threatened. Provided that the Jews act up to the liberal principles laid down by the Jewish leaders in London, intercourse with them and discussion would doubtless tend to allay the fears of the Arabs ; but the Jews must be careful not to frighten them by going too fast. Sir R. Wingate hoped to be able to arrange for a Moslem Arab to proceed to London to serve on Sir Mark Sykes&apos;s committee.ABYSSINIA.The Demand of lias for Arms. [Eastern Report XLVII, p. 2]. Mr. Campbell telegraphed from Adis Abeba on the 17th December [No. 74] that on account of the present improvement in the position of Ras as compared with that when he asked for arms, the French Minister was no longer convinced of the need of granting his request.PERSIA.Vossuk-ed-Dowleh--[Eastern  Report  XLVII, p.  3]. . Mr.- Balfour telegraphed[No. 356] to Sir C. Marling on the 20th December in reply to his telegram of the 16th December [No. 446]. He said that though His Majesty&apos;s Government could not formally cancel the Anglo-Russian agreement without the concurrence of a properly constituted Government in Russia, it would agree to regard it as being in suspense. His Majesty&apos;s Government was prepared to give genuine aid and support to Persia if the Persian Cabinet showed a willingness to work in harmony with it; and if, at the close of the war, an international conference should be assembled in which non-belligerents generally took part the presence of Persian representatives would be welcome to His Majesty&apos;s Government. As to the South Persian Rifles, His Majesty&apos;s Government was prepared to look favourably on the constitution of a uniform force for the whole of Persia, after the wax, in which force the Rifles would be eventually incorporated ; but the retention of British officers for the duration of the war and for six months after its. termination would be insisted upon. The payments suggested by Sir C. Marling, if necessary, were approved, but credits for arms and for possible military operations were not regarded as necessary ; the maintenance of order was as desirable for British interests as for Persian and as it was realised that the Persian Government had no force adequate for the purpose, His Majesty&apos;s Government would continue to employ the South Persian Rifles so as to further the common desire in this respect; and it also proposed to place a detachment of armoured cars at the disposal of the Persian Government for the preservation of order in north-west Persia. After the war, the possibility of making over to that Government the arms and equipment of the South Persian Rifles would be favourably considered.Mr. Balfour added that he concurred in Sir C. Marling&apos;s view in regard to the Shah and the guarantees he asked for, and authorised him to act as he had proposed in his telegram of the 9th December.On the 21st December Sir C. Marling telegraphed [No. 464] saying that the Democrats were in close relations with the Maximalist soldiery, parties of whom had come to Teheran, and were promising to support the anti-British party.   There were
fears that they would take over the Russian Legation they had already practically expelled the consul from Kasvin. They were attempting to win over the rank and file of the Persian Cossacks. The support of the soldiers at Enzeli and Resht was being-enlisted by the Jangalis (who also had become anti-British), to whom they had sold a considerable quantity of rifles and ammunition and at least one machine gun. In these circumstances, he hardly thought that Vossuk-ed-Dowleh would take office on the conditions laid down in Mr. Balfour&apos;s telegram.Mr. Balfour replied to this on the 22nd December [No. 362] saying that he thought that Sir C. Marling should begin to negotiate with Vossuk-ed-Dowleh, in spite of the aggravated situation on the lines of his telegram of tha 20th December. He should then report developments.Sir C. Marling telegraphed again on the 22nd December [No. 467] saying that he had seen Vossuk-ed-Dowleh, whose attitude had been exactly what he had anticipated it would, be. He had insisted strongly on the need for money, and on something more positive in regard to the 1907 Convention, and the future of the South Persian Rifles. In regard to the money he would be quite satisfied by our giving an undertaking to do what cirumstances permitted, as he understood the financial difficulties.Telegraphing again on the same day [No. 469] he said that the Shah had declined for the moment to accept the resignation of Ain-ed-Dowleh, which had been tendered, as he (the Shah) was waiting the acceptance by us of his terms. These terms he has now outlined. He demands the securing to him of his personal estates, or instead, should we be unable to obtain possession for him, their capital value ; also a guaranteed pension of 100,000 tomans ; further, a lump sum of another 100,000 tomans plus 15,000 a month for so long as Vossuk-ed-Dowleh shall remain in office. Sir C. Marling had informed him that the last two points could not be entertained, and that altogether his demands were preposterous. He thought, however, that the first two should be accepted, with a proviso that later the capital value would be fixed. The assurance of these should be made after a firman giving him full powers had been received by Vossuk-ed-Dowleh. Beyond this, promises of substantial gratuities during his good behaviour would also have to be given to the Shah.Mr. Balfour replied [No. 368] to this last telegram on the 25th December-saying that he regretted that Vossuk-ed-Dowleh could not be induced to accept his terms which were really very great concessions. &apos; In regard to the Anglo-Russian agreement, it was impossible for us to denounce a treaty till there was a Russian Government with which we could negotiate, but no objection would be raised to the Persian Government withdrawing their recognition of it. In regard to the South Persian Rifles, the military authorities would not object to a Persian general, merely as a figure head ; but they insisted on the absolute necessity of the maintenance of the force with British officers till the end of the war.Foreign Troops in Persia. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 20th December [No. 457] that the Persian Government had sent him a note calling attention to the difficulties in its foreign relations arising from the presence of foreign troops in Persia and to the lamentable results to the country ; at the same time it informed him that Russian troops had plundered Khoi in North-West Persia. The note ended with a request that His Majestys Government would agree to withdraw its troops and to give an assurance iu writing to that effect. It was accompanied by the copy of a note, dated the 15th October, presented to the Persian Minister in Berlin by the German Minister for Foreign Affairs who promised that Germany would give every assistance to ensure the neutrality of Persia ; and, if Great Britain and Russia would withdraw the troops which threatened the Turkish frontier, would agree to the withdrawal of the troops of her allies and would apjoroach them on the subject.On the 25th December Mr. Balfour replied to this [No. 366] saying that the Persian Minister here had held similar language wdren making semi-official repre-sentations. He had been informed that we could never regard a German promise as an adequate guarantee, and that in any case there was nothing to be gained by representations in London; they would be made, if anywhere, at Petrograd. It was suggested to him that, as the press had recently stated that the Russian troops were to be withdrawn, the best course would be to await confirmation of this report.
GLATEST INTELLIGENCE.EUSSIA.The Vice-Consul at, Tornea. Sir Esme Howard telegraphed [No. 3541] on the 24th December that he had been informed by the vice-consul at Tornea that the commissary at that place had been instructed from Petrograd that the British and French officers were to be removed from passport control, and that no British or French couriers should be allowed to pass the frontier. In view of these instructions, the commissary was of opinion that the British vice-consid could only cross the frontier as a civilian, that lie could not be allowed to carry papers, and that he should be subject to search.ROUMANIA.Altitude in regard to Leace.  Sir G. Barclay said in a telegram [No. 801] sent on the 20th December that it must be borne in mind that the heart of the Roumanian people was never in this war. The Prime Ministers belief in our ultimate victory was the chief reason for the country joining us, and the disasters which have befallen it through the Russian collapse have left but very few in favour of anything but peace. Sir G. Barclay believed that, whatever might be the feeling of the army, the bulk of the people would welcome peace with enthusiasm; he did not doubt the good faith of the Prime Minister, but he felt that at any moment circumstances might become too strong for him.TURKEY.The Macedonian Offensive. Information has been received from a French source of a conversation with Moukhtar Bey, who, when asked whether Turkey was preparing an offensive in Macedonia, replied : &quot; Bulgaria has insisted on the offensive being taken in Macedonia against Sarraibs army. She was willing to answer for the operation, and I believe, in fact, that it would not have been impossible to throw Sarraibs army out of Salonika. Now it is precisely for that reason that Turkey opposes that offensive, which, if crowned with success, can only have disastrous effects for her. We are afraid lest Sarrail, defeated and forced to leave Salonika, should take all or part of his army to Palestine. This situation would be disastrous for us. At Salonika Sarraibs army is surrounded and immobilised and harms nobody. In Palestine it would be a very serious danger for Turkey. The Government of the Porte were in entire disagreement with Bulgaria on this point, and appealed to the German Government, who recognised the good grounds of the Turkish reasoning, and promised to undertake nothing against Sarraif&apos;s army.&quot;ARABIA.Asir.Idrisi. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 24th December [No. 1390] that the news of the British successes in Palestine was being spread through Asir, and the effect on Idrisi had been excellent. In regard to the coming operations Idrisi was full of confidence, and he expected to ca/pture Loheiya with but little difficulty.Yemen.General Conditions. In the same telegram [No. 139G] Sir R. Wingate said that news of Yemen had been received at Aden from a Jewish merchant. He had reported that the state of the British prisoners wTas satisfactory, but that the political situation was bad. The Imam, he said, was all-powerful there and in the vicinity ; he gave but little financial aid to the Turks, in regard to whom he preserved a friendly neutrality ; the Turkish Treasury was empty ; and the civilian inhabitants of the vilayet were at variance with the military.   The harvest had been exceptionally good.PEBSIA.Vossuk-ed-LJowleh. [See above, p. 4.] Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 24th December [No. 473] that vossnk-ed-Dowieh was convinced that by working with us he was perhaps risking his life, certainly his future, and he would probably prefer not to take a hand without an assurance of our intention to give him all possible support to ensure his success. Sir C. Marling had already done all that he could to beat down Vossuk-ed-Dowleh&apos;s terms.PKIXTED  AT THE FOKBIGN OFFICK BY C. E. HAKKISON.-28/12/1917.
