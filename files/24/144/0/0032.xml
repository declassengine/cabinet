APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACH ED EASTERN  REPORT. No   LVII.The news contained in this week&apos;s report may be said to be the climax of the crisis which was precipitated by the abdication of the Emperor of Russia. This climax has taken longer to reach than some might have anticipated, but it has now never -theless arrived.Russia.Russia is now being overrun by numerically small forces of the enemy. What he will do with tlie occupied territory is not very easy to see With a depleted and somewhat war-worn military machine Germany is absorbing lartre masses of non-German people, and doubtless many thousands of revolutionary agents. It has been decided by the Germans that this is the best alternative to allowing- Bolshevism to remain in a state of hostile pacificism along ihe old front. In neither case is the problem confronting the Germans easy or simple, however they continue to rely on the discipline of their army and the quiescence of their masses. It must be remembered, however, that revolutionary agents will follow the line of least resistance, and that they will proceed to foment discontent in the weaker and more susceptible quarters, viz., Poland, Galicia, &amp;c. In Russia itself the Red Guard will probably determine to fight Russian political opponents only.Poland.Trouble appears to be brewing.Roumania.Roumanias position is now practically impossible, and an early peace may be expected.Persia.The situation in Persia grows very menacing. Bolsheviks, Germau prisoners, Jangalis, Moslem fanatics, and Democrats combine on anti-Christian and anti-British lines. We are now confronting a coalition of forces which is out to produce a world revolution, a holy war, and a pan-Turanian rising. The advantage is one that our military defensive position in Mesopotamia is strong, that the enemy is not organised or capable of holding together for long or in large numbers. But Persian anarchy is a bud neighbour for Afghanistan and India.M. S.February 28, 191b.

The following are the peace terms imposed by Germany and accepted by the Bolshevik Government : 1. Germany and Russia to declare the state of war to end. Both nations believe that in the future they will live in peace and friendship.2. Regions which are to the west of a line as indicated at Brest-Litovsk to the Russian delegation, and which formerly belonged to the Russian State, are no more under the territorial protection of Russia. In the region of Dvinsk this line must be advanced to the eastern frontier of Courland. The former attachment of these regions to the Russian State must in no case involve for them an obligation towards Russia. Russia renounces every claim to intervene in the internal affairs of those regions. Germany and Austria-Hungary have the intention to define the further late of these regions in agreement with their populations. Germany is ready, after the completion of the Russian demobilisation, to evacuate regions which are to the east of the above-named line, so far as it is not stated otherwise in Clause 3.3. Livonia and Esthonia must be immediately cleared of Russian troops and Red Guards, and will be occupied by German police until the date when the constitution of the respective countries will guarantee their social security and political order. All inhabitants who were arrested for political reasons must be released immediately.4. Russia will conclude peace with the Ukrainian People&apos;s Republic. Ukraine and Finland will be immediately evacuated by Russian troops and Red Guards.5. Russia will do all in its power to secure for Turkey an orderly return of its Eastern Anatolian frontiers. Russia recognises the annulment of the Turkish capit-regulations.[898-84]B
6. Complete demobilisation of the Russian army, inclusive of detachments newly formed by the present Government, must be carried out immediately.7. Russian warships in the Black Sea, Baltic Sea, and Arctic Ocean must immediately either be sent to Bussian harbours, and kept there till the conclusion of a general peace, or be disarmed. Warships of the Entente which are in the sphere of the Russian authority must be regarded as Russian ships. Merchant navigation on the Black and Baltic Seas must be renewed as stater! in the armistice treaty. The clearing away of mines to begin immediately. The blockade of the Arctic Ocean to remain in force till the conclusion of a general p ace.8. The Russo-German commercial treaty of 1904 comes into force as stated in paragraph 11, clause 2, of the p^ace treaty with the Ukraine, with the exceptions as foreseen in paragraph 11, clause 3, of the commercial treaty concerning special privileges in the Asiatic countries-. Further, the whole of the first part of the final limits is re-established. This clause is to be completed by a guarantee of absolute frendom of export and free export of ores without any customs duties, the immediate opening of negotiations for the conclusion of a fresh commercial treaty, a guarantee of most favoured treatment at least until the end of 1925, even in the event of the expiry of the provisional arrangement, and finally the ratification of the corresponding paragraphs in the treaty with the Ukraine.9. The regulation of politico-juridical relations will be based on the first draft of &apos; the Russo-German juridical conve ition in so far as the corresponding decisions have not yet been taken. As regards indemnity for civil damages especially, the German proposal comes into force, while expenses for the maintenance of prisoners of war will be met according to the Russian proposal. Russia will give permits to and assist as much as possible German commissions for aiding prisoners of war, civilians, and refugees.10. Russia promises to put an end to every propaganda and agitati m either on the part of the Government or on the part of persons supported by the Government against the members of the Quadruple Alliance and their political and mditary institutions, even in localities occupied by the Central Powers.11. The above-named conditions must be accepted within forty-eight hours. Russian plenipotentiaries must siart immediately for Brest-Litovsk, and sign there within three days the peace treaty, which must be ratified within two weeks.Proclamations on Situation issued by the Council of People&apos;s Commissioners. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 21st, February jiNo. 540] that the following proclamation of the Council of People&apos;s Commissioners had been officially published that day : We, the Council of the People&apos;s Commissioners, made proposals for general peace negotiations to all the belligerent countries. The allied Governments rejected our proposals, and supported against us Dukhonin, Kaledin, Alexieff, the Kieff Rada, and the Roumanian Government, endeavouring to destroy our efforts for peace. The German and Austrian Governments entered into negotiations. But the peace offered proved to be based on annexations by violence. The proletariat of Germany and Austria, although aroused by the Bussian revolution, have not, however, yet found a way of combatting their imperialists.We, the Council of the People&apos;s Commissioners, consider that at the present moment revolutionary Bussia could not take upon her bruised shoulders the burden of a new war. We would not sign the annexations peace treaty, but declared that we were demobilising the army and that the war with Germany was at an end. This meant that the German people was no longer threatened by any danger from our side. The advance of Gtrmany under these condith ns could mean nothing but an open and perfectly clear act of brigandage. This, however, did not deter the German authorities. Without giving the seven days&apos; preliminary warning provided for by the conditions of the armistice, the Governments of the Hohenzollerns and Hapsburgs have advanced their troops in an attack on revolutionary Bussia. Individual remnants of our forces retired, almost without opposition, before the organised onslaugbts of the foe. Enemy troops having occupied Dvinsk, Venden, and Lutsk, are advancing and threaten to sever the more important lines of communication and destroy by starvation the main centres of the revolution.. Taking into consideration the spirit of our exhausted army, the state of the whole country, and in particular the condition of the transport of supplies, the Council of the People&apos;s Commissioners have made a fresh attempt [?to prevent the] advance of the Hohtnzollern soldiers, and have expressed their readiness to sign peace on the conditions presented to us.
Soldiers, workmen, peasants, we have taken this most painful step at the price of tremendous concessions to save the country from final exhaustion and the revolution from ruin. Bourgeois groups were awaiting the arrival of the German generals to settle their accounts with the revolution, and were raising a violent campaign of calumny against the Soviet authority.The press of the coalition parties was writing in the same strain aud alleging that we had voluntarily lowered our colours before the Hohenzollern. But you, comrades, workmen, soldiers, peasants, know the state of the country and the front as we do.Once the German working-class in this our menace had proved that it was still lacking in the decision and strength necessary to hold the criminal hand of its own militarism, we had no choice but to accept the conditions of German imperialism until, such time as the European revolution should have changed and abolished it.We do not yet know what reply the German Government will make. It is not hastening its reply, and apparently is endeavouring to take possession of the greatest possible additional number of the more important positions in our territory. We are profoundly convinced that the German proletariat will rise against the attempts of their ruling classes to suppress the revolution. But we cannot foresee with certainty when this will happen. We are awaiting the presentation of the German conditions, and are prepared to make the greatest possible sacrifices to ensure to our exhausted population the opportunity to cope with the appalling consequences of the war and to set forth onthe path of socialistic development.....   We desire peace, and are ready to accepteven an oppressive peace, but we must be prej-^ared to resist if the German counter-revolution endeavours to tighten the noose round our necks.The Council of the Peopled Commissioners summon all local Soviets and army organisations to exert every effort towards the reformation of the army. All demoralised elements, hooligans, marauders, and cowards must be mercilessly expelled its ranks and wiped off the face of the earth should they attempt to resist. All workmen and peasants not engaged in productive labour, all reflecting brave wrestlers in the cause of the revolution, must at once join the ranks of the Red Army. It is necessary to exert every effort towards the reorganisation and improvement of the transport of supplies. The bourgeoisie, who under Tsar Kerensky escaped the burdens of war, and profited by disasters, must be made to perform its duty by the most decisive and pitiless measures. The strictest discipline must be established in the ranks of the army and throughout the country; in Petrograd, as in all other centres of the revolution, order must be maintained and with iron hand. Workmen, peasants, soldiers, let our enemies within ami without know that for the cause of the revolution we are prepared, to hold out to the last drop of blood.Reuter says that the following further proclamation was issued on the 26th February : Workers, Peasants, Soldiers, and Sailors.-The Central Executive Committee of the Soviets has accepted the peace conditions imposed-sed by the Austro-Gei man Governments, and yesterday our answer was despatched by wireless. We are, however, still awaiting confirmation of receipt.The imperialist assassins are nevertheless continuing their monstrous advance into the interior of Russia. The damned minions of William and the German Kaledins, together with the White Guards, are advancing against and shooting the Soviets, reconstituting the power of the landlords, bankers, and capitalists, and preparing for the restoration of the monarchy. The revolution is in peril. A mortal blow will be struck against Red Petrograd.If you all, workers, soldiers, and peasants, wish to retain power  and the power of the Soviets you must fight these hordes who are now seeking to devour you to your last gasp.   The decisive hour has struck.   Workers and all oppressed men and women,, you must swell the ranks of the Red battalions.   To arms, all of you, that the struggle may only cease with your last breath !Martial Law in Petrograd. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 22nd February [No. 555] that the population of&quot; Petrograd had been mobilised, that a special staff for the district had been formed, and the town placed under martiai law.Socialization of T^and. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 20th February [No. 5281 that a fundamental law for the socialization of land had been published officially. It rescinded for ever ali private property whatsoever in land, subterranean wealth, waters, forests, and live natural forces in Russia.   Land, without any compensation whatsoever,
would be transferred to the control of local councils, for the use of the labouring-population actually working it. All private live and dead agricultural stock would be transferred without compensation from non-labouring hands to the local organization of councils. Personal labour was to be the fundamental basis of all enjoyment of agricultural land. The law stated that the trade in agricultural machines and seeds would be monopolised by the State, and that the grain trade, foreign and internal, would likewise be monopolised.EsTHONIA.Recognition of Constituent Assembly. On the 25th February Mr. Balfour tele-graphed to the British representatives in Paris, Rome, Tokio, and Washington, instructing them to inform the Governments to which they were accredited that the readiness of His Majesty&apos;s Government to recognise provisionally the Esthonian Constituent Assembly as a de facto independent body until the peace congress took place (when the future status of Esthonia ought to be settled on the principle of self-determination) had been communicated to Mr. Tonisson.Ukraine.Arrest of Roumanian Officers. Mr. Bagge telegraphed from Kieff on the 21st February [No. 49] that the Bolshevik Government had ordered the arrest of General Coanda aud the officers of the Roumanian mission, and that the order had been executed on the night of the 1.9th February. The allied representatives pointed out that General Muravieff had given six days -for the reply from Roumania, and that the term only expired on the 23rd. The Minister of War said that he knew nothing of the negotia-tions and would enquire.!.&apos; Departure of Allied Representatives from Kieff. Mr. Bagge telegraphed on the 21st February [No. 48] that he should acconqmny General Tabouis and the French mission, who hoped to leave on the following day. They could do nothing more, and General Muraftieff had gone.Roumania and the Allied Representatives at Odessa. -The consul-general at Odessa telegraphed on the 24th February [No. 33] saying that a note had been sent by Rumcherod to all the allied consuls requesting them &quot;to take steps to induce the Roumanian Govern-ment to withdraw its troops immediately from Russian territory; he said that without ^ny declaration of war or the breaking off of diplomatic relations Roumania had treacherously invaded Russia, and tried to capture Kisheneff. The consuls met and sent a joint note denying the allegations, and pointing out that only small bodies of Roumanian soldiers were in Bessarabia, and these had been sent for the purpose of guarding Roumanian provision depots.The Don Country.General Alexieff on the Situation. -On the 19th February Mr. Lindley telegraphed  No. 520] the following summary of&quot; a letter written, in French, on the 9th February by General Alexieff at Rostov to the French mission at Kieff, which had been translated and published by the Bolshevist Government : After saying that the Chief of the French military mission at Novo Cherkask had probably kept the French authorities at Kieff fully informed of the situation on the Don, General Alexieff declared that he had been induced to make that province bis base for operations, and the formation of a volunteer army by the large supplies of grain, the great natural resources, and the military strength of South-Eastern alliance of which the Don formed a part. He stated that he had imagined that a political organisation as powerful as the above-mentioned alliance would have had no difficulty in maintaining its independence against the Bolshevist (? disaffection), and that with the help of Cossack troops it would have been possible to create a reliable trained force capable of restoring order in Russia and reinforcing the Russian front. He added that although he knew the Cossacks would not advance beyond their own territory in support of any wide scheme for the restoration of order, he nevertheless had believed that they would at least defend their own property and lands which&apos;would have given him valuable time to carry out bis plans. However, owing to the complete demoralisation of the Cossack troops returning from the front and the fact that the great mass of them had become deeply infected with Bolshevism, the general stated that they had even refused to fight
5307to protect themselves, and that they were convinced that Bolshevism was only directed&apos; \ against the wealthy and propertied classes. For this reason he bad been compelled even in November last to use some of his new force, and in January he had been compelled to use his entire strength to (? group undecvpherable) (? train)ed men. The general complained that the whole burden of defending the Don province had rented with this numerically weak volunteer force as the Cossacks would not fight. He was therefore unable to carry out the organisation and training of tresh troops. He was also uuahle to obtain war material or supplies, as all his communications with Roumania and the South-Western front had been cut by the numerically strong Bolshevik column. He adds that such a step would greatly postpone the opening of decisive operations; added to which not only was the Kieff province unsuitable as a military base, but the Kieff Cossacks were also hopelessly demoralised.In view of his inequality in strength, General Alexieff stated that he should be compelled to evacuate the Don province unless help were sent. Evacuation would materially damage the general situation and diminish the chance of eventual success^ against Bolshevism. The general therefore begged the French mission to exert all its influence with General blocks to induce him to send, if not the whole, at least part of the Czech Slovak corps at present in the Kieff-Poltava district, whicn with the artillery concentrated in Ekaterinoslav Alexandrovsk (? Moscoi) stat Nikovo (sic) district would threaten the Bolshevik rear and free the Don from the danger of pressure from the West.POLAND.Suppression of the Organ of the Polish Government. Sir E. Howard telegraphed from Stockholm on the 23rd February [No. 517] that according to the &quot;Social Demokrat en,&quot; the Polish Government organ &quot; Bolskii Monitor&quot; had been suppressed by the Censor, and the Warsaw, paper &quot; Kinder Polskii&quot; had stated that on February 14th ali public offices, schools, university, factories, theatres, &amp;c. had been closed as a sign of national grief Only the Jewish newspapers had appeared. There had been general strikes in several Galician towns, including Cracow and Lemberg.ROUMANIA.Suing for Peace.  Sir W. Townley telegraphed from The Hague on the 20th February [No. -962] that it had been to-day announced in the press that Roumania had sued for peace. This was given as having come officiady from Vienna, and it whs further said that Count Czernin was leaving for Roumania. It was added that as it was believed that, if she could not secure her aims, Roumania was prepared to continue fighting. Austrian official circles were sceptical in regard to these negotiations. Sir W. Townley understood that Bessarabia was regarded as the difficulty, Ukrainia not being disposed to surrender it except in exchange for the Cholm district of Poland.Peace probahle. Lord Bertie transmitted [No. 275] on the 25th February an identic telegram from the allied ministers in Jassy, in the course of wThich they said that if the enemy conditions were not too humiliating, peace must be considered inevitable.PALESTINE.The Question of the French Protectorate of the Holy Places.-Genera,] Clayton telegraphed on the 25th February [No. 1 B. 688] that M. Picot had abstained from attendance at ceremonies in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the 16th and :.3rd February in consequence of a warning he had received from the guardian that the customary honours would not be paid to him as French representative, the French protection being no longer regarded as necessary, as the Turkish domination in Jerusalem had ceased. A communication on this point had been received from the general of the order of Friars Minor some weeks ago, and the new guardian, who had arrived on the 15th, had apparently produced a confirmation of the orders previously received.ASIATIC RUSSIA.Caucasia.Situation at Baku. Sir C. Marling reported on the 22nd February [No. 132] that the Imperial Bank of Persia in Teheran had received information fr m Resht that civil war was imminent at Baku ; the banks at that place had already been closed. [898-84] C
Turkestan.General Situation. On the 23rd February the Viceroy transmitted a telegram which had been received from Sir George Macartney on the 21st. The latter said that stock might now be taken of the present condition of Ferghana, as the excitement which had followed the giant by the Bulsheviks of autonomy had subsided. Thefts and robberies were frequent, but in spite of them the province was outwardly peaceful. Native Moslems had not acquired the administration, the local officials were all Russian, and the promised autonomy was still in the speculative stage. No native army was so far in existence, and Russian troops remained. War prisoners were to be seen in the streets mostly Austrians; but they were under control and obliged to attend roll-calls.   There was no evidence of Pan-Turanism in Ferghana.The happenings in Ferghana had left Kashgar unaffected ; and the Russian Khirgiz remained peaceful.Trans-Bakailia.General Situation. Sir J. Jordan telegraphed from Pekin [No. 168] on the 23rd February that the province was practically under the military control of the Cossacks, but at present any active resistance to the Bolsheviks could not be counted on; as the influence of the Bolshevik members in the Provincial Government fluctuated, so did the general situation. The Cossacks would probably passively support Semenoff.PERSIA.Attitude of the Government. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 20th February [No. 128] that the substance of the note addressed to him had been published by the Government which had taken the opportunity to slightly emphasise its request for the withdrawal of our troops in return for the recognition of the South Persian rifles for the duration of the war. The Cabinet would never have the courage to withdraw this condition as it would be strongly insisted on by the extremist press. The action of the Government, he said, was due to the influence of the extremists who had established a committee of punishment and proposed to announce in the press that it would recommend a campaign of assassination in consequence of this one editor at least was preparing to leave.The Persian Cossacks. On the 20th February Sir G. Marling also telegraphed [No. 124] that the consul at Tabriz had reported that Colonel Mamonov, having gone to the palace by invitation, bad been relieved of the keys of the brigade stores of arms equipment and ammunition, and that it was stated that he was being detained. Vali Ahd had previously reviewed the men of the Cossack brigade, and addressing them had said that as the old Russian despotism had disappeared there was no longer any reason for thinking that the Russian officers, who had only been employed as instructors, were superior to their own Persian officers.Sir C. Marling [No. 125] understood this to be significant that the Persian Government was prepared to use force to prevent the Caucasus troops passing through Persian territory, i.e., to oppose our interests by force.The Jangalis.  Sir. C. Marling telegraphed on the 20th and 21st February [Nos. 126 and 131] that the vice-consul at i? Resht] had been informed by the Jangalis through Kars that they would consider themselves justified in taking any measures to frustrate the passage of British officers as being contrary to the independence of Persia. The vice-consul had met two Jangali representatives and had found them absolutely uncompromising. They stated that Persia would shortly receive from a neutral Power both munitions and a loan ; they had, they said, no trust in Great Britain. In regard to the threat to the British officers who at the request of the Caucasian Government were proceeding to Tiflis, Sir C. Marling had warned the Jangali leaders that they would b3 held personally responsible for any harm which might result from their action.General Dunsterville. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 22nd and 23rd February [ISos. 134 and 136] that General Dunsterville had arrived at Kasvin with some of his party and expected to leave immediately for Hamadan. .He had telegraphed that he was obliged to return to the latter place in view of the situation at Enzeli which was entirely controlled  by Red Guards  and Bolsheviks-they held all  the
7308shipping, the petrol, the telegraph, and the wireless and were working with the Jangalis. They had openly declared at a meeting of the revolutionary committee, at which he had been present, that they would resist with an armed force any attempt on the part of non-Russians to assist the Caucasus as they regarded the Caucasians as their enemies. This was at Enzeli, where the general and his companions were practically prisoners during their stay ; they had difficulty in withdrawing. General Dunsterville had been officially informed that Kuchee Khan would attack any parties coming in the future.  .In another telegram [No. 14 8] Sir C. Marling said that in view of probable disturbances in case of refusal, it seemed impossible to avoid continuing the payment of the Russian troops at Resht and Enzeli, in spite of their having held up General Dunsterville.Austrian Prisoners of War in Persia. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 23rd and 24th February [Nos. 137 and 140] that he had been informed by the Italian Minister that about 100 Austrian prisoners of war had escaped and had reached Persia. Thirty of them with two non-commissioned officers were with the Jangalis ; eighteen were at the Austrian legation and, having been furnished with arms, were being drilled; of the rest some were in Meshed or its neighbourhood, others on their way from Teheran to Mosul. The consul at Meshed had also informed him as to the arrival of fifteen of these prisoners at Bujnurd; they had announced the approaching arrival of others.LATEST  INTELLIGENCE.RUSSIA.Departure of Diplomatic Body from Petrograd. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 25th February [No. 601] that it had been decided at a meeting of the allied Ambassadors that it had become necessary for them to leave Petrograd as soon as possible. The members of the British embassy were leaving for Finland, as well as such &quot;members of the British colony as desired to do so. The embassy would be placed under the protection of the Dutch legation, and the British vice-consul would remain in it.POLAND.The Province of Kholm. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 25th February [No. 583] that M. Wielowieyski bad informed him that the. cession of the province of Kholm to Ukrainia had caused such an outcry from the Austrian Poles, that the province was to be given up again by the Rada tor inclusion in Poland.PALESTINE.Report, from General Clayton. General Clayton telegraphing on the 25th February reported as follows : British military police were replacing the guards in the holy places ; French and Italian police would protect their own institutions ; and Egyptian police would be placed on the mosque of Omar. The relations between the ecclesiastical chiefs and the military administration were most cordial.The population was grateful for what was being done for it, and was becoming increasingly friendly : it was reported from all sides that the natives greatly respected the administration, with which the headmen of villages were co-operating, so that crime was practically non-existant. Educated Moslems, however, were still disturbed at the possibility of Jewish domination, and at what they deemed the preferential treatment of Jews.Wakfs were being reinstated and placed on a sound basis. Village schools were being again staited under local arrangements. Sanitary measures were receiving careful attention. A judicial system was being established and great satisfaction had been caused by the appointment of magistra tes. Municipalities had been re-established and were at work. Trade generally was improving ; and the area under cultivation in the central and southern districts was reported to be greater than it had been at any time during the last seven years.
The Moslem population of the eastern districts of Palestine had been favourably impressed by the Arab successes east of the Jordan. The arrival of Sherif Faisal was anxiously awaited by the Arabs round Kerak and Madeba: many were joining him.PERSIA.Resignation of the Cabinet. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 26th February?-&quot;  No. 152] that the Cabinet had resigned, and ascribed its fall to the impossibility of obtaining a reply from us: in reality the chief reason was its own incapacitj7.o
