SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT. No. LVIII.Russia.No comment.Poland.The Polish problem will, perhaps, tend to become more vexatious to the Germans now that the number of non-Germans under German rule has been so considerably increased.Bulgaria.Special attention is drawn to the information regarding the Adrianople incident of October. .The Turks hate and fear the Bulgars; the Bulgars are now freed by the Roumanian peace.There is no doubt an opportunity in Bulgaria, since every Bulgarian soldier released by Roumania is an additional menace to the Turks.Turkey.Tala&apos;at&apos;s attitude is to be noticed. No reforms, no autono ay, no change, cession of all conquered territories, no mercy. We shall soon hear of dreadful atrocities perpetrated on Turks by Arabs, Nestorians, Armenians, and other peoples, and the police measures which the Turks will be obliged reluctantly to adopt.M. S.March 7, 1918.

Trotsky that peace had heen signed : also that a cessation of the offensive had been announced by the Germans. The Congress was to meet at Moscow on the 12th March.A Berlin telegram, dated Sunday, and forwarded &apos; by Reuter&apos;s Amsterdam correspondent, gives the terms of the treaty concluded between Russia and the Quadruple Alliance as follows : The peace treaty signed between Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, ancl Tm-key of the one part, and Russia on the other part, points out in the introduction that the Powers aforementioned agreed to terminate the state of war and bring about peace as quickly as possible, whereupon the plenipotentiaries signed the following-articles : Article 1. Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey of the one part, and Russia on the other part, declare the state of war between them terminated. We are resolved henceforth to live in peace and friendship with one another.Article 2. The contracting nations will refrain from all agitation or provocation against Government or State and their existence, and undertake the obligation to spare the population of the regions occupied by the Powers of the Quadruple Alliance.Article 3, sub-section (1). The regions lying west of the line agreed upon between the contracting parties and formerly belonging to Russia shall no longer be under Russian sovereignty.   The line agreed upon appears from the appended map, which, as agreed upon, forms an essential part of the peace treaty.     The fixing of the [898-85] B
line in the west shall be made by a mixed German-Russian commission. The regions in question shall have no obligation whatever towards Russia arising from their former relations with that country.(v.) Russia undertakes to refrain from all interference in the internal affairs of these territories, and to let Germany and Austria determine the future fate of these territories in agreement with their popidations.Article 4. Germany and Austria, agree, when a general peace has been concluded and Russian demobilisation has been fully carried out, to evacuate the regions east of the line designated in article 3(1) in so far as article 6 does not stipulate otherwise. Russia will do everything in her power to complete as soon as possible the evacuation of the Anatolian provinces and their orderly return to Turkey. The districts of Ardahan, Kars, and Batoum shall likewise without delay be evacuated by Russian troops. Russia shall not interfere in the reorganisation of the constitutional and international conditions of these districts, but shall leave it to the population of these districts to carry out the reorganisation in agreement with the neighbouring States, particularly Turkey.Article 5. Russia will without delay carry out the complete demobilisation of her army, inclusive of the forces newly formed by the present Government. Russia will further transfer her warships to Russian harbours, and leave them there until the conclusion of a general peace, or immediately disarm them. The warships of States continuing in a state of war with the Quadruple Alliance will be treated as Russian warships in so far as they are within Russian control. The barred zone in the Arctic continues to be in force until the conclusion of peace. An immediate start will be made with the removal of mines in the Baltic, and, in so far as Russian power extends, in the Black Sea. Commercial shipping is free in these waters, and will be immediately resumed. Mixed commissions will be appointed to draw up further regulations, especially for the announcement of routes for merchant ships. Shipping routes are to be kept permanently free from floating mines.Article 6. Russia undertakes immediately to conclude peace with the Ukrainian People&apos;s Republic, and to recognise the peace treaty between this State and the Powers of the Quadruple Alliance. Ukrainian territorj&apos;- will be immediately evacuated by Russian troops and Russian Red Guards. Russia will cease all agitation or propaganda against the Government or the public institutions of the Ukrainian People&apos;s Republic. Esthonia and Livonia, will likewise be evacuated without delay by the Russian troops and Russian Red Guards. The eastern frontier of Esthonia follows in general the line of the Narva River. The eastern frontier of Livonia runs in general through Lake Peipus and Lake Pskoff to the south-west corner of the latter, and then over Lake Luban in the direction of Levenhof on the Dvina. Esthonia and Livonia will be occupied by a German police force until their security is guaranteed by their own national institutions, and until their own State organisation is restored. Russia will forthwith release all arrested or deported inhabitants of Esthonia and Livonia and guarantee the safe return of all deported Esthonians and Livonians. Finland and the Aland Islands will also forthwith be evacuated by the Russian troops and Red Guards, and the Finnish ports by the Russian fleet and the Russian naval forces.As long as the ice prevents the Russian warships from being brought into Russian ports only small detachments will remain on board the vessels. Russia will cease all agitation or propaganda against the Government or the public institutions of Finland. The fortifications erected on the Aland Islands are to be removed with all possible despatch. A special agreement is to be made between Germany, Russia, Finland, and Sweden for the permanent non-fortification of these islands, as well as regarding other military and shipping matters. It is agreed that, at Germany&apos;s desire, other States bordering on the Baltic are also to be given a voice in the matter. [&quot; The Daily Telegraph,&quot; 5th March, 1918.]The British Embassy. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the 1st March [No. 1] that the staff of the embassy had left for ITelsingfors on the previous night. Mr. Lockhart himself was remaining in Petrograd for the present, as were Mr. Garstin and Captain Hicks. Telegraphing on the 2nd March from Helsingfors, Mr. Lindley said that he feared it would be impossible to return to Petrograd. He therefore proposed to cross to Sweden as soon as possible, but at present getting there seemed to be extremely difficult. He had been accompanied to Helsingfors by the whole staff of the embassy and a number of other British subjects.
The Bolshevik Emissaries. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir E. Howard on the 2nd March [No. 378J that the French Government had refused the Bolshevik emissaries Kameneff, Saalkind, and Savitzky admission into France and that, in consequence, they, together with another Bolshevik named Wolf, woidd leave England on the 3rd en route for Russia.Moscow.Attitude of the Moscow Bolsheviks.  Mr. Wardrop further telegraphed on the 2nd March [No. 42] that in the course of the interview with the Commissary for Foreign Affairs in regard to the Roumanian treasure, recorded below, the latter had made certain interesting; statements in regard to Germanv. He believed that the Bolsheviks of the northern capital were adopting the view of those in Moscow, who were quite prepared to carry on the war; and it was anticipated that this vieAV would prevail in the new national executive committee of the council of the whole party, which was to be elected on the 5th March. The Czech Slovaks were providing 56,0u0 men, and our help would be welcomed ; an endeavour would be made to carry on the campaign in harrnony with us.The Roumanian Treasure. On the 2nd March Mr. Wardrop telegraphed [No. 41] from Moscow that on the 27th February the French acting consul-general had been informed by the Commissary for Foreign Affairs that force would be used to open the locks of the Roumanian treasure if he would not give up the keys. After a conference between the French acting consul-general, Mr. Wardrop, and his American colleague, all three went to the commissary, from whom they obtained a signed letter giving an assurance that nothing would be removed from the place where the treasure was kept except cases which were not the property of the Roumanian Government, and which had been deposited there by the commissary for safe custody. In exchange for this letter, the keys were handed to the commissary, who promised to return them.POLAND.The Polish Army in Russia. On the 2nd March Mr. Wardrop telegraphed from Moscow (No. 43] that General Dobvor Moushnitski had asked permission for the Polish Corps to go into Poland with its arms and that the Germans had replied that it would not be allowed to go there armed or unarmed. The corps might consider itself neutral and might remain in its present quarters in the neighbourhood of Minsk, but it must receive German pay and have German instructors. Negotiations continued, but these terms had been refused.. Mr. Wa,rdrop&apos;s informant was a member of the Supreme Polish Council. Mr. Wardrop added that the Polish Council in Moscow wished M. Grabski to go to the corps, which is very isolated, for the purpose of explaining the political attitude of the Poles generally and incidentally to remove General Dobvor Moushnitski ; for which purpose they were negotiating with the Bolsheviks.On the same day Mr. Wardrop transmitted [No. 44] a telegram from Major Fitzwilliams, who also mentioned the effort being made to remove General Dobvor Moushnitski. He said too that the defection in the first Polish Corps was on the increase and that it was probable that, with the permission of Germany, the entire corps would voluntarily pass into Poland [but see what is said above as to the attitude of Germany].   The French instructors had, he said, withdrawn.SERBIA.Resignation of the Government. Sir C. des Graz telegraphed from Corfu on the 27th February [No. 32] that the Government had resigned in consequence of its having carried the election of the President of the Chamber by too small a majority. Telegraphing again on the 1st March [No. 33] he said that there was apparently a deadlock and the ministerial crisis might last some time. The old Radicals insisted that M. Pashitch should remain at the head of affairs as he represented the strongest individual party; the Opposition parties, on the other hand, refused to join any coalition Government of which he formed part.sBULGARIA.The Adrianople Incident. An agent reports that the following information has been obtained from an American missionary from Bulgaria, who confirms the information
received in regard to the incident at Adrianople in October last and gives the following details supplied by a Bulgarian colonel : For some time there had been a considerable amount of friction between the Turks and the Bulgarians in Adrianople, due, it was stated, partly on account of the Bulgarian occupation of the Kara Agatch station and partly by the Turkish jealousy of the Bulgarian occupation of old Turkish Macedonia. It appears that the Turks attacked a number of Bulgarian soldiers at the Kara Agach station, and, getting the better of them, killed and wounded a number. At this moment about 600 Bulgarian troops arrived at the station, and they immediately attacked the Turks and, according to the Bulgarian officer, &quot; routed them and captured the city.&quot;Incidents of a similar nature had taken place in the Serres-Drama region previous to the withdrawal of the Turkish troops from part of the Macedonian front.TURKEY.Propaganda, The following is a translation of an interview granted by the Turkish Minister in Berne to the editor of the &quot; Bund &quot; : Turkey is also disposed to take part in the reign of peace. The war aims of Turkey have already been set forth by the Grand Yizir and by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but it is not superfluous to state them once more to-day.We do not wish to annex an inch of foreign territory, we ask for no contributions. What we demand, and what we took part in the war for, is the integrity and independence of our country ; these are our only aims, and nothing can force us to give them up.We demand : 1. The integrity of the whole of the Ottoman Empire ; we shall never consent to cessions of territory disguised under the name of autonomy or suzerainty.2. The recognition of our sovereign rights, as this has already been accorded by our allies; in one word, we wish to be masters in our own house, politically and economically.We shall obtain what we demand or we shall succumb. Moreover, we intend to do everything in our power to adapt the conditions of life of all the Ottomans of every nationality to the ideas of modern progress, but without outside interference. We have no desire to avoid any of the exigencies of the present time.Like Austria-Hungary, we wish to be masters in our own house, and to furnish it in modern style so as to accommodate all the inhabitants of Turkey.The last declarations of the Entente statesmen show a certain progress towards a reconciliation with the ideas of the Central Powers. On the contrary, the two speeches of Mr. Lloyd George and M. Pichon, in so far as they concern Turkey, are inspired by an imperialistic spirit, under the cover of humanitarian principles. There is no sign of &amp;ny attempt to renounce all acquisitions at the expense of the Ottoman Empire.We shall under no pretext and in no form give tip the countries actually occupied by the enemy. The absolute integrity of Turkey is one of the sine qua non conditions of peace. Our allies are absolutely agreed ou this point, whatever Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Wilson may think on the subject.We are absolutely convinced that our allies, in view of the enormous sacrifices we have made during this war for the common cause, will never permit the integrity of Turkey to be tampered with, not even in the disguised form of an autonomy not under our control. On this point we count upon the fidelity of our great aides, Germany and Austria-Hungary.It is clear to all persons cajiable of reflection that the downfall of Tsarism is due not only to the vast conceptions of Hindenburg, but also in a great measure to the closing and defence of the Dardanelles by our brave soldiers of Anatolia, who thus succeeded in isolating Tsarist Russia Irom her adies.History will be able to establish the part played by Turkey in the liberation of the Russian people from the yoke of the Tsars, and of all Europe from the.peril of Tsarist autocracy.Moreover, the living rampart of our glorious soldiers at the Dardanelles, in Galicia, Macedonia and Roumania, prevented Austria from being surrounded. Turkey has contributed to the maintenance of the integrity of Austria-Hungary and has thus helped to ameliorate the general military situation of Central Europe.It is therefore in the common interests of the Quadruple Alliance to safeguard the integrity of Turkey.
5312We are also ready to form part of the society of nations and to help in the suppression-sion of militarism.For seven years we have had to bear the weight of the wars of independence which have been forced upon us. We long for a period of rest, which will give us the I opportunity of proving that our old empire is also capable of keeping the peace and of helping the development of commerce and industry.If we are at last left in peace, if foreign intrigues cease in our country, we shall shortly show that we are capable of carrying out fundamental social and economic reforms, and that our nation is worthy of living its own life in the society of nations.And finally, one word about Switzerland. We Jove this country because it has never taken part in the intrigues against Turkey, and because it is a centre of real liberty, in which several races unite in a work of peace. We hope that the Swiss will be able to take an important part in the development of the Ottoman Empire by their activity and their intelligence. Professors, traders, and industrials from Switzer-land will always be welcome in Turkey. It is to be hoped thatthey will come to us in great numbers, to collaborate with us and to get to know us better. Then it will be impossible for part of the Swiss press to publish information about Turkey which is often hostile and inexact. Fortunately these few papers do not represent Swiss public opinion as a whole, and I am convinced that in spite of a certain malevolent campaign, economic relations will develop more and more between Switzerland and Turkey.PALESTINE.Egyptian Police in Palestine [see E.R. LVII, p. 7, Report from General Clayton].  Mr. Balfour telegraphed to General Clayton on the 28th February [No 31], asking whether he could arrange for a reliable local Moslem guard to replace the Egyptian police, as this should not be used in Palestinian administration except for emergency purposes.Turkey and Palestine. An agent reports that a project is being discussed for giving Palestine autonomy on the same lines as the Lebanon, and that it was suggested that its autonomy should be guaranteed by the Powers. He does not say where or by whom this project is being discussed. &quot;ZIONISM.Germany and Zionism. An agent reports that considerable uneasiness has been caused in Berlin by the sympathy shown by the British Government for Zionism. A German delegate, Dr. Adolf Friedemann, himself a Jew, has been sent to Switzerland to organise an anti-British movement among the Jews in that country ; a movement directed against the allies and against the Zionist solution of the Palestine question now favoured by England. Dr. Friedemann has begun operations by opening a pi-ess bureau in Zurich, from which anti-British articles and items of news bearing on the Zionist question are being sent out. An abusive article against England and her intentions in regard to Zionism which recently appeared was quoted by the German press as an example of neutral opinion.Zionism in Russia. According to Reuter, the Jewish Correspondence Bureau at The Hague has received a telegram, dated the 22nd February, from its Petrograd correspondent saying that a strong Zionist movement has assumed large dimensions in Russia as the result of Mr. Balfours declaration in favour of Palestine for the Jews. The movement (says the correspondent) has aroused warm sympathy for England, and is strongly opposed by the Bolsheviks.The correspondent adds that the commissaries have appointed M. Dimenstin Minister for Jewish Affairs. This Minister stated that his task would be to combat Zionism, especially among soldiers. The Zionist Petrograd newspaper, &quot;Tageblatt,&quot; has been suspended and the editors put into gaol. These measures have caused much excitement among the Jews.    &quot;Manchester Guardian,&quot; 27th March, 1918.]China and Zionism. Dr. Weizman has received the following telegram from a correspondent in Shanghai : Sandelson writes that China is prepared to endorse England&apos;s declaration as to a Jewish Palestine, but the official announcement has been delayed pending the British Minister at Pekin hearing from the. Foreign Office authorising him to take official cognisance thereof[898-85] &quot; C
CAUCASUS.The Turks and the Caucasus. An agent reports that a Turkish diplomat of high standing told him that his Government had decided to occupy that portion of the Russian Caucasus which was inhabited by Moslems, for which purpose the general staff was making the necessary dispositions. The Armenians, who were regarded as an obstacle in that region, would be swept aside.SIBERIA.The Bolshevik Attack. Sir J. Jordan telegraphed from Pekin on the 3rd March [No. 199] that news had been received by the Russian Legation of a successful attack on Dauria station by Bolsheviks and enemy prisoners, who were said to have artillery and machine guns.] Semenoff had retired to the next station ; his casualties had been slight.TURKESTAN.Anti-British Propaganda. An agent reports that the agents of the committees of the CUP. in Turkestan are in close relations with Shaykh Abidouillah and his son. The Turkish agents are developing a very violent anti-British campaign, stating that it is Great Britain&apos;s desire to enslave all the inhabitants of the district.PEBSIA.Financing Russian Troops. Beplying to Sir C. Marling&apos;s. remark as to the continued payment of Russian troops [E. R. LVII, p. 7], Mr. Balfour telegraphed on the 1st March [No. 121] that having regard to the behaviour of these troops he was unable to authorise a continuance of the payments.Persians and German Anti-British Propaganda in Central Asia. An agent reports that Hussein Khuli Khan, Bersian Minister in Berlin, has given Germany much help in the matter of propaganda in Bersia ancl Central Asia. In accordance with his advice several Persians have arrived in Berlin for instruction, after which they will return to their native land and work tip the necessary interest in the Turanian move-ment. The funds for this are supplied by Germany on the lavish and thorough scale on which she always conducts such work.Disturbance at Tabriz. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 28th February and the 1st March [Nos. 163 and 167] that the acting consul at Tabriz feared that a disturbance which had occurred at Urumia might cause serious trouble. An attempt was made to disarm two Syrians belonging to tlie Syrian battalion, which then attacked the Cossack barracks and abused the Cossack officers as German spies. Fighting ensued and asted two days ; about twenty were killed on each side.Bolsheviks and Jangalis. Sir C. Maiding telegraphed on the 27th February [Nos. 156 and 157] that the British vice-consul at Kasvin had reported on good authority, though confirmation had not so far been received, that a commission of 120 Bolsheviks and 500 Jangalis, accompanied by one Turkish and two German officers, would proceed from Resbt to Kasvin without delay. Inflammatory anti-British telegrams were being circulated throughout the country by the Jangalis.Telegraphing again dn the 3rd March [No. 173], he said that the vice-consul at Resht had that day informed him that on the previous night the Persian Cossacks had handed over their guns, rifles, munitions &amp;c, to the Jangalis ; their Russian officers had been accomplices, and he believed had been well paid by the band.
r313LATEST INTELLIGENCE.RUSSIA.Tlie Present Situation. Mr. Lockhart telegraphed on the 5th March [Nos. 9 and 10] that M. Trotsky had told him that some action which would make a declaration of war on the part of Germany inevitable would be taken at the congress meeting at Moscow on the 12th ; but for this policy to succeed, some apparent support on the part of the allies was necessary.Mr. Lockhart thought the position by no means hopeless; some form of resistance was certain, so strong was the revulsion of feeling against Germany. In spite of the fact that the demobilization of the army had been ordered, the whole population was being armed with as little loss of time as possible.POLAND.Desertion of Austrian Polish Brigade.- Lord Bertie transmitted [No. 332] on the 5th March a telegram received from the four allied Ministers at Jassy in regard to a Polish brigade which had deserted from the Austrian army. An officer of this force, which was then in Bessarabia, had been sent by its commander to the allied Ministers, and the President of the Polish Ministers on that front accompanied him. These delegates informed the Ministers as to the indignation which had been aroused by the Ukraine peace terms, and insisted on the advantages which would accrue to the Entente if this sentiment were exploited. They urged that, with the utmost publicity, a solemn collective declaration should be made by the Allies to the effect that one of the essential aims of the war was the restoration of Poland, geographical and ethno-, graphical, with access to the sea. They pointed out that a considerable proportion of the Austrian forces on the Italian front were Poles, and argued that such a declaration would have a happy effect in that quarter.SERBIA.Peace Suggestions. Sir W. Townley telegraphed on the 5th March [No. 941] that lie had learnt that the Austrian Government had been approached in regard to peace-on the basis of the union of Serbia and Montenegro, some territorial concessions in Macedonia, and a port on the sea; and that the reply given to the emissary of the Serbian Royal House who had acted as intermediary was that the question of Macedonia must be settled with Bulgaria, but that there was no objeciion to the other two proposals. The Austrian Minister added that Hungary had intimated that she must have Belgrade.ROUMANIA.Treaty of Peace. Reuter transmits from Amsterdam a Bucharest telegram of the 5th March, received via Vienna, which says : At Buftea this evening the following preliminary treaty was signed between Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey of the one part and Roumania of the other part: Animated by a common wish to terminate the state of war and restore peace between Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey of the one part, and Roumania of the other part, the signatories, namely, the Plenipotentiary for Germany, Herr von Kuhlmann, for Austria-Hungary, Count Czernin, for Bulgaria, Dr. Momichiloff, the Vice-President of the Sobranje, and for Turkey, Talaat Pasha, of the one part, and Roumanian Plenipotentiary, M. Argeniojanu, of the other part, after an examination of their full powers, have agreed that the armistice treaty signed at Focsani- on the 9th December, 1917, having been denounced on the 2nd March, and having expired on the 5th March, 1918, at 12 noon, a fourteen, days&apos; truce is to run from midnight, the 5th March, 1918, with a period of three clays for its denunciation. Complete agreement exists between the signatories that a final peace is to be concluded within this period on the basis of the followiuo; agreement: I. Roumania cedes to the Allied Powers the Dobrudsha as far as the Danube.II. The Powers of the Quadruple Alliance shall provide for the maintenance of a train route for Roumania via Constanza to the Black Sea.
* In a telegram sent on the 5th March by the allied Ministers in Jassy it was stated that in tho-rectification of frontier three points were aimed it: the Iron Gates, the Dornavatra district, and the Jiu valley. ......III. The frontier rectifications demanded by Austria-Hungary on the Austro-Hungarian-Roumanian frontier are accepted in principle by Roumania.*TV. The economic measures corresponding to the situation are likewise conceded in principle.V. The Roumanian Government undertakes to demobilize immediately at least eight divisions of the Roumanian army. The control of the demobilization will be undertaken jointly by the Higher Command of Field-Marshal von Mackensen&apos;s Army Group and the Roumanian Chief Army Command. As soon as peace is restored between Russia and Roumania the remaining parts of the Roumanian army will also demobilize in so far as they are not required to maintain security on the Russo-Roumaniari frontier.VI. Roumanian troops must immediately evacuate the territory of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy occupied by them.VII. The Roumanian Government undertakes to support with all its power the railway transport of troops of the allied Powers through Moldavia and Bessarabia to Odessa.VIII. Roumania undertakes immediately to dismiss officers of Powers which are at. war with the Quadruple Alliance who are still in the Roumanian service.   A safe conduct is assured these officers by the Quadruple Alliance.This treaty enters into operation immediately. In witness whereof the Pleni-potentiaries signed and sealed this treaty (drawn up in quintuple original) at Buftea on the 5th March, 1918.-[&quot; The Morning Post,&quot; March 7, 1918.]
