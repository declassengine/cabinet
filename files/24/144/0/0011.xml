SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN   REPORT No. XXXVI.Russia.Political events continue to drift from crisis to crisis. There is no use in commenting on the passionate outcries of speakers like M.. Kerensky and his opponents. The really important news is to be found in the last sentence of the latest intelligence from Russia (see p. 6). This sentence runs as follows : &quot; The news of the 29th September from Tashkent and other places is very bad, and.anarchy appears to be spreading.&quot; There is every indication that the pan-Turanian movement is at last getting to work in Turkestan, a id it is submitted in all seriousness- that we may not be at any great historical distance from seeing a powerful Turkish State menacing Afghanistan. This movement will not prooably tend to anarchy, as the telegram quoted suggests, ,but to aggressive well-organised militarism based upon national sentiment and fanaticism.Egypt.The Khedives departure for Turkey is to be noted. His future appointment as governor-general of an autonomous Arab Syria appears to be indicated. We have been warned of this contingency in the past.Bolo Pasha.The arrest of Bolo Pasha is important.   Bolo would appear to have been the agent through whom pacificism, cosmopolitan financialism, Tureophilism, industrial unrest,-and other enemy war assets were fostered in allied countries.M. S.October 5, 1917.

Kerensky, who was just back from the front, would address a Democratic Congress on the next day and explain the manner in which the Coalition Government was to be constructed.The Ambassador reports that the papers of the 26th September announced the resignation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs ; the latter, however, informed him that this was not true, and that he had only stated in the Cabinet the sole terms on which he could remain in office. M. Kerensky is stated to be in disagreement with the Ministry of War, owing to his refusal to suspend negotiations with the Moscow Cadets or to consult Congress with regard to the composition of the Cabinet.On the 28th September &quot;No. 1529] the Ambassador reported that the meeting of the Democratic Congress, held the day before, had appeared largely adverse to the Bolchevists, though it was not evident how far they supported the Coalition Govern-ment, in which the&quot; Cadets are to be specially represented, and M. Kerensky.; the latter, at the conclusion of his speech, was well received, chiefly, it was thought, owing to irritation at the continued Bolchevist interruptions. His speech was, on the whole, disappointing; he had painted the situation in gloomy colours, citing the grave political outlook in Finland and the traitorous&apos; behaviour of the Baltic Fleet without, [898-631 C
however, submitting the remedies he proposed to adopt. In the course of a conversation with Sir George the Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted the deplorable state of the fleet. The situation, however, should not be judged by the attitude of Petrograd, where, though there might be more disturbances, opinion was not representative of the provinces, which were now so incensed against Petrograd that representatives of co-operative organisations, accounting for 15 million odd members, had decreed that they would withhold their food supplies unless the government by Petrograd Soviet was suspended. There seemed some possibility of the Government and capital being transferred to Moscow.The Russian Government [Stockholm No. 2888 of the 1st October] are raising difficulties in the way of falling into line with the decision of the British, American, and French Governments to stop all imports to Scandinavia. The head of the Economic Section of the Russian Foreign Office, who is about to visit London, will be able to discuss this question with His Majesty&apos;s Government.There are persistent reports [Foreign Office No. 2047 of the 2nd October] to the effect that at a conference between Austrian and Prussian Red Cross delegates at Stockholm it was resolved to establish a neutral zone in the neighbourhood of Pinsk for the exchange of prisoners of war.The Bolchevists [Petrograd No. 1536 of the 29th September] continue to be a source of grave anxiety. Lenin, who is supposed to be in Petrograd, has issued an appeal urging the proletariat to rise against the bourgeoisie, even declaring that civil war was preferable to war at the front. There would probably be trouble, but the Government has taken all necessary measures for the maintenance of order.At a united meeting on the 14th September of Socialist parties and local revolutionary organisations, it was decided that no bourgeosie should be included in the Government; resolutions were also passed for the abolition of the death penalty, the democratization of the army by an elected committee of supervision, and the Government peace campaign without indemnities or annexations supported by an active foreign policy against the Allies of Imperialism.M. Albert Thomas declares [No. 1003 of&quot; the 30th September] in the &quot; Information &quot; his belief that M. Kerensky will triumph over Maximalists. It is, however, indispensable and urgent that Allied Governments should do their duty towards Russia. Some allow themselves unconsciously to be dominated by a sentimental hostility to revolution. The press should avoid offending Russian susceptibilities. Rumours have been spread in Russia that Allies think of separate peace at Russia&apos;s expense, and a conference with the Russian Government is urgently required. Terestchenko had thought of holding one for revision of war aims; it should be held to. organise war and continue struggle. Perhaps the western Governments would then better appreciate the enormous effort accomplished by the men of the Russian revolution and would be less inclined to make useless remonstrances. Above all we must help Russians to organise themselves. It is vital for the cause of the Allies that during the coming months active, intelligent, and affectionate collaboration should without delay support efforts of Kerensky and Verekowsky. Russian history has always been full of extraordinary contrasts. A few months after the lamentable collapse of 1915, Broussiloff made his victorious attack in May 1916.   Revolutionary Russia is capable of a similar effort.In the full account [Petrograd No. 1528 of the 28th September] now to hand from Sir G. Buchanan, he telegraphed that the Pan-Russian Conference of organised democracy opened with an attendance exceeding 1,200 delegates. The President, M. Chkheidze, declared that the Conference had been summoned to draft a programme&apos; which would ensure a united authority capable of rescuing the country from its present lamentable and dangerous condition to which it had been reduced by party politics and class antagonism. He expressed the opinion that this jsrogramme should be based on the platform enunciated at the Moscow Conference.M. Kerensky, whose appearance was greeted with loud applause, made a speech, described by the press as characteristically impromptu deliverance, necessarily discon-nected, and given under great stress of emotion, which on several occasions threatened to overcome him. He was frequently interrupted by extremist elements, which showed considerable antagonism towards him, but the majority were clearly sympathetic, and each disturbance met with loud counter-cheers. At the close of his speech the signal for an ovation was taken up by the crowd outside when he left the building. His speech dealt mainly with the KornilofF incident. After briefly summarising the causes which led up to the plot, he declared that the Government had been long aware of its existence, and had taken every step in the power of the Cabinet to avert it, but that  reactionary Conservative and Military parties had taken advantage of each
j succeeding difficulty in which, the Government found itself ,to make fresh demands, and had at least on one occasion warned him that no further changes were to be made without the assent of the Commander-in-Chief at Headquarters; he defended the introduction of the death penalty, which he declared was unanimously approved by the whole Cabinet; he expressed his confidence in the Army, and the determination of the Government to continue the policy hitherto followed, adding that it would not be frightened by any threats from the right or from the left, but would rely on the common-sense support of reorganised democracy to re-establish law and order throughout the country, and to suppress the ever-increasing growth of anarchy in the provinces, as well as to create the military and naval forces based upon democratic principles capable of defeating the foreign foe, who were already knocking at the door of Petrograd and daily drawing closer to the Gulf of Finland.M. Kerensky was followed by the Minister of War, who made a powerful speech that was heard with rapt attention and loudly applauded. He began by emphatically denying that England or France intended to conclude peace with Germany at the expense of Russia, and added that, on the contrary, they were determined to support Russia in her hour of trial with ail the means at their disposal. He then detailed &quot;the proposed scheme of army reorganisation, and insisted that the war must be carried on until the Allies were convinced that the peace which all await would be a lasting peace ensuring real freedom. He spoke of the present lamentable condition of the army, the distrust of the men towards their officers, the prevalence of desertion, and general disorganisation ; and expressed the conviction that discipline was absolutely necessary, and that Russian democracy would exert all possible influence to re-establish order in the ranks and to recreate the army on democratic principles.M. Chernoff then spoke, attributing the failure of the present Cabinet to effect any real reform to the presence in the Government of non-democratic elements ; he declared that the coalition with the bourgeoisie and propertied classes had proved unsuccessful, that further co-operation with the Cadet party was impossible, and that only a Government constituted exclusively of representatives of organised democracy would meet the present situation.Other speakers of the Bolchevist party spoke in the same strain, attacking M. Kerensky.M. Bogdanov expressed his conviction that only a strict observance of the programme formulated at the Moscow Conference could save the country.The last speaker was M. Tseretelli, who was met with thunderous applause. He defended the past policy of the Government, whose acts, he maintained, would be justly appraised by future generations ; he declared that only irresponsible elements of the bourgeoisie and propertied classes took any active part in the Korniloff plot. The adventure was largely due to the attitude of the Bolchevists. He said that the time had come to create an authority answering to the aspirations of combined democracy as represented by the present conference, and that this authority must carry out in full the programme put forward by the Government declarations of May, July, and August. In conclusion, M. Tseretelli, referring to questions of foreign policy, declared that at the present moment, when the international situation was hourly becoming more acute and the peoples of the belligerents were exhausted by war, inactivity and lack of initiative on the part of revolutionary Russia constituted an act of treason towards the cause of the democratic countries at large. The actual existence of Russia depended upon an active international j)policy, direct relations with the Allies for the purpose of estab-lisbing a platform which would enable Russia to act in complete accord in the question of a universal peace. He further urged that full use should be made of all the resources of a reorganised Russia.A proposal [Petrograd despatch of the 7th September] has been made by the Russian Transport that a railway junction line should he made between Herat and Kush. This line would link up Calcutta -with Russia, and would considerably lighten the pressure on the Vladivostock and Archangel routes.The workmen [No. 1543 of the 30th September, 1917 j in the factory districts declined to come out, though there was some agitation. It is probable that the Democratic Congress will remain in session at least two days more. The concensus of opinion, except for the Bolchevists, who are in a weak minority, is in favour of a stable and strong Government, but it is not yet certain whether there will be a majority in favour of a Coalition Government representing ail parties, or of a Government composed exclusively of the more moderate Socialist groups. It is to be feared that no Govern-ment without a strong military backing can at present be regarded as stable, and it seems probable that crisis will continue to follow crisis for some time yet.[898-63] B 2
POLAND.The United States Government [Washington No. 2847 of the 27th September] have now consented to allow the Polish National Council in Chicago to recruit Poles for a Polish Army in France. They propose beginning at once, and ask to be allowed to recruit among the Poles in their own district.The Polish National Council has now been recognised [F.O. No. 2405 of the 1st October] by the French Government.ROUMANIA.The American Minister, Mr. Voppicka [Sir G. Barclay&apos;s No. 584 of the 30th September] has returned to Roumania with a strong American Red Cross Mission, which has given fresh heart to Jassy. He has been furnished by the Roumanian Government with an aide-memoire regarding transport and other requirements, which explains that, owing to the reduction of Roumanian producing power by an enemy occupation of two-thirds of her territory, the tonnage facilities before agreed upon are no longer sufficient. Unless the proposed measures are taken without delay and in their integrity, all isolated measures to supply Roumania will be useless.. Permission has been granted [Petrograd No. 1530 of the 1st October] to the Roumanian Government to recruit from amongst the Transylvanian prisoners now in Russia the 30,000 men they have requested.TURKEY.The &quot;Kolnische Zeitung,&quot; No. 934, the 29th September [The Hague No. 3078 of the 1st October], publishes a telegram from Constantinople which says that all Turkish papers are discussing the Grand Viziers speech at the Congress of the Party of Union and Progress, and emphasising its importance. They emphasise the fact that Turkey&apos;s war aim is to preserve her independence and inviolability. The deportation of Armenians was carried out from considerations of State and reasons concerning the safety of the army, for Government could not allow this element, which enjoyed all privileges, to become a danger to its existence, owing to the influence of national sentimentalists egged on by Russia and England. Concerning the evacuation of certain towns in Palestine, whose population was largely Jewish, this was necessary for the safety of the population itself. Nothing, however, could justify the persecution of Catholics in Ireland by English, of the Huguenots by French, the lynching of niggers and persecu-tion of Mormons in America. Americans, Indians, Egyptians, Boers, and Irish know what it means to be under British protection or supremacy.The ex-Khedive is apparently completing his preparations for an immediate departure to Constantinople [Berne No. 750 of the 27th September, 1917]. He recently withdrew a large sum of money from a Berne bank, and sent a prominent Egyptian Nationalist to Lausanne, to visit the Egyptian students there, as also in Geneva, and to strengthen their loyalty in the Khedive of Egypt, still recognised as such by the Central Powers and Turkey.It is reported [Berne No. 878 of the 27th September, 1917) that Jemal Pasha has returned to Constantinople and will leave for the Gaza front almost immediately. If he does the latter, friction between himself and Falkenhayn is anticipated.Four Greek consuls are being detained by the Porte [Athens No. 1851 of the 27th September, 1917], on the pretext that Sulayman Bey has not yet been released. The Porte has been informed [F.O. No. 1304 Athens of the 28th September, 1917] by His Majesty&apos;s Government, through a neutral source, that the Bey, actually in Egypt, will be sent back to Turkey as soon as possible.His Majesty&apos;s Government have informed Porte [No. 2696, Haig of the 1st October] that if the Porte will repatriate invalid British prisoners of war they will also repatriate an equal number of invalid Turkish prisoners of war.The Grand Vizier [F.O, No. 2687 to The Hague] has been informed that only by acceding to our proposals in advance can he hope to secure the early release of Ayoub Sabri.SIAM.Mr. Lyle telegraphs [No. 160 of the 1st October] that the Siamese Government propose adopting the French system of restricting the privilege of cypher telegraphing to the Allies. They contemplate the despatch of motorist and aviation detachments to the Western Front.
I EGYPT.Sir R. Wingate reports [No. 1017 of the 28th September] that difficulties are arising in connection with the calling up of the Greeks in Egypt for military service as regards Macedonians, who, though of Greek race, are none the less local Egyptian subjects. It is proposed to recognise as a Greek national, together with his wife and minor children, any person who enrolled himself recently as a Venizelist, and who now joins the Greek Army voluntarily.From Tripoli Said Muhammad Idrisi has written to Sir R. Wingate [No. 1022 of the 80th September] asking for a British representative to be present at his forth-coming meeting with an Italian Agent, and for His Majesty&apos;s Governments good offices in inducing the Italian Government to withdraw a customs post recently estab-lished near Sollum. Idrisi has been informed, in reply, that we are glad to hear he is to meet an Italian Agent to discuss subjects of mutual interest, but that we are unable at this short notice to send, uninvited by the Italian Government, a suitable official, as there is no question arising of any matter affecting our agreement with him, and that we have informed the Italian Government of his views and requests, as we desire to promote a good understanding between our Allies and him.The Khedive [Berne No. 896 of the 1st October, 1917] has concluded his negotiations with Talaat and leaves almost immediately fur Constantinople, whence it is hoped he will be able to provide us with military and general information. He has already sold a property near Constantinople really worth about 5.000Z. for 200,OOOZ. The Turks have also promised to pay him 100,OOOL a year until Egypt is reconquered, in which case to replace him on the throne, the return of all his properties, and, in the event of England retaining Egypt, a pension of 24,000L a year from the German and Turkish Governments. The arrangement, apparently, is for him to get into touch with the King of the Hejaz from Aleppo. Pressure will then be brought to win over the King and other Arab chiefs. It is clear that the Khedive&apos;s intention is to keep in with both sides. As he believes in the final victory .pf Great Britain, he is prepared to give information. He stated that the Turks appear to have confidence for successes on both Eastern fronts.ARABIA.General Clayton [Egypt No. 1023 of the 30th September, 1917] has visited the nucleus Arab legion formed from prisoners of war now encamped at Ismailia. He Teports that although the men may develop into fair fighting material, the officers are unskilled and undisciplined and apparently without enthusiasm ; in addition to these defects they exhibit their usual love of politics. A maximum of 1,000 is hoped for in the near future, although up to the present not more than half that number are assembled.ADEN.Sir Reginald Wingate [No. 1025 of the 1st October], in making urgent recom-mendations for financial and other assistance to the Idrisi of Asir, points out that these are little more than palliatives to a situation that becomes constantly more disastrous to our prestige in Southern Arabia. He emphasises the necessity of overthrowing the Turkish army in Yemen, and so destroying Turkish domination over this important region.PERSIA.Sir C. Marling telegraphs [No. 323 of the 30th September] that the Russian Government has received from Persia a note contending that since agreements extorted by force should not be valid, the 1907 Convention, and much of that of 1911, should be cancelled, or at any rate modified. His Majesty&apos;s Governments support has been requested for the above note, to which the Russian Government propose replying that they are at present too much preoccupied to discuss such questions, and must postpone their consideration until the end of the war.The Russian forces of Persia [Sir G. Buchanan, No. 1532 of the 29th September] are experiencing great difficulty owing to the refusal of the Persians to accept roubles, and they request that the Imperial Bank of Persia may be supplied at once with gold in all the purchase rules.   The matter is under the consideration of the Treasury^The Persian Cabinet [Tehran No. 322 of the 28th September, 1917], under the pressure of financial stringency, are apparently desirous of coming to an understanding with us. Sir C. Marling proposes to request the Persian Government to recognise the Southern Persian Rifles, and at the same time to open conversation with a view to granting them a loan.
LATEST INTELLIGENCE.RUSSIA.Sir G. Buchanan telegraphs [No. 1 545 of the 1st October] that the new Govern-ment is now definitely constituted, though until the Democratic Congress has been closed its composition will not be definitely announced. The War Committee, composed of the present council of five, will continue to act under M. Kerensky, assisted by an Economic Committee containing Ministers of Supplies, Labour, Commerce, and Finance.-Sir William Wiseman telegraphs from New York that the Russian representative there has stated that the Russian Government are embarrassed by the lack of Allied sympathy. They assert that England really wants a reactionary Government in Russia again. To these allegations His Majesty&apos;s Government have prepared a telegram to the effect that England has both officially and unofficially welcomed the entrance of&quot; a democratic Power into the struggle against Prussian autocracy. It was only when the Revolution began to tend towards anarchy that it was felt that licence should be curbed and discipline re-established in the army. His Majesty&apos;s Government are entirely opposed to reaction and will continue to support with all their sympathy and aid any Russian Government endeavouring to secure the defeat of German militarism.The news [Sir G:. Buchanan No. 1536 of the 29th September] from Tashkent and other places in the interior is very bad, and anarchy appears to be spreading.ROUMANIA.M. Take Jonescu has addressed a long telegram [Sir G. Barclay No. 586 of the 30th September] to Mr. Lloyd George pointing out the grave financial situation of Roumania sand begging him to extend all possible assistance to the country.TURKEY.An interesting telegram from Sir H. Rumbold [No. 883 of the 3rd October] conveys the views of the German Professor Jaffa, editor of two well-known German periodicals, at present staying in Geneva. v His views may be taken as representative of a large body of liberal opinion in Germany.As regards Turkey, the professor stated that the Central Powers had promised their help to assist in recapturing Mesopotamia. The ultimate view of Mesopotamia was now more or less immaterial to Germany. In pre-war days, the Baghdad Railway had been looked upon by the Deutsch Bank leaders as having latent commercial potentialities, but in the present circumstances, Germany would prefer to join hands with England and France in the development of the country. The existing &quot; Berlin to Persia &quot; propaganda w7as really only intended to keep up the moral of the German people. Generally, there appeared to be a disposition to sacrifice Turkey unless she was able to reconquer Mesopotamia and Arabia. The internationalisation of the Straits appeared to be acceptable to Germany. Germany&apos;s present object was neither Petrograd nor Odessa, but peace. She hoped to see Turkey take Mesopotamia, and Roumania capitulate, but was not apparently prepared to make any superhuman effort in this direction. According to the professor, the Central Powers&apos; effort in support of Turkey wrould not be a really serious one, Germany having lost her interest in Mesopotamia, and maintaining that she had already saved Turkey from Russia.EGYPT.Sir H. Rumbold [No. 907 of the 3rd October] reports that according to his latest information the intention of the Khedive is to form an &quot; Egyptian&quot; Government at Aleppo, composed of Egyptian notables at present in Constantinople.The Paris &quot; Matin&quot; of the 3rd October [Bertie No. 1020 of the 3rd October] has published a telegram from Saddik Pasha, from Geneva, protesting against the part attributed to him in the Bolo revelations, and declaring that any relations he had with him&apos;were by order of the Khedive, whose official he then was. Saddik informed the &quot; Matin &quot; correspondent at Geneva that Bolo in 19 1.6 promised the Khedive to recapture , for him all his authority at Cairo, and to obtain the dismissal of British agents displeasing to him.-&quot;ARABIA. . .The Sherif of Mecca has sent his congratulations to the British Government and General Maude upon the recent victory gained at Ramadia.PRINTED AT TUB FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. R. HARRISON.-5/10/1917.
