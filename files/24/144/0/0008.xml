SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT No. XXXIII.Russia.According to the latest telegrams, General Korniloff has actually surrendered, and the episode is at an end.The whole of the Russian news should he read, as this report contains a good summary&apos;of the Korniloff-Kerensky affair. It is to be noted that revolution in Russia is working on rather different grounds than revolutions in other countries heretofore. The autocratic power of the Emperor, which provided the moral sanction for adminis-tration, has disappeared and nothing has taken its place. In America a.nd France, the two countries where revolutions have worked vT,he successors to power invented or retained a moral sanction sufficient to enable them to carry on the ordinary routine of life. In Russia this is not the case; the Duma is doomed because it was instituted by the Emperor, the Soviet is manifestly merely an assembly of sel appointed personages, and the Constituent Assembly remains a dr.-am. The Russian Revolution is therefore a grand negation of authority and lacks any positive purpose or intention.Amidst such fundamental and primitive chaos it is next to impossible to ascertain what has actually occurred and quite impossible to say what may occur. The great weakness of both parties is the really outstanding symptom; it is manifest that there have been moments when General Korniloff could have taken Petrograd with a very-small effort; on the other hand, it would seem that he has been unable to exert even that slight amount of energy.Roumania.The Roumanian situation dovelopes on tragic lines. The Roumanians, who have left a prosperous and civilised country behind them, are driven into a poor and barbarous one; it is remarkable that they&apos; continue the struggle. Evidently they rely on the Powers of the Entente, other than Russia, ultimately seeing them through.Arabia.The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; of Friday published an excellent photograph of an Egyptian officer, with the following printed beneath it : &quot; Egyptian Officer Honoured. El Lena Sayed Ali Pasha, in command of Egyptian troops, who took the cities of Mecca and Taiff with 4,800 Turkish prisoners, has received the C.M.G.&quot;This is about the best example o: the wrong way to do it we have had since 1915. It will enable the Committee of Union and Progress agents in India and elsewhere to say that we decorate with Christian crosses, and dedicate to Christian saints, perjured Moslems who defile the Holy Places at our instigation. The galling part of it is that the statement not only comes out in-our own papers, but will be strictly in accordance with facts; enemy propaganda based on the whole truth and nothing but the truth is more difficult to combat than that which contains a tincture of falsehood.M.

Buchanan telegraphed [No. 1413] in regard to the events which led to M. Kerensky&apos;s assumption of a dictatorship and to his dismissal of General Korniloff. M. Tereschenko had informed him that on the (?) 8th September M. Kerensky had, through M. Lvov, formerly Procurator of the Holy Synod, r-received a notification from General Korniloff that he had decided to declare himself dictator, as, in the opinion of those with whom he was in contact, Russia could only be saved by means of a military dictatorship. He hoped that-M. Kerensky would at once go to headquarters to accept the office of Minister of Justice under him, and that M. Savenkoff would do the same and be his Minister for War. General Korniloff apparently confirmed by telephone what had been said. All the Ministers, at a Cabinet Council which had been hastily summoned, declared General Korniloff to have been guilty of treason. The Ministers resigned, and it was deoided to appoint a committee with dictatorial powers. M. Savenkoff was appointed Governor-General of Petrograd and martial law had been proclaimed. M. Tereschenko hoped that the crisis would be settled without bloodshed, as the Government could count upon the Soviet and the best elements of the moderate parties.[The greater number of the telegrams from Russia arrived so late in the week that they must be looked for under &quot; Latest Intelligence.&quot;]The. Arrest of the Grand Dukes [Eastern Report XXXII, p. 6]. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 5th September [No. 1389] that M. Tereschenko had informed him that the intrigues of the Princess Paley (wife of the Grand Duke Paul) and her son had compromised the grand-dukes. Their intrigues had for Object the return of the Emperor or, failing that, the accession of the Grand Duke Dmitri, and a[898-60] B
number of letters and cypher messages had been found. M.. Tereschenko did not think that the grand-dukes would be under arrest for very long ; and the arrest was only domiciliary.Exchange of Prisoners of War with Austria [Eastern Report XXXI, p. 2 ; XXXII, p. 3]. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed on the 5th September [No.. 785] that, according to a letter received from Prince Charles of Sweden (so Lord Acton had been informed by Professor Naville), about the 22nd&apos; August the Russian and Austrian delegates signed an agreement, at Stockholm, for the mutual repatriation of prisoners of war. It was resolved to effect the repatriation direct, across the battle front, as Germany had refused to grant transport ships immunity from submarines. On the 6th September Mr. Balfour instructed Sir G. Buchanan [No. 1884] to inquire into the truth of the latter statement.Finland.German Propaganda. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed on the 10th September [No. 807] saying that Mr. Harte, the secretary of the international committee of the Y.M.C. A., estimated that there were about 6.,000 Finns serving in the German army and that he wished the Foreign Office to know that he had learnt that they were to be sent back to Finland, as civilians, for propaganda purposes to work against Russia. Sir E. Howard telegraphed on the 11th September [No. &quot;2698] that M. Lednicki, the president of the Polish conference in Stockholm, was very pessimistic about the situation in Finland : pro-German sentiments were quite openly displayed, and in a public restaurant he had heard the German national anthem sung.POLAND.The Polish Conference at Stockholm. Mr: Balfour telegraphed to Sir E. Howard on the 7th September [No. 2684] that Count Sobanski could not reach Stockholm till next week and that he desired that reliable people should be warned that Great Britain and France were prepared to recognise the Polish National Committee [Eastern Report XXXII, p. 3] so soon as our allies had agreed to do the same. M. Dobiecki should be asked to prolong the discussions till the arrival of Count Sobanski who had represented to Mr. Balfour that the conference might mislead Polish opinion, its leading members being identified either with the late Council of State, with its German associa-tions, or with the pacifist tendencies of the Provisional Government. There was a danger that it might usurp the position which should accrue to the Polish National Committee. Sir E. Howard replied to this next day [No. 2675] saying that it would be a mistake on his part to speak to M. Dobiecki in the sense suggested, as there was little to be gained by sowing dissension among the leading Poles, who were now to a great extent working in unison. He thought that Count Sobanski&apos;s suspicions of M. Lednicki, the chairman of the conference, were unfounded. He knew that among the members of the Polish National Committee, who represented the aristocratic party, there was a good deal of jealousy of M. Lednicki, who had struck him and his colleagues as being not only the reverse of anti-Russian and pro-German, but also the ablest of the Polish leaders. He said that his party had from the first desired complete independence, and he had opposed the idea of satisfaction with autonomy under Russia which had been supported by the National Committee. Sir E. Howard added that M. Lednicki hoped that the different Polish parties would be able to work together for the independence of Poland : he deplored their jealousies. That the allied Governments should be in touch with representatives of the Polish Left as well as with the National Committee was his desire.Telegraphing again on the 11th September [No. 2698] Sir E. Howard said that M. Lednicki had given no indication of his alleged pacifist tendencies. He had opposed the formation of a separate army for Poland in Russia, because he feared that the Russian authorities would always be inclined to give more favourable treatment to their own men and would not properly supply the Polish army with munitions and food.The Proposed Regency. Sir E. Howard telegraphed on the 8th September [No. 2673] that he understood from M. Lednicki that the Poles who were gathered in conference at Stockholm were on the whole not opposed to a regency of three probably the Archbishop of Warsaw, Prince Lubomirski, syndic of that place, and Marshal Niemojowski, president of the late Polish Provisional Council; the first two were said to
have objected to the third on the ground that he was frankly pro-German and would compromise them. The Poles themselves seemed to favour the idea of the triumvirate, feeling that they would be safe in the hands of the archbishop and the syndic, but the Italian Minister had expressed himself very strongly against their acquiescence, which he said would be tantamount to the acknowledgment by Germany alone of a Kingdom of Poland, whilst whatever power the regency itself might have would be with the consent of the Germans. Sir E. Howard therefore asked for instructions in regard to the language he should use.Russia and Poland. Sir E. Howard telegraphed on the 8th September [No. 2673] that he understood that M. Lednicki before leaving Petrograd for the Polish conference received from M. Tereschenko a letter for communication to the Poles whom he would meet in Stockholm, in which it was stated that the principles of the proclamation made to the Poles in the month of March were maintained by the Provisional Government, and that this Government was all the more sensible of any manifestation of friendship because of its complete understanding of the difficulty of the Polish position.Poland and the Allies. In the same telegram [No. 2673] Sir E. Howard said that the Polish leaders had expressed great anxiety that the allied Governments should make a joint definite statement that at the peace congress the Polish question would be treated as an international matter, and that the financial position of the new kingdom should be regulated by an international agreement to save it from being economically dependent on Germany.ROUMANIA.Evacuation. Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 31st August [No. 509] that in an interview with the Prime Minister the latter emphasised the urgency of the question raised in his telegram of the 7th August [Eastern Report XXIX, p. 3] in regard to Roumanians coming to England. Some of those who had already gone to Russia had returned with the most discouraging reports as to the difficulties of living in that country ; the Government was experiencing great difficulty in evacuating such people as deputies and senators, so uninviting was the prospect of a sojourn in Russia. It was very desirable on political grounds that escape from the Germans should be afforded to as many Roumanians of the better class as possible.Relations with Russia. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan on the 7th September [No. 1893] in regard to a telegram from M. Bratiano, which had been communicated by the Roumanian Minister, requesting him to inform the Russian Government and inquire as to their views. M. Bratiano had urged that to avoid a disaster the Russian Government must place the resources of Bessarabia at the disposal of both armies, which the Russian Minister of Agriculture was opposing. He also urged that the Russian Government should requisition cars for transport purposes; at present what was provided not only did not meet what had been stipulated for in the Russo-Roumanian convention but was even insufficient for the supply of the Russian troops. As to the army, the situation on the front was so serious that a catastrophe was imminent and could only be prevented by all necessary authority being given to the Russian commanders.Financial Need. Sir G. Barclay telegraphed from Jassy on the 6th September [No. 532] saying that the Prime Minister had again spoken of the extremely pressing need of financial assistance, saying that the position of Ptoumania was one of real &apos;&quot;&apos; anguish &quot; and that she was living from day to day whether the Government left Moldavia or not her need was equally urgent.TURKEY.The proposed Conference on Prisoners of War.  Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed on the 7th September [No. 794] that he had been informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the latter had received, a few days previously, a telegram from Constan-tinople regarding the proposed conference. The telegram being, according to the Turkish Minister, undecypherable or unintelligible, he had asked for it to be repeated. The Minister for Foreign Affairs did not believe this story, and had asked the Turkish Minister to enquire of his Government whether they agreed to the conference.
Telegraphing again on the 10th September [N6; 809], Sir H. Rumbold said, that it looked as if the Turks meant to accept the conference, &quot;as an agent had learnt that the Turkish representatives were reported to be: Tewfik JJadi Bey, chief of the political section of the Ministry of Police, and Tewfik Bey of the Turkish Foreign Office.   Sir JET. Rumbold, however, had had no confirmation of the report.Jemal Pasha. Sir PL Rumbold telegraphed on the 10th September [No. 808] that the reasons for JemaFs recall were his having urged the necessity of adequate defence against our attack on Syria, and his refusal to agree to the German plan of a systematic attack on Bagdad. Sir H. Rumbold had learnt on good authority that though Jemal had been superseded by Rushfi in the command of the fourth army he remained Minister of Marine.ABYSSINIA.Defeat of Lij Yasu. Mr- Thesiger telegraphed on the 28th August [No. 54] that on the previous day Lij Yasu&apos;s army had been utterly defeated by the Minister of War.   Nothing was known in regard to the fate of Lij Yasu.SYRIA AND PALESTINE.Meeting of Arab Leaders. An agent reports, on what appears to be good authority, that a secret meeting of leading Arabs from the chief towns of Syria and Palestine was held at Beirut on the 2nd August. The object aimed at was the complete detachment of Arabia and Palestine from the Turkish yoke. The instigators were two rich Arabs who reached Beirut from America in July. Those present hoped for the support of France and England ; and they addressed a manifesto to the &apos;: King of Arabia and Hejaz.&quot; A commissioner has been sent to Syria by the Turks to enquire into the movement and to pass sentence of death on those present at the meeting.ARABIA.Hejaz.Grant from French Government [Eastern Report XXXII, p. 5]. Mr. Balfour telegraphed on the 6th September to Sir R. Wingate [No.- 874] that the French Government was being informed that on application the export of the gold would be permitted ; at the same time the hope was expressed that either the King or Faisal would be the recipient of the money.Asir.Idrisi. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir R. Wingate on the 7th September [No. 877] asking for his observations on the opinion expressed by the War Office on his telegram of the 23rd August [Eastern Report XXXI, p. 5], and more especially in regard to the guns furnished to Idrisi, which the War Office understood had not been taken into use. It felt, too, that the defection of the Hashid Bakil tribes might be due not to any real intention of attacking the Turks in Yemen, but to the non-receipt by the Imam of his Turkish subsidy. It was further impressed by the considerations urged to suggest that Idrisi was hoping to consolidate his position as against the Imam. It was of opinion that, till Idrisi or the chiefs of the confederacy saw some practical proof of co-operation by the British forces at Aden, there could be no expectation of any successful movement, and therefore it would be useless to afford Idrisi any financial co-operation before such operations from Aden could be undertaken.On the 9th September the Resident at Aden telegraphed [? 449 A.P.] to Cairo saying that Idrisi had freely used the guns which had been given to him ; this informa-tion came through the &quot; Minto.&quot; It was true that there was evidence that they had been used by ill-trained men ; he had promised to send more men to be trained, after the first lot had passed through our hands, but they had not come. Idrisi no doubt wished to consolidate his position, both against the Turks and against the Imam, and felt that this could be done by subsidising the Hashid Bakil, whose defection was, in the Residents opinion, due in part to the inaction of the Imam, but mainly to the non-payment of the subsidy. If Idrisi were given financial assistance, no doubt he would use it for his own ends ; but those ends would only be indirectly against the Imam ; unless, of course, the latter should act first against him, his first endeavour would be against the Turks.   His operations could not be controlled, but in spite of that his
employment of the tribes would assist us materially. In July 1916 he was given a definite promise that, if he completed such an agreement with the tribes as he was now prepared to do, he would be helped financially; failure to support him now would not only bring about the disbandment of the tribes, but would also estrange him.On the 11th September Sir R. Wingate telegraphed [No. 952] saying that, though the War Office apprehensions certainly had foundation, but since a policy of complete inaction must discourage Idrisi without procuring any. corresponding benefit to our relations with the Imam, he still maintained the line of action recommended in his telegram No. 390 [? 890, as to which see Eastern Report XXXT, p. 5]. He agreed with the Residenfs views, and more especially as to the desirability of military operations from Aden. Our failure to support Idrisi at the present juncture could be justified if military operations from Aden (to include the reoccupation of Lahej) were contemplated this autumn. Should such operations, however, not be contemplated, he thought that we should be well advised to give him at once the supplies and money necessary for him to stimulate the movement against the Turks in Yemen and consolidate his own position.The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 11th September [No. 452 A.P.] saying that Said Mustapha had informed him that the guns given to Iclrisi had been used by him on the Beni Abs front, some against the Turks.at Ha. Mustapha had just received a letter in which Idrisi referred to his treatment before and after Eoniida, and deplored the delay in sending him assistance, which delay he said enabled the Turks to take action. He said that Shaykh Hassan of Taiz was ready to rise against the Turks, and of this statement they had confirmation in Aden. Idrisi also reported that under his auspices Rigal had began operations against Eb ....Yemen.llie Imam. The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 7th September [No. 4,46 A.P.] that it was stated that, at the instigation of the, Turks, the Imam was prohibiting the Arabs going to Aden from Rada. Also that a reliable report had been received that the Imam had sent a messenger offering, as a ransom for the murder.of Abu Ras, certain territorial privilege * together with the sum of 13,000 dollars to Dhu Hussein and Dhu Mohammed, who were at the same time ordered to cease fighting under pain of being regarded as fighting against the Imam himself, who would send a force against them.Telegraphing again on the 11th September [No. 452 A.P.], the Resident said that Said Mustapha had placed in his hands two letters which from their language, hand-writing, and seal appeared to be certainly authentic, one from Ahmed Ibn Ahmed, Shaykh of the Chaizelan section of the Dhu Mohammed, addressed to the Imam, the other the latter&apos;s reply thereto. Ahmed Ibn Ahmed wrote asking the Imam to pay his people&apos;s stipends. He said that he had been trying to keep them from joining the infidel, i,e., ourselves; and the Imam had replied that whoever was a friend of the infidels was one of them, anyone who fought for them was worse. A.s for an allowance, he declined to pay any.PERSIA.The Supposed Political Assassinations [Eastern Report XXIII, p. 5]. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 11th September [No. 303] saying that the political atmosphere had been somewhat cleared by the investigations held by the Chief of Police (a Swede) which had shown that the motive for the series of murders was not a political one. To give a political colour to the crime advantage had been taken of the fact that the first victim was in close relations with the British Legation ; the next two victims were selected to strengthen this impression, whilst the chief motive of the fourth crime was the removal of the occupant of a coveted post.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.RUSSIA.The Internal Situation. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 10th September [No. 1416] that the Government had that morning received news that General Korniloff had proclaimed himself dictator.   General Alexieff had urged a conciliatory policy, and [898-60] : C
the Government had been prepared to act on his advice, but General Korniloff had made it impossible for it to.have any further dealings with him after the way he had spoken in his manifesto, denouncing, as he did, the members of the Government as German, spies and accusing them of. having brought on the crisis by sendinp; Lvov to head-quarters as an agent provocateur. General Korniloffs advance on Petrograd would be resisted, and M. Tereschenko feared that the cutting off of supplies would provoke a Bolshevist rising, which would probably end in a commune. M. Tereschenko advised, the diplomatic corps to leave Petrograd at once for Moscow or Finland. Sir G. Buchanan said that he would call a meeting of the heads of missions and lay the proposal before them; but so far as he himself was concerned he could not run away and Lave the British colony without protection. Sir G. Buchanan further said that personal feeling, must be put.on one side, and though he quite understood their, indignation at being called German agents, he thought an understanding might be arrived at if it was explained that Lvov had acted independently of the Government. M. Tereschenko, however, held out no hope of any such understanding being reached.On the following day Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed again saying that M. Tereschenko had informed him that the commanders-in-chief of the Caucasus and the western fronts and of the Baltic and Black Sea fleets, together with various military districts, had declared for the Government. The generals commanding the northern and Roumanian fronts had expressed their readiness to submit to the Government and to continue in their posts though they disapproved of a change in the commandership-in-chief. General Denikine, who commanded the south-west front, had been arrested, as lie had declared for General Korniloff, but his troops supported the Governments Three cavalry divisions were,he said, the only troops on which General Korniloff could rely, and of these the Cossack division of the Don had sent to ask the Government for directions. M. Tereschenko admitted that General Korniloff might gain possession of Petrograd ; but this -would not ensure his final victory, for the rest of Russia was with the Govern-ment. &quot;His greatest fear was that civil war would ensue. All Ministers had resigned, though they continued to act as heads of their&quot;&quot;departments ; M. Kerensky was virtually dictator, and he was being urged to assume command of the army.Sir G. Buchanan expressed the opinion that implicit reliance could not be placed on the promises of submission to the Government noted above, though he raised no question -as to the correctness of the information ; any marked success by General Korniloff would affect the attitude of those who now declared for the Government, and accounts were no contradictory that it was impossible to forecast the result of the contest.-On the 12th September Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan [No. 1937] saying that His Majesty&apos;s Government felt that to restore the order and security which &quot;were essential to Russia&apos;s life, the services of both M. Kerensky and General Korniloff were essential, and it therefore ire hoped that a reconciliation might be possible. He added that if Sir G. Buchanan should think that he could do anything to bring about thisx&quot;result he had full authority to make the attempt. On the same day a telegram was sent to Lord Bertie instructing him to ask that like instructions should be sent to the French ambassador. Lord Bertie replied on the 13th September [No. 921] that M. Ribot would lay the matter before the Cabinet, though personally he regarded the issue between General Korniloff and M. Kerensky as unsuitable for ambassadorial intervention.Colonel Blair telegraphed on the 12th September, through Sir G. Buchanan Nn. 1428], saying that the delay in General Korniloffs advance had given time for the arrest of many of his supporters, for the Crunstadt gariison to arrive at Potrograd, and, for the Petro^rad garrison to be organsed.Submission of (general Korniloff:.-Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 12th September [No. 1432] that General Lukomski- had notified the readiness of General, Korniloff to hand over his command, and had asked to whom it should be transferred.General Alexieff. In the same telegram Sir G. Buchanan said that General Alexieff would eventually be appointed commander-in-chief, and had now, at M. Kerensky&apos;s request, accepted the post of chief of the general staff, with full powers over the army.Odessa. The British consul at Odessa telegraphed on the 13th September [No. 106] that the garrison of that place was composed of undisciplined infantry, the artillery was in favour of Korniloff. Practically all the officers adhered to him, but they were powerless, and some had already been arrested, whilst tlie officers of the fleet were forced by armed sailors to send a telegram declaring for Kerensky. The town, was in the hands of a revolutionary committee, adherents of Kerensky, with whom the
chief of the military district and the chief of the staff were working ; life was normal on the surface.   Only news favourable to the committee was published.The Diplomatic Corps. Sir G.. Buchanan telegraphed on the 10th September [No. 1422] that it had been decided at a meeting of the heads of missions that they should stay on in Petrograd. At a second meeting they agreed to a resolution declaring their Unanimous wish to offer their good offices with the one and only aim of serving the cause of the Allies and the interests of Russia. The resolution was presented by-Sir G. Buchanan to M. Tereschenko, who subsequently informed him that he should state in the Press that all assistance in their power was being rendered by the repre-sentatives of the Allies, but that he should not&apos;publish the text of the resolution. Two days later Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed again [No. 1434] that at his request M. Tereschenko had agreed to publish the resolution, which had been completely misunderstood by the Soviet organ.POLAND.The Regency Question.S\r E. Howard, on the 13th September, transmitted [No. 27311 a telegram which he had received from Sir G. Buchanan, saying that he had been informed that the Council of Polish Parties could not at all approve the idea of the proposed regency. His informant was Count Wielopolski, who said that tins Council really represented the views of Russian Poles ; it hid been formed as the result of the Polish Conference at Moscow. In the opinion of the Council the idea of an Austrian or German 1&apos;rince as Regent was not acceptable to any Polish party, and it believed that a regency created by the Central Powers would be incapable of following a neutral policy, much less one hostile to the Central Powers.ROUMANIA.Relations with Russia.- Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 10th September fNo. 14151 in reply to the Foreign Office telegram of the 7th September [supra, p.&apos;3] saying that M. Tereschenko was of opinion., that M. Bratiano was inclined to exaggeration. There had not been sufficient time to discuss the question properly, but M. Tereschenko said that whilst it would be impossible to ear-mark the resources of Bessarabia for the exclusive use of either country, the Commander-in-Ohief had full authority to use those resources as he thought best for the armies at the, front: die could requisition everything.Exchange of Prisoners of War with Austria [supra, p. 2]. Sir G. Buchanan, telagraphed on the 10th September [No. 1418] that he had been informed by M. Tereschenko that the allegation that there was an agreement to repatriate prisoners across the battle front was devoid of truth.l&apos;RlNTi D A.T Tail  KORE1GK OFFICE 0   tt-  HAIiKlSON. 10/9/1917.

SECRET.71Arab Bureau, Savoy Hotel,.Cairo, August 20, 1917.No. 60.SUMMARY.ARABIA.-(a) The Sherif and his Neighbours.(b) Twenty-seven Articles.(c) Route Report : Yam bo to Abu Markha.NOTES.-(a) Yemen News.(A) Hejaz intelligence.K.  COHNWALLIS,Major, Director, Arab Bureau.
ARABIA.The Sherif and his Neighbours.In Bulletin No. 58 (p. 329) we referred to an interview which Colonel. Wilson had with the Sherif on the subject of the latter&apos;s relations with Ibn Sand and the Idrisi. We have now received from him a detailed account of this interview, written by-Captain Lawrence, who was present. The Sherif, after explaining the misunderstanding caused b)T Ibn Dakhil (see last Bulletin, p. 341), said that his relations with Ibn Saud for many years had been friendly, and he had no intention of giving offence in the manner suggested by Sidi Abdullah.On the contrary, be had invited Abd el-Rahman, Ibn Saud&apos;s father, to come to Mecca for the Haj, and to reconcile with Ibn Sand such fugitives of the Emir&apos;s family (is had taken refuge with him in Mecca. He hopes to hear in a few days that Abd el-Rahman is comins;.The Sherif also said that Sidi Abdullah was on the best of terms with Ibn Saud, and insisted that he went to Shaara in 1914-1915 to assist Ibn Saud against Ibn Rashid. He also said that Abdullah&apos;s presence there had prevented Ibn Rashid from following up the victor)&apos; at Jerab. This is also Sidi Abdullah&apos;s present view of his action on that occasion, and it is worth noting, from Captain Shakespear&apos;s reports before the battle (Arab Bulletin, 1916, p. 336), that Abdullah and Ibn Saud were in direct relation at that lime.Colonel Wilson suggested to the Sherif that it might be desirable to send letters officially to Idrisi and Ibn Saud, informing them that his assumption of the Royal, title was not intended in any way to suggest interference with their internal affairs, and proposing common action against the Turks. He suggested that if Said Mustafa, and Turki could come to Mecca as representatives of Idrisi and Ibn Saud, the relations of the three rulers could be put on a satisfactory basis.The Sherif said he did not agree with him. He thought it unwise to raise the question of the inter-relations of tire Emirates of Arabia, while the Turks were still in possession of the Hejaz. His future policy towards the other Emirs would be guided, when the time came, by the wishes of the British Government. For the present he intends to make no demand, suggestion, or protest to them, in any event. He did not believe they could harm him, even if they wanted to, and as for their co-operation with him against the Turks, they all had cause enough against the Turks, and treaties with the British Government, and if that did not move them, he was not going to try.Later he said that Idrisi&apos;s promise of neutrality to Muhied-din in Asir had enabled the Turks to operate against the Beni Shitlji&quot;, who had however repulsed them and inflicted a loss of twenty-five killed on them.    He said that Ibn Saud&apos;s conduct
towards Ibn Rashid was a disappointment,&quot;especially his recent retirement from Northern Qashn. He had asked Salih ibn. Athil for the reason for the latter move, and Salih had replied that he was not in a position, to explain it.He mentioned that Ibn Saud had permitted the Turkish military envoys, with specie for the Yemen force, to pass through his country, on payment of  10,000, and expressed some disgust at the meanness which would break a treaty obligation for so small a bribe. He also said that the riding family of Kovveit was negroid, ancl that Mohammerah, as Persian&apos;, was hardly in a posi-tion to enter an Arab Confederation.The Sherif mentioned later that the Ajinau who had turned on Ibn Saud ancl killed his brother were now serving Sidi Zeid and Sidi Abdullah. He had no intention of making capital out of them ; but he hoped, through Abd el-Rahman, to persuade Ibn Saud to make peace with them.When asked what his ideas were with regard to Ibn Rashid, he promptly said that Ibn Rashid was a. young fool with no will or policy of his Own. The visit of Ibn Ajil to Abdullah, the defeat of Rashaid Ibn Leila by Zeid (see p. 316), and the inter-view between Ibn Riminal and Sherif Nasir were then quoted as possible indications of an early submission of the Shammar to his authority, ancl he was asked what his attitude towards proposals of peace would be. He replied that when the time came, he would consult with Colonel Wilson and act in accordance with the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government.It was evident throughout the interview that the. Sherif has no intention at all of adjusting the relations of the Hejaz Govern-merit with the Emirs of Arabia until after the fall of Medina,. He said quite frankly that they were not.going to do him good or harm at present, and felt that his position would then be suffi-ciently improved to give him the advantage in negotiation. He insisted at the same time upon his good personal relations with the various rulers, and Seemed to anticipate no difficulty in arriv-hig eventually at an agreement with them, agreeable to the wishes of the British Government.Twenty-seven Articles.The following notes have been expressed in commandment form for greater clarity and to save words. They are, however, only my personal conclusions, arrived at gradually while I worked in the Hejaz and now put on paper as stalking horses for beginners in the Arab armies. They are meant to apply only to Beclu ; townspeople or Syrians require totally different treatment. They are of course not suitable to any other person&apos;s need, or applicable unchanged in any particular situation.    Handling Hejaz Arabs is
an art, not a science, with exceptions and no obvious rules. At (die same time we have a great chance there ; the Sherif trusts us, and lias given us the position (towards his Government) wdiich the Germans wanted to win in Turkey. If we are tactful, we can. at once retain his goodwill and carry out our job, but to succeed vye have got to put into it all the interest and skill we possess.1. Go easy just for the first few weeks. A bad start is difficult to atone for, and the Arabs form their judgments on externals that we ignore. When you have reached the inner circle in a tribe, you can do as you please with yourself and them.2. Learn all you can about your Ashraf and Bedu. Get to know their families, clans and tribes, friends and enemies, wells, hills and roads. Do all this by listening and by indirect inquiry. Do not ask questions. Get to speak their dialect of Arabic, not yours. Until you can understand their allusions, avoid getting deep into conversation, or you will drop bricks. Be a little stiff at first.3. In matters of business deal only with the commander of the army, column, or party in which you serve. Never give orders to anyone at all, and reserve your directions or advice for the CO., however great the temptation (for efficiency&apos;s sake) of dealing direct with his underlings. Your place is advisor)&apos;, and your advice is due to the commander alone. Let him see that this is your conception of your duty, and that his is to be the sole executive of your joint plans.4. Win and keep the confidence of your leader. Strengthen his prestige at your expense before others when you can. Never refuse or quash schemes he may put forward ; but ensure that they are put forward in the first instance private!)&apos; to you. Always approve them, and after praise modify them insensibly, causing the suggestions to come from him, until they are in accord with your own opinion. When you attain this point, hold him to it, keep a tight grip of his ideas, and push him forward as firmly as possibly, but secretly, so that no one but himself (and he not too clearly) is aware of your pressure.5. Remain in touch with your leader as constantly and unobtrusively as you can. Live with him, that at meal times and at audiences you may be naturally witli him in his tent. Formal visits to give advice are not so good as the constant drop-ping of ideas in casual talk. When stranger sheikhs come in for the first time to swear allegiance and offer service, clear out of the tent. If their first impression is of foreigners in the confi-dence of the Sherif, it will do the Arab cause much harm.(i. Be shy of too close relations with the subordinates of the expedition. Continual intercourse with them will make it impossible for you to avoid going behind or beyond the instruc-tions that the Arab CO., has given them on your advice, and in so disclosing the weakness of his position you altogether destroy your own.
7. Treat the sub-chiefs of. your force quite easily and lightly. In this way you hold yourself above their level. Treat the leader, if a Sherif, with respect. He will return your manner and you and he will then be alike, and above the rest. Prececl-ence is a serious matter among the Arabs, and you must attain it.8. Your ideal position is when you are present and not noticed. Do not be too intimate, too prominent, or too earnest. Avoid being identified too long or too often with any tribal sheikh, even if CO. of the expedition. To do your work you must be above jealousies, and you lose prestige if you are asso-ciated with a tribe or clan, and its inevitable feuds. Sherifs are above all blood-feuds and local rivalries, and form the only prin-ciple of unity among the Arabs. Let your name therefore be coupled always with a Sheriffs, and share his attitude towards the tribes. When the moment comes for action put yourself publicly under his orders.   The Bedu will then follow suit.9. Magnify and develop the growing conception of the Sherifs as the natural aristocracy of the Arabs. Intertribal jea-lousies make it impossible for any sheikh to attain a commanding position, and the only hope of union in nomacl Arabia is that the Ashraf be universally acknowledged as the ruling class. Sherifs are half-townsmen, half-nomad, in manner and life, and have the instinct of command. Mere merit and money would be insufficient to obtain such recognition ; but the Arab reverence for pedigree and the Prophet gives hope for the ultimate success of the Ashraf.1.0. Call your Sherif &quot;Sicli&quot; in public and in private. Call other people by their ordinary names, without title. In intimate conversation call a Sheikh &quot; Abu Annad,&quot; &quot; Akhu Alia &quot;or some similar by-name.11. The foreigner and Christian is not a popular person in Arabia. However friendly and informal the treatment of yourself may be, remember always that your foundations are very sandy ones. Wave a Sherif in front of you like a banner and hide your own mind and person. If you succeed, you will have hundreds of miles of country and thousands of men under your orders, and for this it is worth bartering the outward show.12. Cling tight to your sense of humour. You will need it every day. A dry irony is the most useful type, and repartee of a personal and not too broad character will double your influence with the chiefs. Reproof, if Wrapped up in some smiling form, will carry further and last longer than the most violent speech. The power of mimicry or parody is valuable, but use it sparingly, for wit is more dignified than humour. Do not cause a laugh at, a Sherif except amongst Sherifs.13. Never lay hands on an Arab ; you degrade yourself. You may think the resultant obvious increase of outward respect a gain to you ; but what you have really clone is to build a wall between you and their inner selves.   It is difficult to keep quiet
when everything is being done wrong, but the less you lose your temper the greater your advantage. Also then you will not go mad yourself.14. While very difficult to drive, the Bedu are easy to lead? if you have the patience to bear with them. The less apparent your interferences the more your influence. They are willing to follow your advice and do what you wash, but they do not mean you or anyone else to be aware of that. It is only after the end of all annoyances that you find at bottom their real fund of good-will.15. Do not try to do too &quot;much with your own hands. Better the Arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly. It is their war, and you are to help them, not to win it for them. Actually, also, under the very odd conditions of Arabia, your practical work will not be as good as, perhaps, you. think it is.16. &apos; If you can, without being too lavish, forestall presents to yourself. A well.placed gift is often most effective in winning over a suspicious sheikh. Never receive a present without giving a liberal return, but you may delay this return (while letting its ultimate certainty be known) if you require a particular service from the giver. Do not let them ask you for things, since their greed will theu make them look upon you only as -a cow to milk.17. Wear an Arab headcloth when with a tribe. Bedu have a, malignant prejudice against the hat, and believe that our per-sistence in wearing it (due probably to British obstinacy of dictation) is founded on some immoral or irreligious principle. A thick headcloth forms a, good protection against the sun, and if you wear a hat your best Arab friends will be ashamed of you in public.18. Disguise is not advisable. Except in special areas, let it be clearly known that you are a British officer and a Christian. At the same time, if you can wear Arab kit when with the tribes, you wdll acquire their trust and intimacy to a degree impossible in uniform. It is, however, dangerous and difficult. The)&apos; make no special allowances for you when you dress like them. Breaches of etiquette not charged against a foreigner are not condoned to you in Arab clothes. You will be like an actor in a foreign theatre, playing a, part day and night for months, without rest, and for an anxious stake. Complete success, which is when the Arabs forget your strangeness and speak naturally before you, counting you as one of themselves, is perhaps only attainable in character : Avhile half-success (all that most of us will strive for; the other costs too much) is easier to win in British things, and you yourself will last longer, physically and mentally, in the comfort that they mean. Also then the Turks will not bang you, when you are caught.19. If you wear Arab things, wear the best. Clothes are significant among the tribes, and you must wear the appropriate, and appear at ease in them. Dress like a Sherif, if &quot;they agree to it.
20. If you wear Arab things at all, go the whole way. Leave your English friends and customs on the coast, and fall back on Arab habits entirely. It is possible, starting thus level Avith them, for the European to beat the Arabs at their own game, for we have stronger motives for our action, and put more heart into it than they. If you can surpass them, you have taken an immense stride toward complete success, but the strain of living and thinking in a foreign and half-understood language, the savage food, strange clothes, and stranger ways, with the complete loss of privacy and quiet, and the impossibility of eA7er relaxing your AA7atchful imitation of the others for months on end, provide such an added stress to the ordinary difficulties of cleal-ing Avith the Bedu, the climate, and the Turks, that this road should not be chosen without serious thought.21. Religious discussions will be frequent. Say what you like about your own side, and avoid criticism of theirs, ,unless you know that the point is external, when you may score heavily by proving it so. With the Bedu, Islam is so all-pervading an element that there is little religiosity, little fervour, and no regard for externals. Do not think from their conduct that they are careless. Their conviction of the truth of their faith, and its share in every act and thought and principle of their daily life is so intimate and intense as to be unconscious, unless roused by opposition. Their religion is as much a part of nature to them as is sleep or food.22. Do not try to trade on what you know of fighting. The Hejaz confounds ordinary tacties. Learn the Bedu prin-ciples of war as thoroughly and as quickly as you can, for till you know them your advice will be no good to the Sherif. Unnum-bered generations of tribal raids have taught them more about some parts of the business than are will ever know. In familiar conditions they fight well, but strange events cause panic. Keep your unit small. Their raiding parties are usually from one hundred to two hundred men, and if yon take a crowd they only get confused. Also their sheikhs, while admirable company com-nianders, are too &quot;set&quot; to learn to handle the equivalents of bat-batalions or regiments. Don&apos;t attempt unusual things, unless the)7 appeal to the sporting instinct Bedu have so strongly, or unless success is obvious. If the objective is a good one (booty) they will attack like fiends, they are splendid scouts, their mobility gives you the advantage that will win this local war, they make proper use of their knowledge of the country (don&apos;t take tribesmen to places they do not know), and the gazelle-hunters, who form a proportion of the better men, are great shots at visible targets. A sheikh from one tribe cannot give orders to men from another ; a Sherif is necessary to command a mixed tribal force. If there is plunder in prospect, and the odcls are at all equal, you will win. Do not waste Bedu attacking trenches (they will not stand casualties) or in trying to defend a position, for they cannot sit still without slacking.   The more unorthodox
rand Arab your proceedings, the more likely you are to have the Turks cold, for they lack initiative and expect you to. Don&apos;t play for safety.23. The open reason that Bedu give you for action or inaction may be true, but always there will be better reasons left for you to divine. You must find these inner reasons (they will be denied, but are none the less in operation) before shaping your arguments for one course or other. Allusion is more effective than logical exposition.: they dislike concise expression. Their minds work just as ours do, but on different premises. There is nothing unreasonable, incomprehensible, or inscrutable in the Arab. Experience of them, and knowledge of their prejudices will enable you to foresee their attitude and possible course of action in nearly every case.24. Do not mix Bedu ancl Syrians, or trained men and tribesmen. You will get work out of neither, for they hate each other. I have never seen a successful combined operation, but many failures. In particular, ex-officers of the Turkish army, however Arab in feelings and blood and language, are hopeless with Bedu. They are narrow-minded in tactics, unable to adjust themselves to irregular warfare, clumsy in Arab etiquette, swollen-headed to the extent of being incapable of politeness to a tribesman for more, than a few minutes, impatient, ancl, usually, helpless without their troops on the road and in action. Your orders (if you were unwise enough to give any) would be more readily obeyed by Bed tuns than those of any Mohammedan Syrian officer. Arab townsmen and Arab tribesmen regard each other mutuallv as poor relations, and poor relations are much more objectionable than poor strangers.25. In spite of ordinary Arab example, avoid too free talk about women. It is as difficult a subject as religion, and their standards are so unlike our own that a remark, harmless in English, may appear as unrestrained to them, as some of their statements would look to us, if translated literally.26. Be as careful of your servants as of yourself. If you want a sophisticated one you will probably have to take an Egyptian, or a Sudani, and unless you are very lucky he will undo on trek much of the good you so laboriously effect. Arabs will cook rice and make coffee for you, and leave you if required to do unmanly work like cleaning boots or washing. They are only really possible if you are in Arab kit. A slave brought up in the Hejaz is the best servant, but there are rules against British subjects owning them, so they have to be lent to you. In any case, take with you an Ageyli or two when you go up country. They are the most efficient couriers in Arabia, and understand camels.27. The beginning and ending of the secret of handling Arabs is unremitting study of them. Keep always on your guard ; never say an unnecessary thing : watch yourself and your companions all the time : hear all that passes, search out what is
going on beneath the surface, read their characters, discover their tastes and their weaknesses, and keep everything you find out to yourself. Bury yourself in Arab circles, have no interests and no ideas except the work in hand, so that your brain is saturated with one thing only, and you realise your part deeply enough to avoid the little slips that would counteract the painful work of weeks. Your success will be proportioned to the amount of menial effort you devote to it.T.E.L.Route Report: Yambo to Abu Markha.The following route report has been received from Bimbashi Garland :-The first eighteen miles lies along the sandy plain stretching before Jebel Ruclhwa ; there is no water and very little cover. Passing between the low hills, the road becomes heavy with sand, and after about, three miles Bir Agida is reached, where there is one well about fifty feet deep, with plenty of water.The surface improves, the hills become higher, reaching to 700-1,000 feet, and the Wadi broadens out until, after about, six miles; Nakhl Mubarak is reached, in the Wadi Yambo.The water at Nakhl Mubarak is clear and good and may be drunk without boiling. The oasis is similar to the other sixteen that are passed in close succession, these only differing in size ; Stteg and Bethna being probably the two largest. The growth of palms is luxuriant and could be much more so with proper attention, which does not seem to be given at present. There are markets at most of the springs, and sugar, sheep, dates, etc. may be bought at high prices.The following is the order in which the springs are passed : Nakhl Mubarak ; Jeria ; Muzra ; Ain el-Nur ; Agamia ; Am Sulman ; Skobya ; Jebrya ; Ajlan ; Shaatha ; Ain Ali ; Suega ; Sueg (about two miles long) ; Asirn ; Bethna (about one and a half miles long) ; Kheif Hussein.From Kheif Hussein the journey round Jebel Rudhwa begins and the road is much less hospitable. The surface is clogged with loose sand for long stretches. At the foot of Rudhwa there is water in several places, but it is generally one to two hours from the road.Twelve miles from Kheif Hussein the road reaches Ft he. where the water is somewhat nearer, being about hall&apos; an hour&apos;s ride away, and is situated in a small wadi running from the west.
At Kheif Hussein the road leaves Wadi Ynmbo, and Wadi Kuba is entered and traversed for about ten miles. Then the road lies between and over very stony foothills for about fourteen miles, until Wadi Ruku is reached. This wadi joins up with Wadi Kuba north-east of Ruclhwa. Proceeding some four miles along this wadi, El-Dom is reached. This place is only to be distinguished by the one palm standing in the wadi, and El-Dom is sometimes used as an alternative name for Wadi Rubu. There is water (not plentiful) about one hours ride up the gorge on the western slope of the wadi at EI-Dom.Wadi Ruku or Wadi. Dora is followed for about three more miles, the last one of which is rather sandy ; and continuing almost the same direction, the road lies over easy foothills lying around Jebel Ruku close by on the west until the source of Wadi Run is entered.Five miles from El-Dom is Bair, on the western side, where there is water about two hours&apos; journey from the wadi.The road continues along Wadi Run, which has a fairly good surface all the way, until Wadi Ais is entered, whence, after turning north-east, Abu Markha is reached after half an hours&apos; travel.An alternative road lies via Nijl, and caravans usually call there. Wadi Run is left about two miles from Wadi Ais and a north-easterly direction taken between low-lying hills, jSTijl being-reached after about four miles. Here is a palm grove about half a mile long, but the water is poor. There is no spring, but water is obtained in plenty a few inches from the surface. There are about half a dozen stone-built houses and a few palm-leaf huts.The road to Abu Markha follows the Wadi Ais and is about live miles long. About half-way there is a large old Turkish fort in ruins posted on the top of a hill in the middle of the wadi.Stages.

NOTE.Yemen News:The Sheikh of. the Yu-sufyin (see p. 202) lias written to the Abdali Sultan, forwarding a letter from Naqib Hassan bin qassim&apos;s Abu Ras, brother of the Abu Ras who was killed by the Turks. This letter contains a request for assistance in men and ammu-nition, and states that fighting against the Turks has already started, that all the Rijal el-Mashriq (i.e. the Eastern tribes) have risen, and that 700 of them have already arrived and .5,0.00 more are on their way.A later report from Aden states that, about July 23, a meeting took place at Qafilet [Tdhr between the Imam and Sheikhs of Dhu Mohammed and Dhu Hussein and other Zeidi chiefs with reference to the,murder of Abu Ras. According to this report, the Imam advised the acceptance of a monetary compensation, but the Sheikhs refused, and the Sheikhs of Ibb have revolted against the Turks and the Imam. After the meeting, 4,000 men of Dhu Mohammed and Dhu Hussein joined forces with Kaid ibn Hassan, the successor of Abu Ras ; while several thousands of the Imain&apos;s men under the command of Abu Naib (chief of the Al-Ahim section of the Hashid ?) are said to be marching towards Mawia, with what object is not known.Kaid Ahmed of Hajarieh (see p. 319) recently wrote to Aden asking for arms and ammunition to assist in the movement against the Turks, and sent letters which he had received from Said Ahmed of Taiz, who anticipates success if assistance is given, and from Yehva ibn Yehya el-Shaif, chief of the Shaif section of the Bekil (p. 197).Kamaran reports that the general effect of the bombardment of Hodeida is good. The British Indians, however, have suffered, and are now reported to be treated as prisoners, being kept under guard about two miles out of Hodeida during the day and in the military barracks at night.Since the above was written, a telegram received from Aden shows that 1,000 men of the Hashid and Bekil, with some of their principal chiefs, have gone to Jeizan to meet the Idrisi, and are ready for service against the Turks if large subsidies are provided.The idrisi declares that the assistance of the British Govern-ment is necessary, and it is clear that money&apos; and food must be sent if the tribesmen are to be kept together.Sultan Salih ibn Omar of the Dhubi section of the Upper Yafa confederation (Aden Interior) has visited the Imam and concluded some agreement with him ; but he is, nevertheless, willing to join the Confederacy, and writes to Aden asking for a grant of&apos;  400. In his hitter he refers to the enmity between the Imam and the Idrisi, and states that TSFasir Mabkhut (p. 256) and Ibn Sarhan of the Hashid are friendlv to the Idrisi.    On returning from his
Hejaz intelligence.Sherif Feisal and Gaafar Pasha returned to Wejh on August 8. Sherif Abdullah, who has under him about 2,000 Arabs, remains at Abu Mark ha. ancl his forces have continued during the month to attack the railway, which has been badly damaged to the north and south of Jedha. His operations have been somewhat hampered by lack of forage.Rails have been destroyed between Metalli and Abu take, between Tebuk and Mahtab, and in the neighbourhood of Hedie. In these cases the line is reported to have been repaired, the Arabs retiring when attacked.News reached Akaba on August 16 that the Turks had advanced to Ain Delagha, five miles west of Aba el-Lissan, in unknown strength ; and that Ain Gharandel, fifteen miles further to the west, was held by Howeitat under Ibn Jad (see p. 308). Next day, however, Akaba reported that the troops in Wadi. Delagha had been attacked by the Arabs and forced back to Weheid (Wegeidah ?) with loss of rifles and animals. There were no Arab casualties. It was reported on August 19 that Turkish cavalry, guns and machine guns had left Fuweilah for Maan.It is reported that the Kaimmakain of Maan has been sent as a prisoner to Damascus.The. Turkish troops in Maan and the vicinity7 are estimated at something over 5,000. There are believed to be approxi-mately 600 men at Tebuk, 650 at El-Ula, ancl 1,400 at Madain Saleh.On August 18 Gaafar Pasha, with about 800 trained troops, two mountain guns and four machine guns left Wejh for Akaba.visit to the Imam he met Seyyid Mohammed ibn el-Hadi and his sou, Yahya, the new claimant to the Imamate, and apparently agreed to join forces with them. He adds that they have arranged to hold a representative meeting at Itadaa (north of Yafa) about August 18, to decide on the action to be taken.
prophet, but was objectionable politically, on account of the word &quot; Emir.&quot; It was no use being Emir, without the power or pre-tence of giving orders, not to a sect, or a country or two, but to the Moslem world. The main divisions of Shia and Sunni would unite under this title, but the smaller sects, and especially the alien congregations in India and Africa, would resent the impli-cation of authority, as, no doubt, would the Great Powers.His policy for Islam was to provide in Mecca and Medina for the honourable upkeep of the Holy Places, to facilitate the pilgrimage, and to issue Fetwas and Sheria decisions as required. The Moslem world must have a head, but it would be a less tem-pestuous body of thought if the head was the Sherif and Emir of Mecca, basing his right on the concrete possession of the Holy Places, and on an authentic descent, not on a supposed implicit apostolic authority, inherited from an unbroken succession of Khalifas. His motives in rebelling against the Turks were two. The first is a political object ; the liberation of the Arab world from Turkish domination ; this he will effect without question of creed ; Christian, Druse, Shia and Sunni meet on a common base of nationality, and must co-operate with him on level terms if the aim is to be achieved. His second motive was a religious one, purely Islamic in character ; it is to provide for the Mohammedan world an independant sovereign, ruling in the Holy Places, of the Sherihan family, whose claims to the spiritual leadership of Islam will be so transcendent as to be generally admitted, but whose weakness in material resources (money, ships, and guns) will at once make him acceptable to the Christian Powers, and purge Islam of the lunatic idea that it is a polity, bound tempo-rally to a single infallible head. His ideal is a spiritual city, not a theocracy. To attain this aim he must have temporalities enough, free of foreign control, to establish his claim to political competence, and must be delivered from the hierarchical theories which have plunged Turkey, the Senussi and Ali Dinar into suicidal jehads. His temporalities he will hold as King of the Arab countries, and his spiritualities as Emir of Mecca.My personal opinion is that the title of Emir el-Muniinin would not be repugnant to him, if it came not as his assumption but as the homage of his followers. It is general!)&apos; used by the tribes to day from Kaf to Kunfida, and will apparently be accept-ab!e to the Sheikhs of urban Syria. His present objection, that it involves the power of command in Islam, does not hold good, since it is as fair to interpret it only in a doctrinal sense.As for the Khali fate, the sincere disgust he expressed of Abdul HamicVs bogus claims, and bis only half-veiled acknowlegement-ment of Shia tenets himself, made me certain that this opposition to the Idea is a matter of principle. Further, I do not think that all the temptations of the world would persuade Sherif Hussein to run counter to his principles. His transparent honesty and strength of conviction (wdiile they may prevent him distin-guishing between his prejudices and his principles) will at all
