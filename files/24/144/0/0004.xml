SECRET. onAPPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT, No. XXIX.Russia.This week&apos;s news is not very good reading. The members of the Russian Government do hot show a real readiness to face their difficulties and deal with realities. The talk about gradually restoring discipline as if it were possible to compromise on the subject recalls the attitude of &quot;the Martinet&quot; in the &quot;Bab Ballads. &quot;*They do not seem to understand that it is impossible to countenance a mild indiscipline, and that there is no half-way house between obedience and rebellion. Next week should show whether the hopes of General KornilofTs capacity to re-establish authority are well founded. M. Kerensky&apos;s changes of attitude in regard to the Stockholm Conference seem to show that he is influenced by the cries of demagogues and the whims of assemblies.Roumania.There are indications that the Germans are endeavouring to prepare the way for a re-establishment of the Roumanian State under their own auspices.Turkey.The suggestion that the ex-Khedive may presently be appointed Governor-General of Syria, if founded on fact, would be a very astute move on the part of the Turks. The Khedive, backed by money and his affable manners, might prove a very trouble-some factor in the situation.&apos; lit a cottiitry&apos; reduced to&quot; Such misery as Syria now is it is not difficult for a new man with pounds behind him to gain popularity.Arabia.The rapprochement between Idris and the King is satisfactory.Poland.The Vatican letter, which has in it so much which is unpalatable and platitudinous, strays in one sentence into a field that must be unsatisfactory to our enemies, viz., the follow-quote. The mention of the ancient Kingdom of Poland is important, and it is to the Entente interest that the greatest stress should be laid on the word ancient, for in the ancient kingdom access was allowed to the Baltic at Danzig.A map is appended with this report to show the relation of ancient Poland to the present Eastern situation.* &quot; E&apos;en he who smote his officer for punishment was booked, And mutinies upon the seas he rarely overlooked ! &quot;[898-56]
A sovereign Polish kingdom or State, with&apos;an outlet on the Baltic, would deprive Prussia of much of its power.It must not be forgotten that, even if there were a revolution in Germany, so strong an organisation as the Prussian Military Bureaucracy might reassert itself at a moment when the league of nations was not entirely at one, say, on the question of Japanese colonisation of North-West Australia. In which event an independent Polish State, with a seaport on the Baltic, might be of immense service. It is to be noted that the Baltic outlet is the only possible guarantee of Polish independence, for no nation is independent unless it has a means of direct communication with the rest of the world.

On the 8th August Lord Robert Cecil reported to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as follows : I saw this evening a Mr. Metcalfe, who has just returned from Russia. This gentleman, who is, I understand, managing director of a large British firm of boiler-makers, has been travelling all over Russia since the beginning of the war, and has come into contact with most of its leading men, more especially M. Miliukoff and the chiefs of the Cadet Party.As regards the internal condition of Russia, Mr. Metcalfe told me little that we did not already know. He painted it in the blackest of lights and considered that it must become worse before it could improve, as a collision between the forces of order and disorder was inevitable. He said that during the last two or three months there had been a strong reaction and a consolidation of all the moderate elements in the country to withstand the anarchical forces let loose. At the head of this organisation were M. Miliukoff and the Cadets; they now had a very large party -fund and were systematically preparing for the forthcoming elections to the Constituent Assembly next month. They were supported not only by the upper classes and bourgeoisie, but by a strong element among the peasants. The chief point of interest which Mr. Metcalfe emphasised was that, in a conversation with M. Miliukoff just before he left, the Cadet leader had expressed himself extremely strongly against participation by the Allies in the Stockholm Socialist Conference and had asked Mr. Metcalfe to use any influence he could in England to prevent British Socialists from attending it. M. Miliukoff declared that British and French abstention would be in the true interests of the Russian Government as against the Soviet, which latter body was steadily losing ground, and would soon, he hoped, possess but little authority.A further point on which Mr. Metcalfe laid stress was the necessity for a more [898-56] B
widespread and active British propaganda throughout Russia. He said that it woulds^ be impossible to exaggerate the activity shown by the Germans in this respect. Heto instanced a case in which he and a Russian friend had been walking through large crowds in the streets of Petrograd, and a small boy of 7 had come running through shouting at the top of his voice &quot; Stop the war ! &quot; The boy attracted general attention, but being so small no one thought of stopping him. Mr. Metcalfe&apos;s friend caught him and asked him why he was shouting these catchwords. The child declared that a man at the end of the street had given him 10 roubles to do this for an hour. Another instance Mr. Metcalfe cited was that the servant girls in Petrograd households had been systematically bribed to use all their influence with the soldiers to make them dissatisfied with the objects of the war and to prevent them from fighting.I arranged for Mr. Metcalfe to have an interview later in the afternoon with Colonel Buchan, to whom he could expand his ideas with regard to the best methods for British counter-propaganda.The Stockholm Conference. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 11th August [No. 1237] that MM. Kerensky and Tereschenko said that as they could not prevent Russian Socialists going to Stockholm, they would like those of the other allied countries to go there too, though they would much prefer that there should be no conference. In reply to the French Ambassador, who spoke of the danger which he foresaw might arise from going to Stockholm, M. Kerensky said that the Allies should send Socialists to make a stand against the&apos; Germans, and that he foresaw more danger in abstention than in participation. He also said that a refusal of permission for our Socialists to be present would tend to turn public opinion in favour of Germany, and so would add to the difficulties of the Government.The Army. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 11th August [No. 1236] an account of a conversation he had had with M. Kerensky, whom he had met at M. Tereschenko&apos;s house. He had received a message from General KornilofF asking for more guns, and he had asked M. Tereschenko, who acted as interpreter, to repeat this to M. Kerensky, adding that he was sure that he would understand how such a request would be regarded by our War Office, which would probably refuse to send more guns till it had been assured that General Korniloff would be given all the powers he considered necessary for the restoration of discipline, and that he should not be suddenly dismissed under pressure from the Sovyet. Sir G. Buchanan also said that if he could inform his Government that Petrograd had been included in the front zone and placed under martial law, and that the railways were to be militarized, he should feel more justified in reassuring it. He personally believed that there would be more street fighting and more bloodshed before the Government was really the master of the situation, as the anarchist forces had not been stamped out in spite of the measures taken by the Government. M. Kerensky replied that the Government must move progressively, and the two measures which had been indicated could not be taken at a day&apos;s notice; he also said that the Government was determined to maintain order at any cost.Sir G. Buchanan added, on the authority of General Barter, that unless he were given all the powers he considered necessary General Kornil off would refuse to remain Commander-in-chief. If he went, Sir G. Buchanan said, it would mean that the situation was hopeless, if he stayed on we might confidently look forward to a thorough reform of the army. He therefore urged the sending of sympathetic messages with a promise of guns, the shipping of which should be delayed for the present; the question of the army must be decided one way-or the other within the next month.General Korniloff.-- Sir G. Buchanan, on the 10th August, telegraphed [No. 1232] saying that M. Terestehenko had told him that General Korniloff was re-establishing discipline with an iron hand. A hundred soldiers, guilty of robbery and murder, had been shot, and their bodies placed by the side of the road with placards explaining the reason for this treatment ; some German officers, too, who had voluntarily surrendered and on whom peace propaganda documents were found, had been shot and the fact notified to the German press. The general had ordered that troops, before going to the front, should undergo a course of training for some months at some place where martial law was in force : and he would demand that Petrograd should be included in the martial law zone at the first favourable opportunity.
334, ROUMANIA.Evacuation. Sir G. Barclay, on the 7th August, transmitted [No. 436] a telegram to the Prime Minister from M. Take Jonescu, who said that in view of the limited means of transport evacuation into Russia must be begun before the danger became imminent. Many were asking to be allowed to send their wives and children to the west, and, if possible, to go themselves. He begged that means of crossing the North Sea might be accorded them at their own risk and peril; as only those who had considerable means could avail themselves of such permission, if accorded, he did not think that the number would exceed 2,000. Families going to Russia would be exposed to the uncertainty of the political situation, and would have to face the enormous cost of living there.Sir G. Barclay telegraphed again two days later [No. 443] that he and his French and Italian colleagues intended to evacuate their families and staffs with the rest of the Government and the diplomatic body, but they themselves would remain on Roumanian soil till the last moment with the King and the Prime Minister. His colleagues had telegraphed in this sense to their Governments, and had asked for instructions. In reply, Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 280] his concurrence in this proposal.Attitude of the Russian Government. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 10th-August [No. 1232] that M. Tereschenko had informed him that, in the event of evacuation, Russia would place a military zone at the disposal of the Roumanian Government in which the extra-territoriality of that Government and the King&apos;a full sovereignty would be recognised.It appears from a telegram sent by Mr. Grahame (Paris) on the 14th August [No. 797j that, though the Russian Provisional Government had promised extra-territoriality it insisted on the Roumanian Government going to Cherson and the&apos; royal family to Moscow. There was insufficient accommodation at Cherson [group undecypherable] was notoriously unhealthy and inhabited by Jews ; and the Russian press represented the Roumanians as persecutors of the. Jewish race. The Roumanian President of the Council asked that the residence of his Government might be Poltava.? A Separate Peace. Sir W. Townley telegraphed from The Hague on the 14th August [No. 2493] that he had become acquainted with the fact that a statement to the effect that negotiations were being carried on in Berlin for a separate peace with Roumania had been made to the Turkish Minister by the German Legation. The Austrian Minister at any rate affected to disbelieve the story, whether he did so or not.TURKEY.Treatment and Exchange of Prisoners of War. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir H. Rumbold on the 11th August [No. 774] saying that the Cabinet was willing (under the same conditions as governed the recent prisoners&apos; conference at The Hague) to send delegates to Switzerland to discuss with Turkish delegates questions relating to the inspection of internment camps, the treatment of civilian prisoners (including Ayoub Sabri) and combatants, and their exchange. He was instructed to make this proposal known to the Turkish Government, and to ascertain whether the Swiss Government would facilitate matters. The English delegates would be Lord Newton and General Belfield; and, should the Turks accept the proposal, it was essential that their delegates should be persons of influence and real authority.Sir H. Rumbold replied on the 13th August [No. 672] that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would ask the Turkish Minister to telegraph the proposal immediately, and would himself be glad to preside at such a conference.The Jews and the G.U.P. An agent reports that the following information was given by a well-informed Jew who left Constantinople early last month. This Jew was of opinion that the relations between the Jews and the C. U.P. had not been affected by the deportations in Palestine, as the former believed that they did not result from the deliberate policy of the Government, but were due to the excessive zeal of Jemal Pasha, though it is realised that they would have continued if there had been no interference from Berlin. The Turks have promised not to persecute the Jews in Palestine any further, and it had been agreed that it is best to say nothing more about the deportations.
Discontent in Constantinople. The same informant stated that, except among-those who were making money, there was discontent among all classes of the civil population, the least discontented being Moslems with Young Turk ideas.EGYPT.The Ex-Khedive [Eastern Report XXVII, p. 3], Sir EE. Rumbold telegraphed on the 7th August [No. 648] that Prince Abd-el-Moneim had confirmed the report that it was proposed by the Turks to make use of the Ex-Khedive&apos;s influence over the Arabs; the prince was convinced that the latter, in consequence of the financial inducement which had been held out, would leave for Turkey next month.ABYSSINIA.Negotiations with Ras Taffari. An amended copy of Mr. Thesiger&apos;s telegram of the 4th August [Eastern Report XXVIII, p. 7] shows that the third term of Ras Taffari&apos;s proposals should read as follows : If Abyssinia should have a dispute with (? another) Government, the three Powers shall agree to act as mediators.ARABIA.Hbjaz.The Pilgrimage.Siv R. Wingate telegraphed on the 13th August [No. 848] requesting that the political importance of preventing a shortage of food at Jeddah during the period of the pilgrimage might be pointed out to the Admiralty. The stocks of foodstuffs are much reduced, despatch from India to Jeddah having been prevented by the shipping difficulty; and if fresh supplies should not be received before the beginning of the pilgrim season, next month, King Hussein feared that there would be an actual shortage. The Government of India had pointed out that the control of shipping was a matter for His Majesty&apos;s Government; it had, however, undertaken to assist.Finance. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 9th August [No. 838], with reference to the Government of India&apos;s telegram of the 31st July, saying that the total amount that would be required in drafts on India, or rupee notes, to finance the Indian trade to Arabia was estimated at about 35,0O0L a month. Merchants in Jeddah contemplated suspending Indian grain importations in default of means of payment. It was of the utmost importance from the imperial point of view that the existing stock of gold should be kept in the country for political purposes, and that the country should not be cut off from supplies from India. In view of this and the small amount involved, he trusted that the Government of India would see its way to allowing trade to be financed as proposed. The matter was very urgent, as the tension at Jeddah was increasing. A possible alternative to financing by direct drafts would be to send British currency notes or drafts on London in cover to India. But this would, it is alleged, involve a loss of about 7 per cent, to merchants, and would therefore not be accepted willingly.Asm.Idrisi. The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 10th August [424 A.P.] that Said Mustaffa had joined Idrisi, and that he had received a letter from the latter, dated the 3rd August, in which he said that he was willing that, for the purpose of establishing friendly relations between him and King Hussein, Said Mustaffa should go to Mecca. He referred in his letter to the ill effects of the withdrawal from Kunfida and its subsequent occupation by the Turks. He also reported that demands for large monthly subsidies were being made by a number of the principal shaykhs of the Hashid Bakil, who had come to him; British assistance would be necessary though he was reducing the demands. He suggested that, for the purpose of discussing the details of a settlement, a British officer should be sent to Jaizan immediately. A telegram from Said Mustaffa reported that there were already 1,000 of the Hashid Bakil ready for service in Jaizan and more were arriving daily; immediate assistance in food and money was necessary to meet the requirements and prevent the men dispersing. The food might be obtained in Bombay but it was not obtainable in Aden. In the same telegram the Resident mentioned that he had received a letter from the Sultan of the Upper Yafa Duba section, who, referring to the enmity between the Imam and Idrisi, stated that the Akills of Hashid Nasir Mabkhut and Ibn Sarhan were friendly to the latter.
[893-58]CYemen.Turkey and the Imam.-Information has been received from a trustworthy source that a Turkish mission was sent some months ago to the Imam, to whom it took a large number of presents, and among them a sword mounted in brilliants. The mission has now returned, and it appears that the Imam has promised to attack King Hussein&apos;s forces and to support a Turkish offensive.The Imam&apos;s Proposals. Mr. Montagu telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 4th August with reference to his telegram of the 23rd July [Eastern Report XXVI, p. 6], saying that the Resident at Aden should reply in the terms suggested by the Viceroy to the overtures of the Imam.Sultan Saleh Ibn- Umar Ilarbara. The Resident at Aden telegraphed on the 10th August that the Sultan of the Upper Yafa Duba section, Saleh Ibn Umar Harbara (from whom a letter had been received), had concluded some agreement with the Imam, whom he had visited. Returning, he had met the head of the confederacy, Said Mohammed Ibn Al Hadi, and his son Yehia, and having agreed to besiege the enemy, they decided that, for the purpose of settling the action to be taken, they would hold a representative meeting about the 18th August. The Sultan had asked that, before he went to this meeting, he should have a money grant of 400Z.The Shammar.The Emir Feisal. The Arab Bureau telegraphed on the 9th August to D.M. I. [A.B. 194] the arrival at Mecca of &quot; Feisas El Garbah&quot; with thirty-five attendants. King Hussein said that this important Shammar chief was ready to help him, and that he would be influential in winning Ibn Rashid to our side. The Bureau telegraphed again on the 11th August [A.B. 218] that the Emir &quot; Feisal of the Jerba Shummar&quot; was leaving Mecca for Mesopotamia on the following clay.PERSIA.Financial Reorganisation. On the 6th- August Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Mr. Scott at Teheran [No. 218] informing him that the French Government (which desired to undertake nothing in Persia except in complete agreement with us) had enquired as to the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the draft of a scheme of financial reorganisation requiring French experts, which, according to the French Minister at Tehran, had been submitted to Mr. Scott and the Russian Minister. Mr. Balfour asked whether M. Bizot had been again suggested and said that after Mr. Scott had discussed the matter with M. cle Etter he should be glad to have his views. Mr. Scott replied on the 9th August [No. 277] saying that beyond the proposal reported by telegram on the 31st July [Eastern Report XXVII, p. 8] none had been made by the Persian Government, and from the explanation which the French Minister had given it was clear that the communication made by the French Government was made on its Ministers despatch reporting the Persian Governments note of the 2nd May [Eastern Report XV, p. 6].-&apos; INDIA.The Mahsuds. The Viceroy telegraphed on the 11th August that on the previous day, in the presence of Sir J. Donald and General Beynon, a jirga was held at Sarwekai and was attended by 3,000 Mahsuds. A solemn declaration of peace was made by the the tribe and Sir J. Donald announced that the Mahsucls were free to resume trade with British territory ; a written agreement accepting all the conditions had first been signed and the Dodds case settled on oath. The attitude of those present at the jirga was orderly and satisfactory throughout. The Mahsuds had been informed that military prisoners would be released and their allowances recommence when they had brought back the last recoverable rifle ; they had given guarantees for the seventy-eight which had not yet been handed in.
LATEST  INTELLIGENCE.RUSSIA.The Neiv Minister for War and the Army. On the&apos; 13th August Sir George Buchanan transmitted [No. 1245] a telegram from the military attache, who had had an interview with M. Savinkov, the new Minister for War. M. Savinkov said that it was impossible to proceed with any contentious measure, such as the militarisation of labour, so long as a Minister who would not risk his popularity remained in the Government he was referring to M. Tchernoff; Russia, was now passing through a crisis which was.at once financial, economic, and military, and its future depended on whether [ ? the command] would take a strong line. Russia would be ruined by a separate peace or by one in which it had no voice; and another thing which people forgot was that demobilisation was impossible in view of the present condition of the Russian army, for the troops would destroy everything on their way home. He agreed that the object to aim at was to make the best soldier look up to the worst officer, but he added that he must work to this object gradually. The restoration of discipline in Petrograd and Oronstadt was delayed by the interference of the Sovyet, whose influence, however, was on the wane, and he was determined to fight it to the utmost of his power. He was, he said, in complete agreement with the Commander-in-Chief, who would be given a free hand so long as he himself remained in the Government. The military attache said that M. Tereschenko had told him that he would find M. Savinkov a strong man ; he himself thought that confidence might be placed in him as a man who was absolutely fearless and would do his best.M. Tereschenko on a Winter Campaign. In the same telegram the military attache said that he had asked M. Tereschenko whether he really thought that Russia could continue the war through the winter, and had suggested that there were three internal causes which might interfere with it  the breakdown of the railways, the general economic situation, and the peasants holding back grain. He replied on the general point that they &quot;bad to think of it,&quot; adding that, after he had stated in a speech that it was Russia&apos;s duty to prepare for;a winter campaign, he had received several abusive letters from soldiers. As to the three obstructive conditions, he said that he thought that the economic situation would right itself, and that workmen would accept such wages as their employers could afford to pay, after they, the workmen, had starved for a little and perhaps burnt a factory or two in which opinion the military attache said, he was more optimistic than the majority, who thought that before the workmen learnt sense there would be much murder and arson ; as to the second point, the Minister of Communications was in close touch with the American railway mission, and the Government would militarise the railways as soon as they had an excuse for so doing; the third, the holding back of grain, was the most difficult of all, three-fourths of the Government, he said, were opposed to the monopoly policy, but he did not indicate how the Government proposed to obtain grain from the peasants when there were no goods to barter.POLAND.The I&apos;ope&apos;s Letter. In a letter which the Pope has addressed to the belligerent Powers, his Holiness invites them to consider proposals for the diminution of armaments, the institution of arbitration, &quot; freedom of the seas,&quot; a general condonation as to damage with certain exceptions, reciprocal restitution of occupied territory, and an examination in a conciliatory spirit of other territorial questions. In regard to the last-mentioned item, his Holiness says : -As regards territorial questions like those at issue between Italy and Austria and between Germany and France, there is reason to hope that, in consideration of the immense advantages of a lasting peace with disarmament, the parties in conflict will examine them in a conciliatory spirit, taking account, in the. measure of what is, just and possible, as we have before said, of the aspirations of the peoples, and, as occasion may offer, co ordinating particular interests with the general weal of the great human society. The same spirit of equity and justice must reign in the study of the other territorial and political questions, notably those relating to Armenia, the Balkan States, and to the territories forming part of the ancient Kingdom of Poland, to which, in particular, its
aoble historical traditions and the sufferings endured, especially during the present war, ought justly to assure the sympathies of nations.Germany and Independent Poland [see Eastern Report XVIII, p. 9j. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed on the 14th August [No. 679] that he had been informed by the American Minister of a conversation between a reliable person and an extreme Socialist member of the Prussian Parliament. In Germany, the latter said, there was a growing tendency to &quot; a reasonable peace,&quot; by which was meant the inclusion of Prussian Poland in an independent Polish State and the making of Alsace-Lorraine an independent buffer State.THE SENOTJSSI.Said Mohammed Idris. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 12th August [No. 847] that Said Mohammed Idris had suggested in letters recently received that he might require additional support from the Italians in Tripoli, and that he (Sir R. Wingate) had mentioned this to the Italian Minister, urging at the same time the desirability of affording him all possible means of strengthening his position and combating hostile influences. The matter was mainly an Italian interest, but a defeat of Idris followed by his disappearance from the scene might seriously affect the situation on the Egyptian frontier, which at present was satisfactory. It was tovbe hoped that the Italian authorities in Tripoli were alive to the necessity of affording him adequate material support; if Colonel Talbofs original view was sound (as so far as he was able to judge he believed it to be) that the hinterland tribes could only be weaned from enemy influences through Mohammed Idris. Sir R. Wingate understood that the Italian Minister had telegraphed privately to Rome on the subject.Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir R. Rodd on the 15th August [No. 1485] instructing him to support, discreetly but firmly, the suggestion that the Italians in Tripoli should give Mahommed Idris more assistance.ARABIA.Yemen.The Italian Press. A correspondent has sent from Egypt translations (in French) of extracts from Italian newspapers in regard to our relations with Yemen. A translation of this translation (the original has not been seen) is as follows : &quot; The English have retired from Port Salif.&quot; Under this heading the Italian papers of the 1.8th June published the following telegram from Port Said :The British troops who had lauded at Port Salif have retired after having captured the plant of the Saltpans which was the object of their action in this port.The Idea Nazionale (Rome) of the 19th June made the following comment on this telegram : We said yesterday that the English occupation of the port of Salif on the Yemen coast should be regarded as an act of a purely provisional and military character. That has been confirmed to-day by a telegram which makes clear the objects of the landing and announces the subsequent withdrawal of the British troops from the port in question. Nothing else was possible on the understanding that our English allies were not ignorant of the privileged position which is our right in all that concerns this part of the eastern coast of the Red Sea, which comprises the Yemen region, over which the rights of Italy are indisputable, depending as they do on geographical, ethnographical, military, and economic reasons.
APPENDIX. HReligious-Political Situation in the Soudan and East Aekica.[The following note on the memorandum prepared by Captains Willis and Phillips was written by an officer of great experience.]With reference to the Eastern Report No. 26 (Appendix), there is, in my opinion, no doubt both that Mohammedanism is accepted readily by many of the pagan African tribes and is gradually spreading southwards, and also that Ethiopianism, which is equally acceptable to the native temperament and particularly so to the partially educated, is spreading northwards and eastwards. Of the two, Ethiopianism (which I do not think finds its source in Abyssinia) is, I believe, by far the more dangerous to the white race, playing as it does upon the characteristic conceit and excitability of the African.It is likely that, in the future, the British Empire, as holding and controlling the greatest areas in Africa, may provide a focussing point for a great rebellion of black against white, and the Britisher will probably be regarded as the chief enemy of the black man, or at least of the Bantu race, in which most of the converts to Ethiopianism will be found.With regard to the spread of these two religions, it is proba,bly correct to suppose that one or the other of them will eventually absorb practically all the natives of Africa unless steps are taken to limit and counteract their growth, and it would probably be agreed among students of native affairs that, in consequence of the effect of the war, such steps cannot be taken too soon.Assuming that Captains Willis and Phillips are correct in urging that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be one of developing national feeling within its natural divisions and developing also the &quot; insulating area,&quot; which spreads from Abyssinia, with its debased but ancient Christianity, to Lakes Albert and Victoria, and which is peopled by pagans untouched by any religion and Buganda Roman Catholics and Protestants, it would seem that as a first step the establishment of secular schools may assist towards this end, provided these schools are carefully controlled and guided by policy with this definite object in view. In them the spirit of nationality, or perhaps it would be more correct to say of the tribe, should be cultivated, and nowhere can this be done with better&apos;chances of success than in British East Africa and Uganda, where there are numerotis tribes ethnographically quite distinct from one another. It is suggested that in each ethnographic district the schools should, as far as possible, form integral parts&apos;of the tribe and centres of folk-lore and tradition. Their masters should not be changed from one tribe to another, but must find their promotion by the length and success of their service within the limits of the tribe they teach;There would appear, however, to be other methods by which the feeling of nationality may be cultivated. For instance, the missionaries will not for long be satisfied to allow such secular schools to monopolise the training of the natives. They will compete with them and will bring every possible pressure to bear on the Government to ensure equal treatment. It will not be possible to withstand such pressure, and a method must be found whereby the efforts of missionaries may also assist in the cultivation of national spirit. This, it seems, might be done by allowing only one denomination to work in each ethnographic area and not by allowing the same denomination to work in two adjacent areas.Finally and this is a point on which it appears that immediate action can be taken in organising African troops it- should be laid clown as a guiding principle that companies should as far as possible be homogeneous rather than heterogeneous, tribal rather than mixed. This, with very few exceptions, was actually the case in the King&apos;s African Rifles before the war, although the desirability of the arrangement was arguable from a military point of view ; but I am not sure whether it has been found possible to adhere to this practice during the very great expansion of the force which has recently taken place.PRINTED XT THE FOBEIGK OFFICE BY C. R. HARRISON.-17/8/1917.
