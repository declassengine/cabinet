APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT No. LI.THIS week&apos;s report is exceptionally long, but nevertheless it deserves careful reading. ,i: Russia. &apos;\    ;The revolution runs its course. The arrest of the Roumanian Minister is, perhaps less- surprising than his release. However, it is to be noted that, considering; the extreme views of the revolutionaries, the smallness of the actual terrorism is interesting;, it may be that extensive lynchings, proscriptions, &amp;c, may be indulged in before the revolution has run its course. Up to now the bloodshed has been very limited. When it is remembered that perhaps 80 millions of very poor people are in a state of complete anarchy, that arms and explosives are plentiful, it is a matter for some wonder that- more terrible happenings have not yet been recorded.Poland.From private sources of information it is learned that Mr. Balfour&apos;s declaration in regard to Poland has been very well received. -        .v .&apos;,,:(Turkey.The Turks are going strong on the Pan-Turanian movement. It is suggested that we should not magnify the importance of Pan-Turanianism unduly in the press.. -It is a danger, but it will not grow less by our outwardly displaying alarm.Egypt.The Egyptian Nationalists&apos; communication to Lenin -is to be noted.Abyssinia.The reappearance of Lij Yasu is to be noted, as a reminder that he is the connecting link between Teuto-Turkish power and Moslem Africa. So long as the Turks hold on in the Aden hinterland the menace will continue.Arabia.The interviews with the King are most satisfactory. Not too much attention need be paid to the King&apos;s irritation at Mr. Philby&apos;s arrival. His reasons are sound, but the affair is over, and Mr. Philby&apos;s journey will have been useful.Persia and Afghanistan.If these two items are read with care it will be observed that there is ground for supposing that the Germans and Turks are considering switching off the Baghdad line to India, and turning towards the line of the Turanian peoples.[898-78]T?.:r:,.7r....r.,T,.T7r,.
LATEST INTELLIGENCE.Russia.Mr. Lindley&apos;s comment on the Social Revolutionaries&apos; programme is to be specially noted.Armenia.This Lenin manifesto is one of the few Bolchevik proposals which is satisfactory. As a matter of fact the manifesto is pretty well a fait accompli in the Russian occupied sphere of Armenia, as the Russians have all gone, the Armenian militia and regulars remain, and for the moment the Turks cannot advance on account of snow.Syria.Jemabs speech is interesting.    He seems more anti-Enver than ever.APPENDICES.Appendix No. I is to be noted as giving a broad view of the south Russian situation.Appendix No. II is of great interest. The Singar lies between Mosul and Aleppo, and if we could arm and supply it it would be a great stronghold for anti-Turk purposes in north Mesopotamia.&apos;M. S.January 18, 1918.

Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the .13th January [No. 112] pointing out that it was self-evident that whoever had business relations with the Bolsheviks, whether such relations were official or unofficial, could only have them as representatives of the British Government. If the embassy had no dealings, direct or indirect, with the Bolsheviks, the only course open was the appointment of a special representative, such as Mr. Lockbart, but: (l) the Bolsheviks would be recognised as fully by speaking to them through a special representative as through the embassy ; and (2) the embassy would no longer have any status in the eyes of the Bolsheviks, and would probably have to go. Mr. Lindley thought that the proper course would be for him to enter into unofficial relations and to employ Mr. Lockhart as his inter -intermediary.Mr. Balfour replied on the 14th January [No. 77] that any course other than the one he had adoptted would be likely to result in the recognition of the Bolshevik Government. Mr. Lockharfs mission would be of a political character, but would have a commercial facade. It was intended that he should establish unofficial relations with Trotsky and become the channel of intercourse between the latter and Mr. Lindley.[898-78] B
M. Litvinoff. On the 5th January M. Litvinoff wrote to Mr. Balfour, from Hampstead, informing him that M. Trotsky, People&apos;s Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, had appointed him provisional plenipotentiary for Great Britain of the Russian People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, and had instructed him to take possession of the Russian embassy in London. In reply, Lord Plardinge pointed out that, as the present Russian Government had not been recognised, M. Litvinoff could not be received at the Foreign Office, as that would give rise to misconception. He proposed, however, that a certain gentleman, Avhom he named, should act as an unofficial intermediary.Arrest of the Roumanian Minister. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 13th and 14th January [Nos. 118, 124, and 126] that he had learnt from a stire source that a telegram had been sent from Brest by Trotsky stating that the Russian division had been cut off from the rest of the army and Austrian officers who were its guests arrested by the Roumanian military authorities. Trotsky had given orders for an ultimatum to be sent by wireless to the Roumanian Government demanding the cessation of such proceedings, and also for the arrest of the personnel of the Roumanian legation and that of the military mission in Petrograd. Mr. Lindley had warned the Roumanian Minister, who said that he should stay in his legation. On the same day he telegraphed again [No. 121] that seals had been placed on the Roumanian legation and the Minister arrested.All the heads of missions had met on the morning of the 14th January at the United States embassy and had unanimously decided to go to Lenin in a body and present him with memorandum of which the following is a translation: The undersigned heads of diplomatic missions of all countries represented in Prussia namely, the United States, Japan, France, Sweden, Norwaj&apos;-, Switzerland, Belgium, Denmark, Siam, China, Serbia, Portugal, Argentine, Greece, Brazil, Persia, Spain, Holland, Italy, and Great Britain, profoundly moved by the arrest of the Roumanian Minister and affirming the solidarity of their sentiments respecting the violation of diplomatic immunities, which have been respected by all Governments for centuries, demand the immediate release of the Roumanian Minister and of the personnel of his legation.Before coming to this decision there was a good deal of discussion, during which most of those present expressed the opinion that a sentence should be added declaring that if this demand was not complied with those present should immediately ask for their passports. It was finally decided to inform Lenin verbally that a number of heads of missions intended to recommend this course to their Governments.In the afternoon the heads of missions were received at Smolny by MM. Lenin and [?], both of whom talked French. The United States ambassador explained the reason of their visit, read the protest, and handed Lenin a copy. The Russians then gave reasons for the arrest, as reported in my telegram, and declared it was intended as a means of avoiding bloodshed. The French ambassador, who did most of the talking, refused to go into reasons brought forward as capable of justifying the Russians. The Serbian minister made a passionate appeal, and the Belgian minister denounced the action as a repetition of the German system of taking hostages. After a somewhat long discussion, Lenin said he would at once call together the commissaries of the people and inform the United States ambassador of the result that night. The cellar of the Italian embassy was looted on the night of the 13th by 150 soldiers, some of whom penetrated to the first floor. The commissary succeeded in dispersing them. This incident was also brought to Lenin&apos;s notice.On the 15th January Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 138] as follows : The Roumanian minister was informed this morning that he might leave the fortress provided he promised to make a representation to his Government in favour of the Austrian officers who had been arrested (see my telegram No. 118). The minister refused to make any kind of promise, and said that he would not leave his room at the fortress except unconditionally.    &quot; Pie left this afternoon on his own.&quot;Ukraine.Recognition of Independence. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 12th January [No. 99] that he had been informed by the French ambassador that the independence of the Ukraine, as a federal state of Russia, had been accepted by France.
The Government and Peace Negotiations. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 9th January [No. 73] that he had received information to the effect that M. Bernatsky (minister of finance under M. Kerenslry) would probably join the Government in some capacity, and that M. Shoulgin (pro-ally minister for foreign affairs) had rejoined it. One of the chief objects of the Government would be to enter into peace negotiations independently of the Bolsheviks. . In regard to this, Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the same day [No. 74] that the press commissary at Smolny had stated that Trotsky had informed the Germans that they must conclude peace with the Ukraine ; and on the following day [No. 80] that it was officially stated in the press that an agreement had been reached between the Bussian peace delegation and the representatives of the Ukraine federation, by which, on the resumption of negotiations, the former was to notify the delegates of the quadruple alliance that the latter would take part in the peace negotiations, and request that they should be regarded as competent in all respects to to take part in future sittings.Bolshevik Propaganda. The consul at Odessa telegraphed on the 4th January [No. 4] that the Bolsheviks had made progress in some of the Ukraine regiments, which could no longer be relied upon ; this information was trustworthy.The General Situation. Sir G. Barclay transmitted on the 12th January [No. 35] a telegram from the military attache, who said that a thoroughly reliable Prussian officer had brought a letter to him from General Alexieff. This officer said that the situation at Kieff was like that at Petrograd a couple of months ago : all the ministers were weak and afraid of the Bada, just as Kerensky had been afraid of the Soviet, but some of them were well disposed. The Rada was very Socialist, and contained many Bolsheviks. The Government was unreliable and losing executive power, as they forced it into making impossible promises and relaxing discipline.The consul at Odessa also telegraphed on the same day [No. 20] that Bolshevism was making great progress and the situation becoming worse. The army did not exist, and &quot; peace at any price was the thought.&quot;Proposed Relief for the Unemployed.-The consul at Odessa telegraphed on the ] 2th January [No. 17] saying that he considered it most desirable, both for propaganda purposes and for the maintenance of good order, that relief, on a large scale, should be given to the families of the unemployed. Lady M. Paget, he said, was about to organise such relief at Kieff, for which Major Fitzwilliam said he could provide 40,000 roubles monthly. At Odessa there were now some 20,000 unemployed ; and here, too, Lady M. Paget, assisted by some other British subjects, was willing to organise and manage soup kitchens. The proposal was to feed 4,000 daily at a cost of about a rouble a head ; the local Rada had been sounded, ancl it would be most thankful for such assistance. The consul asked for 4,000 . monthly for Odessa, and a similar amount for Kieff; the latter would include the 40,000 roubles mentioned above, which alone would be insufficient. Much unemployment was threatened in Nicolaieff in the near future, and if a similar scheme could be worked there it would do much to turn in favour of the allies the extremist opinion which predominated.The consul also spoke of a society which had just been founded for the relief of indigent officers and their families ; in Odessa alone, he said, there were 11,000 who had no means, ancl many of them no clothes, as they had been discharged into the reserve without pay or pension. A good purpose would be served by placing funds at the disposal of this society, and he suggested the sum of 2,000Z. monthly.The Don.General Situation. In the telegram from the military attache in Roumania referred to above [under Ukraine] it was said that the Russian officer in question had reported that though the situation in Ukraine was worse, that on the Don had much improved. An agreement between the various parties had been established by General Alexieff, who was now head of the whole organisation, and Korniloff was taking command, under him, of all troops.Latvia.Protest by Lettish Provisional National Council. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 12th January [No. 103] that he had received from the foreign department of the Lettish Provisional National Council a declaration (1) protesting categorically against any
opartition of Latvia, and especially against the annexation of Courland or any other part of it, or any union whatever of the Lettish districts with Germany ; and (2) proclaiming that Latvia (composed of Livonia, Courland, and Latgalia) was an autonomous state whose constitution would be decided by its constituent assembly and plebiscite.The declaration also denied that the expression of a desire to join Germany, which the Germans declared they had received, in any way represented the views of the population. The organisations which had expressed tbe desire were composed almost exclusively of German barons and their adherents. Mr. Lindley could not say what importance this Lettish Council really had.Finland.Recognition of Independence. Sir M. Findlay telegraphed on the 10th January [No. 143] that Norway had recognised the independence of Finland, and on the following day Sir 11. Paget telegraphed [No. 103] that Denmark had done likewise.On the 15th January Mr. Balfour telegraphed [No. 1] to the consul at Helsingfors authorising him, on the ground that the Finnish Government represented de facto authority in Finland, to enter into unofficial relations with that Government.!POLAND.Declaration to the Poles. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Mr. Lindley on the 10th January [No. 53J instructing him to assure the Polish Council that His Majesty&apos;s Government considered that the creation of an independent and indivisible Poland under such conditions as would ensure her free political and economical development constituted one of the conditions of a solid and just peace and of the regime of right, in Europe.ROUMANIA.Mr. Lloyd Georges Speech on War Aims. Mr. Balfour telegraphed on the 13th January to Sir G. Barclay [No 28] saying that the report of this speech which had reached Roumania was incomplete. The Pilme Minister had stated expressly (1) that one of our peace requirements was the restoration of the occupied parts of Roumania, the complete withdrawal of the alien armies and the reparation for injustice done being a fundamental condition of a permanent peace; (2) that His Majesty&apos;s Government meant also to press that justice should be done to men of Roumanian blood and speech in their legitimate aspirations; and (3) for the re-establishment of the sanctity of treaties.Of course all this would depend on Roumania not making a separate peace.The Allies and Roumania. A despatch was sent to Sir G. Barclay on the 12th January informing him that the Roumanian Minister had had the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to Roumania explained to him. The Minister had said that he understood that the view of the allies was that he should hold on, but he wished to know what their attitude would be if later on the Russian army finally disappeared and Roumania was left alone to face the four Central Powers ; in reply he was told that in that case the situation would of course be reconsidered. He then suggested that in any case it would be desirable that the King should leave Roumania for Russia and that the whole of the stores and munitions should be destroyed. It was thought better to avoid a discussion of these eventualities, and the only reply given was that it was hoped that it would not come to that.Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 10th January [No. 29] that he, with his French and Italian colleagues, had had an interview with the Prime Minister, who in the course of it had said that though he thought the present state of the war warranted the prospect of victory for Britain and her allies it did not offer a hope either of the complete crushing of Germany or of the dismemberment of Austria-Hungary ; he did not see how the allies, even if victorious, would be able to re-establish the old order of things in Roumania. Sir G. Barclay said, in regarxl to this, that as Roumania felt already completely and irreparably isolated, the Prime Ministers view was gaining ground. - Having regard to the Russian anarchy, official circles were convinced that it was too late to reconstruct on a solid basis in time to be of use. They realised, and the conviction was spreading, that the situation could not be changed by financial assistance, alone.
Effect of Mr. Wilsons Speech. Sir G-. Barclay telegraphed on the 14th January [No. 32] that it was to be hoped that the version of President Wilsoffs speech current in Roumania was inaccurate, as it had made a very bad impression, pronouncing as it did against the dismemberment of Austria-Hungary. That such a handle should have been given to those in favour of peace was unfortunate; Boumanians naturally asked what, if America was opposed to their natural aspirations, was the use of their continuing the war. If the current version were inaccurate, it was to be hoped that it would be promptly rectified.TURKEY.&apos;Effects of the Russian Revolution.-An agent has communicated the following details of a conversation with a highly-placed Turkish diplomatist. This official said that, as the break up of Russia meant the independence of the Islamic races . in central Asia, there was now a certainty of the drawing together of the Moslem races in that part of the world, under the eventual authority of Constantinople. He believed that those races would soon declare their independence, after which the rest would be merely a matter of time. As for Turkey&apos;s share in bringing this about, the encouragement of the movement towards the independence of the Moslem races in the Caucasus would be her first step ; after that she would work east ancl south, to Turkestan and Afghanistan.EGYPT.National Party. A telegram from the Egyptian National Party to Lenin in Petrograd has been intercepted. It is signed by Mohamed Farid Bey for the committee. Lenin is thanked for the telegram addressed to Governments generally demanding the liberation of Egypt, and he is desired to charge the Russian delegates at Brest to propose the liberation of Egypt from English occupation. They add that, on account of the geographical situation of Egypt ancl the Suez Canal, the Egyptian question is really international; and, further, this war. they say, has proved that the only guarantee of the freedom of the Canal is the government of Egypt by her own children.ABYSSINIA.Lij-Ya.su. Mr. Campbell telegraphed from Adis Abeba on the 8th January [No. 4] the reappearance to the east of Desie of this personage with 1,000 men.ARABIA.Hejaz.The Jeddah Interviews-SivTL. Wingate telegraphed on the 12th and 13th January [Nos. 81, 83, and 85] in regard to these interviews, of which there were three, Mr. Philby being present at two of them. The King was upset at Mr. Philby&apos;s arrival at Taif without warning and his journey through Hejaz; this had given colour to the assertion that the country had been sold to the British, and had had a bad political effect. ^ King-Hussein was unamenable to the arguments brought forward to induce him to give his consent to Mr. Philby returning by land, and firmly refused his consent.King Hussein expressed gratitude for the increase in his subsidy, and protested that he would have nothing to do with JemaFs peace overtures ; Great Britain, he said, was the only Power able to safeguard Moslem interests.In regard to the formulse in Mr. Balfour&apos;s telegram of the 4th January [E.B. L., p. 5]. The statement of the policy of the Entente Powers in regard to the Arab race was, he said, the basis of his policy. He relied on us to make known to him any modification of the original agreements (together with our reasons for making them) he fully recognising that circumstances might prevent the fulfilment of every point originally agreed upon. He assented, too, to the general principle of the government of Palestine, and confidently left the settlement of the actual constitution to us. He was evidently prepared for the announcement in regard to the Jews, and said that he would welcome Jews to any Arab country.The question of sending an emissary to get in touch with the Moslems in East Africa was discussed, and the King said that he should be glad to do soon a suitable occasion. The proposal to send a delegate to the Syrian committee in London was also discussed ; but there appeared to be a difficulty in finding a suitable man. In regard to this Mr. Balfour telegraphed on the 14th January [No. 65] that as there was every sign of the Syrians of Paris, London, and New York coming together, it was very.desirable [898-78] C
that a delegate from Hejaz should reach London at an early date, one who could speak English or French. From the point of view of the local committee Fuad Pasha would he quite acceptable.RUSSIA IN ASIA.Turkestan.Autonomy. Mr. Grey telegraphed from Meshed on the 10th January [No. 6] that the declaration of the autonomy of Turkestan had been decided upon by a meeting of non-Maximalists and Moslems, held at Khokand on the 11th December. It was at the same time decided that a commission of filty-four members (thirty-six of whom to he Moslems) should be appointed from the various provinces for the purpose of carrying on the administration until a stable Government should be formed by a constituent assembly. With a view to concerted action this committee would enter into relations with the Caucasus and the Cossacks. The scheme was only in its initial stage ; but&apos; it was known that it had nothing to do with the British, and that there were no Afghan members and none from Bokhara.On the 12th January Sir J. Jordan transmitted [No. 40] from Peking a telegram, dated the 4th January,,which he had received in a corrupt state from the consul at. Kashgar. Ferghana [the province which formerly was the khanate of Khokand], was, he said, then in the hands of a council of Moslems, and outwardly peaceful. The Bolshevik&apos; idea was that the Moslem Government of Ferghana should form a part of the Russian&apos; federation, but among the Moslems of the district the prevalent impression seemed to be that the federation was a Turkish one under the Sultan. The point, however, was not clear.The consul also said that it was reported that Khokand had been visited by four men, wearing red Turkish caps, who had displayed a flag (surmounted by a crescent) with the word &quot; Germany&quot; on one side and &quot;Sultan &quot; on the other. These men, who were well received, when in the mosques, invited the people to tender their allegiance to the Sultan. There was some talk of producing as khan the grandson of the last king of Khokand.ARMENIA.Attitude of Bolshevik Russia. Mr. Lindley telegraphed from Petrograd on. the 14th January [No. 123] that the Soviet Government had published a decree notifying Armenians living in that part of Turkish Armenia &quot; occupied by Russia by right of conquest&quot; that republican Russia would support their rights of self-determination even to the extent of complete independence.The Russian Government was, however, of opinion that, previous to the realisation of this right, certain preliminary &quot;guarantees&quot; were necessary, such as the withdrawal of all troops from the limits of Turkish Armenia, the immediate formation of an Armenian militia, the free return to their homes of Armenians, and the repatriation of those Armenians who had been forcibly removed to the interior of Turkey during the war by the Turkish authorities.The decree stated that the Russian Government would insist on the fulfilment of these conditions when peace was concluded between Russia and Turkey.In conclusion, the decree recommended that Armenians should immediately organise a temporary national administration in the form of &quot; Soviets &quot; composed of deputies elected on democratic principles ; and it advised that the geographical boundaries of Turkish Armenia [? should be settled] in agreement with delegates from their immediate Moslem neighbours -any disputes to be settled with the participation of the R/ussian people&apos;s commissioner for Caucasus.The issue of this decree was declared to be due to the undisguised wish of the imperialistic Germano-Turkish Powers to retain by force their authority in provinces occupied by them.PERSIA.The New Cabinet [E.R. L, p. 6]. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir C. Marling on the 15th January [No. 40] that His Majesty&apos;s Government was prepared to support a cabinet formed by either Mostaufi-ul-Mamelek or Motamin-ul-Mulk; neither of them was very desirable, but the advantage of having the moderate democrats on one- side was recognised. The assurances therefore promised to Vossugh-ed-Dowleh might be given to them: Mr. Balfour, however, emphasised the imperative need of the South Persia Rifles being under British officers so long as the war lasted. As to the assurances to be given in return, Mr. Balfour was content to leave the phraseology to
Sir C. Marling; but it must be made quite clear that in the event of any unfriendliness, or even indifference to Sir C. Marling&apos;s representations, financial help would ipso facto cease.Question of the Evacuation of British Troops [E.R. XLVIII, p. 5]. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir 0. Marling on the 10th January [No. 33] saying that the Persian minister had sent in a further note on this subject, enquiring what was meant by &quot;adequate guarantee &quot; in connection with the assurance given by the German, Austro-Hungarian, and Turkish Governments that they would respect the neutrality of Persia, and requesting the withdrawal of British forces from Persia. He had replied that His Majesty&apos;s Government was sincerely desirous of assisting the Persian Government in maintaining the neutrality and independence of Persia, and that he should be glad to authorise Sir C. Marling to discuss with the Persian Government in Teheran the means by which this could be effected in a manner acceptable to Persian public opinion ; but that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not but feel, in view of past experience, gained at the outbreak and in the course of the present war, that the withdrawal of British troops would expose the country to further violations of neutrality on the part of its enemies.Evacuation of Russian Troops. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 9th January [No. 21] that Ispahan had been evacuated.Persia and the Bolslieviks. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 11th January [No. 29] that the Persian Government would not accept Bravin as Minister at Teheran; he had declared himself a Bolshevik (the only Russian consular officer who had done so in Persia), and the Bolshevik Government was not recognised.Seizure of Enzeli by the Jangalis. Sir C. Marling telegraphed on the 13th January [No. 33] that news of this had been received by the Imperial &quot;Bank, but had not then been confirmed. The Jangalis were exceedingly anti-British, and it was said that German agents w^ere working among them.Opinion of a Turkish Diplomatist as to the Future of Persia.--The diplomatist whose views in regard to Pan-Turanianism have. been mentioned above [see Turkey] also said that&apos; he thought that the Central Powers would probably endeavour to substitute a stronger Government of a distinct and open Germanophile character for the present weak one in Persia. The separation of Russia from Persia, by the proposed intervening Moslem States, would facilitate this change, as Russia would have no direct communication with Persia, and therefore German and Turkish propaganda would be almost free in the latter country.AFGHANISTAN.Alleged German Intrigues. Sir H. Rumbold in a despatch from Berne, dated the 29 th December, said that he had learnt on good authority that the Turkish Minister there had been announcing that the Germans had sent several missions to the Amir of Afghanistan, in the hope of persuading him to take up arms against Great Britain. At first, he said, the Amir had turned a deaf ear to their blandishments; but since the Russian revolution his attitude had changed, and it was said that he would now take up arms against Great Britain if he were assured of German and Turkish assistance. The Turkish Minister further explained that the Germans were willing to place at the Amir&apos;s disposal for this purpose those of their officers who were about to be released from Russian internment camps.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.RUSSIA.The Constituent Assembly. Mr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 128] on the 14th January that the officially published figures showed that up to the 31st December (o.s.) 520 deputies had been elected to the constituent assembly, of whom 161 were Bolsheviks   and   267   Social  Revolutionaries.    To the last party must be added
forty-one Social Revolutionary deputies from Ukraine; a proportion of this party, constituting the left wing, would vote with the Bolsheviks on the vast majority of questions. The only other fraction having more than six representatives in the assembly iis that of the Cadets, who number fifteen. The remaining thirty-six deputies represented fourteen different groups, elected on racial rather than on political grounds ; they would probably usually vote with the Social Revolutionaries on matters not directly affecting their special interests.In view of the proposed opening of the constituent assembly in the course of the next few days the representatives of the Social Revolutionary party in the assembly had published a manifesto to the people, embodying a declaration of policy, of which the following are the main points: I. In view of the crying need of Russia for peace, the immediate election by the constituent assembly of a duly authorised delegation to discuss the draft conditions of a general democratic peace, without conqueror or conquered, acceptable to all belligerents. -2. Immediate release from further military service of all who had patriotically done their duty, actually in field and trenches, throughout three years war.3. In order that the country should not be left defenceless during the conduct of peace negotiations, the immediate formation of a volunteer army open to all, members of which with their families to be duly guaranteed in all respects by the State.4. Complete freedom for all peoples in Russia on the principle of national self-determination.5. All authority to be given to the constituent assembly for the adoption of all necessary measures for the immediate cessation of civil war.6. A declaration by the constituent assembly of federation as the guiding principle in the future constitution of the Russian democratic republic.7. The realisation of this principle to be effected by agreement of similar assemblies in the separate units of Russia, so that she may represent a friendly family of free equal nationalities united in a community of aims.8. The economic financial reconstruction of Russia on the following principles : &apos;(a.) Transfer to the State without purchase of all privately owned land, mineralwealth, water power, and forests ; (b.) Nationalisation of coal and other mines, petroleum fields, and railways; (c.) State control of industry, with wide participation of professional and labour organisations;(d.) State control of all banking operations, to secure due assistance of capital for the development of the productive forces of the country and to prevent speculation.9\ The transfer of the financial burden of the war from the working to the propertied classes.10. Introduction of an eight-hours day, with minimum wage.II. State assistance for unemployment, to supply necessities for the labouring-classes.12. Universal franchise on the basis of direct, free, secret ballot. The existing Soviet as an independent free class organisation of the proletariat to be guaranteed complete freedom and inviolability.13. Supreme authority of the constituent assembly properly elected by the peopleMr. Lindley telegraphed [No. 129] in regard to this that there appeared to be no possible alternative to the Government of the Bolsheviks except the Social Revolution-aries, whose programme showed how little, from the point of view of the war, there was to be hoped from the constituent assembly, even if the Bolsheviks allowed it to form a Government.Arrest of the Roumanian Minister. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 15th January [No. 132]. that the United States Ambassador had been informed officially by Smolny at 3 o&apos;clock that morning that the Roumanian Minister would be released. But as far as -could be ascertained he had not been released up to noon.Neio Socialist Army. Mr. Lindley telegraphed on the 14th January [No. 127] transmitting a message from the acting military attache giving some detads of the scheme for the new Socialist army, which is to be known as the Soviet Guard. This will be entirely voluntary, and its members (who will be recommended by some revolutionary
Socialist organisation) will receive special pay and allowances ; their families, too, will he provided for. Conscription of labour will be introduced for all citizens in order to provide supply ancl equipment for the Socialist army. With the exception of certain classes, all other units of the original army will be gradually disbanded: in respect of the excepted classes a process of &quot; legitimate compulsion &quot; will be enforced.SYRIA.Jemal Pasha and Syrian Polities. An agent reports that Jemal Pasha visited Beirut on the 30th November. A banquet was given by the municipality in honour of &quot; Jemal Pasha, Minister of Marine, Commandant of Syria and Arabia.&quot; Commanders of military districts, prominent Syrians, and notables of Beirut Avere present. Speeches were made by Shaykh Mustafa Ghulaini, Elias Fayyat, Muhammed el Abidi, and by Jemal Basha, whose remarks were translated into Arabic by Shaykh Assad Shukeiri. Jemal said : &quot; Every time I come to Beirut I observe that the inhabitants fire very loyal. This has filled me with affection for them. I take this opportunity of offering them my thanks for their kindness towards me.&quot; The object of my arrival in Syria was to deliver Egypt from the hands of the British. I have not been successful in this, but I have done my best to unite all Moslems. That is why at the first I wrote to Emir Rashid, Imam Yahia, and Sherif Hussein, from all of whom I received very favourable answers. I afterwards asked Sherif Hussein to send me Feisal with a certain number of his men, and when he came to my headquarters we discussed matters very thoroughly. I sent Feisal on to Constantinople to talk over matters further with the people there. When he returned, he came to see me at Jerusalem, and swore to me on his honour ancl the honour of his family that he would shed his blood and the blood of his men to defend the honour and religion of his country, and that he would die as a martyr on the field of battle. After that he left for TJm Nakri to get his expedition ready, and remained there six months without sending me a word.&quot; In the meantime, I was in correspondence with his father, and asked him to send his son with 4,000 men, so that everybody would know that Hejaz was on the side of the Turkish Government.&quot; Feisal came to Damascus with twenty men, ancl I received them very handsomely. After some days I received a telegram from Sherif Hussein, saying that his son Ali had left for Medina with 4,000 men. In the meantime I received a telegram from the commandant at Medina, saying that Ali was trying to take the city. The Government refused to hand over the city, as it would have been a proof of great weakness. I then proposed to Sherif Hussein to make Hejaz an independent principality for himself and his sons. The Sherif replied that Enver Pasha had received his son very badly at Constantinople, ancl that he had resolved to break off with the Ottoman Empire and join the British, who were at that time on the Suez Canal, ancl dared not advance an inch.&quot; After Sherif hussiens revolt, the British plucked up courage and advanced as far as Gaza and Bir Saba. Our force was much weaker than theirs, ancl they advanced still further at Abu Ghosh. Thanks to the courage of our soldiers we threw them back from our trenches there, and, as the British had got ready a large force against Palestine, I, in conj unction with my colleagues, asked the Ministry of War to send me big reinforcements. I have received great reinforcements of men and   munitions, ancl these will prevent the enemy advancing a yard. Jerusalem will remain in our hands until the end of the war, and the British army will be crushed as it was at the Dardanelles. For tactical reasons we have been obliged to abandon Jaffa, Ludd, and Ramleh.   These places we shall retake shortly.&apos;: Medina is in our hands, ancl Fakhri Pasha has a big force to defend it with, in spite of the damage caused to the railway by&apos; certain persons who have been misled by British gold. The British have landed at Yambo and Akaba in order to take advantage of the hehp of those misguided people, and to reach the Hauran and Maan.&quot; The British have managed to turn Sherif Hussein&apos;s head by telling him that they will make him caliph over Mesopotamia, Hejaz, and Syria, as we have learned from the secret treaties of the Entente with Russia, but they have stated that thejT cannot give Mesopotamia to Sherif Hussein because they have won it with British blood, and that the best they can do is to leave Sherif Hussein as&quot;898-78] D
governor of Mecca and Medina under British protection. Sherif Hussein was much upset at that, so I took the opportunity of sending him a letter asking him to come back to the bosom of his mother, Turkey, and to leave the British, because they were against Islam and against the Moslems.   I have great hope that he will do so.&quot;I have heard that many mischievous people are saying that Turkey is on the point of collapse. These remarks, of course, originated with certain people whom I wanted to exile to the interior, but whom, out of kindness, I have left alone.&quot; I am going to Constantinople, but I shall soon be back. Be assured that Turkey with such an army can never be beaten. Medina and Jerusalem will always remain in our hands, and our enemies will see exploits of Turkish bravery which will drive them to despair.&quot; Every time I have been to Constantinople I have spoken in the warmest terms of the Syrians, whom I consider as my brothers. Their interest is my own  T stand for them and they for me. It is true that some time back I hanged certain Arabs. I did not do this of my own accord, but at the instance of Enver Pasha, and, as a matter of fact, the executions were carried out strictly in accordance with Moslem law.&quot; You have all heard that Bussia has sent emissaries to discuss peace. Together with Germany we have sent emissaries too. I can assure you that peace is very near, because Italy will do the same as Bussia has done, and then England will be obliged to make terms.&quot; I beg the leading inhabitants of the town to pay no attention to false rumours, and to be.patient during the few remaining days of the war, so that we may reach our goal.&quot;Jemal subsequently left for Rayak and thence for Constantinople, accompanied by Azmi Bey, Vali of Beirut. Before leaving, Jemal said that he would return from ConstantinojDle again to Syria, and that Jemal No. 2 would replace him in his absence.A certain Shibli Bey Mollat [Lebanese Christian and a poet he ran a Francophil paper &quot;El Watan&apos;5 before the war] has been sent to Damascus for the purpose of carrying out propaganda designed to excite popular feelings against the English   enemies of Islam and invaders of Arabia.ABMENIA.Bolshevist Charter. Beuter&apos;s agent in Petrograd sent the following telegram on the 15th January : A decree, signed by Lenin and his colleagues, has been issued to the people of Turkish Armenia declaring the right of the Armenians in Russia and Turkey to complete independence and to decide their own destiny, and stating that a series of preliminary guarantees are absolutely necessary for a free referendum of the Armenian people.   The necessary guarantees are defined as follows : &quot; 1. The immediate withdrawal of troops from the limits of Turkish Armenia, and the immediate organisation of a militia of the Armenian people, in order to assure personal security and the property of inhabitants of Turkish Armenia.&quot;2. The repatriation without hindrance of Armenian emigrants scattered in different countries to Turkish Armenia.&quot; 3. The repatriation without hindrance, within Turkish Armenia, of Armenians transplanted by force during war time by the Turkish authorities in the interior of Turkey. The Council of People&apos;s Commissioners at the peace pourparlers with the Turks insisted on this condition.&quot; 4. The organisation of a temporal Government of the people of Turkish i Armenia in the form of a Council of Deputies of the Armenian people elected according to democratic principles.&quot; 5. The commissioner for Caucasian affairs, Stephan Naumian, is to come to the assistance of the inhabitants of Turkish Armenia for the realisation of points (1) and (3), and to undertake the organisation of a mixed commission to decide the date and the means of removing the troops now in Turkish Armenia.&quot; The geographical frontiers of Turkish Armenia must be fixed by democratic representatives elected by the Armenian people, with the consent of democratic representatives elected in neighbouring countries and of the commissioner for Caucasian affairs.&quot;-[The &quot;Times,&quot; 17th January, 1918.]
APPENDIX I.The New Embryo Governments in South Russia. Memorandum by Lord Milner.There are four separate districts of South Russia, where the tendency to set up independent local Governments has assumed considerable proportions.   These are : The Ukraine. Bessarabia.The South-Eastern Federation. Trans-Caucasia.It is quite possible that none of these movements may ultimately come to anything.&apos; But they all have, for the time being, some importance, and, though differing materially from one another and being perhaps, for geographical and other reasons, incapable of forming an effective coalition, they have at least this in common, that they are opposed to the Bolsheviks, and are striving, amid the general chaos, to &quot; keep their own end up,&quot; and to resist dictation from the temporary holders of power in Petrograd and the north.I. The Ukraine.This is by far the largest in population, if not in superficial area. In consists of a continuous block with a homogeneous population. These are the &quot; Little Russians &quot; or Rarthenes, as they are called in Galicia, the eastern province of Austria, with which the Ukraine marches. They are hostile to the Poles, their immediate neighbours on the north-west, who also predominate in Western Galicia, and are numerous in the Ukraine itself.The Little Russians or Ukrainians constitute by far the largest portion of the population of the rich agricultural country, drained by the Bug and the Dnieper, and forming something like an irregular square from the Pinsk marshes in the north to the Black ISea at Odessa and Kherson in the south, and from the border of Galicia on the west to the Don-Cossack country on the east. This, the Ukraine or country of the Little Russians, consists of the provinces of Poltava, Tchernigoff, Kieff, Volhynia, Podolia, Kherson, Ekaterimoslaff, and Kharkoff. Its centre and capital is Kieff, which is also the seat of the local Government (Rada), the authority of which has been to some extent recognised by the successive Governments at Petrograd since the Revolution.The Ukraine is separated from Roumania by the long narrow strip of Bessarabia, the province lying between the Prutb and the Dniester, which is largely Roumanian in population, the southern part of it having been taken from Roumania by Russia after the Ptusso-Turkish War of 1877-8. Bessarabia has recently set up a local Government of its own.The French are at present making great efforts to organise the Ukraine in conjunction with Bessarabia and Roumania, so as to set up a continuous barrier against the Austro-German forces pressing eastwards from Transylvania, Bukovina, and Galicia. The prospect of success is not great, as the Russian armies on this front are rapidly dissolving, and there is so far no evidence of any considerable organised Ukrainian force to take their place. In any case there can be no question of the Ukraine taking an active part against the central empires. Austrian influence has always been strong in the Ukraine. The president of the Ukraine parliament, Chrushevski, is said to be strongly Austrophil. All accounts agree that what the Ukrainians want is peace. They also want to complete the process, -already to all appearance far advanced, of appropriating the lands of the nobility mostly Polish and making the country wholly one of peasant proprietors. On the other hand, they are not Socialists in the Bolshevik sense. Little Russia has always differed in its agrarian organisation from Great Russia, in that it has been a land of individual, rather than communal, ownership.It is this difference of social organisation, as well as the difference of race, which perhaps accounts for the fact that the revolution has assumed a somewhat different form in the Ukraine from what it has in Great Russia, and that the former has from[898-78] E
the first taken a line of its own independent of Petrograd. This separatist tendency-has certainly become more marked since the Bolshevists have come into power.Some three weeks ago the Ukraine Government (Rada), through its &quot; Secretary for International Affairs,&quot; addressed the representatives of the allied Powers at Petrograd in the name of the &quot; Ukrainian Republic,&quot; to the effect that his Government regarded itself as allied to the Powers at war with Germany and Austria, &quot;and that, while anxious for peace, it wanted to carry on peace negotiations &quot; in agreement with the allied Powers,&quot; and to resist demobilisation, release of prisoners, and intercourse with the enemy [Sir G. Buchanan&apos;s telegram No. 2060]. At the same time, and ever since, the Ukraine Government has been appealing to the allies for financial assistance, and has , apparently been receiving some from the French and a little from us (through Sir G Barclay at Jassy). The latest reports, however, show that it is dissatisfied with the limited amount of funds placed at its disposal. This is due, no doubt, to the difficulty of actually getting the money into its hands, as both the French and British Govern-ments have given their, agents very great latitude in the matter of financial help to the Ukraine.Another grievance of the- Ukraine Government is that it has not been officially recognised by the allies. On the 30th December Major Fitzwilliam, who is now our military representative at Kieff, wdred that the allies were losing ground owing to their delay in officially recognising the Ukraine Government. And this is confirmed by a telegram of General Barter to C.I.G.S., dated the 1st January. General Barter had then just left Kieff for Petrograd. He has always been pessimistic about the Ukraine, and in the telegram just referred to repeats his conviction that whether in a, military, economic, or popular sense the Ukraine Government has little stability. He does not believe that the Ukraine troops will fight, though he admits that the Bolshevik troops are no- better.As a matter of fact the Ukrainians have so far been successful in any conflicts-these have apparently not been very serious between them and the Bolsheviks. They have disarmed several Bolshevik regiments, and have prevented Bolshevik forces passing through their country to attack the Don Cossacks.Their relation to the Don Cossacks is ill-defined. The. Ukrainian Government, though antbBolshevik, is out and out revolutionary. The Cossack movement, on the other hand, though mainly a movement for local independence, has a somewhat more reactionary tendency. Hence there is no alliance between Ukrainians and Cossacks, only an understanding to give one another mutual support against Bolshevik aggression.For the rest the Ukrainians are now (1) opening negotiations with the central Powers for a peace of their own ; (2) inquiring of the Petrograd Government whether it regards itself as being at Avar with the Ukraine. The former step seems inconsistent with the declaration, quoted above, that the Ukraine did not want to make peace except &quot;in agreement with the allies.&quot; &apos; The position of the Ukraine Government is obviously very shaky, and the outcome of the whole movement quite incalculable. The only thing that can be certainly said is that the Ukraine is intensely anxious to be let alone, and is looking in every direction for help to maintain its independence. Whatever can be done to prevent its falling under the influence of the central Powers will no doubt be done by the French, who, under the agreement made at Paris on the 24th December, are responsible for allied interests in the Ukraine, and who have in General Berth elot and his large staff, working from Roumania, a very energetic body of agents. Our own representattives in the Ukraine at present are Major Fitzwilliam and Mr. Bagge, our consul at Odessa, who has been ordered to go up to Kieff, though I have not yet heard of his having arrived there. The most important favourable factor is that, owing no doubt to the French influence, General Tcherbatchev, commanding the Russian forces on the Roumanian border who, recently, with the aid of the Roumanians, defeated a Bolshevik plot against himself has apparently been accepted by the Ukraine Government as the head of their armed forces. The telegrams are not very clear on this point, but on the whole I think this is a correct reading of them, and, if so, it is all to the good.2. Bessarabia.Our information about this country is extremely meagre. Its importance, of course, lies in its geographical situation. A comparatively small though fertile province, with a couple of million people, as contrasted with the 30 millions of the Ukraine,   it  nevertheless   forms  a  link   between  the   Ukraine   and  Roumania.
All that we know about its attitude, however, is that it is trying to set up a Government of its own. This Government apparently consists of very young and inexperienced men, and is, to all appearance, even weaker than that of the Ukraine. Like the latter it seems to be agrarian revolutionary in character, but whether or nob it is really in sympathy with the French attempt to, create a Roumanian-Bessarabian-Ukraine block against the central Powers there is nothing to show, except for the solitary fact stated by the French [telegram from the British Mission, Paris, to War Office, 3rd January], that General Tcherbatchev, has now, by agreement with the Hessarahian authorities, given orders to a Serbian regiment from Odessa to guard the Bessarabian railway line, which is the main line of supply for the Busso-Roumanian front. It must be borne in mind in this connection that the population of Bessarabia is largely Ptoumanian. Bessarabia also has a large Jewish population, in which respect it resembles the Ukraine.3. The South Eastern Federation (Cossacks).In contrast to the case of Bessarabia, there is a great quantity of information on this subject, but it is extraordinarily confused and often contradictory. The following interpretation of it is the best I can at present make of the material, but it may be found to need correction in many particulars.The South-Eastern Federation is in the main a Cossack movement, and its principal centre seems to lie in the southern Cossack country. This country extends roughly from the borders of Ekaterinoslav and Kharkoff (the most eastern provinces of the Ukraine) on the west, to the Volga on the east, and southwards to the northern slopes of the Caucasus. It is important, however, to notice in this connection that the two eastern provinces of the Ukraine have a mixed population. They are less predominantly Little Bussian than the centre ancl west of the Ukraine territory. M.oreover, as stated in a recent telegram of General Barter&apos;s, the Bolsheviks now hold all the railway junctions in the eastern Ukraine, and therefore communications are practically severed between Kieff and the Don.Among the southern Cossacks a position of predominance belongs to the Cossacks of the Don province, which contains the Donetz basin and the southern basin of the Don. The chief cities of the province are Novotcherkask ancl Ptostoff. Immediately south of the Don Cossacks is the territory of the Kuban Cossacks bordering on the Black Sea. The capital of the Kuban district is Ekaterinodar. Further to the south-east again, ancl tending towards. the Caspian, are the Terek-Cossacks, abutting, on their eastern confines, upon a Tatar and Circassian population.The Don-Kuban-Terek Cossack country is a very large and more or less continuous territory, though it has a very thin waist, where the Kalmucks, who stretch from the Caspian Sea south of Astrakhan nearly to the Black Sea, impinge upon it. But there are other large Cossack districts to the east and north-east, though they are divided from one another and from the solid southern block by non-Cossack populations. Such are the Cossacks of Astrakhan, the Ural, Orenburg, and Ufa on the extreme limits ot European Bussia, while other Cossack settlements extend well into Siberia and touch at various important points the great trunk line, which  traverses that country to Vladivostock.It will thus be seen that the Cossack territory, taken as a whole, is of great extent, and that considerable Cossack populations hold positions of first-rate, importance in the very centre of the Bussian Empire. Moreover, they are a very independent body of people, who have always been, in contrast to the bulk of the Great russians, to whom they are racially akin, freemen and landowners, mostly small. In return for military services to the Government, they have enjoyed special jn-ivileges of which they are very tenacious, and, while culturally even less developed than the mass of the Bussian people, they have strong traditions and are, comparatively speaking, conservative... Though not devoid of a certain democratic spirit, they are much less likely to be swept off their feet by each fresh revolutionary wave than the rest of the Great russians. They are frontiersmen, who have for generations been the bulwark of B/ussia against the Turks and Mongols.What their present disposition is we can only guess we are really very much in the dark about it but all indications point to the fact (and their history confirms the assumption) that they will remain intensely independent, comparatively conserva-tive, and will in any case present a formidable obstacle to the permeation of Bussia by foreign influence, while, if organised, they might become a very formidable power. The Cossacks cannot be brushed aside merely because everything has been found, to be in a state of chaos and disorganised at Novotcherkask [vide Sir G. Barclay&apos;s
telegram No. 756]. Novotcherkask is after all only one of the points of Cossack concentration, though, so far, the most important, or at least the one about which we know most (there are some indications that the Orenburg and Ufa Cossacks, who extend on to the trans-Siberian line, are developing considerable strength). But even at Novotcherkask, as later reports show, the forces forming under General Alexeiefl are not altogether contemptible. It is true that, like all these embryo local armies, they are desperately short of money and screaming for financial help from the allies as well as for recognition. The French have promised them 100 million roubles, but it is probably easier to promise a hundred than to get one actually into their hands. And even if Alexeieff succeeds in forming an army, we cannot expect it to do much outside its own country.It is evident that the Cossack movement, though quite different in character from that in the Ukraine or in Trans-Caucasia, has at least this in common with all the rest-that its main purpose is not aggressive, but defensive. These people all want to maintain their own independence and property, and not to be interfered with by Bolsheviks or anybody else. Kaledin has over and over again made this very clear, and though Alexieff-who is apjaarently a stronger man, and is certainly, the main military organiser at Novotcherkask may have bigger ideas, it is doubtful whether even he, not to say the Various political leaders from northern Russia Rodzianko, Miliukov, Savinkov, &amp;c.  who are reported to be at Novotcherkask, will succeed in getting the Cossacks to do more than defend their own territory. But even that may be of considerable importance to the allies, especially if the northern (Orenburg and Ufa) Cossacks succeed in getting hold of positions such as Samara on the trans-Siberian Bailway, and so cutting the connection between the Bolsheviks in northern Russia and their fellow Bolsheviks at Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk, Chita, and Vladivostock. But it is fair to say that about this northern Cossack movement, of which General Dutoff seems to be the leader, our information is very sketchy, and derived almost entirely from newspaper reports. On the other hand, we have it in the official telegrams that the South-Eastern Union or Federation includes the Astrakhan, Ural, and Orenburg Cossacks in the east and north-east, as well as the Don, Kuban, and Terek Cossacks in the south-east, together with the Kalmucks, the peasants of the Stavropol Government, and the mountaineers of the Caucasus. [Sir George Buchanan&apos;s telegrams of the 29th November, No. 1896, and 3rd January, No. 17; compare also Colonel Pike&apos;s telegram from Tiflis, 3rd January, which talks of 145,000 men as being at the disposal of the South-Eastern Federation, though these are apparently only the Don, Kuban, and Terek forces.]This mysterious &quot; federation &quot; is at present certainly only the embryo of a state. Its civil capital if one can talk of its having a capital appears to be at Ekaterinodar in the Kuban Cossack country, and its president a man called Chalmakoff, but what his relations precisely are with the military leaders like Alexeieff and Dutoff is perfectly obscure. The only thing which is evident is that there is some sort of regular com-munication, and a tendency to combine between the various Cossack movements; that collectively they are a considerable force; that their leanings are decidedly anti-Bolshevik, and that where as at Rostoff and in the north they have actually had fights with the Bolsheviks, they seem generally to have got the best of it.Like the Ukraine, ancl indeed like all these embryo states, the South-Eastern Federation appears to aim, not at separation, but at a position of complete autonomy within a Bussian federal union.There is just one more point about the South-Eastern Federation which seems important to bear in mind. The Terek Cossacks, who are on the extreme right wing of the south Cossack block, abut upon Mohammedan tribes dwelling on the northern slopes of the Caucasus. Now it is certain that the Bolsheviks are playing up hard to all the Russian Moslems and, among others, to these hill tribesmen, and that fear of an attack from them is paralysing the Terek and to some extent even the Kuban Cossacks. I call attention in this respect to an important telegram from the military attache&apos; at Petrograd [Sir George Buchanan&apos;s No. 2125], who said that he had had a conversation with an officer who had just returned from the northern Caucasus. This officer argued that in not sending a representative to Ekaterinodar (the headquarters of the South-Eastern Union) we were making a serious error. He said that the cementing the alliance between the Kuban and Terek Cossacks and the Moslem tribes of the Caucasus was the mam problem, and the Bolsheviks were doing all they could to prevent this alliance. The Don Cossacks would act with more decision if they felt that their rear was safe.   The alliance felt that the moral support of the allies was a real want.I call particular attention to this because there seems to be a general impression that the South-Eastern Federation movement is the. same as, or at least intimately
connected with, the autonomy movement in Trans-Caucasia, and that we can deal with the former from Tiflis. I am convinced that this is a grave mistake, as I hope to show presently under the head of Trans-Caucasia. No doubt there are communications between the South-Eastern Federation and Trans-Caucasia, aud to some extent the two may be willing to make common cause. But the two movements are different in character and must be handled separately. To influence the South-Eastern Federation we need to be strongly represented at Ekaterinodar.4. Trans-Caucasia.The southern part of the territories comprised in the South-Eastern Federation marches with Trans-Caucasia, the dividing line being, roughly speaking, the main range of the Caucasus. The population of Trans-Caucasia is made up mainly of three races  the Georgians, Armenians, and Tatars. Tiflis, the capital, is in Georgia, which is the western portion of Trans-Caucasia extending to the Black Sea. In the rest of the country the races are considerably mixed up, the Armenians being mainly in the centre and south about Erivan and Kars, while the Tatars predominate in the eastern districts bounded by the Caspian and containing the important town of Baku.The Georgians and Tatars are each about 2 million strong, the Armenians rather less numerous, though in wealth, culture, and intelligence they are in advance of the other races. The great bulk of the Armenian race, however, are across the border in Turkey, where they form the bulk of the population in six vilayets, extending nearly as far as the Mediterranean. If the Armenian population of the Turkish territory recently conquered by Bussia is added to that of Trans-Caucasia, the Armenians now under the Russian flag must equal or outnumber the Georgians and Tatars combined.The three races have had various feuds with one another. At one time the Georgians and Tatars made common cause against the Armenians. Latterly the Armenians and Georgians have been drawing closer together in opposition to the Tatars. In all three races the revolutionary ferment has been working strongly for more than a decade, and though, except among some of the Tatars, at and about Baku, there seems to be no Bolshevism, we must regard the Trans-Caucasians generally as strong adherents of the revolution. In this respect they differ from the Cossacks of the South-Eastern Federation, as is pointed out by Major Keyes in a most important telegram of Sir G. Buchanans of the 3rd January [No. 16]. The Armenians and Georgians of Trans-Caucasia, core entirely out of touch with the South-Eastern Federation, which, it is there stated, only loosely includes certain tribes on northern slope of Caucasus watershed. The telegram goes on to point out that it is essential to keep a clear distinction in our minds between the South-Eastern Federation (Cossack) movement and the corresponding movement in Trans-Caucasia, which has its centre at Tiflis ; the latter is pre-eminently Socialist, while the former is constitutional with a teudency towards monarchism, and possesses strong military elements. On account of the constant danger of friction between the two it is imperative that they should be dealt with on different lines.As a matter of fact it is quite clear that Trans-Caucasia has not joined the South-Eastern Federation, although there have been. conferences between the parties and a union of the two has more than once been mooted [see Mr. Stevens&apos;s telegram from Tiflis of the 22nd December, No. 7]. What has happened in Trans-Caucasia itself seems to be this : a provisional local Government has been formed at Tiflis for the country south of the Caucasus, which refuses to recognise the authority of the Bolsheviks, though it disclaims any intention of separating from Prussia. The commander of the Caucasus army, Prjevalski, is in sympathy with this movement. But the Russian army of the Caucasus being in a state of dissolution, a new volunteer army is in course of formation to replace it, with the double object of keeping order in the country and holding the border against the Turks, who fortunately seem for the moment to be neither numerous nor enterprising in this quarter. The most urgent necessity appears to be to get rid of the old Russian army, which, is a positive source of danger to the country. In order to do this and at the same time to equip and maintain the new volunteer army, 500 million roubles are said, to be required in the next three months [see Major Pike&apos;s telegram from Tiflis to D.M.I. of the 1st January, No. 192]. The new army, which is in course of formation, is to consist of 1 Georgian corps, 2 Armenian corps, 1 corps of Prussian volunteers, 1 Assyrian division, 1 Greek division. This army will presumably include the Armenian irregulars, who, according to Boghos Nubar Pashas are already some 20,000 strong, and have in Anterik &quot; a popular hero,&quot; a bold and energetic leader. The scheme appears a very [898-78] . F
ambitious one, and it is not surprising to bear, as Major Pike keeps on insisting, that without money the whole thing will collapse. On the other hand, it seems that, given financial support, and sound political guidance, we really have here the nucleus of a considerable force. The new army, says Major Pike, is increasing every day. And again, a militia is being formed in Turkish conquered territory, which will later on become regular troops. The formation of this unit is progressing satisfactorily at present. Two regiments have already occupied positions evacuated by Russian troops, and others are holding railways and lines of communication.Major Pike, who lias replaced General Shore as our military representative at Tiflis, seems an energetic and capable officer. The India Office are sending Major-General Dunsterville and a number of officers to Tiflis, but as they have to come from India and Mesopotamia, it will be some time before they get there. Everything depends on our being able to supply funds to enable Major Pike and Mr. Stevens, our political officer at Tiflis, to keep the new army going until Dunsterville and his staff arrive to look after it. The importance of holding Trans-Caucasia can certainly not be exaggerated, as unless we succeed in this there is a danger of the Turks not only recovering the Armenian provinces, which have been conquered by the Russians, but establishing connection with the Turkish population of northern Persia (Azerbaijan) and with the Russian Moslems, who, as already stated, are being sedulously wooed by the Bolsheviks. Such a combination would present a new and very real danger to our whole position in the east. On the other hand, we have in the anti-Bolsheviks of Trans-Caucasia and the conquered Turkish provinces, especially the Armenians, the nucleus of an army, which, if organised and led, would certainly fight, as it is a question of life and death to them to resist a Turkish invasion.Of all the various districts of southern Russia which are struggling for local autonomy, Traus-Caucasia seems thus to be both the most promising and by fir the most vital from the point of view of British interests. I think we ought, in the first instance at any rate, to concentrate our efforts upon keeping the Trans-Caucasia Provisional Government and its new army upon their legs. If we succeed in doing so, we shall also indirectly strengthen the South-Eastern Federation.But this enterprise, though of the first importance, and in certain respects very promising, is undoubtedly exposed to great risks of failure. It is a race against time, for with the dissolving Russian army roving about the country and pillaging the towns, with Kurds and Turkish brigands from Persia making incursions from the south-east, and with danger threatening from the Bolshevik movement among the Tatars at Baku (where Turkish emissaries are also said to be making mischief), the new Trans-Caucasian army will have to be organised quickly, if the whole country is not to be plunged into chaos. In that case General Dunsterville and his officers may arrive too late, indeed they may never be able to get there. The one thing which stands out quite clearly is that unless we can find a means of financing Tiflis without delay what we have been able to do so far is only a very small instalment of what is needed the game will be lost. If adequate financial help can only be given by enabling the local government at Tiflis to raise a loan, I do not think that any scruples about the recognition of that Government should be allowed to stand in the way.(Initialled) M.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., January 9, 1918.
APPENDIX II.Shaykh Mutlaq&apos;s Mission to the Jebal Sinjar.Shaykh Mutlaq has returned from his mission to the Jebal Sinjar, and gives the following account of his journey  -He got some camels at Istablat and rode across to the Wadi Tharthar, which he reached in a day, striking it at a well called Ahu Khashab. There he met some of the Albu Saqr, under Khalaf-ibn-Suwain. It will be remembered that a part of this tribe name down in June into British territory, and settled in the &apos;Aqar Quf district. The Saqr provided Mutlaq with camels for his journey to the Sinjar. From the point where he struck the Tharthar to Tall &apos;Afar, a well-known village (about half-way between Mosul and Jebal Sinjar), he took sixty hours riding, according to his detailed account of the route. The distance as the crow flies is about 130 miles, and allowing a third again for the windings of the Tharthar, which he generally followed, it vmuld work out at about 3 miles an hour, a reasonable pace. He kept along the line of the valley, because of the existence of wells in it. (This I know to be correct; the Arabs in spring drink from the wells of the Tharthar. The stream itself rarely flows, ancl its water is always exceedingly salt.)   His description of the route is as follows : Abu Khashab, parallel with Samarra. 6 hours Uwaisrjah.6 hours Fuwaitah, parallel with Tikrit. 6 hours Al Murair. 7 hours Abul Bad an.6 hours Zubaidi, parallel with Kharninah.6 hours Abu Gharab, parallel with Sharqat. He found here Jubur, Humaidat, and &apos;Uqaidat Arabs, wdio had come across from the Tigris to escape from the Turks.6 hours Jaddalah.3 hours Najmah, not far from Hatra. Tall, al Najm, marked in Kiepert, but some way to the north of Hatra. The maps here are, however, very uncertain.3 hours Khunaizirat.2 hours Wadi Kasab, marked in Kiepert.    Mutlaq struck it at a point aboutparallel with Hammam Ali. 2 hours Al Jarin. 2 hours Al Sufrah. 2 hours Al Arish. 2 hours Tall &apos;Afar.All the places mentioned are wells. The Wadi Tharthar route is almost unknown, -and it is therefore impossible to check Mutlaq&apos;s statement in detail. He must have left the Tharthar a little to the south of Hatra. The Kasab is not one of its tributaries, but empties itself directly into the Tigris, if it ever flows.He found Shaykh Hammu &quot; in the Jebal,&quot; apparently not at Balad Sinjar itself, but he was very hazy as to place names in the Jebal Sinjar. There is a Turkish kaimakam with thirty gendarmes a few hours to the east of him, at Wardiyah (? not marked in any map, unless it be the Tall Wender in Herzfeld&apos;s map Tall Wardan in Kiepert immediately to the west of Tall &apos;Afar). The kaimakam has no authority, and is kept there merely to give news of tribal movements. He is reported to regard his position as highly precarious.At a rough guess, Mutlaq thinks Hammu may have 10,000 armed men in the Sinjar, but he is very apprehensive of the Turkish force in Mosul, which he believes to consist of at least 20,000 men ; and though he appears to be anxious to enter into relations with us and to co-operate against the Turks, it is very doubtful whether he would take active measures till we have advanced further up the Tigris. He would welcome the assistance of British officers, and he wants money to bribe the tribes. His letter to the civil commissioner is attached. He is at present isolated. Al&apos;Asi, with the greater part of the Shammar, are to the north of the Sinjar, near Nisibin, where they go in summer for water and pasturage; the Tai are in the foot-hills between Nisibin and Mardin. &quot;Both tribes when they are  in these pasturages are under the
thumb of the Turks. They will come south after the first rains. Mutlaq heard nothing of any attempt on the part of the Milli Kurds to cut the i-railway.On his return journey he followed the same route. From Samarra he sent letters through &apos;Ali, Shaykh of the Albu Isa, who have recently come down into our territory, to various Shaykhs of theDulaim (he mentioned &apos;Ali Sulaiman, Hardan, Bashid-al-Salih and also Al &apos;Ajaj and Bazi&apos;, whom I cannot place). He also wrote to Humaidi-ibn-Farhan of the Shammar. Humaidi is at present on the Zab. He asked permission of Husain-al-&apos;Ali, Shaykh of the TJbaid, to come down into &apos;Ubaid country, but Husain refused. There is anger between them by reason of the Jazirah Shammar having raided some time ago the Sa&apos;ih sections who live in TJbaid country and are regarded by Husain-al-&apos;Ali as giving him a general allegiance.Mutlaq heard that the Turkish troops in Mosul are well supplied with grain, drawing on large stores in the ambars of Irbil, but they keep the native population exceedingly short.Among the Arab tribes Mutlaq passed as an emissary of the Sherif and was honoured and welcomed by all on that account.Letter from Shaykh Ilammu al Sharu, Shaykh of Yezidis of Jebel Sinjar, to Chief Political Officer (dated September 5, 1917).(Translation.)A. C.   (May you be in good health.)I have received your esteemed letter with your &quot; mutamad,&quot; Shaykh Mutlaq. It was read out to the Yezidi chiefs. All who were present, and I also, were glad and happy that we could, by all possible means, co-operate with you and become subject to you. We know that your Government protects the rights of nations, and that your statesmanship is renowned.Our friends the Tai tribe are now in the neighbourhood of Mardin, and we wait for them and other tribes to come back in the beginning of winter; meanwhile we cannot operate alone, for we fear the Turks, who hate us very much, owing to our rebellious attitude towards them. We hope that, when the tribes come back and your victorious troops advance, we shall feel safe, and shall then operate against our enemies and yours, the Turks, in compliance Avith your written orders.We have, however, proved our loyalty to the British Government in that we are protecting all Christians now found among us hi the Jebel. They are all treated very kindly by us.We are also busied in corresponding with (the tribes) with a view to bringing them over to us. We regret that we are not able to send any of our relations, for we fear the Dulaim of &quot; Al-Jazira.&quot;We need much money to induce tribes. Your mu&apos;tarnad, Shaykh Mutlaq, is also our mu&apos;tamad in whatever we require.(Signed) Hammu al Sharu.Follozoing Information from another Source.
