SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED EASTERN REPORT No. XL.French Radical Socialist Congress.THIS is included in the report for purposes of comparison with the soviet&apos;s views given in the last number.Russia.The views of the resident Englishman should be read. Like many others, he was, it is understood, enthusiastic for a change of regime ; he is now probably equally gloomy on the result of change.Poland.The Polish situation should be followed closely in the text.Turkey.The Turks are acting as though the moment had come to rely on political action rather than on physical force, which would seem to indicate that they are not satisfied either with their own or with their Allies&apos; striking power in Asia. However, the result of the Italian set-back should be taken into account in reading telegrams and infor-mation regarding Turkey which is anterior in date to General Cadorna&apos;s retreat.Arabia.The numbers given in the Stockholm telegram in regard to Ibn Reshid are, of course, absurd, but indicate an enemy bluff.Russian Turkestan (Teuto-Turanism).The news, both old and new, from Turkestan shows -that the C.U.P. is getting well down to its work. The news of the proposal to launch a German-Turkish Corn-mission to Turkestan only bears out what has long been anticipated. The way in which Afghanistan is being used as a cover for the action of Constantinople and Buda-Pesth is a marvel of good management. The appendix by Mr. Vivian on the relations of the Pan-Turanians with the Indian Moslems is a very able and useful piece of work. However, it would seem as if Mr. Vivian had not quite got hold of the underlying forces which promote these events. It must always be remembered that the Pan-Turanian movement is not the conviction of an enthusiast or a believer, but one of the many weapons of the C.U.P., and is used by them with the same impartiality and coldness as they display in employing assassins, spies, bogus peace proposals, or any other engine of war. Attention is drawn to the names of the Indians involved in this matter ; it is possible that some are resident in England at this moment.- M. S.November 1, 1917.

France was as much against conquests, annexations, and violations of the rights of peoples as she was for the claiming of the rightful reparation, pure and simple, of Alsace-Lorraine and the liberation of all nations who were victims of acts of violence. The treaty ending the war should constitute a society of nations between all countries with a minimum of&apos; democratic institutions who will undertake to perfect the rights of other nations great or small. This society of free peoples should be able to keep the peace of the world if armed with legislative judicial and executive powers, and to prevent the violation of the international constitution. The Congress adopted unanimously a resolution that the French Government should take the initiative in proposing to France&apos;s allies the recognition of the outline of the society now existing between them and the creation of a juridical, political, economic, and financial constitution. Debierre, senator, was elected president of the executive committee. He was the candidate of the advanced fraction of the party.RUSSIA.Internal Conditions. Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 27th October [No. 1707P that he had been informed by M. Tereschenko that the Bolsheviks were planning a demonstration which would take place within the next few days. The plan seemed to be to begin with a demonstration in favour of peace, and then to pillage shops and banks after cutting off the electric light. They were trying to induce soldiers and workmen to join, and already, M. Tereschenko believed, four regiments had consented to do so. He seemed confident that the Government could suppress it, though he did [898-67] B
not know how many troops could be relied od. Sir G. Buchanan went on to say that on the other hand reports of a counter-revolutionary plot had reached him from various sources. There appeared to be two organisations. One in favour of a constitutional monarchy was being formed by many thousands of officers who had been obliged to leave the army; the other, which, if successful, would establish a (? democratic republic). Sir G. Buchanan hoped that the reports were incorrect, as, in his opinion, any attempt at counter-revolution at present would probably end more disastrously than KornilofTs.A Resident Englishman s View of the Situation. We learn from an official source that an Englishman who has lived all his life in Russia, is married to a Russian, has extensive business and family relations among the Russian bourgeoisie, and has had exceptional opportunities of examining the situation (not only from the Petrograd and Moscow point of view but also in the several provincial centres) recently gave his impressions of the situation of which he took a most pessimistic view. Pie regarded a separate peace on the part of Russia as merely a question of time. He demonstrated that the whole of the directing element in the Soviet consists of Jews, and for the most part of German Jews ; that Kerensky&apos;s private secretary, who has enormous power, is a Jew. undoubtedly in the pay of the Bolshevik organisation; that Kerensky himself was formerly in the pay of the International, and that he continues to be in sympathy with the Kienthal group ; that he is a purely opportunist and self-seeking man and that he is merely awaiting the moment when Russian opinion will welcome even a separate peace in return for the introduction of order and tranquillity, to throw in his lot definitely with the Bolsheviki. The more moderate elements such as Tereschenko are merely put there for the gratification of the Allies, and will be swept away so soon as they have fulfilled their function of maintaining the illusion of a possible Russian recovery. When asked what, in his opinion, could be done by the Allies to counteract the danger which was impending, he replied that the Germans, in our place, would immediately organise a counter-revolution while there was still time. When assm-ed that any such idea would be abhorrent to His Majesty&apos;s Government, he expressed the firm conviction that in that case there was nothing which could be done. He expressed the greatest admiration of Sir G. Bnchanaifs skill and courage, but indicated that the latter did not perhaps realise how absolutely inevitable was a final debacle if no counter-revolution intervened.It should be added that this gentleman was doubtless influenced by the large financial loss to which the revolution had exposed him, but his observations are those of an intelligent and patriotic Englishman who has hitherto been anything but a reactionary.POLAND.The Regency. Sir E. Howard telegraphed from Stockholm on the 29th October [No. 3083] that telegrams from Warsaw received that day stated that the members of the Polish Regency on taking office had made a formal declaration that they would direct people towards an independent state on the basis of declarations made by the Central Powers on the 5th November, 1916, and the 12th September last, and that they took their stand upon these declarations with complete loyalty. The German news agency, Korrespondenz Nor den, had telegraphed to Stockholm on the previous day from Berlin that the Regent, Prince Lubomirski, had been charged to visit all prisoners&apos; camps in which Polish legionaries were interned with a view to a general amnesty. It stated that a great change of opinion was to be observed among them, and that the sons of present proprietors would be released first. It further stated that the Council of Regency had elaborated a form of oath for the Polish army. If this last he true it would appeals? that the formation of a Polish army is actually within measurable distance. It would seem, therefore, more than ever necessary that the Allies should take some step to discourage Poles from throwing in their lot openly with the Central Powers.Central National Party. Sir E. Howard telegraphed on the 25th October [No. 3066] that Count Roniker, a pro-German Pole, had recently arrived in Stockholm and had informed two of his countrymen that the Polish Central National Party, to which he belonged, had submitted the following conditions to the Central Powers: (1) The abolition of the frontier between the districts occupied by Austria and Germany respectively; (2) the abandonment by those Powers of all requisitions of Polish property;   (3).  the return of deported Polish workmen ;   (4)  the  annexation  to
Poland of the Governments of Vilna and Grodno; (5) under, an agreement between the Lithuanians and the Poles, an autonomous dependence on Poland of those districts which are purely Lithuanian; (6) the Polish Administration to have full powers of government; (7) on the conclusion of peace, a loan to assist the financial re-establish-ment of Poland. Count Roniker said that if the Central Powers, would accept ancl support these proposals, the Central National Party would take up a frankly pro-German attitude, and even forthwith form an alliance between the new State of Poland and the Central Powers.The immediate object of his visit was to bring a letter from M. Ostruwski to MM. Szebeko and Dobiecki: M. Ostruwski is a member of the Polish Regency, and he invited MM. Szebeko and Dobiecki to go to Poland to assist in the establishment of a Polish administration under the Ptegency.M. Szebeko replied to the invitation by pointing out that at the Peace Congress the allied Powers would have much to say in regard to the fate of Poland, and the situation would not be improved by the creation of a fait accompli which was the result of action hostile to the allies. Though it was indispensable to work for the reconstruction of an independent Polish state, this, must be done under restrictions. The Polish Government should not enter into any political alliance, and above all it should not form an army, as under present conditions it would be deprived of all independence, so for the present in that department the Government should confine itself to the creation of a body of police and an armed gendarmerie. Beyond this it should busy itself with justice, education, finance, and municipal matters. In regard to the seven points, the really important ones were the 4th and 5th-the one regarding the possession of the powers of Government was of no practical importance as the country was under military occupation and the power of the Polish authorities would be necessarily restricted by the Central Powers, and the rest were mainly provisional in character.If the incorporation of the Polish districts of Lithuania could be effected without an alliance with Germany and Austria, entailing a state of war with the Allies, he could only approve ; but an enlargement which would have to be paid for by the hostility of the allies, on account of an alliance with the Central Powers, would be valueless.The Declaration of Polish Independence.-\xx reply to Mr. Balfours telegram of the 22nd October [Eastern Report XXXIX, p. 3], Sir G. Buchanan telegraphed on the 24th October [No. 1690] that he had originally suggested that &quot;reconstituted &quot; should be substituted for &quot; indivisible,&quot; but the French Ambassador over-persuaded M. Tereschenko, who said that the word was used in an ethnographical sense.ROUMANIA.The Question of Supplies. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir G. Buchanan on the 26th October [No. 2203] saying that he regarded, with the gravest concern and sympathy, the impending situation, and he trusted that the discussions of the -mixed committee would begin at once, and that priority would be given to the question of the supplies needed for the coming winter. . There was great difficulty in supplying material from this country, and the Government of the United States would be unable to furnish the supplies required in time for the winter. He was, however, requesting the Commission internationale de Ravitaillement to strive to send from this country part at least of the equipment required for the army; and he was further suggesting that the United States Government should be requested to replace from their own stocks the material thus supplied.TURKEY.The Visit of the German Dmperor. Sir H. Rumbold telegraphed on the 25th October [No. 988] that information had been received from Berlin and Constantinople to the effect that the settlement of differences which had arisen between Turkey and Bulgaria was one of the reasons for the Emperor&apos;s visit. Turkey demanded either further military assistance or instead thereof the revocation of her agreement, with Bulgaria in regard to territorial concessions, as she felt that of late her agreement with the Central Powers in regard to mutual assistance had not been adhered to, and that though she had agreed to sacrifice territorial ambitions and had given valuable military assistance to Bulgaria, she had received nothing in return. Turkey was beginning to realise that her campaigns could not be carried on without outside help, as she felt a shortage of men.   The Turkish military attache in Berne had confirmed
the information in regard to differences with Bulgaria, and had added that the question of some form of autonomy for Arabia and Syria was another matter for discussion.An agent reported that the C.U.P. agreed in principle with the German idea of autonomy, but was divided into two parties in regard to the mode. One party was in favour of an autonomous state run on somewhat republican&apos; lines ; and this party wanted governors to be appointed for periods of five years, the first of them to be Prince Said Halim. The other party advocated the appointment of a Viceroy under very close Turkish suzerainty.Ismail Jambolat. An agent reports that Ismail Jambolat is said to be in Vienna, but the reason therefore was not stated. He was formerly Turkish minister at Stockholm, and on his return to Constantinople was more or less under guard.Jemal Pasha. Dr. Jemil is reported to have met Jemal Pasha in Vienna, and to have been informed by him that he was going back to Syria. The agent who forwarded this information had it from Dr. Jemil, who added that he had been informed that Jemal Pasha had not only reached Constantinople, but had left it en route for Aleppo.EGYPT.The Arab Bureau. The report for September has been issued. It says that Commander D. G. Hogarth, R.N.V.R.y.;has arrived from England and resumed his work in the Bureau in an advisory capacity ; that Major W. Wordie, A.S.C., wdio has been lent by the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, will take over the question of supplies and transport to the Hejaz; that Captain the Hon. E. Cadogan, Suffolk Yeomanry, has been appointed an assistant political officer to Brigadier-General Clayton, C.B., and will work in the Bureau; and that Mr. C. A. G. Mackintosh, Egyptian Civil Service, has been added to the Staff.In speaking of the research wxork done by the Bureau, it says that Captain H. A. MacMichael, D.S.O., who was set to Aden by the High Commissioner, has brought back a considerable amount of tribal and other information which will be incorporated into the second edition of the Yemen Handbook now in course of preparation.The Ex-Khedive. An agent reports that the Germans are in favour of the Ex-Khedive being nominated to some high position in connection with the proposed autonomous state of Syria and Arabia.   [See above under Turkey.]ARABIA.Asm.Major Reilly&apos;s Interview with Idrisi. Sir R. Wingate telegraphed on the 25th October [No. 112 f] that Major Reilly had had an interview with Idrisi on the 21st October at Jaizan. Idrisi objected to the sending of a liaison officer he himself would be willing to receive one, but the religious prejudices of the tribe had to be considered. Otherwise the interview was satisfactory, and Idrisi had fully accepted the terms set out in Sir R. Wingate&apos;s telegram of the 23rd August [Eastern Report XXXI, p. 5], which Major Reilly had been authorised by Mr. Balfour to communicate to him [Eastern Report XXXVIII, p. 3]. Sir R. Wingate added that Major Reilly had also been authorised to pay money to Idrisi.PERSIA.The Bushire-Shiraz Road. On the 23rd October Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Sir C. Marling [No. 287] asking whether he was right in assuming that the latter still desired, for the protection of this road, that Farman Farma should be furnished with a subvention on the ground that the South Persian Rifles would not be able to ensure its opening.   Three days later Sir C. Marling replied [No. 359] in the affirmative.RUSSIAN TURKESTAN.Discontent among the Natives. The commander-in-chief in India telegraphed on the 25th October that the existence of acute tension in Russian Turkestan had been reported by natives recently arrived from Bokhara and elsewhere, who said that it
I 5I would not need much to bring about a state of open rebellion. All races were affected, but more particularly the Yomud Turcoman and the Esbegs, who* had been obtaining arms and ammunition.    Afghan instigation was believed to be at the root of theI  movement both by natives and by Russians, and the malcontents looked to Afghanistan! for initiative. The commander-in-chief thought that if the Amir very decidedly discouraged any overtures, an excellent effect would probably be produced ; it seemedi  very improbable that the Amir should be giving any encouragement, but perhaps thej war party was secretly fomenting trouble.I The following, taken from &quot; Intelligence Summary &quot; of the British military, attacheI at Meshed for the 4th and 11th August, shows that the discontent has been fomentingIf for some time :--I . .1 382. Khiva. According to the press, raiding and burning by Yomud Turkoman inI the Khivan khanate has assumed serious proportions. The town of Gangyn has been If plundered and burnt, and New Urganj is said to be threatened. Certain Russian-owned works have been burned and a steamer of the Khivan Company fired on. The Russian colony at New Urganj have telegraphed to the authorities that both Russian . lives and property were endangered, and requested the speedy despatch of mounted 1 troops, as infantry detachments on the spot were useless against the mobile raiders. Up I to the 22nd ultimo the troops, whose despatch was resolved on above, had evidently not I been sent. Russian colonies in oriental countries are not infrequently unduly nervous, if but rumours current here tend to confirm their apprehensions, and add that the Khivan I Turkoman are being reinforced by others from outside the khanate intent on plunder.General Galkin&apos;s punitive expedition against the Khivan Turkomans last year, St prolific in hangings and forced contributions, which was apparently the cause of the I sudden termination of.that oflaciaTs career, is generally considered to have contributed I towards the present outbreak.371. Khiva. In view of the growth of disorder in the Khivan khanate, Colonel 1 Trisna has been instructed by the authorities to act with resolution, employing, if I necessary, armed force, arrests, and deportations. Thevplunder of the town of Kungrad I by the Turkomans is reported.Native rumours of a serious situation in Khiva are rife.   An sari Turkoman are . if said to be plundering in Bokhara, and general unrest among Turkoman is indicated. I Owing to delayed posts this week, recent news is unobtainable.Teuto-Turanian Commission. In connection with the above it is of interest to 1 note that an agent reports having been informed that at the end of this month a I .Germano-Turkish commission would leave Constantinople for Central Asia, travelling by f way of Persia and Afghanistan, and that General von Henting or Heting would be one I of the German officers and Colonel Asaf Bey, of the general staff, one of the Turkish.LATEST INTELLIGENCE.ABYSSINIA.Expulsion of the Germans. Mr. Balfour telegraphed to Mr. Thesiger on the 18th October [No. 68] that lie was proposing to the two other interested Governments that Ras Taffarbs conditions should be accepted with the exception of those relating to the peace conference and the purchase of arms [see Eastern Report XXY1II, p. 7]. Mr. Thesiger replied [No. 64] on the 25th October that this would enable him to reopen negotiations. In his telegram Mr. Balfour further said that Ras Taffari had asked the French minister at Adis Abeba for 3,000 rifles without ammunition &quot;for his personal safety,&quot; and the French Government had enquired as to whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would agree to this as something likely to facilitate the pending negotia-tions : he asked for Mr. Thesiger&apos;s opinion. The latter suggested giving the rifles to Ras Taffari without conditions as a personal favour, which in the future discussion of terms should be taken into consideration. , &apos;ARABIA.The  Shammar. Sir R.  Paget telegraphed on the  30th October [No.  4550] transmitting a  message  from  the   military  attache, who said  that according to information received by his Russian colleague a conference (attended by Falkenhayn, [898-67] C
APPENDIX.The Convention between the anjumankhuddam-i-Kaaba and the Pan-Turanian Movement. (By Y. P. Vivian, Assistant Director, Criminal Intelligence, Simla.)Three main ideals ,have successively animated the government of Turkey by the Young Turk party since the deposition of Sultan Abdul Hamid, viz., (1) Unity or Ottomanism, (2) Pan-Islamism, and (3) Pan-Turanianism.The first, which was designed to unite under the constitution the different elements of the Ottoman empire irrespective of race or creed, failed owing to the strong national spirit inherent in the non-Turkish elements. This ideal is now dead, and the causes of its failure may have indirectly helped to inspire the third.The second, Pan-Islamism, which was designed to unite, not only all the Moslem, peoples of the Ottoman empire, but all the Moslem peoples of the world, under the banner of the Ottoman caliphate, continued for some years side by side with, and assisting the growth of, the Pan-Turanian movement.The seeds of this third ideal, &quot; venizolos-Turan,&quot; Neo-Turanianism, and (in its most expanded form) Pan-Turanianism, had long existed in the writings and efforts of a few antiquaries. It had been manifested mainly in literary spheres, where a small party were intent upon reviving the Turanian language, literature, and folklore; but it had no political force, and its few apostles were regarded with indifference or derision.As early as 1909, however, unknown to the people, the ideals of the movement spread even to the heart of the Central Committee of Union and Progress, then in Salonica ; and it was already, through Kemal Bey, secretary; the mainspring of the branch committee in Constantinople. From this time onwards political events conspired to hasten its progress and to set it up as the only force possible for the future redemption of the Turks. The Albanian Moslems under Ottoman rule turned traitor. In the Middle East Yemen and Hauran revolted. In all these cases the spirit of nationalism had proved stronger as a disrupting factor than the spirit of Islam as a unifying force. Pan-Islamism had failed to keep the different Moslem peoples within the empire loyal to the Caliph and the Young Turks, realising also, perhaps, that &quot; the impetus that gave victory to Islam is spent,&quot; felt it imperative to find some alternative ideal to replace it. This was to hand in the now thriving Turanic movement, the spirit of which had already for some years permeated the so-called &quot; Pan-Islamisrn &quot; of the Young Turk party.Numbers of societies and clubs, literary, social, economical, and political, were formed under the aegis of the Ottoman Government to revive the Turanian language, literature, and polity, and to eliminate the Arabic and Persian veneer, -which had entirely overlaid anything essentially Turkish or Turanian in the social, literary, and political life of Turkey. A national spirit was to be engendered by these means to -replace the religious spirit which had failed.Islam itself, being essentially an Arabian religion, tended, it was felt, to destroy the spirit of nationality which the Young Turks now wished so strongly to introduce. Islam had therefore to be Turanianised. The Koran was accordingly translated from the universally revered tongue, a &apos; - national&quot; complexion was placed upon its teachings, and even the time time-honoured custom of reading the &quot;Khutba&quot; in Arabic was discarded in favour of a Turanian rendering. &quot; venizolos-Turan&quot; within the empire was to Turanianise the non-Turk elements as Germany in 1871 had planned to Germanise Alsace-Lorraine. Without the empire it became &quot; Pan-Turanianism,&quot; an ideal which contemplates &quot; a powerful union in political and intellectual matters of all the Turks in the world. &quot;** Tekin Alp, &quot; The Turkish and Pan-Turkish Ideal,&quot; 1915.Kressentein, Ibn Rashid, and the commanders of three army corps) was held at Damascus on the 10th September. It was decided that Kressentein, temporary commander of the 4th Turkish army, should attack the Egyptian front, and that Ibn Rashid should undertake the defence of Medina and the occupation of Mecca, which, on account of his knowledge of King hussiens plans, he was confident of capturing within three months. The informant, whom the Russian military attache thought reliable, further said that Ibn Rashid had received some 500,000/. (10,000,000 marks) for his betrayal of &quot;the revolutionary Hejaz army.&quot;
&quot; Turk Ojaghe,&quot;* or the society of the Turkish Hearth, which issued the circular found on the person of Prince Shakib Ghalib Bey, is one of the most powerful of the institutions formed to foster &quot; venizolos-Turan.&quot; It was founded on the 25th March, 1912, in Constantinople with the approval of the Ottoman Government, and is subsidised by the state. It had in 1915 sixteen branches in different Turkish towns of the Ottoman empire, and was then developing apace. \The history of this movement has been outlined with the object&apos; of showing that the influence to which Indian Moslems visiting Turkey have been subjected, especially those connected with the Anjuman-anjumankhuddam-i-Kaaba, are Pan-Turanian rather than Pan-Islamic, though we have known them by the latter name.Pan-Turanianism has undoubtedly been the underlying programme of the Young Turk party since 1909-10. At the same time, however, owing to the hostility of the clerical party in Turkey to whom the Turanian programme was essentially inimical a party too powerful at the time to defy the Young Turks found it safer to conceal their designs under the more acceptable cloak of Pan-Islamism. With the foundation of the &quot; Turk Ojaghe &quot; and similar societies in 1912 this disguise was partially removed, but in deference to the clerical party at home and to retain the sympathies of Moslems abroad, it was never openly abandoned. Pan-Islamism has thus up till now masked the true nature of Turkish propaganda, and actually assisted its growth in unready soil.The Young Turks in the early days of the Committee attacked the wakfs of the Mevlevi dervishes, taught the Turkish troops to drink, openly entertained in Bamazan, and even massacred the Ulema of Constantinople. These were no doubt logical evidences of &quot; venizolos-Turan,&quot; and not, as it has been alleged, of the fact that &quot; Pan-Islamism .... is an occult atheistic force.&quot; At the same time the Young Turks maintained a. fine show of Islandsm, and before their foreign Moslem visitors glossed over the discrepancies of their conduct with a Pan-Islamic flourish. They did not, however, necessarily disguise their objects from those foreign visitors, whom they selected to act as agents for their propaganda outside Turkey.One of the earliest of the Indian Moslems of the modern school to visit Turkey after the eoup oVetat was Mushir Hussain Quidwai, an avowed Pan-Islamist and the real founder of the Anjumah-anjumankhuddam-i-Kaaba. Mushir Hussain reached Constantinople in 1910, at the very time when the Turanian ideal, having passed the exotic stage, had commenced to branch out with vigour. It is significant of the true nature of the influence brought to bear upon this man that, while in Turkey, he took part in activitiesf which seemed, to confuse Islamism with the Ottomanism of Young Turkey, t and at the same time wrote for the press clearing the Young Turks of the charges of godlessness and irreligion which had been levelled by the world against them. Mushir Hussain thus acted on exactly the lines of the Turanian programme of the time.The next Indian visitor to Turkey was Maulvi Zafar Ali Khan, whose pro-Turk activities in India are well known. His visit took place in 1912-13, when the &quot;venizolos-Turan &quot; movement had passed still another stage through its recognition by the Ottoman Government (as apart from the Committee) and the open foundation of clubs and societies. We have ample evidence that the Turks regarded Zafar Ali Khan as an ardent leader of the Anjuman-anjumankhuddam-i-Kaaba, though his connection with it in fact is problematical.The medium, however, through which the Turks found their best opportunity of influencing Moslem India was undoubtedly the Bed Crescent mission, which took Dr. Ansari with many other members of the Anjuman-anjumankhuddam-i-Kaaba to Turkey and cemented Turkey&apos;s connection with such Indian leaders as Mohamed Ali and Shaukat Ali. The Bed Crescent mission arrived in Constantinople at the beginning of 1913. Turanianism within the empire had at that time received vigorous impetus from the defection of the Albanian Moslems, while the assistance and sympathy given to the Turks by this very mission and by some Bussian Moslems of Turkish descent is believed to have inspired the expansion of &quot;venizolos-Turan &quot; into the Pan-Turanian creed.? It is possible that in their nationalistic enthusiasm the Young Turks came to regard the Indian Moslems generally as descendants of the Moghals, and as such one of the &quot; irredente &quot; Turkish peoples, whom the Pan-Turanian ideal sought to unite under one banner. Otherwise it is difficult to see what possible place India could fill in the Pan-Turanian scheme.   However this  may be, it  seems clear that   the sympathies of* &quot; Bugbaghe &quot; is possibly a clerical error.f His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Constantinople. Despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, No. 617, dated the 30th August, 1910.X Tekin Alp, &quot; The Turkish and Pan-Turkish Ideal,&quot; 1915.
Dr. Ansari and the Red Crescent group were enlisted for the Turks on national g^unds without any disguise, and this is supported by the fact that Adanan Bey, one of. the Turkish officials who visited India after the Balkan wars, is a leading member of the &quot; Hayatiat &quot; section of the &quot; Turk Bilgi Derneyi,&quot; a powerful Pan-Turanian union. Adanan Bey&apos;s ostensible reason for visiting India was to thank the Indian Moslems for their assistance in the Balkan war, but he was closely associated with the Anjuman-anjumankhuddam-i-Kaaba group, and it was believed at the time that his visit was really in the interests of Pan-Islamic intrigue.We have not, I think, been deceived as to the nature of the connection between the Indian Moslem leaders and Turkey. We have known the propaganda as Pan-Islamism for lack of a better name, but we have always recognised this particular brand of Pan-Islamism for what it really is. From a report on Pan-Islamism of 1915 we learned that &apos;; the absolute predominance of the Turkish element is with them (the Young Turks) an inviolable principle,&quot; and that by means of Pan-Islamic propaganda &quot; the Unionists put into practice one of their dearest aspirations that of &apos; Turkifying &apos; outright not only their own subjects, but also the Moslem subjects of foreign Powers.&quot;&apos;5&apos; Over a yeai ago we said that the &quot; Indian Pan-Islamism with which we have to deal doubtless aims at a confederacy of Moslem States under the suzerainty of Turkey,&quot; t and when the Arab revolt occurred we were not surprised at the, violent denunciation of the Sheriff by the Anjuman-anjumankhuddam-i-Kaaba, because we had always looked upon the leaders of that society as pro-Turk.Thus the only realhy new point in ,the circular of the &quot;Turk Ojaghe&quot; lies in the information that the cloak of Pan-Islamism is to be discarded and that Turanianism or Pan-Turanianism is now to appear under its own colours. The reason for this avowal probably lies in the Arab revolt, which must have seemed to the Turks the final proof of the inability of Islam to knit together the different racial elements in Turkey. It must further have thrown them back with greater violence upon the ideal of nationality, as it divested the Ottoman Sultan of the strongest of his claims to the oilrphate of the Moslem world the possession of the Kaaba. vIt now remains to be seen whether Turanianism, naked and unashamed, can make any headway with the Indian Moslems. i he circular suggests that all Sunni India will be obedient to the will of Dr. Ansari and his confreres. It is unlikely, however, that a stark political programme, shorn of religious justification, would make the slightest ajDpeal to Indian Moslems, or that the &quot; Pan-Islamic &quot; group would risk its popularity by attempting to introduce it.*&apos;&quot; The.
