j *2L-*      LABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES.(9th October 1918.)I circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions on the labour position in munition industries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I.-STRIKES.Statistics for Week ending the 2nd October 1918.During the week ending the 2nd October, 21,173 days-or less than one-seventh of 1 per cent, of the possible working time-were lost through strikes by munition workers. Although the number of days lost is more than twice as much as in the previous week, when only 9,629 days were lost, the number of strikes during the week was less than half the number which took place in the week ending the 25th September. The strike of engineers at Ipswich, which involved 8,000 workers and lasted for two days, accounted for more than two-thirds of the total days lost.Statistics for September.The following table shows for the month of September the number of persons involved in strikes in each district, the total number of days lost, and the average duration of the strikes : District.

The reduction in time worked during September owing to strikes was 0 * 09 per cent. 1 day in 1,111 as compared with 0&apos;11 per cent. 1 day in 909-in August..Causes of Strikes in September.Out of 55 stoppages occuring during the month, 37 were occasioned by disputes as to wages, including demands for an advance and conflicting interpretations of arbitration awards. Two stoppages were due to dismissals, and nine to the employ-ment of non-unionists or diluted labour. Among the other causes of stoppages were questions of discipline, of the recognition of shop stewards, and of conditions of work.* For the purpose of these statistics, munition workers are taken to include all classes of workers in lespect of whom the Ministry of Munitions would intervene in the event of a strike, (a) in the munition industries proper (metals, chemicals and rubber); and (b) in certain auxiliary industries, e.g., iron ore mining, brick making, timber sawing, &quot; certified &quot; gas and electricity undertakings, etc.A  (33)fifi40-2  Pk 50   125   10/18  B k S  &apos;      &apos;
II. PROTECTION OP WOODWORKERS.A. supplementary Schedule of Protected Occupations, which is to take effect from the 1st November, and which relates mainly to woodworkers, is designed to meet two difficulties one, by far the more important, of a substantive character, the other relating to procedure. Hitherto, woodworkers engaged in the production of aeroplanes have been protected from military service at ages in most cases lower than those at which other woodworkers engaged on munitions were exempted. The consequence has been that woodworkers have taken every opportunity to enter the aircraft industry, while in other industries, notably in building, there has been a marked shortage of this type of labour. Coincidently&apos; with this process and aggravating it, the demand for woodworking output in the aeroplane industry has become less urgent, while building and constructional work has come to be more pressing. To remedy this situation, the varying ages and qualifications for protection will now be replaced as far as possible by uniform conditions for all woodworkers, and a more normal distribution of their labour may be expected to follow. The further main application of the new Schedule &apos; relates to woodworkers on construction for Govern-ment departments. In the past, these men have not been included in the Schedule but have received their protection from the Ministry oi National Service, guided in granting it by the departments concerned. &apos; Being brought under the operation of the Schedule, these building woodworkers will in future be given the right of appeal to labour&apos; enlistment complaints committees, which they have lacked hitherto but which workers under the Schedule have enjoyed. ., j- -Besides woodworking certain other occupations in the building industry are covered by the supplementary Schedule. -   ....
