INTERIM REPORT.

I.

1. In this Seventh and Supplementary Report, the Committee deals with the question of a further increase in Separation Allowances for Wives and Dependants of men in the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force.

The Committee was re-assembled in accordance with W.C.447, Minute 4, when the War Cabinet decided that the Committee should meet in order to see whether the Separation Allowances to the relations and dependants of Sailors and Soldiers ought not now to be increased.

Those terms of reference were widened, after consultation by the Chairman with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to the extent that the Committee was authorised to cover the whole ground of the pay and allowances of the three fighting services, paying particular attention to the question of increasing the present rate of Separation Allowances.

At a later meeting the War Cabinet decided that the question of the pay of the Army and Navy should not be considered until after the question of an increase in the Separation Allowances had been reported on. (W.C.479, Minute 14).

2. The Committee has held three meetings and now submit the following Interim Report.

3. The Committee decided to defer their recommendations on the question of increased pay to a later report.

II.

WIVES, CHILDREN, AND OTHER DEPENDANTS.

1. The Committee summarize their recommendations under this heading as follows :-

(a) That the flat rate now payable to wives remains at the present figure.

(b) That the allowance supplemental to the flat rate payable by Local War Pensions Committees to a wife without children when she is unfit or unable for other reasons to obtain employment should be increased from 4/- a week to 6/6 a week.

(c)


(c)   Tnat Vvttn reference to other dependants who are unable to earn, the supplemental allowances now payable by Local war Pensions Committees up to o3Jr^ of tho assessed depea-dance should be increased to hQ% of the aeoeosed dependance.(d);  That where there io one ohild under the age of 14 in the family, the weekly rate of Separation Allowance shall be increased by(e) That Where there are two children under the age of 14 in the- family, the weekly rate of separation allowance shall be increased by 2/-*(f) thht where there are throe children under the age of 14 in tho family the weekly rate of Separation allowance ohall be increased by 4/-.(g) That where there are four children under the age of 14 in the family the weekly rate of Separation allowance ohall be increased by 5/-, with an increase of l/- for&apos; the fifth and each subsequent child.(h) For niotherleBQ children under 14 years of age, the weekly rate of Separation allowance for one child maintained in ahome shall be increased by l/*.(i) That the weekly rate of Separation allowance for the second and subsequent motherless children maintained in one home shall be increased by l/- for each child.(j)   That these that rate&apos;increases shall be payable as from the first pay day in January 1919, and the supplemental increases referred to in paras, (b) and (c) shall come into operation on November 1st, 1918. ,2.It is estimated tnat tne cost of the above proposals will be approximately  9,765,000 for the three services, but it is impossible to estimate with any accuracy the amount which will be payable for the supplemental rate to the wife without children under the pro-posalo now submitted.A sum of  500,000 has been included in the above total, as an estimate of the amount which will be payable.
in1*   In recommending on increase to the supplemental aliowanco payable to tho flat rate to wives without children, who are un-able to work, the Committee also took into consideration any possible defects in tho present system of administration.It was clear that women were noii wade sufficiently acquainted with the fact that these &quot;grants were payable, find the Ministry of Pensions is issuing a special notice calling attention to the supplemental allowances which may be granted to wives under certain circumstances.The administration by the Local War Pensions Committees of these allowances is undoubtedly very unequal.   The Ministry of Pensions is consequently Issuing a circular calling the attention of such Committees to the   Iterations in the Regulation dealing with thii-.&apos; grant, as recommended by tho Committee * and pointing out that the grants for the Childless Wife are to be paid as a matter of course In every case r/hero the women is unable to work, was unaccustomed to work, or whore she is unable to obtain work without change of residence.   The regulations of the Special Grant3 Committee will be amended accordingly.In recommending that tho supplemental grant of 4/- a week should bo increased by ?./6 the Committee took into consideration the additional grants payable by Local War Pensions Committees and tho Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Committee, which may be summarised as under,(a) An allowance up t o 12/- a, wuek towards rent., insurance premiums, hire purchase&apos;payments, mortgage Interest, if if she can show that her present income is less than her income bofioro her husband1 s enlistment after taking into consideration the saving In expenditure resulUng from his absence. :(b) Grants, up to 10/- a week during serious illness.(c) Grants from the Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Committee if the total of her rent, Insurance premiums, &amp;c,, exceed 12/- a week.In calculating the allowance   payable under (a) the income taken into consideration 13 the Income of the household as it was or would have been in January 1918, but for the husband&apos;s enlistment.IV.SEPARATION ALLOffAUCBS FOR CHILDREN..1.......... i......,........I.....      I       i H.....      -     i. i.....ii mi-     .............1. In reviewing the Separation Allowances payable for Children the Committee took Into consideration the continued increase in the cost of living.
In recommending the rates of children1s allowances - as approved by the tfar Cabinet in their last report (G.217)     the Committee mainiy based their proposals, on a 70$ increase in the coot of living since the beginning of the war.   There is every reason &apos;tt believe-that this increase is now greater.&apos; No decrease can, at any rate, be expected for some.&quot;time, and, as the Committee are forced to recommend, for departmental administrative reasons, that the proposed increases to the flat rate.should not be paid before January 1919, it was felt that any increases recommended should be based on probable further Increase j,A Statement is appended shewing the rates of wiviV and children^ allowances for the Royal Navy, the &amp;rmy and tho Royal Air Porec as recommended in this report, and at the various;periods when they came under review and were increased.i
