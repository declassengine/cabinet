0165/108.11.10.10.Secretary,War Cabinet.In view of the tremendous demands now being made on the shipping resources of the Empire in the Fairopean and Eastern &quot;theatres of war, I do not think we are justified in carrying on the East African Campaign on the same scale as hitherto.The time has now arrived when a radical reduction of the Command and Staff should be effected.It will be seen from a copy of a telegram from General Van Deventer, No. A4293, dated 27.8.18. (Appendix &quot;A&quot;),that he himself considers this advisable, and I think that his suggestions should now be adopted*I attach a statement, (Appendix llBn), of the events which led up to the present organisation of the Bast African Command, together with proposals for its reduction, and a suggestion for the future employment of General Van Deventer.I, therefore, ask that the approval of the Tar Cabinet may be-given to these proposals, in order that they may be carried into effect.(Sd.)   Henry Wilson, General,Chief of the Imperial General Staff,General Staff,$ar Office, S.f.l.llth October, 1918.
SECRET.APPENDIX &apos;A&apos; to 0165/108.FromGeneral Van Leventer, East Africa.ToWar OfficeHanded in 9.35 p.m. 27.8.18. Received   3.15 a.m, 23,3,16.A.4295. August 27ttu64875 cipher 23rd August. 1.   Consider executive command of British troops in the field should now be vested in one field commander, in view ofpresent situation and with object of reduction of staff.   These-forces are now almost exclusively K.A,R, therefore field commander should be officer of that force,,   Edforce staff would bh then abolished.   Resulting reduction of one Brigadier-General, one G.S.O. 2nd grade, 2 D.,A.Q,M.G., one staff Captain.2,   The time seems also to have come to absorb the admin-istration of Noriorce into that of East African i-orce.   Details of reduction this would make possible cannot be given until fuller information, available which i hope to obtain from A.Q,.,E.G. Karstaen now on the way back from Nyasaland.3,. .I do not consider any groat reduction possible at present as regards administrative staff.   Absorption of L.. of C. has much increased work and general headquarters and staff reduced as one L.A.A.G.. substituted for D.J.A.G-. and A.M..S.   Reductions possible as follows :- Lo away with assistant&quot; ...    &apos;provost Marshal CLH.&amp;. and D.A-.A.G., K.A.R.   Reduction of one D.A.Q..M.G. to Staff Lieutenant 1st Class and grading B.C. Lar-es-Salaam to D.A.Q.M..G. from A.A.G,4.    In view of above and the fact that enemy force is now only small guerilla band I suggest for consideration of Army Council reduction of status of chief command which would make further reduction of general staff at G.H.W,. possible. I consider this question is one for the consideration of Army Council, my appointment having been made by them.
JL tf kAppendix &apos;B&apos; tt 0165/108.status op comand in east aphica.i 1.1.1 i-i  ii i-r-Ti-1-&quot; 11   i      - i&quot;i - m wm mmm ^  -i&quot;-jii-.iw...iSinoe the appointment of General Smith-Dsrrlon (later, GeneralSmuts) and General Horthey, in December 1915, the forces employedin East Africa have been organized in two groups, viz:-(a) jPhe Expeditionary Peroe, commanded by a Li outenant-General appointed by the War Office, and administered by the War Office; and(h) the Rhodesia^Hyasaland Field Force, commanded by aBrigadier-General (later MajQr -General) nominated by the War Office but u?.tlmately administered by the Colonial Office.It is doubtful whether this separation of administration was ever really necessary.    Separate commands, however, were justified, if not necessitated, by the distance between the respective zones of operation, the poverty of communications, and the existence of distinct lines of communication and operation.At General Smuts&apos; request, &quot;Norforce&quot; (Rhodesla-Nyasaland Field Force) was placed definitely wider the command of G.0.C.in.C. Expeditionary Force as from 9th November, 1916.    The administrative services, however, remained distinct.The administrative services of &quot;Horforce&quot; were always weakly constituted, and. more or less dependent on the civil administrations of Hyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, and their personnel was largely militarised civilian, in part supplied by the union of South Africa.Whilst the results, in terms of activity in the field, wore highly satisfactory, largely owing to General Northey^ personality and driving power, it is certain that any investigation will bring to light many administrative shortcomings and probably not a few delinquencies, due to non-expert supervision.The process of amalgamating the two administrative services is sure to be difficult.
ip/hen tho German forces were driven from German  ast Africa into Portuguese j&amp;st Africa in November 1917, it was proposed to place all operations in the latter territory under General Horthey, acting subject to General Van Deventer!s instructions. The intention clearly was then to reduce the status of the command.Owing, however, partly to complications with the Portuguese (with whom General Van Deventer had established good personal relations, and for dealings with whom a superior officer was desirable), and partly to the desirability of recognising the interest of the Union of South Africa Government in the newly-conquered territory, nothing practical came of this proposal, and General Van Deventer retained the active command, though he had accepted the arrangement,The situation at present is that General Von Lettow, with about 140 Europeans, 1,000 askaris, and a few thousand followers, - is moving, as a single body, north-east of Lake lyasa, probably in the general direction ITUNDA-TABOM,To deal with him, forces must be based on(a) the Central Railway,(b) the head of Lake Nyasa.Such forces will employ the same widely different lines of communication used earlier in the campaign.But there is no necessity for a division of command.1and none for the presence of a Lieutenant-General with a corresponding staff.In view of the number of troops engaged, and the problems with which the East African Headquarters will have to deal, it is considered that the status of the comand (unified) might be that of a Divisional Ccmmander, ultimately to be reduced to that of a Brigade Commander In the event of a single line ofoperations
operations and, communications becoming practicable.   So long as the present widely-separated lines of communication are necessarily retained, it will be difficult to amalgamate the two administrative services, e specially if this depends on a prior winding-up of the somewhat complicated accounts of &quot;Ilorforce&quot; ,   as to this, General Van Deventer&apos;s suggestions might be asked.As regards the future of General Van Deventer himself, it is understood that he would,not be unwilling to proceed to South Africa on leave before taking up another appointment.It is suggested that he might then be appointed to the Command of an African Division which could be formed out of the various bodies of East and West African troops now being got ready for overseas service,This division might be formed in Egypt and . ould be available for any theatre in which it may be required in the Spring.(Sd.)
