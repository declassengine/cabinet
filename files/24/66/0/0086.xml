RET./^BOLSHEVIK  PROPAGANDA2 / t)(Circulated by the Home Secretary)The Bolshevik propaganda in this country has been so far successful as to create amongst the workers a strong desire to obtain more information concerning what is happening in Russia.    The opposition to the Bolsheviks, which was so marked in the early days of the revolution, is fast disappear-&apos;ing, and people are asking whether Allied intervention was really necessary. The Bolsheviks in this country are doing their utmost to create a working class opposition to the Allied intervention.This attitude of distrust might be dissipated even now, if the Ministry of Information were permitted to give details to the Press of the horrorB of the Bolshevik Terror, but I understand that this cannot be done until the Foreign Office releases the information, and that they are indisposed to allow any publication at this moment which might interfere with the exchange of civilians now in Russia.     I feel, however, that the matter might become so grave in this country that the possible injury to a few civilians ought not to outweigh the need for neutralising unrest here.B. H. T *12th October, 1918.Note:- A telegram received today shows that a mass of Bolshevik literature is on its way to this country.
