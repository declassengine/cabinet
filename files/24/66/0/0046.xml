sr-:\ tx\A^4th - 10th Oct. 1910.1573 KML    Sfeo) Frenoh, Italian and British Miniature at Stockholm have formally associated themselves with tho protest of tho United States Government against the recant exports? from Sweden to Qarmany in broach of the Amerioan-Swsdish Agreement*    The Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs has boon asked to a&amp;dresa hie reply to the Allied Governments oolleotively*The Allied Blockade Committee in London have approved a proposal to allow private consumers in Sweden to import email quantities of Iren^jn^^Itaiian wines outsi&amp;e the Swedish v-ine ration.    Consignees, must be recommended by the Inter-Allied Trade CorMttoe at Stockholm end no individual shipment must exceed 150 litres.    The Central Era-pi roe export to Sweden oome 30,000 litres of wine per week.     Exports of wine from Franca and Italy will help to maintain tho Allied ex-changes in Sweden.        . - *teHEBlAHDS.   There is some doubt whether the Motherlands Government**ci.mummh, awiNMIWlMi t*a*vr**m*iars .prepared to concede full powers to the Dutch delegates who will Come to London to negotiate the general Agreement *    We. are informing the Butch Prime Minister that it is essential that they should be em-powered to negotiate? a final settlement of all outstanding in sues-.An Advisory Committee has been appointed to assist the Dfctoh Minister for Foreign Affairs in economic negotiations with foreign powers.    The Chairman of the now Committee is M- Colyn, who will also be at the head of tho Dutch delegates coming to lon&amp;on.    The Mother-lands Government apparently Intend that this Committee shall gradually bake over the duties and responsibilities of the H.0.$.,* which will in that case only continue m a channel of communication with the j/illies,    M* Valstar will resign if this apprehension should prove ...-reot.     -a have informed hU Valetar end If. Tan Aalst that the
Allied Governments will do all thoy can to maintain the authority of tho Trust, whose position will bo fully discussed in the forthcomingI   negotiations?,8. SPAIN.    The German submarines have resumed their attacks on Spanish shipping.    She Spanish s-s. &quot;FrancoliM was sunk off Gaps Pales on October 10th;   and it la reported that the Spanish 8.3* &quot;Viva Valero&quot; has been attacked off Teneriffe. &quot;tfraaaoll&quot; has been roquisi-tioned by tho Spanish Government and was proceeding to Algiers in bal-k last to fatoh phosphates.I. I^AXY.    The Italian Government have published the ease for the prose-cation against the Filature Casoami of Milan, a firm which figured prominently in the recent scandals touching the export of Italian silk and cotton tp the enemy by way of Switzerland.     It is established that in 2915 the Milan firm opened a branch at Surioh, with the deliberate intention of covering trade between their Italian office and consig-sees in Austria and Germany.    After Italy entered the war large quaa-tities of silk waste were Bold through the Swiss branch to firms in &apos;Austria and Germany.    The Milan firm undoubtedly -knew that some of the consignees of this material were under contract to supply the Austrian Army.3. SWimniAMD.    The United States War rfrade Board desire that the-nego-tiations for a-renewal of the American-Swiss Agreement, which expiredon September 30th, should take place at Washington.     his raises anumber of difficulties.    The renewal of this Agreement gives theAllied Governments an opportunity of obtaining further important son-cessions from Switzerland.    The Swiss might now be -induced to discon-oftinue the greater proportion of their exports to the enemy/manufae-tared/eo?ftowning Allied raw materials.     This would involve nb re-gating or revising Article 10 of the 8*8*3. Hegulatloas;   in either
foase questions of detail will intrude which can only bo satisfactorily settled at Paris or Borne,    A further difficulty arises regarding the 1\Jj,8wls8 timber and milk famished to the Allies under the convention signed at Berne on May 1st between the Associated Governments and Switzerland.     his Convention provides for a meeting of Allied dele-gates at Borne in November to consider its renewal.    Here again techni-eal details are involved which could not very well be settled at -Washington.The United States arc prepared to share with H.M. Government the responsibility of supplying Switzerland v/ith sufficient shipping, to :   carry 50,000 tons of Imported supplies monthly.    H.M. Government eon-eider that in return for this undertaking the Swiss should be asked to continue their present monthly advances to Great Britain (Fr.10.000,000 per month).    It would further assist the Allied exchanges in Switzer-land if they were required to pay freight for the ships supplied in Swiss francs deposited at Berne,ffiSSIA.   A Busslan Mission headed by U* Bronski, the Srade Commissary of the Eusaiaa Government, has been for some time in Sweden negotiating with the Swedish Government for an economic agreement between the two countries.    $here Beams little prospect of any very satisfactory issue. Swedish business men are mistrustful in regard to Russian trade.    The &apos; Russians on their side complain that tho Swedes not only/break theircontracts but also ignore the Hussian Government regulations.    tt. i Bronskl has spoken bitterly of the disregard shown by foreign tradersIfor the Russian regulations.     hey do not apparently realise that per-sons wishing to buy or sell goods in tfassia must deal directly with the Trade Department of the Huseian Government, and that no contracts made independently by private traders will be recognised.BRAZIL*    Coffee prices in the United states market are rapidly rising wing to speculative purchases, and Mr. Hoover considers it essential -to take; immediate action to prevent such operations.    He proposes to
&apos; . 1604prohibit at once tho import ot coffee into tho United States forprivate account.   This action will seriously affect Brazil, and mates it all the more necessary for the Allies to come to terms with tho Brazilian Government in regard to the Brazilian oOffee surplus. Mr, Hoover is prepared to purchase 7,000,000 bags for account of the United States, &apos;Mb leaves some 6,000,000 bags at present stored in Brazil, apart from the forthcoming crop of 8,000,000 bags.   H.M.Government are endeavouring to induce a J3ritish financial group to form a Brazilian, Bank in which American, French, Italian and Brazilian financiers would be Invited to participate.   *ho capital of the Bank would be privately subscribed.   It would be asked not only to,finance the Brazilian coffee crop but also to take over the German interests in Brazil as soon as they are liquidated by the Brazilian Government.tl8* URUGUAY.    A Bill has been introduced in the Uruguayan Congress for ae-[sordlng France a credit of la,000,000 pesos and for increasing the cre-acoordedlit/to Great Britain to 30,000,000 pesos.jif..
