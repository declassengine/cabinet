It Las further provided&apos; that the ship should convey food and other supplies for the use cf the remaining British prisoners.Should sea transport prove impractioable it was agreed that transport by land should be resorted to. &apos;This Agreement was signed in December 1917, but was not ratir fied by the Turkish; Government until the end of April 1-918.During the whole of the. present year hi.3 majesty Is Government have made constant efforts, by every means within their power, first ly to obtain the ratification of the Agreement;   and when .that was effected, to secure the carrying out of it&apos;s provisions..     These efforts have hitherto been fruitless, although every expedient has been resorted to, including .even the promise of remuneration to the officials concerned,&apos; and the payment of small sums of money on account..    Tne difficulty in dealing with the Turkish Government is much enhanced by tne fact isrhht they    are entirely indifferent as to the- fate of Turkish prisoners and evince no desire whatever to see them, repatriated.. -  In the past, wo were able to exercise a certain amount of pressure in connection with a certain Ayoub Sabri, a prisoner to whom at cne time they attached importance, but they now take no interest even in this man, aEd as we hold no one who is considered to be of the slightest value, no threat of, drastic action on our part would be of any avail.     V,e have also good reasons for believing that whereas some influential Turks -are desirous of oarry ing out the provisions of the Agreement and reoognise that the fail-ure to do so is much to the discredit of their Government,&apos;&apos; Enve.v rasha, who has hitherto been the controlling force, is strongly opposed to any exchange, and is encouraged in his obstruction by the Gorman Government for obvious reasons,.In view of tho difficulties attending an exchange by land and the objections entertained by the British Military authorities-to an exchange of prisoners through the lines, our efforts have been directed principally towards an exchange, by sea.     The chief cbsta-cle to this lay in tne failure, until quite recently, to obtain the safe conducts from the German and Austrian Governments.     The latter lias, nowever, now given tne necessary guarantee, and we have been informed that the German guarantee will probably be received within a few days .
. On August 14th we telegraphed to Constantinople to propose to the Turkish government the head for head exchange of all British -combatants who have been in captivity for over eighteen months-, but iii tiler to no reply has been received,An endeavour is also being made to put pressure on the Turks by means of the Austrian Government, as we have recently told the latter that we will only discuss the question of tho exchange cf all their civilians on condition that.they on their side will secure the carry-ing out of the proposals made to the Turks.&apos;The failure to effect an exchango of. prisoners with Turkey, how-ever deplorable, cannot under any circumstances be attributed tc any inaction or unwillingness on the part of   HisMajesty&apos;a Government. It is entirely due tc the obstruction of the Turkish Government and there is unfortunately not much probability of this attitude being roversed until they have been decisively beaten in the field..--  On the other hand certain circumstances afford ground for seme hope.    Mention has already been made of the fact that the safe won-duct for the ship may be shortly expected from Germany,The present Sultan is known to regard Enver with disfavour and may be disposed to overrule ,him. .   A special personal appeal is- there fore to be made to His Majesty by tho Dutch Minister at Constantino-pie to insist upon the carrying out of the Agreement;   .;.nd, luutly, we have received information that a number of British prisoners, amounting to about 1100,&apos; have been collected at Broussa, which may perhaps bo preparatory to exchange.Finally, it should be noted that, in tho event of the failure of exchanges, steps, have been taken to provide the prisoners in Turkey with the netessary food and supplies by alternative routes, and that inspectors from the Dutch Legation at Constantinople are on their way to visit the camps in Asia Miner.The Swedish ilinieter in London, who represents the Austrian, Bulgarian and Turkish Governments here, has suggested to all three that there should be a&quot;conference between us and them in Switzerland. He learns that the Austrians will gladly accept, and there is reason to, think the Bulgarians will do the same.     The possibility of repatriation from Turkey by land, failing that by sea, would naturally be discussed at any such conference, and. might result in some satisfactory arrangement.(Sgd.)
