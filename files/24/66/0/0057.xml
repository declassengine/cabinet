-&apos;-I.il2v^rn went.7pr]K\ou/I circulate herewith to my colleagues a short i^&amp;eactf&amp;ndum prepared in the Board of Trade on.the Draft Bill for the restoration of pre-war practices.Other criticisms have reached rae from the CoaLiliijttt Department and the Railway Executive Committee, but as the-se deal mainly with points of detail I do not circulate thtffl pending a decision on the wain question of principleA.H*S*11.10.18DRAFT BILL FOB THE RESTORATION OF PRE-WAR HUCTICES., The object of this draft Bill, viz., to fulfil any pledges given on behalf of the Government as to the restoration of trade conditions relaxed during the War and the re-employment of displaced 0? enlisted employees, is one that must command unanimous approval.    1 am, however, very doubtful a3 to the method employed.    It appears to me that the proposed Bill is drafted in a form which is needlessly aggressive and alarming to industry:  that it will encounter the maximum of opposition, and that it will be very difficult to pass it througn Parliament.  The measure will be known at once as a Government Bill to restrict production after the war, and it will be contrasted with the repeated declarations of Ministers that our only hope of economic salvation after the war is to securo the maiiiaum of output,Of course if the pledges given can only be fulfilled in this way. there is no more to be said.  But is this the case? Ana is it even clear that tho Bill as drafted does in fact fulfil those pledges precisely - no more and no less? Again, even if this be the case, is it not evident that a Bill drafted in this way (i.e. a Bill which does not, like the Munitions Act of 1915, incorporate the actual agreements and give validity to them, but attempts to re-enact their substance in new language) will be at once plastered with amendments from all quarters which wouLTinevitably change its character, so that when it emerges from Parliament it will probaoly have ceased to be, what it now purports to be,  a Bill to redeem certain definite promises? All recent experience of the Board of Trade shows the difficult? of enacting legislation for the redemption of past pledgee    Witness, the Railway Bill of 1913 to give effect to pledges given during the recentRailway
1(19X i) h)Bailway Strike wtoch was opposed on points of detail oven by those la whose interest&apos; the pledges were originally given; or ths^recent Coal Mines Agreement Bill, the passage of which was difficult, hut which would in my opinion have &quot;been quite impossible to pass &quot;but for the fact that the Bill scheduled the actual &quot;Agreement, which consequently oould not he  wended in detail.I would therefore throw out the tentative suggestion that the Bill as drafted should be replaced, by another on different lines; whose title would perhaps&apos; be a Bill to enforce certain Agreements and under&amp;fci&amp;ngs arrived at during the far, and not a Bill for the restoration of pre-war practices.   The Bill would &apos; enumerate in a schedule references ;to the provisions of certain definite agreements or pledges to which tho Government have &quot;been parties, or which have&quot;been concluded under their auspices relating to&quot;the restoration of pre-war conditions or the ro-eaployattnc of enlisted or displaced employees. The schedule would include the provisions of Schedule II cf the Munitions Aoi^ 1915, (re-enacting the &quot;Treasury Agreement)&apos;, the separate -Agreement with the&apos;A.S.11. which followed immediately aftor tho Treasury Agreement; the series of Agreements as to the intro-duction of women!s labour in certain trades negotiated by the Home Office and Board of Trade, and possibly certain others,The main operative clause of the Bill would be one to set up suitable tribunals to enforce these provisions against any one on whom they are binding for a period of twelve months after the war, and in&quot;case of doubt to interpret thorn and to determine their&apos;scope. There would also have U be some sort of &quot;oontracting-eut&quot; clause (as in the existing draft);but it could I think, be framed on more clastic lines if the Bill were re*casted as suggested. Thus, it might possibly be indicated that if an Agreement is made between representatives of employers-and employed modifying as regards the partita  any provision o&apos;f a * scheduled Agreement; the Ministry of Labour may, if it approve the new Agreement, apply to the Tribunal to substitute it for that provision of the scheduled Agreement so far as relates&apos; to the body of persons on whom the new Agreement is binding-There are no doubt difficulties in carrying out this proposal but there are great difficulties in aj x line of action yet it is ruite impossible to do nothing.
