/ v This Document is the Property ofh GiJfV6 )J 1 ..a-y3 CorernnfKMt.\V, TOY SECRET.76I circulate, for the info nation of the War Cabinet a tiemorandura by the Petroleum Executive on the subject of the Allied petroleum tank tonnage position.llONIAL OFFICE. &apos; W.H.L.5.30.18.The petroleum situation is slowly assuming a more satisfactory aspect, although the minimum stocks in all pro-ducts have not yet been reached.    Attached is a chart showing the position.The close co-operation with the Allies, through the Inter-Allied Petroleum Conference, has enabled a definite programme of Allied minimum requirements to he prepared.All British tank tonnage is now allocated to meet Allied requirements and a portion of United States tank tonnage is similarly allotted.For the last half year of 1918 the position is as follows:-tonsOil to be transported............4,147,290Requiring tank steamer carrying capacity of..... 1,822,90 7Allied contributions of tank steamers (carrying capacity)tonsGreat Britain................ 1,255,932United States................     392,654France.......................        5,0 59Italy.........................       35,494 1,565,669&quot;Deficit of carrying capacity....... 155,788Since 1st July, 1918, the position has been modified in so far as the deficit now apparent has been reduced to.........,..........................   116,387Special
Special attention is drawn to the fact that this deficit of oil carrying capacity renders it impossible for the Allies to attain the reserves of petroleum in     Europe which have been agreed as the absolute minimum necessary for safety..  There is no method of increasing the amount of tanker tonnage except by inducing the United States Govern-merit to allocate more tank steamers to the Allied service, Strong representations have been made to the United States Government to allocate further tanker tonnage and an offer has recently been made to them by the Allied Maritime Transport Council that if they would supply the tonnage necessary to enable us to discontinue the conveyance of oil in double-bottoms the tonnage saved would be given up by the Allies for the conveyance of American supplies. Up to the present, however, the United States Government has only notified their intention to allocate during the four months, September, October, November and. December, a total of lr2,C0C tons carrying capacity which after allow-ing for dates of entry of steamers into service over this period is equal to an average of 45,498 tons carrying capacity, thus reducing the deficit up to&apos;31st December to 7o,889 tons carrying capacity.     Not only, therefore, are we unable to attain the minimum reserves but. we are also unable to release any portion of double bottom tonnage for the conveyance of American supplieso   This matter has again been represented to tho United States Military- representatives now in this country.
