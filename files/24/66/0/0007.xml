HIS DOCUMENT IS&quot;THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)3 E C R E T* (J..

The, provision of suitable supplies must unquestionably increase efficiency.Our experience gained during the war enables us to provide the most suitable equip-ment on the most economical lines.   To allow the U.S.Army Administrators to work their way by costly experimental expendi-ture - to the same degree of foresight and capacity as this country has attained, would be, it is submitted, both unwise and blameworthy.-Comments.No proof is given that, given a few weeks warning, any loss of efficiency would result.    There are ample looms in the United States (42 550 power looms in 1917 working on worsted goods).   Bulk orders are the easiest to execute, and any improvements in pro^ga which we had discovered would be at the disposal of the U.S.A. without any-costly experimental expen-dlture.There need be no . $&amp;creaae in expedition. It, is not contemplatedExpedition in the equipment of the U.S.Army helps to relieve the undue pressure of recruiting overhastily from amongst our olderrthafe as a result any older .and therefore less militarily fltt workers should be recruited, $ -industrial workers, with its in-evitable consequence of disorgani-ing our manufacturing power whilst breeding discontent and pacifism.This is not borne out by the  aafcs of the case. The success of the English trade depends on a wide range of qualities and designs, the patterns constantly changing. Bulk production, however economical in itself would if anything pre-judice this.The fulfilment of the enor-mous bulk orders of the U.S. Army will stimulate and even compel new and more economical and successful methods of pro-duction, thus reducing the cost of our own supply, whilst, creating precedents and practices in manufacture which will remain a permanent industrial asset to the-nation.
(Ml         *.far Office Reaeons.Commenta.Difficulty is experienced in appreciating the argument that v/hat is gained by reducing this country&apos;&amp; indebtedness to the U.S.A. is lost by a corresponding Increase in indebtedness to other countries, for the -sale of the completely manufactured articles cannot but mean1manifold enhancement of the value of the Raw Material &quot;ourchased.The suggestion that by discontinuing the manufacture of equipment for the TLS, Amy our manufactures might be better employed in profitable civilian trade? is open to the reply that in all probability such a course instead of attaining the desired end of increasing exports would lead to the increased manufacture of articles not absolutely necessary and therefore wasteful, whereas every   of manufactured material now supplied to the U.S.-Army Is equivalent to a   of exportsIt is further submitted that the factor of greatest importance of all to the country is to keep the trade intact for post war con** ditionso     So long as the produe-tive machinery :l3 maintained and kept going and sufficient raw material is available, Great Britain should be in a position immediately after the war to compete in any w^rte market.If Government control of raw -materials with its steadying effect on prices is continued during the reconstruction period there should be little danger of the U.S.A. acquiring new business at the expense of this country, more especially if the prices of raw material available in America are maintained at their present high level.The arrangement was quite simple.   We are indebted both to. Argentina and the United States.   If we sell cloth to Argentina and not to the United States there will bo a reduction of indebtedness to the former country which is a set off to a non-reduct ion in indebtedness to the latter country.     Probably there will be an actual gain since the profit in any cloth for the Argentine would at present prices probably be greater than on bulk orders to the.U*S.A.This is a real difficulty and the only one,   Manu-facturers at this moment say they are anxious to export. But it will be necessary to devise a means to guaranteetihi S aThis statement seems to have no bearing, on the case Machinery would be kept going in either hypothesis. &quot;What are jeopardized at present are the trade connections and good will.This is only an optimistic guess.   It is not supported by facts up to date.   The following are the values of woollen and worsted goods from U.S.A. to South America   (excluding wearing apparel). 1913........ 40P304 dollars1917..... 2,292,149      &quot;Bradford manufacturers are fairly confident that they can regain their position in the highest class of article.   Xn all others competition will be severe, and competition which begins in lower grades habitually is extended later to the higher.
\War Off .1 ce Reasons.(8) If the Shipping Controllerfinds difficulty to-day in delivering the requisite raw material, the position cannot out he greatly aggravated if there has to he transported in addition to the raw material necessary for increased civilian trade, equipment which has been manufactured overseas, instead of as at present in this country.(9) In conclusionf too muchemphasis cannot be laid on the importance of accumulating a large stock of Raw Materials in this country, so that immediately on the termination of the ft7ar all energies may be diverted from the manufacture of war material to -   that of \3ivil manufacture *Comments,trIt is doubtful whether there would bo m increase at all, or at an? rate any serious increase, As to this the opinion of tho Shipping Controller would be desirable.Stocks should bn the same under wither policy, If however manufacturers wore able to execute expo civil orders now, no pro&quot; would arise of immediate reconversion at the tor-minatipn of the war to or manufacture.(Into1,)   A. S.8th October, 1918.
