Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office.Germany/017.MEMORANDUM &apos;ONPRINCE MAXIMILIAN OF BADEN.1. PRINCE MAXIMILIAN of Baden was born in 1867 and is the son of the late Prince William of Baden, who was brother of the late reigning Grand Duke Frederick I, son-in-law of old Emperor William. He is therefore a first cousin of the present reigning Grand Duke Frederick II.His mother was Marie, Princess Romaiiowsky, Duchess of Leuchtenberg, a descendant of Eugene Beauharnais.He married in 1900 Princess Marie Louise (of Great Britain and Ireland), daughter of the Duke of Cumberland.He is consequently brother-in-law of the Dnke of Brunswick, who is married to the Emperor William&apos;s daughter, and of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg Schwerin, whose sister is the German Crown Princess.He has the title of &quot; Grand Ducal Highness&quot; the style of &quot; Royal Highness &quot; being confined to the reigning and the Hereditary Grand Dukes.As the reigning Grand Duke (married in 1885) has no issue, Prince Max is heir-presumptive to the Grand Ducal throne.2. On the 16th February, 1918, he gave his views on the whole situation, as it then was, in an interview with Dr. Mantler, manager of Wolff &apos;s Bureau. Among other things he said: &quot;The key of the situation lies with the Anglo-Saxon peoples.&quot;He discussed and criticised utterances of President Wilson, Mr. Lloyd George, Lord Robert Cecil, and Lord Lansdowne, and defined his own war-aims as follows : (l.) Freedom of the seas, the principle of which was that &quot; non-combatants on seaand on land should be spared the sufferings of war.&quot; (2.) &quot; The world must not be divided into two groups of Powers competing inarmaments;&quot;   This implied a fundamental change of spirit in the nationsand co-operation instead of rivalry. (3.) The first sign of this change of spirit would be a general adhesion to theprinciple of commercial peace.   Peace must not result in the continuation ofthe war by other methods. (4.) The black races must not be treated as a mere means to an end.   &quot;Theopening up of Africa must proceed in accordance with the principles ofresponsibility towards the black race and a sense of the solidarity of thewhite race.&quot;He denounced Trotsky and the Bolsheviks as representatives of a system which &quot;destroyed freedom,&quot; while&apos; what was wanted was a system which &quot;protected freedom.&quot;Germany&apos;s historic task for a thousand years (Lechfeld, 955 A.D.) had been to act as a bulwark against the&apos;destructive forces threatening from the East.In German domestic affairs they must cease to charge political opponents with unpatriotic motives. He was struck-with the contrast in England, where &quot; the trade unions had asked the old Tory leader (sic),-Lord Lansdowne, to address them.&quot;3. Prince Max is President of the Upper House of the Baden Legislature. In December 1917 he opened the session with a speech on the situation, in which he made several rather rash statements.He spoke of the-&quot; secret plans of our enemies for plunder,&quot; which had been revealed by publications from the Russian archives.lie talked of those who &quot; sought to unite pacifism as a phrase with the policy of conquest by force.&quot;[367-461DENTIALJOotobCT3. 1918.]
He asserted that Jaures was murdered &quot; by order of the agitators for war &quot; in France.He accused Sir Edward Grey of not having used his opportunity of preventing&apos; war by adopting words like those addressed by Bethmann-Hollweg to Vienna on the 30th July, 1914: &quot;We refuse to be drawn into a world conflagration through the neglect of our advice by our allies.&quot;He bitterly attacked President Wilson, who &quot; had no right to fight in the name of humanity.&quot; He accused Wilson of having sacrificed the interests of the weak and the non-combatants in Germany (piesumably by not stopping the British blockade), and of having insisted on his &quot;formal right&quot; to supply Germany&apos;s enemies with munitions.He brought a quite special charge of inhumanity against the President, and said : &quot; He allowed to be exercised carelessly and heartlessly the duty of protecting our prisoners of war in Russia which he had undertaken. Under the old regime our prisoners in Russia miserably perished by thousands, and America did not employ the enormous means of pressure at her disposal in order to compel an amelioration. In France; too, America suffered the cruelty of the people to subject our countrymen to every conceivable kind of torture and ignominy.&quot;Dealing with the prospects of peace, he said that it looked as if the war must be fought out until Europe was entirely exhausted. Yet they ought not to be deceived by Lloyd George and Clemenceau : &quot; The unity behind the front of which they talk does not exist. Both in France and in England forces are at work which do not want a peace by violence, but only a peace which is compatible with the honour and security of their country. A. sentiment is growing in the enemy countries of which the apostles of war are afraid. The representatives of that sentiment may possibly rise to power, but at the same time we must cherish no illusions. At present they are condemned to political impotence and may long remain so.&quot;Speaking of German domestic affairs, he urged that, although they ought to repel foreign interference, they ought not to be uncritical towards themselves.&quot;There was a German unfreedom (Unfreiheit), but it did not lie in the institutions of the German Empire. It rather lay in a certain mental attitude of wide sections of- the German people. Our enemies speak of authorities which impose their will upon a recalcitrant people, and they presume to adopt the perfectly grotesque role of wanting to emancipate the German people from these tyrants. We can afford to laugh at all that. The fault rather lay in the great willingness of raanv Germans to maintain an indolent attitude of acquiescence towards the authorities without any longing to assume personal responsibility for the cause of the Fatherland. We often encountered before the war this self-complacent individualism, cultivated at the cost of the State, and indulging in criticism without the will to help. Many of the best of us stood aloof from political life because they did not like the methods of political combat. The cheap bestowal of popular favour, which elevated clever and dazzling persons at the expense of able and genuine men, is certainly not a model worthy of imitation. But I am confident that this danger does not exist in Germany ; there are powerful securities in the German character against demagogism.&quot;He appealed to the reserve forces of the German character, which had not yet been manifested in political life, and to the spirit of the great political reformers, Stein and Hardenberg. It was not institutions alone which could secure the freedom of a people. The only guarantee for it lay in the character of the people itself. His ideal was the spirit to which the Emperor had appealed on the 1st August, 1914, when he had said : &quot; I no longer know any parties. I know only Germans.&quot; Unfortunately that spirit had been lost, and the old, evil methods of controversy of the days before the war had been revived. He even appealed for a better spirit towards Germany&apos;s enemies, and said that humanity, as the late Sir William Byles had put it, was longing for the precepts oi the Sermon on the Mount to be again put into practice. The ferocity of the war-feeling must cease.   He concluded: &quot;Might alone cannot secure us that position in the world which, in our opinion, is our due.   The sword cannot break down the moral opposition that has
reared itself against us. if the world is to he reconciled to the greatness of our power it must feel that behind our power there stands a world-conscience. In order to meet this demand we have only to open the doors of our innermost nature ; for throughout the whole history of the German spirit shines the sense of responsibility towards mankind. Let Germany not hesitate to inscribe this device on her flags.   In this sign we shall conquer.&quot;4. The expedient of placing a member of a German reigning family at the head of the Government is not without precedent at any rate in Prussia, where Prince Karl Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringeu was President of a somewhat Liberal Ministry when the Prince of Prussia, afterwards King and Emperor William I, assumed the itegency during the last years of Frederick William IV. The Principality of Hohenzollern-lSigmaringen had, however, been incorporated for purposes of administration in Prussia in 1849 (the House retaining its titles and residences). Prince Hohenlohe, who was Chancellor from 1895 to 1900, was of a mediatized house; and Prince Ernest of Hohenlohe-Langenburg was for a few months Colonial Secretary under Prince BuTow.5. It may he doubted whether the excellent sentiments expressed by Prince Max of Baden in his address to the Bavarian Upper Chamber (quoted above) suffice to indicate the possession of the qualities which would enable him to ride the whirlwind and direct the storm in the present German crisis. For the free play of political life, as he admits in that address, a great deal of give and take is required, and it will be difficult for the German deputies, except the extreme Socialists, to cross swords in debate with a Grand Ducal Highness. That was the case even with Prince Hohenlohe and Prince Ernest of ITohenlohe-Langenburg. The Baden family have traditions of Liberalism, but Royalty cannot with advantage iay aside its prerogatives and descend into the political arena. Political grievances and sentiments of opposition which may be repressed in deference to a Grand Ducal Chancellor may find other and dangerous vent.It may be admitted, however, that the appointment of a member of a German sovereign house to the Chancellorship and the presidency of the Federal Council has a certain fitness, as being calculated to bring out the fact that the only body in the Imperial Constitution which fills the place at once of a Cabinet and of a Second Chamber is representative of nothing save the German sovereignties, including, it is true, the three republican oligarchies of Hamburg, Liibeck, and Bremen.6. From such information as is available regarding the Grand Ducal family of Baden it would appear that Prince Max is a man of some character and of considerable ability. He is described as being animated by a spirit very different from that of Prussianism. Those who enjoy his personal acquaintance believe that the whole conception aud conduct of the war has been repugnant to Prince Max&apos;s ideas.The relations of Prince Max with the Dowager Grand Duchess now close upon 80 years of age who has always been prominent and influential in the life of the German Empire, are more those of a son than of a nephew. She has a great regard for him, and a very good opinion of him. It is stated, by the way, that she does not at all care for her grand-nephew, the German Crown Prince. The Dowager Grand Duchess, who enjoys the unbounded respect of her nephew, the Emperor William, as being the sole Royal survivor of the great age of the Hohenzollerns, is a woman of real strength and charm of character. She influenced and guided her husband, the late Grand Duke Frederick I, who played a liberalising and reconciling part in the foundation of the German Empire ; she also possessed influence with her father, the Emperor William I. The Grand Duke and Duchess had a small palace in Berlin, Unter den Linden, next door to that of the old Emperor, and connected with it by a passage over an archway. They spent a month or two in Berlin every year, and were very popular with the Berliners, who spoke of them familiarly as &quot;die Badeuser Herrschaften.&quot;The Dowager Grand Duchess is a woman of deep religious feeling but with liberal views like those of the German Protestants of the last generation, and quite different from the official bigotry of certain circles in Berlin.Her influence was long exerted to save the present Empeior from the clutches of the military party, whose ultimate supremacy in his counsels she deplored. We even have evidence that the Dowager Grand Duchess and Prince Max had endeavoured before the war to inflence Admiral Tirpitz in favour of their views, and that Tirpitz, when in their presence, had given his conceptions of Anglo-German relations a distinctly conciliatory colouring. But precisely here would seem to lie the weakness of such better influences in high places.   They often produce an illusion of successful results,
* The date of the Reichstag- Peace Resolution -was; July-19, 1017.-when there is in reality only a courtly show of acquiescence. It remains to be seen whether Prince Max, whose obvious task is to meet the realities of the present perilous situation of Germany by new terms of conciliation and by overtures more tactful and carefully-calculated than those of his predecessors, will achieve real success against the Pan-Germans, the Junkers, the big industrialists, and the military party, whose views have, for the present at any rate, been discredited by the march of events in all the theatres of war.If his ultimate offer is inadequate and fails, it is quite on the cards that the. Emperor and his military advisers will once more resume direct control of affairs and will endeavour to rally public opinion to the support of their own methods.6. There is one point in Prince Max&apos;s speech to the Reichstag on Saturday, the 5th October, which demands particular attention. He said that in making his selection of the members of the new Government &quot;I laid the greatest weight on the fact that the members of the new Imperial Government stand on the basis of a just peace, regardless of the war situation, and that they openly declared this to be their standpoint at the time when we stood at the height of our military successes.&quot;Now, as regards Prince Max himself, there is decisive evidence that under the influence of the military situation last February his views of a just peace were funda-mentally different from what they are to-day.Last February he wrote a letter to Prince Alexander Hohenlohe in which the following remarkable passages occur : &quot; As I reject parliamentary institutions for both Germany and Baden, I had to tell the German and the Baden people that I understand their need, but that I do not believe such institutions would bring them any help.&quot; As regards the question of peace, my line is exactly the same.&quot;Even I naturally wish to make as much as possible out of our successes. In contrast to the so-called Peace Resolution (the hateful child of fright and the Berlin dog days*), I want to get as much in the Avay of indemnities as we can in any shape or form, so that the end of the war will not leave us impoverished.&quot; On this point I do not quite agree with you. I still think that it is not necessary to say more about Belgium than has been said already. The enemy know enough already, and Belgium is the only commodity we have to barter with in dealing with an enemy as cunning and wide-awake as England.&quot;
