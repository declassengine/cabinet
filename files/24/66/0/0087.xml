PROPOSED BOMBING REPRISALS FOR $9^7 ACTS OF DEVASTATION.Memorandum from Air Ministry.The proposal put forward by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs C.G.T.,59317, has already in part been considered by the Air ministry in connection with the tactical bombing scheme of the Independent Air Force.The Air Ministry fully agree as to the desirability cf any measures which could be taken to accomplish the end desired by i&apos;r. Balfour and would do everything possible to $arry out the proposals If the practical difficulties could be quickly overcome.These difficulties are as follows :-(1)     To select and publish the 5 towns which are to be subjected to systematic bombing, would forewarn the enemy and enable them to effect a formidable concentration Of anti-aircraft defences in the vicinity of the towns which would militate strongly against the prospect of successful raids.(2)     If it were published that the pilots should not confine their targets to objectives of military importance, the German Government would probably shoot any pilots captured while engaged on operations of this nature, necessitating counter threats on our part and further immediate reprisals.(3)    All Important German towns at present only come within the scope of long range operations, and the weather conditions whioh are likely to prevail for some months to come will subject. punitive raids on objectives at long range to protracted periods of delay.(4)     The part of the British Air Force known as the Independent Force, is the only organised Force in existence which can carry out   long range expeditions into Germany, and even at present its energies are practically devoted to the bombing of German towns, and its efYorts are only.limited by weather, by the strength of the Force, and by the technical limitations of its materiel .(5)    Although the independent Force selects as its target objectives of military Importance, much evidence exists&apos; of the moral effect produced by raids of this character, and the extent of demoralisation caused to the civilian population on account of the factories attacked being situated in, or close to towns of considerable importance.(6)     It is hoped considerably to extend the extent of the bombing operations, into Germany, with a consequent increase in the moral and material effect, by early reinforcement of the existing Force by the addition of not only further British squadrons, but also units of the French, Italian, and American Air Services, in accordance with an agreement now under consideration by the French Government.14.10.18.
