NORTH SEA.Operations (other than Anti-Submarine) carried out by Aircraft during July, 1918.Felixstowe, July 4th.-Four large America Seaplanes, Nos. 4540, 4297, 4513 and 4300, set out on patrol in the vicinity of North Hinder at 0150. At 0220 No. 4300 broke formation, and was seen to steer N. by W. apparently with engine trouble. On the return journey the three remaining machines were attacked from the side and rear by seven hostile aircraft (five monoplane float two-seater machines, and two biplane single-seater scouts). A lively fight ensued, resulting in two hostile aircraft (one monoplane and one single-seater) being driven down out of control. All three of our machines were badly damaged, the casualties being Eng. Hopely, of machine No. 4513, killed ; and Lt. Williams, of No. 4297, Lt. Anderson, of No. 4513, and W/T Operator Hilton wounded. Special mention is made of A.M. 2 W. M. Blacklock (Eng.), of machine No. 4540, who, with total disregard of personal danger, went out into the plane whilst the machine was in flight and, despite heavy fire from enemy machines concentrated on him, stopped up, with his hand, a heavy leak of oil from the crank case of the starboard engine and so enabled the pilot to carry on flying and make a landing, at a point some miles ahead, alongside a fishing smack.Westgate, July 18th. At 0800 two Short Seaplanes from Westgate and two Camel Aeroplanes from Westgate set out on special patrol to Kentish Knock and sunk light vessels. At 0915, when about 4 miles S.E. of Kentish Knock, patrol was attacked by seven hostile aircraft (one large two-seater, and six very fast small single-seater seaplanes). The enemy machines-painted a sea-green colour attacked from the direction of the sun, and consequently were not seen until they were close to our machines.Lt. Vincent, pilot of Camel No. 5601, engaged one enemy single-seater until it fell out of control, spinning straight into the sea.One of the two Short Seaplanes steered for home, while the other landed safely on the water. The enemy two-seater machine concentrated its attention on the Short, which landed, and eventually glided down and made. a good landing beside the Short Seaplane. It would appear that these two machines must have continued fighting on the water, as they were both seen by Kentish Knock to burst into flames shortly after they landed and to be burning fiercely for about three minutes. The other Short, previously mentioned as having broken away from the fight and steered for Westgate, was overtaken by the two Camels about fifteen minutes after the fight, and appeared to be all right. The aeroplanes left the Short Seaplane and returned direct to Manston. Nothing has since been heard of the Short, and it is assumed she must have been hit by enemy fire and forced to land in the sea which was extremely rough and it is probable that she sank in a very short time.Lt. Vincent and Lt. Wagstaff, the pilots of the two Camels, are mentioned as having shown great courage and gallantry, deserving of the highest praise.Raid on Tondern Airship Base, July 19th-A detachment of the Grand Fleet&apos;, including cruisers carrying R.A.F. aeroplanes, carried out an extremely successful bomb attack on Tondern Airship Base on the morning of July 19th.At a point 80 miles from the objective, between 0300 and 0330, two flights of Camel Aeroplanes, consisting of three and four machines respectively, started for. Tondcrn. The three machines of the first flight all appear to have made direct hits upon the northernmost of the two large Zeppelin sheds to the North of Tondern. The shed was set on fire and gutted. Two of the machines failed to return. Of the four machines of the&apos; second flight, the fate of one is uncertain, while three landed in Denmark.The Sylt Seaplanes made no attack on the raiding aeroplanes, possibly because the latter flew in at 9,000 feet and above the clouds. After the raid two seaplanes endeavoured to attack a destroyer, but were driven off by gunfire.
*NO. 5 GROUP, DOVER PATROL.(Overseas Unit.)Generally the weather during the month has not been favourable, as on fourteen days and eighteen nights practically no war flying was possible.No. 210 Squadron, B.R. Camels, was attached to 5th Group as from July 8th, and Capt. (T. Major) E. W. Norton assumed command of No. 204 Squadron from July 27th, vice Captain (T. Major) B. L. Huskisson, D.S.C.Major (T. Lieut.-Col.) C. F. Kilner, D.S.O., assumed command of 82nd Wing from July 28th, vice Major (T. Lieut.-Col.) R. H. Mulock, D.S.O.On the night July 24th/25th the first S.N. 1,600-lb. bomb dropped on active service was released from a Handley Page machine. It functioned successfully, and all lights in the town of Middlekerke went out and A.A. fire stopped and was not renewed. A subsequent photograph showed that the bomb dropped in a field about half a mile East of the town, and the crater caused by the bomb had a diameter of over 50 feet, and the spread of earth displaced covered an area over 100 yards in diameter.RECONNAISSANCE.Photographic W/T and coastal reconnaissances have been somewhat curtailed by the weather. Photographs show that the destroyer which was sunk by a bomb off the Mole has now been salved and taken into Bruges Docks. A new aerodrome also is in use N.E. of Maldeghem, whilst Ghistelles Aerodrome is again active, four large Gotha hangars having been added.BOMBING RAIDS.Objects of military importance and enemy shipping have been attacked with success when conditions have been suitable. Direct hits were obtained on a destroyer, on a ship in dock and a large barge. The first-mentioned was seen to be on fire and the la^t-mentioned was completely destroyed.Units, other than 5th Group, have assisted in the bombing raids.The summary of bombs dropped during these operations is given in pages 5 and 6.Information has been received through agents which must be accepted with reserve that German soldiers state that of their anti-aircraft shells only about 40 per cent, burst.On July 5th unsuccessful efforts were made to destroy the blockships.It is also reported that upwards of 200 marines and 6 officers were killed by bombs during raids carried out in the early part of July. The damage to La Brugeoise Works is estimated at about 1,000,000 marks, and 500 small houses were damaged by the explosions.The lock gate and spare lock gate at Zeebrugge have been&apos;destroyed, and it is said that it will take six months to replace them.A 2Yarmouth, July 31st.-Large America N. 4305 (Pilots: Captain Mossop, Lieut, Hodgson), whilst on patrol, was attacked by five enemy monoplane seaplanes in formation. During the fight which ensued the W/T operator, Pte. Cooper, was killed, and a few minutes later the machine, was hit in the gravity tank and forced to land. Captain Mossop ordered the crew out on to the wings, and the enemy attacked again in line ahead from the rear, and the large America immediately burst into flames. The engineer, Pte. Dingley, disappeared, and it is presumed fell back into the flames arid was killed.The pilots and Pte. Greenwood (G/L) were all in the water, and the latter, whose belt would not inflate and who could not swim, was supported by the two officers for 35 minutes until they were all picked up by a T.B.D.
ENEMY AIRCRAFT.Engagements with enemy aircraft have been above normal, and have resulted in 24 enemy machines being destroyed ; 31 driven down. Total 55.A particularly lively engagement took place when No. 218 Squadron (82nd Wing) was on a bombing raid with Bruges Docks as an objective.The Squadron was intercepted between Ostendc and Bruges by a large number of Phalz and Albatross Scouts and Fokker Biplanes flying in separate formations of eight machines.Two enemy machines were shot down in flames by Capt. Cleghorn (P.) and 2nd Lieut. Potts (0.) ; and Capt. Baskerville (P.) and Sergt. Harris (0.).Another was shot down by Lieut. Fawdry (P.) and 2nd Lieut. Cryan (0.), and was observed to crash into the sea, Three other enemy machines were driven down out of control by Lieut. Hanmer (P.), Sergt. Powell (0.), Lieut. Brumell (P.), G/L Joysey (0.), and Lieut. Rieves (P.) and 2nd Lieut. Worthington (0.).Over 1,500 rounds of ammunition were expended on this occasion.The above Squadron were also attacked on another occasion when returning from a raid by enemy machines. In the ensuing fight Capt. Chisholm (P.), G/L Williams (0.) destroyed one enemy machine,&apos; which crashed into the sea. Lieut. Brading (P.) and G/L Smith (0.) attacked another, which broke up in the air. Two others were shot down out of control by Lieut. Reeves (P.) and 2nd Lieut. Worthington (0.), and Lieut. Anderson (P.) and 2nd Lieut. Swarridge (0.).Whilst on offensive patrol No. 210 Squadron engaged two formations of eleven and four Fokker Biplanes and Phalz Scouts. One Fokker was shot down by Capt. H. T. Mellings and was seen to crash. Five others were shot down out of control by Lieut. Unger, Lieut. Swale (2), Capt. H. G. Mellings and Lieut. Buchanan (jointly) and Capt. Paley.No. 204 Squadron (61st Wing) attacked ten Fokker Biplanes subsequently reinforced by another patrol of ten Fokkers and a Rumpler two-seater. During the ensuing engagement four enemy machines were destroyed and one shot down out of control. Capt. J. E. L. Hunter attacked a Fokker which stalled, and the pilot fell out, and then attacked another, which broke up in the air. Lieut. R. M. Bennett attacked another, following it down to 400 feet, when it crashed and burst into flames; Lieut. Bennett was wounded by machine-gun fire from the ground. Lieut. R. Mcl. Gordon drove one down out of control. We lost three machines.Two patrols of Nos. 204 and 210 Squadrons (61st Wing) attacked eight Fokker Biplanes and Phalz Scouts and a Halberstadt two-seater, of which four were destroyed, and two shot down out of control. Lieut. S. A. Robinson shot down a Fokker, which was observed to crash and burst into flames. Lieut, T. W. Nash shot down a Phalz Scout, which also crashed, and Lieut. Yerex a Halberstadt two-seater, which broke up in the air. Two other Fokkcr Biplanes were shot down out of control by Capt. L. P. Coombes and Lieut. I. C. Sanderson (jointly) and Lieut. K. R. Unger.In addition to the above, other enemy machines have been destroyed or shot down out of control by the following pilots and observers : DestroyedLieut. Fawdry (P.), 2nd Lieut.

On July 3rd, 1918, 2nd Lieut. Lashbrook (Pilot) with Signaller Osborne (Observer) in D.H. 6 No. 9383, while carrying out escort patrol duty with Convoy T.U. 63, observed a torpedo approaching the second ship of starboard wing column from the port side, in position Lat. 54.37 N., Long. 0.50 W., at 1930.The above-mentioned ship was warned of approaching torpedo by continuous firing of Very&apos;s lights and Aldis signal lamp. Observing the signal, the ship altered its course to starboard, thus avoiding contact with the approaching torpedo, which was observed to pass astern of ship. A destroyer in vicinity was also informed by Aldis signal lamp.The aeroplane was patrolling on the starboard side of convoy when tho torpedo was sighted.Seaton Carew, June 30th.-Sopwith Baby Seaplane N. 2067 (Pilot, Lt. Addis), whilst on escort patrol at 2155, sighted the periscope of a submarine proceeding S.E. in position 540 23 N., 0o 05 W. After a Very&apos;s light had been fired, the seaplane proceeded towards the periscope. One 65-lb. bomb was dropped, which fell 6 8 yards ahead, and 4 yards to port of the periscope.. The bomb did not appear to take effect, as the submarine continued on its course and dived. Very&apos;s lights were fired to indicate the position of the submarine to motor launches, who left the convoy and steered for the area indicated by the seaplane, but the submarine had disappeared and was not seen again. The seaplane landed at Scarborough and reported.Newlyn, June 30th.-Short Seaplane No. 2958 (Pilot, Capt. Callaway; Observer, Lieut. Nixon), whilst on patrol at 1925, in position 490 27 N., 60 23&apos; W., sighted a grey shape about four miles distant bearing S.S.E. with a considerable wake and steering N.W. In the slight haze the silhouette resembled a motor boat. Arriving over the spot, the seaplane observed no trace of the craft, which had disappeared when about one mile distant. W/T signals were sent to Base, and all ships, warning them of a submarine in the vicinity. At 1940, when in position 938, the periscope of a submarine, with the conning-tower just below the surface, was observed steering E.N.E. (mag.) beneath the seaplane. One 230-lb. and one 100-lb. bombs were dropped, the first of which exploded about 100 feet ahead and 60 feet to starboard of the periscope ; the second bomb failed to explode. The submarine continued on its course without diving for two or three minutes after the explosion of the bomb, but was then lost to sight owing to choppy sea. Further W/T signals were sent to Base, and the seaplane returned, after patrolling the vicinity for some time, without observing anything further.Fishguard, July 6th-Short Seaplane No. 2830 (Pilot, Lieut. E. A. Eames), whilst on patrol at 1600, sighted the periscope of a submarine cutting through the water about 3 knots in the direction of a convoy which was approximately 8 miles away. A 230-lb. bomb was dropped, which exploded 20 feet right abeam the periscope. Much black sediment was thrown up by the explosion and large quantities of oil and air bubbles rose to the surface. Surface craft was signalled to by Aldis lamp, whereupon they altered course for the position where the explosion had occurred. The seaplane returned to Base owing to shortage of petrol and, therefore, could observe nothing further.*Dunkirk, June 27th. D.H. 4 Aeroplanes A. 7867 and A. 8022 (217 Squad-ron, 61st Wing), whilst on patrol at 0530, sighted a large hostile submarine, fully blown, steering S.W. in position 2 miles 450 from Ostende Piers. Two 230-lb. bombs were dropped, from 800 feet, which burst 20 feet away from the submarine ; two more 230-lb. bombs from 1,000 feet, one of which burst wide of the target and the other 15 feet ahead. The submarine then started to submerge, and the patrol was forced to withdraw owing to heavy A.A. fire from shore batteries.* The details of these attacks were received too late to include in the Report of Naval Air Operations for June.
*Dunkirk, June 29th. Two D.H. 4 Aeroplanes, Nos. 7773 and A. 8013 (217 Squadron, 61st Wing), piloted by Lt. Judge and Lt. Berthe respectively, whilst on patrol at 1930, sighted a long dark object below the surface steering N. by E. in position 400 yards 200o of C. 1 Buoy, East Dyke. The patrol dived from 1,000 feet to 800 feet and dropped four 230-lb. bombs, which fell directly over the objective. A quantity of oil and air bubbles rose to the surface, forming two patches about ten yards wide. Scattered patches of yellow scum were also observed in the area. The aeroplanes returned to report and rebomb, leaving Base again at 2030. Two large oil patches 30 yards in diameter were observed, and a square white object and a piece of spar were seen floating between the oil patches. The yellow scum was no longer visible. Four more 230-lb. bombs were released over the patches, but no further results were observed.Newhaven, July 7th. Short Seaplane 2827 (Pilot, Lt. Ackery; Observer, Lt. B. Dangerfield, M.C.), whilst on patrol, observed the track of a torpedo fired at a merchantman. The torpedo turned when about 100 feet from the vessel and just missed the bows.The seaplane made for the position of the source of the torpedo, and when about half a mile distant a submerged submarine was sighted. The submarine came to the surface, with conning-tower awash, and was apparently unaware of the presence of aircraft for some time. When the submarine dived the seaplane had turned into the wind and the seaplane and submarine were thus approaching one another.One 230-lb. bomb*was dropped, which exploded 50 feet in front and 30 feet to left of the conning-tower. Three seconds after the explosion of the bomb a second upheaval was observed. Oil continued to rise to the surface &quot;for a considerable time. The submarine was about 220 feet long, with a long flush deck, sharp bows, high central conning-tower with steps. It had two periscopes, one much higher than the other; one gun was observed, forward, and it is thought that there was one aft. The hull was painted light grey.Houton Bay, July 7th. Large America Seaplane No. 4230 (Pilots: Capt. Kendall, Lt. Powell), whilst on patrol at 1340, sighted the wash of a submarine in square 72 C, about 7 miles distant on the starboard bow. On further investigation the periscope of a submarine was sighted proceeding N.N.W. at a speed of about 5 or 6 knots.After a short delay two 230-lb. bombs were dropped, one of which exploded well ahead and in line with the submarine, and the other on the track about 50 to 70 yards from the end.W/T signals were sent to Base and the seaplane returned after observing nothing further.Calshot, July 8th. Large America Seaplane No. 4286 (Pilot, Capt. Mumford ; Observer, Lt. Stephenson), whilst on patrol, sighted the periscope and conning-tower of a submarine on the port quarter, about two miles distant, steering E. by S.The seaplane immediately headed for the position of the submarine and on arrival, at 1137, one 230-lb. bomb was dropped on the then totally submerged submarine. The bomb exploded about 30 feet ahead and 10 feet to starboard of the spot where the submarine submerged. P. boats came to the spot and dropped depth charges, and an airship in the vicinity dropped a bomb on the position of the attack, whereupon oil and bubbles rose to the surface.After circling the position for some time the seaplane returned to Base.Killingholme, July 18th. Large America Seaplane No. 4287 (Pilots: Lt. Laurence, Ensign G.S. Hodges), whilst on patrol at 0714, sighted the wake of a submarine. One bomb was dropped after passing over the submarine twice ; bubbles rose from the submarine.* The details of these attacks were received too late to include in the Report of Naval Air Operations for June,
A second bomb was dropped and an oil patch was observed on the surface in the position where the bomb was dropped. On being informed by the seaplane a destroyer came to the position of the submarine and dropped six depth charges. The seaplane left the destroyer patrolling the vicinity and returned to Base.Houton Bay, July 13th. Large America Seaplane No. 4407 (Pilots : Capt. W. Man, Lieut. W. M. Shoosmith), whilst on patrol at 2236, sighted a submarine on the surface in position 590 27&apos; N., 20 19&apos; W., about two miles distant. The submarine was steering West when she was first sighted, but apparently stopped ; a large cloud of steam or smoke was seen to rise from her stern.Two bombs were dropped. The first exploded 30 feet from \he tail of the submarine as the conning-tower submerged, and the second exploded in the centre of the large patch of bubbles left by the submarine on submerging. Ten seconds after the explosion of the second bomb a very violent explosion was heard, which was quite different from the explosion of the bombs. Immediately after this explosion a white patch of bubbles and foam appeared on the surface; this was about 50 yards wide, and quite distinctive from the black patches caused by the explosion of the bombs. The seaplane was violently shaken by the under-water explosion, and the W/T was put out of adjustment; nevertheless, signals were sent to Base reporting attack on submarine, although difficulty was experienced in receiving signals. After circling the vicinity and observing nothing further, the seaplane returned to Base and landed at 2255.Redcar, July 14th-Aeroplane D.H. 4 No. 6881 (Pilot, Lieut.D. Girardot), whilst on patrol at 1220, sighted the periscope of a submarine steering N.E. in position 540 34&apos; N., 0o 37&apos; W. The aeroplane immediately headed for the position, but the periscope disappeared when the machine was 900 yards distant. One 100-lb. bomb was dropped, from 300 feet, over the spot, which exploded 30 feet from the centre of the disturbed water.Surface craft were informed, and a destroyer dropped depth charges in the vicinity.After circling the area for 25 minutes and observing nothing further the aeroplane returned to Base.Houton Bay, July 17th.-Short Seaplane No. 1592 (Pilot, Capt. R. J. Pipon; Observer, Lieut. E. J. Garner), whilst on patrol at 2113, sighted a submarine, fully blown, heading N.W. in position 590 33&apos; N., I0 59&apos; W.The seaplane steered for the submarine, which dived immediately, and on reaching the position dropped two 100-lb. bombs where the submarine submerged. The bombs exploded, but no result was observed.The seaplane was forced to land, and was towed to Kirkwall.Submarine was of medium size, with a round-shaped conning-tower, short periscope and flare bow.Yarmouth, July 17th-Short Seaplane No. 1599 (Pilot, Capt. Grant; Observer, Lieut. Plowman), whilst on patrol, at 1150, sighted a submarine in position 47 R., apparently steering South, six miles distant on the port bow of the seaplane.Course was immediately set for the position, and two 100-lb. bombs were dropped 20 feet on each side of the submerged hull; both bombs failed to explode.Aircraft and surface craft in the vicinity were informed of this attack by flashlight, and after circling the area for some time, the seaplane returned to Base.No further details of the submarine can be given as only the conning-tower was above water.
Killingholme, July 19th. Large America Seaplane No. 4543 (Pilots: Ensign Shiefflin and Lieut. Cutler), whilst on patrol at 1004, sighted a submarine on the surface 25 miles 30o true from Whitby.A bomb was dropped at 1006 which fell 20 feet away from midship of the submarine. After the explosion of the bomb submarine screws were seen to rise and almost break the surface, then disappear. No movement was observed after this, although a careful search was kept up by the seaplane.During the actual attack the submarine was clearly visible. A trawkr in the vicinity proceeded to the scene of action, and the seaplane returned to Base and reported.Killingholme, July 23rd.-Large America Seaplane No. 4156 (Pilot, Ensign B. Lee), whilst on patrol, sighted a submarine steering S. by E. in position 540 16&apos; N., 0o 02&apos; W., on the starboard bow of the seaplane. A recog-nition signal was fired before passing over the submarine, which had completely submerged 30 seconds before the bombs (two 230-lbs.) were dropped. The bombs were observed to explode in a position estimated to be 70 feet from the submerged submarine.The seaplane signalled by Aldis lamp to a destroyer sweeping in front of a South-bound convoy and escorted her about eight miles to the position bombed.The submarine was of small type with a step aft of conning-tower and one gun aft..Seaton Carew, July 26th.-Sopwith Baby Seaplane No. 2067 (Pilot, Lieut. Addis), whilst on patrol at, 1515, observed, at a good distance away, what appeared to be a submarine on the surface. The seaplane altered course, and when about four miles distant was able to confirm that it was a submarine steering S.S.W. with another submarine on the port side apparently steering in the same direction. One Very&apos;s light was fired, to which no answer was given.The nearer submarine submerged, keeping on its course until it was lost sight of. When the first submarine was submerging the after-submarine was plainly visible, although the seaplane was at least a mile away. The number of the submarine was U 77, painted black, with a grey background. A flag was aft which appeared to be all yellow. Only one periscope was visible, which disappeared before conning-tower was submerged.One bomb was dropped at 1535 which exploded 10 yards ahead of conning-tower and two or three yards to starboard of the submarine outline.An attempt was made to attract the attention of a U.T. convoy about eight miles away by the firing of Very&apos;s lights, but the distance was evidently too great for the signalling to be noticed, so that the seaplane altered course for Base and reported.Dundee, July 26th-Short Seaplane No. 1831 (Pilot, Capt. W. R. Kelly; Observer, Capt. G. T. M. McGregor), whilst on patrol at 0700, sighted the distinct wake of a periscope steering S.W. at a distance of 100 yards to starboard of the machine.The seaplane turned and dropped two 100-lb. bombs from a height of about 70 feet. Both bombs landed practically together close to, and just astern of, the periscope.An attempt was made to warn a trawler in the vicinity, but as it was &apos; thought the signals were not understood, the seaplane proceeded about six miles South and communicated with a surface craft by Aldis lamp.The area was searched for some time but nothing further was sighted.Seaton Carew, July 27th-Sopwith Baby Seaplane No. 2107 (Pilot, Lieut. Clutterbuck), whilst on patrol, sighted a ship torpedoed and sunk two miles S.E. of Whitby. At 1650 a periscope was sighted and bombed half a mile N.W. of torpedoed ship. No result was observed. Two destroyers, five motor launches and several drifters were directed to the vicinity and dropped depth charges.

FRENCH NAVAL AIR SERVICE.During the month&apos; of June, 1918, the French Naval Air Service has (excluding Kite Balloons) carried out 3,621 anti-submarine patrols, covering a distance of 447,040 miles. Of this distance 387,940 miles have been flown by seaplanes and aeroplanes, and 59,100 miles by airships.Attacks have been carried out on 11 occasions. Mines have been sighted on 9 occasions.Statistics of the work done in the various areas are given in Tables &quot; D,&quot; &quot; E,&quot; and &quot; F,&quot; pages 15 and 16.The following are particulars of the attacks on enemy submarines : Le Havre, June 6th. In answer to an allo, an emergency patrol set out at 1206. When in position N.N.W. of Havre, a flotilla of fishing boats was sighted, and about 50 metres distant a camouflaged vessel, having a grey hull with a white streak painted from end to end and a black conning-tower, was observed. The machines set course for the craft, which submerged when three miles distant. At 1300 two bombs were dropped on the wake, which was distinctly visible. t The attacked submarine had just emerged 50 metres from a fishing vessel, and fired three rounds at her.A continuous search was kept for three hours with no further result.Bizerte, June 7th. Fighting aeroplanes set out to ascertain the cause of a violent cannonade heard at the Base from a N.-Easterly direction.At 0740 the patrol sighted the Italian brig &quot; Christoforo Colombo&quot; demasted with sails and yards hanging down. The crew had abandoned the ship in two parties, and were observed some distance away, A submarine on the surface was seen approaching the vessel. Course was immediately set for the submarine, which opened fire on the aeroplanes. Four bombs were dropped, one of which fell on the stem of the submarine but failed to explode ; only one ou; of the four bombs exploded. One of the aeroplanes returned to Base for more bombs, while the other kept watch over the submarine, which did not submerge owing to the fact that some of the crew were on the brig. The crew boarded the submarine a few minutes later, after which the brig sank after a violent explosion, probably due to a bomb.The submarine then&apos; steered N.E. at full speed, firing shells at the aero-plane. An hour later the submarine dived, leaving an oily swell on the surface. Nothing more was seen of the submarine, although patrols were sent out in search.Guernsey, June 6th. Whilst on patrol a flight of seaplanes observed a disturbance of the water, and just below the surface a long narrow shadow. It was difficult to observe details owing to the fact that the object was in the sun. A few minutes later a periscope was seen at a distance of 300 metres emerging from the water. Bombs were dropped by the aircraft at 1845. Surface craft were informed by means of a message buoy. As the machines were not fitted with wireless the Base was not informed, but on the return of the patrol, another flight was sent out to search the bombed area, without result.Dunkirk, June 8th.-Two seaplanes from Calais set out on patrol to search for a submarine reported in the vicinity between Sandetti and Goodwin Banks. A wash was observed with what appeared to be a periscope. A bomb was dropped, which appeared to explode very near the target. Nothing further was seen of either the wash or the periscope, and the disturbed condition of the sea did not permit of the observation of the hull of the submarine, if indeed it were a submarine. After remaining in the vicinity for 25 minutes the machines returned to Base.Salonika, June 16th.-Two F.B.A. Seaplanes from Skiatho, whilst on patrol, sighted a periscope 500 metres away. The submarine dived, and a flare was dropped near the position of submerging.
On passing over the spot the submarine was clearly visible, below the* surface, and four bombs were dropped in succession, two of which exploded to the fore of the periscope, which was still visible.A few minutes later a huge upheaval was observed, with enormous air bubbles rising to the surface, for a period of 10 minutes, when the bubbles ceased to rise with such rapidity.Surface craft were informed by means of a message buoy.Patrols searching the area during the day failed to observe anything further of the submarine.Bayonne, June 30th. Two bombs were dropped on the wake of a submarine 10 miles N.W. of St. Sebastien.AIRSHIPS.Baraki, June 4th. Airship A.T. 7, whilst escorting a convoy, observed 10 miles N.W. a suspicious vessel, which, on investigation, proved to be a sub-marine, which dived, leaving behind a distinct wash. One bomb was dropped on the wake left by the submarine. The position was well searched for half an hour, when the airship turned its attention to the escorting of the convoy. A few minutes later the submarine was observed three miles away showing a conning-tower and two periscopes. The airship altered course towards , the position, but on arrival the submarine had disappeared, leaving no trace. At 1745 the submarine was observed 1,500 metres from the airship, in the same position as before. One bomb was dropped on the wash of the submarine as it dived.Airship A.T. 6, which was in the vicinity, joined A.T. 7 in the search, which proved unsuccessful.It is noted that this attack took place on the track of the Gibraltar-Bizerte-Marseilles convoys.Marquise, June 7th.-An airship on patrol sighted, at 0715, 6 miles W., what appeared to be the periscope of a submarine steering N.At 0733 one bomb was dropped which exploded 1012 metres from the dark shadow which was visible below the surface.Nothing further was observed, and the airship returned to Base owing to engine trouble.KITE BALLOONS.Brest, June 8th.-&quot; L&apos;Etoile de 1&apos;Est,&quot; towing a Kite Balloon, set out on patrol at 0315 in the direction of Ras de Sein. The observer of the balloon sighted a sailing vessel being shelled, and 5,000 metres to the W. of the sailing boat was observed a submarine. A low fog which prevailed at the time prevented &quot; L&apos;Etoile de FEst.&quot; seeing either the sailing vessel or the submarine, but, following the direction of the balloon observer, the ship steered for the position of the submarine and opened fire at 7,500 metres. The submarine dived immediately and was not seen again.Table &quot; D.&quot;-SEAPLANES AND AEROPLANES.Area.Zone Armee NordNormandieBretagne LoireGascogne .. Mediterranee Sept.
