(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;B GOVffiOTNT)SECRETWAR CAffllET.G.3?,. 5935AUSTRALIAN WOOL PURO^IASSS.Memorandum by&apos; Mr * A. Chamber lain.Reference War Cabinet 483, Minute 13.The Cabinet will remember that they commissioned me to discuss from time to time with Mr.Summers, as ho might desire, any questions arising out of the Programme Committees,The terms on which we are to sell to America Australian wool is one of these Questions, and apart from this it was specifically referred to me by the Chancellor of the Exchequer some time ago owing to the differences of opinion which had arisen not only between II.M.Government and the Americans, hut also between various British Departments,I have had repeated interviews on the subject with Mr. Summers, Mr.Weir and repj^eeentatives of the Foreign Office, Colonial Office and Board of Trade.    We have come to an agree-ment with the Americans on every point save one - a proposed *-surcharge of 10$ to cover the risks run by the British Govern-ment in guaranteeing the minimum price and in undertaking collateral and&apos; less profitable bargains with Australia.-The War Office, as represented by Mr,Feir, attached great importance to this 10$ and there is much to ^e said for their contention;   but I entirely agree with &apos;    Lord Reading ; 4hat &quot;le jeu ne vaut pas le ohandelle&quot; and that it would be foolish to make bud blood for so trifling a pecuniary advantage, I have already so informed Mr.Weir.    If the matter hue not already been arranged,, this is only aue to my illness and-1 hope that with Lord Readings concurrence 1 m^y be empowered to conclude this bargain here w  ^hout waiting for his return to U.S.A.      It would deotroy my usefulness with Mr.Summers if he felt that he could not get reasonable satisfaction from me, and it would undermine his authority with Mr.Baruch if he reported that the concession would not be made and Mr.Baruch then obtained it from Lord Reading.I need only add thaiJ the Australians are not conoerned in the question of the 10$ though their assent is neoessary to other features of the bargain&apos; to which the War Office have already agreed.I ask therefore that, subject tc Lord Readings concurrence the deeisiam of the War Cabinet recorded in Minute 13, be altered so as to leave the settlement of the wool question to me in tendon next week.(Initialled)   A.0,10th Octote r, 1918.
