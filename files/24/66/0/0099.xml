57/Aircraft/l&apos; ^ Copy No. j 2       t bbi1/:71a ! i OMVS il G R li, T ^ a,ANTIAIRCRAFT EE FEN CE OP THE UNITED KINGDOM1/171/490..1.       In the Air Ministry proposals forwarded t  the V/ar Cabinet on ^   24th August, 1918, 20 Squadrons R.A.F, were allotted for Home Defence? of which 16 are actually in England, 2 in Ireland, and 2 are not yet formed.2.        The Air Ministry propose, (See Appendix &apos;A&apos;) that 5 of those 20 squadrons should be placed in Pranoe in order to cope with enemy night bombing, and the remaining 15 in England. 3.       This will involve a reduction of 1 squadron in England and 2 service squadrons In Ireland.     These latter can bo provided from England if and when required.4.        The Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, British Armies in Prance, has made urgent representations for the provision cf night fighting squadrons, based on the success of the single squadron which was sent &apos;to Prance in June, and which, up to- end of September had accounted for 18 enemy night-bombing machines.The Air Ministry contend, and. I agree, that owing to the present battle situation and the line which the enemy will con-ceivably hold in the near future, the probability of hostile air raids is considerably reduced; and further, that night fighting .   squadrons stationed in France should be regarded as an advanced defence against air raids on England,- as seme of these squadrons will be very favourably situated for intercepting raiding machines both on the out and homeward journeys.5.        I attach a Table (&quot;Appendix !BT) which shews the reductions that-have taken place in the Home Defence Squadrons since hay 1918 to provide for overseas requirements, and also how replacements havo *      been effected..6, The Air Ministry alse propose to reduce the 10 Balloon Aprons new in position to 1 Apron.    Their actual value has never beendefinitely
9 3 0 o a odefinitely proved, but it was hoped that they would prevent bombing from low altitudes, and have a certain moral effect on enemy pilots.The reduction would release some 2,500 personnel, in view of which I concur in the &quot;proposalo7i    The Air ministry also suggest that a proportion of search-lights and sound locators should&apos;be sent to Prance.    These adjuncts are necessary for successful and efficient working) and I consider that 8 lights and 8 sound locators should accom-pany each night fighting squadron.   They can be provided from Home Defence by re-distribution and without materially weakening the organisation as a wholo, having regard to paragraph 4 above, and I recommend that the War Cabinet sanction the proposal08.    A scheme Is being prepared to transfer to France at short notice all machines capable of useful employment in the field, in the event of a general break-up of the enemy&apos;s armies *   As the measure in question might have to be carried out at short notice, I request that it be considered by the War Cabinet, and that, covering authority be given for taking all preliminary measuresc(Signed) Henry Wilson.Col oG .S eGeneral Staff,War Office,   S W,lo 15th October 1918*
appjmjix &quot;a&quot;        air ministry,STRAND,   tf.C.2.      0d9th Octobor, 1918.Sir,With reference to tho attached letter from tho General Officer Commanding 6th Brigade, Royal Air Force, regarding the future organisation of the Squadrons under his command which are operating in Great Britain for the purposes of Home Defence, I am commanded by the Air Council to bring forward, for the information of tho Army Council, tho following propoood alterations in the present organisation of the Royal Air Force Home Dofenco units *2. In view of the heavy casualtioo and material*damage oaused by the enemy bombing of our back areas in Prance, it is considered that the suggestion contained in the attached letter, that five Squadrons of Sopwith Camel Night Fighters should bo sent to Franco at the earliest possible date, is a sound one.It is therefore proposed to send out three more Night Fighter Squadrons, in addition to Nos. 151 and 152 Squadrons, making a total of five, as allowed for in Air Ministry letter No. B.96 (C.A.S.) dated August 1918.  The whole of tho machines and personnel required for tho throe additional Squadrons will be supplied by 6th Brigade, R.A.P., but it Is considered that tho five Squadrons should beIncludedTho Secretary, War Office,Whitehall, S.W.I.
* &quot;1 O r2. *j o* Jincluded in the establishment of twenty Squadrons which havebeen allotted for Home Defence.3, It is further proposed that the machines of the twoBristol Fighter Squadrons now in tho 6th Brigade, R.A.P,, shall be transferred to E.F., as soon as these ma chinos can bo replaced by Snipe machines.4. As soon as these roplacements have taken place, it isproposed that tho 6th Brigade should be formed as follows6 Avr-o Squadrons,9 Sopwith Camel Squadrons (gradually replacedby Snipe Squadrons), 5 Night Fighting Sopwith Gomel Squadrons j_ in Prance .Total:-   20The Sopwith Camel Squadrons operating both in Great Britain and Pranoe will, commencing from January 1919, gradually bo replaced by Sopwith Snipes.In addition to tho fact that the machinos of the two Squadrons of Bristol Fighters will bo a valuable asset to the R.A.F. forces in Prance, It is considered that the reduction of the number of types of machines for Home Defence will greatly simplify the quostions of the training of pilots and mechanics and the finding of drafts for overseas,--    Moreover, it is considered that, owing to the present battlo situation, and the line which the enemy will conceivably hold in the near future, tho probability of hostile air raids is vory considerably reduced.5. It is proposed to supply the reinforcements ofpersonnel required by the five night flying Squadrons in Prance from the nine Sopwith Camel Squadrons in Great Britain.6. The two R.E.8. Squadrons now in Ireland will cease tobe utilised for service purposes.    Any Squadrons that may berequired
required, in Ireland will be supplied direct from 6th Br igade, R,AoFo In England *7.     It is further proposed that the ten existing Balloon Aprons be reduced to one. which should not absorb more than 300 personnelf thus releasing a&apos;very large number of personnel which are urgently required for duty with units overseas.8*     I am also commanded to suggest that a proportion of searchlights * with tho normal proportion of sound locators; etc.. together with the personnel to man thorn, should be transferred to France with each Night Fighter Camel Squadron It is considered that great benefit would accrue fromt he co-oporaticn which would be obtained by keeping intact the various units which havo trained together In the perfecting of aerial night defence.9e     I am further commanded to request that you will kindly forward In due course the opinion of the Amy Council in regard to the above proposals.I am,Sir,Your obedianfrM&amp;ervant, (Sgdo)   Hi MoAnally.
* COPY,Prom :   General Officer Commanding, **** 06th Brigade, Royal Air Force,To :      Tho Secretary,Air Ministry  (P. of A.O.), Strand, W.C.,2.Horse Guards Parade, Whitehall, S.W.1,The policy as regards formation of Night Fighting Squadrons for the B.E.F. is not known, hut the following suggestions aro made with regard to it*It would appear that five Night Fighting Squadrons placed rougr at equi-distont intervals behind the British front would form an Aeroplane Barrage which would practically prevent hostile Night Bombing behind our lines0As regards the formation of these Squadrons, No, 151 is alnead;. overseas, No. 152 is due to proceed overseas on October 22nd, It is now proposed that three additional Night Fighting Squadrons should 1 formed, by the 6th Brigade at bi-monthly Intervals, i.e, one Squadron to proceed overseas about December 20th, one about Februar; 2oth, 1919, and one about April 20th, 1919,As regards the resources and capabilities of tho 6th Brigade fc supplying these Squadrons in so far as Officers and other ranks are concerned, the following shows the present position of the equipment of 6th Brigade Squadrons With machines and consequently the facilities for training Pilots and mechanics on this type machine :--7 Avro Service Squadrons,7 Samol    do. do,2 Bristol Fighter Service Squadrons,5 Avro Night Training Squadrons.5 &quot;All through&quot; Avro and Camel Night Training Squadrons.It would be desirable for the two Bristol Fighter Squadrons to changed to Sopwith Camel (110 Lc Rhone), if the supply of the machi: admits, in order to simplify questions of Pilot and Mechanic Traini; and draft finding;   but. even should this not be possible, if bhe establishment of the remaining Service and Night Training Squadrons is kept up, or approximately Kept up wiah the type of machines as given above, there should be little difficulty in providing the Officers and other ranks required for the formation of the Night Fighting Squadrons, nor in making good the wastage of pilots with those S/quadrons.As however, the training of Night Fighting Camel Pilots is a difficult and lengthy one, it is essential that if It is decided tt raise and equip three additional Night Fighting Camel Squadrons for overseas, and to maintain a total of 5 Squadrons In Prance, that provision be made for the upkeep of all Squadrons in this Brigade equipped with Camel machines, and, if possible, the re-equipping of the two Bristol Fighter Squadrons with this type of machine as suggested abeve.The position&apos;as regards supply of Sopwith Camels and 110 La Rhc engines Is not known, but if the proposals are concurred in, it would appear that provision would have to be mado as shown by attached schedules.In anticipation of the fact that a total of five Hi At Flghtin Squadrons would be required overseas by next Spring, for the past t months the training of Night Fighting pilots in the 6th Brigade has been carried out on this assumption, and with this end in view.It would, however, greatly assist training in the 6th Brigade consequently draft finding if the future policy of Night Fighting
2 oSquadrons for tho EoFi, could bo definitely laid down*It should be noted that all pupils who aro found unsuitable for Wight Fighting on Scouts   but who have the necessary qualities of determination to warrant them training as Light Night Bombing Pilots, receive training with the four FoE.2*bo   -Night Training Squadrons of tho 6th Brigade t   At present about forty fully trained Light Night Bombing Pilots and 35 Observers are sent to B*EcF. monthlyo(Signed) T*C*R* Higgiris?
