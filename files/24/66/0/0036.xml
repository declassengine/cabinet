The Board have obtained special reports on damage oaused to the wheat orop by the continued wet weather.    Sprouting appears to have taken place to any extent only in Berwick and Boxbiirgh, but a good deal .of loss has been oaused in Porfar, 2ast:Perth, Fife and -the  othlans through shaking out of grain.   The loss of grain or diminution in, the yield of sound grain is generally put at 4 bushels per acre or 10 per owt. of the total yield.      Xn several other districts, however, no damage has been caused.In last weekra report it was stated thatia Compulsory Order had boon issued authorising the proprietor to terminate the tenancy of Cllnter;ty Eton, Auohmedden Bstate, Aberdeenshire. In place of this an amended Order has einoe been issued whereby the Board themselves determined the tenancy.&apos; 2v Supply ofnLabour.On tie urgent representations of the Agricultural Executive-CoEDEnittees for Aberdeenshire, the Board strongly preyed for the temporary release for harvest work of skilled agricultural workers in training at Aber^eenv and this conoeB-:sion has now been granted by the Military Authorities.    The number of men,released is, 00, and it ie hoped that this  . addition to the labour resources of the county will help farmers in their present difficulties.&apos; . &apos;It has.been aanounoed that 2,500 ploughmen will be released from the Army for -tho work of Autumn cultivation, and the Ministry of National Service are now making the^necessary arrangements for their employment... - &quot;3.   3ale of Horses Order. ,During the week 821 lioenoes,for the sale*of agrioul-:tural horses were Issued to farmers.    0?he total number of licences issued to date is 39,606.        - &apos;*- V-. ...4.1&apos;:. fonrplff of goal for Threshi^ and other A^ioultiiralNumerous applications are being received daily, through the Distriot Agricultural Exeoutive Committees from farmers who are unable to obtain tneir usual supplies for threshing , , and baling purposes. *&apos;.vA similar difficulty is be*irig experienced by blaoksmiths in procuring smithy coal.   The Board&quot; are in1 sotDmunioation on the subject with the District Ooal and Ooke Supplies / ,,-
Supplies Committee for Scotland, and are endeavouring to obtain special consideration for these oases.6.   Supply of, fertilisers. M    Muriato of Potash,&apos;The Board have made arrangements for tho supply to makers of Compound Fertilisers in Scotland of a limited quantity of Mtzriate of Potash from the factory of the British Potash Company, limited, Oldbury.    Applicants must guarantee that the potash will be used solely in the manufacture of;Potato or flax fertilisers and not resold in any other form.In addition to the quantity of Muriate of Potash to be -sold to makers of Compound fertilisers a limited quantity (estimated at about 180 tons for the season) will be supplied to farmers for direct application to the land.    Arrangements in connection jsltb; applications by farmers have not yet been oom-jpleted.(h)  Lime, for A^lqultural Purposes.Croat difficulty has been experienced for some time past in maintaining the output of lime for agricultural purposes. Hitherto the chief obstacle has been the shortage of labour, but it is feared that the ourtailmsnt of coal supplies, will create additional difficulties.The Board have made enquiries with a view to finding additional sources of supply and have directed the attention of farmers to the subsidiary sources of lime available in the-quantities of waste carbonate of lime that can be obtained, often for the cost of carting or tailing, from paper and other works in Scotland,    A leaflet explaining the composition and method of use of this matorial has been widely distributed,6.  Wages of A^ioultural fforleers.(a) tThe Board havo issued a Regulation authorising the extension for a further period of 3 months after 23rd October of the time within which District Wages &apos;Committe.*s may fix minimum rates of wages.(b) To the list of District Wages Committees whioh have so far fixed minimum rates of wages for certain classes of workmen, there falls to be added two more, via:-Border Counties (Number 7),-   The Committee for this area have fixed a minimum rate applicable to. ploughmen (both married and single) over l&amp; years of age at 35/- per week of 64 hours between March and October and 48 hours for the remainder of tho year.fife and Kinross (Number 5),The Committee have fixed the following minimum rates for the district
30/- &quot;    &quot;    w male workers &quot;    M    &quot;17/- n    &quot;    11 female workers &quot;  16    w10/- n    w    n girxs between     14 and 16 years10/. www boys     * w    w    it    nSO/- &quot;    &quot;    &quot;       n       * 16   &quot;  18    &quot;7. *gha Testing of Seeds Order 1910.The number of samples reoedved at the Boards Seed Testing Station to date is 1314. and of those 78 are cereals. The testing of cereals in accordance wiiih the provlaions of the Order presents a difficulty inasmuch as such seed is often sold immediately after threshing, and it is not possible therefore for the seller to have a sample tested and the relative partlo-:ulars famished to his customer beforo the, date of sale or delivery.    To meet this difficulty a Oenoral Licence has been issued Jointly by the three Departments of Agriculture in the United Kingdom authorising farmers and merchants to sell Cereal seed without declaring the particulars racuired by the Order at the time of sale or delivery provided these particulars are supplied within-one month of such sale or delivery.    The torms of this licence have been communicated to the Press and to seed merchants throughout Scotland.   The licence removes a practical difficulty without impairing the effectiveness of the Order as a means of securing that seed grain of approved quality only will be placed on the market.The Board have also prepared a leaflet dealing with the mitt provisions ef the Order with partioulaMfeference to effect or the O^de^^r-th^i^^tdoa^ of forcers in the seed market.
