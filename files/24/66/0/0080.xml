fgjSIb SOOuTIENT IS THE PROPERTY OE HIo BRIMNIC I-.uVJliYTS GOVEiTNlfENffU SECRET.G, (P.5980.!AIi OA 3 I IT E T, CONDITIONS OP ARlilSTIOE,Note by Lord. Curzon-There seems to be some danger that we may confuse (A) the conditions laid down by President &quot;&quot;ilson and ostensibly accepted by the German Government as preliminary to the consideration of an armistioe; fB) the conditions of the armistice itself; (0) the conditions that will be reserved for discussion at the Peace Conference.     Germany is endeavouring to treat (A) as identical with (B); some persons are found to orgue as though (B) were a purely military question, the political issues having already been settled by Germany^ acceptance of (A); we have to be particularly on our guard that questions which might, and ought to be included in (B) are not, in the universal weariness of war and desire for a settlement, relegated to (0), when the Allied Powers may have lost either the power or the inclination to enforce them.It will be for President Wilson to say whether he is satis-fied with the reply of the German Government as to the conditions essential, not to the conclusion, but to the mere consideration of an armisticet   I am not one of those who think that, whether his action has been well advised or ill-advised; we have either already been, or are likely to be, dangerously compromised.   Indeed I assume that&apos;tso cannot possibly accept the German reply as satisfactory.       (Ho has since acted in this sense),But whether he does or not, the next stage after will rest not with him, as the spokesman of one of the Allies, tut with all the Allies, America included,, and it is at this stage that the import-ance of being clear in our own minds is paramount.     If it is admitted,&apos; as I think it must be3 that once an armistice has been concluded, the resumption of hostilities will be well-nigh impossible, then is it not also clear that the armistice must contain the conditions of Allied victory: and the victory is not less a victory, and ought not to be robbed of the rewards or consequenoes of victory,, because it has been the result of voluntary capitulation rather than of final disaster in the fieldo The armistice must- in fact satisfy a double criterion.    It must not ftave the enemy army in a position where he can retire intact, to hokd a narrower and more powerful front, and where he can claim that his forces having been voluntarily withdrawn - and his territories being uninvaded, he has in reality been successful in his object and has saved his country from those who made the war in order to destroy it6     Corresponding considerations apply as regards his Navy,   In other words,;, the armistice must itself contain the evidence both to Germany and to the world, of Germany^ defeat.     And secondly, it must contain the guarantees which will both preserve him from renewing the struggle and give to the subsequent Peace Conference the reserve weapons that will enable ,thera to enforce their ultimate decisions. ,If
ButThe surrender Intact of all railway rolling stock permanent way, railway stores an well an waterway and NAVAL. canal craft in tho oocupiod territories.(1)    Cessation of submarine warfare.Surely this is not nearly enough?    I see that the Military and Naval Representatives at Versailles urged the internment of 60 enemy submarines during the armistice,     Ought not the entire submarine fleet of Germany and Austria to be surrendered?(ii) Withdrawal of enemy shipa to specified bases.(iii) Surrender of Heliogoland,(iv) Ought not the Allied Fleet to be admitted at once to the Baltic?    (Just as in the case of an armistice with Turkey, one of the first conditions is the opening of the Black Sea.)(v) la no provision to be made with regard to the&quot;I German Fleet?    Are we to leave it intact for a &apos; conceivable resumption of hostilities?   Why shouldthe German loi^ttbe less recognised on sea than onland?(vi) Replacement of shipping losses and surrender of. - portion of German Mercantile Marine.POLITICAL.By this I mean the insistence upon securities (whether they be military or naval in character) for the final carrying out of the following oft declared purposes of the Allies:-(i) Compensation to Belgium for the irreparable injury inflicted upon her, and funds for her material restoration.(ii) Reparation &quot;or all the overrun countries for their oruel and wanton spoliation.(iii) Indemnities to all or any of the Allied flowers for the colossal expenditure enforced upon them.(iv) Trial and punishment of the principal criminals.It may be that the German people will save us the trouble of dealing with the Kaiser and his family by sending them into a retirement that would be almost as great a retribution as death itself.   % But I cannot see why we should &quot;be frightened at the idea of an International Tribunal, to whom it should be one of the conditions-of an armistice or of peace that certain specified and nOjJpripus German nalefaotore should be surrendered for&quot; trial. There ie/analogy between such a demand and that made by Austria upon Serbia before the outbreak of war, for the surrender for trial of a number of unnamed Serbian Officers whia were supposed or alleged by Austria to have been privy to the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand,     That was a politioal move and a piece of brutal terrorism.     This would be the punishment of incontestable and unprovaked crime,I need not here discuss the subjects that must be postponed to the Peace Conference.      But it is obvious that these will include the fate of the German Colonies, the reeonstitution of Europe and the Near East, the setting up of a League of Nations and a great variety of subjects with which an armistice has nothing to do.
If I\ am right in thoco promiQOd, may we not claooify tho conditi^no ,in*(A), (D) and (c) of my opening paragraph as follows:- ]Conditions opecified in President Wilson&apos;o speeches and al-ready nominally accepted by Germany as antecedent even to the con-siderationo of an armistice,Evacuation by the enemy armies of all occupied terri-toriec, i.e. Belgium, France, Italy, Serbia. Montenegro, Russia, (including the Caucasus), Roumania. (I assume that a corollary and sequel of evacuation will be the immediate reinstatement of the civil population),(ii) Evacuation by the enemy and ultimate retrocession of Alsace Lorraine to Franco and of the Trentino and other regions to Italy,(iii) Emancipation of the subject peoples of the Auotro-Hungarian Empire.(iv) Creation of an independent Poland with access to the Sea.(v) To these have oince boon added the cessation of illegal and inhuman practices by land and sea.I do not allude to the Turkish provisions because so far the German Government does not appear to bo acting for its Ottoman ally.     Neither need I here refer to the general pro-positions of pious import, about Freedom of the Seas, League of Nations, Economic Policy, ReotDl^tlon of Armaments, etcf, because they have no relation, to the conclusion Of an armistice, ab this moment;   nor to his stipulations about the character cf the German Government, a matter in which the President is so far acting on his own&apos;account,Conditions which the Allied Powers, whether they opeak through the mouth cf Marshal Foch or not, should demand as essential to the conclusion of an armistice,     Ought not these to be both military, naval, and political?MILITARY,   (i)   In addition to the retirement of the enemy armiesalready provided for under A. the following have been cr may be suggested:(ii) Disarmament, partial or entire^ of the retreating armies.Surrender of all arms, artillery, munitions and supplies in the areas between the battle front and the Rhinef(iv) Military occupation of bidge-heado on tho Rhine.(v) Military occupation of fortified German citieo. In this connection the occupation of Motz. Strasbourg., or Lille would surely be inadequate; for they are. a portion of the territory which Germany is already committed under (a) to evacuate; and their occupation by the Allied armies now Would be merely an anticipation cf the future,     Ought not some evidence to be given by the occupation of a purely German town; or towns, that the soil is no longer inviolate, and that the Allies have triumphed?(vi) Immediate return of all priooners cf v/ar, military cr Naval.(iii)(vii) Should wo not add to tho above acme ouch conditions as the following:-
\But I repeat that the Conference vill net he able to enforce its decisions unless the Allied Governments have pro-vided.themselves with powerful and adequate securities in advance, and those, securities can only &quot;be obtained either by continuing to fight until the enemy is beaten to his knees, or by an armistice, the terms of which are tantamount to the same result, That is why it is of such supreme importanceto see that in respect of the armistice we make no mistakes.   -(intd.)
