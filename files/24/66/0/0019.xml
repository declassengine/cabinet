Secretary has put &quot;before them I GoTc    with reference to the enforcement of Consoription upon Irelandcd 59180 rSince I was appointed byHis Majestyls Government to tho Viceroyalty of Ire]and I have heoh in close contact with most parts of the country,,     I f recently visit my Irish Home, which  &apos; is situated in one of the most disturbed districts in the West, and I have had ample means of gauging the feeling of the peopleuMy olaim to this knowledge is based also on the fact thatI have lived a good deal in Ireland, and amongst Irish people,which gives me some ground for feeling confident in the probable a6curacy of my judgment.I do not for one moment believe that &quot;fear of bullets&quot; is any greater deterrent to Irishmen then ts any other nationality; in fact, anticipation of danger is not one of the weaknesses of the IrishoTheir race, however, has one very marked characteristic^They are peculiarly liable to be influenced by their im-mediate environment0     Place them in suitable surroundings and they are just as easily roused into imperial enthusiasm as, in the contrary case, they are filled with hatred and angpr by a few crafty sedition-mongers or young priestly fanatics, amongst whom alone they live,free them from the terrorism of the few self-seeking hot-heads and the majority of them would make excellent soldiers,I am of opinion that the view taken by the Chief Secretary as to the prevalent feeling of apprehension is.open to much question,,     Such a feeling, in my experience, is by no means pre-valentoIt is, of course, the great object of the Catholics and the extreme Nationalist Tarty in Ireland to exploit those ideas/ and it is chiefly from such sources that they emanate.I do not agree with the Chief Secretary in his views as to tho attitude of the Police.     There would, doubtless, bo a few &quot;defections&quot;, but they would not materially COffeet tho prac-tical efficiency of the Police force 0...   L marked change has manifested itself during the last four months in tho attitude of tho Royal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin Metropolitan Police.     A much better feeling has been en-gendered, largely owing to a just consideration of their claims as to pay, &amp;oe, and also in a grout measure to tho confidence they now feel that the Government will support them In tho proper execution of their duty,UiS
I pCjIAs Viceroy of Ireland and a member of the &quot;War Cabinet, I would earnestly bog His Liajesty rs Qovornment to continue firmly in tho course they laid down at tho   (opening, of tho Recruiting Campaign, some four months ago,   X regard any deviation from this path, unless it bo warrantod &quot;by a change in war conditions, as fatal to tho future welfare of this country, as an important part of tho British Empire0I believe it is now generally understood that there never has been any pledge made in Parliament or elsewhere, that the enforcement of Conscription shall depend upon the adoption of some form of ilomo Eulewi In my opinion every day   that has passed since I beoameVicoroy of Ireland has proved more cleanly the unfitness of Ireland ,  for any form of Homo Rule, now, or In the immediate future.Seditious ideas and a tendency to a secret alliance with our enemies has oaten .deeply i-&apos;.vO tho heart of the people.   These sentiments must undergo a radical change before the people in tho South and West of Ireland can, in my opinion, be entrusted with soIf-gcvornment0(Signed) FfiEHQSa8th October, 1918*
