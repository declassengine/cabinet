Cecil to I&quot;. piohpn covoring a draft memorandumDear li. pichon,In reference to the Affairs of Syria of which you spoke to me to-day, I have great pleasure in sending you the annexed memorandum to which the Prime minister agrees.   It has not yet been approved by the Cabinet and until that has taken place it must toe treated as to that extent provisional.Yours very sincerely,(Intd.) R. C.DRAFT   &quot;,M10RAEDU!.i.BRITISH EMBASSY, PARIS. October 8th, 1918.Kis Majesty Vs&quot;Government are prepared to accept the arrangement reached at the Conference held at the Foreign Office on the 30th day cf September   upon the understanding that it is to be treated solely as providing for the situation caused &quot;by the recent advance of General AllenbyTs force into Syria and is to be deemed to refer only tv the territories occupied, or to be occupied, by that force.With regard fro the future government of the other territories mentioned in the Anglo-Frenoh Convention of 1916, His Majesty&apos;s Government think it right to point out that the general position has so much changed since that Agreement was entered into that its provisions cU. not in all respects appear suitable to present conditions.   Not only has the military position in Mesopotamia, Palestine and Syria completely altered but two political changes of vast importance have taken place.   The United States have come into the war and Russia has. g.ne out.   It is manifest on the one hand&apos;that Amerioa cannot be ignored in any settlement of the future of these countries and particularly of Syria and Palestine,   And on the other the arrangements contemplated for the North Eastern part of Armenia have been completely upset by the collapse of Russia,   A further difficulty is oaused by Clause 9 of the Treaty of London which recognizes the claims of Italy in connection with the Eastern Mediterranean,   Theprovisional suggestions made at Saint-Jean de liaurienne for meeting these claims have lapsed and indeed w.uld in any case be difficult now to enforce1 vdthout protests from Greece and even from Turkey.While
&apos;;/hile calling attention to these p..into His Kaje&apos;sty*s Government feel that it would &quot;be useless to attempt a settle-mcnt ...f them at the present moment and they suggest that they sh uld form the subject of fresh c nvorsati^ns in wMpft the Governments of Italy and the United States as well as the French and British Governments should be invited t-u take part.(Signed)   ROBERT CECIL.2, Y/hitehall Gar dens,,; S 12th October, 1918.
