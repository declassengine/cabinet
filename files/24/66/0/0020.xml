His Britannic M.ijostys uoygrnn proposed Inquiry into Profits in relation to Cost ofc-^v        ^.^^1^!:....... 84*/n T Memorandum by the President of tho Board?! U. i i 6^5ao &quot;      Trade.Tn the oourse of the campaign to increase coal pro-duo ti on, I have been greatly struck with the intensity of .. the dissatisfaction of the miners whom I have met with the; continued prevalence of what is vaguely described as &quot;profiteering&quot;.     The same doling undoubtedly prevails very widely in labour circles, and it is I believe largely respon-sible for the quite alarming labour unrest of the last few xaonths.    There is an insistent domand for Government action in regard to this abuse.    Examples of luxurious expenditure and of huge dividends distributed are freely quoted, and it is the general belief that excessive profits are being made out of the war, whether by producers or distributors, and that the abstraction of these profits is largely respon-eible for the great and continued rise in the price of necessaries.I am disposed therefore to think that there is good ground for the appointment of an impartial Commission of Inquiry to consider and report upon this matter.In 1916 the Board of Trade appointed a Committee to investigate the principal causes which have led to the in-crease of prices of commodities of general consumption sinoo the beginning of the war.    The Committee does not appear to have givem very much attention to the subject of profit and&apos; profiteering, and their report brings the matter down to the end of 1916 only.    Since then so much has happened, both as regards the increased scope sad stringency of Government  &apos; control and tho increased shortage of supplies, that the tim* mma ripe for a further inquiry.Of course it is well known te those responsible for administering Government contrele that a great part of the ^ntooQd profits which appeal  so vividly to the workmen8 s ? imagination are, in fact, the product pf conditions which  -a garnet be changed except by the socialising of all the means of production or- the  station of huge trusts, being the   ?! direct result of the fact that private controlled&apos;establish-ments are working under a groat variety of conditions of soale m&amp; efficiency and consequently the price level that brings a bare subsistisnoo to one yields a rich harvest to another. Tho only remedy for this form of profiteering (if it can bo  .-. so called) lies obviously with the Chancellor of the S&amp;oheuuer and it has little relation to the srice of necessaries    sinc&amp; ex hypothesi, the price level is as low as it oan U fixed in * order to secure an equate supply,      But.thia point, which ii by no means generally understood, n&amp;ods to bs brought ^ out by an impartial investigation, whioh would also dot ermine whether there re mine anu substantial element of profiteering sshioh does affect prices,
It is possibly in regard to the foods of loss &quot;importance vMch are not under price control, clothes aid othsr noco^w^ vxiQQ that tho need for an inquiry is greatest;    but oven with Government controlled goods there is probably room for investigation to discover whether at any stage there is an enhanced price beyond that justified by the necessary ser-vice rendered. Also no doubt it may be suggestedthat -remedial measures mi git be difficult, especially as further Government control will hardly bo feasible.    Uever* thelesa, the fact of the investigation being set on foot, the knowledge gained from it, add tho publication of its results, would I think Justify tho stop proposed, and it would certainly mako it easier to obtain a practical response to appeals made to workmen for further sacrifices and exertions.If an inquiry is agreed to&apos; in principle, I would suggost tho following terms of reference:-&quot;rJ!o consider and report to what extent end in what respects if aiy the cost of living of the people is being enhanced by the excessive profits of businesses engaged either in production or distribution&quot;.A.H. STANLEY., of Trade,ith October, 1916*
