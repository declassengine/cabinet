document is the Property offii Idy, REPUCTION OF HOURS OF SURffAOS J.V0?ORSkemorandum by the President of the Board of irade.I submit for the decision cf the War Cabinet a memorandum by the Coal Controller on the question of a demand for a shorter working day for certain grades of employees in the South Wales coalfields.    This demand has been considered by the Coal Owners and refused on the grounds  that it is a violation of an agreement between the owners and the men!s Unions and that, if oonoeded, it would result in a reduced output of coal unless more men are employed.    I hare consulted the Minister of National Service, Minister of labour, Sir Stephenson Kent, (Ministry of Munitions) and the Coal Controller, and it is suggested that the Coal Controller should undertake on behalf of the Government to secure for the grades affected an 8j hour day immediately after the v/ar.    The Coal Controller hopes that if this pledge is given it will be accepted by the men and a strike averted, whiifih I am advised will ensue unless an agreement is reached.i Ootober, 1918. A.H.

iffiOT^Bim by owmum of goal muss.Certain classes of surface- workers at tho South Mes coal nines mainly tho mechanical staff a, aro doaandin/ a reduction in&apos;hours. 9At present,, the mxpsm hours treated by those men ereS ft^JlSS1^170 oiJ* h07fJ0T ^altimo, but a number of then work less.   Sone of them, perhaps about one-third are members of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, and the Federation on their bohalf demand that their hours be reduced toBfr hours inclusive of SO minutos mealtime. Tho remainder belong to a craftsmen^ association, not affiliated to the Federation, and this association is demanding: on behalf&apos;of its members 8 hours, inclusive of oj minutos mealtime.   There are *0,so soricus indications of restlessness on this point amongst the surface-workers xn other coalfields, in particular, Nottinghamshire, where a demand for an 8 hours day on the surface has recently boon refused by an arbitrator ap ointed by tho Minister of Labour on the ground that it is a post-war question; a refusal which&apos;L:s caused discontont and is likely to lead to trouble.Similarly, in Scotland, surface-workers are expected within tho next fow days to make a demand upon the&apos; owners for an 8 hours day. and tho underground firemen (officials) in Scotland are also demanding an 8 hours day.The application of the tfouth Wales uiners&apos; federation which ha3&apos;D.een rejected by the owners  is complicated by the fact that, if successfully pressed, it would involve a breach of the Conciliation Board Agreement of 2nd Soptember, 191$ which was negotiated by Ministers of the Crown.     trtWith regard however, to all these applications&apos;if they are bona fide applications for reductions of hours, it is physically impossible to concd::.   thorn&quot; at the present time because of the shortage &quot;of labour, and in particular skilled mechanical craftsmen.If on tho other hand they are really disguised applications for increases of wages as in some cases, at any rate, I believe them to bo, thon they equally deserve to be resisted because the rise m the cost of living is adequately met by the War Wages which have &quot;been granted,TChe serious aseect of these demands is, that once one of them is conceded the-agitation mll1 spread throughout the rest of the coalfields of the country and tho demands will have to be conceded everywhere.   But as regards the members of the mochanical staffs, who are the men principallyas well.14th October, 1918.
