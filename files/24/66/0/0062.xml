f^^/w^    fThig Doc&quot;ment &apos;s the Property ofSECRET. 3.2th October, 1918.  9()9- &apos;   \C0HMAHD OP ALLIED NAVAL FORCE IH THE AEGEAN.1&apos; Admiralty Memorandum for War Cabinet.The question of the command of the Naval Forces in the Aegean is such as to require Immediate action.     If allowed to drift we may find ourselves seriously compromised with our Allies and in a state of uncertainty when the time arrives for action to be taken.The Cabinet will recollect that the Admiralty have always been of opinion that there are sufficient Allied heavy forces in the Mediterranean to cope with the situation if they were disposed in a proper manner. Political considerations, however, have made It impossible to come to a satisfactory understanding with our allies.The Admiralty have put forward a proposal for a British Atlmiralissimo, but the negotiations on this subject have been constantly hampered by difficulties raised by both the French and the Italians in spite of their protestations of agreement.   The Ambassador in Romp is even now negotiating on this question, but his last letter on the subject shows that there is but little hope of a satidfactory conclusion.The Case as it stands at present is as follows:-The French Admiral, Gauchet, is Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean forces, exclusive of the Adriatic. The British Commander-in-Chief at Malta is, however, in charge of all antl-submar-ine operations and of the protection of all routes etc.   The Aegean Is, and always has been, a British Zone, and at Lemnos we have a British -Rear-Admiral In charge of the zone generally and of all minor operations therein.   When the threat of the Black Sea Fleet became more prominent, the French Admiralty sent six pre-Dreadnought French Battleships up- to Lemnos where previously there had been only two British.   A French Vice-Admiral was in command of these ships, and since he was senior to our Rcar-Admiral, It was understood that he would bo In command of the heavy forces should the Black Sea Fleet make a sudden sortie.   This arrangement, though clumsy, was the most satisfactory that could be come to at the time, and it was hoped that had we been able to get the question of a British Admiralissimo satisfactorily settled, the matter would have, been left in the latter&apos;s hands.The situation, however, has now changed.   The oper-ations which are about to be put in force against the Turks require close Naval co-operation, and this co-operation may be divided into two parts, namely,(1)      The landing of troops and stores, etc., at subsidiarybases between Salonika and Gallipoli, and. the protection thereof.(2)      The eventual passage of the Fleet through the Prrdaneliesinto the Marmora, the occupation of Constantinople, and eventually defeating the Black Sea Fleet.As regards No.l there is no question but that it will be in British hands.   Not only are our Allies pleased that all the spade work should be dibne by us, but the only forces there capable of doing the work are British.   In order to make the present situatioWiflear, the British Commander in Chief has been sent to those waters from Malta, and since he is senior to the French Admiral at Lemnos, tho arrangement for the time being at any rate is fairly satisfactory, and it Is not expected that the question of command will again arise until the time comes for the movement
9 A 9 fa U dof the heavy forces.At a Conference of Naval representativea of the Allies at Versailles on the 10th October the question of this command was rais d, and, acting under my instructions, Admiral Hope proposed that the same arrangements should be come to as regards the Naval forces as has been with the military; that is to say, that all operations should be under a British Admiral, who would act generally under the command of tho French Commander-in-Chief.        The French objected, the Italians supported U3, and the Americans had nothing to say as the matter did not concern them.It will bo seen how impossible, and even dangerous the results of this situation may become.There are several reasons both practical and sentimental why the command of these Allied forces should be in British hands.Great Britain made the greatest sacrifices and undertook,the greatest responsibility in the Dardanelles operations and the Gallipoli campaign of 1915,A British Admiral was in command of the Dardanelles Naval operations, and later of, the Naval portion of the combined Gallipoli campaign,        This did not, and will not in the future, conflict with the arrangement come to with France by which a French Admiral is in supreme command of the Allied Navies in the Mediterranean,,The principal enemy naval force in the Mediterranean is still, as in 1915, the Austrian Fleet, and to defeat this Fleet is still the primary objective of the Allied C, in, C It appears only natural that naval operations in waters remote from the Austrian Fleet, such as the Aegean, should be entrusted to a British Admiral under the supreme direction of the Allied Commander-in-Chief,&quot;The Army destined for the land operations against Turkey in Europe is mainly 3ritish, and Is commanded by a British General, under the supreme authority of the French General Officer Commanding-in-Chief.        The naval forces to operate against Turkey will also be mainly British, and by analogy it surely follows that the naval command should be given to a British Admiral under the supreme authority of the French Commander-in-Chief,Close co-operation between Army and Navy i3 of vital importance for the success of combined operations, such as will be those against Turkey.       To ensure the closest co-operation it is ossential that tho General and Admiral in command should be of the same nationality.        To entrust the control ashore and afloat to Officers of different nations is to place an obstacle in the way of success.The Naval force to be employed will consist ofDreadnought battleships of which 100$ will probably be British.Other fighting ships 60%   ..        ..       *, &apos;Small craft, minesweepers,etc..... 100%&apos;   ..Aircraft carriers 100$ Auxiliaries, Colliers,etc..... $Ofo   ..* * * * * *so/
so that of&apos; tne grand total of craft to be employed, excluding Auxiliaries, it is probable that about 75$ will be British. This fact alone constitutes, an almost unanswerable argument in favour of the command being in British hands.The Aegean is, and always has been throughout the War, a British zonec     A British Admiral has always been in command on this zone, under the general orders of the Allied Commander-in-Chief.    It. is not apparent what . arguments can now be brought forward in support of a change in this system which has worked well in the past,MudroBj on which the Naval forces will.be based, was established, and has been maintained, by Great Britain,If the command at sea in these waters were put into tne hands of an Admiral of any -nationality other than British, it would be possible for an unihstructed public to say that the Gallipoli operations of 1915 having failed under British command, it had been found necessary to entrust the duty to another nation0The whole v/ar against Turkey has been carried out almost entirely by Great Britaint   Firstly in the Dardanelles and Gallipoli. secondly in Egypt, thirdly in Mesopotamia, and lastly in Palestine.,    It is therefore only logical that the forthcoming campaign against Turkey should also be carried out by Great Britain,Finally, it is dm no boastful spirit that I affirm thP&quot;. it may confidently be expected that such operations are far more likely to be brought to a successful issue under the command of a British/ rather than of a French, Admiral. Throughout the War the British Navy has been increasing in strength, in confidence, and in experience, whilst the French Fleet has been doing exactly   the opposite.     One cannot, contemplate with equanimity the possibility of an Allied Naval Force appearing off Constantinople under the command of any but a British Admiral,,        Efficiency requires such a step, prestige requires such a step, and the political aspects after the V/ar require such a step.In view of all the above, considerations, the claims of a British Admiral to command any future naval operations against Turkey cannot seriously be contested, and should on no account be relinquished.(Signed) R.
