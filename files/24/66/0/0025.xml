October 1918.SECRET.G.T.-5925. 4f)THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending the 9th October, 1918.Summary.Part I.: General Remarks.The attitude of the labour press to the German peace offer is described.Part 11: Press Comments.The opinion of the labour press on foreign politics, with special reference to Germany and Russia; on home politics, with special reference to the Liberal Party and the General.Election ; on home affairs, with special reference to the railway strke and to pensions and allowances, and on food is described.Part 111.: District Reports.The industrial situation generally is tranquil.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work. No stoppage of any importance has been reported.(6.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work. With the exception of the surface workers&apos; dispute, which is mentioned in Part III, no dispute of importance exists.I.-General Remarks.The Labour Press and the Peace Offer.As was to be expected the receipt of the German Peace Note is the signal for a chorus of approval in the LLP. organs of the press. The &quot;Herald,&quot; &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; &quot; Call,&quot; &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; and the &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot; are all at one in demanding that an armistice shall be concluded at the earliest possible moment, to be followed by negotiations for peace. On the other hand, as was also to be expected, &quot; Justice &quot; raises the slogan &quot;No peace with the Hohenzollerns or the Hapsburgs.&quot;It is curious to note the unanimity with which Prince Max of Baden&apos;s &quot; sermon on the mount &quot; speed) is quoted by the pacifist papers as a credential for the character of his proposals. It is also argued generally that the reconstituted German Government is in fact representative of the people. In the &quot; Herald,&quot; for instance, it is stated that &quot;in the hour of&apos; defeat Prussian militarism has given way before the German people.&quot; The Government is described as a parliamentary Government. It is said that the present majority has made the Government and its policy. &quot; Forward&quot; suggests that the German Government is at least as democratic as the press directed bureaucracy which is at present the British form of Government. The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; thinks that the Chancellors speech expresses the view and the desire of the German people, so far as it can be voiced by a representative assembly. It is also of opinion that the new German Government can speak with as much authority for the German people as that by which President Wilson represents the American people.It is interesting to note that several of the papers demand that the question of an armistice be referred to a plebiscite of the electors of the country.[1100-50] B
With regard to the terms proposed it is generally anticipated that in return for evacuation of occupied territories the,German Government will demand similar action on the part of allied Powers, in respect of German territory at present in their possession.The &quot; Herald &quot; is of opinion that refusal to accept the German proposals can only be explained by ulterior objects in the war which have not been as yet revealed, and questions whether we ourselves are willing to accept all of President Wilson&apos;s fourteen points, as, for instance, the freedom of the seas. Generally, President Wilson&apos;s reply is considered to be hopeful, and the&apos;&quot;Labour Leader&quot; suggests that, even should an immediate armistice not be conceded, it is probable that negotiations will go on together with the fighting.II. Press Comments.(A.)-Military. [Nil.](B.) Foreign Politics.Germany.The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; criticises the new German coalition Government as being non-Socialist, and especially regrets the Majority&apos;s participation in a capitalist Government. On the other hand, it considers that the democratisation of Germany is proceeding at a more rapid rate than is the case in some of the allied countries.&quot; Justice&quot; contrasts the present attitude of the Majority with their bellicose tone in March when they spoke of &quot; a German peace won by the sword.&quot; Their recent con-version, it thinks, is apparent only, and a proof of sincerity is demanded in their complete abandonment of Prussian militarism. The &quot; Herald,&quot; commenting on Mr. Walter Long&apos;s speech, has a sarcastic article on the subject of the German colonies, in which we are exhorted to bear our burden of extended territory with humiiity, since it is the evident will of Providence that this kind of greatness should periodically be thrust upon us.Russia.The &quot; Herald &quot; contains a review by Mr. H. W. Nevinson of Mr. Farbman&apos;s well-informed book on &quot; Russia and the Struggle for Peace.&quot; The estrangement of Prussia is regarded by the reviewer as the worst of the man)&apos; laults committed by England during the war. A large section of the Pvussian people who formerly felt a genuine affection for England as the champion of popular and personal freedom has reluctantly had to turn towards Germany,The departure of Litvinoff gives the &quot; Call&quot; an opportunity of condemning England for the earlier treatment meted out to this gentleman ; and it thinks that his manner of departure from our midst should cause national shame and humiliation a view, however, that does not appear to be shared by official labour. The Scottish notes in the same issue of the &quot; Call&quot; contain an animated defence of Bolshevism.League of Nations.The &quot; Clarion &quot; thinks that Germany in the first instance should certainly be excluded from the League, and should only be admitted to membership upon giving proof of genuine repentance.   Such, it believes, is also the view of President Wilson.(C.) Rome Politics.Liberal Party.The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; suggests that the war has completed the collapse of historical Liberalism, and that Mr. Lloyd George is assured of the strong support of the party whatever he does. The &quot; Call &quot; points out that the programme of the National Minimum has been taken from the Fabian Society&apos;s programme just  it the moment when Webb goes over to the Labour Party. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; thinks that a growing number of Liberals, who realise that the p:-irty has ceased to exist, are grouping themselves round Mr. Henderson, while the &quot;Herald&quot; calls upon all those who are really Liberal, like Ponsonby and Trevelyan, to join the Labour Party.
General Election.The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; considers the prospect of an early general election less probable, and the &quot; Clarion &quot; thinks that the case against a general election now, from a purely patriotic point of view, is unanswerable.(D.) Home Affairs.Railway Strike.Most papers are agreed that the recent strike must be taken as a warning by trade union officials to consult the rank and file before completing any agreements. The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; thinks that it should prove a warning both to the leaders and to the Government, but is against throwing over the leaders except when they have been proved to be incompetent or unfaithful. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; and the &quot; Call &quot; are both frankly jubilant over the strike, and both of them criticise Mr. Thomas for his action. The &quot; Woolwich Pioneer&quot; gives a resume7 of Mr. J. J. Mallons article on the railway strike, which was originally contributed to the &quot;Daily News.&quot;Mr. Mallon considers that two features of the settlement stand out prominently ; (a.) The provision for the automatic adjustment of wages in accordance with the increase in the cost of living should do much to remove the friction which was necessarily begotten of the slow embittering procedure followed hitherto.(6.) The new award cuts across the recommendations of the Committee on National Expenditure, which laid it down as a principle that the worker is only entitled to maintain the purchasing standard of 1914 not to improve upon it.The new wage does represent an advance upon the pre-war standard but even so it is still 17s. below the standard suggested by Mr. Seebobm Eowntree.*Pensions and Allowances.The &quot; Woolwich Pioneer,&quot; in the course of a leading article, claims that the time has come when the rates of pensions and allowances should be revised. It defends its thesis on the ground that the cost of living is gradually mounting up, and that the high ideals professed by this country upon its entry into the war cannot possibly allow it to turn a deaf ear to the demands of those who have suffered most in defence of the same ideals. It points out that the vast majority of the sufferers will be members of the workingclass, and the first step in the amelioration of their lot should naturally come from the Labour world. It is also pointed out that the Scottish miners have already agreed to call a conference for the 10th October to consider the matter.(E.)-Food.The &quot; Herald &quot; suggests that the Ministry of Food should take over liquor establish-ments and run them as National Restaurants, paying each shareholder exactly what he paid for his shares by means of 5 per cent. War Bonds.III. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.The situation in this area is decidedly more disturbed than last week, trouble being especially noticeable among the aircraft workers.Unrest is again reported at Cubitfs, where the beltmen, oilers,. &amp;c, are about to demand an additional 2d. per hour ; while the findings of the Committee on Production regarding day workers&apos; wages are awaited with impatience.At Grahame White:s Aircraft Works a recent award is causing considerable dis-satisfaction, the men stili being anxious to obtain their original demand of id. per hour. A ballot is being taken to decide whether they shall cease overtime to enforce their demand; up to the present time there is a large majority against such action.Much dissatisfaction is stated to exist in the Hendon district because of the wholesale dismissals which are taking place in the aircraft works there.It is reported that the Governments Embargo Scheme is arousing serious unrest in West London, where munitions workers are protesting against the limitation of skilled workers in individual firms.[1100-50] B 2
A recent decision, stating that the high explosive workers at Woolwich are not entitled to an extra Id. per hour for overtime, has aroused considerable discontent among the workers concerned, who allege that it is a direct reversal of the Committee on Productions decision of the 27th August.A mass meeting called by the Woolwich Workers&apos; Society passed a strongly worded resolution demanding the reinstatement of Stubbs, and protesting against the continued employment of certain pacifist shop stewards.West Midlands.The embargo question is reported to be still arousing a good deal of hostile feeling in this district; skilled men object to being dismissed while War Munition Volunteers are retained. At the Siddeley Deasy Works, for example, a number of skilled wood-workers successfully protested against their dismissal. They were retained by the firm. Trade Union officials state that no trouble would arise if the War Munition Volunteers were turned off first.Unrest is spreading at Austin&apos;s and other Birmingham works because it is believed that foremen take advantage of their power of dismissal to get rid of men against whom they have grievances.It is reported that the Pattern Makers are dissatisfied with the recent 3s. advance. The A.S.E. are taking the matter up.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Conditions appear to be generally satisfactory in this area; no acute unrest is reported among the West Riding munitions workers, and around Nottingham the large number of recent awards affecting that district has quelled all signs of discontent.The majority of the Nottingham railwaymen have accepted the recent award. There is some disappointment among the Leicester railwaymen, who are under1 the impression that the sliding scale will merely bear relation to food prices not including the prices of clothes and household goods.The action taken by the Government in connection with the railwaymens and shipwrights&apos; strikes has made a strong impression on the workers in the West Riding; at a meeting at Leeds the opinion was expressed that a general strike among any class of labour would be unsuccessful owing to probable Government opposition.It is reported that trouble exists at Hadfields, Sheffield, over the price paid for gun work.   The men refuse arbitration on the question.North-WesternThere is no actual unrest reported from this area, though certain significant events have taken place.In Manchester, the members of the A.S.E. have lately been refusing to teach unskilled labour as a protest against the embargo. This policy has suddenly and unaccountably been reversed by the district committee, which now allows its members to teach diluted labour as before. The shop stewards are spreading the rumour that the Government has brought pressure to bear on the officials. According to the Ministry of Munitions&apos; report, the prospective dismissal of about 100 skilled men, owing to the limitations placed on dilution, may account for this sudden reversal of policy.&apos; .The Manchester Engineering Shop Stewards&apos; Committee has - refused to assist the local police in their demand for increased wages, and has decided that this force must fight its battles alone.It is reported that the embargo is much needed at Barrow, as numbers of skilled men are migrating to Ponder&apos;s End, where, it is said, 12Z. to 171. a week can be earned in the shell factory.It is reported that at a meeting of the Mersey Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation on the 4th October various questions were discussed. Among other matters it was decided that an increase of 15s. per week should be demanded, and that a forty-seven hours&apos; week should be claimed for the workers employed by Messrs. Cammell Laird.At a meeting of Messrs. Cammell Laird&apos;s employees on the 6th October a resolution was passed refusing to accept the award of the Liverpool Conciliation Board regarding the distinction between new and repair work; the men blamed the Trades Federation for allowing this question to go before the Board. It is expected by some that this decision on the part of the men will result in a lock-out.
With regard to the question of a shorter working week there was a strong element in favour of taking drastic action, but if it could be generally known that the firm has promised to introduce a forty-seveTi-hour week after the war, it is improbable that such action would result.Soidli Wales.No fresh signs of unrest are reported from this area.With regard to the origin of the railway strike it is reported that the Inde-pendent Labour Party and the international organisation of the I.W.W. are to some extent responsible for stirring up discontent among the younger lailwayrnen; further, it is stated that Bromley was playing a double r6ie. While, publicly, he declared himself against the men ceasing work, privately he was encouraging them to insist oa the original award.On the question of an eight hours&apos; day for surface workers, those employed at Cwm Colliery, near Llantrissant, have agreed that after fourteen days&apos; notice they will start working only eight hours.Scotland.Conditions on the Clyde are once more normal.It is reported that considerable unrest prevails among the Lanarkshire miners, owing to the insufficient supply and bad distribution of foodstuffs. In Blantyre the discontent became so acute that on the 2nd October a one-day strike took place 4as a protest against the present arrangements. At a conference of the Lanarkshire Miners&apos; Union, on the 28th September, a resolution was passed threatening a strike within two weeks, unless the Government promised to increase the allowances paid to soldiers&apos; and sailors&apos; dependents.The Dundee juteworkers are still refusing to work on Saturdays, in spite of the increased jute ration, which now provides work for the whole week.IV. Disputes.With the exception of considerable- unrest in the aircraft factories around London the industrial positron, as regards disputes, is tranquil.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The Admiralty Labour Department reports only one fresh stoppage of minor importance.   Conditions are unusually quiet in all areas.The Ministry of Munitions reports 3,275 workers on strike on the 2nd October compared with 994 at the end of the previous week.The most important strike still in progress is that of the tool-room workers at the National Fuse Factory, Tipton; more than 3,000 are on strike, owing to the dismissal of several skilled operatives and the employment of discharged soldiers at wages which are alleged to be lower than the shop rates.The strike of the packing-case makers at Messrs. J.. H. Helsby&apos;s (Manchester), reported two weeks ago, is now settled. The women dilutees, who were introduced without the men&apos;s approval, have been discharged, and the men been reinstated.The Coal Controller reports six new stoppages during the week; in every case, however, work has already been resumed.An unauthorised strike occurred at the Whitehaven Conipauy&apos;s collieries, Cumber-land, over the interpretation of a recent award. The men resumed work on the 7th October.The War Office Contracts Department reports one fresh stoppage.It is stated that the strike of the Kettering boot and shoe operatives has not had any serious effect on Army supplies.Reported from other Sources.The strike of the Holborn road-sweepers still continues.A strike is reported at Meister and JaftVs, Ilford, makers of small aeroplane parts, over the discbarge of an ex-soldier and the recognition of the Workers&apos; Union. A strike has occurred in the engineering department at Messrs. Peters, Kingston, owing to a wages dispute.
(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Admiralty Labour Department reports no fresh cases of importance.The Ministry of Munitions reports four cases.One of these affects the members of the Amalgamated Society of Woodcutting Machinists employed at Cardiff, Newport, Gloucester, and Swansea, who threaten to strike unless a minimum flat rate of Is. lid. per hour is granted them.The War Office Contracts Department reports four new cases.These include the demand on the part of the National Amalgamated Union of Labour for an advance in wages for certain members of the cutlery trade societies. It is believed that the employers will refuse to enter into negotiations unless the Unions consent to the unrestricted employment of-female labour.Reported from other sources.With reference to the dispute of the Walsall and Wednesbury Tube Workers, at a meeting of the men&apos;s representatives and the Midland Employers&apos; Federation on the 3rd October an offer of a 7  per cent, advance was eventually accepted by the men, and the strike notices were withdrawn.The employees in the Aero Woodwork Department of Messrs. Vickers (Crayford) threaten to strike unless the firm grants them the 5s. increase already paid at other works.At Whitehead&apos;s (Richmond and Feltham) the aircraft workers have tendered a week&apos;s 9      notice to strike unless the 4d. advance is granted them.The Committee on Production heard forty-four cases in London and one in Cornwall during the last week.These included (1) an application by the United Garment Workers&apos;Trade Union for 51. per week of fifty hours for male and female cutters; (2) an application for an advance of 3s. (5c/. a week for members of the National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, Firemen,Electrical Workers, &amp;c, employed by the manufacturers and dyers in Yorkshire; (3) various applications from Southampton shipwrights and engineers for wage advances to drillers, riggers, and sailmakers.In the Chief Industrial Commissioner s Department reports of 177 new differences have been received during the week.G.
