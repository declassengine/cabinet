PPhLswdocum^ of His Britannic Majeatyrs Government)WAR   C A B I HE T,SECRET.The Restoration of Pre-War Practices &amp;o.Bill *Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.Xne of the most important questions which must bemmsatisfactorily dealt with If the nation is to maintain an even keel during the difficult passage from war to peace is that associated with the Government pledges as to the restoration of trade mion practices,   I regard It aa a matter of tho most vital consequence to the Government and, thareforo, urge upon the War Cabinet the view that the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Bill after it has been discussed with representatives of the employers and the employed should bo introduced into the House of Commons as early as possiblesI,    The Prime Minister, then Minister of Munitions,speaking at Liverpool on the 4th June 1915 said.-&quot;We have given our undertaking as a Government and that undertaking has been inherited by a new Government *  That in, that those safeguards which have been&apos; established by trade union action prior to the war will be restored exactly in so far as the action of the Government i3 concerned.,8And again in the House of Commons on the 23rd June 1915:-nI would not say removal but suspension, during the War on the honour and pledge of the nation that things woulo. be restored exactly to the position they were.in before the suspension of all these -restrictions and practices which interfere with the increase of the output of war materials *11That pledge has been many times re-affirmed by members ofthe present and previous--Governments.
The actual pledges appear&apos;&apos;in their most concrete form in jiM^\^Kr^t^rbv^&apos;&apos;:AgremBnia,   In part they have been fulfilled by the provisions of the Munitions of War Acts,   In regard to certain aspoots of the pledges, however, no statutory provision has been made.(1)   The Treasury Agreement of 19th March 1915 deals with war work generally.   The Munitions of War Acts are narrower in scope and deal with munitions work onlyv In pursuance or in consequence of the Treasury Agreement a number of agreements have been made under the auspices of the Home Office between workmen and employers in trades outside the scope of tho Acts.   In general these agreements provide for dilution on condition that after the war pre-war praotices relating to the employment of any class of workmen should be restored.   The Government has a definite responsibility to see that the principle of these agreements Is carried out and this is not done by the Munitions Acts. .The Munitions of War Acts provide for restoration in controlled establishments, but do not provide for restoration in uncontrolled munitions establishments.The pledge with regard to new inventions contained in the Second Treasury Agreement (March 25th 1915) is not carried out by the Munitions of War Acts.Unless there is legislation to cover these points, the pledges which have been carried out in the Munitions of War Acts are practically valueless to the trade unions.   Moreover legislation Is necessary In order to establish procedure for carrying out the pledges.   The existing machinery for which provision is made in the Munitions of War Acts Is faulty in this respect.   The Bill is therefore necessary to deal/ with these outstanding points, to which the trade unions are justly entitled.
I was some time ago reminded by the parliamentary Committee of tho Trade Union Congress that many members of the present and former Governments had declared In public speeches that enlistment in the army should not be allowed to injure the economic status, position, and prospects of the workers.   Prominent trade union leaders appearing on recruiting platforms made the same appeal, following the lead given by responsible members of the Government.   Whatever legal limitations may be placed upon these promises, the broad fact remains that promises were made In the hour of need which have a definite concrete meaning In the minds of the working classes and which if not redeemed will be a source of grave trouble after the War.   I would suggest that here is no half-way house between repudiation and fulfilment. Repudiation is unthinkable.   On the other hand the honour of the Government is deeply Involved in the fulfilment of the pledge.   On this ground alone, the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Bill Is a necessary measure.II,   In the second place, almost every avenue towards industrial reconstruction Is at present a cul-de-sac, blocked by the restoration question.   At every turn, in my efforts to deal with the many complicated labour and industrial problems arising out of the war, I am brought face to face with an unfulfilled promise and a series of questions which cannot be settled until the promise is redeemed.   The future of women in industry, the p*ace of the semi-skilled worker, the development of improved methods, increased productivity, all depend in the last resort, upon the attitude of the trade unions of skilled workers, which will be determined by the action of the Government with regard to its obligations to give them the right to restoration of pre-war practices. Labour resettlement hinges upon the Intentions of the skilled unions, and unless the resettlement of labour in industry
can bo carried through smoothly, the re-establishment of industry and commerce will be perilously delayed and an outbreak of industrial discontent will be. more than probable.III.   It has been urged that to introduce legislation for the restoration of pre-war practices Is to take a retrograde step and to put bock the clock of industrial progress *   It is, however, perfectly clear that it is impossible to start after the war with a clean slate, and to obliterate the past.   On the other hand, It is equally clear that the industrial experience gained furing the War cannot be thrown away and it is most desirable that tn the post-war period industry should be developed along the lines suggested by the best experience of the war period. The question is whether this end is likely to be reached by the method of refusing to honour a pledge given tc a powerful section of the trade union movement, or whether it is more probable that it will be attained by a generous fulfilment of the pledge.There can be no doubt thai if the Government does not Introduce a measure to supplement the provisions of the Munitions of War Acts, the temper of tho organised skilled workers will be such as to make the establishment of working rules more in harmony with the new conditions and opportunities impossible.  The Government will in these circumstances have to face ths stubborn opposition of the skilled unions, smarting under a sense of injustice,   Cn the other hand, if the Government grants to the skilled unions, the power to enforce restoration,then alternative agreements   may be reached which will not hamper industrial progress.It is to be remembered that the skilled workers do not desire new legislation regarding war pledges in order to insist on literal restoration, but aa a bargaining weapon to be used in obtaining new labour conditions.  The unions, I believe, fully realise that the far-reaching character of tho industrial changes that have taken place make it imperative that trade union rules should be adapted to the new circumstances.   But I am convinced that
to attempt to preaerve^thennore efficient methods of production liJtr^dHice4^huHjug the War by withholding from tho skilled trades legislation to which, in my judgment, they are entitled, will end in disaster,IV.   Lastly, I would suggest that the prevailing labour unrest is in some degree attributable to suspicion of the Government, due to the failure to introduce legislation, on this subject.There is considerable weight of evidence in favour of an early introduction of tho Restoration of Fre-War Practices Bill. Sir Stephenson Kent, Chairman of the Interdepartmental Conference which drafted the Bill, in transmitting the draft of the Bill to me, stated in a covering letter (circulated to the War Cabinet, (G*T.5617) that he was &quot;strongly of opinion that there 13 a very real demand for, and grievance in the dolay In the production of this Bill.&quot;Sir David Shaekleton in his Memorandum to the War Cabinet on !The Wages Situation1 (G.T*5740) states that &quot;the Ministry of Labour once again ask the War Cabinet to consider seriously, a definite announcement on behalf of the whole Government that a Bill to restore trade union conditions, as honestly as Is possible under the changed situation of the War, has been drafted, and will be submitted.to Parliament at the earliest possible moment.  The effect of such a pronouncement might go far to clear up the whole industrial situation, the trouble of which has been caused as much by distrust of the Government*s intentions, as perhaps anything else.  That that distrust may be unfounded unfortunately will not dispose of : its existence.&quot;Mr, Justice McCardie^ EmbargoCommit tee, in its Interim Report, points out that &quot;amongst the matters to. which importance was attached by witnesses&quot; regarding the underlying causes of the Coventry dispute, wee the fact thai &quot;Government aotion for the purpose of redeeming the pledges given with regard to the restoration of pre-war conditions has been unduly delayed.&quot;
Those who are closely in touch with labour opinion are unanimous lri the view that such Government action Is an urgent noed,J hope, therefore, that the War Gauinet will approve the early introduction of the Restoration of Pre-War Practioea Bill.CADDIS ON. 14*10*18,
