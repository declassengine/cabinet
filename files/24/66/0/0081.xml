TRADE.September, 1918.I circulate for tho information of the War Cabinet the following brief eooount of the work: of the Board of Trade during the mo&amp;th of September, 1918, which deals only with a few of the more important questions likely to interest m;y o olio agues and does not profess to bean aooount of the ordinary departmental work ef tho Board, or to include all tho important questions considered by tho Department,A.H.STANLEY.14th Ootober, 1918.cc:j:^::0:; apd intistry.In opposition to the advice of their loaders, the Spinners decided by a large majority on ballot to Ocme out on strike to enforce the payment &quot;by the Cotton Control Board of unemployment benefit for timo lost through short time and to secure the restoration of the rota system of   &quot;playing off&apos;r. Subsequently it appeared, that the meh&quot;would probably not insist^ on the return o% the rota system if they were pai6. for the short time (amounting io ubout ten hor.s,&apos; week, in tie American soetion) enforced by the Cotton Control Board owing to the short ago at raw cotton.   The operatives were warned that in case of a strike, the  Government would appty for an injunction to restrain thoir -onion from paying strika pay on^the ground that a strike weald involve interference wita thf st$ply of war, Material.  An interim injunction was obtained on September llth, but the operatives came out on strike on the 16th.  Pour days lator they agreed to return to work as a reauit of a letter addressed &quot;by the Primo Uinister to the Secretary of the Amalgam mated Spinners asking tho men to return to work in the national^ interest ard leave the dooision of tbe matters in dispute to the Government after an inquiry by a tribunal to be appointed at once by the Oovernmant.  In response tho men returned to work, on September 23rd.  The tribunal hac now been formed and 1ms be Id a preliminary meeting and will hold -its first meeting in Hanohestor in Ootober for tho purpose of hearing evidence regarding the matt ores in dispute.A member of the Commission set up in Lgypt to control Egyptian ootton (Mr.Ralph Car-/or) has visited this oountry and the opportunity has been taken to introduce oertaiJi^nodiflceU^mB tobo tho arrangementb for disposing of the crop.iSpinners in this country will be rationed as regards their supply so as to secure proper distribution here axd in return they will receive a guarantee that orders placed now, up to the amount of a preliminary ration oquivalont to 6 months consumption, will be dealt with on tho basis of the present official sale prices, even though it should be necessary later to raise thorn.  Provision has also been made for a limited ouentity of cotton to bo placed-at the free ^ia o&quot;sal of merobeBftte in this country in addition to the amount they order on behalf of &apos;i^;;tvjxk: i.&apos;v,:!.nn&apos;srs.

Liverpool merchants as a result of the margin between official sale values in Egypt and official maximum prices in the United Kingdom, have seen reduced by lowering the latter to the extent of 3//4d per lb.

Steps have also been taken  in conjunction with the Raw Materials Department of the War Office with a view to reserving sufficient supplies of particular types of cotton to meet the requirements of the latter Department.  The supplies are required, speaking generally, for aircraft.

Arrangements have also been made for ascertaining the supplies of special sorts of cotton required by our Allies for military purposes  and for so controlling the export of the varieties as to ensure that these military needs secure priority.

??? In connexion with the negotiations which are proceeding between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government for the abolition of the regime of the Capitulations in Egypt and in the French Zone of Morocco, the draft of a Treaty has been prepared toy my Department at the request of the Foreign Office with a view to regulating the trade and commerce of these countries with France and the United Kingdom respectively.  The principal object aimed at has been to recover our eventual freedom with respect to the customs treatment by Egypt of imports from the British Empire whilst protecting ourselves so far as possible from loss of advantages in Morocco.

??? Treasury sanction having been obtained for concluding an agreement between my Department and Mr. Leslie Urquhart to act as agent of His Majesty&apos;s Government in supplying goods to ?, a certain amount of goods urgently required, principally cottons and ? goods have already been despatched.

???. Messrs H.R. Merton &amp; Company has gone into voluntary liquidation as a result of the refusal to grant a licence to the Company under the Act.

? OWNED COPYRIGHTS Among the applications which have been heard during this month for licences to publish enemy owned copyrights may be mentioned one of particular interest viz., that by Longmans, Green and Company for permission to publish a translation of Emil Zimmermann&apos;s book entitled "The German Empire of Central Africa&apos;. This application was made at the request of Central Africa&apos;. This application was made at the request of the Ministry of Information and a large number ? copies of the book will be distributed free for ? purposes. A licence has been recommended.

Other applications have been heard in connection with the copyrights of several pictures formerly held by the Berlin Photographic Company and F. Hanfstaengl Limited and licences were recommended in those cases to be granted to the British Art Company Limited who propose to reproduce the pictures in the United Kingdom. Formerly the plates for these prints and the prints themselves were all made in Germany.

WAYS.m pro-mmidishPLIES TO KKAI.3 &amp; USHERS.PUBLIC SERVICES ADMXSI3TRATI0H.In my last report to tho War Cabinet I mentioned that thoro was ai agitation auong Railway ma nv for a farther increase in their mr wages.    This agitation oame to a ha ad towards the ond of last month, and, as the -Jar Cabinet are aware, I evontually arrived t  a settlement with the repreemtj atives of tho two Unions concerned on tho basis of a 5/-a week increase, making a total of 30/- a week, in the war wages of men of 18 years of ago and over, and 3/&amp;d a waok in the case of boys uidor 18.   Furthor, it &apos;,7as arranged with tho consent of the *ar Cabinet, that machinery should be set up to provide that on inoroasos taking place In tho cost of living, increases in the war wages of the men coming under the settlement should bo given automatically and periodicallySouthCossation of work,commono tag in place, howovor, but the trouble is now overWales, tookI have sinoo had discussions with representatives of tho Ministry of Labour and tho hallway Executive Committae regard to the arrangements to be mado to provide automatic increases of war wages as the cost of living goes up aad I havo seen representatives of the two Unions and put before thorn a scheme, which would provide automatically for the increases in wages.   I Uiink the Unions will be prepared to accept generally.    I am holding a further moating with tie representatives of the i.&apos;;;?ion3 on the 13th October.One of the more important considerations to bo borne in mind In setting up a scheme of this kind is that it may prove the forerunner of similar schemos Hox some of tho other large Industrie s and uniformity of conduct and co-ordination of decisions aro therefore essential.    Por this reason I think it is dosirablq and even essential that the body or panelset up to deal with the mat tor should be connected with and undor tho supervision of tho Ministry of labour.   I think that the Union representatives will agree to this arrangement.PAPER CONTROL.In accordance with tho request received from the Allied Maritime Transport Council, meetings havo been held with the Pronch, Italian and American  delegates in ordwr to disuuss Paper Programmes for the oeroal year 1918/19.    Programmes have been drawn up accordin&amp;Ly and aro in process of sub-mis ai on.Business has continued active during the month, paid into tho Controller&apos;  643,847. 5. 1.The sumss account at the Bank amounted toSpecial enquiries havo boon made into tbe position of about 60 Trade &amp; Technical Journals, and assistance has been givon to most of thorn, to obtain such oxbr a supplies of paper as appear to be essential.Similar assistance has also been givon to a number of publishers of Educational Books, sad in those cases a special quality of papor has been arranged for by the Department, y.niofc
has been produced at a low price, and at mills which were favourably situated for transport and whose coal consumption was upon an economical basis.

Pressure has also been put upon certain mills, and dealers who have been charging exorbitant prices, and more reasonable rates have generally been agreed to.

COAL CONTROL.

About 20,000 lower category men had been returned to the mines by the end of September.

There were two serious interferences of output during the month, one due to the railway strike by which considerably over 100,000 tons of coal were lost, and the other due to a minimum wage strike of putters at certain collieries in Durham.

In conjunction with the Coal Controller I am addressing meetings of miners in the various coalfields to urge the necessity for increasing the output of coal.

The first formal meeting of the recently formed Allied Coal Programme Committee was held on the 27th September.

The most important of the questions requiring a decision is the demand for the American Army which by June next will reach a rate of nearly 10,000,000 tons per annum.

An Order has been made limiting the price of gas coke used for industrial purposes.

TIMBER SUPPLIES.

WOOD FOR FUEL. Arrangements have been made to put as much fuel wood as possible at the disposal of the Coal Mines Dept., including such wood from the operations of private Timber Merchants.

AMERICAN REQUIREMENTS. The large demand for Timber for the U.S. Forces, amounting to a minimum of 10,000 stds. per month, is difficult to meet on account of shortage of tonnage. A series of Meetings have taken place, including one at G.H.Q. France, when it was arranged to supply part of the demand from French woods through the Directorate of Forestry, but on the understanding that an equivalent amount of imported timber would be delivered to Northern French ports in replacement. This matter is receiving consideration by the Allied Maritime Transport Committee.

TIMBER FOR SHIPBUILDING Owing to the lack of shipments of timber for the Admiralty and Ship-building programmes, from the White Sea and Canada, a somewhat critical situation exists.  The position has been brought to the notice of the Shipping Controller who is making arrangements for three ships to load at once from stocks in Canada, and for 10,000 standards to be lifted before the closing  of the St.Lawrence.

GENERAL. The timber position as a whole, in view of the successive large demands, becoming very ?. It is probable that steps for a further reduction of consumption will have to be taken, unless further tonnage can be allocated.

TOBACCO CONTROL.

The position will  regard to stocks in hand has somewhat improved since the issue of the last report owing to satisfact-
ory imports during September which amounted to 11,684 tone. Clearances from bond for mnufaoture during the month were 7,146 tons, leaving stocks on 30th September at 57,106 tons.,?RTR0L COKTBOI.During tho recent railway strike the ;Petrol Control Department co-operatod with the Road Transport Board and provided additional petrol for the transport of food and munitions.ROAD TRANSPORT.H/vVAY Consequent on tho railway strike many calls wero madeOXE.       on the organisation of the $L.T.Board for tho provision  of onsrgonoy transport, principally for the carriage of food stuffs.    Tho Board&apos;s organisation was placod at the dia-posal of tho Ministry of Pood and the Divisional Road Trans-port Off icors , oy means of the classified register of road transport vohicloe recently compiled, wore able to select without delay or disorganisation of osoential transport suitable vehiclos to meet all demands mado ipon thorn.   At tho roquost of tho Ministry of Pood a large quantity of milk, moat, yoast, and margarine, we re convey od by road from the aroas af ibetod. to London and other places where they wore urgently in demand.   Tho shor tags of food wa3 most aor-p ious in South Wales and considerable eupplio3 wore removed by road from tho oouth Western Division to reliovo tho situation.    Dislocation of important war industries was avoided by conveying munition workers and dock labourors to their work in lorries.   After the strikers had returned to work, the dolay causod by the congestion on the railways was, in many cases, obviated by continued provision of trans-port for food stuffs.
