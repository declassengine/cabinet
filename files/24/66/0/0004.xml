[NOT TO BE COMMUNICATED TO ANYONE NOT IN H,M. SERVICE.]Royal Air Force( Memtekranean District )Monthly ReportofAir OperationsJuly , 1918.ROYAL AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS, (Mediterranean District), MALTA.
SECTION I.ANTI-SUBMAEINE REPORT AND STATISTICAL TABLES.AEGEAN GROUP,     (9th June-13th July.)Routine dawn patrols have been carried out by seaplanes from Talikna (Lemnos), Suda, Syra and Skyros, and by land machines&apos; from Imbros, Stavros and the Greek and British units..at at Romanos (Lemnos). Other submarine, swept channel and escort patrols have been performed as required.A Camel on reconnaissance from Imbros sighted a submarine at 1745 on 11th June in lat. 40o 25&apos; N., long. 260 20&apos; E. As no wireless was carried it returned and reported, but it was then too dark for operations to be, undertaken by aircraft. (As this machine carried no bombs the report of submarine sighting is not included in Statistical Table.)Short seaplane No. N. 1746, left Talikna on 1st July to search area between Lemnos and Thasoi and escort back a Henri Farman on passage from Thaso;. Magneto trouble forced a landing about 10 miles from Thaso when the machine was towed to destination by a motor launch. Repairs were,executed:at Thaso.and machine returned to.unit on the 5th, performing a patrol on the way.A Short, No. N.2534, on 4th Julv having performed patrol to S.E.. followed a wash to.the Doro Channel, and was.returning to base when engine trouble, due to. burst petrol pipes, caused a descent to be made 15 miles S.W. of Trebuki at 0710. Bombs were released and the wind carried the machine to S.E. till eleven hours later Short No. N. 2633, which had been out to search, landed alongside. Previous to this, a brigantine had come almost within hailing distance but took no notice. Short No. N. 2633 was going for help, but could not take off owing to burst petrol pipe so put out drogue and jettisoned bombs. Both machines remained in Aldis lamp communication all night. Soon after dawn a brigantine approached and answered signals by waving handkerchiefs while an observer tried to swim to the ship, but the brigantine stood off when he got within 30 yards. Pilots and observers were eventually rescued by a trawler.At 1457 on 5th July the periscope of a submarine was sighted steering east in lat. 40o 06&apos; N., long. 250 41&apos; E., and next morning a machine carrying out reconnaissance of the Straits reported a submarine in Sari Siglar Bay.An attached aircraft carrier commenced patrols from Port Trebuki, Skyros, on 1st July.The Skyros seaplane base at first.-established at Port Molos was on 7th to 13th June moved to a more suitable-site at Kalamitza Bay.ADRIATIC GROUP    (16th June-20th July). 66 WING.Otranto.On 17th, 19th and 21st June, there were&apos; adverse weather conditions for flying, and during the week ending 6th July, a persistent wind kept the sea rough, and this, combined with a lack of machines in flying trim,, allowed of only little seaplane activity, but since this period patrols have been regularly carried out.Since 4th July, Shorts&apos;have been used to carry dispatches to and- from Valona when the weather has-been suitable.On 16th June, Short No. N. 1501 left on barrage patrol at 0935, but developed engine trouble and was forced to alight at 1345 on the sea, five miles north-east of St. Maria di Leuca. Base was informed by W/T and pigeon, and at 1610 the seaplane was taken in tow by a motor launch, reaching Otranto at. 1830.On 22nd June, two Shorts left at 0530 on northern patrol. About one hour1 later the weather became very bad and a W/T signal recalling both machines was sent out. This was at once picked up and the seaplanes returned safely by 0730.All available seaplanes were prepared for special duty on the 28th and 29th of July, and no patrols were therefore made on those days. (See Section III.).On&quot;11th July,, a Short seaplane was sent at 1450 to a position lat. 40o 12&apos; N., long. 190 03&apos; E., where a trawler reported a submarine-and patrolled round the vicinity where the submarine was believed to be submerged for an hour, without sighting anything unusual.On 19th July, on receipt of reports of submarine locations in positions.lat. 39Q 47/N., long. 190. 08rE., and lat. 390 52&apos; N., long 190 08&apos; E., Short seaplane No. N. 1501 was sent away to patrol the suspected area immediately on receipt of the first signal-1315. .&apos;At 1410, 1445 and 1453, further reports were received from positions lat. 390 52&apos; N., long. 180 57/ E.,Tat. 390 52&apos; N., long. 19013&apos; E., and Tat. 390 52&apos; N., long. 190 02&apos; E. respectively, and these reports were successfully transmitted to the seaplane by W/T. 0From this it seemed probable that two submarines were operating, and wore endeavouring to. pass the barrage to the south. Although, the seaplane remained out over the area till the last possible minute.no signs of either of the submarines was seen. W/T and Aldis lamp communication was maintained with the base and various vessels respectively at frequent intervals. The machine landed safely at 1830 in the failing light after a patrol of four hours duration.
67 WING.Santa Maria di Leuca.At about 0530 on 27th June, two Baby seaplanes dropped two 100-1 b. bombs on a large oil patch in position 15 miles south of Leuca. The barrage was informed accordingly. ,On 9th July, on the flight of a machine from Taranto to Santa Maria di Leuca, the pilot dropped a message addressed to the Senior Naval Officer, Gallipoli, reporting very large quantities of oil fifteen miles west of Gallipoli. On receipt of this information a division of drifters was sent out but failed to locate any submarine.A Baby seaplane left base at 1905 on 19th July, for Routine Patrol, course 230o 40 miles, 90o 20 miles and return.   When upon return course about fifteen miles from Faro lighthouse -submarine was plainly seen submerged, with periscope well above water, proceeding east at a speed of about three knots, the wake of the periscope being hardly visible.Machine descended to 200 feet and one 100-lb. bomb was dropped which missed submarine by about ninety feet, well to the right. Machine did a quick turn to avoid explosion of bomb, which was hardly noticeable, bomb being fused %\ seconds delay. Submarine carried on its course for about two minutes without further submersion, then changed course to S..E. and slowly submerged. Visibility was exceptionally good and submarine was kept in sight until depth of about sixty feet, then pilot was temporarily blinded by calcium while breaking open a flare and lost sight of the submarine. Two flares were dropped on the spot, also Very s lights were fired to attract attention of motor launch which was patrolling with machine about seven miles to the west. Message board was also dropped saying &quot;submarine submerged where calcium flare is, course of submarine S.E.&quot; A collier, steamer and drifter were within a radius of seven miles from spot, and these vessels interfered with the hydrophone from the motor launch which returned to Base at 2100 having lost position of Submarine in the noise of the passing vessels.Submarine appeared to be camouflaged green and black and this was visible on deck while under water.  Splash of black forward of conning tower, also diagonal stripe of black aft.An important convoy was observed approaching Leuca with destroyer escort on 19th July and Baby seaplane No. 1336 was despatched at 0938 to escort same. Convoy was left and machine returned to base at 1038, having escorted the convoy the maximum distance possible with the type of machine.On a patrol on 15th July communication was carried on with a motor launch very success-fully and further developments in this direction will shortly take place.Taranto.On 14th July Short No. N. 1500 left at 1200 to escort a convoy of five large ships. The convoy was picked up ten miles south and escorted until 1440 when bad weather prevented the seaplane going any further. Arrangements had been made with S. Maria di Leuca that the Short on approaching that station would signal the position of the convoy and another machine would immediately have been sent out to carry on the escort. However, the bad weather prevented this being done and the seaplane No. N. 1500 returned at 1540 with nothing to report.Kite Balloons, Brindisi.Balloon patrols were recommenced on 27th June, M.M. 43 leaving on patrol at 0925 on ihat date.On clearing from the coast the balloon was used for observation purposes during torpedo practice by several destroyers. The wake of the torpedoes could be easily traced in the water by the observers from the time of firing, and when passing approximately under the balloon the torpedo itself could be seen below the surface (depth judged approximately fifteen feet). When the torpedo came to rest on the surface the exact location could be given from the balloon at once to the destroyers.Subsequently the balloon proceeded on the usual patrol and returned to harbour at 1000 on 29th June. No enemy craft was sighted. Slight trouble was again experienced in the nose blowing in and the panting of the stabilisers with the consequent loss of gas.Balloon M.M. 93 proceeded to sea with a destroyer on 29th June. Severe storms of wind, lightning and rain were encountered, but through all these the balloon behaved in a satisfactory manner. Practices in conning ship from the balloon were carried out and were quite successful. No hostile craft were seen.   Balloon returned to base at 0930 2nd July.At 0900 2nd July Balloon M.M. 43 proceeded on patrol from a destroyer returning 0900 5th July. During this, patrol very sudden changes of weather were experienced, from dead calm and severe heat to thunderstorms and considerable wind forces.  No hostile craft were observed.On 3rd July, balloon M.M. 93 proceeded to sea to cany out experiments in spotting outside the swept channel. The experiments were in every way satisfactory, the wash of the periscope was observed and the submarine kept under observation for a considerable time -when she was entirely invisible from the ship. It was found that at a distance of about a mile from the ship when the submarine was submerged at sixty feet her hull was clearly visible although no wash or disturbance on the surface was observed.On 5th July, at 0930, balloon M.Mi 93 proceeded on patrol from a destroyer, returning on the 8th. No hostile craft was sighted during the patrol and the balloon behaved in a very satisfactory manner, only six bottles of hydrogen being used on the patrol. A heavy storm, accompanied by lightning was met with on 7th.  This, however, did not detrimentally affect the balloon.
22aBalloon A.M. 123 relieved balloon M.M. 93 on patrol leaving harbour at 0800, .8th July, and returning 1012,11th July. At .1955, 8th July, the feather of a submarine was observod from the balloon in tho path of rays which the sun was making along the sea, and tho ship was conned to the position. On nearing the spot it was reported to the bridge that although over the position where the submarine had dived, nothing could be seen of the submarine. The ship passing over the position altered course and steered south-east. At 2010, a patch of oil was observed on the water and reported to the bridge, the ship passing right through the centre of the patch. Beyond this no hostile craft was seen.On 13th July, balloon M.M. 133 proceeded to sea to carry out exercises outside the swept channel. General observation work was carried out with a submarine. Owing to a low heat haze and the glare of the sun, observations from the balloon were very difficult. When the submarine fired her torpedo the torpedo was seen as it left the submarine and the necessary orders were given to the bridge to avoid it. All that could be seen of the submarine when she dived was tho top of the periscope at a depth of a foot, but when she submerged to a greater depth nothing was able to be discerned.The practice in spotting was quite satisfactory: the first two observations were not correct but the remaining observations were all correct. Owing to the very low visibility the observations carried out were as good as could be expected under the circumstances.Balloon M.M. 93 which was forced to return to base on 12th July was repaired and left again on the same day at 1130. Towards the evening of the 13th, the balloon joined the drifter barrage in searching for a submerged enemy submarine. The submarine was located by hydrophones and depth charges dropped. The balloon then joined in watching for the submarine to rise. Observations were carried, on till 2025, when owing to extreme darkness and also slight electrical discharges it was considered necessary to bring observers down.Balloon M.M. 133 flown from a destroyer relieved M.M. 93 on patrol, leaving base at 0850, 14th July. The usual look-out and observation were kept but nothing occurred outside of the ordinary routine. Good weather was experienced throughout but visibility was very poor owing to a haze which hung over the water and in consequence it was found that the best results were obtained working at 400 to 500 feet. Balloon returned at 1230,17th, July. Maximum wind registered forty knots and balloon worked satisfactorily throughout the patrol. Total time flown at sea seventy-five hours forty minutes.Balloon A.M. 128 relieved M.M. 233 on patrol, leaving base 0700 on 17th July. Exercises in submarine attack and conning ship were carried out by each observer in turn during the 18th and 19th. On 18th, towards the end of the morning watch, the balloon reported an apparent wake of a periscope five or six miles away, bearing due north. The balloon steered the ship m its course and after a short time reported the disappearance of the wake but stated there was an appearance of an oil patch in its place. Later a track of semi-circular shape was reported by the balloon, bearing 340 degrees.  In each case the ship investigated the tracks but nothing further was seen.An experimental flight by moonlight was made on the evening of the 18th July. Balloon was let up at 2030 with observers and hauled down at 2145, the observers reporting that they could see nothing outside the rays of the moon on the water.On the 19th July, at 1700, a hostile submarine was reported by wireless to be proceeding north. The evening flight was therefore continued after dark until 2145 without result. Fine weather was experienced throughout the patrol and balloon returned to base at 1123 on the 20th. Total time flown seventy-six hours twenty-three minutes.EGYPT GROUP.     (9th June-20th July.)Attack on Submarine.Short seaplane No. N. 2904 and No. N. 1639 left to escort troop convoy into Alexandria at 0815,14th June. At 0847 the pilot of seaplane No. N. 1639 observed a destroyer drop a depth charge approximately six miles north-east of the outer buoy North West Channel. The seaplane which was about a mile away to the south-east of this position at once proceded to the spot; almost immediately afterwards, the tops of two periscopes and a swirl were sighted about 400 yards north-east of the position of the destroyer and steering north-east. Machine at once fired &quot; submarine in sight&quot; signal and proceeded to attack and one 651b. bomb with 24 seconds delay action fuze was dropped and observed to explode 30 feet ahead and directly in line with the periscopes. This was at 0900 and the machine then turned around and the second bomb was dropped, also a 651b., ahead of the last position bombed. The machine remained in the vicinity for about thirty minutes and then proceeded to join up with the convoy.At 0900 the pilot of seaplane No. N. 2904 observed seaplane No. N. 1639 drop a bomb and he at once proceeded to the position. When approximately six miles north-east of the outer buoy, North West Channel, the wash of a submarine was sighted steering east. Machine proceeded to attack and at 0910 one 2301b. bomb with %\ seconds delay action fuse was dropped and was observed to explode seventy feet ahead and in a line with the wash. The pilot was unable to drop his remaining bombs owing to the proximity of a destroyer which at once proceeded to the spot. The machine remained in the vicinity for about thirty minutes and then proceeded to carry on with the convoy patrol.The pilot of seaplane No. N. 1639 reports that about thirty minutes after the bombs were dropped and in the same position he observed two patches of air upheavals, each about four feet in diameter and about twelve feet apart, but otherwise no apparent result was seen other than the residue of the bombs.
GIBRALTAR GROUP.     (2nd Juno-20th July.) Anti-submarine patrols have been curried out as far as circumstances permitted.Kite Balloons.  (30th June-9th July.)Balloon M.M. 71 was transferred from shore to ship at midnight on 29-30th June. The ship proceeded to Bizerta with tho balloon in tow. The balloon was landed at Bizerta at 1130 on 4th July, having completed the journey without any mishap and requiring only very minor repairs. She was again transferred to a ship on 5th July at 0900 and was taken to Gibraltar where she was landed at 1700, 9th July. No mishap occured on tlie return journey but excessive wind speeds were encountered from 0200 onwards on the last day with the result that a large quantity of gas was forced out of the balloon and she was only just able to make her destination.The balloon was in the air for a total of 210$ hours. Of this time observers were in the basket for 101 hours, the wind speeds varying from nil to five knots whilst observers were actually up.No difficulties were experienced in topping up the balloon except on the first night when the wind speed made it difficult to get the balloon down on deck ; the balloon was therefore topped up next morning, only sixteen bottles were required on the way to Bizerta and 25 on the return journey. Twenty-seven bottles were however required when balloon was landed at Gibraltar.Atmospherics were reported to be prevalent on the evening of 7th July, and lightning was observed from the deck. No observers were up at the time and the cable was earthed in accordance with instructions.With regard to observation from the balloon it was found that visibility was exceedingly low practically every day ; various heights for towing were tried and it was discovered that the best visibility was obtained at about 6 700 feet, but even at this height it was impossible to see the convoy from the position of the balloon on several occasions.&apos; &apos; MALTA GROUP.     (1st-20th July).Flying has been possible on every day during the period under review, except on the 2nd when strong easterly winds prevailed and on the 7th when a thick mist prevented it. Flying was carried out on every other day, though on a few days difficulty was experienced in getting machines off the water owing to swell.Details of attacks carried out.At 0800 G-.M.T. on 17th July, F. 3 boat No. N. 4311 left base and steered 170o for seventy miles. At 0850 machine sighted convoy of seven ships escorted by one destroyer and three trawlers and patrolled around them until 0900 when the pilot observed long trails of smoke approximately fifteen miles west of convoy ; this was investigated as far as possible and a trawler was sighted which appeared to be discharging smoke &quot;bombs of varied colours. Pilot then steered south-east to an object in the haze which turned out to be a merchant ship which however was not noticed to be damaged. Machine then went back to the convoy, and when about twelve miles off a white streak on the water was seen about eight miles from convoy off starboard bow. This white streak soon disappeared, and when over position the shadow of a submarine could be seen and a slight disturbance on the water in the form of a froth and swell. Two 2301b. bombs were dropped and one was observed to explode directly in the shadow and the other failed to explode. A photograph was taken of the object and explosion. Nothing except bubbles was observed, and machine steered for base where it arrived at 1130 G.M.T. As no wreckage or oil came to the surface after the explosion it is considered unlikely that submarine was damaged.On 18th July, Short seaplane No. N. 1504 left on patrol at 1540 and intercepted convoy of ten (steamships with escort.At 1720, whilst patrolling ahead of convoy in position lat. 360 03&apos; N., long. 130 57&apos; E,, the wake of a submarine was observed on the starboard bow of a convoy three miles distant. Machine altered course and at 1725 one 2301b. bomb with 2^ second delay fuse was dropped and exploded just ahead of submerged submarine which could be seen at an estimated depth of sixty feet steering south across the convoy&apos;s bows. No wreckage or oil came to the surface. The second 2301b. bomb was not dropped as no trace of submarine could be seen after the explosion of first bomb. Two calcium flares were then dropped to mark position, and then an attempt was made by lamp to get into communicaton with a trawler. This failed, so a message buoy was dropped to a motor launch with &quot; Take care two miles ahead of you enemy submarine ; bombed same but too deep &quot; upon it. The motor launch was not seen to pick up buoy. Machine then got into communication with a destroyer, and&quot; the following message was sentTake care two miles ahead enemy submarine steering south, 1748.&quot; This was received and acknowledged by the destroyer. Trawler then fired a gun and convoy altered course. Destroyer and trawler closed in upon position and made every appearance of attacking submarine. A thorough search was made by seaplane, but no sign of submarine or wreckage could be seen.Seaplane then had to return to base owing to failing light. It is considered improbable that this submarine was damaged by the bomb, but an attack on the convoy was probably averted.Seaplanes from an Aircraft Carrier have been employed during the latter half of July in patrolling and escorting convoys off the coast of Sicily. From the 15th to 23rd July, an average of two machines was available, and with these an average of nearly six hours flying a day was maintained. With only a few exceptions all convoys leaving or arriving were escorted for periods varying from two to over four hours. On 22nd July, Short No. N. 2809 was sent on routine patrol and sighted a large convoy steering north. The convoy was thereupon escorted for over four hours, a total of over forty miles being covered. A submarine was reported near the area passed some two hours later.
5On the same day a submarine was reported-by the Italian authorities and Short No. N. 1828 was immediately despatched to investigate and search the area indicated. Later, on receipt of a farther report, a second machine, Short No. N. 2809, was sent to reinforce tho first. An extensive search was carried out by these two machines but the submarine was not sighted. A large convoy was, however, picked up and escorted well into the Messina Straits.No flying was possible from 24th to 28th July as all machines were out of action. On the evening of, the 28th a submarine was sighted and attacked a convoy, but though patrols were resumed on 29th and 30th July the submarine was not sighted.STATISTICAL TABLES, AEGEAN GROUP.From 9th June to 6th July.Unit.

ENEMY COAST AND LAND RECONNAISSANCE.AEGEAN GROUP.     (9th -June-13th July.)Lemnos.The D.H. 4 machines which bombed Uzun Keupri railway bridge and station on 9th June also carried out reconnaissance of this area. A good photograph was obtained of a new aerodrome consisting of four &quot; T &quot; shaped hangars, the presence of which had been suspected since the raid against Kuleli Burgas on 5th June. Three machines were observed, but they did not interfere with bombing operations.Further photographs of this aerodrome were obtained on the 12th June on the occasion of a bombing raid from Lemnos and Imbros.In response to a report of enemy activity in Smyrna Gulf two D.H. 4 machines left Romanos at 0330 on the 16th June to make a reconnaissance. They examined the Gulf to Vourla Skala but observed nothing abnormal.Stavros.Escorted reconnaissances of the Lower Struma line were made for the army on every occasion required. Photographs were taken on the 9th, 12th, 15th and 26th of June and on the 4th, 7th, 9th and 12th of July,Drama aerodrome was reconnoitred on the 15th June and besides the one large and four small hangars previously reported, another small hangar was under construction. Five machines were seen of which two left the ground but did not attack.Escorted spotting flight made for Navy and Army on 17th June reported no &quot; O.K.&apos;s&quot; though four bursts were seen within ten yards of target. The escort was hit three times by anti-aircraft fireFive Russian prisoners who escapedi to Thaso from Porto Lagos reported that three aeroplanes arrived on the 12th June at Gereviz by air from Constantinople and were to commence reconnaissance on the 13th. Reconnaissance made on the 2.1st, reported one large and three small hangars. No machines were observed but from the fact that very effective anti-aircraft fire can still be put up from Gereviz our machine was hit it appears that the enemy propose to keep up the establishment at this station.Gliki. :In connection with the Dardanelles blockade the Straits were reconnoitred at dawn and dusk every day on which the weather was suitable.
247Officer Commanding Troops, Tenedos, reported enemy camp transport and cavalry on the enemy coast on tho .1.0th June. Reconnaissance made at once from Kuni Kale to Cape Baba by three DM. 4&apos;s and one Sopwith Bomber escorted by five Camels failed to discover any reason for report, and a further reconnaissance the next morning had a like result. For a report of bombing, see Section III. of this report.Pamphlets were dropped in the vicinity of the Straits on several occasions.Other reconnaissances were made as follows :-On 25th June. Photographs taken of Seidler Bridge and Malgara and pamphlets dropped on villages en route.On 27th June. Photographs taken of Uzun Keupri and Kuleli Burgas. At the aerodrome, the third hangar from the town, which was set on fire by one of our bombs on the 12th June, has apparently not been re-erected.  Pamphlets dropped en route.On 28th June. Photographs were taken of Keshan area including one of a shed to south-west, and of what was reported by a Greek refugee to be a landing ground. Neither appear to be much used.ADRIATIC GROUP.  (16th June-20th July.Bad weather prevented any flying being carried out during the early part of the period under review.On 23rd June, two D.H. 4 machines left Otranto at 0555 to make a photographic reconnaissance of the Gulf of Teodo, with a view to ascertaining supposed movements of transports and material Although excellent visibility prevailed when the machines left the Italian coast, very bad cloud-banks were experienced on approaching the objective. Nevertheless, an extremely successful line of photographs was taken.The shipping appeared to be disposed as before, with the following important changes:  Three Novara class light cruisers were noted instead of one. No submarines were lying at their base, and only one was observed at the destroyer base. One was in the floating dock at Teodo, and several were already submerged or in the act of submerging in the stream off Kumbor.Warning of hostile aircraft had apparently been given some time previous to the approach of the D.H. 4&apos;s, probably owing to an Italian raid on Durazzo at about 0500 the same morning.Two hostile land machines were seen at a height of 10,000 feet over the Gulf. Either one of these, or possibly a third, attacked a DM. 4 when over Teodo. When at a range of 200 feet, a full pan of ammunition was fired at it, and hits were observed. During the burst, the scout machine was observed to dive and spin rapidly into a thick cloud, apparently not under control. The aeroplane  a single seater - was about the size of a Camel but had a stationary engine.Anti-aircraft fire was severe, but not accurate, shells bursting up to 16,000 feet.The two D.H.4 machines after taking seventy photographs returned to Otranto by 1020.During this operation two Short seaplanes and F. 3 flying boat acted as escort.On 17th July, four D.H. 9 machines from Taranto carried out a bombing raid on the Gulf of Cattaro and photographs were taken of the submarine base and shipping in the Gulf.There was no apparent change in the war units. The three &quot;Erzherzog Karl&quot; class ships were in the usual position. In addition to information gathered from the photographs the pilots and gunlayers report: (a) Four four-funnelled cruisers in the Bay of Itisano.(b) Three light cruisers in the entrance to the Gulf of Cattaro.During the operations in conjunction with the Italian offensive in Albania the following reconnaissances and special flights were carried out. For complete summary of these operations see Section III.On 6th July, at 0420, three D.H. 9 machines left Taranto to carry out a bombing raid on Tirana aerodrome at 11,000 feet, and photographs of Durazzo where three large merchantmen with lighters alongside and three torpedo boat destroyers were seen at anchor, were taken en route.It was noted that the hangers at Tirana had been camouflaged and are now brown in colour.On the same, date, six D.H.4 machines carried out a bombing raid on Kuchi Bridge, and a reconnaissance of the area inland, (see Section III.). Photographs taken show plainly the position of an emergency aerodrome consisting of six white canvas hangars south of Fieri.At 1250, D.H.9 No. N. 6221 left Valona to attack any enemy troops on the north side of tbe Semeni River, and to bomb Kuchi Bridge. Four covered waggons were observed on the road north of Kuchi Bridge. Firo was opened on a group of soldiers who promptly scattered. There was slight anti-aircraft fire from a battery east of the bridge.At 0255, on 7th July, two D.H.4 machines left the Caproni aerodrome at Valona to carry out spotting in conjunction with two monitors. The objectives were the defences and communications on the enemy&apos;s right flank between the rivers Vojussa and Semeni. The first target was the village of Poyahi, where buildings were set on fire. The boats then shelled the bridges at Metali (on the Semeni). Owing to thick haze the target could not be observed although the shell bursts were plainly visible, and spotting corrections were sent by W/T with relation to the bend in the river, near the bridge. After ten minutes fire the monitors changed target to the high ground south of the Semeni, known as Maka Livokun. Rapid fire was commenced and shells were observed to be falling short.   Spotting corrections were given and the fire lifted to the road between Levano and
Fieri on which many hits were obtained. The western slopes of the hill were then subjected to a heavy fire, until white strips on the ground denoting the presence of Italian troops were observed. The message &quot; Troops now in position &quot; was flashed by Aldis lamp to the vessels. The summit of the mount then became the objective for fifteen minutes, when the &quot;cease fire&quot; was ordered, and both spotting machines returned at 0500.During these operations the machines were under continual fire both by anti-aircraft guns in the region of Fieri and field guns on Malta Livokun, but neither was hit.One hostile aeroplane rose, but did not attack.At 1530 on 8th July one machine carried out a bombing raid on Kuchi bridge and at the same time took photographs of the bridge and Fieri aerodrome and bridge which were then in our hands.Four miles north of Fieri bridge four horse transport waggons were observed proceeding north on the main road between Fieri and Lyushna. No other movements of troops or transport were observed on this road.A small gang of engineers was observed repairing Kuchi bridge which had been bombed previously.Two miles north of Berat on the Lyushna road fourteen motor transport waggons (covered) were seen proceeding slowly north.SECTION III.FIGHTING AND FIGHTER ESCORT WORK. BOMB RAIDS ON LAND OBJECTIVES.-ffiGEAN GROUP.     Detailed 9th June-13th July.     Telegraphic-27th July.Enemy machines have continued to reconnoitre Mavro and Tenedos regularly; on one occasion four machines were observed at the same time, but, as usual, they retired before it was possible to engage.Mitylene was reconnoitred by the enemy on 12th June. Lemnos.At 0800 of 9th June three D.H. 4 machines left Romanos to bomb railway bridge and station at Uzun Keupri. All reached their objective, and dropped 6 cwt. of bombs. Damage was done to station buildings but other results were unobserved owing to the presence of hostile aircraft. On return one machine overheated and had to descend in the sea six miles N.E. of Samothraki. Pilot and observer were rescued by a caique and transferred to a destroyer after they had fixed canvas floats to the machine, which was salved later by a trawler.One of the machines which reconnoitred Gulf of Smyrna on 16th June dropped a bomb on buildings which were probably stores for fort at north end of Long Island. Result was unobserved. The other machine owing to engine trouble was unable to wait for a suitable target, so aimed at a tug lying off Long Island but did not obtain a hit.In response to a report from Mitylene that a hostile machine was flying towards Lemnos two Camels patrolled over the island during the forenoon of the 20th June, but failed to sight anything hostile.TheMobile Squadron consisting of six D.H. 9 machines after practice in formation flying left for Imbros on 6th July to carry out from there a bombing attack on Constantinople.Stavros.Two D.H. 4&apos;s left to bomb transport at Razolivos on the 12th and 13th of June but had to return on each occasion.Hostile aircraft patrols were carried out on several occasions and on three patrols enemy machines were chased but not overtaken.Two bombs dropped on camp near Doksambos fell 15 20 yards west of camp on 16th June. The escorted reconnaissance machine which investigated reports of troops entering Lakovikia on 18th dropped 112 lbs. of H.E. on stores and quarters in the village, and.at dusk bombs were dropped on enemy front line works, but results could not be observed.On two occasions enemy machines have attempted to spot on to our front line positions. On the first occasion, 17th June, a two-seater was escorted by three D TIL Albatross. Four Camels left to attack. One dived on two-seater, which was hit and last seen going down over enemy territory, but was in turn attacked by D III. This machine was engaged by Camel but latter was forced to&apos;break off owing to jambing of one gun. The remaining DIIFs now attacked the Camel, but as the pilot was having trouble with his gun he dived, and they retired up the Angista Valley towards Drama.  The other two Camels did not sight hostile aircraft.The pilot of the Camel which came into contact with the enemy having expended his ammunition, returned to his base and left again in another machine to locate two-seater which seemed to have crashed.
9What was probably tho same machine was again spotting on the lKfh flnne. Two Dili scouts after attacking our front line reconnaissance, were engaged by a Camel. The pilot had his centre section hit sevoral times. He registered hits on both machines and they retired towards Drama, but picking up the two-seater in the Angista Valley they all returned to the front line, Tho same Camel again attacked but his starboard gun jambed and the two scouts dived on him, while he dived for his own aerodrome. Meanwhile, two Camels which had been sent to engage got into attacking position. The DIITs saw them and retirod towards Drama and were lost to sight.Four hostile aircraft were sighted by a patrol on .1.9th June but they could not bo brought to engagement.  Other hostile aircraft patrols during the week did not sight.On 21st Juno, a machine attacked a two-seater which had bombed a monitor proceeding to flank duty and saw his tracers entering fuselage. Both guns jambed so he was compelled to withdraw, and by the time one gun was cleared the hostile machine was too far away to be overtaken.A raid was made on Drama aerodromo on 26th June by five D.H. 4&apos;s escorted by Camels. 9-cwt. of bombs were dropped, and though no direct hits were obtained on hangars, one bomb burst on dump causing dense smoke which prevented observation of damage.400-lbs. of bombs were dropped on front line trenches and camps behind on 3rd and 5th July.Gliki, Imbros.During the dawn reconnaissance on 9th June, of area north and north-west of Imbros to enemy coast, 13 caiques were, observed at anchor in harbour at Dedeagatch. Bombs were dropped damaging two and destroying a third.The dawn reconnaissance of the Dardanelles on 10th June reported a steamer of 3,000 tons north of Nagara nets. A Sopwith Bomber escorted by two Camels left at once to attack it, but the 230-lb. bomb dropped 50 yards short of target. -^ The bombing reconnaissance made on 10th June in response to report of unusual enemy activity opposite Tenedos, dropped tour 112-lb. bombs and destroyed two large huts 100 feet long, and two smaller ones north of Bozkizi. Other huts (the only target) were machine gunned, and as men did not appear the 230-lb. bombs were not released. The next morning a camp of six round tents connected with the two gun emplacements half-a-mile north-east of Baba Dere was bombed, but smoke from the bombs hung over the target and prevented observation of results.At dawn on 11th June a train going north from Dedeagatch was attacked, but it sheltered under cover of anti-aircraft guns. The bombs missed by 30 and 50 yards, and our machines had wireless aerial weight shot away.Three D.H. 4&apos;s left Imbros on 12th June supported by two D.H. 4&apos;s from Lemnos one had to return before reaching objective to bomb Uzun Keupri aerodrome which was discovered during the raid of 9th June. Much damage was done, and photographs show that one hangar caught fire as a result of a direct hit and was completely destroyed. Two hostile aircraft were sighted but they did not attempt to engage.  Six Camels met and escorted our machines home.At dawn on 15th June bombs were dropped on caiques in Dedeagatch Harbour.Hostile aircraft patrol on 10th sighted enemy machine retiring from Tenedos but could not overtake it.With a view to putting an end to mine reconnaissances by the enemy between the Dardanelles and Tenedos, hands and gear were landed at Tenedos during the afternoon of 13th June, and after dark transported to the landing ground where two Camels had arrived from Imbros. During the forenoon of the 15th hostile machines were twice reported but they did not approach.At 0732 on 16th June a two-seater with scout escort was observed. A machine climbed into the sun and got between them and the Straits, but when about half a mile distant tho enemy were observed on the turn. The two hostile seaplanes dived at about 80 miles per hour towards the Straits and retired at 85 miles per hour 20 feet above the water.Attack, which was concentrated on the two-seater, was very difficult owing to slip stream, and could only be made directly from behind and above. Both Camels registered heavy bursts round the cockpits and engine, and the observer, who had been firing large calibre tracer and explosive ammunition ceased to reply, while the engine began to misfire and emit bursts of black smoke. A landing was made at high speed under the guns of Kum Kale. The scout kept close to the two-seater but would not attack, confining itself to covering the retreat. By this time fire from Kum Kale batteries was heavy and fairly accurate though bursts were too high and as one Camel had both guns jambed and the other was short of ammunition the attack was broken off.At 0720 on 18th Juno three hostile aircraft were sighted but did not approach sufficiently for attack to be practicable, and though engines were heard again at 0930 there was no further activity fill 0500 on 20th June. On sighting our machines the three hostile seaplanes on reconnais-sance dived for Bashika Burnu. They were chased at a height of 10 20 feet above the water and 100 yards from the Asiatic coast from there to Kum Kale, where one which had repeatedly been hit in the fuselage appeared to get into difficulties. The guns of the Camels had been giving trouble during the whole of the fight and eventually all jambed. Owing to the proximity of the Kum Kale guns it was inadvisable to press the attack. One of three Camels sent to intercept from Imbros reported that the damaged nostile machine landed four miles east of Kum Kale and taxied to the Asiatic coast the seaplanes are probably based at Nagara. It seems certain that, but for gun trouble, this machine would have been destroyed. Though the enemy machines were of single buy construction two at least were firing Backwards and were probably two-seaters.
A further hostile aircraft patrol at 0840 in response to report that enemy machine was proceeding from Tenedos to Lemnos failed to sight.With a view to compelling hostile aircraft to engage our machines instead of interfering with operations by keeping at a distance Gallipoli has been systematically bombed during the week ending 2nd July, attacks being made as follows: 23rd June. Day attack by three D.H.4&apos;s escorted by four Camels. A big fire was started in centre of town, and observations made during a later raid show that a large building was completely demolished. After dark a Sopwith Bomber dropped one 230-lb. bomb, but result could not be observed.25th June. One 230-lb. bomb, dropped by a D.H. 9, fell close to a large building in south-west of town and must have damaged it considerably, though smoke prevented observation. The Bomber was escorted by three Camels. After dark, the Sopwith Bomber registered a direct hit with a 230-lb. bomb on warehouses to south-west of small harbour.20th June. A DTI. 4 escorted by three Camels dropped one 230-lb. bomb which demolished a building.27th June. A D.H. 4 escorted by three Camels dropped sixteen 16-lb. bombs round docks to south-west.29th June.  A further attempt made, but machine compelled to return owing to engine trouble.Anti-aircraft fire at Gallipoli is becoming considerable but is still inaccurate.Eight hundred-weight of bombs were dropped on Seidler Bridge on the Oriental Railway on 25th June. The first bomb dropped five to ten yards from the bridge and smoke prevented further observation.Kuleli Burgas Bridge on the same railway was attacked on 27th June by three machines, a fourth having to return owing to engine trouble. A short engagement at long range took place between one machine and a hostile scout whose type could not be distinguished. The enemy followed our formation for about 15 miles on the return journey but did not again attack. Owing to necessary watch for hostile aircraft and exceedingly bumpy nature of the atmosphere, no direct hits were registered.As a result of information given by a Greek who landed at Kephalo (Imbros) on 19th June a flour mill at Keshan was bombed on the 28th June by five D.H.4 machines. A photograph taken shows the mill obscured in dust and smoke, and damage must have been considerable.Raid on Constantinople.Six D.H.9 machines, which had flown from Lemnos to Imbros the previous day, left Imbros at 0510 (G.M.T.) on 7th July with orders to bomb military objectives at Constantinople, including Haidar Pasha Railway Station, Selimiyeh Barracks, Top Khana Arsenal and Barracks, the Admiralty and Dockyards on the north side of the Golden Horn, and, if for any reason all bombs could not be dropped on these targets, any remaining were to be aimed at Makrikeui Munition Works.  Each machine carried two 65-lb. and eight 16-lb. bombs.Three Camels accompanied the formation as an escort until attack was no longer to be expected from the enemy aerodromes at Chanak and Galata and one machine which had developed radiator trouble returned with them.At Kavak one large and two small tents, which might possibly be an aerodrome, were observed but it is more likely that they form a small encampment.At Sharkeui the hospital consists of two buildings.  The crescent was shown.One observer reported a submarine at anchor and three small craft off the pier at Heraklitza on the outward journey, and again between Kutali and Aphesia on the return, but his report is not substantiated by those of other observers.Near Marmora Island was a small steamer of 1,200 tons.The formation after keeping close to the coast turned south and passed near the Princes Islands.Between Halki Island and Antigone Island were two cargo steamers of 5,000 and 3,000 tons respectively and one T.B.D., and proceeding into the Sea of Marmora from the Bosphorus were two cargo steamers of 4,000 and 1,500 tons and one large motor boat.A run was made over Haidar Pasha Railway Station where visibility was poor owing to thick ground mist and light clouds.Three 65-lb. bombs were dropped on the sidings.The best photograph taken shows that aim was good but other photographs were spoilt by the low visibility..The Railway Station contained about 500 trucks, and one train was leaving to eastward. Anti-aircraft fire was considerable and fairly accurate.Near the breakwater was a T.B.D. and two vessels like monitors besides about 50 caiques.East of the station is a camp of about 35 small and six large hutments.The machines next passed over Selemiyeh Barracks where sixteen 16-lb. bombs were dropped and direct hits were claimed on the buildings.Transport waggons were observed in the Barrack Square and about 200 soldiers were drilling on the parade ground.
IIOwing to a dense bank of cloud which extended from 4,000 to 6,000 feet, over the Pern side of the Golden Horn, the western part of Stambul and to San Stefano, the formation was broken and tho-remainder of the bombing was carried out mostly at a height of 4,000 feet when visibility made it possible;One direct hit is claimed on Top Khana Barracks (two 65-lb. bombs were dropped) and several on the Admiralty and Naval Establishments which line the north side of the Golden Horn (two 65-lb. and sixteen 16-lb. bombs dropped).A photograph shows that the bomb aimed at Stambul terminus dropped near the old SeraglioPoint.- As far as observation of the war basin was possible it seemed to contain one battleship about midway between the shores (not in the Torgup Reis old mooring) two light cruisers and five torpedo boat destroyers.Heavy and accurate anti-aircraft fire was experienced from the naval establishments. *Besides the numerous ferry and small transport boats round the entrance to the Golden Horn two tramps of about 2,000 tons were entering the outer commercial basin from the north and one of 1,500 tons from the south.Stambul terminus contained about 300 trucks and near the storehouses east of the Old Seraglio Point a 250 feet cargo steamer was berthed.Copies of a proclamation by the Ulema of Mecca, against the Young Turks supplied by the War Office for distribution were scattered mostly over Stambul.The coast batteries from Stambul to San Stefano were very active and two of our machines were hit. Fire was exceptionally good from Makrikeui, and a monitor, as long as it could keep within range, kept firing at our machines as they proceeded along the coast. In fact its fire enabled all our machines but one to get in contact and pick up formation.The remaining bombs (two 65-lb. and eight 16-lb.) were dropped, some on the munition works midway between Yedi Kule and Makrikeui where the flight leader started a fire. This is authenicated by a photograph, and others were dropped at Zeitunlik munition works where&apos;direct hits are claimed among the buildings.At San Stefano aerodrome upwards of a dozen machines were seen on the ground and two scouts were apparently waiting for our machines at 7,000 feet and one at 3,000. It is possible they could not get near enough to engage because of the thick clouds. A large yellow two-seater did attack but dived away as soon as he had received bursts from two machines which had rejoined formation.  One of our machines was hit in the tail.A storm was encountered at Ganos on the return journey. Near Xeros Island the D.H. 9 which had lost touch over Constantinople was picked up and all were joined by six Camels sent to escort back.All machines landed safely at Imbros just before 1000 and returned to Lemnos later in the day.Constantinople was again raided by six machines on 23rd July. Considerable damage was done by bombs dropped on aerodrome, Admiralty and dockyard, particularly the latter. No massing of troops was observed.As reprisals to bombing raids on Imbros an attack was made on Nagaira at dawn on 26th July and seaplanes and two aeroplanes bombed Galata during the night.  No definite result was observed.On 27th July tho basin and dockyard at Constantinople was again bombed by one aeroplane. Large fires were caused at Nagara.The above three reports are telegraphic only and will be amplified next month.ADRIATIC GROUP.    (Detailed 16th June-20th July).     (Telegraphic-26th July).At 2345 on 26th June hostile aircraft were heard approaching Alimini Lakes aerodrome from the north. The sound ceased,and was again heard a few minutes later at low altitude directly over the aerodrome. At the same time the first bombs were dropped. This procedure of gliding in with engines shut off, was followed by each enemy machine in turn.Four apparently took part and made good shooting. Twenty-one bombs were accounted for as follows: 16 small German bombs (about 16 lbs., with -shrapnel effect) and five larger bombs (One of 160 legs., and four light-case bombs of 65 kgs.). Of these, two small bombs, one 65-kg., and the 160-kg. bomb, failed to explode.-The sky was clear, and the moon was low, throwing good shadows. Owing to the fact that the aerodrome had been transferred to Andrano during the two previous days, the damage was much less than would be expected. One small bomb fell directly on the spot where the motor-workshop had stood the evening before. A second similar bomb burst outside a &quot;hut where spare engines were stored, damaging several.   A third exploded just behind a hangar, badly perforating the canvas.
Nov. ono machine, had, however, been loft, inside. The 6/i-kg. bomb which hurst about 20 yards oil: the southern hangar, slightly damaged a D..II. 4 machine, which had not yet been moved to Andrano. In addition to this, the telegraph wires wore cut in several places, and a water-cart tank was pierced.Practically all the damage was done by the small German bombs.On the following night, 27th dune, at about the same time, 2350, a further attack was made on. the aerodrome, this time by three machines carrying out the same tactics as before. Ten medium-sized bombs were dropped, and a^ considerable number of small bombs. The D.H. 4 machine damaged the previous flight, was again hit.  No personal or other material damage was done.As a reprisal to the raid on 26th June at 1.515 on the same day. four machines left Andrano with the seaplane base at Durazzo as their objective., One machine developed engine trouble and was forced to return before reaching the objective.F.3 4315 &quot; Flying Boat&quot; acted as escort.1356 lbs. of bombs were dropped by the three machines, and the western landing jetty was struck, whilst large clouds of smoke rising to a height of 150 feet were observed about 200 yards S.E. of the hangars, and close to a large dump.Two hostile boats made a very half-hearted attempt to attack. A D.H. 4 fired about 15 rounds at one of them, the shots appearing to hit, after which both turned sharply away. These machines were at an approximate height of 4,000 feet when the bombing machines arrived over Durazzo.All three I). H. 4&apos;s arrived back safely at the aerodrome by 1820.At about 0800 on 1st July hostile aircraft were reported by Saseno to be steering for Otranto. Andrano was immediately informed and two Camels left to patrol in the vicinity of Otranto, but both returned after a flight of 55 minutes without having anything to report.. On the same day, 1st July, seven D.H. 9 machines left Taranto at 0120 with the submarine base and submarine crews&apos; quarters at Gjenovic as their objective. One machine unfortunately crashed a mile from the aerodrome and one other machine was compelled to return before it had left the vicinity of the aerodrome owing to engine trouble.At 0620 four machines steering N.W. reached the objectives at an average altitude of 10,000 feet.1816 lbs. of bombs were dropped by these machines, four bombs of 112 lbs. each hitting the submarine crews&apos; quarters, and three more falling between them and the sea.One 112-lb. bomb exploded on the submarine depot ship which was afterwards seen to beon fire.One 230-lb. bomb fell close to Gjenovic submarine base, where three submarines were seen to be lying.No hostile aircraft came within range though one flying boat was seen.One of the above machines took a few photographs but through the inexperience of the gun-layer these are of no value.There were lying off the submarine base five ships, three of which were reported as being large destroyers and two of them either of the &quot;Sant Georg&quot; or &quot;Erzherog Karl&quot; class. The position of these ships is the same as when a raid was carried out on June 9th last.Only four destroyers were seen at&quot; the destroyer baseAt 0840 three machines returned and another at 1105 ; this machine landed at Galatina to check his bearings.The fifth machine developed serious engine trouble shortly before reaching the objective, and was compelled to turn south owing to rapidly losing height. The engine recovered somewhat so another attempt was made to reach the objective but again the engine failed and the machine was again forced to turn south and flew along the coast losing height all the way and passed over Durazzo at 2,300 feet. All available gear was thrown overboard to lighten the machine with the exception of Lewis gun, one pan of ammunition, revolver and ammunition. The engine, however, picked up slightly and enabled the machine to reach the S.I.A. aerodrome at Valona.Both bombs were dropped in the centre of a small village from which faint gun-flashes had been observed. . &apos;   .    .Three transports were observed proceeding south of Cape Piodoni escorted by two small destroyers.No further coastal shipping was observed owing to thick-haze.and low drifting clouds. .  One small flying boat approached from Durazzo, but on being fired at returned&apos; to harbour.Another machine, type and nationality unknown, flying at about 14,000 feet, followed for half an hour but then disappeared.At 0653 on 4th July a look-out at the Alimini Lakes aerodrome sighted a hostile machine north of the aerodrome and at a height of about 8,000 feet. Three Camels were sent up in chase but again did not come in contact with the enemy. The machine in question had probably been sent on a photographic reconnaissance. At 1702 the same day a Telefunken aircraft note was intercepted by the D.F. station.
maCO-OPERATION WITH ITALIAN OFFENSIVE IN ALBANIA.On the occasion of the Italian offensive on the Albanian front from 5th to 10th July, all available pilots and aeroplanes were placed at the disposal of General Ferrero, commanding the 16th Army Corps at Valona.Briefly, the plans for the offensive were as follows: The French and right wing of tho Italian Army wore to attack on tho morning of Saturday, July 6th, the object of the latter being Cafa Devris, a height of 3,300 feet some 20 miles E.S.E. of Berat. It was hoped to gain this objective and to draw the Austrian reserves away from the line further towards the sea. On Sunday, 7th, at 4 a.m, the main attack on the left was to take place, the objectives being:  the occupation of the Malakastra Heights, and to advance the line from the Voyusa River to the Semeui, holding bridge-heads at Fieri and Berat.The duties assigned to the British Air Unit were: (1) To destroy Kuchi Bridge, which was the sole means of the enemy&apos;s communication with Berat; (2) To observe gunfire of monitors &quot;Earl of Peterboro &quot; and &quot;Sir Thomas Picton,&quot; who were to fire on Fieri Bridge and Likovum ; (3) To bomb Tirana Aerodrome; (4) To escort the Italian bombing machines, and (5) To carry out low flying attacks with machine-gun fire on road traffic, aerodromes, etc.On Friday, 5th July, six Camels and two De Havillands (fitted with wireless) arrived from 66 Wing and landed at the Caproni Aerodrome, and on the following morning (Saturday), three De Havillands and two Camels from 67 Wing.Saturday, July 6th. At 6 a.m. Italian machines bombed Cafa Devris and were escorted by three Camels.   No hostile machines were observed.At 9*15 a.m., three D.H.9 aeroplanes, which had started from Taranto, arrived after having raided Tirana Aerodrome (to the east of Durazzo). They reported bad visibility owing to clouds, and the fall of bombs was not observed.By noon, on Saturday, Cafa Devris still remained in the enemy&apos;s hands, and was again bombed by Italian machines in the evening, escorted by three of our Camels.Six De Havillands, starting from Otranto, attacked Kuchi Bridge between 3&apos;30 p.m. and 7 p.m. in pairs. Captain J. Morrison and Observer Captain Redfern returned to Valona from this raid and reported having bombed at 15,000 feet, but just missed&apos; the bridge by a few feet with two 230-lb. bombs. Two hostile scouts had attacked them above the bridge, and Captain Redfern was severely wounded in the right thigh. The engine of this machine was also damaged by machine-gun fire, and only just managed &quot; to take them home.&quot;Shortly after, Lieutenant Chamberlain, one of the third pair to attack the bridge, landed at Valona with a failing engine. He reported that the bridge had not yet been destroyed, and that he had been attacked by two hostile scouts. Information received during the evening from Otranto showed that one D.H. (Lieutenants Anderson and Sivil) was missing.The same evening a low flying attack was made on Fieri Aerodrome, hangars and machines being fired at from 50 feet.On Sunday morning, at 4 a.m., the Italian attack on the left commenced, and at daybreak, shortly afterwards, the monitors opened fire from a position in the bay between the mouth of Voyusa and Semina Rivers. Two D.H.4&apos;s observed and spotted their fire, communication between ship and aeroplane being satisfactory. The monastery at Pojani was set on fire early in the proceedings, but the bridge at Metali, which was one of the monitors targets, was not destroyed, owing to the short time they were permitted to fire at it.The Camels were employed on escort work to Italian bombers and our spotting machines. Two H.A. were engaged and driven down, one of them possibly destroyed. Whenever possible, Camels carried out low attacks, principally on road to north of Metali Bridge.By noon, Sunday, the Italian infantry had gained most of the Malakastra Heights, and their cavalry were approaching Fieri, though meeting with a certain amount of opposition. From 3 p.m. till dark, all our available machines were employed attacking at low altitudes all troops and traffic on the road between Fieri and Lyushna, two direct hits on the road and Decauville railway being obtained with 100-lb. bombs, and many rounds fired from machine-guns from heights of 50 to 400 feet, which entirely dislocated traffic.Note. The groat moral effect on the Austrians of this form of attack (new to him on this front) was confirmed by the prisoners who on passing the aerodrome with our fighters standing out, were arguing amongst themselves and trying to identify which machine had attacked them &quot;the Red Nose,&quot; &quot;the White Nose,&quot;, or &quot;Chequers,&quot; those being some of the distinguishing&apos;marks of the Camels.In the evening the Italian cavalry entered Fieri, taking prisoners five Austrian aviators and capturing their machines, which were on the aerodrome, and in addition rescuing Lieutenants Anderson and Sivil, the pilot and observer of the D.H. missing the previous evening, whom &apos;the Austrians had left behind in Fieri Hospital.   Lieutenant Sivil was suffering from a severe wound
On Sunday evening, thereforo, the Italians were in possession of Fieri, though they still encountered opposition at Metali Bridge from an onomy machino gun post on the hills to tho north of the bridge.   The situation to the south of Berat was still indefinite.On Monday morning, two D.H.&apos;s from Otranto made a most determined low attack (800 and 1,000 foot respectively) on Kuchi Bridge and each obtained a direct hit with a 100-lb. bomb, at the same time taking a photo of the damage which indicated clearly that the bridge was now useless. Lieutenant Straffird and Observer A. M. Wallace, and Lieutenant Bragg and Observer Lieutenant Lindner, carried out this operation in a most courageous and praiseworthy manner, tho latter pair landing at Valona with their camera to have the negative developed.The destruction of this bridge, which was the sole means of communication with Berat, rendered it possible for the Italians to advance on Berat, and in the afternoon a reconnaissance carried out by a D.H. showed no traffic on the roads between Fieri and Lyushna or Kuchi and Berat, beyond 14 motor lorries to the north of Berat moving slowly north, probably with wounded.This D.H. dropped a 230-lb. bomb on the working party employed clearing away wreckage on Kuchi Bridge; the bomb dropped 20 yards away in the water.On Tuesday, no special operations were required by our machines, and tho time was spent overhauling engines and repairing wings, etc., damaged by machine-gun fire. In the evening a reconnaissance carried out by an Italian machine showed the roads south of Lyushna were deserted and a large fire, presumably of stores, was observed in the town.General Ferrero then gave permission for the return of all British machines, signifying also his entire satisfaction with their work, which had very materially assisted the success of his operations.The Italian cavalry and armoured cars had by Tuesday evening pressed on along the south bauk of the Semini River and had occupied Kuchi Bridge, thus cutting off Berat completely.It therefore remained to clear up any isolated positions in and around Berat, and this was in progress on Wednesday morning, when the British machines returned to their bases, leaving behind the two wouuded officers, Captain Redfern and Lieutenant Sivil, who were being well cared for by the Italians, and were progressing satisfactorily. A party of two officers and eight men also remained to repair three damaged machines.Altogether during these operations, some three tons of bombs have been dropped, and about 3,000 rounds of ammunition fired at low altitudes and a mileage flown about 10,000.Raid on Gattaro, July 17th.Four machines from Taranto carried out a successful raid on Cattaro on 17th July. They carried a weight of 1,816 lbs. of bombs which were dropped at the submarine base and submarine crews&apos; quarters at Gjenovic.The explosion of three of the bombs can be seen in a photograph of the road between the base and quarters.Three hostile aircraft were encountered but driven off, one of which was believed to go down out of control.   Anti-aircraft fire was heavy and fairly accurate. .   .Two machines flew to and landed at Valona with slight engine trouble, but returned to Taranto later, the other two machines landing at Brindisi (as arranged) at 0820 and 1670; one machine flew back to Taranto later, the other crashing at Brindisi on landing.At 0420, on 17th July, a message was received from Italian sources that hostile aircraft had been heard. The position given was 410 56&apos; N., 1.20 06&apos; E., but this was stated to be doubtful. Accordingly two Camels patrolled in the vicinity of Otranto for an hour without, however, sighting any hostile machines.On 21st July, four D.H. 4 machines from Otranto carried out an attack on Cattaro. Three machines and the escorting seaplane have returned. The fourth machine is missing and was possibly shot down. A machine was seen falling in flames, but whether it was ours or hostile is not known. Others report three Austrian &quot;Novarra&quot; class cruisers, one Austrian &quot;Erzherzog Karl&quot; class battleship, seven or eight destroyers at original base, and eleven submarines, one in vicinity of submarine quarters. Anti-aircraft fire was very heavy and six hostile scouts attacked. Only two photographs were obtained as all machines were being continually attacked whilst bombing. All submarines had submerged by the time the last machine had passed over.  (Telegraphic report only.)On 24th July, three D.H.4 machines from Taranto carried out a further raid on Cattaro. A direct hit with one 112-lb. bomb on the stern of an Austrian &quot;Erzherzog Karl&quot; class was obtained and seven 112-lb. bombs were dropped on buildings near submarine quarters. Machines were heavily attacked by eight enemy machines and heavy anti-aircraft fire, but all returned safely. Usual shipping activity observed and six submarines seen.   (Telegraphic report only.)On 26th July, at the request of the Italian Commander-in-Chief, Albania, six D.H. 4 machines from Otranto escorted by three Camels, carried out a bombing raid on Austrian Headquarters at Ragosina, near Skumbi River, Albania. The raid was very successful and several very large fires were started and great quantities of stores destroyed. All machines returned safely. (Telegraphic report only.)
