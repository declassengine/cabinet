&apos; 1/DOGUI/IClfT to m\ IWTWY OJ- HIS ftifc&amp;IWIC LkJDoTY1b GOTOMiTO).R B T,&apos;-5906,Memorandum bfy Sir Kftwia Cornwall.1*     I regret that I was prevented by illness from being pre sent at the various meetings of the Home affairs Committee of the Cabinet at which the proposed Bill for the establishment of a Linistry of Health was discussed,,   I have nov- carefully considered the draft Bill as sent on by the Committee to the War Cabinet, and I think it desirable to send this short Memorandum calling attention to certain considerations which appear to rne to be ox some importance,Ea     The most important proposal of the Bill is to transfer the whole work of national Health Insurance from the Department which is now responsible for its administration, to another Department differently constituted, of whoso work it will form only a subsidiary part,3,     I therefore think it necessary to call attention to tho scope and character of the work of National Health Insurance- the nature of the local machinery by which it is administered throughout the United kingdom, and the arrangements which were made by Parliament in 1911 for the supervision of the work on behalf of the Central Government04.     The scheme of National Health Insurance covers practically the whole of the workers through the United Kingdom, to the number of some 15 millions.     The funds are derived from weekly contributions paid by the employed persons and their employers, and a proportion of the cost of all the benefits is provided by the Exchequer.   In the year 1916 the contributions&apos; of employers and employed amounted to about  18,500,000, and the Exchequer subvention to about  5,000,000* The sums disbursed in the &quot;same year as benefits were as followsSickness and Disablement benefit ....  6,000,000Medical Services.....................  4,800,000Ivlate mity belief it.....................  1,250,000Sanatorium benefit..................-. 750,0005..     The cash benefits are administered by some 1,700 Approved Societies with 10,000 Branches, each having its o--n fund under its own control,,   These societies are self-governed, and are justly proud and jealous of their independence and autonomy.   In a very large proportion of cases, side by side with the state Insurance work, they carry on also a scheme of sickness insurance based on voluntary contributions from their members,   such schemes are closely interwoven with the compulsory state scheme/of Insurance, are ordinarily administered by the seme staff and through the same machinery, and form an invaluable supplement to the state scheme in the interests of thrift and of the national health.6.     The medical side of National. Health Insurance is administeredlocally by bodies, known as Insurance Committees, speciallyset up for the purpose in every County and County Borough.A general supervision of the whole work, both of Approved Societiesand Insurance Committees, on behalf of the Central Government isexercised
exorcised through Government Departments, known as Insurance Commissions, set up for each part of the United Kingdom under a Minister directly responsible to Parliament for the work of National Health Insurance.   These Commissions as set up in 1011 were given a constitution at once interesting and unique.   They included representatives of the Societies of various types through which the scheme wos to be administered, with the object of ensuring that the central control of the work of those Societies would be in tlx-hands of persons familiar with their special circumstances and traditions.   It is difficult to say at this juncture what the loss of this method of dealing with the complex working of haticnal Health Insurance would ultimately lead to.7.    It may be said that the proposed Bill does not touch in any way tho local machinery of hational Health Insurance. There can, however, be no doubt that one of the earliest of the changes which would be made by the new Ministry, if set up, would be to transfer the medical side of Insurance to the Local Sanitary Authorities, thus involving the abolition of Insurance Committees. This step would in turn-weaken the close connection which at present exists between the cash side of the scheme as administered by Approved Societies, and the medical side, and so would re-act on the work of the Societies.   Furthermore, the introduttion of the municipal and local authority organisations Would connect Insurance with other social problems and raise difficulties as to the relation between the services due to the payment of insurance contributions and services extended to other sections of the community not paying such contributions.   This might easily be a first step in the undermining of the present contributory system of insurance,  and would probably lead to a demand for. the ......complete abolition of such a system.,8.    It must be remembered that National health Insurance is subject to valuation.   This valuation, but for the V/ar, would have taken plaoe before now, and until the first valuation has been made and the results-made known, parliament and the public generally will not have a clear understanding of the actual position, financial and otherwise, of the Insurance Acts 1911-18,  and I doubt very much whether it is in the best public interest to transplant the organisation before this valuation has taken place.9.    I am a..are that the Minister of Reconstruction has had interviews with representatives of the Societies and has reached a measure of agreement with them.    I had, however, myself been receiving representations from these saae organisations for some time previously, ana the attitude which they always took up with&apos; me was that a Ministry of Health would only be acceptable to them if it were entirely free from the Local Government Board., and if national Health Insurance were retained as an integral part of the Ministry. /I append, to this homo ran dum a copy of a document which 7/as submitted to me last year by a Committee of influential representatives of Societies of all types who had given the most careful and prolonged oonsideration t - the question.-10.    It w.,uld appear that the representatives of the Societies have modified&apos;their views very considerably as the result of their discussions with tho Minister e-f Reconstruction, and it is.pr -bable that these bodies will consequently be less likely to -ipposc the Government proposals.   At the same time 1 fear that there will be no little disappointment when the previsions of the proposed Bill become generally kn-..wn.m    2    -11. It is
11,     It is, of oourse, solely from the point of view of National Health Insurance that I have made these observations, I recognise that other members of the Government may consider that the wider national interests of public health outweigh the considerations which I have urged.(Sd.)
