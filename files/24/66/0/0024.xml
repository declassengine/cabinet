&quot;r----1       His Britannic Ma]esty&apos;s Government.)1% Political Intelligence Do ;it ent,Confidential.FOREIGN OFFICE-October 9th, 1918,Spain /005.fh^&apos;-  ^^P\ MEMORANDUM ONrCOHDITIOHS IU SPATS.H^UM^ ^*Every day life becomes more impossible in Spain;   thedearnass of food has reached an incredible height, and neither the Ministry of Supply nor the municipalities have done any-thing to remedy this deplorable state of affairs.     The rise in prices without any justification is trctly scandalous.     The price of many articles of prime necessity has doubled.     Only the rich can now obtain meat, sugar, oil, fish, potatoes, rioe and fruit ........     In the meantime, the Government is planningvast projects while Spaniards actually are dying &amp;E hunger be-cause they are unable materially to feed themselves.     How leng is this dangerous and lamentable - state of affairs going ta last?&quot;This quotation from the leading article in the moderate &quot;Oorrespondencia de EspaSa&quot; of the  5th September shsws the agitation which is now going on owing to the encrmous rise in prices... &apos;   The food situation has been rapidly getting wars a.. As far back as the ebginning cf June the Tay^r of Madrid, SeSor - Silvela, resigned owing to his inability to obtain facilities from the Bank of-&quot;o&apos;?ain fcr requisitioning wheat.     His action drew attention to the matter and the Government intervened to obtain the necessary facilities.     About the same time a decree was signed by the King for the requisitioning of the whole mer-chant fleet for the necessities of the nation.     In July a bill was introduced providing for increased pay for civil servants, as these had followed the lead of the Army in demanding higher salaries to meet the increased expense of living.A strike in the Asturian coalfields was narrowly averted-1- /and
and a settlement arrived at.     Strike notices were issued in the Poifarroya eoal-raines and a strike was threatened in the Altos Homos Iron foundries at Bilbao.    By August, demonstrations and bread riots were taking place at Muroia, Calatayud, Cartagena, Guadal&amp;jgra, Malaga, Castellon;   in Galicia, the Balearic Is-lands, Jerez, Palenoia, Saragoza, Valladolid and Granada.     In Guadalajara the high price an? bad quality of the bread led to rioting, resulting in loss of liie, after the Civil Governor had refused to requisition corn.     In the iron and load mines of the Cartagena district 12,000 miners were out.     Strikes v/ere also begun in the iron-mines of Aimeria, in the building trade of Toledo, and among the dockers of Malaga and Huelva, especially those engaged in loading iron pyrites.     At Jerez martial-law . had to be proclaimed.     General strikes were proclaimed at Seville, Ciudad Real, Lebrija, Palencia and Badalona.Towards the end of the month newspapers &quot;began to note the peculiar features of many of these strikes, their spasmodic character and their disavowal by the Socialist leaders (&quot;Diario Universal&quot;, August 26th, &quot;Vanguard!a&quot;and &quot;Correspondencia de Espan*aV August 27th).     The strikes at Seville, Saragoza and Jerez, for instance, took place without the intervention of the labour organisations.     The &quot;Diario Universal&quot; (Aurust 22nd) and the &quot;Pais,T (August 27th) declared that foreigners were tak-ing advantage of the general discontent among the labouring classes to foment strikes and demonstrations for their own pur-poses.     The &quot;Socialista&quot; (August 24th) admitted and condemned the intervention of foreign agents.     The majority of the strikes was in mines and districts producing material for the Allies and it is easy, therefore, to see the nationality of the foreign agents who are said to have fomented the disturbances.At the end of August, provision shops and warehouses were being looted at Tugo.     A day or two afterwards the office of-2- /Commissioner
nn-wrami pel oner of wir/Sly was raised to tho rank of a Ministry. The farmers passed?reSolutions taaanding local Food Boards and the requisitioning &apos;*f the flour mills and a general strike in the Rio Tinto mines was threatened, the minors demanding an in-creaso of 50$ in their1 wagos.A perusal of tho Spanish press for the last week in Sept-ember and the first few days in October shows that similar oon-ditions exist &quot;aver the whole of Spain,     Strikes are taking.-, place or are threatened in a multiplicity of places and a variety of trades.    T6, take a few instanOoo:   the ceal-minej*s of Puertollano (strike new settled), the iron-workers and &quot;bakers of Barcelona, the textile-workers of Arenys do Funt, the hair-dressers of Tarragona, the bakers of Almeria, the agricultural labourers of Huelva, the metal-workers of Santander, the shoe-makers of Torralavega, the railwaymen of Andalucia, the tramway-men of Granada, the shipwrights of Valencia, the cabmen, cooks and waiters of Madrid, the railwayman of Cviodo., the guilders of Seville, the gas-workers of Cerdoba, the sweet-makers &amp;f Saragoza, and the hat-makers of Granada.That tho Republicans are ready to take advantage y.f the prevailing unrest appears to be the oase from a letter written &quot;by the Republican leader, Soifor lerroux, to one of his supporters and recently reproduced in tho Madrid press.     &quot;I think&quot;, he writes, &quot;that the hour is nigh of which I have spoken and no-body can challenge my right to my opinion.     T.am praying for it so that I may again unfurl the hattle-flag&apos;of. tho Radical Party and persuade the country that in the -present state of disorder in which so many things are &quot;being shipwrecked and the wholo nation may founder, there are men, there are forces, there are possible solutions and there is oven hope that Spain may be re-deemed and survive tho oatastrophe.&quot;To-day more than ever, while thinking of tho resurrectIon-3- . /of
of our country, a Republic beocmes possible because this country of ours with a monarchy would not be a real country, but first -of all be the property of oligarchied, and finally some l?cwer would come al^ng and colonise us and place us in the ijtfeTior position of a subject race.&quot;A Democratic Radical Republio governed with an iron hand, which Would impose lav/ and justice and maintain order, would save us all;   that is the revolution of which I speak.&quot;On the top of this and before the question of the tor-pedoeing cf Spanish ships by German-submarines has been settled comes the news of a Cabinet crisis at a most inopportune moment before the Cortea have been re-opened - the Cortes from which three of the parties of tho Left absented themselves after the passage of the Law of Espionage, and to which they have not yet returned.
