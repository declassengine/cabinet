V 7 7 UTranslation of a telegram from the FrenchiMinister at^jfiirneHbo Th(T1?rench CoTerTiment dated OctoTor,4^1918.(Communicated by M.Clemenceau to the Prime Minister.)Tho retired German Artillery General, Yon Roehl, formerly commanding the 9th Corps,, has arrived at Lucerne to meet his son, who has up to now been interned at Engelberg, and has for some days boon attached to the Imperial Legation at Berlin^   A cousin of the General, quite recently wounded before Verdun, and authoris-ed to undergo a cure in Switzerland, has joined these two officers. The following is the essential part of the information they have given:-   The German retreat, according to the information of Von Roehl, who professes to have, this information from G.H*Q,., is due principally to the la^k of material.     Guns^ naohine-guns, and munitions have been taken by the enemy in so large quantities that it is impossible to replace them.   The lack of raw materials,, which had already appreciably slowed down the production of material before the battles offspring, eonpels the Army to a great economy and weighs heavily on the decisions of the command.Another cause of the retreat, according to General Von Roehl, to use his own phrase, is the discontent of Officers and the demor-alisation of the troops-.    &quot;Human material is lacking&quot;, says the General, &quot;but the Army nas lost confidence.   The mon perceive that the enemy artillery is many times superior to ours in number;   the aeroplanes, which-fly quite low, distract them;   the Tanks, of which the enemy seems to have a great number, inspire thorn with such fear, that they become irresolute;   a rigorous effort of the High Command would be necessary to take them in hand again.&quot;So far as concerns the Emperor, General Von Roehl indicates that recent reverses have definitely upset his health.   He does not sleep, and he is a prey to outbreaks of tears, from which he emerges exhausted and without will powor0   He speaks more and more of abandoning!   power in tho hope that his abdication will render loss severe the conditions imposed on Germany by the Allies.   He recently said to his&apos; son, who repeated it to his entourage; &quot;We will leave together, our enemies wanting you no more than they de me.u   In these crises of distress ho wishes:to be killed at the head of his regiment.   The Emperor has never spoken to his en^our*-age of his succession, but in the Bavarian Court one puts forwsfird more and more the name of the King of Bavaria as one who ought to obtain the Imperial Crown.   Does not Bavaria possess the civilisa-tion much older than that of Prussia?   Has it not given $mperors to Germany?The three Officers show themselves very irritated by the liberty which has been given to the Press;   they reproach it particularly with painting the future in the most sombre colours with an interested aim.   According to them this is no more than a political manoeuvre intended to discredit all those who have been in power since the beginning of the *7ar, as well as the High Command, with the object of obtaining the democratio reforms which the people demand.     &quot;We must come to that at least,&quot; said theGeneral
General in a melancholy manner, nin order to pick up the (grcj miss in?.;) and the discipline. It is a sad affair which runs &quot; risk of shokinr&quot; the foundations of the Imperial edifice. But it appears to be unavoidable no^. However .this may be,&quot; he added, &quot;I have an absolute confidence in the patriotism of the German people., The day on which it perceives that it fightsr more for conquests, but that the existence of the very country at stake, it will apply itself to defend its frontiers and will fight to the end.&quot;VERSAILLES,6th October, 1918.
