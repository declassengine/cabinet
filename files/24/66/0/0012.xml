IECLARATICivT OF THE NAT 10ML EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE FOR THECOMPLETE REPARATION QF MTAGE CAUSED BY THE WAR.(Comite   National d1Action pour le Reparation des doranages causer, par le Guerre)(dession of the Board 13th Septo 1918.)The attention Of the abbve Committee in accordance with its instruct tions has been directed since the beginning of the War to the aoto of destruction, devastation, confiscation, pillage, requisitions and forced contributions which had been carried on without any reasons of military necessity, in the invaded territories and which, in spite of the universal horror and condemnation arousefl, thereby in the whole civilised world, continue to increaso and become intensifiedtThese iniquitous proceedings which revive the memory Qf ages long forgotten, and which are contrary to the most elemental concep-tions of international law:   this Economic exploitation of War, as the ifermans themselves dare to term their mTliTary&quot;&quot;0perations which transform warfare into a detestable system of Purglary (Cambriplage), having for its aim the agricultural, industrial and &quot;commercial ruin of the invaded country;   all these must have had official sanction. The sanction $f crimes and acts of violence carefully premeditated and minutely thought out in. all their details, and carried out cruelly and in cold blood are nft less monstrouo than the crimes them-selvescThe ancient principle of the lex^tali^nis^, however repugnant it may seem to nations fighting for&quot;thV&quot;&apos;supremacy of Justice, Right&apos; and Liberty, is nevertheless the only one that in the present oircum-stances can appeal to a nation which has deliberately placed itself outside the paie of civilisation and which is admittedly in a state of retrogression.     On the other hand this principle will leave unprejudiced, for action at the proper time, all prlitical and legal obligations, pecuniary and penal, collective and individual, which Governments and private citizens may desire to put into force,,..In these circumstances, and considering the unwarrantable aggravation of this scientific savagery, the old law of an Eye for an Eye and a Tooth for a Tooth is the only law which can put an &quot;end to the abominable ^conception of War entertained by the Germans,The National Committee, on behalf of the interests which it is defending, therefore calls upon the Governments whose peoples are engaged in this Modern Crusade, t-&apos; announce their solemn and formal resolve to put into practice the modernised leaJBalionij. Town for Town, Visage. for^Viilage, , Church for Church, Cgatoau, for Chateau. -EgfratofcjslffiHtfiTe;.- Tt is aTofaTiation which the modern barbarians&quot;&quot;&quot;have brought&quot; upon themselves, and is the only formula which oan make any impression on hearts and minds impervious to any other sentiment than that inspiwd by the fear of a terrible and swift punishment. *
