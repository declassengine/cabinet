HAYES FISHER.*Local Government Board, 1th October, 1918.PUBLIC HEALTH.In the following notes I venture to submit a few considerations concerning Public Health suggested by the Bill for the constitution of the Ministry of Health and Local Government.1. The administrative control of Public Health is, as in the case of many other subjects, divided between Authority at the centre and Authority at the circumference. The Central Government is possessed of certain directing and controlling powers, the Local Authorities are the executive machinery which puts the powers of government into actual execution. The Bill is confined to the province of the Central Government and in that sphere does not attempt to do more than to place in one Government Department certain functions of the central administration which are at present in the hands of several Departments. It does not add to or vary those functions and it in no way touches the local organisations. It recognises, as everyone must recognise, that in whatever way the business of Govern-ment is divided between Departments, whether by subjects or geographically, whether industrially or socially, whether by age groups or by some other way, a certain amount of overlapping is inevitable. It is impossible to isolate every subject from every other. All that can be done is to keep in mind broad principles of sub-division and by the ordinary comity of relationship between Departments to arrive at convenient working arrange-ments for the avoidance of trouble in cases where overlapping occurs. Obviously, when a change takes place it should be, wherever possible, in the direction of decreasing and not increasing overlapping and this is the object of the present Bill.2. It may be convenient for a moment to inquire into the nature of the overlapping which now exists. When the Local Government Board was formed in 1871, in accordance with the recommendation of the Sanitary Commission, the intention was, as stated in a preamble of the Act, &quot;To concentrate in one department of the Government.the super-vision of the laws relating to the public health, the relief of the poor and local government.&quot; The Local Government Board was thus set up to be a Ministry of Health and Local Government. I need not here dilate on the development of Public Health administration which has taken place under its guidance and through the agency of the great system of Local Government. It has been progressive and continuous and as a result the span of human life has been lengthened and mortality rates have been enormously reduced. * Until the present century little or no overlapping in matters of health took place. But of recent years the conception of the term &quot; public health &quot; has by common consent been widened, and the view has come to. be accepted that not only is it the duty of the State to promote conditions favourable to health but that the health of each individual in the community is a national asset, which it is worth the State&apos;s while to maintain. As a result it has happened that in recent years the State, in a variety of ways, gentrally and&apos; locally, has taken steps for securing the proper medical treatment for its citizens. Medical and sanatorium benefit under the Insurance Acts for insured persons, the treatment of; scholars by the Education Authorities, the provision of sanatoria,&apos; of dispensaries, of venereal disease clinics, and all the growing work of maternity and child &quot;welfare&quot; ale&quot; all1&apos;&apos; manifestations of the same tendency, but by accident or caprice these-various &quot;subjects^* The returns published in the Annuaire International de, Statistique show that&apos;the average length of male life (expectation of life at birth) was 51&quot;5 years in England and Wales, which is higher than in any other country, except Scandinavia. The most recent corresponding figures for Germany, Austria, France, Italy and Switzerland are 47*4, 407, 45*7, 47&apos;0 and 49-3 years respectively.(b 1430)   Wt.      -g629   150   10/18  H&amp;S
have not been co-ordinated, but have been placed under the control of separate Depart-ments. The immediate object of a Ministry of Health and Local Government Bill is to bring into the hands of one Minister the scattered threads of this particular section of Public Health administration so that he may be in a position to direct its future develop-ment.3. Some of the utterances that have been made and the paragraphs that have been written on the subject of a Ministry of Health would lead one to suppose that health had been entirely neglected in this country and that the Ministry was needed to bring our standards up to the ordinary levels of modern civilisation. This is altogether unfounded, for in Public Health administration England has always been the pioneer, and still leads the way. A good deal has also been made of the amount of disability amongst adults, revealed by the medical examinations under the Military Service Acts. No doubt the amount is large and much of it may be classed as preventable. But it must be remembered firstly that a certain proportion of the physical defects which disable a man for military service do not prevent him from civil life and occupation. And, more important, the examination has been that of men born some 20 to 40 years ago. Since that day remarkable progress has been made and it is perfectly certain that if the children of to-day were subjected 20 to 40 years hence to a similar examination they would yield a far more satisfactory result. A death rate diminished by nearly 50 per cent, in ages up to 40 during the past half century is pretty good evidence of this assertion. Never-theless, in Public Health there can be no standing still; the war against disease and its causes is unending and the successful results of the last half century of work are but an inspiration towards further efforts.4, I have referred to the unification of central control being needed in order to direct the future development of Public Health policy, particularly in relation to the treatment of the individual. The present situation certainly invites a survey of the prospect before us. Under the present system the State (or the local bodies acting under it) makes itself responsible for the treatment of a very large amount of individual sickness. But the present arrangements are not only under different systems of central and local control, but are partial and patchy. Some diseases are dealt with and others are not, some sections of the population are entitled to the treatment and others are not, and the quality and extent of the treatment, where given, varies. The tendency of the past 15 years is bound to continue and the immediate problem which faces us is whether we are prepared to establish a universal system of medical treatment available for the whole population just as education is available. If the recommendations of Sir Donald Maclean&apos;s Committee, [see Cd. Paper 8917] are accepted, it means that the Government commits itself to this principle. For if the treatment of the sick poor is to be undertaken as a Public Health service and the title to the treatment is not indigence or &quot; destitution,&quot; but ill-health, it follows that treatment cannot be refused to anyone who is sick, be his means or social position what they may. And the process must extend both to domiciliary and institutional treatment.5. To achieve this end necessitates the devising of a scheme of considerable magni-tude involving some serious problems. First and foremost is the part which the doctors are to play. It is evident that no scheme which does not enlist the support and appro-bation of the medical profession could succeed. There are manifest signs already that the profession is beginning to think round the problem of mobilising itself for this service, and the establishment of a Medical Advisory Council under the Ministry of Health and Local Government Bill may be of great asssistance in this connection. Another great question relates to the local machinery. Local administration is absolutely essential and it would be madness to set up an organisation separate and divorced from that of the Public Health Authorities. The preventive and the curative side of Public Health must be brought more closely together and their interrelation recognised more distinctly than in the past. So also must*the professional and the administrative elements be harmonised so far as this is possible. It will not be satisfactory&apos; if either the Ministry of Health and Local Government or the local organisations are wholly dominated by doctors and experts, or are left to the sole guidance of official advisers. Amongst other questions which actually arise are the following:-Is the scheme to be gratuitous or partly contributory; the relation between domiciliary and institution treatment; the use of specialist services; the position of voluntary hospitals; the effect of the scheme on State Insurance, &amp;c. Besides all this there is the great problem of finance.
6. Wide as is the range of the curative side of Public Health, the preventive side is still more far reaching and no single Ministry can hope to cover it all. The improvement in the health of the race which we hope to see will be compassed not solely by hospitals and by sanitation, but also by education, by the development of new ideas, by new standards of comfort, by better conditions of employment and housing, by the spread of temperance, and of saner and cleaner views of life.7. The questions connected with what is known as the Reform of the Poor Law have been dealt with in another memorandum by Mr. A. V. Symonds, and I need not refer to them here, further than to say that they certainly involve difficult questions of local government and of social policy which cannot be avoided if the matter is touched at all. Public assistance covers much more than mere Poor Law relief; it must be locally administered after local investigation, and co-ordinated action by the various agencies engaged in it is much to be desired. So much of it is necessarily concerned with the relief of sickness that it cannot be disentangled from other branches of Public Health and consequently Sir Donald Maclean&apos;s Committee have recommended that Poor Law should pass to the Public Health Authorities. If this course is ,adopted and Public Health and public assistance are, because of their intimate interrelation, to be in the hands of one Authority for local administration, it seems almost grotesque to suggest at the same moment that they should be treated for the purpose of the Central Government not merely as separable subjects but as subjects which cannot be allowed to be dealt with by one and the same Ministry.8. The establishment of a Ministry of Health and Local Government will serve as an opportunity for reviewing the past and surveying the future, for inaugurating the plans of the new campaign, and for formulating a new policy. It will also, no doubt, do much to quicken public interest in a matter of great public concern. The problems which lie before it are, as I have endeavoured to show, big and far reaching. But the more they are ventilated and discussed the better, so that when the time comes for legislation on these subjects, the Ministry may have the driving force of public opinion behind it.H. C. MONRO.Local Government Board, October, 1918.
SOME NOTES ON POOR  LAW  REFORM  AND THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL&apos;.Poor Law Reform is overdue. The need for a complete reorganisation of the existing system has long been recognised by all but those who for various reasons cling to the traditions of the past. The social legislation of the last decade has progressively limited the functions of the present Poor Law Authorities and transferred to other authorities, both local and national, powers and duties in connection with public assistance in the widest sense of that term; and in the new order of things to which the country is looking forward after the war there will, be no place for the old Poor Law. Hitherto the driving power necessary to secure the passage of a &quot;comprehensive measure of Poor Law Reform has been lacking. It may now, however, be looked for in the movement which has led to the demand for the establishment, of a Ministry of Health.The object of this Memorandum is to show how intimately these two questions are connected, and to emphasise the importance from this point of view of the general principles underlying the recommendations of the Local Government Committee of the Ministry of Reconstruction on the transfer of functions of Poor Law Authorities. Further, it is hoped that if, as is not improbable, the Government are challenged on the intro-duction of the Ministry of Health and Local Government Bill to declare their future policy and procedure in regard to these matters, the suggestions contained in this Memorandum may be of some use in supplying a possible answer.It will be remembered that the Home Affairs Committee have already come to the conclusion that some declaration of policy in regard to Poor Law Reform must be made on behalf of the Government at the appropriate stage of the Ministry of Health and Local Government Bill, and an attempt is made in these notes to examine the real significance and consequences of such a declaration, and the steps to be taken in order to give practical effect to it.1. The cardinal principles underlying the recommendations of the Local Goverti-ment Committee, presided over by Sir Donald Maclean, were-(1) that the functions of the Poor Law Authorities should, be transferred to the County and County Borough Councils; and (2) that the Poor Law itself should disappear and that provision should be made for the performance of the services at present rendered under the Poor Law by means of an application and extension of the Public Health, Education, Lunacy and. other Acts.2. It would have been easier, and at one time it might have been practicable, to approach the problem by two stages and to make a beginning with a transference of administrative powers alone, postponing the unification of services until actual experience of a system of unified administration led to a spontaneous movement in the direction of unifying the services. But, whatever may be said in favour of such procedure, it will be agreed that it is not now practicable. It would not satisfy the Poor Law reformers, and the last chance of its success has been destroyed by the result of the negotiations in regard, to the Ministry of Health and Local Government Bill.3. It must be presumed therefore that Poor Law Reform as now understood implies the acceptance of both the principles enunciated above, and it will be well to consider in the first place what opposition Poor Law Reform in this sense will probably encounter and what support it will be likely to receive. 04. It will, of course, be strenuously opposed by the Poor Law Authorities, and it would be imprudent to underestimate the strength of this opposition. It will probably be opposed by the Rural District Councils, who are to a considerable extent identical with the Boards of Guardians. It may be opposed by the smaller Uroan authorities and some of the Metropolitan Borough Councils.5. On the other hand it will be supported by persons in all parties who are anxious to see a development in social services, and by those who look upon it. as a necessary concomitant of the project of a Ministry of Health. It will probably be supported by the Association of Municipal Corporations, and possibly by the County Councils Associa-(o 1429)  Wt.      -g629   150  10/18  H &amp; S
tion. It has been made one of the principal planks in the programme.of the Labour Party. It will be supported by the bulk of the medical profession, and of what are called the &quot; Insurance interests.&quot;6. It may be added that without a promise of Poor Law Reform it would be very difficult to carry a Ministry of Health Bill, and almost impossible to carry such a Bill in a form which contemplated that the Local Government Board should be the nucleus of the Ministry ; and, lastly, that it cannot be gainsaid that there does exist a widespread and bitter prejudice against the Poor Law, and that the popularity and therefore the usefulness of the Local Government Board are in some degree impaired by the Depart-menfs association with it.ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY.7. The question of the administrative machinery involved in any scheme of Poor Law Reform, such as that advocated by Sir D. Maclean&apos;s Committee, will call for careful examination by experts in Poor Law and Local Government generally. The chief difficulties will probably be found to arise in connection with (1) the position of the minor local authorities in the scheme; (2) the. problem of London and the surrounding areas ; (3) the principle of co-option ; and (4) the financial consequences of the transfer. These difficulties cannot be resolved without reference to the future health policy of the country,, and accordingly they cannot be left out of consideration in any discussion arising out of the project for a Ministry of Health and Local Government. But for the sake of brevity these questions will be dealt with separately in an Appendix to this Memorandum (Appendix A).THE POSSIBILITY OF TRANSFERRING THE HEALTH SERVICES IN ADVANCE OF OTHER FUNCTIONS OF POOR LAW AUTHORITIES.8. The Maclean Committee contemplated the simultaneous transference of, all the functions of the Poor Law Authorities, and it may be doubted whether a single member of the Committee would have assented to a proposal to transfer the health functions apart from, and in advance of, the remaining functions of the Boards of Guardians. On the other hand, several members insisted that the Report should be regarded as only an instalment of a comprehensive scheme for the reform of the Avhole of public assistance [cf. Memoranda of Mr. Curtis and Mr. Montagu Harris), while Sir R. Morant assumed that before any transference took place &quot; the necessary extension by Parliament and by the Government Departments of the various Acts and arrangements relating to &quot;the health of the people should have been completed.&quot;9. The force of circumstances, in particular the circumstances surrounding the intro-duction of the Ministry of Health and Local Government Bill, may compel us to give priority to the question of Poor Law Reform, but it would be barely practicable, and even if practicable, most unwise to attempt to transfer the medical services of the Poor Law Authorities without at the same time transferring their remaining functions.10. Such an attempt would be resented by the most prominent advocates of Poor Law Reform. Those persons who are chiefly interested in the welfare of children would be sure to press that the care of children should be transferred simultaneously with the care of the sick, and they could, with truth, contend that the problem of transferring to the Education Authorities the functions of the Guardians in respect to the care cf children admitted of a simpler solution than the problem of transferring the medical services ; while those who are mainly interested in the question of the unemployed able-bodied would object more strenuously than ever to leaving this class within an unreformed Poor Law.11. On the other side the Poor Law Authorities themselves would, it is certain, contest any scheme for depriving them of their medical services quite as keenly as they would resist proposals for their total abolition.12. But even if this were not so, the severance of the medical from the remaining functions of the Boards of Guardians appears to present almost insuperable difficulties. It has to be remembered that, of the factors which combine to make up present-day pauperism, sickness is by far the largest and the most important. Take away the treat-ment of sickness, and you leave the Guardians with institutions,- staff and other liabilities far in excess of their requirements. In the whole of England and Wales, out of 636 Unions, only 54 possess separate infirmaries, and of these 54, 26 are Metropolitan Unions.
It is true that in addition 33.1 Unions possess buildings set apart for sick persons, but these buildings are under the same control and generally within the same curtilage as the Workhouse. The remaining 251 Unions have no accommodation for sick persons apart from the Workhouse. In these cases, if the institutions are left to the Guardians and the sick removed, they will be too large for their purpose. If they are taken away from the Guardians other institutions will have to be provided, and, further, to be provided merely for the transitional period pending the transfer of the Guardians&apos; remaining functions. It has sometimes been proposed to leave the Workhouses to the Guardians and to take away the separate infirmaries. This would be grossly unfair to the most progressive Boards of Guardians, who have provided these institutions, and, as indicated above, it would only be operative in a comparatively few cases.13. There is a further objection of- a quite different, but in the opinion of many, of a not less serious nature. Lord George Hamilton and those of his colleagues who signed the Majority Report of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws, in criticising the scheme of the Minority, pointed out that &quot;the many and subtle problems associated with public assistance, especially when it is a family rather than an individual that requires re-habilitation, cannot be solved by the simple process of sending off each unit to a separate authority for maintenance and treatment.&quot; Further, they said, &quot; The functions of granting relief, and of the recovery of the cost either from the recipients or those legally liable for them, should be in the hands of one body and not divided between two or more organisations with separate staffs and methods of investigation. Such a separation must result in a multiplication of inquiries and visitations, causing annoyance and waste of time and money. The same tcriticism applies to domiciliary and institutional relief.&quot; (Majority Report, Part IX, pages 196-197, Octavo Edition.)14. The&apos; path towards a reconciliation of the divergent views of the Majority and Minority Commissioners was opened by the concession of the principle upon which the Majority had insisted so emphatically, namely, that the family rather than the individual should be regarded as the unit of assistance. The next step was taken when the special Sub-Committee, appointed by the Local Government Committee, reported to the main Committee that &quot;We have found a basis of agreement on the lines of a fundamental distinction between the dispensing of relief in money or kind in the homes of the recipients, and the administration of institutions and specialised services.&quot; The Sub-Committee accordingly accepted the principle laid down by the Majority Report that there should be &quot; one authority and one authority only &quot; in each area charged with the dispensation of money &quot;or food in the home of the recipients, and for this purpose proposed the setting up of a. Home Assistance Committee. On the other hand, with regard to the adminis-tration of institutions and specialised services, they expressed agreement with the Minority Report that &quot; this must be governed by the nature of the specialisation. It is undesirable that there should be, in a single town, two or more local authorities adminis-tering or subsidising either hospitals or dispensaries, schools or institutions for the. mentally defective, or the specialised services connected with them.&quot;15, The main Committee provisionally adopted the conclusions of the Sub-Committee and proceeded on the lines suggested in their Report. But the battle was not yet over. It broke out again when the Committee came to consider the precise functions to be assigned to the Home Assistance Committee. The result is. seen in the published report, paragraphs 13, 14 and 15. While the Committee recommend that &quot; medical assistance in the, home should be given by the staff of the medical officer of health under Public Health Acts suitably extended,&quot; they assign to the Home Assistance Committee :-&quot; (a) The duty of making the necessary inquiries into the economic circumstances of applicants for or recipients of any form of assistance in money, kind or service, wholly or partly provided out of rates or taxes, eligibility for which is dependent on the pecuniary need of the person or family concerned, and for which payment is legally recoverable ;&quot; (6) The general supervision of all recipients of such assistance and their dependants ; and&quot; (c) The administration of all assistance (as above defined) in money or kind given in the home of the recipient.&quot;16. There can be no doubt whatever that any departure from the principle of one authority and one authority only in each area for investigation, supervision and administration of assistance in the home, would be stoutly opposed by all who hold the same views as Lord George Hamilton and the signatories of the Majority Report.   It is
needless to say that it is perfectly open to the Government to disregard the compromise effected among the members of the Maclean Committee, but it is submitted that any scheme based on the assumption that it is possible to hand over medical assistance in the home to the Public Health Authority, while leaving other forms of home assistance to the Poor Law Authority, is essentially unsound. Men, women and children in necessitous circum-stances are at one time in good health, at another they are ill. A person on Monday may require relief which is not medical; on Tuesday the same person may require relief which is medical. It is therefore not only difficult but almost impossible to divide the medical from the other forms of relief; both are provided for one and the same person. And from a purely practical point of view such a plan would have no compensating advan-tages. So far from simplifying the process of transference, it would aggravate and intensify the difficulties, and on every ground, either of expediency or principle, it appears to be open to the gravest objections.ABOLITION OF THE POOR LAW.17. As mentioned above, Poor Law Reform as contemplated by the Maclean Committee and as generally understood at the present time, implies not only an alteration of the administrative machinery but also the absorption of the existing services of the Boards of Guardians in the several specialised services of the Local Authorities to whom the functions of the Guardians are to be transferred.18. The Maclean Committee recommended that&apos;: (a) The provision at the expense of the rates, with &quot;or without Exchequer grants,, for the sick and infirm (including maternity and infancy and the aged requiring institutional care, and all institutions appropriated to any of these), should be made by the Council under Public Health Acts suitably extended. The Council should organise such preventive and curative treatment as the cases individually require by means of their specialised institutions and medical staff.(6) The provision for all children able to attend school (including residential and special schools of all kinds) should be regarded as predominantly a matter of educational training, and should be made by the Local Education Authority under the Education Acts suitably extended.(c) The provision for the mentally deficient, and for persons of unsound mind, whether certified or not, including all institutions appropriated to these classes, should be made by the Council under the Lunacy and Mental Deficiency Acts, suitably extended, and through the Committee or Committees adminis-tering their powers under these Acts.19. Hence the announcement proposed to be made by the Government in connection with the Ministry of Health and Local Government Bill contains the statement that &quot; the Government accept the recommendations of the Committee that services relating to the care and treatment of the sick and infirm should not be administered as a part of the Poor Law, but should be made a part of the general health services of the community.&quot;20. It will, however, be agreed that neither the translation of this doctrine into the form of a statutory enactment, nor the solution of the complicated problems to which its practical application must inevitably give rise, can be accomplished without con-siderable difficulty.21. What is implied in the phrase &quot; should not be administered as a part of the Poor Law &quot; ? As is stated above, and as indeed is proved by the context, the intention is not only that the health services should be transferred from the Boards of Guardians to the County and Municipal Authorities, but also that these services should cease to be administered under the Poor Law Statutes and Orders. From this it would seem to follow that the Poor Law Statutes should be repealed, and the Orders rescinded. But this is not a task to be lightly undertaken, and before embarking upon it we shall be bound to forecast the consequences and endeavour to appraise their gravity. If we abolish the Poor Law we must be reasonably sure what it is that we are destroying.22. In the first place shall we be destroying the right to relief ? Is the right to relief a statutory right or a common law principle ? And what will be the effect of repealing, the Statutes upon which such a large and important body of case law has been based ?
23. It is evident that these questions would require the most careful and critical examination before any attempt could be made to draw the heads of a Bill. For the present purpose it will perhaps be sufficient to draw attention to the evidence given by the Legal Adviser of the Local Government Board before the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws (Questions 74 to 79), in which he gave a description of the early Poor Law legislation, of. the true place and value of the Poor Relief Act, 1601, and of the common, law origin of the characteristic features of the existing Poor Law system.24. Without attempting to prejudge the outcome of this examination, it may be useful to indicate some of the possible courses which might be taken : (1) All the Acts relating to the relief of the poor might be repealed in their entirety. If this were done it would probably be necessary to reaffirm explicitly the statutory right to relief, as well as to lay down the powers and duties of the authorities entrusted with the administration of the health and other trans-ferred services, and the conditions under which those services should be rendered.(2) All the Acts relating to the relief of the poor might be repealed with the exception of the Act of Elizabeth. This was the suggestion made by the authors of the Minority Report, who thought that thereby they would preserve the statutory right to relief.(3) The repeal might be limited to those particular provisions of the Acts relating to the relief of the poor which appeared to be inconsistent with the new doctrine. This course seems to be open to objection on the ground that, while it would require a meticulous examination of every provision of every Poor Law statute, it would still not obviate the necessity for constructing a fresh code designed to give effect to the accepted principles of reform. To this it may be added that the intention of some of the existing and particularly the older statutory provisions is obscure, that many of these provisions are obsolete and unsuitable to modern requirements, and that the essential provisions contained in over 300 Acts of Parliament relating directly or in-directly to the relief of the poor could be very well compressed into a much smaller and more convenient compass. Incidentally, it may be pointed out that all these objections would apply with even greater force if an attempt were made to deal with the health services apart from the other transferred services.25. On the whole, it would seem that the balance of advantage will be found to lie on the side of the first of the courses indicated above.26. There remains to be considered what is perhaps the most difficult and trouble-some question of all. What is the exact intention and precise effect of the Maclean Committee&apos;s recommendations that provision for the sick and infirm should in the future be made &quot; under Public Health Acts suitably extended &quot; ; that provision for all children able to attend school should be made &quot; under the Education Acts suitably extended &quot; ; and that provision for the mentally deficient and for persons of unsound mind should be made &quot; under the Lunacy and Mental Deficiency Acts suitably extended &quot; ? Under what conditions is the Home Assistance Committee to give assistance in the home of the recipient, or the Unemployment Committee to make provision for the able-bodied unemployed or vagrants ? And what meaning is to be attached to the proposed Govern-ment announcement that services relating to the care and treatment of the sick and infirm &quot; should be made a part of the general health services of the community &quot; 127. Some reasons have been suggested in other parts of these notes for transferring all the functions of the Poor Law Authorities simultaneously, but in any event the merging of the medical services of the Boards of Guardians in the general health services of the community will present special difficulties, and in view of the importance of this question in relation to the question of the Ministry of Health, it will be convenient to devote par-ticular attention to this subject.
MEDICAL. SERVICES.28. In order to appreciate the magnitude of the issues involved, it will be necessary not only to review the present conditions of medical assistance but also to recall at any rate the more recent stages in the growth of the existing system.29. Outside private practice and the Army and &quot;Navy Medical Departments there are three great medical services in this country the Public Health Service, the Poor Law Medical Service, and the Insurance Service. It is proposed that in the future these three services should be all under the control of the Ministry of Health and Local Government, and that the Poor Law Medical Service should be merged in the Public Health Service. We have, therefore, to consider not only what is involved in the fusion of the Public Health and Poor Law Medical Services, but also what effect this fusion would have upon the Insurance Service, and to what extent it may become necessary that it also should be merged in a complete Public Medical Service.30. It is too often forgotten what a large part the Poor Law Medical Service plays in providing medical assistance for the poorer classes in this country. There are approxi-mately 4,500 doctors in the Poor Law Service, of whom about 3,500 are employed on Out-door Medical Relief, and ab6ut 1,000 on Indoor or Institutional Medical Relief. The total number of institutions included in the Hospital Return issued by tjie Local Govern-ment Board in 1915, was 2,664, with 178,525 beds of these 700 were Poor Law Institutions with no less than 94,001 beds definitely allocated to sick persons as against 594 General Hospitals with 31,329 beds, and 222 Special Hospitals with 13,654 beds. On the 1st January, 1915, the number of persons in receipt of relief who were definitely ascertained to be suffering from sickness, accident or bodily infirmity, was 270,665, of whom 117,037 were relieved in institutions, and 153,628 were given outdoor relief. Owing to the sus-pension of the usual returns, similar figures cannot be given for later years, but it may be mentioned that on the 1st January, 1916, there were 71,704 persons in sick wards of workhouses and separate Poor-Law institutions for the sick, as compared with 78,083 on the 1st January, 1915.31. The Royal Commission on the Poor Laws devoted much time and labour to the question of Poor Law medical relief, and inasmuch as sickness is one of the principal causes of pauperism, they very properly considered it not merely as an independent subject, but also in relation to the larger question of the provision of medical assistance to the industrial population generally.The Majority Report pointed out that &quot; indoor medical relief, administered under the purely deterrent principle of the workhouse system, ended in failure, and was abandoned in 1867 in favour of a system in which &apos; curative treatment&apos; became the dominant principle. That principle . . . has gradually revolutionised the treatment of the indoor sick poor in those Unions which have established infirmaries under separate management. These separate infirmaries are now fulfilling functions far beyond those for which they were originally intended ; they constitute a useful adjunct to the voluntary hospitals ; and in some cases they even supply the want of a voluntary hospital. The anomalous situation that has arisen may be said to represent the effect of the unsatisfied demand on the part of the community for hospital treatment. In short, the separate infirmaries are practically &apos; State &apos; or rate-aided hospitals.&quot; That there still exists in the minds of certain of the respectable poor a prejudice against entering the Poor Law infirmary, is undeniable, but it is equally true that the prejudice is fast disappearing. On the other hand, in spite of great improvements, medical relief, when administered in a workhouse, is still repellant to large numbers of the sick poor.&quot;32, With regard to outdoor medical relief, they said that the chief improvement had been the establishment of dispensaries in the Metropolis and in a few urban centres. They continued,: &quot;It has been the aim of the Central Authority in their administration of outdoor medical relief to leave the independence of the labouring; classes unimpaired, and, in this respect, the administration has had a. fair measure of success, for, as we have shown, large numbers do now make provision for medical: aid in sickness by some form of insurance.&quot;&quot; As regards those who have not made such provision, outdoor medical relief is am attraction to many who are quite able to join a medical club or provident dispensary. On the other hand, the stigma which still accompanies the receipt of that relief deters many poor persons probably the most respectable of the poor from seeking, medical aid at times when they are sorely in need of it.&quot;
&apos; 33. The Majority, holding strongly that medical assistance, while not being deterrent, should at the same time be such as will encourage rather than discourage independent provision by every class that is able to afford it, recommended the re-organisation of medical assistance on a provident basis.34. The Minority were of opinion that &quot; the very principle of the Poor Law medical service its restriction to persons who prove themselves to be destitute involves delay and reluctance in the application of the sick person for treatment; hesitation and delay in beginning the treatment; and, in strictly administered districts, actual refusal of all treatment to persons who are in need of it, but who can manage to pay for some cheap substitute. These defects, which we regard as inherent in any medical service adminis-tered by a destitution authority, stand in the way of the discovery and early treatment of.an incipient disease, and accordingly deprive the medical treatment of most of its value.&quot;As a remedy, the Minority, in consonance with their genera] scheme of reform, recom-mended the establishment of one united public medical service, in which the medical services of the Poor Law and the Public Health Authorities would be merged.35. Apart from the Poor Law, the Public Health, and the Education Authorities, the principal agencies for supplying medical assistance to the working-classes at the date of the Royal Commissions Report, were (1) voluntary hospitals, (2) free dispensaries, and (3) Friendly Societies, provident dispensaries and medical clubs.36. The Report of the Poor Law Commission was issued in 1909. The National Insurance Act was passed in 1911. In the Cabinet Memorandum of 3rd April, 1911, Mr. Lloyd George described the objects of the Bill as follows : -&quot; The Bill is intended to effect as wide an insurance as possible of the working-class population against sickness and breakdown. At the present moment barely 50 per cent, of our industrial population are able to make . effective provision against these contingencies. The premiums are too high for men with, low wages and large families to keep up through life. Hence, when sickness comes, poverty and distress ensue. ... It is also intended to make the Bill as far as possible a preventive measure operating to reduce the amount of sickness, with its resulting pauperism and misery in the country. Both the Majority and Minority Reports of the Poor Law Commission call special attention to the utter inadequacy of our methods for preventing and curing sickness among the industrial classes. -This Bill contains several provisions designed to amend this unsatisfactory state of things.&quot;37. In dealing with the question of medical attendance, Mr. Lloyd George said : &quot; I have interviewed a- large number of doctors on the medical side of this scheme. They all agree in denouncing the present system of medical relief as organised by the Friendly Societies. ... I should like to see the whole of the medical work under the scheme undertaken by the Health Committee, and I have no doubt that is what will ultimately ensue. But compulsorily to transfer the medical work now undertaken by Friendly Societies, Medical Clubs and Works Clubs to the Health Committee would at this stage provoke formidable opposition. I propose, however, to give these societies the option of handing over this part of their duties to the Health Committee, the latter charging them 5s. per member. Even then there would be a deficit. I propose that this should be shared between the State and the Local Authorities ; the latter can well afford it, for the scheme must effect a considerable saving in the medical charges now falling on the rates. The compulsory character of the scheme secures a contribution of 5s. a head from that class of the population who now, having the society to fall back upon in case of sickness, resort to the Poor Law both for medicine and maintenance.&quot;38. It may be mentioned here that a proposal was made during the preparation and passage of the Bill that the Health Committees (subsequently termed Insurance &apos; Committees), should be made Statutory Committees of the County and County Borough Councils. Mr. Lloyd George, however, could not see his way to accept this suggestion. The principal difficulty was no doubt that the Health Committee would be administering money which came to it through the Insurance Funds, whereas, if it became a Committee of the Council, its finance would become the finances of the Council.
39. The Bill underwent many changes during its passage through Parliament. For the present purpose the most important of these changes was the transference of the administration of medical benefit from the Friendly Societies to. the Insurance Committees accompanied by the provision for the institution of the &quot; panel &quot; system.40. The Act received the Royal Assent on the 16th December, 1911. Medical Benefit came into operation on the 15th January, 1913. On that date panels had been formed for every County and County Borough of Great Britain and comprised the names of more than 15,000 doctors. There were only three such areas in England in which it was found necessary to suspend the panel system.41. But the issue had been long in doubt, and it was not until a few days before the date on which Medical Benefit came into operation that the successful initiation of the panel system was assured. The history of the protracted negotiations between the Government and the medical profession is related at some length in the First Annual Report of the Insurance Commissioners, and it is unnecessary to repeat it here. But two points should be mentioned as they may have an important bearing upon the future of Medical Service in this country : (1) The doctors or perhaps it would be more correct to say the British Medical Association objected both to the conditions of service as embodied in the Commissioners&apos; Regulations and to the amount of remuneration assigned to them. The terms and conditions of service were fixed for a period of three years only. This period has been extended in consequence of the War, but after the War they will have to be reviewed, and this may prove the occasion for another fight between the doctors and the Government.(2) If the doctors in 1913 had persisted in their opposition and panels had not been formed, the Government would have set up a salaried service of doctors, with consultants, specialists, and nurses, to attend not only insured persons, but also the dependants of insured persons and uninsured members of Friendly Societies. This scheme was worked out in considerable detail -the principle was fully endorsed by the Advisory Committee, representing the interests of the insured persons; and the Government would undoubtedly have put it into force had the doctors not yielded.42. The panel system in operation has not escaped criticism. Much of this is probably unfair and may be discounted. When it is borne in mind that there are on the one side some fourteen million insured, persons and on the other some 18,000 doctors, it is not surprising that there are complaints by insured persons of the conduct of the doctors, and by doctors of the conduct of the insured.43. The real defects of the present system lie much deeper. &quot; Medical Benefit&quot; is defined by s. 8 of the Act as &quot; medical treatment and attendance, including the pro-vision of proper and sufficient medicines and such medical and surgical appliances as may be prescribed by regulations to be made by the Insurance Commissioners.&quot; Section 15 enacts that &quot; (1) Every Insurance Committee shall, for the purpose of administering medical benefit make arrangements with duly qualified medical practitioners in accordance with regulations made by the Insurance Commissioners. (2) The regulations made by the Insurance Commissioners shall provide for the arrangements made being . . ., such as to secure that insured persons shall , . . receive adequate medical attendance and treatment from the medical practitioners with whom arrangements are so made.&quot; The regulations made by the Commissioners, however, provide that the panel doctors shall contract to give treatment of a kind which can &quot; consistently with the best interests of the patient be properly undertaken by a practitioner of ordinary professional com-petence and skill.&quot;1 44. It has been alleged that these regulations constitute a violation of the provisions of the Statute inasmuch as, instead of providing fdr adequate medical treatment, they exclude the treatment, of serious illness requiring specialist, operative, or institutional treatment. The regulations could probably be defended as intra vires for reasons which it is unnecessary to enter upon here, but the fact remains that the panel system does not provide complete medical treatment even for insured persons. This defect would have been partially remedied by a scheme for the organisation of a system of medical referees and consultants and of clinics, which was in contemplation when the War broke out; but even so, the demand for institutional treatment would have been left unsatisfied.
45. The experience of the last few years has revealed some other defects in the Medical Service of this country to which attention will have to be given in considering any large scheme of reform : (1) There is a shortage and a most uneven distribution of doctors.(2) There is a shortage and a most uneven distribution of hospital accommodation.(3) The standard of medical treatment in industrial class practice is not satisfactory.46. A complete Public Medical Service would provide a remedy for the first two of these defects. Whether the standard of medical treatment would be raised or lowered under a whole-time salaried system is a debatable question, as is also the question whether doctors generally would be willing or reluctant to work under such a system. Without attempting to answer either of these questions here it may be suggested that the recent experience of so many doctors in the whole-time salaried service of the Army will probably lead many of them to change their previous opinions on the subject.47. Not the least important side of the question of medical service is the financial one. Already, owing to the concessions made during the passage of the Insurance Bill and the subsequent claims of the doctors, it has been necessary to supplement the financial provision made by the Insurance Act itself by Exchequer grants in aid of medical benefit alone amounting to some two millions a year. The additional grants for the provision of a system of medical referees, etc., alluded to above, would have amounted to  275,000 a year. When the time comes for revising the present agreements with the doctors an increase in their remuneration will probably be expected. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the question should be asked whether a better medical service could not be provided at less or no greater cost.48. As will be seen in the quotations from Mr. Lloyd G-eorge&apos;s Memoranda given above it was anticipated that the operation of the Insurance Act would bring about a decrease of pauperism due to sickness and a diminution in Poor Law expenditure. These hopes have scarcely been realised. On the 1st January, 1913, the total number of paupers of all classes was 794,227 ; on the 1st January, 1914, it was 761,578 ; and on the 1st January, 1915, it was 762,196. The decrease of 30,000 between 1st January, 1913, and 1st January 1914, may have been partially due to the operation of the Insurance Act. The slight increase on the 1st January, 1915, may have been due to the War. The greater part of the subsequent decrease in pauperism since that date is almost entirely attributable to the War. The total expenditure on the relief of the poor (other than expenditure defrayed out of loans) during the year ended 31st March, 1912, amounted to  14,463,902, and during the year ended 31st March, 1915, amounted to  15,807,449. The intervention of the war period has, of course, rendered all statistics unreliable for purposes of com-parison, and it may be that it is too early to assess the full effect of the Insurance Act on pauperism. It is clear, however, that so far the operation of the Act has not resulted in any substantial relief to the rates.49. While Poor Law expenditure has increased at a rapid rate during the past 20 or 30 years, it is notorious that there has also been a steady growth of expenditure on other forms of public assistance, and it is hardly possible to consider the financial position without raising the question whether the country is getting, full value for its money and whether better results at less cost might not be achieved by a unification of services and by a simplification of areas and of administration.50. As the Committee on Public Retrenchment pointed out: &quot; the condition of the public finances and the burdens which must fall upon the nation for a generation to come may render it necessary for Parliament to effect a more drastic curtailment of expenditure &quot; than could be effected by the adoption of the temporary economies which were all that they were authorised to suggest. On the other hand there is a general expectation that the scheme of &quot; Reconstruction &quot; will embrace reforms designed to ameliorate the con-ditions of the working classes, and in particular an improvement in the health services of the country.51. Is it possible to satisfy these divergent claims ? It may at least be said thct there is more to be hoped for in this direction from a unified health service than from a continuance of the three incomplete and independent services which are at present in existence.52. The question still remains, what, apart from the fusion of the Public Health, Poor Law, and Insurance Services, would be involved in a complete Public Medical Service ? It may be presumed that such a service should be (a) adequate, and therefore should
comprise domiciliary, consultant, specialist, and institutional treatment; find (b) avail-able for the whole population. But it does not necessarily follow that it should be free. It might be so, on the other hand it might be subject to restrictions, such as (1) an income limit; (2) power to recover cost of treatment; and (3) insurance or other provident contributions.53. Sooner or later the Government will have to make up their minds on these vital questions of policy, and it would seem to be well worth consideration whether the estab-lishment of a Ministry of Health and Local Government should not be either accompanied or immediately followed by the appointment of a Royal Commission, as suggested by Sir W. Collins, or of a Departmental Committee to advise the Government on this difficult subject.OTHER TRANSFERRED SERVICES.54. The transfer of the Guardians&apos; functions in regard to the care of children and lunatics and mental defectives, and the contemplated extension of the Education, Lunacy, and Mental Deficiency Acts, although requiring close consideration, will not present the same degree of difficulty as the transfer of the health functions.55. But the future treatment of the able-bodied is a problem of great complexity and one which it is very desirahle to settle before the Boards of Guardians are abolished. Indeed, there is much to be said in favour of dealing with this problem, if practicable, in advance of the demobilisation of the Forces and of the Civil War Workers, and before the inevitable dislocation of industry consequent upon the termination of hostilities produces an increase in unemployment and vagrancy. This question is dealt with more fully in Appendix B.CONCLUSION.56. In the above memorandum an attempt has been made to indicate some of the most important consequences which would appear to follow upon the establishment of a Ministry of Health and Local Government and the announcement on the subject of Poor Law Reform, which it is proposed should be made by the Government at the appropriate stage of the Bill to be introduced for this purpose. It will hardly be denied that the problems which will arise are of the highest importance. To deal with them adequately and to enable the Government to redeem their pledges with the promptitude which will be expected, it will probably be necessary to set up two or three expert Committees to make a detailed examination of the principal questions waiting for decision and to advise the Government in regard to the policy to be adopted and the machinery required to give effect to such policy in each case.57. It is suggested that for this purpose three committees should be appointed, the first to deal with all the questions involved in the fusion of the medical services, the second to deal with the treatment of the able-bodied and unemployment, and the third, which would have to keep in close touch with the other two, to deal with the legal, technical, financial, and administrative problems referred to in the Appendix to these notes, and to draw the heads of such Bill or Bills as may be necessary to carry out the policy finally determined upon by the Government.A. V. SYMONDS.Local Government Board, October, 1918.
APPENDIX A.ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY.Tho principal difficulties which will probably arise in connection with the question of the administrative machinery involved in the scheme of Poor Law Reform recommended by Sir D. Maclean&apos;s Committee are dealt with under the following heads, viz. :-(1) The position of the minor local authorities in the scheme; (2) The problem of London and the surrounding areas ; (3) The principle of co-option; (4) The allocation of the property and liabilities of the Guardians among the Councils concerned ; (5) The financial consequences of the transfer ; and (6) The allocation of transferred functions to specified committees.THE MINOR LOCAL AUTHORITIES.There have been few Bills in recent years conferring powers and duties on Local Government bodies in which controversy has not arisen on the question of the position of the smaller local authorities, and it would have been surprising if similar differences of opinion had not emerged during the proceedings of the Com-mittee. The question is discussed in paragraphs 21-24 of the Report, and in the separate memoranda appended to the Report by Mr. Curtis, Mr. Montagu Harris, and Mr. Pritchard, respectively.The way in which this question is dealt with in any legislation transferring the functions of Boards of Guardians to other Local Authorities must largely depend upon the position which these authorities occupy at the time when legislation takes place, and what might be considered an ideal scheme will probably have to give place to an arrangement, though possibly of only a temporary character, which will take account of the powers and duties for the time being possessed by the existing Local Authorities. If, for instance, it be assumed that Poor Law Reform would precede any disturbance of the present functions of the minor urban and of the rural district councils, the medical services of those authorities cannot be left out of consideration in any scheme dealing with the transference of the Poor Law medical services. On the whole it would seem that so long as the urban and rural district councils retain their present powers under the Public Health Acts, the precise arrangement to be made in each county area should be determined by a scheme prepared locally and confirmed by the Ministry of Health and Local Government, subject, however, to the proviso that so far as practicable institutional services should be concentrated in the hands of the county authority.It would also be advisable that all such schemes should be of a temporary and provisional nature, and subject to reconsideration and modification in the light of experience of their actual working or in consequence of subsequent legislation.LONDON.In the case of London, the outstanding questions may be grouped under two main heads, viz. : (1) the administrative area, and (2) the division of functions between the County Council and the minor authorities.As regards the first of these two main questions, there is much to be said in favour of an area comprising not only the County of London but in addition the large urban areas situate in what is commonly known as Greater London. But for the purpose of facilitating and expediting legislation the balance of advantage appears to lie on the side of dealing in the first instance with the area of the administrative county alone and of remitting for further and subsequent consideration the question of extending that area so as to embrace the dormitories of London.As to the division of functions between the County Council and the Metropolitan Borough Councils, the Committee were largely guided by the advice of Mr. Norman, whose knowledge and experience of London Local Government is admittedly very great. For the moment it is probably unnecessary to suggest any alterna-tives to his scheme, but attention may be called to paragraphs 5 and 7 of Mr. Pritchard&apos;s Memorandum in which he says: &quot; 5. As regards London, it will in my opinion be necessary for the scheme to indicate with a considerable degree of precision the division of functions between the County Council and the Borough Councils, and to some extent also the policy and rules of local administration, so as to minimise the prospect of differences between the two classes of local authorities. In this connection I shouldrnot regard the original scheme as a final document; it would be capable of such modification as experience may from time to time suggest and as may be approved by the Local Government Board.&quot;&quot; 7. I also think that provision should be made for the settlement by the Local Government Board of any difference that may arise between the County Council and any Borough Council, particularly in regard to the payments to be made to the latter, and other financial matters ; I anticipate that the right of appeal would be rarely exercised, but that if the right exists the parties are more likely to come to an agreement.&quot;1CO-OPTION.&apos; The Local Government Committee proposed that any committee through whom any functions transferred to the Town or County Council from the Poor Law Authorities are to be administered should include men and women and representatives of bodies (not being members of the Town or County Council) possessing experience of various kinds in the work to be done, and in the first instance persons who have been members of a Poor Law Authority. They further proposed that the Prevention of Unemployment Committee should include representatives of Employers&apos; Associations and of Organised Labour.There is very much to be said in favour of these proposals which were strongly supported by&apos;the majority of the members of Sir D. Maclean&apos;s Committee. The County and Municipal Councils would find it extremely difficult adequately to discharge the additional functions&apos; proposed to be transferred to them without an enlargement of their committees ; and it would be a real advantage to them to have the assistance of hum
and women who, though keenly interested in particular sides of the Councils new activities, do not possess the time or the inclination to devote themselves to the general work of the Council and to face the ordeal of a County or Municipal election. On the other hand, provided that the power of the Council to reserve the right of giving a final decision on a subject of general policy, and of the Finance Committee to control the expenditure, is duly safeguarded, it is difficult to see why these proposals should carry with them any diminution of popular control. Since the establishment of the Local Education Committees in 1902 the principle of co-option has gained ground, and the further extension proposed by Sir D. Maclean&apos;s Committee will probably find considerable support. It may be anticipated that the County Councils Association will declare in favour of it. The Association of Municipal Corporations on the other hand will probably contest it.   (Vide paragraph 12 of Mr. Pritchard&apos;s Memorandum.)ALLOCATION OF PROPERTY AND LIABILITIES OF POOR LAW AUTHORITIES AMONG THECOUNCILS CONCERNED.This will be a matter of considerable difficulty, and it will probably be necessary to appoint Commissioners for the purpose.In a large number of cases the present Union area docs not coincide with or lie wholly within the area of any administrative county or borough ; institutions are frequently situated outside the area of the Union to which they belong ; in some instances institutions are the joint property of a combination of Unions ; certain Unions are well equipped with modern institutions, while others possess only an old-fashioned work-house ; in some cases the Councils concerned will be in great need of additional institutions, in others they will already be in possession of as many institutions as they can economically administer. Similar questions will arise in regard to the allocation of the existing staffs of the Poor Law Authorities. And the whole problem will be further complicated if the transference should take place either (a) while so many Poor Law Institutions are still in military occupation, or (b) while the future policy of the country in regard to local government generally and health services in particular is still unsettled.FINANCE.The financial consequences of their proposals were so lightly touched upon by the Maclean Committee that it may be said that this vital part of the problem still remains to be explored. The financial adjust-ments between local authorities to whom property and liabilities of the Guardians are to be transferred, the financial relations in County areas between the County Council and the minor local authorities, the rates or funds out of which expenditure of various kinds under the new scheme is to be defrayed and consequential alterations in local taxation if the Poor Rate is abolished, the Exchequer Grants new and old, all these are questions of great complexity requiring the most careful examination by a small committee of experts.ALLOCATION OF FUNCTIONS TO SPECIFIED COMMITTEES.Mr. Curtis in his separate Memorandum says : &quot; If County, Borough and other Councils are to be entrusted with further important functions, I consider these bodies should be allowed greater freedom than the recommendations permit of in allocating the new duties to committees. A scheme appropriate to Manchester or Birmingham might be found cumbersome and costly for Eastbourne. Similarly a scheme suitable for a county mainly industrial, such as Stafford, might be found unworkable in a Rural County such as Hereford.&quot;Mr. Pritchard deals with the same point in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of his Memorandum.   He writes : &quot; The scheme relating to County Boroughs is in my opinion open to the objection that it involves unnecessary interference with the councils in regard to the manner in which, and particularly the committees through whom, the transferred functions are to be performed. In the past it was the practice of Parliament to confer and impose definite powers and duties upon Town Councils, and not to tell them how their functions were to be performed or what committees they must appoint; the powers and duties being prescribed by Parliament, the responsibility for finding the best and most suitable method of carrying them out according to the local circumstances was left with the council in each case. A notable example of this policy is the Public Health Act, 1875, whereby most extensive powers are given to Urban and Rural Sanitary Authorities, but where Parliament, wisely, in my judgment, refrained from indicating what committee should be appointed to assist in their performance.&quot; I am aware that more recently Parliament has in some cases interfered with the discretion of local authorities in the appointment of Committees, either by direct enactment or by requiring the approval of schemes by a central department. Personally, I think that this is a mistake, and 1 trust that the practice will not be extended.&quot; In the present case it is, in my opinion, sufficient to transfer the functions of the Poor Law Authorities to the councils of County Boroughs, with such modifications and extensions as are desirable (the modifications consisting largely, I trust, of the removal of unnecessary central control) and to empower the councils in performing these functions to make use of their existing statutory committees (for example, the asylums and education committees), and to appoint such other com-mittees as they may think necessary. If this course is not adopted, not only will unnecessary difficulties be placed in the way of councils in the performance of onerous duties, but there is the real fear that the new statutory committees, and particularly the home assistance committees, will he regarded as the old Poor Law Authority under a new name.&quot;Considerable weight must be attached to these reservations, and it would be imprudent to provoke the opposition of the Local Authorities by insisting that the schemes outlined in the Report should be translated into legislation and imposed by statute upon the County and Borough Councils.
It might bo desirable for the Central Department to frame model schemes and to require the Local Bodies to submit their schemes to the Central Department for confirmation, but even this limited amount of inter-fcrence is open to some objection and it is doubtful whether in the last resort the Central Department could legitimately refuse to confirm any scheme which purported to give effect to the general principles laid down by Parliament and did not merely perpetuate the old poor law authority under a new name.In any case it may be assumed that a question of this kind could be better left to be dealt with by regulations than settled by an Act of Parliament, and that if schemes are required to be framed and approved they should be subject to revision after a short experience of their working.A.V.S.APPENDIX B.UNEMPLOYMENT.Quite apart from any question of Poor Law Reform, the need will arise in the near future, if indeed it has not already arisen, for a reconsideration of the whole problem of assistance for men and women affected by unemployment. The general level of employment is at present almost unprecedently high, but even now certain localities and certain industries are suffering from shortage of work owing to the restriction of theimports of raw materials and other causes, and the Government have found it necessary to devise or acquiesce in temporary expedients for the assistance of the workers so affected. On the cessation of hostilities it may be hoped that, provided the raw materials and the capital are forthcoming, there will be no unemployment such as that with which the country was threatened at the outbreak of war. But it would be rash to assume that the inevitable dislocation of industry will not result in numbers of men and women being thrown out of work for periods of longer or shorter duration according to the success or failure of the measures taken by the Government to deal with the situation.Schemes have already been prepared for the demobilisation of the Forces, including the assistance of those men who may find themselves unemployed. Schemes are under consideration for the demobilisation of the Civil War Workers. And the Ministry of Labour have in preparation a comprehensive scheme of unemploy-ment insurance.What appears to be needed however is a careful examination of these various schemes and their co-ordination, one with another, and with the other measures which already exist or may be proposed for the relief of distress due to unemployment.Previous attempts to deal with the problem of the unemployed able-bodied have not been attended with conspicuous success and on the outbreak of hostilities it was found necessary to set up a special organisation for the relief of distress due to the war. While it may perhaps be claimed that the measures then taken marked an advance upon anything that had been attempted hitherto, it is beyond all question that such measures would in future fail to satisfy the demands and expectations of the unemployed soldier or sailor or of the representatives of organised labour. *The following are some of the questions which seem to require an answeT if the Government desire to have a consistent and comprehensive policy, in regard to unemployment: (1) Are temporary measures to be devised for the period of demobilisation and resettlement, or is an attempt to be made to lay the foundations of a permanent scheme at once ?(2) If a universal scheme of unemployment insurance is adopted, to what extent will it cover the ground ? If either the amount or the duration of benefit is insufficient to tide over the period of unemployment, is the deficiency to be supplemented by a relief organisation, and, if so, by what organisation and under what conditions ?(3) If the scheme of unemployment insurance is not universal, which trades and which classes of work-people are to be included and which excluded ?(4) Is the same scheme to be applicable to the demobilised sailors and soldiers and to the civil war . workers ?(5) At what stage is the demobilised sailor or soldier who is given a free policy to begin contributing to a &quot; civil &quot; insurance scheme ?(6) What functions are to be assigned respectively to the Ministry of Labour, to the Ministry of Health and Local Government, and to the Government Committee on the Prevention of Relief and Distress, in regard to the assistance of persons affected by unemployment ?(7) To what uses is the National Relief Fund to be put after the war ?(8) What are to be the relations between (a) the Local Advisory Committees and Employment Exchanges under the Ministry of Labour ; (b) the Local Representative Committees established by the Local Government Board at the beginning of the war ; (c) the Distress Committees under the Unemployed Workmen Act; and (d) the Poor Law Authorities ?(9) If the recommendations of the Local Government Reconstruction Committee are adopted and the Poor Law is abolished, what will be the functions of the new Public Assistance Authorities in regard to the able-bodied unemployed ?Until these questions have been thoroughly examined it would be premature to pronounce any final judgment upon the universal scheme of unemployment insurance proposed by the Ministry of Labour or to put forward any specific alternative in the form of either insurance or relief measures.It is submitted therefore that the whole subject in all its bearings should be closely examined by a com-mittee of experts qualified to express an opinion on the various aspects of the question and to view the parts in relation to the whole. Such a committee might be instructed &quot;to inquire into the various proposals which have been submitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government for assisting persons suffering from want of employment, whether by schemes of insurance or by measures for the relief of distress, or otherwise, and the various schemes which are in operation for assisting persons suffering from want of employment, and to consider and report what modified or additional means should be adopted for dealing with unemployment arising (a) during the war, (6) during the period of demobilisation and resettlement, and (c) subsequently.&quot;AYS.

PREFATORY NOTE BY THE MINISTER OF RECONSTRUCTION.I have thought it desirable to issue this lleport in order to enable the public to form a considered judgment upon the general problem of the co-ordination of Public Assistance in England and Wales which is covered by the Committee&apos;s present recommendations.It will be seen that the Report deals with the future administration of the services at. present entrusted to Poor Law Authorities, and represents a reasoned attempt to secure reforms in harmony with those indicated by the Royal Commission which reported on the subject in 1909 without reviving the controversies which then centred round the Majority and Minority Reports of that body.It seems to me accordingly to be advisable, if for this reason alone, to secure the widest publicity and the fullest discussion of these proposals, which at many points intimately affect the administrative system of England and Wales. But I anticipate, also, that many of those who read the Report will be interested in the Committee&apos;s recommendations in their bearing upon the various proposals for the further development of the national provision for social services which are engaging an increased share of personal effort and public attention.CHRISTOPHER ADDISON.17 th January 1918.CONTENTS.I.

MINISTRY OF RECONSTRUCTION.Local Government Committee.To the Right Honourable Christopher, Aedison, M.P., Minister of Reconstruction.Sir,1. This Committee was appointed in July last, the terms of reference being: &quot; To consider and report upon the steps to be taken to secure the better co-ordination of Public Assistance in England and Wales and upon such other matters affecting the system of Local Government as may from time to time be referred to it.&quot;2. The Committee was composed as follows: The Right Hon. Sir DONALD MACLEAN, K.B.E., M.P. (Chairman), Mr. R. J. Curtis, Mr. Robert Donald, Sir George Fordham.The Right Hon. Lord George Hamilton, G.C.S.I.,Mr. G. Montagu Harris,Mr. Spurley Hey,Sir Robert Morant, K.O.B.,Mr. R. C. Norman,Mr. H. G. Pritchard,Sir Samuel Provis, K.O.B.,John Robertson, M.D., B.ScMr. A. V. Symonds, C.B.,The Right Hon. J. H. Thomas, M.P.; andMrs. Sidney Webb.We regret that Sir George Fordham found himself unable to attend the later meetings of the Committee, and that he consequently retired from it.I. Introductory.3. The primary matter, referred to us was the consideration of the steps to be taken to secure the better co-ordination of public assistance in England and Wales. It appeared to us desirable in the first instance to deal with the functions of Boards of Guardians and other Poor Law Authorities. We now submit our Report on this subject.We did not call witnesses, as evidence upon which conclusions could be based was already in existence in the comprehensive Reports of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress, and in subsequent public documents.II. The Need for Immediate Action.4. Although in this Report we are dealing mainly with the Poor Law, we recognise that the urgent need for a better organisation of public assistance is not a matter of Poor Law only. There are, at this moment, a large number of different bodies giving various forms of public assistance out of rates and taxes, with very inexact delimitations of the persons eligible. Many of these bodies deal on different lines, and for different reasons, with members of the same family. There are, for instance, seven different public authorities giving money in the home, leaving out of account the exceptional cases of money payments by the education andu  (33)4999(4896)  Wt 17201-565   5000  2/18 A 2
health authorities. All these are found contributing towards maintenance in various forms, institutional or other. At least six are providing various forms of medical treatment. Three are giving educational training of one sort or another. The able-bodied unemployed may be subsidised by five of them:These public bodies, many of them extending over different areas, have, with a few exceptions, no common system of registration of cases ; so that even the names of persons receiving assistance from one or more of the bodies may be unknown to some other body which may he considering their case. This absence of common knowledge results in. much overlapping, and also in occasional failure to detect cases of need.5. Not only are there many public authorities dispensing assistance out of the rates and taxes, but new ones are frequently being improvised to meet emergencies. The extent, variety and overlapping oi: the activities of these various bodies cannot adequately be set out, but there may be, often with little co-ordination between them, dealing with,infants and maternity    -     -     -  the Board of Guardians,the Local Health Authority.&apos;1&quot;&apos;the Insurance Committee.the Local War Pensions Committee.the Local Education Authority.&apos;&quot;5 children of school age    -     -     -  the Board of Guardians.the Local Education Authority. . the Local War Pensions Committee, persons of unsound mind or mentally  the Board of Guardians, defective    -----  the Mental Deficiency Authority/&quot;&apos;the Asylums Authority.&apos;&quot;5the Insurance Committee.the Local War Pensions Committee.the Local Education Authority.55 sick persons.....the Board of Guardians.the Local Health Authority.the Insurance Committee.the Local War Pensions Committee, the aged       -     -     -     -     -  the Board of Guardians.the Old Age Pensions Committee.the Insurance Committee, the able-bodied      ...     -  the Board of Guardians.the Distress Committee.the Employment Exchange (including Unemployment Insurance).the Local Representative Committee.the Local War Pensions Committee.III. The Abolition of the Boards of Guardians.6. Wre have not attempted in this Report to deal with the whole problem of over-lapping local authorities in respect of public assistance. We have limited ourselves to the largest and the most intractable case of overlapping, namely, that of the Boards of Guardians, on the one hand, and the County, Municipal and other Health and Education Authorities on the other. We are here faced by overlapping func-tions and areas, and by conflicting principles of administration. The resulting confusion has been aggravated by the growing popular prejudice against the Poor Law a prejudice which does less than justice to the devoted work of the Guardians, and the continuous improvement in poor-law administration, especially in respect of the children and the sick. For the last decade Parliament has been unwilling to entrust the Boards of Guardians with new functions, and the provision for new services has had to he made by other Local Authorities in some cases new Local Authorities  often to the increase of the confusion and overlapping. Further, the classification by institutions and the specialised treatment of recipients of assistance, almost necessarily involve an enlargement of existing areas of administration. The Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress, which sat for over three* In some eases these Authorities are the same body acting through different committees.
years and. took a very large amount of evidence, attached great importance to these points; and both the Majority and Minority Reports concurred in recommending the abolition of Boards of Guardians and of the Poor Law Union.We recommend the abolition of the Boards of Guardians and of the Poor Laic Union, and the merging of all the functions of the Poor Laio Authorities in those of the County Council and the County Borough Council, subject to the necessary modifications set out in our Schemes below for London and the other administrative counties.IV. Facilities for further Unification., 7. But although the disappearance of the Boards of Guardians would remove the most important case of overlapping, others would remain. Hence, though we confine our recommendations in this Report to what is immediately required for the unification of the Poor Law and the County and Municipal services, we have throughout kept in view such an organisation of local government as Avould render unnecessary any further multiplication of separate authorities, and would facilitate the further unification of services, which is in our view essential and on which further Reports will be necessary under our Reference. We have adopted for our guidance the prin-ciple of concentrating, as far as possible, in one Local Authority for each area, the administration of all expenditure from public funds.V. The Unification of Existing Services.8. It is, however, not sufficient to aim at bringing under one Local Authority in each area all expenditure made from local rates within that area. It is plainly undesirable to perpetuate the existence, even under one Local Authority, of separate staffs, with duplicate institutions, rendering, under different Acts of Parliament, what must be to a large extent the same services whether the persons benefited the sick and infirm, the children of school age or the lunatics and the mentally deficient  be destitute or non-destitute. It is obviously more economical that the specialised provision to be made for all persons having similar needs should be carried out by a united staff, with its appropriate series of specialised institutions, in alliance with the appropriate voluntary agencies, under the supervision of tho appropriate committee of the Council. It would then cease to be necessary to have a duplicate provision for persons in each class of need, i.e., one for those who happen to be, in the technical sense, destitute, and another for those who are not. It happens that the majority of the persons for whom provision has to be made at the expense of the local rates fall into one or other of three main categories, namely, the sick, the children, and persons suffering from physical or mental infirmity, each of which classes is already being dealt with, wholly or partly, by the County and County Borough Councils. The unification of these services would involve the establishment of no new committees, no transfer of specifically poor law powers of the Boards of Guardians, but only some applications and extensions of the Public Health, Education, Lunacy and Mental Deficiency Acts. The opportunity should be taken to provide for the inclusion on the Committees concerned, on the lines of the Education Committee, of persons and representatives of bodies experienced in the various kinds of work to be done, and in the first instance of persons who have been members of a Poor Law Authority. The general mixed workhouse would every-where cease to exist as an institution, and all the Poor Law buildings of every kind would be transferred to the Councils, to be by them appropriated and adapted to their several specialised services in whatever way might be found most convenient.We recommend that (a) The provision at the expense of the rates, with or without Exchequer Grants, for the sick and infirm [including maternity and infancy and the aged requiring institutional care, and all institutions appropriated to any of these) should he made by the Council under Public Health Acts suitably extended. The Council should organise such preventive and curative treatment as the cases individually require by means of their specialised institutions and medical staff.A 3 .
(b) The provision for all children able to attend school (including residentialand special schools of all kinds) should be regarded as predominantly a mailer of educational training, and, should be made by the Local Education Authority under the Education Acts suitably extended.(c) The provision for the menially deficient, and for persons of unsound mindwhether certified or not, including all institutions appropriated to these classes, should be made by the Council under the Lunacy and Mental Deficiency Acts, suitably extended, and through the Committee or Committees administering their powers under these Acts.There remain two other classes, for each of which a new Committee would be required.VI. The Unemployed Abie-Bodied.9. At the present time the number of able-bodied persons in need of assistance stands at a minimum, owing to the unprecedented demand for men, both for service with the colours and in industry. But however optimistic may be our estimate of trade after the war, and however general may become unemployment insurance and the use of the Employment Exchange, it is unsafe to assume that immediately peace is declared, and at intervals throughout the ensuing decades, a considerable amount of unemployment and consequent destitution or distress requiring public assistance will not arise. It is worth noting that among the unemployed men there will be a number of discharged soldiers. It may be confidently predicted that Parliament and public opinion will not allow the discharged soldiers to be dealt with by a Poor Law Authority, or by any other authority using the Poor Law principle of deterrence. Even before the war a non-poor-law policy had been adopted for the bona fide unemployed, for whom Parliament every year from 1907 down to 1914 voted special subventions to be administered by the authorities under the Unemployed Workmen Act. Upon the outbreak of the war, it Avas decided that persons whose distress was clue to the war, should not be left to the Poor Law, and a new organisa-tion was improvised for the relief of war distress, with a new set of &quot; Local Eepre-sentative Committees &quot; administering a national fund voluntarily subscribed for the purpose, and to be supplemented in case of need out of moneys voted by Parliament.10. Apart from these new Local Representative Committees, there are, at present, two statutory Local Authorities providing, at the expense of the local rates, specialised treatment for persons who are described as &quot; Able-bodied&quot; or &quot; Un-employed&quot; that is to say, for persons, not being children of school age, who are neither sick nor infirm nor yet certifiable as of unsound mind or mentally deficient  namely, the Board of Guardians, and the Distress Committee (or Central Unemployed Body) under the Unemployed Workmen Act. The provision thus made cannot in either case be deemed satisfactory, and the overlapping and potential rivalry may easily become calamitous. There seems no reason why, in place of the Board of Guardians and of the Distress Committee, there should not be a new committee of the Council to which the requisite statutory powers could be entrusted.11. We clo not suggest that the Council should be given any powers of compulsion or detention with regard to this class; but new powers, Avithout which our proposals would be incomplete, will undoubtedly be required for dealing with recalcitrant persons. We deal further Avith the subject in connection with vagrancy in the appendix to vyhich Ave draw attention (see page 26). But Ave think that the Government should institute as speedily as possible an inquiry into the nature of these poAvers of compulsion and detention, and the authority to which they should be entrusted.We recommend that the County or County Borough Council, as the case may be, should be required to appoint, in substitution for the existing authorities under the Boor Laio and under the Unemployed Wyrkmen Act, a new Committee, to be entitled &quot; The Prevention of Unemployment and Training Committee^ formed on the lines of the Education Committee, and including representatives of Employers Associations and of Organised Labour. The Committee should exercise the powers of the Council as to (i) preventing unemployment (so far as practicable, and subject to service requirements and
due economy) by procuring such a rearrangement of the CounciVs works and services as to regularise the local demand for labour; (ii) facilitating through the Employment Exchanges the finding of situations; (iii) making me of any form of educational training in co-operation as much as possible with the Education Committee; (iv) assisting migration; and (v) creating and adminis-tering, whether by themselves or in federation with other Local Authorities, any specialised provision of the kind required by the unemployed.VII. Persons receiving Home Assistance.12. finally there is the considerable class of persons for whom the appropriate form of assistance is a grant in money or kind (sometimes accompanied by specialised treatment or training), whilst they continue to live in their own homes. During the past decade there have been successively created the following additional classes of persons receiving assistance, (i) the Old Age Pensioners; (ii) the children provided with meals under the Education (Administrative Provisions) Act; (iii) the persons in distress due to the war; (iv) the soldiers&apos; dependants in receipt of supplementary allowances; and (v) the discharged soldiers and their dependants receiving allowances and special grants or pensions by reason of their pecuniary circumstances. Eligibility for most of these forms of assistance is dependent on pecuniary circumstances, and all the cases entail some sort of investigation. The public authorities concerned all draw their funds from the rates and taxes ; but each frequently acts without knowledge of what the others are doing, whilst each makes its own enquiries and comes to its own decision as to the position, claims, and needs of the same families. There is usually no common register of cases, so that it is quite possible for the same family to be simultaneously receiving public funds from several authorities, without each authority knowing that the others are also dealing with the case.13. There is thus a complex evil; involving (a) unnecessary expenditure on assistance and administration; (b) unnecessary multiplication of enquiry officers and pay-clerks; (c) annoyance to the recipients of repeated enquiries from different authorities; id) failure in many cases, oAving to lack of organisation and staff, to make the payments promptly or regularly; and (e) the temptation to fraud afforded to the applicants by the failure of tire overlapping authorities to discover what each is doing. And the evil is a growing one. It is not improbable that after the war Parliament may be importuned to extend public assistance to special classes of persons whom popular feeling will not allow to be associated with the existing poor law system ; and this may result in the addition of yet other new administrative bodies. Clearly what is needed is that, before the mischief goes any further, steps shall be taken to concentrate all work of this kind in one Committee, which will at the same time be suitable for dealing with any analogous services in the future. We may add that it seems to us desirable that to this Committee should also be assigned certain duties of general supervision for the reason that it is the only unspecialised Committee and deals with all classes of applicants for assistance in the above sense. Moreover, it alone has the opportunity, through its special knowledge of the home circumstances, of forming an opinion as to what is best for the family, as a whole, in the interests both of the family and of the community. This supervision should apply to families where any member is in receipt of any form of assistance in money, kind, or service, wholly or partly provided out of rates or taxes, eligibility for which is dependent on the pecuniary need of the person or family concerned, or for which payment is legally recoverable. In no other wray can we secure that proper regard is paid to the circumstances of the family as a unit apart from the specialised treatment&quot; of its individual members.VIII. The Home Assistance Committee.14. Eor the moment we confine our proposals to the work of the Boards of Guardians in dispensing Out-door Belief, which, we think, should be undertaken by a, new Committee of the County or County Borough Council, to be styled the Home Assistance Committee.This Committee would consider all applications for Home Assistance-that is, grants in money or kind in the home-and would have the responsibility ofA i
considering whether the condition of the applicant or that of any of his depen-dants was such as to render it desirable that he should receive specialised treatment which could be afforded to him in an institution, such as a hospital, an asylum, or a school or other training establishment. If the Home Assistance Committee thought that the case was one in which institutional treatment would be preferable to Home Assistance, the Committee would seek admission for the patient to any institution appropriate to his condition, whether under the management of the Council itself, of any other Council, or of voluntary agencies, the Committee making for this purpose any necessary payments. The general supervision we have above described should also be assigned to the Home Assistance Committee for the reasons already indicated.15. In view of the popular prejudice against tho Poor Law and of the importance of facilitating the future unification under the Home Assistance Committee of other grants in money or kind in the home, it may be preferable to confer all necessary powers on the Home Assistance Committee by new legislation.We recommend that the County or County Borough Council, as the case may be, should be required to appoint a new Committee, to be styled &quot; the Home Assistance Committee,&quot; formed on the lines of the Education Committee (including persons experienced in the work to be done, and, in the first instance, some who have been members of Boor Law Authorities), which should be charged with (i) the duty of making the necessary enquiries into the economic circumstances of applicants for or recipients of any form of assistance in money, kind, or service, loholly or partly provided out of rates or taxes, eligibility for which is dependent on the pecuniary need of the person or family concerned, or for which payment is legally recoverable; (ii) general supervision of recipients of such assistance and their dependants; (in) the administration of all such assistance in money or kind given in the home of the applicant; (iv) the exercise of the powers of the guardians of acquiring the rights and powers of parents as regards any children maintained by them who are orphans or ivhose parents are unfit to have the care of them; (v) the duty of seeking in co-operation with the appropriate committee institutional treatment for any applicant or the dependant of any applicant for lohom such treat-menl is required; (vi) the recovery from persons liable by law of expenses in respect of accommodation, maintenance, treatment, and services rendered; and (vii) the duty of keeping a register (which should not be open to public inspection) of all families within the area, any member of ivhich is in receipt of assistance as above defined, togellier with particulars of such assistance.IX. Compensation for Officers displaced or injuriously affected.16. There would be available for absorption into the staffs of the County and . County Borough Councils in the performance of their enlarged duties the extensive staffs of the Poor Law Authorities. These Poor-Law officers, who include among their number not only administrators of great experience, but also medical men, nurses and teachers, and officers trained in investigation, registration, and the distribution of relief of various kinds, are at present rendering valuable services to the community; and they are entitled to be treated with every consideration. They should all be properly provided for in schemes to be approved by the Local Government Board. &quot;We imagine that most of them would be taken over, along with the institutions or services to which they are now attached, by the authorities to which these institutions and services are transferred. But in every case there should be an option both to the new authority and to the officers concerned as to whether a transfer should in fact take place. Provision should be made for safeguarding their interests, and for their compensation whenever any of them suffer direct pecuniary loss.We recommend that the officers of the Boor Law Authorities should be transferred to the County and County Borough Councils under schemes to be approved by the Local Government Board, the Councils and the officers both having an option as to transfer; and that suitable provision should be made for the adequate compensation of all such officers as may suffer direct pecuniary loss owing either to abolition of office or to a diminution or loss of emoluments in fees, salary, or allowances. The tenure of office and all rights of superannuation of existing officers who are transferred should be fully protected.
X. Supplementary Provisions.We recommend that the property and liabilities of all Poor L%io. Aulhorl-lies should be allocated among the Councils concerned, or any combinations of them, by the Local Government Board, or by some person appointed by them, after these Councils have had an opportunity of effecting a mutual arrangement.17. Moreover, certain other duties of the Boards of Guardians, notably those relating to the appointment of the Assessment Committee. Vaccination and the llegis-tration of Births and Deaths, need to be specifically transferred to the Councils.We recommend that pending the amendment of the law relating to the valuation of properly, the power of appointing the Assessment Committees should be transferred to the County and County Borough Councils, and throughout London to the Metropolitan Borough Councils. The Councils should deter-mine tlirough which of their- committees, not being the Home Assistance Committee, they ivill administer any functions of the Boards of Guardians or combinations of Boards of Guardians (including those under the Vaccination and Births and Deaths Registration Acts) not already specified; provided that all functions relating to Health, Education, the provision for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency and the provision for Unemployment respectively should be administered exclusively under the several Acts relating thereto, suitably extended, and through the Committees dealing with such Acts.XI. Application of the Proposals to the existing Local Authorities.18. It will be seen that the fundamental principles which we have followed are  put broadly (i) the concentration, as far as practicable, in one authority in each area, of the responsibility for all administration of services from local rates; (ii) the absorption of the work of the Poor Law Authorities by existing County and Municipal Authorities, and the abolition of the general mixed workhouse; (iii) the concen-tration in one committee in each area, to be called the Home Assistance Committee, of all grants in money or kind in the home; and (iv) the concentration in the Public Health Committee of the Council of all provision for the sick and infirm, in the Education Committee of all provision for children of school age, and in the Asylums Committee of all provision for persons of unsound mind, always under the several specialised Acts.19. The manner in which it is intended that these principles should be applied to the existing local authorities will appear from the three Schemes which we have drawn up for the County Boroughs, for London, and for the other Administrative Counties respectively (see pages 11 to 19). The application of the principles in the case of County Boroughs raises no special difficulties, since the Town Council is already the one authority for the whole area; but London and other Administrative Counties need special consideration, as the existence of the several authorities within the County -somewhat complicates the problem.20. In the case of the Administrative County of London, we have set out in the Scheme what seems to us the best distribution of the functions of the Poor Law Authorities between the County Council, on the one hand, and the Metropolitan Borough Councils (including the Corporation of the City of London) on the other. We have also indicated the financial relations that we think should exist between them. We think also that the Central Unemployed Body and the Distress Com-mittees should cease to exist, and be replaced by the new Prevention of Unemploy-ment and Training Committee which we have recommended.21. In the case of the Administrative Counties other than London, we propose, in the first place, to put boroughs and urban districts having a population exceeding 50,000 in the same position of autonomy as if they were county boroughs.22. Eor the remainder of the county area we propose that the County Council should be the sole authority for the provision of specialised treatment for the uuem-ployed and for the. care of persons suffering from mental infirmity. Home Assistance should, we consider, be administered uniformly throughout each county, at the expense of the County Fund, by a Home Assistance Committee of the County Council with District Committees subject to its supervision and authority. Children will, for purposes of education, come automatically under the County Councilti  4806 IS
acting as the Local Education Authority with suitably extended powers, except in the areas of Authorities having powers under Part III. of the Education Act, 1902, who Avill in those cases be responsible for the education of the children so far as those powers extend.23. The remaining service, that of the provision to be made at the expense of the rates for the sick and infirm, presents greater difficulties owing to the fact that the County Council are only to a limited extent a Public Health Authority, and that the Borough and Urban and Rural District Councils have their own Medical Officers of Health and sanitary staff.2L We are confining our recommendations to the services hitherto undertaken by the Boards of Guardians, but it is impossible to provide efficiently and economically for such services without taking account, according to the actual circumstances of each county, of the existing provision for the sick that is already made under the Public Health Acts. We suggest that each County Council should be required to prepare, after consultation with the various authorities within its area, a scheme, for the approval of the Local Government Board, showing how it is proposed that the provision for the sick and infirm (including maternity and infancy, and the aged needing institutional care) hitherto provided under the Poor Law should be carried out for every part of the county. As a general principle it is desirable that the whole expense of these services should be borne by the county fund, and. that the County Council should provide and maintain all the institutions, appoint and pay the staffs, and appoint District Committees for local administration under its supervision. Where, hoAvever, a Borough or Urban District has already a hospital, or is already administering any particular health service with efficiency, it might be accorded (in lieu of the County) the functions hitherto undertaken in respect of that service by the Guardians, if it so desired and was willing to bear the whole expense from its own local rates the County expenditure on the corresponding services in the rest of the County area being then charged as for special county purposes. This should, however, in no case be arranged in respect of any Borough under 10,000, or of any Urban District under 20,000 population, for the reason that in the case of all such services as hospitals a large area is needed for economical and efficient provision and administration, and the distribution of the powers here con-templated amongst all the 1,700 borough, urban and rural councils, would render this impossible.XII. The Importance of Complete Unification.25. We suggest that, if such a scheme of unification as we now propose had been carried out 10 years ago, it would not have been necessary either to have instituted such overlapping services as Old Age Pensions or school feeding, or to have established such new Local Authorities as the Local Representative Committee, and the Local War Pensions Committee. The administration of the Old Age Pensions Act would naturally have been entrusted to the Home Assistance Committee, which could easily have appointed a sub-committee to deal with this special class, the investigation of the pecuniary resources of the applicants being undertaken by the Committee&apos;s trained staff. The same staff, aided by the Committee&apos;s Common Register of Public Assistance, could have dealt promptly with the relief of the families of the children at school noticed by the teachers as suffering from insufficient food. On the outbreak of war the same Committee, with the Common Register at its disposal, could have been utilised for the relief of the distress in the home, while the Prevention of Unemployment and Training Committee could have provided the &quot; women&apos;s workrooms &quot; and other institutions for training which were opened under the auspices of the special organisation set up to deal with distress due to the war. On the mobilisation of the army, the staff at the disposal of the Home Assistance Committee, with its Common Register of Public Assistance, would have been of great service in dispensing week by week the separation allowances. At the same time the Committee could, by the aid of a new sub-committee, in which could have been included representatives of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Families Association and similar bodies, have looked after all the families in the case of whom, from whatever cause, any question arose as to their allowance. The Home Assistance Committee would equally have been available for looking after the discharged soldier, paying him his pension and succouring him when the pension was delayed.
26. Looking to the future, it may he suggested that the existence of a Home Assistance Committee entirely unconnected with the Poor Law, and free from any suspicion of using the &quot;Workhouse Test,&quot; or the policy of &quot;deterrence,&quot; would permit of the merging with it at some future elate, both of the Old Age Pensions Committee of the Council and of the Local War Pensions Committee under the Ministry of Pensions ; it would obviate the institution of any new authority or new committee for any new analogous purposes hereafter proposed; and it Avould stand ready for use, in any new emergency, for the local administration of any national fund.27. The adoption of more suitable areas of administration is no less important than the unification of services. The expenditure on Public Assistance has grown enormously in the last 25 years, and included in this expenditure is an increase of 61- millions per annum on Poor Law llelief, which is due in the main to the demand for a higher standard of administration, and particularly to the recognition of the advantage of classification and the appropriate treatment of various classes of recipients of relief, to which both the Majority and Minority Reports of the Royal Commission attributed so much importance. The expenditure on Public Assistance is partly central and partly local, but, as the Committee on Retrenchment in the Public Expenditure (Cel. 8200) observed, &quot; if the national resources are to be conserved &quot; to the fullest possible extent, it is of course necessary that every practicable &quot; economy should be secured in local as well as in central administration.&quot; Such economy cannot be secured unless the whole expenditure out of public funds on Public Assistance is so accounted for that it can be kept under continuous observation in total as well as in detail. The unification of Public Assistance services which we recommend would greatly facilitate such a system of accounting.28. But whatever measures of economy may he necessary we cannot contemplate any withdrawalor reduction of services, advantageous to the com-munity as a whole, which have been conferred by recent legislation. On the contrary, we are disposed to think that the effect of the wrar will be to stimulate the demand for the improvement of social conditions. If the fulfilment of that demand is to be reconciled with the duty of securing both economy, and efficiency in public expenditure, it appears to us imperatively necessary that the reorganisation of public assistance, which we have recommended, should previously have been carried out, based, as we have shown, upon the unification of services, the reduction in the number of separate authorities and the choice of the most suitable area of administration.XIII. Schemes.29. The following are the Schemes drawn up by us for applying to the County Boroughs, the County of London, and the other Administrative Counties, the principles and recommendations set out above)-SCHEME (A.)-COUNTY BOROUGHS.Scheme foe the Transfer, of the Functions of Poor Law Authoritiesin County Boroughs.(1) In each County Borough all functions, property, staff, &amp;.c, of the Boards of Guardians, Joint Committees of Boards of Guardians, and Managers of Poor Law School Districts (hereinafter referred to as Poor Law Authorities) should be trans-ferred to the Town Council.(2) In each County Borough there should be-(a) A Home Assistance Committee, and(b) A Prevention of Unemployment and Training Committee,appointed by the Town Council on the lines of the Education Committee,0 and generally in a similar relation to the Town Council.* By referring to the analogy of tlie Education Committee in connection with tho new Committees under the Scheme it is not intended to prevent the Council from making whatever arrangements they deem desirable for the exercise of functions ancillary to the main purpose of these Committees. Thus, e,g., the appointment of staff, purchasing stores, $c., might be referred to appropriate other Committees.

MEMORANDUM BY MR. R. J. CURTIS.The Committee, before I joined, had taken an irrevocable decision not only to recommend the abolition of Boards of Guardians, but also the transfer of their functions to other Authorities.As a consequence of such decision (all responsibility for which I disclaim) my consideration of the reference to the Committee had to be founded upon the assumption that the Government might deem it necessary to adopt that drastic proposal in . order to concentrate under a single Authority the Multiplicity of services relating to public assistance.Only upon that assumption, and with the following reservations, do I assent generally to the Report: (1) I regard the Report as an instalment of a comprehensive scheme having for its object the avoidance of present and future overlapping in pulbic services., (2) If County, Borough, and other Councils are to be&apos; entrusted with further important functions 1 consider those bodies should be allowed greater freedom, than the recommendations permit of, in allocating the new duties to Committees. A scheme appropriate to Manchester or Birmingham might be found cumbersome and costly for Eastbourne. Similarly a scheme suitable for a County mainly industrial, such as Stafford, might be found unworkable in a Rural County such as Hereford.(3) Under the plan presented by Scheme (C), Counties outside London, it is conceivable that there may be two Health Authorities in the same area (1) the County Council, and (2) either a Borough, Urban, or Rural Council. It may be argued that it will be the duty of the Local Government Board to prevent this when considering schemes submitted, but I should prefer that each County Council should be required to frame their scheme after consultation with the Urban and Rural Ristrict Councils. As far as prac-ticable the areas for District Home Assistance Committees should be co-terminous with Urban or Rural Districts or a combination of those districts.(4) I consider the administration of public funds should be in the hands of persons directly responsible to the electors. I only waive my objection to co-opted members in this instance because I am fully convinced that for some years after the change is made the Councils will, for the efficient performance of their new functions, need the assistance of experienced Guardians.(5) The Report gives no indication, as I think it should have done,&quot;whether expenditure by the Home Assistance Committee should be levied through the &quot;Poor&quot; or other rate. The term &quot; Poor&quot; rate is a misnomer and its use should be discontinued whether Boards of Guardians are abolished or not.Finally, I desire to record my regret that the Poor Law Unions&apos; Association has not been given an opportunity to lay its views, upon the subject, before the Committee.R. J. CURTIS.MEMORANDUM BY MR. G. MONTAGU HARRIS.I have signed this Report, being in complete agreement with its recommenda-tions so far as they go, and fully realising the necessity of confining the recom-mendations of the Committee to fairly wide general principles. At the same time, I should like to point out that the circumstances of the administrative counties, in view of the great overlapping of functions among the numerous authorities, render it especially difficult in their case to deal with one branch only of the subject of
public assistance, or to render the proposed future situation altogether clear without entering into much greater detail as to the relative positions, especially in the matter of Public Health powers, of county councils and minor authorities. The point is alluded to in several paragraphs of the Report, but I. wish to lay special stress upon it, as I think that the elaboration of details in the case of the administrative counties may in many respects, and in individual counties, considerably modify the outline scheme in very important particulars.G. MONTAGU HARRIS.MEMORANDUM BY SIR ROBERT MORANT.I append my signature of agreement to this Report on the following assumptions, which I think I ought to mention here because, though quite compatible with the Report (except possibly my second point), they are not explicit in the text, and perhaps may not be part of: the intentions in the minds of some of the other signatories; in my mind, however, they are essential conditions of the proposed transference of the functions of Poor Law Authorities to other Local Bodies. I assume that before that transference takes place (a) the necessary extension by Parliament and by the Government Depart-ments of the various Acts and arrangements relating to the health of the people shall have been completed, on broad comprehensive lines, for securing the provision in all localities of public services designed to prevent, at least as much as to cure or to mitigate, all forms of ill-health and disease; such various functions, where they are shared between two Local Bodies, to be exercised by them in the closest organic co-operation with one another, by interlocking representation of each on the other and by dovetailed schemes of work; and(b) that (i) the central supervision of such local services for the health ofthe people, (ii) rhe disbursement of the substantial Exchequer Grants towards the cost of these services that is essential for securing their ubiquitous development on progressive lines, and (iii) the Central Departments approval of the local health schemes, which is the key to the attainment of conditions essential to efficient working in the various localities-shall have been vested in a Central Authority, having all the different main forms of medical and ancillary services within the scope of its supervision, under one Minister, i.e., a Ministry of Health for England and Wales, with properly organised Sub-Departments, and having the regular assistance of carefully constituted Advisory Councils composed of men and women versed in, and themselves exercising, the various local activities which the Ministry is to supervise.ROBERT L. MORANT.MEMORANDUM BY MR. HARRY G. PRITCHARD.1. Whilst I have signed the Report, because I agree with the main recom-mendation of the Committee, namely, the merging of the functions of the Poor Law bodies in the municipal and county authorities, I feel bound to record my dissent from some of the proposals contained in it.2. Coimty Boroughs. The scheme relating to county boroughs is in my opinion open to the objection that it involves unnecessary interference with the councils in regard to the manner in which, and particularly the committees through whom, the transferred functions are to be performed. In the past it was the practice of Parlia-ment to confer and impose definite powers and duties upon town councils, and not to tell them how their functions were to be performed or what committees they must appoint; the powers and duties being prescribed by Parliament, the responsibility for finding the best and most suitable method of carrying them out according to the local circumstances was left with the council in each case. A notable example of this policy is the Public Health Act, 1875, whereby most extensive powers are given to urban and rural sanitary authorities, but where Parliament wisely, in myD 2
judgment, refrained from indicating what committee should he appointed to assist in their performance.3. I am aware that more recently Parliament has in some cases interfered with the discretion of local authorities in the appointment of Committees, either by direct enactment or by requiring the approval of schemes by a central department. Personally I think that this is a mistake, and I trust that the practice will not be extended.4. In the present case it is, in my opinion, sufficient to transfer the functions of the Poor Law authorities to the councils of county boroughs, with such modifications and extensions as are desirable (the modifications consisting largely, I trust, of the removal of unnecessary central control) and to empower the councils in performing these functions to make use of their existing statutory committees (for example, the asylums and education committees), and to appoint such other committees as they may think necessary. If this course is not adopted, not only will unnecessary difficulties be placed in the way of councils in the performance of onerous duties, hut there is the real fear that the new statutory committees, and particularly the home assistance committees, will be regarded as the old poor law authority under a new name.5. London. As regards London, it will in my opinion be necessary for the scheme to indicate with a considerable degree of precision the division of functions between the County Council and the Borough Councils, and to some extent also the policy and rules of local administration, so as to minimise the prospect of differences between the two classes of local authorities. In this connection I should not regard the original scheme as a final document; it would be capable of such modification as experience may from time to time suggest and as may be approved by the Local Govern ment Board.6. I also doubt the necessity for transferring all the existing institutions to the County Council; probably in the majority of cases it would be convenient for these institutions to be in the hands of that Council, so as to be available for the whole area, but there may be instances where they could be better managed by the Borough Councils.7. I also think that provision should be made for the settlement by the Local Government Board of any difference that may arise between the County Council and any Borough Council, particularly in regard to the payments to be made to the latter, and other financial matters; I anticipate that the right of appeal would be rarely exercised, but that if the right exists the parties are more likely to come to an agreement.8. Counties outside London. The case of the counties outside London presents greater difficulties, and here the Committee have, I think, failed to make sufficient use of the existing local authorities, the borough and district councils. The establish-ment of separate district committees appointed by the County Council, each presumably having its own staff and operating in precisely the same area as an existing local authority, who also has its own staff, would, in my opinion, neither secure better co-ordination nor effect economy or efficiency.9. As regards medical assistance, I entirely dissent from the proposal that this should be given by the staff of the county medical officer of health, except in the cases of certain boroughs and urban districts, which are apparently to be regarded as exceptional, where the Local Government Board direct the functions to be performed by the borough and district councils. I express no opinion in regard to the rural areas, because my acquaintance with the administration of public health in those areas is insufficient to enable me to do so, but as regards boroughs and urban districts I am convinced that the proposal to have two health authorities, viz., the County Council and the Borough or District Council, both administering the Public Health Acts and both dealing to a large extent with the same subjects and even, in many cases, with the same persons, would, if carried out, give rise to much friction and dissatisfaction and to unnecessary expenditure. The borough and district councils have been the executive health authorities for very many years, and generally speaking it will not, I think, be denied that their administration has been successful. They have acquired experience, they have their medical officers, sanitary inspectors and other officers and all the necessary machinery; they have, of course, an intimate knowledge of their own
areas, and in ray opinion they are the authorities to whom the services in question should be transferred. I cannot, therefore, agree with the proposal that the-medical services should be rendered by the borough and district councils only in exceptional cases.10. No doubt the institutions in many possibly in the majority of cases would have to be administered either by the County Council or by a combination of district councils so that full use may be made of them, but I have no doubt that there are some buildings, e.g., infirmaries, which could be utilised to the greatest advantage if transferred to the councils of the towns in which they are situate. M v.,11. The difficulties in the case of the Counties of deciding the best course :to adopt arises from the fact that they differ so largely that it is impossible to put forward a scheme applicable to all cases. That being so, it will, I think, be best to follow the proposal made with reference to London, to the extent of requiring each County Council to frame, in conjunction with the Borough and District Councils, a scheme for dividing amongst the several Councils the functions and the institutions transferred from the Guardians.12. Enlargement of Committees. I also differ from the proposal contained in the report, that provision should be made for including upon committees of a Town Council persons who are not members of the Council. It is, I think, very desirable that a committee should comprise only persons who are responsible for the adminis-tration of the whole of the Councils affairs, and can take, therefore, a broad view upon any question coming before the committee, and who will be able to support in the Council any acts of the committee when they come up for confirmation or are called in question. Moreover, the inclusion on a committee of the Council of persons that are not members of the Council, is not in accordance with the principle of representation upon which the constitution of the Council is based.13. Assessment Committees. Finally (and here there is, I think, no substantial difference between the remainder of the Committee and myself), I trust that it will not be necessary to give effect to the proposal for the appointment of Assessment Committees by the County Councils. This is expressed in the report to be put forward only pending an amendment of the law relating to the valuation of property, and I hope, therefore, that this amendment will be effected prior to, or contem-poraneously with, the other amendments of the law which will be necessary to effect the transfer of the Guardians&apos; functions.HARRY G.

TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS OF POOR LAW AUTHORITIES.RECOMMENDATIONS.The Abolition of the Boards of Guardians.We recommend the abolition of the Boards of Guardians and of the Boor Law ,   Union, and the merging of all the functions of the Boor Law Authorities in those -of the County Council and the County Borough Council, subject to the necessary modifications set out in our schemes for London and the other administrative counties.The Unification of Existing Services. We recommend that (a) The provision at the expense of the rates, with or without Exchequer - - Grants, for the sick and infirm (including maternity and infancy andthe aged requiring institutional care, and all institutions appropriated to any of these) should be made by the Council under Public Health Acts suitably extended. The Council should organise such preventive and curative treatment as the cases individually require by means of their specialised institutions and medical staff.(h) The provision for all children able to attend school (including residential and special schools of all kinds) should be regarded as predominantly a matter of educational training, and should be made by the Local Education Authority under the Education Acts suitably extended.(c) The provision for the mentally deficient, and for persons of unsound mind whether certified or not, including all institutions appropriated to these classes, should be made by the Council under the Lunacy and Mental Beficiency Acts, suitably extended, and through the Committee or Committees administering their powers under these Acts.The Unemployed Abie-Bodied.We recommend that the County or County Borough Council, as the case may be, should be required to appoint, in substitution for the existing authorities under the Boor Law and under the Unemployed Workmen Act, a neio Committee, to be entitled &quot; The Brevention of Unemployment and Training Committee,&quot; formed on the lines of the Education Committee, and including representatives of Employers&apos; Associations and of Organised Labour. The Committee should exercise the powers of the Council as to if) preventing unemployment (so far as practicable, and subject to service require-ments and due economy) by procuring such a rearrangement of the CounciVs toorks and services as to regularise the local demand for labour; (ii) facilitating through the Employment Exchanges the finding of situations; (m). making use of any form of educational training in co-operation as much as possible with the Education Committee ; (iv) assisting migration; and (v) creating and administering, tvhether by themselves or in federation with other Local Authorities, any specialised provision of the kind required by the unemployed.The Home Assistance Committee.We recommend that the County or County Borough Council, as the case may be, should be required to appoint a new Committee, to be styled &quot; the Home Assistance Committee,&quot; formed on the lines of the Education Committee (including persons experienced in the work to be done, and, in the first instance, some who have been members of Boor Law Authorities), which should be charged with (i) the duty of making the necessary enquiries into the economic circumstances of applicants for or recipients of any form of assistance in money, kind, or service, wholly or partly provided out of rates or taxes, eligibility for which is dependent on the pecuniary need of the person or family concerned, or for which payment is legally recoverable; (ii) general supervision of recipients of such assistance and their dependants; (iii) the administration of all such assistance in money or kind given in the home of the applicant; (iv) the exercise of the powers of the guardians of acquiring tlie rights and powers of parents as regards any children maintained by them who are orphans or whose parents are unM to have the care of them; (v) the duty of seeking in co-operation with the
appropriate committee institutional treatment for any applicant or the dependant of any applicant for whom such treatment is required; (vi) the recovery from persons liable by law of expenses in respect of accommodation, maintenance, treatment, and services rendered; and (vii) the duty of keeping a register (which should nofbe open to public inspection) of all families within the area, any member of which is in receipt of assistance as above defined, together with particulars of such assistance.Compensation for Officers Displaced or Injuriously affected.We recommend that the officers of the Boor Law Authorities should be trans-ferred to the County and County Borough Councils under schemes to be approved by the Local Government Board, the Councils and the officers both having an option as to transfer; and that suitable provision should be made for the adequate com-pensation of all such officers as may suffer direct pecuniary loss owing either to abolition of office or to a diminution or loss of emoluments in fees, salary, or allow-ances. The tenure of office and all rights of superannuation of existing officers who are transferred should be fully protected.Supplementary Provisions.We recommend that the property and liabilities of all Boor Law Authorities should be allocated among the Councils concerned, or any combinations of them, by the Local Government Board, or by some person appointed by them, after these Councils have had an opportunity of effecting a mutual arrangement.We recommend that pending the amendment of the law relating to the valuation of property, the power of appointing the Assessment Committees should be transferred to the County and County Borough Councils, and throughout London to the Metro-politan Borough Councils. The Councils should determine through which of their committees, not being the Home Assistance Committee, they will administer any functions of the Boards of Guardians or combinations of Boards of Guardians (including those under the Vaccination and Births and Deaths Registration Acts) not already specified; provided that all functions relating to Health, Education, the provision for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency and the provision for Unemployment respectively should be administered exclusively under the several Acts relating thereto, suitably extended, and through the Committees dealing with such Acts.D 4
APPENDIX.Assistance of the Able-bodied, including Vagrants.1. While it is perhaps not strictly within the province of tho Committee to formulate a policy for the treatment of the able-bodied unemployed, or for the solution of the vagrancy problem, the question of machinery cannot be wholly dissociated from the question of the policy which the machinery is to subserve. Nor will the plan of administration suggested by the Committee be intelligible without some explanation of the principles underlying it.2. The scheme which the Committee have recommended for the treatment of the sick is based on a recognition of the principle that these persons require assistance because they are sick, and that they should accordingly be dealt with in a manner best calculated to restore them to health. Similarly the Committee contemplate that the able-bodied unemployed require assistance by reason of their unemployment, and that they should accordingly be dealt with in a manner best calculated to restore them to, or fit them for, employment.3. With this object in view the Committee have recommended the institution of a &quot;Prevention of Unemployment and Training Committee,&quot; which is to work in close conjunction with the Local Advisory Committee of the Employment Exchange and to procure such training for the able-bodied unemployed person as will best fit him to obtain employment.4. When an able-bodied man or woman applies for assistance on the ground that he or she is unemployed, the first step should be to ascertain through the Employment Exchange whether any suitable employment is available, and, if so, to endeavour to place the applicant in such employment. If, however, there is no vacancy which the applicant can fill, or none which he can fill without training, he should be given a real opportunity of training which will either improve his skill in his own trade or fit him to obtain employment in a new trade. The Committee attach the utmost importance to the absence of any quality of deterrence from the offer of training, and for this, amongst other reasons, they suggest that the: best results will generally be attained by providing training, not in special institutions, exclusively devoted to the recipients of assistance, but in institutions open to and in fact used by other classes of the community. Thus, for example, instead of establishing special farm colonies for the unemployed, it would be preferable that men who are to be trained in agriculture should receive their training in existing farm colonies or other similar institutions to which members of the general public are admitted, and,that men and women who are to be trained in other trades should receive their training in existing trade schools, polytechnics, workshops, &amp;c. It is understood that a similar policy has been adopted by the&quot;;Ministry of Pensions in regard to the training of disabled men.&quot;5. While, however, no effort should be spared to make the offer of training attractive, it is recognised that powers will be needed for dealing with persons who refuse to accept the training or the employment that is offered to them.   For these it may be necessary to establish detention colonies.6. A detention order would only be justified on proof of wilful aud persistent repetition within a given period of &quot;any of the following offences : (1) Wilful refusal or neglect of persons to maintain themselves or their families (although such personsare wholly or in part able to do so). (2) Wilful refusal on the part of a person receiving assistance to perform the work or to observe theregulations duly prescribed in regard to such assistance. (3) Wilful refusal to comply with the conditions laid down by the authority granting assistance, uponwhich assistance can be obtained.It is suggested that the detention order should be obtained from a magistrate, and that there should be a right to appeal to quarter sessions.7. The able-bodied vagrant should be dealt with on similar lines ; that is to say, he should be afforded a reasonable opportunity of obtaining either employment or training, and in case of wilful persistent refusal he should be committed to a detention colony. For the vagrant who is not able-bodied suitable treatment should be provided by the appropriate Committee.8. It is thought that not more than one or two detention colonies would be required for the whole country. The management of these colonies should probably be entrusted either to some one existing Government Department or to a special body on which the various Government Departments concerned would be represented.9. It may, perhaps, be hoped that, with a development and extension of the Employment Exchanges and a tightening-up of their machinery, coupled possibly with a more complete system of national registration, there will in future he less excuse for tramping in search of work, and greater facilities for detecting and penalising those who use this excuse merely to cover their disinclination for honest work.10. But local authorities will be reluctant to take proceedings, magistrates will hesitate to convict, and public opinion will refuse to endorse repressive measures until the vagrant is deprived of all excuse for wandering. In the meantime, therefore, some substitute for the casual ward will have to be provided, where the homeless traveller can obtain temporary lodging. Without expressing a decided opinion on this point, the Committee are disposed to think that, if municipal common lodging houses are established in all large centres of population, the problem might be solved in this way, the case of any vagrant who was unable to pay for his lodging being referred to the Home Assistance Committee.Printed under the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office By Eyre and Spottiswoode, Ltd., East Harding Street, E.C.4, Printers to the King&apos;s most Excellent Majesty.
