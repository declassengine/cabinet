Ily surest ion is designed to produce the maximum of terror, with the minimum, destruction of women and children.    Its main points are as follows(1)   Announce that in consequence of recent devastations in France and Belgium, and as a first step in the direction of just punishment to the offenders, the Allies propose to subject one or more of (say five) selected towns to systematic bombing.(2)   Tftie^give (three) days clear notice of their intention in order to permit&apos; women and children to leave the threatened areas.    After this they will proceed to action at the times&quot;and seasons most convenient to themselves.The result of this threat (which should be officially communicated through neutrals, and to which the utmost publicity should be given) will be to create the greatest panic in the selected towns:   none of which will know which will be the victim, Equal -precautions will have to be taken in all of them, and in all of thorn equal confusion will probably prevail.The attack, when made, should be as prolonged and as formidable as possible.    Ho attempt should be&quot;made to confine it to objectives of military importance.    For the end to be attained is not military success, but the cessation of wanton outrages;   and the more we can bring home to the German people that vre can do something to make our punishment match their crimes, the more likely it is that their crimes will cease.Among what I conceive to be the merits of the plan, 1 count: (1) the fact that it is capable of immediate execution, and need not wait till more complete justice becomes possible at the end of the war;   (2) that it raises to a maximum the element of expectant terror;   (5) that it reduces to a minimum tho injury to children;   (4) that it can be increased in exact proportion to our increasing air superiority;   (5) that it is capable of indefinite repetition.    I hope therefore that the Cabinet and the llinistry of Air will give it due consideration&apos;.(Intd.)   A. J. B.F0REXG1T OFFICE,8th October, 1918.
