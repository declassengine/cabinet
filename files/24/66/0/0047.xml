INDUSTRIAL   DEMOBILISATION. Memorandum by the Ministor of Labour,.1.   I desire to make tho following observations on tho note circulated *o the Cabinet by the Minister of Munitions on 1st. October. 1918. (G.2V5863).i2.   In the second paragraph of the note the principle is laid down that &quot;the manufacture of munitions should not continue for a single   v day longer than is absolutely nocossary and economically justifiable. I am fully in accord with tho prinoiplo, but it seems necessary to point out that, tfte responsibility of the Ministry of kunitions as regards industrial demobilisation will not be discharged unless adequate Bteps arc taken for ensuring that dismissals of workpeople in accordance with the principle are regulated in such a manner as to cause the least amount of avoidable hardship to individuals and to offer them the best possible chance of earltf re-absorption in other work.    The danger to be guarded against is that the managements of the factories, when instructed to arrange for the discharge of their workpeople, will regard it as their primary duty to make such arrangements as will reduoo to a minimum the wages charged falling to the factory, and will pay no regard or insufficient regard to the desirability of co-ordinating the discharges with tho demands for labour elsewhere.    They may, for instance, discharge the least competent workers first and keep the most competent till the end, notwithstanding that the latter may bo in demand elsewhere, or may not need to continue in industrial employment.5.   Three things ought to be done:-(1) Adequate notice of discharge should be given to each individual worker.(2) Adequate notice of the discharges ought to be given to the Employment Exchanges.* -(3) The orddr of discharge of the individual workers in eachcase ought to be regulated in accordance with a scheme agree^ beforehand with the officials of the Employment Department and the Local Advisory Committee representative of employers and employed.4.  As regards the first point viz. notice of discharge to the Individual worker, at least a fortnights notice should, be given in every case, or a fortnights wages in lieu of notice.5,   As regards the second point viz, notice to the Employment Exchanges, the names of the workpeople to whom notice of discharge has been given should be notified forthwith to the local Employment Exchange (or other equivalent arrangements made for keeping the Exchange informed of these names) and in addition the longest possible notice should be given in a^ance to the Exchange of the probable numbers to be discharged at various dates with the fullest available information as to the occupations concerned./ 6. As
6.   As regards the third point vU. reflation of tho order of discharge of Individual workers, it is most important that the discharges of workers from factories Bho Jd be regulated primarily in the interests of the early re-absorption of the workers and the avoidanae of individual hardship^ rather than on the linos of a &quot;business transaction&quot;, with a view to reducing the cost to the particular faotory concerned^    I strongly recommend, therefore, that this principle should bo definitely adopted by the Minister of Munitions, and that imperative instructions should be issued by hira to ensure that it is oarriod into effect,    ttome extra cost in respect of tho individual factories will necessarily be entailed, but this cost will be far less1 than the charge that would have to be Shouldered by the State in the wafr of unemployment benefit or some &quot; other form of euatenation if the dischargee take  lace on a purely business principle.The precise methods according to which the discharges should be. regulated must vary within fairly wido limits according to the circumstances of each particular case.    They should be laid down in 1 advanoe in each ease in consultation botween tho management of the factory and the officials of the local Bmplo.yn.ent Exchange assisted by the Local Advisory Committee representative of employers and employed in the aroa.    As an indication, however, of the lines on which they might prooeed, the following are mentioned as instances of classes of workers who might be marked down for early discharge, though not necessarily in the order here given, whioh is subject to variation according to looal circumstances -(1) Workers not dependent on industrial employment for a livelihood;(Z) Workers who havo been brought from a distance;(3) Workers who can be readily absorbed in their previous occupation, or in one of the staple industries of the district.It is most important that the previous industrial experience of the workpeople who are to be dismissed end the demand for work-people of their experience elsewhere should be adequately considered by the factory managements in consultation with the officials of the Ministry of Labour before the selection of the individuals to be discharged at particular dates is made,7*   Subject to these observations, I agree with the suggestions in Paragraph 4 of the note circulated by the Minister of ivfunitions with regard to the matters for whioh the responsibility should fall on my Department.(Signed) Geo.H. Roberts.;nao.io.
