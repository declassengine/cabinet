Wo venture to suggest, therefore, that, in order to assist the Law Officers in this task, it might be well to appoint forthwith a strong Committee of Jurists and others, whoso appointment mi?ht bo announced, and who might at once proceed with their work.     Such a Committee, we would further suggest, might well.include the following membersProfessor Sir.. T ,&quot;3. Hoi land,      Jr. Coleman Phillipson, . Lord Brycc, Sir ISrlo Richards., K,C.,Mr. Oppenhcim, . Mr. CFcGill, K.C.,. &quot;Professor Morgan, .fir, Travors Humphreys,,&apos; and a Representative cf the Foreign Office and tho Admiralty.It is understood that the War Office proposes, if a Committee is appointed,, to nominate Professor Morgan who is a staff officer.It is understood that a French Committee is working with similar aims and suitable liaison would of course bo established.Yours sincerely,(Signed)     Frederick Smith,(Signed)     Gordon Hewart,
