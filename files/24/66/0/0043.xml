 ^\ bmjbiaem qf m; am A&amp;nsa-/.h T r/t/fi \.JL.: ...        ........        . .IS DoCMTOiaiis thftroperty of /Sates in connection nth the Seoond Regie toy.sirn-i.^Memorandum by the President of the Local Government Board.The Act lays down fixed dates for the preparation of two Electoral Registers a year.   Under it the spring Register which relates to a qualifying period of six months ending on the 15th January is due to come into force on the 15th ;.pril and the autumn register which relates to a qualifying period of eix months ending on the 15th July is to come into force on the 15th Odtober.Special dates had to be fixed for the first Register dependent on the date at which the Act passed and on the need for additional time owing to the exceptional difficulties to be encountered.   The qualifying period was from the 15th October, 1917, to 15th April, 1913, and the Register came into operation at the  beginning of the current month.   My previous proposals for the second Register were intended to bring the dates for that Register as near as was practicable into harmony with the normal dates of the Act.   I accordingly proposed in my memorandum of the 30th September that the aeoond Register should oome into operation on the statutory date, the 15th April, 1919.   But looking to the extreme difficulty under whioh the work will have to be done (shortage of staff, shortage of payer and coal, dark evenings and printing difficulties) I felt that It would be impossible to expect the Register to be ready by the 15th April if the qualifying period ended on the 15th January.   I therefore proposed that the qualifying period should be allowed to end on 15th December thus allowing four months between the end of the qualifying period and the date of the operation of the Register in place of the three months allowed under the Act for normal times.I am convinced that lt would be quite impossible to suggest a shorter period than four months for this Intervali - and in this opinion I am fortified by the unanimous opinion of my Advisory Conference, - and if the view of the Cabinet is that the end of the qualJLfying--periocL should be the statutory date, 15th January instead of the 15th December ae I had suggested! it will be necessary to make the date of operation of the Register the 15th May.   So far ae next year is oonoerned the 15th May would probably serve ae well aa the 15th April, but the fixing of the 15th May would mean that the second Register would only have&amp;a currency of five months instead of six, as the third Register will be due to come into operation on the 15th Ootober, 1919.&apos; j X shall be glad to have the ooneent of the/  liar Cabinet to the dates now proposed -Qualifying period - 15th July 1918 to 15th January 1919. Seoond Register to oome into operation - 15th May, 1919.The Secretary for Scotland concurs in the change. Ireland is not affected aa there le only one register a year in that country.W. HAYES FI9HER.Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W.I., 11th Ootober, 1918.
