(THIS DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEHMMEKT) .1 H-tiiwpmwwtM - nil&apos;-w- p      nw i.........*m i in-&apos; - ti tW n&quot; t&quot;   i&quot;Tnr -  ------- vr------------&apos; i   i---r - r        i i.     mmm        \       mi i m  um i  i   irSECRET.WAR CABINET.G.T. 5905.CONTROL OF PPICAI BOARDS DEALING WITH AWARD OF PENSIONS.(Memorandupi &quot;by - S ir lidwin Cornwall) .1.   I have given oortsideration to the Minute and Memorandum (6.,Tr5609) submitted by the Minister tf Pensions on September 13th, to the War Cabinet dealing with a question which/ is at issue between that Ministry and the Ministry of National Service as t* certain medical servicesj and also the Memorandum (M.S.R.48 G.Ti5832) submitted to the Cabinet by the Minister Wf National Service dated September 28th dealing with the same subject.   The , latter Memorandum refers speoifically to a matter which is of great importance to the wcrk of National Health Insurance, and to which I and my Department have been giving close and con-timwus attention for a long time past, namely the grave deple-tion tf medical man-pewer available for the oivilian needs of this country.   This depletion has now proceeded so far that I feel it my duty to draw the attention ef the Cabinet to it, in connection with their consideration of the matters dealt with in the Memoranda referred to.2.   I desire to confirm in the strongest possible manner from the point of view of this Department the considerations advanced by Sir Auckland Geddes (especially in his first, second and fifth paragraphs) as to the urgent necessity of refraining from any changes or any new arrangements of medical services which would in any way occasion any avoidable further demand upon the deplorably few doctors now remaining for the needs of the teivil population.3,   I do not seek to enter into the merits or demerits of the particular proposal of the Ministry of pensions for the organisation of their medical services.   But I would venture to suggest that the danger of a breakdown in the maintenance at a bare minimum of oivilian medical services is now so great (particularly in view of the present most pressing need for more doctors for the Armies on the Western Front) as to make it necessary for the Ministry of Pensions to have regard to the actual position fif things throughout the country and how these arrangements may affect the responsibilities and the position of the Government through these other Departments.4.   The difficulty I am emphasising is a very real one, and there is considerable danger of its being overlooked cr regarded as negligible by ether Departments and persons v/ho are engaged in work at present more directly affeoted by war con-ditions. -While that point of view is of great national importance it must not result in the ether obligations of the Government being overlooked and in this conneotion it must be remembered that the medical services essential to National Health Insurance must be iiept going&apos;during the war.   Any general failure in these would oertainly on gender grave dis-oontent throughout the country.   It is true that under the . pressure of war conditions we&apos;have felt bound to give every assistance v/e could manage, to the Army Council in regard to
doctors-and have therefore acquiesced in a certain amount of &quot;&quot;sagging down&quot;&apos; in tho kind&apos; of services rendered to the insured population.   But&apos;there is obviously a &quot;bare minimum standard in this respect which the Government cannot afford to forego; to do no,  on whatever pretext,, would place the Government not only in a difficult but also in a wrong position.5.   attention has been drawn to this matter on various previous occasions by my. Department,. and wo havo had occasion to bring to the notice of the War Office, and later of the Ministry of National Service, the impossibility of permitting the abstracting from civil practice of any largo proportion of the few doctors still remaining available, particularly in some Of the industrial centres, and the consequent necessity of adopting as economical a distribution of medical man-power in His Majesty1a Forces as can possibly he&apos; contrived.   Various changes have recently been carried out by the War Office, on response to representations of this nature; and. this would seem to afford additional reason for&apos;now avoiding any steps which might put the Ministry of Pensions into tho position of seeming to frame the measure of their requirements upon lines exceeding the limits of the absolute bare necessities of the case,6*   As an illustration&apos; of the gravity of the present position of the civilian medical service, and the impossibility of contemplating any further reduction in the number of doctors that could by means of any reasonable alternatives be avoided, it may be mentioned that in such an important industrial centre as Bolton there are now only Some, 55 general practitioners left available, as compared with some 95 practising there before the War; in Oldham the number has been reduced from 92 to 58, in Gate ahead, from 49 to 30. - And it must be remembered that winter is approaching, when the strain upon the service of . civilian doctors, oven in peace time, is always considerably greater than during the rest of the year, and there is ample evidence.of the. strain which present conditions are already imposing on the members of the profession remaining in civil practice.   Oases have been brought to light in the course of the Department*s administrative work showing that doctors who havo been at work practically without a break since the beginn ing of the War are now working (through the absence of their partners or colleagues in the Army) for 12, 13, or 14 hours a day; and instances in which a serious breakdown of health ha,a resulted have not been infrequent,   From the point of view of the patients, the position is in some districts no less grave. Complaints of overcrowding in surgeries and of long hours of waiting for medical attention are frequently made.   In the case of one important industrial town, the Department was recently informed by the local body responsible for administering the medical service that.queues of people were at times to be seen waiting outside the surgeries of the doctors up to 11,30 p.m. -a state of affairs which was the more dangerous since in many instances such persons, being in an early stage ofillness, had eome straight from their work in the hot atmosphere of the mills.7*   With a view to mitigating this strain and to organising tho distribution of civilian medical services on as strictly, economical a basis as can by any expedients be contrived, my Department has been stron -ly pressed to permit a considerable abrogation of. the insured persons&apos; rights in regard to medical treatment, by the establishment of Central Surge rU a, where insurance patients are to seek, treatment from a small rota of
-  o -doctors attendin i specially at one centre and arranged in such a manner as to compress into one place and into a reduced number cf hours tho work usually done by several doctors at convenient hours in different districts of&apos; the town.   The great disadvantagi and consequent discontent certain to arise from such schemes havt compelled me to consider their sanction with the greatest eautioi and the matter is.at the moment under the close consideration of my Department in toncert with the Medical Department of the Ministry of National Service and the Central Medical War Oomnitti of the profession.   I mention it here only as indicating the ver; great pressure now existing, in response to the needs of the-Army, for the utmost possible reduction of medical services amongst the civilian population.8B   From all the above aonsiderations,  therefore, I feel . bound in the interests of the real needs of the industrial population, and,  not least, cf the health Of the munition workers, the shipbuilders, the coal miners, and others directly needed for &quot;vanning the war,&quot; to urge the Cabinet to impose the utmost possible stringency in the scrutiny by Nthe Ministry of National Service of any proposals for taking any further doctors from civilian practice, or resorting to any medical organisation that would entail any avoidable increase in the number cf doctors to be employed in wholes-time service and thus prevented from being available to help in the general needs cf the civilian community.(sgd.)   mm OORNWALL.National Health Insurance Join Committee, Buckingham Gate, S,W. 7th October, 1918.
