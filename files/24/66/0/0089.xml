The Treasury has been approached by the Board cf Trade with regard to the probable unemployment which will follow the &quot;cuts&quot; in the munitions programme and has suggested that the Committee of Ministers referred to above,, over whioh the President of the Board of Trade presides,  should be asked to examine the question,   I agree that this is the best course provided the Financial Secretary to the Treasury is added to the Committee.As the existing Committee is based upon.no specific reference, there should be no difficulty in their considering and reporting upon the questions arising out of Government constracts.I therefore ash the war Cabinet&apos;s approval of the addition of the Financial Secretary of the Treasury to the Committee.(Intd.)
