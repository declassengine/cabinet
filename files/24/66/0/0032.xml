PrntH^rfV OYinner!Session of the Allied Maritime Transport Council was held at Lancaster House on September 30th and October 1st and 2nd, Lord Robert Cecil and Sir ^oseph Maclay-representing Great Britain; Mr, Baker the United States Secretary of WarI Lord Reading, and M, Tardieu were present during the discussion of the Supply Programme of the American Army,   The Council unanimously arrived at tne following decisions, subject to the assent of the respective Governments Cooperation of America in the work of the Council and of the associated Inter-Allied organi3ations,That America should with the European Allies table her programmes of Imports for joint consideration by the Allied Programme Committees and her tonnage for similar joint consideration by the Allied Maritime Transport Council, and enable her representatives on these bodies to consider adjustments in the programmes of her Imports and the allocation of her tonnage,That in order to secure (1) in the immediate future addition-al tonnage for the American Army Supply Service, and (2) later to meet the accumulated European deficit and to supply commodities vitally needed by any one of the four countries, America, like the European Allies, should be guided In the arrangement of her Import Services and the disposition of her tonnage by the information and recommendations of the Programme Committees and the Transport Council, with the definite intention of utilising this&apos; Allied Machinery in order to achieve the objects unanimously agreed on by the Paris Conference, viz:-(l)   To make the most economical use of tonnage under the control of all the Allies.(2)   To allot that tonnage as betvjeen the different needs of the Allies in such a way as to add most to the general War effort, and
(3)   To adjust the programmes of requirements of the different Allies in such a way as to bring them within the scope of the possible carrying power of the tonnage available.(Mr. Baker stated that there would be no difficulty whatever in committing the American Government &quot;and indeed I do commit the American Government&quot; to the co-operation contemplated in the foregoing resolutions, subject of course to the reservation .   which is inherent in the constitution of the Council, that America like the other Allies retains ultimate control of her tonnage).Munitions in Yiinter.   Food afterwards.3, That during the later Autumn and Winter a general preferenceshall be given to the transport of munitions and Army supplies as compared with food.4. ,. That, when necessary, but as late as possible withoutrunning undue risk of actual shortage of food, a similar preference .shall be given to the transport of food in the spring or early summer.&apos;Reduction of Stocks. .5. - That, in view 6t the prospect of substantial improvementin the whole Allied tonnage position by next, summer,, and in order to avoid reducing the shipment of essential commodities required for actual consumption during the year up to August (particularly Munitions), all Supply Departments should be asked to effect a reduction of stocks until they approximate, towards the end of August, to the quantities required for actual distribution.(This resolution is of general application, and is of most importance in relation to nitrates, cereals, sugar and oil seeds.) Food.* That 18.5 million tons of importations of all articlesincluded in the Food *Programme, except Military oats, should be confirmed as the figure for the year.In
\o )In recommending this figure the Council had before them from the Food Council the definite statement of the British Representative that, on their present estimates, which allow for a substantial increase in the slaughtering of cattle and pigs and for the restriction of imported foodstuffs to the needs of the dairyherds, the present British proportion of the 18,5. viz.. 10,5 will not prove a possible figure,Recognising the possibility that the policy recommended&apos; (viz., working on the basis of 18.5 and shipping less than the proportion of that quantity during the earlier months)may result in a really serious food position later in the cereal year, the Council agreed-7. That if the food position at the end of the winter orlater shows such a course to be necessary in order to avoid food shortage, food shipments shall have priority in erxess of the proportion due on the 18.5 basis at the expense of tonnage allotted to other services,8, That for the purpose of considering the tonnage available. for other services the total Importations of food (and all other article^ included in the Food Programme), Including all miscellaneous foodstuffs and military oats, should- be provisionally estimated at 22 million tons.(in regard to military oats the Food Council have not yet completed their enquiry of the Military Authorities, and in the meantime, pending a final decision. Importations will continue on a provisional basis which /ill result in an importation by the end of December of between 900,000 and 1,000,000 tons), Munitions,9, That In estimating vihat is available for the European:       Munitions imports it should be provisionally assumed that any tonnage assistance rendered to America, whether by the allocation of ships or the supply of artillery, will be returned within the cereal year, thus leaving 18 x million &amp; tons for European munitions, including ore, pyrites, phosphate &amp; -Ujl(pvV \jdCL g\c UaV 1^ rock,
rock, railway material, and lubricating oil, but that itshould be recognised that this requires reconsideration after examination of the munitions programme, and in particular of the arrangements there proposed for supplies to the American forces.(It should be -added that in order to comply with the request of the Munitions Council for as- larg* an importation as possible during the next 6 months, instructions were given to the Executive to accord a general priority to munitions over food and a special priority to those elements of the munitions group which are regarded as specially urgent by the Munitions Council,)Raw Materials,10 That the principle provisionally approved at the lastsession for r&amp;tf materials, vit,, that actual recorded consumption of .last year should be taken as setting the maximum limit for programmes for the ensuing year should continue to be applied.Supply Programme for the American Army,11, That the Council should not recommend at this momentany reduction in the embarkation of American soldiers in spite of the grave condition of the import programmes, but should be prepared to recommend such a reduction, if necessary , in the embarkations of next year in order to meet any crisis that may arise in the imports of food or other supplies at the time,12, That the Council, having before it the followingprovisional allocations of tonnage for arrival fromSeptember to December, inclusive, viz :-Pood, including Military Oats, 7 million tons. Munitions and Raw Materials, 9 Million tons^recommends that approximately 500,000 tons be diverted fromthe above allocation for the American Army programme forOctober, November, and December, including the 200,000 tonsalready airanged, but in addition to any further space thatcan
can be provided by the release of double bottoms. Coal,That the strongest recommendations should be made to the British Government as to the immense importance to the entire Allied supply position of increasing the production of coal.(A further report will be made on thi3 resolution).Publicity.That in view of the severe sacrifices that must in any event be entailed if the American military p3-?egrannie is continued a full statement of the position should be issued to the public of the four countries, this.statement emphasising the fact that it is the supreme importance of increasing the Allied forces in France which is the reason for the sacrifices asked for, and that, these sacrifices are likely to be required only during the winter and spring, the supply position being thereafter in all probability greatly improved.(a further report will be made on this resolution.)Association of other Allies with the Council.,It was decided to invite the Belgian, Brazilian, Portuguese and Greek Government to nominate a liaison officer to keep in touch with the Executive of the Council,That the Allies, should assume a joint responsibility for the transport of Italian recruits from America to Italy.Lord Robert Cecil and Sir Joseph Maclay in assenting to the foregoing decisions, accepted responsibility for recommending them for acceptance by the British Government . and accordingly now submit that they should be so accepted^x Later information from the Munitions Council showing that a reduction of the. nitrate programme is contemplated, it may be taken that the relief obtained by the diminution of imports from the distant source of Chili        renders possible a total Importation of 18 million tons from sources of an average distance.
