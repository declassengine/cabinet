(This documem?;^4&amp;ff,*^^ of Hie Britannic MajestyVs&apos; Government)WAR   CABINET.teQRET. THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.Memorandum by the Minister of Re construct ion. The Memorandum circulated by the Foreign Office (E.D.D.CV 31) calls attention to the fact that the term&quot;League of Nations1&apos; is coming to be used with two distinct signlficationt. It is employed by some persons-to mean a League to enforce peace -as, for example, by Lord ?hillimore&apos;s Committee - and by others to . mean an economic alliance.   It is obvious that the creation of conditions affording, or even seeming to afford, security from war must have its Influence upon any programme of reconstruction. If for no ether reason than that by diminish! expenditure on armaments would by so much make possible expenditure of a more , fruitful kind,   On the other hand, any scheme for an Economic Alliance mu3t involve tho consideration of a number of problems which are essentially problems of reconstruction.. I wish therefore to put on record at this stage some suggestions as to the manner and method in which the consideration of a League of Nations should be approached.The Report of Lord Phiiiimore53 Committee leaves entirely on one side all questions other than those of creating the machinery to prevent war.   I understand that it is shortly to be submitted to the consideration of the Allied Governments and that it has already been shown to Wesident Wilson, &quot;who is preparing a Memorandum upon It.   It will, of course, have to be considered side by side with the proposals of the        ..   Frenoh Committee.   These latter proposals, however, raise, as tho Report of Lord PhillimorVs Committee does not, the question of economic policy.It would, I think, be unwise that the work of a Leagueof/i 1
I 2 i 22.ef Nations established for the purpose of securing peace should incur at the outset the risk of the unpopularity attendant upon the commercial and industrial hostility which may arise out of an^ control which an economic association &apos;  might have to exercise in some directions in the early tran-sltional period.On that account it seems to be most desirable that, in the first instance, economic questions should be kept - separate from the question of enforcing peace.   Any economic arrangement, on the other hand, whatever its character, is bound to be suspected from the beginning if it leaves out of account the ideals associated with a League of Nations ih the sense of Lord Phlllimore&apos;s Committee,For the foregoing reasons * apart from pressing the urgent necessity of the case itself, we should, I think, Use all our efforts to promote the formation of a League which would solemnly proclaim.and bind its members under sanction to a policy maintaining peace in the world and securing justice.   The scheme proposed by Lord Phillimore&apos;s Committee is limited In scope and lawyerlike in character and would lend Itself readily to expansion.   It might well be pressed for as the basis for the machinery of the League in the first instance; but I think that the suggestion of Mr. Barnes that the representation of a nation upon the Council of the League should include persons of standing and suitability who are not there either as lawyers or as diplomatists is a good one.   Would it not be possible that the inauguration of such a League might, bo accompanied by a declaration of the rights of nations, which declaration - limited In form and general in character - should not, I think, present great/
great difficulty in drafting? nor ehou-Ji there bo great ., difficulty in securing the concurrence of our chief Allies, Judging from the public statements of their leading representa-tivee.   In one respect, however^ it should, I think, from the outset go further than tho limits of tho terms of reference imposed upon Lord Phillimore&apos;e Committee,   The machinery for the adjudication of disputes therein elaborated Is very important, but the avoidance of disputes by an anticipation of the difficulties which may lead to their arising involves a,greater though less obvious service to the world.   We should therefore contemplate that the Council of the League should be in constant session and should give advice and make suggestions to the members of the League with regard to matters calculated to encourage the arbitrament of the sword.   Much of the stuff which still passes&apos; current as history in our educational systems might well be a subject for review, and the League would doubtless consider whether it should not be an obligation upon its members to prohibit private cltleens from engaging on their own account in the manufacture of armaments.Once established, however, the League will obviously expand in different directions and the economic direction will be one of them.The League will necessarily, in the first instancei as I think, be a League of allied Nations.   As such it would be aware that there are already in existence a number of inter-allied eoonomio organisations which in scope and character seem to approximate to something out of which an Economic League of Nations might be formed.   It has reoently been proposed by Sir Albert Stanley that there should be established an Inter-Imperi&amp;l/
Imperial Central Committee for Haw Materials.   A necessary corollary to this would be an Inter-Allied Raw MaterialsCommittee.   It should not be beyond the wit of man so to shape these and similar international economic organisations into a form in which they could eventually he male part of the machinery of a League of Nations.   In other words, it should not be difficult to graft on to a League of Nations in the sense of Lord PhillimoreTs Committee what might be called an &quot;Economic Branch&quot;,     As the economic association flf the Allies, as projected in the Foreign Office Memorandum (ED.D.C.31), surmounts its j.i-i j j..  jj. o. iffieulties, it would properly become attachod as an economic section to the Council cf the League of Nations, as&quot;an Economic association of the Allies for the Reconstruction of the wo:;ld and the rsFurptlon of civilised life on a basis ofinternational justice and mutual aid&quot;, and having among itsprimary objects &quot;the proper distribution of the economic resources Of the wprld&quot;.1 wish accordingly to make two suggestionsFirst.   (Chat the question of a League of Nations in the sense of Li?rd PhillimoreTs Committee 3hould be considered and pressed forward with $ur Allies at-once, but in isolation from economic questions.Second. That the Economic Defence and Development Committee should&quot;undertake a review of the Inter-Allied economic organisationswhich either exist already or are in contemplation, and that itshould make this review with tho special objeot of seeing hew farsuch organisations&apos; can be adapted for the purposes of a Loaguo gf Nations.o.
