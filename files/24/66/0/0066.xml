Document is the Property7 of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government ]! i    1 &apos; .        Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1918.IN spite of&apos;the greatly increased expenditure of ammunition, I do not propose to ask for any increase in the quantity of coal provided for the Ministry of Munitions in 1919 over that used by us in 1918. I am endeavouring to meet the needs of the army so far as possible from reserves and by imported steel. I have even budgetted for a slight diminution in coal consumption.The Coal Controller has, however, lately given an undue priority to civilian consumption and to non-war industries to the prejudice of the vital military supplies. We are not even receiving the reduced requirement upon which our plans are based. A considerable check to production must be anticipated if this policy is continued, and programmes will be affected accordingly. I consider that further economies in civilian consumption are possible, and that war needs at this juncture should have priority.SECRET.RETURN OF COAL MINERS.w. s. c.October 10, 1918.
