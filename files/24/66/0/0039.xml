 ^ :..:.::rj.v&apos;..&apos;;1.. &apos;s      Property QfHis Britannic IWaJeetVa Cu^-n ,  lU 1351 1 &apos;**&apos;^M*At*^,^^^(j^gjiBOARD OF, AGRICUXaiJRB. .AHD MRgS,Report, for week.ended 8th October,   1919.Land Division.ftnall Holding Colonies,^trln^ton.    The farming operations consisted ef harvesting when weather&quot;permitted, cutting corn with motor tractor, ploughing, etc.    The weather ha3 again been very had this week and for one whole day harvest work was impossible.    A considerable amount of sprouting has taken place, but it is hoped that no serious harm has been done except for seed purposes.    Considerable progrees has been made and if the weather holds good, another week will see the bulk in stack.    There haabeen a certain amount of waste through laid crops, but this is general in the Bast Riding, more especially where there are heavy crops.    The crops produce and stock disposed of during tho week included 182 stone oat3, 1 cwt. bran, 1 owt, Sharps, 1,0?2 eggs, and 8 bullocks which realised  310.17.8,Holbeach.    The horses have been busy completing harvest work, plougHing&quot; rolling field in preparation for turnip seed, and carting potatoes.    The harvest operations are now completed with the exception of some rakings and the stacks are being thatched, , Steam ploughing has been started.Heath Hill.    All the harvest is now in and the crops not stackecPin Dutch barns have been thatched.    A start has been made with potato lifting.    An outbreak of Wart Disease has occurred on tine Colony, the variety of potato being &quot;Arran Chief&quot;.KelhamSstate,    The weather during hay time and harvest was very satisfactory, but since the last loads of corn was carried it has rained intermittently.    All the stacks are now thatched.    The linseed ohly remains uncarted, on account of the delay in ripening, and is still in stook.    The steam tackle has now ploughed 249 acres, and cultivated 56 acres of strong land since harvest.    Of this acreage 52 have been sown with winter oats, 11 with beans, and 10 with wheat.    As much land as possible will be sown with winter corn, reducing the spring corn to a minimum.    There will be approximately 250 acres of wheat, 80 acres of winter oats, 50 acres winter beans, and 6 acres of winter tares,    *f the remainder about 100 acres will be devoted to spring corn, and 150 acres to beet seed, leaving the remainder for fallow crops,    92 qrs, of wheat have been thrashed and sold at 7 5/6d. per $r.    The best fields do not exceed 4 qrs, per acre, which the Manager attributes to the bad farming of the late tenants.    Unless the land received a dressing of lime the results will not be up to expectation, but so far the land is responding satisfactorily to treatment.    The meadow land has been slagged this autumn.    The poverty of the land makes it impossible to oarry the head of live stock that should be expected, but improvements are expected as a result of the manures decided upon,fflax Production Branch,The weather has continually hindered the oarrying of the crop on the few hundred acres still in the field.    Trial runnings of deseeding machinery have not been entirely satisfactory and certain modifications are being made by the Office of ,?/orks. Experiments have been carried out with the new travelling rippling machine built at Selby on the lines of the Summers machines imported from America,    These have yielded very promising results.
An estimate ha8 &quot;beon made tsf- the cost of tho guaranteed price of  14 per aero offered to growers, this estimate being based on 2,000 acres already delivered at Yeovil.    l&apos;he guarantee was found to have come into operation over 105 acres, l.e.        of tho area;   and cost amounted to only  349 in all,     This can be taken as being unexpectedly low.Preliminary estimates have also been mado regarding the cost cf haulage of the crop from farm to depots,    Figures so far available indicate that this has been in the neighbourhood of 21/-per ton.    It has been greatly increased by frequent breakdowns of the mctor lorries,   and a considerable reduction on this figure should be possible.Work on deseeding stations and mills is proceeding somewhat slowly owing to inadequate labour, especially carpenters, and the Office of Works have undertaken to place tho work at Selby^ and at Crowle, where the delay has been marked, in the hands of now contractors.Joint Committee of the Board of Agriculture and fisheriesand Ministry of iToodtJH;ring the past week several new leaflets havo been issued by the Joint Committee, dealing with the 1918 Grain Prices, the procedure as to the UBe and sale cf Hay and Straw, and the position of the farmer and the allotment holder under tho Small and Additional Acreage Sjder.Prim reports reoeived from our Representatives, two questions seem to be uppermost in the farmers1 minds,    firstly, the question of the uss of tail and damaged corn, and secondly, the turning back af moderately fat cattle at market.    Beth these questions are causing high feeling and resentment, the farmer&apos;s ehiaf complaint being, that with tho present scarcity of feeding stuffs, it is impossible for him to obtain feeding stuffs to adequately fatten his stocks, and at the same time every effort is made by the authorities to prevent the use of such home grown feeding stuffs as he has at his disposal for this purpose *    It is felt that until adequate supplies of feeding stuffs are available &quot;for fattening, it is an unwise policy to attempt to restrict the marketing of animals intended for slaughter, and it is feared that unless some concession in this direction is granted, the position will become increasingly difficult.Tithe, Commons.^ Copyhold and. Survey Branch.The applications received during the past week include two for Altered Apportionment, one for redemption, an;&apos;, four for merger of tithe rentcharge, and two for the enfranchisement of copyhold lands, while six Altered Apportionments, two Redemptions, nine Mergers and one 3nfranchisement have been confirmed.    A Considerable number of enquiries as to the basis on which redemption can be effected have been received and dealt with.Publications Branch.The   number of Applications for ordinary i-s-sues of the leaflets was 1698, in response t&apos;i which 3330 copies of leaflets were despatched *     In addition 21250 copies of leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.Applications were received fey 1153 copies of the three Bound Volumes of Leaflets, and 559 copies of the pamphlet &quot;How to manage an Allotment&quot; were sent out.
$ Ordnance Survey.During the week maps were despatched as follows:-War Office 4,702        U.S. Air Force     &apos;      1,000Air Ministry 9,571 Overseas 247,835Admiralty 10,208        Other Services 6181 Draft of Royal Engineers consisting of 17 N.CO&apos;s and men has heen sent to Salonika.DiBeasesi of tAnimals Branch.29 outbreaks of Swine Fever were confirmed during the week out of 217 cases reported.      3 outbreaks of Anthrax were confirmed, , the reported cases of this disease being 29,    There were also 4 outbreaks of Sheep Scab, and 11 of Parasitic Mange.    The marked deorease in the numher of outbreaks of Parasitic Hange in recent weeks is notable.* 1 further outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease was confirmedin Sussex, on a farm adjoining the premises on which the original outbreak occurred.    A third oase was reported, but was not confirmed.17 further reports of cases of Rabies were received from the Devonshire Area, of which 8 were confirmed, making a total of 16 oases confirmed up to the end of the mek?    A new Order was made on the 5th instant, directly requiring the muzzling and also leading of all dogs in the immediate neighbourhood of Plymouth, Fowey, and Modbury, and also prohibiting the movement of dogs out of the Plymouth and Modbury Area except with a licence of the Board requiring quarantine on the premises of a Veterinary Surgeon approved by the Board, for four months*    A number of attempts to evade the requirements of the Board&apos;s Orders restricting the movement of dogs have come to light, and have been dealt with.Fisheri e s Pivision.idmjnjg t ratjbve Sectlon.   A deputationhas been received representing the South Wales and Vest of England Fishing industry in regard to the proposed Order of the Food Controller reducing fish prices.    The deputation urged that measures should be taken to regulate by some means the price of fishing gear so as to maintain this in approximate relation to the price of fish.    The deputation had previously been received by the Ministry of Food, and the latter hay? communicated with the Board as  o their views on the point raised by the deputation.    The matter is under considerationsThe Board have been oonsulted by the Ministry of Shipping as to the Aadvisabllity of allowing the sale of British fishing vessels to foreign owners at the present time, and have expressed the view that sale or transfer to a foreign flag should not &quot;09 allowed^    They do not, however, raise objeotion to the charter of British fishing vessels to foreign owners for periods not exceeding six months.Definite arrangements have now been made for Icelandic I      trawlers to fish out of West coast ports and land their oatchea n      in this countryv    Insurance facilities are being afforded by theY/ar Risks Insurance Office on lines similar to those in operation forBelgian vessels.- Permit S^ctiono    32 Permits to fish have been issued and 53 oancelled. Following on alterations of limits in the line fishing area off the Yorks and Durham Coast, a re-issue of permits is being conducted.
The possibility of an extension of the Thames Estuary fishing areas has been discussed with the Commander-in-Chief, the Nore, and there is a prospect of considerable new areas being opened for fishing. Difficulties in the way of allowing amateur fishing from motor boats in the North &quot;rest District have   not yet been surmounted but negotiations &quot;&apos;ith the naval authorities are proceeding with every prospect of success.Fishermen&apos;s Registration and Recruiting Section.The importance and difficulty of administering the recruiting of P. 124 and F, 126 is almost daily increasing, and becoming mere obvious.    Various suggestions have been made by the Section and from the Coast, and it is hoped shortly to reach a decision as to the line to be adopted in this matter.    Figures shoeing the quantity of fish leaving the Humber ports by rail studied in conjunction with the man-power of the Hull and Grimsby Fleet, show that the mean landing per man of theSe fleets during the year ending in the last week of August last averages 60,7 tons.Fish Pood Committee.The Admiralty have informed the Committee that the fishing gear which will be returned from Russia will be retained by the Admiralty for possible re-shipment to Russia next spring.    The Committee are not, therefore, in a position to negotiate for the sale of any part of this gear, for English fishing.The requirements of the fishermen for the coming sprat fishing have been considered, and a Conference has been held with the Fish Section of the Ministry of Food at which the position was fully discussed.    Arrangements are under consideration.Freshwater Fish Committee.Bel fishing is being carried on, but there have been many difficulties to contend with in the shape of non-delivery of gear, breakages of gear and lack of experience among the fishermen, attributable to the novel character of the methods.The normal work of the Board proceeds on lines indicated in previous reports.11th October, 1918.
