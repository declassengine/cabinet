(1).Sir, .  !; I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 8th October, 1918s-The- Weather and Condition of Crops* There was a slight improvement in the weather last week, and drying winds prevailed in some parts of the country. Farmers who have not already carried the whole of their-corn were enabled to do a certain amount of carting on one or two days, in most districts.The rain has benefited the potato and root crops, but unless a continuous spell of fine weather is experienced shortly the lifting of potatoes will be seriously affected,LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION, Agricultural Executive Committees. Hampshire,   The Committee served an order on the Basingstoke Golf Club to cultivate 60 acres of the course for a crop.-in. 1919&apos;*. but as the tenancy of the Club will terminate at the end of the year the Committee have induced the owner to accept the responsibility of seeing that their cultivation order is carried out, Surrey.   The Board have received a request from the Committee for permission to take possession of a small portion of common land near Guildford, and to let it for the duration of the war to two applicants who are desirous of cultivating it.    The Commons
Preservation Society have been communicated with, and as they ha*oe no objection to the proposal provided the common is reinstate on determination of the occupation, the Committee have been authorised to take possession and to make the suggested arrangemen Prosecutions.   A farmer in Oxfordshire has been fined  15 for failure to comply with an order to cultivate, and three farmers in Carmarthenshire have been fined respectively  40,  25 and  20 for similar offences.Damage by Game.    Action under the Rabbits Order is reported from HerefordshireeHORTICULTURAL DIVISION, Fruit Section.   From inspections made in the fruit growing distric round Penzonce and in the Tajnar Valley certain diseases and pests of fruit trees, namely, Gooseberry Mildew, Silver Leaf and Winter Moth have been found to be very prevalent, and steps are being tak by the Department&apos;s Inspectors to encourage and assist fruit growe with the work of eradicating these pests.Marketing Section.    Arrangements have been made with the Director of the National Kitchens- for putting the Divisional Superintendent of National Kitchens into touch with the County Marketing Societies and Horticultural Sub-Committees with the view of securing supplies Horse Chestnuts.  .   The Department has arranged for the collection of 100 tons of horse chestnuts which are now being used by Messrs,   Bibby and Sons, Ltd., in a test designed to ascertain the economic practicability of using chestnuts in the manufacture of. feeding stuffse    In the event of the test proving successful-., this firm proposes to deal with large quantities of this material
Live Stock Section,    The number of Rabbit Breeding Centres which have now been established is 156.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Inspection of Land.   Several farms taken over by Agricultural Executive Committees have been inspected.    The following are instances(1) Dairy House Farm, Massey, Cheshire. This farm was taken over by the War Office two years ago, and for one year was let to a tenant who allowed it to become practically derelict.    This year the War Office entered into an arrangement with the Executive Committee whereby the latter undertook the cultivation of the land, the War Office bearing all expenses.    One of the conditions laid  own by the War Office is that no grain erops shall be grown, and ,the area dealt with this year, therefore, includes 70 acres.potatoes, 5 acres table turnips and 15 acres fallow.    The cultivation of the land previous to planting was all done by tractor, and both that and the subsequent cultivations have been very well carried out.    The land was so foul that planting was very late, but notwithstanding this a very useful crop of potatoes has been secured.(2) Halton Park, Cheshire.   Ninety acres of this park were taken over, broken up, disc-narrowed 8 times, and planted with potatoes.    A very good crop has been secured, and the area presents a fine sight,-particularly when compared with the rough, practically derelict, park land adjoining.Plant Diseases.    A visit was paid to the district where parsnip ,canker had caused such serious losses during the past two years. This season very few reports as to damage through canker had been received, and it was ascertained that the growth cracks, which in that district are largely responsible for initiating canker, were much less prevalent than usual,    This may be attributed partly to better methods of cultivation, and partly to the nature of the season.
Seed Testing Station, 1,812&quot; samples were received during I September, making a total of 2,722 samples sinoe the season begi on August 1st. The majority are cereal and vegetable samples, the large increase this season being mainly due to these seeds having been brought under the provisions of the Testing of Seed; Order. Most of the reports have been sent out within 6 * 14 di of the receipt of the samples.&amp;AB0UR DIVISION. Harvest Labour.   The number of soldiers specially released for harvest work and still out on farms is 5,631.4Ploughmen for Autumn Cultivation.- The military authorities havi informed the Department that every endeavour will be made to fi skilled ploughmen to assist with the autumn work. It is not ,possible under existing conditions to ask for Category V men to be sent home from France, but enquiries are being made as to the numbers of ploughmen serving at home who oan be made availal to.be sent out on two months&apos; agricultural furlough.Further, it. has been arranged that soldier ploughmen belonging to Agricultural Companies who have been recently gradi &quot;A&quot; are not...to be withdrawn for the present, even though substii have already been provided by-the military authorities.ftprisoners of gar.    The soheme for the provision of migratory g of prisoners of war for threshing and, other agricultural work during the winter, has not yet bean approved by the military authorities, but in the meantime the War Office have agreed thai pending further instructions, the migratory gangs composed of prisoners of war at present out from Agricultural Working OampBj can,remain out, if required.Representations have been made to the Ministry of National Service that the migratory gangs composed of prisoner!^ loaned frew other Government Departments for the com harvest, should be allowed to remain at least until the end of the potatj
harvest, but the Ministry have been unable to allow this, as the services of the prisoners are required back urgently at their former work.Women1s Branch.Supply of hahour - The demand for women for threshing and for the potato harvest is still greater than the supply.   A large number could be supplied for the potato harvest in Lincolnshire, however.!, if the difficulties of billeting could be overcome.    As the local women are themselves, to work, it is difficult for- them to billet members of the Land Army and most of the barns and buildings in&apos; this very scattered area are unsuitable for camps at this time of year.The Welfare Officers continue to do useful work, especially in connection with the camps which have been set up for the potato harvest in various&apos; parts of the country where the conditions of billeting are rough, the farms are lonely, and the work monotonous. Women&apos;s Institutes - Eight new Institutes have been started since last week.CULTIVATION DIVISION. Tractor Scheme - The following statement shows the position with regard to the provision of tractors, machinery and implements for the week ended 5th October, 1918:-No. consigned      Total No, with during week.        Counties.Tractors .......... 89 4,225. Ploughs............ 94 5,256(3 withdrawn)Up to the 5th October 2,503 Pordson Tractors, released to Messrs. Henry Ford and Son for sale to farmers had been dispatched.     Only tmo more remain to be dispatched to complete the number released for this purpose.During the week ended 20th September 15,835 acres were ploughed, 274 acres were cross ploughed and 2,228 acres were cultivated
Spare.....Part s -   Since the beginning of the year the Department habeen endeavouring to place upon a regular basis the manufacture certain parts required for Titan Tractors.    The Base Depot have from time to time found it necessary to get spare parts manufact in the absence of supplies from America and it was considered thf in cases in which the price was not appreciably greater than the cost of imported spare parts it was desirable on the so*re of economy and security to manufacture in this country rather than import.   The preliminary negotiations have been very protracted, but satisfactory arrangements have now been made with the Agricultural Machinery Department of the Ministry of Munitions. It. is proposed in the same way to manufacture in this country spare parts required for^other tractors and for tractor ploughs, Steam Tackle -   The acreage dealt with during the past week is as follows;- ploughed 14,979 acres, cultivated 13,574 acres, harrowed 360 acres, mole drained 147 acres, rolled 268 acres. Total 29,328 acres.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Superphosphate - Circulars are being sent to Agricultural Executive Committees, Horticultural Sub-Committees and Allotmen Associations, emphasising the importance of orders for super-phosphate being placed for early delivery, in order to avoid railway congestion in the coming spring, and to ensure a maximui output at superphosphate works.   Circulars on the subject hRve already been sent to fertiliser merchants and compound fertilis manufacturers.Basic Slag.   Licences for the delivery of basic slag have been issued in respect of the whole production of England and Wales, excepting about 23,000 tons which are held in reserve to meet &amp; special requirements.
Itfart Disease.   Over 2,000 new outbreaks of Y/art disease have been reported or discovered sinoe the 1st Junei    Inspectors report that many cases have been notified by the occupiers of infected premises as a result of the display of the illustrated poster distributed throughout the country.,The returns of crops of immune varieties of potatoes inspected to date show that 2,356 acres have been examined by the Departments Inspectors, of which 2,209 acres have been certified as true to type and reasonably free from &quot;rogues1, Spraying.    Between January and July 1918 1,370 lectures and 947 demonstrations were given by the Department1 s staff.In trials carried out at Christchurch with Scotch &quot;tfp-to-Date&quot; fseed!, which was planted in rows 2&amp; foet apart and 16 inches between the sets, the produce of 1 rod unsprayed gave a total weight of 287 lbs,* of which 226 lbs. were healthy tubers and 61 lbs. were affected with blight.    The produce of 1 rod sprayed three times gave a total weight of 401 lbs., of which 345 lbs. consisted of healthy tubers and 56 lbs. of tubers affected with blight.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, Director General.The Rt.
