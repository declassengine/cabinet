(this document is the prooertv o1IffiDBAiDini fi)R WAR CAB I NET ; RAW IMPERIALS *I.    Very soon after the appointment of the Trade   . Relations Committee it became clear, that the question of Raw Materials would form an important part of its work.    I accordingly arranged that the Committee should investigate closely the requiremezits of the British Empire, in respect of certain specified raw materials with a view to determining how far(a) we had enough and to spare in respect of certain essential -materials,(b) we had a deficiency in certain other essential materials which we could only supply from the resources o-l.other Allied countries. &apos;The idea which I had in mind was that we should endeavour first to settle an Imperial-policy in respect .a.t..&apos;raw^aieri.als; so that we should be in a strong &quot;position in respect of subsequent negotiations with the Allies.       It seemeci clear that only one or more Imperial Conferences could settle-an Imperial policy and it was obviously essential that so far as His Majesty1s Government was.concerned, adequate preparations should have been made beforehand. .The preliminary investigations of the Trade Relations Committee were embodied in two Reports, both of which were submitted to the War Cabinet (Minute 387 No .9 cf April 9th) and communicated to the self-governing Dominions.   A third Report was also prepared dealing more in detail with individual raw materials which with the first two. was submitted to the Imperial War Conference, 1918*    In connection with the Reports in question certain draft Resolutions were drawn up to.      . form\
form a basis for discussion at the Conference (see War Cabinet Minute 431 No.ll of 17th June).II.    The Imperial War Conference devoted a great deal of attention to the subject and the draft Resolu-tions were discussed in considerable detail.  Ultimately they were Modified to a Considerable extent and the Resolutions ultimately passed by the Conference were to the following effect:-(a) That it was necessary to secure for the British Empire and the belligerent Allies the command of cer-tain essential raw materials in order to enable them to repair the effects of the war as soon as possible, and to safeguard their industrial requirements.(b) That the Governments of the British Empire should make such arrangements amongst themselves as would ensure that essential raw materials produced with-in the Empire should be available for the above purposes, and should arrange with the Allied Countries to utilise for the sane purposes essential raw materials produced in those countries.(c) That amongst the raw materials which should be considered for the purpose of this policy should be the following:-Asbestos      . Lead, and its oresCotton ManganeseJute Nickel, refined and matteWoo 1 Spelter and zinc concentratesHides, skins and     Tin and its oresLeather Tungsten oresRubber HicaOleaginous products Molybdenitepetroleum Coal, with special referenceto steam coal Copper Aluminium ores.(d) That the Governments represented at the Conference should consult with the representatives of the producers and trades concerned as to the method of obtaining connand best suited to each individual commodity.(e) That steps should be taken to ascertain the needsand
and the resources of the Allies in respect of the raw materials enumerated above.It was clear from the discussions that the Ministers aid. other representatives present did not feel themselves sufficiently acquainted with the de-tails of the subject to commit their Governments to a greater extent than is apparent from the Resolutions stated a,bove.    A Committee of the Conference was,&apos; however, appointed, to gjo into the question in as much detail,as time permitted, and this Committee prepared a Report setting out in brief the problems arising in respect of each of the raw materials specified.  This Report was approved by the Conference and has now been communicated to the Governments of the Dominions and India in order that, their views may be ascertained as to the consequential action necessary.    Some time, however, ,-must necessarily elapse before it is possible to receive replies.III.    Meanwhile, the need for action is becoming urgent, for while time is running on we may find peace negotiations upon us before anything is settled.    It is true that a number of Committees have been at work on various aspects of the problem.    These Committees have conducted much useful enquiry and he.ve collected a. large quantity of valuable information of different kinds, but the only positive action taken so far has been that which particular Departments have taken in respect to individual commodities e,g. jute or wool, vfhat appears to be now required is machinery which will ensure that action of this kind is carried fur-ther.    The machinery must be such as will not only provide for our.own needs but will be capable of adaptation and expansion as soon as arrangements withour
our Allies are sufficiently advanced.hy own view is that the best procedure will be to deal one by one with the raw materials referred to in the Resolutions of the Imperial fsr Conference, and in my opinion the simplest arrangement will be that indicated in the&apos; second Report on Raw Materials of the Trade Relations Committee.     Accordingly, after consultation with the minister of Reconstruction I propose -&quot;That the following Ministers, viz. the secretary of State for the Colonies, the Secretary of State for India, the Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign Affaire, the president of the Board of Trade, the rinicter of Reconstruction, The Chairman ot the proposed Standing Council on Priorities, and the Financial Secretary ot the Treasury should be em-powered to consider with the Departments directly concerned with the supply during the war of each of the raw materials referred to in the Resolutions of the Imperial T;ar Conference, what action is necessary to provide that the necessary supplies shell, in fact, be available for the United Kingdom alter the war, and arrange with those Departments for such adoinistra-tive action, beyond what has already taken place, as is necessary to secure such supplies1-.I would further suggest that these Ministers should be later on responsible for the appointment and instruction of the United Kingdom representatives on any Inter-Allied Conference appointed to consider the post-v/ar allocation of raw materials.-COLONIAL OFFICE. \7,H.L.b.lo .18.
