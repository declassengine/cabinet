But steps have now boen taken to:deal with this area and we hope before 1      long that those engaged in the staple industries of the Country will find that the restrictions imposed, render it essential for. them to place themselves on the side of law and order and assist the administration in combatting a condition of affairs which re-fleets detrimentally through the whole economic life of the Country.(Signed).

II. piCopy of letter from the General Officer Commending-in-Chlef^the JForoes in Ireland, to Lord French.7th October, 1918.Your Excellency,I have the honour to submit the following Heport on tho general condition in Ireland for the month of September in eo far as it affects the Military situation.fifATB OF ggg COUNTRY.An openly hostile attitude towards the troops Is seldom encountered, but trials of prisoners who neve been arrested under the D.O.R.A. or occasions when they ore being moved under escort, are often seized upon to make hostile demonstrations against either the Military or Police, including occasional stone throwing end sometimes actual collision with crowds.    This, however, has never been on a big scale and it, has not proved necessary to resort to anything more active than a police baton charge to deal with it.A oaee of tampering with the loyalty of troops was brought to notice at Limerick with the result that 6 -tradesmen were plaoed out of bounds.    This action, I think, proved beneficial as no further oases of a similar nature have come to notice.RAIDS FOR ARMS.    &apos;The raiding of private houses for arms has certainly diminished but a certain number, of attacks upon small groups of soldiers or   -police or single men have taken place, their arms being successfully captured.    I am taking very active measures to prevent a recurrence of these unfortunate episodes end the orders that I have Issued on the subject will, I hope, prove effective in putting a stop   to them in futuro. .ILLEGAL DRILLING.Open illegal drilling has become practically extinct but opportunity is still being taken by Sinn Feiners to attend funerals in*Military formation and even occasionally to wear uniforms at them.    This infringement of the orders on the subject is, however, so childish that I have thought it well not to take any action in the matter.GENERAL REMABiCS.The violent death.of J. Better at Enniscorthy strengthens the belief that local manufacture of bombs is still taking place to a certain extent.    According to my information, txhere is no doubt that the injuries which caused the death of this man were due to an explosion of some kind.    I also understand that other persons who were with him sustained injuries which they have so far been ablo to conceal.lio trace has yet been found of the gelignite whioh was stolen from Amiens Street Railway Stationn-Rebel correspondence shows mo that, the Sinn Fein leeders are constantly impressing on their followers that they must bepreparedThe Lord Lieutenant, Ireland.
r? -prepared for a conflict,     The main object for this is, in my opinion, to hold their members oloeely together and to keep them under proper control,     The Sinn Pein circular to all centres calling for a reply to the following question indicates the anxiety of their leaders to keep their people up to the mark;-&quot;Does each member intend to stand to the pledge of last&quot;May, namely, to stand in tho breach and fight the two&quot;dangers, Conscription and the reduction of the produce &quot;of the Coventry&quot;.SPECIAL MILITARY AREAS.The County of Clare still remains a special Military Area but all restrictions in connection with it have now been removed - the last one which-enforced special restrictions upon the District of Tcmgraney has only just been removed.The West Riding of Cork has been declared a Special Military Area and special measures restricting ingress arc already in force.     It will probably be also necessary to make restrictions with regard to public houses, fairs and meetings in certain parts of this Area.COAST WATCHING,As-Your Excellency is aware I reisod the question of the unsatisfactory system of Coast Watching in Ireland with the Army Council.     As a result of my action the matter was taken up with the Admiralty who made a proposal that the whole of the Coast Watching be taken over by the Army.     This proposal was submitted to me for my remarks and I have definitely opposed it, I consider that without question it is a level matter and the only satisfactory way to carry out the work is to enlist a special Naval Force from retired and partially disabled soldiers and sailors to replace tho existing civilian watchers.The matter is still receiving tho tonsIderation of the Army Council.MILITARY INTELLIGENCE,,The amplified system of Military Intelligence which I have introduced in Ireland whereby all units have their own small systems of Military Intelligence is, I think, beginning to bear fruit.     The Officers carrying out this work are taking a keen and intelligent interest in it and I hope that it will prove of considerable value in future.INSPECTIONS.Luring the past month I have visited and inspected the  . bulk of the Military stations in Ireland. .  Considering that the great majority of the troops are either training as reinforco-ments, or are men of low category, I was on the whole satisfied.STRENGTH 0? FORCESDaring the month there has been a total decrease of 9,000 men in Ireland but the great majority of these are men who wer o being trained as dra fts.I have the honour to be, etc.(signed)   E.

REPORT BY INSPiiQTOR-QilNERiLL, BOYaL IRISH CONSTABULARY, FOR MOUTH OP AUGUST, 1910.,----oOo----UNDER SECRETARY.I have to report that during the Month of August there was little if any change in the political discontent and unrest described in my previous Monthly reports on tho condition of the Provinces;   material prosperity was well maintained, and the country was outwardly quiet.With the exooption of a Oe-Operative Company formed for the osrfeablishwont of a oorn and flour mill at Enniskillen which is making good progress, and a proposal to develop the production of lignite along the shores of Lough Neagh in Antrim, there were no new cases of industrial development reported.     Exist-ing industries, however, throughout Ireland were actively employed,Farmers continued to derive a substantial pro-fit from agricultural operations, while their labour-ers owing to the enormous rise in the cost of pro-visions found it hard to live, and demanded a consid-erable increase of wages.     The farmers have tooen obliged to yield tQ these demands and arc forming a federation for tho protection of .their interests, and it is expectod that after tho harvest they will discharge a number of their men.The Irish Transport and General Workers Union established several new Branches;   it is extending rapidly, and absorbing the local trade and labour unions.Strikes, which are becoming more frequent, were ^ reported at a handkerchief factory in Belfast, at the &apos; Warronpoint Ship Yard, and the Docks at !Derry and Cork.Efforts by the Lord Mayor, Shipping Cos. and the Harbour Board to settle the dockers strike at Cork having failed, the ships sent to that port to replace the loss caused by submarines have boen withdrawn, some vessels bound for   Cork with wheat and&quot;other   ... cargoes have boen diverted to other Ports, and work at the Quays is at a standstill.The Secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union at Belfast received an order from DublinHead Quarters to withdraw Union men from the Belfast Docks in sympathy with the Cork dockers, but promp&amp;Tjy refused compliance.In a very large area of tho Provinces the owner-ship of farms has passed from the landlords to the occupiers under r,ho hand Purchase Acts;   but owing to r-h&quot;s financial strain of the War further purchase issuspendodoAgrarian agitation, bowover,, still continues, and prevailed during the Month in the Counties of GaiwayantIll
and Clare, -and to -a lessor extent in part a of Dublin, Kilduro, Lilkonny, ILing&apos;s Co. and Mouth.In Galwoy and Clare whore intimidation io alwaysrife, 150 persons Jiavo to be afforded protection by tho Police, ana on u few   Estates in Kilkenny and Mayo thetenants are withholding payment of rent with a vie., to forcing a sale.But as a general rule rents aro well paid and the relations between landlord and tenant are fairly amicable.Tho firm attitude of Government in dealing with disaffection, and tho increased support afforded to the Polioo has had tho effect of lessoning the open hoa-tility displayed towards that body;   but the bitter fooling against the Police aroused by their activity in suppressing the rebel movement still exists, and efforts wore made in the Counties of Galvray, Cork und Limerick to boycott them.The Order declaring Traloc a Special Military area, after an attempt to murder two members of the ft. I. 0. in-broad daylight in that town, was withdrawn on August 25rd; but the inconvenience suffered by the townspeople while it was in force is believed to have taught them a salutary lesson,The voluntary recruiting campaign is now in op-oration, the homan Catholic Clergy and the farming class are, however, adverse to military service, and the re-sults so far aro very poor.     It is believed that the majority of the recruits are for the Loyal Air Ir&apos;oroo*It will be soon&apos;  from tho attached Table of In-dictablis Offences that tho criminal calendar w^s as usual comparatively light.     Tho following oases may be specially mentioned :-DOMLGiiLv     On August 15th., a desert or v/as arrested and taken to the Police   Barracks at Iliddlotown. A mob attacked the Barracks that night with stones, breaking some windows, and fired a few shots.     The Police wore not in sufficient force to go out, and fired one or two revolver shots from, an upper window. No oho was injured and the deserter Was safely escorted to Military Custody next day.LTLDA3E.     At ICilcock on August 17th., after tho arrest oi a man for reading a seditious Sinn Pein . document at a public mooting, a threatening-crowd assembled and remained outside the Police Barracks all night, and when the prisoner had boun taken into Military custody next morning drilled in the town. Three of tho ringleaders have been arrested for trial under the Criminal Law and Procedure Acto
9 0Ol&apos;jAt.about 4 u.m. on 24th august a woman approached tho military sentry on duty at Maryboro&apos; Station and questionod him ubout tho train service.    While they woro conversing two men oame up.    ffha sonfcry wan covered with revolvers, disarmed, gagged and bound with ropes and loft in&apos; tho waiting room.&apos;    this outrage was no doubt the work of Sinn Peinors.&apos;On August 29th. Penis Doyle was fired at on the road at Castlotown but not sorioms-ly injured.   Motive - agrarian.In connexion with agrarian disputes there wore several cases of malicious injury to property.On 31st July two brothers named Fitzgerald wore fired at while mowing at Bullinuourra and were subsequently ordered out of the meadow by a man armed with a gun. Motive - agrarian.On 3 Oth July shots were fired from a plantation at Hlnoon to intimidate men making hay on boycotted land adjoining..On 1st August P.Fitzgerald and Thomas Shannon were fired at and wounded at Doolin while drawing turf to the Police Barrack.Two men arrested but discharged for want of evidence.On the night of 7th August, atCloonoyogan two men armed and disguised entored the house of Matthew Frawley,which they ransacked, and took away  30 In notes and silver.    They searched for money, not for arms.At 1 a.m. at Eyries, on 26th August, two police stopped a couple of men on the road to interrogate thorn.    The latter bolted but uoturned with others and attacked tho police, whom they kicked and stoned and tried to disarm.    The Police wore ob-ligud to fire in order to disperse them. Four men have boon identified and will bo tried by Court Martial.On tho night of 10th August six men fired shots, and exploded small bombs outside the house of a farmer at Inchigeola with the object of intimi-dating him and compelling him to oeaso supplying the local police tilth turf.(TABLE)

They showed considerable reluctance to ask for permits as required by the recent Order under D.R. Regulation 9 AA, but they eventually did so, except at Omagh where Mr. Dillon vas announced to speak.     Mr&apos;. Devlin was the principal sxxjakor at a largo gathering at Monaghan.   The promoters of Mr&apos;. Dillon&apos;s meeting at Omagh wero informed both before and.after the arrival of that gentleman, that a permit was necessary and would be- issued on application, but they would not apply, and therefore the meeting was prohibited.Agents- of the United Irish Loaguo attended/T A B L E.
9 c) 9 t* &amp;the Revision Sessions to look after the ^^^S^ in preparation for the Creneral Election, hut otherwise this Society was inactive.No attempt was made to revive the NationalVolunteersThe Sinn Fein movement, if not losing ground -and there Is not sufficient evidence to assert that it is - is certainly not outwardly making progress. This is no doubt, largely the result of the fim attitude Of Government,&apos;the internment Of the most prominent   , and mischievous leaders and organizers, a stricter oonsbrshio of the Press which prevents the publication p)f disloval articles, tho enthusiasm of the Americana in the War, the recent success of the Allied Armies, and the extravagance of Sinn Fein policy?The number of Sinn Fein Clubs in the Provinces of which the Police have knowledge is still 1,334 with a membership of about 110,000, only seven new Clubs having been formed during the Month of August.Members have been c^-opted to fill the vacancies in the Central Council of Sinn Pein created by the deportations in May.A Meeting of this Council,, attended/by about 60 delegates from the Executives throughout the Provinces, took place at the Mansion House, 3Sublin, on August 20th. Father 0&apos;Flanagan, Vice-president, and Acting President in the absence of De Valera who is is interned, presided. He is the only member of the original, governing body of seven now at large, and has recently beon inhibited by his Bishop for breaches of ecclesiastical discipline and deprived of his Curacy in County Rosoommon.Resolutions were passed in reference to the threat . Tif conscription^, &quot;land confiscation&quot; for soldiers, and the womiwg General Election, and a report was presented by by Ir, Kathleen Lynn, Director tf Public Health under the Sinn Fein Executive, in which she stated that she had been obliged to set aside the ordinary work of her department jn order to deal with the alarming state of affairs caused py Infection from babies sent from England to be boarded in Ireland.mtin      0n A7sust .3rd, a.printed address signed by Pat her 0&apos;Flanagan, Acting President of Sinn Fein, and two Hon. bseretaries, reciting the Republican, aims&apos;fit the movement and instances of.alleged brutal treatment of Irish Political prisoners, etc, Was sent by the Secretary at Sinn Fein Head-Quarters, Lublin   to. all Sinn Fein Clubs, with directions to have it read publicly on August lfth.A number of surprise meetings were seoretly arranged all over the country,   and it, was hoped a$&apos;doubt that by this open defiance of the D.R.Regulations the damaged prestige of Sinn Fein would be repaired.    &apos;: The plan,   however,   did.nfffsucceed as expected.     &apos; The Circular fell into the-lands of the R, I, f*.thrrer1!i?^wf\vlDefore the   aPPoi&quot;^d date with tne result that they--were everywhere on the alert.Arrangements
Arrangements were made to prevent any meetings on a largo scale, and between 30 and 40 persons have been arrested and are awaiting trial by Court Martial for reading the document at small gatherings.     This document was also read by a few priests.Some isolated instances of Illegal Drilling in remote places wore reported; but an effective system of Police and Military patrolling is in operation in the more disaffected areas, and there was no indication, of any serious attempt to revive this practice.Tho proclamation of Sinn Fein as a dangerous association has had a reassuring effect .on all moderate people and Sinn Feiners, owing to the measures adopted for the suppression of open lawlessness, have to take it lying down.The Police in various raids have, however, seized large quantities of seditious literature, which is evidence that the revolutionists are secretly pushing their organisation.   Efforts are still being made to corrupt the loyalty of the Police force, and circulars with this object entitled lrAn open letter to an Irish, Policeman&quot; were received by post at a number of Barracks; copies were also found placarded in public places and torn down.Although as already mentioned tho demeanour of Sinn Feiners towards the Police has become less openly aggressive, in some lawless localities members of the Force were wantonly attacked and compelled to use their arms in self defence.Efforts were made by a disorderly crowd at.Hewry to break up Colonel Lynchrs recruiting meeting on 3.0th August-i   The disturbers were driven down a side street by the Police, and the meeting was regarded as fairly successful - a few recruits being obtained,   No anti-recruiting meetings have been attempted, but the tone of tho Sinn Fein Press is openly hostile: tho Clergy, too, are unfavourable to Military Sorvioe, and some of the young ,:inn Fein priests have spoken strongly against it.     One of these Clergymen at his Church in Mayo on August 11th told the congregation to bo prepared for conscription which was merely postponed until after the harvest. He referred to the voluntary recruiting scheme as bound to fail and said &quot;I hope you will all keep to your pledge.     Let no man join the Army.     Bettor all die than one man ,join the British Army.   Any-one who takes part in this recruiting scheme.has no self-respect. I hope no one in this parish will have.anything to do with it. The few who give information to the Police can join, they would be no loss to the parish&quot;,. Broad of conscription which has always been a strong factor in&quot; the life of the Sinn Fein movement, but which had declined of late, is likely to again become- acute as the time allotted for voluntary recruiting slips by.   The determination to resist has shown no sign of abatement, the organisation is believed to be in readiness and has probably been strengthened, as the Irish Transport and General Workers Union which is largely ;winn Fein, has made rapid progress and appears to be vigorously opposed to conscription.At present the energies of Sinn Fein are concentrated on preparations for the General Election.     Like their opponents, the Parliamentary warty, they arc represented at the Revision Sessions, County Executives are selecting prospective candidates for the Constituencies, and they confidently expect to win by a sweeping majority.Various
10 - Part III,    9 ? K............. V 1^ t?m Various rumours of landing and expected landings ofarms were current, &quot;but they have not been substantiated. The Police have no reason to suopeot that any landings took plaoe and this is corroborated by a reliable and wel-UJLntfoircaed, informant who states that the Sinn Fein party are badly off for rifles and have no prospect of getting any except the ftfw that may be got from soldiers, but that verbal communioa-tions are often sent from Head Quarters to country unite for the purpose Of sustaining their spirits.As will be inferred the prospect of armed inaurreo-tion is remote so long as necessary firmness backed by adequate-military .force is maintained.&apos;(Signed)   0*. BYRNE,INSPECTOR GENERAL,llth September. 1918.IV.REPORT By I^CTO^flENERAT, ROYAL TRTflH, , CONSTABULAi\Y,-: FOR MONTH OF SEPTEMBER. 191.0.PART I.    tlHlM SECRETARY,GENERAL I have to report that little if any change tookCONDITION place in the condition of the Provinces during the Month if OF THE     September.    The same wide-spread political unrest prevailed, COUNTRY,   though held in oheok by firm administration;   outwardly, immmrmmmmmmmmm   however, things were quiet, and the various industries throughout the country continued to prosper.All tho large works in North-East Ulster ware busy with the exception of those engaged in linen manufacture Which owing to scarcity of raw material could snly work short time.    Apparently the Irish flax crop is barely sufficient to supply the factories far three months working full time. They are consequently chiefly dependent on impertsfrom abroad, and it is said that 5&quot;0,000 tons are awaiting shipment at Vladivostock.    Efforts were made last year to increase home cultivation, and good reports en the flax crops are received from Southern &amp;nd Western Counties where the experiment Las been tried-.Progress was made with the construction of railway eommunioatlon for the -development of the Coal Mines at Arigna on the borders of Sligo and Roscommon, and at Castlecomer and Wolfhill in the Kilkenny arid Carlow districts, and the coal though not very suitable-for domestic purposes is at present in&apos; great demand.The coal shortage has given rise to a lucrative trade in Turf.    This fuel which hitherto was not much used in the larger tuwns and oould be purchased at about 15/* per t$n is now fetohing  2.Farmers oontinued to reap substantial profits from the inflated price of agricultural produco, and the harvest is expected to be abundant, notwithstanding that in some  laces corn and potatoes have been damaged by the recent heavy rains.No new industries have been reported &quot;but arrangements are in train for, the establishment of a tannery&apos;at Drogheda in County Louth.       - -The Irish
The Irish Transport and General Workers Union was very active during the Month, and is now spreading rapidly in the Provinces,     It appears to he haud-in-hand with Sinn Fein in opposition to Consoripoion,    WwC, Ooates, one of it&apos;s organisers declared at a labour raoeuing in Co, Kilkenny that they would not have Oonsoription &quot;with or without Home Rule&quot;, and Cathal Shannon, a prominent official of the Union, and Editor of &quot;The Voice of Labour&quot;, referring to the matter at a mooting at Armagh, said that 250,000 members of the Transport Union would resist it; but in this extravagant statement the speaker was probably estimating the dimensions which he expects the Society will attain, rather than its existing member ship.    Up to the present 160 Branches of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, comprising about 26,000 members, have come under notice of the R.I.C. in tho Provinces,The dockers strike at Cork mentioned in my last report has been settled.Some new strikes at industrial works in the North and one at the Arigna Colliery occurred during September, but the number of hands affected was not large, and they agreed to submit their claims to arbitration and resume work,,Roports were also received from several Countios on a small scale, chiefly among agricultural labourers, which in nearly every ease were successful in obtaining higher wages.     The strike of Dispensary doctors in the Poor Law Union of Omagh is still unsettled, and the Rational Schosl teachers have given notice of their intention to cease work from November 4th, unless their claims are acceded to.The relations between landlord and tenant were not unfriendly, and the farmers experience no difficulty in paying their rents.On a few estates payment is still withheld with a view to compelling the landlords to sell, to the Congested Districts Board, but generally agrarian agitation was not acute, except in the Counties of Galway and Clare where owing to the prevalence oft intimidation special police arrangements were still necessary for the protection of 142 persons.     In tho Ballinasloe Dietriot of Galway workmen employed&apos;by the Congested Districts Board building houses for congests have to.be proteoted, in consequence of tho violent opposition of the local people to the scheme of allotment adopted by the Board.   Some local agrarian unrest was also reported In parts of Xing*s Co. QueenTs Co., Mayo and Meath.As shown by the accompanying Table of Indiotable Offences the country was comparatively free from ordinary crime and it will suffice to invite attention to the following casesMATH.   On the night of September 26th the house of James Smith at Tullyallen was fired into.   No person was injured. Motive believed to be agrarian.0ORK.E.R, On the night of August 29th a rick of hay belonging toThomas Kelloher was maliciously set on fire at Killeagh. The only motive assigned is that Kelleher refused to join Sinn Fein.  50 compensation claimed.On Sept,8th at 6,30 a.m.. at Queenstown 3 soldiers return-ing off duty were attacked by 12 men armed^and masked, who after robbing them of their arms and equipment, bound them with ropes and mado off - the soldiers appeared to havo no ammunition.   The rifles and&apos; 1 bayonet were subsequently found hidden in a vault in the Cemetery.On the night of Septomber 11th a rifle was stolen by civilians from a soldier in the street near Cork Military Barrack,
A few isolated raids for arms occurred in Cork, Limerick and Perm.ar.agh, but the firmer administration of the law, to-gether with the assistance afforded to the Police by the Military detachments in patrolling disturbed areas, has prac-tically suppressed this form of outrage,The G,0 ,C,-in-Chief on September 30th, made an Order do-claring Cork - West Riding,, a..Special Military Area.He has now issued u further Order prohibiting the keeping of arms, unless with permit, in any part of Ireland,This Order, which takes effect from October 9th., will strengthen existing arrangements for the protection of life and property and the suppression of acts of lawlessness by armed persons,Aggressive hostility to the R.I.C. because of their loyal ty and fidelity in spite of efforts by Clerics and others to corrupt them, has become less noticeable except in parts of Cpmiaught and Minister,     In these disaffected localities it is still unabated as evidenced by the attacks on patrols above mentioned; to which instances tho following may be added:-The parties stationed at Ballygar and Castleblakency in Galway and at Eyries in West Cork are partially boycotted as to provisions.     At Labasheeda in Clare, being unable to pro-cure fuel they were compelled to comandeer a cart load of turf from a man who was fafraid to sell it.    /In connexion with this a Constable was fined for a technical assault.At Newport, Tipperary, the police could not get any carrier to draw their cool supply from the railway station, and the County Inspector is obliged to requisition military transport.With the exception of a fanatical section of Sinn Peiner? who aro intensely anti-British, the mass of tho people appear to regard, tho War with, apathy, and they have turned a deaf ear. to tho Lord Lieutenant&apos;s appeal for 50,000 recruits. At the end of September less than 8,000 had responded.CORK W.R.LIMERICK.- IS * Part IV.On the night of September 23rd near Bantry 2 police on patrol were knocked off their cycles by a&quot; party of men who beat them savagely while on the ground, and robbed them of their arms and ammunition.On September 18th at&apos; Eyorios 2 soldiers escorting a ration cart wore attacked.     Only one soldier was armed and his rifle was taken from him.On the night cf September 6th near Abbeyfeale several shots were fired at a Police patrol by Thomas Leahy, a local Irish Volunteer, who having wounded one Constable, escaped, and has not yet been arrested.On Sept. 26th near Ennistymon 3 ricks of turf which had been sold to the military were malioious-ly seb on fire - compensation has been claimed.

r 14 -FART tv.But embarrass;d by the interment of its principal leaders, and d pr.-,g3,d by th-. repeated victories of the Allied Armies whioh render more and moiv improbable th. realization of its rcpubli-oan ambitions through German influence, the Sinn Fein movement made no visible progress and the number bf Clubs remained stationery during the Lonth.Firm administration has already done much to restore the authority of the law.     Drilling lies practically ceased.The customary village Aerideachts and sports for which permits are not required were held at various places, and, as a rule, they wtiw conducted in an orderly manner, end without th-  seditious cri.es, parades in military formation, etc. which until lately characterised the bc gatherings.Some exceptions, however, occurred, and in such cases the prominent offenders weiw generally prosecuted for unlawful assembly.      Advertised meetings of a political nature for which no permits had been sought were prohibited at jfillstreet in Co. Cork, and at Clady in Tyrone.At Enniscorthy, Co. Wcxford, a local le.ader of Irish Volunteers who died from injuries believed to have been sustained while experimenting with explosives, was buried with se-mi-rnilitary honours.    Throi thousand persons,  including a large number of Irish Volunteers, marched in the procession.   Twenty-one of the Volunteers wore uniform and the question of pro sc.-cution has been submitted for consideration.Several Sinn Feiners were convicted by Courts Martial, and sent to prison -with hard labour for one ywar, for the offence: of reading at public meetings en 15th August c seditious address referred to in my 1 ast report.Th-... prospect of Conscription as the result of failure- to provide the voluntary recruits called for by the- Lord Lieutenant is causing considerable uneasiness.By the majority of th. p-. eple it is regarded as inevitable, but a substantial numlw r/believe that it will not be enforced.It will be remembered that on the application of the Military Service- Act to Ireland a few- months ago the Reman Catholic Clergy,  in alliance with the- leaders of the Nation-alist and Sinn Fein parties,  gave their sanction to a pledge to resist the. measure.   This pledge was administered outside the Churches, wh era. also collections eeiw. mode for a National Defence Fund, WKch has since amounted to  250,000.    Then, however, the tide of War was not running in favour of the: Allies,  and Sinn Fein leaders cohf i&apos;v,d-. nfly assured their followers that England was &quot;b-,atcn to the ropes&quot; and that Germany was pledged to secure Irish Independence.     Most of th,se leaders are now interned.v(vw O.       -In the altered circumstances it is difficult to predict what would happen oh the introduction of an Order in Council enforcing Conscription.The Church, with the exception of a few excitable- priests, has for some time been silent on the subject: but the Clergy, as a body are in thorough sympathy with their parishioners in opposition to Military Service,  and many of the younger members are bitterly anti-English.     Therefore, if Conscription ,is enforced they may   /

The extremists will attempt to blow up railway bridges and public buildings, and v.ill probably organise attacks on soldiers and policemen, end persons in authorityc     This eould oi course quickly culminate in violent disorder on an extensive scale, which in-iorrnant says will not be put down without bloodshed.There is beyond doubt liaison between the labour and Sinn Fein leaders, and there is good reason to believe that explosives have been accumulated for this purpose.Up to the year 1914. Sinn Pein v/cs regarded as a negligible political force.     Its extravagant policymade no serious impression.     Following tho outbreakof ./ar, however, came the dread of Conscriptio.no     Thismenace was eagerly seised on by the Irish Volunteersand Sinn Fein Clubs as a recruiting bait for theirorganization oi&apos; which, in the opinion of the Police, itis the mainstay, and which has expanded during the war froma membership of about 12,000 to 110,000.Although a large section of extremists still cling to the policy of an Irish Republic, und would be ready to rise in rebellion for this object, others are believed to hold more moderate views.Tho Sinn Fein revolutionary movement is controlled from Dublin and is reputed to be short of arms and ammun-ition.   Ho arms are known to have been imported recently.j(Signed)   J.
