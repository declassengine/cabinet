- (TnLs Document jr. tho Property of:.    nicjyiajesty^ Governmentr 5 CAG//^X    /*)My colleagues will have received Memoranda from the Lord Lieutenant and the Chief Secretary.   I find myself not in complete agreement with either, and I desire very briefly to state my views.I do not share the Chief Secretary&apos;s opinion that Home Rule is desirable or that Conscription will cause great bloodshed, and I think that his anticipa--tion of the attitude of the Police is mistaken.   But, on the other hand, I cannot share the view widely-held as to the opposition to Conscription, for while I agree that it will not be prolonged, and that it can be put down comparatively easily by force of arms, I believe that priests and women will &quot;in the early stages lead the opposition, and I am very doubtful whether parliament would allow any Government to con-tinue repressive measures after one or two priests and a few women have been shot by the soldiers,I think it is also worthy of consideration whether the soldiers we have got in Ireland, who are either of the territorial class, or raw recruits, could be relied upon to take part in what would be really a form of civil war, and I cannot imagine any-^ thing more deplorable, or more injurious to the success-ful prosecution, of the War, and to the good of the United Kingdom as a whole, than to commence a campaign of Conscription and then have to abandon it.   Lookingat
at it solely from the point of view of the Government of Ireland, or from the wiobr standpoint from which I have already approached it, I should say that the best course would be to attempt neither Home Rule nor Conscription, but to instruct the Lord Lieutenant to continue the assertion of the law, and to restore Ireland to a oondition of obedience to the law and peaceful progress before attempting anything else. But there is this very serious consideration.  The Govern-ment announced their determination to introduce Conscription in Ireland;    On the faith of this pledge they obtained the extra powers which the Minister if National Service is now enforcing in the rest of the United Kingdom,    $heir decrees were defied by the Irish Hierarchy, and there can be no doubt that if Conscription is abandoned it will be regarded as a triumph for the Hierarchy and this must have a very serious and unfortunate effect upon the stability and prestige of Government in Ireland.   Therefore, the course that I recommend on the whole, is that an op-portunity should be taken by the Lord Lieutenant in Ireland, and by the Leaders in Parliament, to announce that Conscription is still the policy of the Govern-ment., its hej,d in reserve, but cannot be enforced be-cause the prior duty obtains of making the law effective in that country, and it would not be difficult to show that the moment is not one when it is desirable to run the risk of grave local disturbances in orderto
to get men who may not be required.I attach great importance to the views ex-pressed by Mr. Gwynn in the Memorandum circulated by the Ministry Of National Servioe.   I know Mr.Gwynn well.   He is entirely opposed to Conscription, but he is genuinely anxious that Ireland shall take her share, and the fact that he is prepared to consider Conscriptions and even to recommend it within certain limitations, has great weight with me, and I would make great sacrifices to carry men like Mr.Gwynn, Mr. 0&apos;&apos;Sullivan K.C and others who belong to the Irish Nationalist party with us in any steps that we take,Ijirge that a Cabinet shall be held without delay, in order to decide what the policy of the Government is going to be, because, till the Govern-ment in London has made up its mind upon the broad lines of policy it is impossible for the Government of Ireland to act with any decision or any prospect of success.Owing to important engagements in Ireland the Lord Lieutenant and Chief Secretary cannot be present before Monday.w*.HoL.9th October, 1918,
