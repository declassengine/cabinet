.&amp;30RiiiT, G*T,5QS4.ftThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Maje8ty&apos;s Government,.............. &amp; y /CONTROL   0F,XNDIA&apos;S   OUTPUT   OF.  RAILS.of letter, dated loth October, 1918, from Under Secretary ofStatft, India &quot;Office, to Secretary, &quot;&quot;^War, Offioe.(Circulated with reference to Paper G.T.6892),41585,   , Sir,I am directed by the Secretary cf State fbr India in Council to address you with reference to the Memorandum 57/16/7958 (Secret) dated 6th October submitted by the Chieff -   of the Imperial General Staff io the War Cabinet on the Subject&apos;J-,T*   ef India&apos;s output of Rails *j*8S2.tfhe Oiaim advahoed in the Memorandum is that the Army Council Controls and should continue to control the output and disposal of all rails made in India, and in support of this claim it is stated that the India Office in a telegram dated the 25th June 1917 definitely omferred this authority on the War Office.I am to observe that Mr. Montagu is unable to agree that the telegram referred to oan.be so interpreted.     Its impart was much more limited.    In 1917 the Government of India had taken steps V increase the manufacture in Indiaif rails&apos;and ther&apos;munitivns t   meet m..re fully fr.m Indian g-urdes their cvm requirements and t? provide a surplus which would W at the dispsal cf the .Ministry cf Munitions and the War Office.     S-me uncertainty arose as tt? the channel thr- ugh ,which the require-ments -f the home Government should be made tawn to the Indian authorities, and this question Was referred t*&quot; the India Office &quot;by the Government   f India.    After consulting the War Office and the Ministry. ;;f Munitions, &quot;Mr.. Seoretary Chamberlain decided in c-nf ,rmity with their wishes that, as the Ministry cf Munitions was responsible for the&apos; supply qf railway materials and the War Offloe f:r alloeation and shipment, the former department should correspond with the Government of India through the India Offioe regarding &quot;manufacture and supply, and the latter direct with the Commander-in-Chief as to        allocation and shipment.    Thisie the still existing arrangement.    But under it the War Offioe no mere has p&apos;*wer tv dispose cf the whele -utput of railB in India and all-cate it t: places beyond seas without regard to the civil and military requirements cf the G-vernment &apos;-f India than it has to dispose :f tr^-pe on the Indian establishment and send them cut of India witheut the       . permission -.f. the Indian Government.Mr. Montagu feels it hiB duty tt: make elear the unquestionable rights :,f the Indian Government in this matter, as a question of first principles is involved.    But he fully recognises the vital importance cf subordinating in tho greatest prsoiblo degree during the war the civil and military needs of India, a3 regards not only rails and munitions but alsc. men and materiel of all kinds, t-. the requirements cf ether theatres cf war, and he is at all times anxious that.the Government of   . India and its military advisers sh;:uld in. their disposltlone fir the defence cf India be guidodb$r tho advice of the War Office and conform ty the general strategic p: llcy indicated to them.     In tho particular matter &apos;-f tho allocation cf the output ;,f the Tata Stool and Ir*n W^rka during the next few months, Mr. Montagu, in f awarding t: the War Offioe a telegram/ 37589cf 24th Sept. 1918.
from the Government of India explaining that on full consideration of their oosontial needs they reguirod Tata&apos;s output up tc the end of December, stated that as at present advised ho was in agreement with the viceroy.     He is prepared to aok the Indian Government to reconsider the matter if the Army Council will furnish him with a reasoned statement which&apos; he oan lay befsro them;   and he is inclined to think the matter should be capable of aooommodatian,    Dut on constitutional greunds he must demur to the olaim advanced in the Hemo. submitted by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to the Army Council.I . &amp;fcye frfce iibnour to Tee, flir, Your obedient Borvant, (Signed)   T,W,Holderness,The Secretary,War Office,
