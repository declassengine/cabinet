It will be observed that after making allowanco for increased out mt of coal through an increased effort by tht men now ongagsd in the mines, tho shortage is estimated at 14$ million tons for tho 12 months ended June 1919. This deficit can only bo met in ono of two ways, (a) by   . reducing the amount of industrial coal for manufacturers in this country, (b) by returning a sufficient number of skilled men from the Army.    If tho first alternativo is adooted by tho &apos;?ar Cabinet tho Coal Controller estimates that 500,000 or moro work-people will bo thrown out of emoloyment arid 1 suggest that some provision should be made for allowing thoso people some part of their wages while unemployed.    There is another point for the attontion of tho V/ar Cabinet.    The deficit of 14$ million makes no provision for increased coal for munition factories which lias oeen estimated at about 4i million- tons, and although tho ministry of ignitions have agreed to withdraw this demand I understand that the recent expenditure of shells is so heavy that this increased demand may be found accessary.    This would increase the deficit to 19 million tons.    The increasing demands for the American Army in France is also a c^use for anxiety and it has been represented to me that unless we can guarantee their full demands&quot;&quot; their military programme would be affected.    I may add that at the request of the Coal Controller General Nash lias carefully gone into thoir demands arid reoorts that they arc not excessive. iJoth the Goal Controller and myself are addressing meetings of miners and officials and a very extensive publicity Press and Advertising campaign is in full swing, and I am hopeful that those measures will bo helpful.    On the ot nor nard cJir Adam I.immo is of opinion that tho output cannot be substantially increased by those moans and that if we&quot;succeed in avoiding local strikes a..d main-taining the present position.we shall have accomplished all that can bo expected.    It is  of the utmost importance that the War Cabinet come&apos; to a final decision on this matter at a very early date so that we m - know the amount of coal that will be available to ^ut into operation a schemo of rationing for industries and to notofy the American Authorities the amount of coal which will bo allocated to that.I would add that if more men are to be returned from tho Army no publicity be given to the decision and that there bo no relaxing cur efforts to increase the output par men employed.Board of Trade, 7th October, 1918.
MEMIHANDUM to the PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OP TRADE FOR WAR CABINET., Return of Miners from the Army.Some four woeks havo now elapsed since my application, for tho return of 50,000 grade 1 miners.(or thoir equivalent) from tha* Army was discussed by the War Cabinot, and there are a few obser-vations which I must add.1*    Offlseoueriooa of Intotyja^agUQning.    I have recoiyed from accreditod ropresontatives of some of tho trade and industries concerned, the following figures shewing the amount of unemploy-ment which may bo anticipated as a minimum as tho result of Industrial Rationing.Cotton Mills 207,000.Woollens .     90,000.Bleachers, Dyers,) Finishers etc,    )     19,000 Silk spinners. 10,000Laco workers 10,400The Pottery Industry says that with a 2SF&amp; out they &quot;will struggle on&quot;, but anything muoh above this will close down the Industry which employs 45.000 bands.    I wish to point out that this is of course only a limited number of industries with regard to which special enquiries have been made.2.   fihajqiges in Mgsii ,andJfemA,  At the interview tho PrimeMinister had with Mr.Vernqn Hartshorn, tho latter suggested that possibly an incroase of B/o in output could be expected from the miners.    This would give an increased out;mt of 12  million tons, but the best opinion which it has been possible to obtain since the date .of tne interview, puts the figure at the most at 2 million tons.   Uany eoal owners havo very grave doubts whether even this figure will be reached.In view of the fact that we have now reached the month of October, I think it is only safe to budget on the Coal Position up to the end of June next.Even with an increased effort on the part of the miners, the maximum output for the twelve months onding June next is estimated to be 227,000,000 tons.    For that period I under-stand the Ministry of itmitions is prepared to give up the extra 5,000,000 tons per annum askod for this year.    The French demands from the beginning of 1918 will probably fall by 350,000 tons pe* jimth.     Up to now wo have budgeted for 2f million tons: per annum for the American Expeditionary Force, but they haver&apos;&apos; not recoivod this quantity.    These demands are now on tho ascending scale and for the six months ending June next the demand is put at 3,583,000 tons; the monthly figures being as follqws ; ,January, 438,000February 482,000March 551,000April 620,000% 705,000i         June 787,000! 3,583,000 Tons.4
(Np,2tOQntiMe(U. &quot; &quot;At my request General Nash has gone fully into the&quot; matter with the Americans, and he writes me as follows:-&quot;The Americans, have in my opinion, made a very careiul and at the .same time conservative estimate of the requirements, in fact they have under-estimated to some extent. &quot;It wij.1 be ^een from this that &quot;the American demand we have eventually Lo budget for is 600,000 tons per month more than we havo hitherto budgeted for.other) I have made no provision for any increase in consumption of the/Alliod Armies in the event of the lines of communication being extended.&quot;Assuming no other increased demands.from the Admiralty, Neutrals, &amp;c, the following table represents the estimated position to the 20i)i June 1919:-Output for IE months ending June 1918.Estimated&apos;output for 12 months ending June 1919.Deficit.239,000,000 tons. 227,000,000 tons,. * *12,000,000 tons.Increased Demands.Admiralty.       2,500France &amp; Italy. 3,500Acuerican Exped-   &apos; itionary Force. 4,000Neutrals. 2,500Agriculture &amp;Economies,Food.

Progress of Release a; from thejkrmy.    My application is for the $(julvaleiat of 50,000 gralta 1 mine re&apos;  on the conditions thrt I am prepared to accept &quot;LI1&apos; men as equivalent to &quot;A&quot; men, thai I am not prepared to accept more than 25,000 men of category lower than &quot;&quot;31&quot;, as places cannot bo found in the mines for ar undue proportion of men of inferior physique;   and that men below &quot;81&quot; count as throe-fifths of a &quot;Bl&quot;   or &quot;A&quot; man.So far, there have been actually returned to the minesaccording to the War Office figuresup to and including 27th September .............. 10,411(these men oomo from the Home Army and I haveroason to erpoct, say a total of................ 81,000from this source.The Air Board estimate that their comb-outwill yield me................................. 3,000and the Admiralty estimate from Haval Services(harbour and shore)............................. JL.,000^if(The foregoing may yield a combined total of.. 85,000of whom I estimate that anly about 8$ will be ^__^&quot;Bl&quot; men and none of higher category, so that interms of &quot;A&quot; and MB1W aexLtotal would be......... 15,000Leaving as a balance tho equivalent of ..........    34,800short of my application.(The War Office are now engaged in oombing-out the Labour&quot;Corps in franco and by this means hope to obtain some 9,000 to 10,000 men, most of whom will be of category &quot;Bl&quot;.from what source and by what machinery are the balance of 25,000 or more to oome.From the point of view of speed in release and immediate \ effect upon coal output, there is no cmestion in my opinion, taatthis balance should come from the 1918 recruits bo far as they still remain in this Country.    My Advisory Board of coal-owners and miners, though unaware that the Cabinet hafj this matter under consideration, unanimously passed a resolutjj last week recommending the re ton of the last&apos; 25,000 miners It recruited in 1918, as beinj? the only means to an immediate improvement in output.I admit that from the point of view of morale both in th Army and in tho coal mines there is a great deaT&apos;to be said for releasing the overseas men who have soen several years service,,    3c*.t speed :.s vital, and unless I can get the men  \\ I want back to tha mines by the end of October, the ooal Situation will not be met.If it.is not met, I Imagine (though I cannot speak \ authority) tl:f.t; the affect&apos; on the morale of the Army oversea-&apos; of receiving i::on h&quot;me bitter complaints of unemployment and inadequata heating would not be good, and might &quot;be worse thaj that to     expected from the release of the 1918 recruits.
As to machinery, I am largely in the hands if the fighting Services and the Ministry of National Service, and xt irfor them to return the men by the speediest means known to them. If the War Cabinet decide to order the release of the over-seas men, I apprehend that (so far as concerns the Army) the War Office will extend the present scheme of combmg-out the Labour Corps by means of a selection Committee of Army offioers having coal-mining experience, regard being had to the need of insuring a fairly proportionate return to all the coalfields.   If, on the other hand, the decision is in favour of the 1918&quot;recruits, then, unless the Ministry*of National Service can with tne aid of the fighting services trace the men, I must press for some 3oheme of release in bulk such as has been recently applied to the Home Army and initiated by muster parades.   Inaividual^application by the soldiers takes too long. 1From whatever souroe and by whatever Machinery, the &apos; coal situation demands the return of the equivalent of 50.000 grade I pre-war miners back to the mines by the 31st October.I have been most reluctant to ask for men back from the Amy - nobody realises more than I do the difficulties whioh attend their withdrawal - and it was only when oonvinced against ay will that there was no alternative, that I put forward the request.  The recommendation made is not an excessive one m the hope of obtaining Something less, but the minimum of what I believe to be essential to pull the Country through this Winter, and indeed seeing that we are on the verge of Winter, and in view of the unexpected Ion of output Hue to the protracted duration of recruiting and to the Influenza Epidemic, my one fear is that I have cut my request too fine.The coal position at the present time is most serious, I know that the Ministry of Muittions have even now not got all the coal required in the various ramifications of the Department.  I have been compelled to divert coal from Munition Works to Household supplies, but notwithstanding ^lLst?P* the latter are seriously in arrears * in many parts of the Country,,and if we have an early Winter, I view the situation with which the Government will be faced, with great alarm,m OALTHHOP.
