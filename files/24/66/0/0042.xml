This Department is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.

Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.

G.T.5942

FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 9th October, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production in Ireland :-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Forty-one applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year, to date, under the Scheme, amounts to £86,194.

ALLOTMENTS.

The Department have notified Urban District Councils and Councils of County Boroughs in Ireland that a limited sum has been made available in the Department&apos;s Vote of Credit for the financial year 1918-19, for the payment of grants, not exceeding £2? per statute acre?, towards the expenses of fencing or adapting for cultivation lands acquired by such Councils for cultivation in allotments and used for this purpose during the current year in accordance with the Scheme approved by the Local Government Board. The conditions on which such grants may be made are as follows:-

(1) That the payments made by allotment holders are insufficient to cover the expenditure of the Council on fencing and adapting the lands for cultivation, in addition to meeting the rent, rates and taxes payable by the Council in respect of the lands;

(2) That the payments made to the Council by the allotment holders for the use of the lands are fair and reasonable;

(3) That the fencing or Work on adaptation carried out or proposed to be carried out by the Council on the land is necessary and suitable having regard to all the circumstances of the case;

(4) That the rent paid or payable by the Council for the use of the lands is not excessive.

Ordinarily the sums charged to the allotment holders should be sufficient to cover all the expenses incurred by the councils, i.e rents, rates, cost of fencing, etc. There may, however, be some cases, especially in the first year of occupancy, where Councils,

9/10/18.


owing to the difficulty in obtaining materials, the exceptionally high letting value of lands and other causes, may not find it possible to cover their expenditure on fencing by reasonable charges to the allotment holders, and it is to meet such exceptional expenditure that the grants in question are intended.

PROGRESS 0N THE HARVEST.

The weather during the earlier part of the week ending 5th inst. was generally favourable to harvesting operations, and a considerable quantity of cats was stacked in different parts of the country. In certain counties, however, portion of the crop is still in stock, and has suffered considerable damage. Where still uncut, outs are lying tossed and broken and producing a second growth.  In the Southern and Western counties generally most of the corn is now in stack.  Potatoes are reported to be yielding remarkably well, and the proportion of diseased tubers is less than usual. Lo lying fields are, however, holding the water and softening and blackening of the tubers has begun.  Farmers are being advised to lift the drop at the first favourable opportunity.  Root crops are improving but night frosts are cutting down mangel foliage. The pulling of mangels has commenced in a few early districts, and the crop in bulking fairly well. The ploughing of stubbles has begun in a number of countries.  Preparations are being made all over the country for sowing winter wheat, and already in one district a considerable area has been sown with winter oats. Pasture is plentiful but poor in quality.

FLAX.

Harvesting.   The lack of improvement in the weather during the past week has resulted in very little further having been done in connection with flax harvesting and seed saving.

Scutchers&apos; Dispute.    The attitude of the scutchers is not yet satisfactory, but until the grain harvest has been completed, and the scutch mills have been equipped with their improvements and ready to start, the position cannot be quite definitely ascertained   Flaxseed Saving Order.      As the season is now so advanced as to preclude the possibility of having steps taken by growers to save flax for seed purposes beyond what they have already saved, the Department are reducing the staff of Inspectors appointed by then for the purpose of the Flaxseed Saving Order.

The number of cases of breaches of this Order reported to date is 327.

DRAINAGE OF LAND.

The seasons during which works of cleaning and maintenance in drains and small rivers can usually be carried out is now drawing to a close, and the Department have been making every effort to get all outstanding works completed before the winter comes on. The work generally, has, however, been very seriously impeded during the past three weeks by heavy rain resulting in the flooding of drains and the postponement of urgent work. Opportunities of executing drainage work for this season have been few and even

effective   
offeytivo inspection has in man:/ das^s been impossiblo.   If weather conditions improve, muoh may yet bop done, but otherwise it is feared that the results of tho seasonfs uorV. will not be as good as had boen hoped for.&apos;,J.II&amp;V A1T0L&apos; OF LIVL STOCK.During tho period from 1st to 7th instant, inclusive, 145 applications for lioenoos to daughter or export hoifor:-,, 90 applications for licences to export store hoifero and eighty applications for licences to slaughter bulls or bullocks wore received.   One hundred and si;;; applications for licences to expert milch cfrws also came to hand.During the same period, 27 liocncoa wore issued undor the Irisi Pigs (Control)(Ireland) Order, 1910, and the Pig and Piz Products (Ireland) Order, 1018.
