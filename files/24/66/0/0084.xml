Thlfl Or,1 11 277S E C R E T, 0,1/178/510.Copy No,12NOTE by the Chief of tho Imperial General Staff on Admiralty Memorandum. (G.T.5962)I agree with the 1st Sea Lord&apos;3 Paper and I only add a short Note in order to strengthen his arguments.   After the Dardanelles and Bosphorous have been opened, and after we (British) have got command of the Black Sea it is exceedingly likely that we may wish to pass troops through and send one or more Expeditionary Forces to Constanza or Odessa or Sebastapol to gain touch with the Roumanians and friendly South Russians, or to Poti or Batoum or Trebizond to move into the Caucasus or on to the Caspian and to hold out a hand to the Czechos,All, or almost all, the troops to be used for such enterprises will be ours, and all, or almost all, the transports and escorts will bo ours.This seems to me to be an added reason for adopting the proposals made by the 1st Sea Lord.14th October 1918,(Signed)   HENRY WILSON,C a I o Oa S a
