cm 9 ht I wTHE GIMAJ REPLY TO PRESIDENT WILSON1 S NOTE.THE PRIMS MINISTER said that he had summoned this Confer-enoe to consider two points(1) The next step which the Allies should take:(3) What communication should be made to the Press.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, as regards the second point, it appeared to him necessary to indicate to the Pie ss that Presi-dent Wilson was alone responsible for the negotiations up to this point;   also that we could not accept the principle of the Freedom tof the Seas included in the &quot;Fourteen Points&quot;;   and that the guar- fIantees for agreeing an armistice must be greater than mere evacua-tion of the occupied territories.   The Germanshe pointed out, were now in a panic   If they could not obtain a respite they might suffer disaster.   On the contrary, if they could gain some respite they might obtain time to re-organise and&quot;recover.LORD MILKER said that the Press ought not to be encouraged to discuss the Fourteen Points at all, but only the conditions of an armistice.Mr BALPOUR pointed out the difficulty that the terms of an armistice must be made so stiff as to prevent any renewal of hostilities.   There were several additional terms that would have to be included in the final Peace over and. above President Wilsons Fourteen Points:   for example, ton-for-ton. and punishment for the crimes of Germany in the War.   If we were to grant an armistice, -would not Germany say that we were precluded from raising any fresh points beyond President Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Points?THE PRIME MINISTER said that President Wilson had practically promised to suggest an armistice on the condition that the occupied territories were evacuated.   That, at any rate, was the natural interpretation of his Mote by the ordinary man.LORD MILNEH expressed the view that all President Wilson had said was that the enemy must evacuate the occupied- territories before he would even propose an armistice.
i *^ 1 6(President Wi3,3pnfs reply to the German appeal r for an. ariaistj oe was then read to the Confer,-enoer-,ana there was some discus sin n as, to the precise significance of his words ,T&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in the circumstances, we werepractically bound to demand disarmament ag a condition of anarmistice,Mr CHURCHILL said that, taking into account the number of guns that the Germans had captured, and their present output, they would be able rapidly to reouperate.GENERAL WILSON said that the enemy were short of supplies for the length of line they were holding today.   In order to hold the shortest defensive line on the Western Front, however, their material might prove sufficient.   In his view, &quot;Pile your arms&quot; should be the main condition of the armistice.Mr CHURCHILL pointed Out the difficulty on our side of start -ing again once an armistice had been entered into,   Even after disarmament, the enemy would still&apos; be able to maintain a very formidable front if they decided to start on a purely defensive -form of warfare.   It was impossible to stop the production of armaments until a real guarantee was obtained that fighting could not start again&apos;.THE PRIME MINISTER then raised the question as to whether it was desirable, at the present time, to have peace at all.Mr BALFOUR said that, if. a conclusive peace could be obtained,, it was;   otherwise it was not,THE PRIMR MINISTER then raised for consideration the question as to whether the actual military defeat of Germany and the giving to the German people of a real taste of war was not more important, from the point of view of the peace of the world, than a surrender at the present time when the German Armies were still on foreign territory.   Up to the present the fighting this year had really been ding-dong, and there was no very great, difference between the numbers of prisoners and guns taken by the enemy and the Allies Was it, he asked, worth stopping the fighting unless Germany was really badly beaten?Mr BQNAR JAW asked whether any terns could be more complete than those imposed on Bulgaria, which might also be imposed on
(j i (i(d Germany?   If the troops had to leave their-g\ms.,and^.riXles behind, the defeat would be as complete as anyone could wish.Mr BALPOUR said that the main test of victory was territoryv If Germany was stripped of Alsace-Lorraine, which she had always asseverated she would never surrender;   if she was stripped of German Poland, including even Posen as well as half of Silesia;- if she was stripped of half the areas in which were produced her steel and coal, the War could never be represented in Germany as anything but a complete defeat.   This appeared to him far more important than the bombarding of a new- German towns, although he admitted he would like to have seen this.   In addition to what he had mentioned, Austria, Germany&apos;s principal ally, would have been destroyed.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that, if peace were made now, the Allies would not have occupied a yard of German soil.   While pointing out that historical comparisons were not always very valuable, he compared the present situation to the Second Punic War.   The Romans might have made peace by insisting on Carthage clearing out of Italy and Spain.   The Romans, however, said that this was not enough, that they must actually invade Carthagirr-ian territory and achieve victory on Carthaginian soil.   History has shown that they were right.&apos;Mr BALPOUR hoped that this analogy, which might be summed up in the words &quot;delenda est Carthago&quot;; should not be used in public.GENERAL WILSON., in reply to.a question as to what it would mean to force the War on to German soil, replied that the present opportunity of disarming Germany now should be taken. Otherwise the Germans would put up a great fight on their own frontier, and he wished to put this out of their power.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that-, if peace were made now, in twenty years&apos; time the Germans would say what Carthage had said about the First Punic War, namely., that they had made this mistake and that mistake, and that by better preparation and organisation they would be able to bring about victory next time.
Hr CHURCHILL suggested, that if the Freedom of the Seas was   ;- &apos; &apos;    &apos; i &apos; &apos; i&apos;    &apos; &apos; 1whittled down to our interpretation, and the remainder of the Fourteen Point3 were screwed up to the interpretation wo wished put upon them, the situation would be all right,   that he feared., however, was that the Germans were putting their construction on all the points, including Freedom of the Seas.   They would also insist that all the Fourteen Points held together, and that they could not use them as a basis for peace unless they were all adopted with their interpretation^   If they did this, and mean-time re-organised their military power, we should have to order the Allied Armies to advance, and this would be a very difficult thing to do while the Germans were sitting still and saying that, they were quite prepared to carry out President Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Points according to their own interpretation.Mr BGNAR LAI? pointed out that this was not quite Kir Lloyd George&apos;s point..   That he wanted to know was whether, if the Ger-maris accepted terras so humiliating as the laying down of their arms, would the humiliation be sufficient to prevent them from making war in the future.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that in a short time the Germans would say that these miserable democrats had taken charge and had become panic-stricken, and the military party would get in power again.   The question arose as to whether we ought not to inflict an even more humiliating defeat on them&apos;.Mr BONAR LAW said there were two points:-(1) Whether any Peace negotiated now could be sufficiently humiliating to crush Prussian militarism;(2) Whether, after once entering into an armis-tice, we could get the Allied Armies to, fight again,Mr HALFOUR repeated that he rather differed from thePrime Minister on the first point.   It appeared to him a fargreater defeat to give up territory, such as Alsace-Lorraine,which they had held for 40 years;&apos; Posen and Silesia, which theyhad held for 130 years;   to see her principal Ally, Austria,smashed for ever; and to lose her Colonies;   than merely tobe beaten on German soil.

He wished to remind then, however, that at the moment an armistice was entered into we were absolutely done.Mr CHURCHILL agreed, unless we had the Kiel Canal or some great bridgehead in our possession,THE PRIME MINISTER said, the second point was as to what steps should now be taken.   Should the Allies wait until they heard from President Wilson, or should they proceed at once to Prance, or should they send a communication to President Wilson?ADMIRAL WEMYSS said that, from the Naval point of view, the great difficulty arose over the Freedom of the Seas,   He had had this question, examined from every point of view, and it was clear that the step was directed absolutely against the British Navy.

Theoretically, up to this point we should not be entitled to interfere with her.   In reply to the Prime Minister, he said that Germany would also be in a position to obtain rubber, and the blockade would become a thing of the past.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this was very important, since blockade had been the primary factor in defeating Austria, and a very important one in defeating Germany&apos;.Mr CHURCHILL pointed out that blockade out both ways.   The German submarine so-called blockade had made a great drain upon our military resources, and reduced us probably by some 30 Divi-sions.Mr BALFOUR said the question could not be discussed, from a historic/point of view, because President Wilson looked at the question of Freedom of the Seas entirely from the- point of view of the League of Nations.   There was no doubt about the German interpretation of &quot;Freedom of the Seas&quot;, which, was that it meant that no power should remain with us which would give us any advantage at sea, and they even demanded the abandonment of such places as Gibraltar,   The Americans, however, as he understood the matter, had never advocated the abolition of blockade,THE PRIME MINISTER then read the actual words, of President Wilson&apos;s statement on the Freedom of the Seas, which were as foilowe:-&quot;Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas outside territorial waters alike in peace and in war, except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of international&apos;covenants,&quot; .Mr B ALP OUR suggest-ed that we should not object to theFreedom of the Seas if the League of Nations had stopped all warsHe asked if any case could be quoted in such circumstances wherewe should be put at a disadvantage.
&amp; ADMIRAL WEMYSS tfead an extract from a Memiorandura^e^had-^pro paired on the subject.SIR MAURICE HANKEY suggested that the answer to Mr Balfour*a-question&apos; was that the League of Nations might collapse within an hour or two, whereas sea-power could only be exercised by years of preparation,   If, therefore, we allowed our sea-power and our means of enforcing it to dwindle, trusting in the League of Ka-tions, we might find ourselves at a great disadvantage when the-League of Rations collapsed, which even its staunohest advocates, like Lord Robert Cecil, admitted it might..Mr CHURCHILL asked what would be our position if, at the end of the present War, after we had entered into a League of Nations, India gave trouble:   should  we be hauled up before a League of Nations before we could deal with it?Mr BALFOITR said that this was not the case, and that in the case of India, Ireland, and other territory, our hands would be perfectly free.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there were now two questions to be answered.   The first was, should we assent to President Wilson1a first proposition, that we should be willing to discuss Peace on the basis that we accept all the Fourteen Points?   He pointed out that, if we did accept, the implication would be that we agreed in them.   Germany had accepted the Fourteen Points and had assumed that we did also.Mr BALF0UR said we could not possibly assent to them.THE PRIME MINISTER said the second point was that the Germans assumed that President Wilson had laid down conditionsitfor an armistice.   There were two assumptions that might be made. The first was that President Wilson did not agree with the German contention that he had laid down the conditions of an armistice. The second assumption was that he did agree.Mr BONAR LAW pointed out that President Wilson, by his Note to the Allies, had already made it clear that he did not accept the German contention.
Mr&quot; BA.LFOTTR-at 4,.that&apos;-^.he&apos;*&amp;r.3 wsr to the-fXvet^olrrt^-al/whl^by&apos; VAe Prime Minister was that we did &quot;not-aoe-ept the Fourteen Points. On the second point, it was clear that we could not accept Presi-dent Wilson&apos;n conditions as representing the terms of an armistice.Mr CHURCHILL said to- saw great difficulties about riot agr*ee-ing to the Fourteen Points, which had a very presentable appear-anc e t o the v?o rtti,iir BALFOUfti reverting to. the question of the Fourteen Points,raised two questions(I) Ought we not to add to the Fourteen Points: for- example, the question of Ton-for-Toni(2) Bid we ourselves know what interpretation we put on them?THE&apos;PRIMS MINISTER drew attention to No,3,&quot;The removal, so far as possible, of all econ-omic barriers and the establishment of an equal-it y of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating them-selves for its maintenance.&quot;President Wilson was a Free Trader pure and simple, and this was,certainly a disputable point,Mr BALF0U.R said what President Wilson failed to understandwas that, however successful a &quot;League of Nations might be, theremust be a transition period while it was being established.Mr CHURCHILL said that he would accept the Fourteen Points,provided we could plr.ce our own interpretation on - them,LORD READING suggested that President Wilson should be askedat once to send over Colonel House, or some other person who hadhis whole mind, in order to give an.explanation of the FourteenPoints,   At present they :were much too vague. . Would it be possi-ble, he asked, for the-. British Government to assent?- to. theseFourteen Points without even knowing what they meant?   At any rafeethey could not allow such points as repan/&apos;ion for seamen, which*?e had stated in our own terms, to be omitted,THE PRIME MINISTER said we. must formulate our own conditionsLORD READING pointed out there would be a great outcry bylUie public if the British Government accepted Freedom of the Seas-
9 0 f)THE PRIME MINISTER said that then we must add to the Fourteen Points Naval reparation for the sinking of merchant ships, and for the families of seamen.   Thi3 was a thing the people would fight for.Mr BALPOUR then read the telegram sent to Washington as the result of the Allied Conference in Paris, putting the point of view of the Allies in regard to the armistice.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this telegram put our point of view very clearly, and President Wilson had accepted it,GENERAL WILSON suggested that the next step was for President Wilson to notify us that now he would like to know the conditions of an armistice.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that, before doing so, he ought to telegraph to the Central Powers at once that they were wrong in assuming that the evacuation of the occupied territories was the condition of an armistice.   He thought we should tell President Wilson that at once.LORD READING said fchat, on the previous day, he had communi-cated with Sir William Wiseman, putting the Prime Minister&apos;s point of view.   We might assume, therefore, that President Wilson knew what we felt.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in reply to a telegram from Sir Eric Geddes asking him what line he was to take up in a speech to be made in America on October 14,. he had warned him that he should on no account express approval or disapproval of President Wilson&apos;s Note to Germany.LORD READING proposed that the Government should make a sug-gestion to President Wilson as to what was in their minds.   Other-wise he was afraid lest President Wilson might act prematurely. He was rather in the habit of retiring into his room and working alone.   Moreover, he probably believed that he was:manoeuvring Germany into.a difficult situation.   We did not want him to come to us and ask us for the temns of an armistice before he had made it quite clear to Germany that his, previous Note had not laid down the conditions of an armistice.   On September 27 the President had
U u 1prepared the way for stiff conditions by stating that Germany could not be trusted and that we must have adequate^^guajjantee^.-eto.   &apos;7hat we now wanted him to do was to telegraph to Germany saying that, in order to avoid any misunderstanding, he oonsid-ered it necessary to notify them that his Note had not stated the conditions of an armistice, and that these would depend mainly upoh military considerations.   The Germans might say that they -were willing to submit to onerous terms, but that they would not disarm until they knew how much was to be left to them.   The next question, perhaps, was to ask President Wilson what additional terms were to be added to the Fourteen Points, and what was the meaning of these Points.THE PRIME MINISTER said that all this discussion brought him back to his old view, that the important thing was to have a very carefully drawn armistice.Mr CHURCHILL suggested that the conditions of the armistice should be entirely disabling, and that Germany should be asked to put the worst construction on her ultimate fate.Mr BALFOUR agreed that, even so, additions would be re-quired.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that we must add articles dealing with the maritime situation.LORD READING repeated his/proposal to get some American, whom the President could trust, sent over,THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that this meant postponing the decision for some three weeks,Mr CHURCHIIL said that public opinion would not&quot; stand a delay of three weeks.   The next step, therefore, was to getPresident Wilson to do what we wish.At this point (Afecx/an aq,ToiOrnment was made for half an hour. while Mr Balfour and others prepared spedimen draft telegrams asT basis of discussion.)On re-assemblylur BALFOUR said that since the adjournment he had received, from a very secret but absolutely reliable source, information
to the effect that, aa late aa October 9, tha Gentians, while con templating the acceptance of President Wilson&apos;a terms, were resolved not to surrender the whole of Alsace-Lorraine, or the whole of the Polish areas.   The inference, he pointed out, was that they hoped both to accept President Wilson&apos;s terms and to argue at the Peace Conference over the interpretation even of those conditions which appeared to be most explicitly stated. The German Press had been asked not to discuss single points raised-by President Wilson, hut fefc&amp;x German agents in&apos;certain neutral countries had been warned to take th :: line that it was impossible, on economic grounds, for the Germans to retire from the whole of Alsace-Lorraine, which was the main source of raw materials for their steel industry\ while for political reasons they would not retire from Poland.THE PRIME MNISTER pointed out that this supported what he had said, that Germany would never evacuate Poland.After some discussion, the Conference agreed -That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send two telegrams to Washington, for the President of the United States, in the following sense:-(i) Acceptance of Peace Terms by Germany.   It is presumed that the President in his answer to. Germany will make it clear that he never had in mind the granting of an armistice simply on an undertaking by Germany to retire from occupied territory.   His telegram to the Allies5 stating cleanly that this was merely the condition necessarily precedent to ths Informing of the Associated Governments by the president of trie German proposals, makes this of course evident.   We are doubtful, how-* ever, if Germany appreciates that the sole terms on which the Associated Powers will agree to a discontinuance of hostilities must be&apos;those whioh will, in the-opinion of experts, not only Military but ,Naval, make the resumption of hostilities by the Central Powers impossible. We consider it roost important that, the Gov-ernment of Germany should be at once publicly informed exactly how the case stands.(iij It appears that Germany has accepted theFourteen Points laid down by President Wilson and supplemented by his later speeches *   We ; are in full agreement with the general tenor of the Presidents policy.   It has, however, to be observed (1) that the Associated Powers have never discussed these points,  (2) that   &apos; some of them can be interpreted in various
Qi f) f&amp; V&apos; fa fa i)ways, to certain of which we should have strong,ob^motion; (8) that probably there are other ten id t o whioh the Preaident his not referred (as, for o*tvnple, those deal-inn with outrages on shipping) which must be included if full justice i* to be ?;;aet-ed.   To us it would seem that care -aust be taken that the conditions cf an armistice do not deprive the Allies of the freedom of action necessary at the Pence Conference in- the settlement of,final terms;   also that the principal belligerent Powers should immediately take steps ai-.oro* themselves to arrive at an agreement on points in doubt.2, Whitehall Gardens,;o &quot;irl.) $ iiOctober 14, 1918.v
