IS XOfabiJlA IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAgSTY^S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET.   I  (/r WAR CABINET. g/bjft  G.T. %?S8.STATEMENT OF THE SHIPPING PROBLEM.Memorandum by Alljed Maritime TransportCouncil.The Allied Maritime Transport Council have strongly recommended, that in view of the importance of restricting other services in order to transport munitions and Amerioan Army supplies, the several Governments should issue a full public statement of tho shipping position&apos;,Sir Joseph Maclay and myself agree that a statement in the attached form is what is wanted.Such an announcement would bo very useful at the present juncture, as it would both encourage the publio to the concentration of effort no&quot;T required and would indicate to the enemy that we aro making such an effort.The Allied representatives of tho Transport Council in London also agree as to the form of statement.In submitting the Memorandum for Cabinet approval I would propose to ask that the precise time of issue should be loft to the discretion of the Foreign Office.     Certain of the details (e,g, tho figures as to building and losses as to which later information might be available at the tine of issue) might also &quot;be regarded as subject to adjustment with the Admiralty, etc,I should be glad, however, to have Cabinet approval now to the general form of statement.(Intd.)   R. C.14th October, 1918.V.
The Government desire to cell attention to the statement of the general Shipping position as laid before the Allied Maritime Transport Council and printed below.It is obviously of extreme importance that all Allied tonnage should be used in such a way ft3 best to assist the prosecution of the V/ar.       For this purpose, the British Government, as already announced, has associated itself with the Governments of the United States, France and Italy in the Allied Maritime Transport Council/ whose duty it is to watch over the general conduct of Allied transport and while leaving&apos; each nation responsible for the management and supervision of the tonnage under its own control to secure the necessary exchange of information and co-ordination in policy and effort on the part of the four dovernments.On the advice of the above Allied organisation the British Government, after a comprehensive review Of the whole tonnage situation, have decided that It is their duty to the Allies to allocate a substantial number of British vessels for the immediate purpose of conveying supplies for the American Army.     This, in addition to the present assistance to France and Italy, which remains necessary and is being continued, has been rendered possible by an improvement In the harvests and by a development of the Shipping and Supply organisation of the Allies as a whole, including America.It could not, however, be faced but for the assurance of the Government that the public will beprepared
prepared to make every possible sacrifice which will help to achieve an early and victorious conclusion of the War.The general Shipping position is shewn in the following brief statement presented to the Council of the losses and new building of vessels (exclusive of small craft) In the first eight months of this year.Losses (all causes)3 European All x e s (GtTBrTbain, France,Italy)United States.Other AlliesNeutrals.(Japau&quot;,Tfussia, (Norway,hol 1 and,Brazil,Greece, &apos;Sweden,Spain Portugal, Denmark.)Belgium). .d.w.tonnage      d*w.tonnage d.w.tonnage   d*w.tonnage2,819,000387,000222,000396,000Building1,679,000      1,798,000470,000169,000Net Loss orGain1,140,000   x 1,411,000   x   248,000227,000During this period therefore America has built nearly one and a half million tons deadweight more vessels than she has lost but she has needed all these and more besides to transport and maintain her rapidly increasing forces In Prance.The general Allied shipping position is thus, that the Allies are now building more ships than they are losing but not so many more as the additional number required for the American Army in France.The European Allies have, on the other hand, lost a 11tie-over one million tons more than they have built and as it is for the present necessary for British tonnage to assist in both the transportation and supply of American tonnage, the need for economy and rigid restriction of all import commodities is greater than ever.it/
It Is true ,that the submarine has failed in its 284first object which was to reduce the military strength of Great Britain, France and Italy, by reducing the supplies both  0 maintain their forces and to feed their populationsEvery army in every field has hitherto been fully supplied and no reduction has been made on account of the submarine campaign.      On the contrary in addition to the forces which were in the field when the intensive submarine campaign commenced in the early part of 1917, it is a matter of public knowledge that there are now in France nearly two millions of American troops.     That army is the measure of the failure of the submarine.World building including American now exceeds World losses and the harvests of this year are somewhat better than those of last year.     This means that the Allies can transport and supply in France for next year&apos;s campaign, an Immensely larger armjr than they have ever commanded before, but it does not mean that there is tonnage sufficient to import as much for civilian consumption during the coming Winter as in the past.   On the contrary both the need and reward of economy are greater than ever.      America has the men and desires as much as the European Allies do that they shall come and come quickly.    But these forces would necessarily be limited if the supplies In France to maintain them and the ships to transport those supplies were insufficient.   Every pound of supplies whether of food or clothing or other imported articles which we can save here means so much more shipping to take supplies for the Armies in France and therefore so much more help towards a bigger force and early victory,If everyone in the United Kingdom alone saved only two ounces a day as compared with last year!s consumption, this saving alone would enable 200,000 additional troops to be sent to France and maintained there.3 It
It is well that the public, should, In considering the sacrifices they are asked to make, remember those which Germany has berne for several years.   In Germany even the nominal allowance of bread is only 2f pounds a week, their allowance of bacon and meat together amounts to 9 ounces a week, their allow-ance   of fat is between 2 and 2% ounces per week.The Government feel that they can appeal with confidence to the public both to make every porsible voluntary reduction in consumption and to accept cheerfully such restrictions as may from time be necessary, in order that by a concentration of the whole national and Allied eff*5t for a few months victory may be both rapid and decisive.Note      In the above statement of Building and losses it has been thought best to include information as to the losses and building of all the main maritime countries including neutrals, enemy powers alone being excluded; and to make the statement in terms of deadweight tonnage, in order to give a closer indication of cargo carrying capacity than gross tonnage does.      In view of the difficulty cf obtaining up-to-date Information as to new building in certain neutral countries, and of ascertaining the exact deadweight tonnage fcf certain classes of vessels, the information may sometimes be somewhat less exact thnn if it were confined to Allied countries and stated in terms of grcss tonnageD   The margin cf possible inaccuracy is,- however, small and not sufficiant, in the opinion of the Council, to outweigh the advantages of this form of statement.
