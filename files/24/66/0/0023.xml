:,to&apos;&apos; (i, j tftf^   ifpj)   ,jQ[illL22.^:lI!.;;nt &apos;sibe PropertyFORTNIGHTLY REPORT onn  ^* rT    pacifism and REVOLUTIONARY organisations01 UiiC I &apos;IN THK UNITI3D KINGDOMiThere is already evidence, that a Ministerial statement on the German Peace Offer cannot safely be delayed until the meeting of Parliament.   Even persons who have never held Paoifist views are beginning to question whether the German&apos;Offer should not at once be accepted.That there- is still a slump in Pacifist meetings and open propaganda is due to the decision of the Independent Labour Party to say and, do nothing which may prejudice the chances of their candidates for the General Election, on .which they are countirg.   Mr. E. D. Morel has been nominated by the Independent Labour . &apos; Party as candidate for Motherwell, near Glasgow,   They hope to secure a suffic-iently large number of seats to make themselves % strong force-in the House of Commons, and as soon as the Election is over they ivtend to adopt militant tactics in every part of England.   Though the Independent Labour Party is paci-fist to ft man, we have had the extraordinary spectacle at Leicester, during the Keir Bardie celebrations, of the. principal Organiser, Councillor Murby, declar-iijg, with apparent pride, that no less than four hundred local members &apos;of the Independent Labour Party were then fighting in the trenches, whilst &quot;our * youngest British Colonel&quot; was also an Independent Labour P^rty man.   They admit that they .&quot;aave had a bad time lately with the general public, but they count on being able to say that, the rejection of the Austrian Peace tffe^s proves that,. . the War is, as they have always said, purely capitalistic.   Their lack of influence at the moment is shown by the poor attendance at their great demonstra-tion at S,u. Martinfs Hall, Liverpool, on Sunday, the 29th&quot;September, as a&apos;-&apos; memorial to the late. Mr. &apos; Keir Bardie.    Though this meeting was to be the principal Independent Labour Party gathering of the year, and was widely advertised, only six hundred persons&apos;attended it, but what they lacked in numbers they made up in the ferocity of their   speeches.   Mrs. Bamber, who haar been carrying on propaganda among working women for the last two or three yeavs, said she did not believe in this War, but she did believe in the War which was vocome : as soon as this one was ended, and that that would be a bloodier War than th$&apos;-:-,,.,&quot;.&apos;-/; \//.&apos;--..:.-\. - ...  &apos;   t:War in France.   Miss Sylvia Pankhurst described herself as a Bolshevik, and sa,id, .&apos;, . ,   &apos;&apos; ; -that she was getting letters from Russia, through America, by hand, which showedthat the Bolshevik Government was doing splendidly in spite of all that thenewspapers said to the contrary.   She proposes to circulate one of these.letters.tjgive below come particulars of the Bolshevik movement in this country,My Lancashire correspondent notes that everyone in Lancashire was against the Railway Strike and condemned the strikers, not because they wanted more money, but because their action hampered the prosecution of the War.   lie is also im-pressed with the&apos; great value of Mr. Gompers&apos; speeches which, he says, have acted as a tonic to the men.&quot;My Midland correspondent thinks that if the General Eleotion is. postponed, the Pacifists vfill begin a very violent propaganda on the Peace movement without
delay.On the whole, the Independent Labour Party Meetings have been peaceful, though not very largely attended, but at Mountain Ash, Glamorganshire, a body of discharged soldiers entered the Hall and broke up the Meeting.There is a great deal of talk in Glasgow about the end of the War, and the people do not seem to be much elated by the present victories.   All they seem to care about is the Bafe return of their own relations.   My correspondent thinks that the&apos;publication of German outrages is not now doing much good, for they disturb the people who have relations as prisoners in the hands of the Germans, and these people do not care how Peace ooroes as long as they can get these priconers free.&apos; As regards the&apos; present -temper of the average working engineer, it is perhaps worth quoting a paragraph from a letter recently reoeived from one of themj-&quot;It is often said at Independent Labour Party meetings and in the works that the Prince of, Wales will never reign.   Believe me, there is. J-rio desire of the workers to help Germany.   They all say Germany must be beaten first.   Full confidence is given to Uoyd George during the war.., The workers don t want to be bothered with elections, etc.   They say &apos;win the War first , but in the meantime,we will organize to have a strong voice in matters afterwards.   All the present ferment is education as a &apos; means to an end .   -There is a growing agitation in Glasgow and in Independent Labour Party circles for the release of John McLean,    There is also a growing disposition in extremist circles to drag Into every meeting the case of Tom Mooney, a man lying under sentence of death in America for a bomb outrage in connection with the Industrial Workers of the 7*rorld.DISCHARGED SOLDIERS. &apos;\. .... ,My Sheffield correspondent says that discharged soldiers are becoming very dissatisfied because their pensions are affected if they work excess overtime.. Their bitterness on this point is having a bad effect upon civilians.   The Independent Labour Party are working on this discontent, and distorting the     . . facts, and the scldiers are saying that they will demand redress as.soon as the War is over.The Pacifists in Glasgow are hoping to capture the Glasgow Federation of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers for the Independent Labour Party. &apos;They are working upon the agitation about house rents and the dissatisfaction regarding , the allowance for soldiers&apos; dependants.THE UNION, OF DEMOCRATIC CONTROLThis Society has been employing Mr. Joseph King,.M.P., on a tour ,of the. West Riding towns.   He has carefully tuned his speeches&apos;to the note least likely to antagonize voters at the next General Election-   At Huddersfield, on the 1st October, he spoke of &quot;the splendid courage, endurance, discipline, and self saorifice of our soldiers&quot;, but victories in the field were not what he was fighting for.   They left many of the problems of the wrrld&apos;s peace unsolved, such as Ireland and Russia.    &quot;Russia must not be robbed of her Revolution.   If she were, it would be an outstanding disgrace in these years of disgrace&quot;.    At
&apos;Norwanton, on the 2nd, Mr. King was good enough to express approval of President Wilson and Mr. Balfour in connection with the League of nations.THE REGENT.RAILWAY STRIKE.Some information lias now come to hand as to how the Railway strike was organized,   On the morning of Friday, September 20th,&apos; Frank Field,&apos; a signalman, and W, J, Ewing, relief signalman, at Llantrissant Station, both extreme : Socialists, were seen in conversation with&apos; the yard-men of the station. Field called a Strike Meeting for 1 p.m., and a Resolution was passed to strike at 2 p.m.   The strike soon spread to the guards, signalmen, and shunters on the Ely Valley,&apos; Great Western Railway.   At 10 a.m. the next day a Meeting was held at Pontyclun, when Field climbed on to the platform and tried to secure an adverse vote to the resolution to resume work.    He said that they thought that as soon as they struck, the Telegraph Offices would be&apos;closed to them, but on finding that this was not the case, telegrams were&apos;sent to several centres, calling for support.   Steps are now being taken to examine these telegrams, some of which are said to have been in code.   I have a list of the principal strike agitators, with which I need&apos; not burden this report.    A good many undercurrents were at work in South Wales,, but my correspondents, think that the Independent Labour Party, which has branches at Cardiff, Newport, Pontypridd, and Abertillery, was responsible for the insidious propaganda which had attended the younger element among the railwaymen.Bromley appears to have been playing a double part.   Publicly he was against the strike, but privately he is said, on good,authority, to have been encouraging the men to stand firm.   There were no fewer than three Strike Committees working independently in Cardiff, and the whole business has caused disruption between the National Union of Railwaymen, the-Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and Firemen.    The promoters of the strike are rather alarmed at the prospect of a Government enquiry, and while some of the men threaten to cease work, others openly confess that, they would welcome an investigation.ENGLISH BOLSHEVIKS. * ..    &apos;During the past fortnight an organisation oalling itself &quot;The People&apos;s Russian Information Bureau&quot; has been established, with W. F.&apos; Watson, one of the men who was prosecuted for the May, strikes last year, as President, T. 0. Hollowell as Secretary, and Miss Sylvia Pankhurst as Treasurer.   It professes to,furnish correct information as to the course of events in Russia, and: It has issued leaflets containing letters alleged to have, been received from Russia without pas sing through the Censorship.    A Bearoh of Hollptyel;l&apos;s premises- was made ,on the 3rd Ootober, and one of the leaflets was shown to him, but he declined to take responsibility for this, and said that he was only distributing it at the request of Miss Sylvia Pankhurst.  The question of a raid upon her premises is now being considered.   Among the papers seiaed was a typewritten document purporting to be signed by Captain Jaques Sadoui, of the French Military Mission at LIoscow, and to be addressed, to the Pacifist, Romain Rolland.    This and other documents disolosed the real object of the &quot;Information Bureau&quot;, which is to work up an agitation against the Allied Intervention in Russia, as being inimical to the Russian Revolution.    There was evidence that a good many people were sending subscriptions to the Bureau,
Hollowell ia a young engine fitter employed by the Qarracq Company, andhis wife has stated that since he took up with Revolutionary Labour matters heis negleoting his home.. This is characteristic of many of these agitators.The term &quot;Bolshevik&quot; seems to have a curious fascination for the . extreme Revolutionaries in England.   At the Keir Hardie Meeting at Liver-pool, one of the&apos; speakers said that there were six avowed Bolsheviks on the platform, and some of the leaders of the British Socialist Party would certainly apply the title to their own political views.   One of the Russian Bolshevik principles w;hioh has most attraoted them is the standard wage of not more than 700 roubles a month and not less than 500 roubles (at pre-War rates,  74. 7s. 6d. and  53., 2a. 6d.),.,  No-one may draw two salaries, and if a second employment is undertaken, it must be voluntary.   Lenin is stated to be drawing&apos;a standard wage ,of 500 roubles a month, with lodgings.    Miss Sylvia Pankhurst referred with pleasure to the case of an Editor who was drawing 200 roubles a month less than his oompositors.   The second attractive principle is that only factory workers and peasants, who do not hire other men aad women to whrk for them, can be doctors for the Soviets.   The British Pocialist Party draws most, of, its funds from well-to-do middle class sympath-izers in England, but there is very strong reason for belief-that Litvinoff&apos;. has financed Bolshevik agitation in this country with Russian funds.   His banking account has been investigated, and it was found that shortly before he left, he drew out a considerable sum in notes.    A garden party was given in his honour at the private house of Mr&apos;.&apos; Alexander, the Treasurer of the British Socialist Farty, shortly before his embarkation.   Speeches were made, in which Litvinoff assured them that the Bolshevik regime  was firmly seated, and he seized upon the&apos; opportunity for making a violent attack upon Kerensky. It was noticed, however, that there was a very Jong t!te-a-te\e conversation between Litvinoff and Fairchild, who is Editor of &quot;The Call&quot;, and in comment-ing on.this, Mr. Alexander said that Fairchild would not refuse money if it were offered to him, but he is cunning enough to accept it in such a way that it could not be brought&apos;home to him.   He added that at the moment the official funds of the British Socialist Party were only  30, but that Mr. Roden Buxton and Mr. Allbright, of Birmingham,, were always good for  150 when it was wanted.. Among the grotesque figures that are congregating under, the Bolshevik flag are Arthur Field and Marina duke Pickthall, who has lately founded the East and West Club, which is intended to be a Socialist Club for Orientals. Both these men are pro-Turk and anti-British,   With&apos; them is an Indian named : Saklatwala, who calls himself &quot;the representative of the Independent Labour Party,   He has been making Violent speeches against Mr. Montagu &quot;and the new Indian scheme.   Now Fieldvis a1 close friend of Arnall, lately convicted of  ; making speeches against the French, and Carmichsel.. who organized the Police&apos; Strike.   These men work in different spheres, but support each other closely&apos; in the Committees to which they jointly&apos; belong,   They do not work with the ! Socialists who are engaged on eoonomic propaganda. ;It may be well to give, here some particulars about Carmichael, who is \ likely to come rather prominently to the front during the next few months.   He was formerly active in the British Socialist Party, then known as the Social Demooratio Federation, at Battersea, where he stood against Mr. John Burns.
5.9 7After losing the election he kept rather quiet until the outbreak, of War. Just before the War he get himself into a mess by using money which did not belong to him, and it is believed that Field then came to his assistance. He has now come to the front as Secretary to the London Trades Council, which was not at all an important body until he took it in hand.   Trades Councils are traditionally not fighting bodies, and tfreir funds are limited to the small amount required for printing, in connection with Parliamentary nominations.   Under Carmichael, the London Trades Council has been made a convenient cover for fomenting Labour unrest.   Having now brought off the organization of the Police for strike1purposes, he has turned his attention to the London milkmen, who are very dissatisfied.   He is in touch also with the Electrical Trades Union&apos;,&quot; Who will almost certainly come out within the next few months, but Carmichael&apos;s activities are all . underground, and it is very unlikely that evidence will be forthcoming.on. which he canbe* prosecuted.&apos; f :- To show how widely Bolshevism is beginning to spread, I may cite thecase of Harold Gwyer, a tool turner employed at the National AircraftFactory, Waddon, near Croydon, who lives at 66, Laitwood Road., Balham.   A  -letter dated &quot;the 30th July, 1918, addressed by this mart to &quot;an airman&apos;&apos;atEast church, ;named Phillip Setter, contained the following&apos;passages:-&quot;Sorry youVe found such an utter lack of class-consciousness on Sheppey.   But, much as&quot; I&apos;dislike to say it,. I believe there is to . be found a vast expanse of what you term ^uhtilled ground &quot;all about the country, and&apos;particularly in the Forces ,He goes on to urge: his correspondetrt to &quot;&apos;get in with, a- few. simple truths.............   Th&apos;e&apos;acobmpahying pamphlets may assist you in. doing p little&apos; propaganda, but you must do it quietly for, your own sake.   Moreover, thecopy&apos; of &apos;HThe Call&quot; herewith was&apos; suppressed by .-.our Prussians - the Bolshevikappeal was really too democratic -for we democratic Britons. ..-..:.&apos;...,......

Carmichael and the Constables who have organized the Union appear to be determined to try conclusions once more.   They are probably not intelligent enough to realize that if they strike again they will have the whole body of public opinion against them, with the exception of such revolutionary organizations as may hope.to profit by civil disorder.   It is doubtful whether during the &apos; War they will succeed in bringing out any other Union in sympathy with them, though there would; probably be a sympathetic strike among the omnibus and tram conductors in, London.   Revolutionary agi&quot;1 Hors who look ahead .would doubtless prefer,to. keep Police discontent simmering..until what they regard1   as the right moment&apos;arrives5   it would hot suit their book to bring &quot;them out prematurely and. perhaps see tho principal agitators dismissed from the Fortre and called to the Colours.   But the agitators of the Police Union are not far-seeing, and they .are now attempting, as was foreseen, to interfere with discipline, and they may repeat their old tactics of putting up a claim for larger pay. In order-to bring in the quieter men who do not favour striking..In this connection, it is worth, noting that in Adelaide, South: Australia, where the Police could not be depended upon, the civil population has taken. . the/matter into its own hands, and has formed a very large volunteer vigilant., organization-,-whf are prepared to come out and maintain order in the streets .. in the event of a Police Strike.MORALE IN FRANCE. - - . ,    - -   &apos; &apos;&quot;.  &apos;The victories in Palestine, the capitulation,in.Bulgaria,/ and the recent successes in the West have all contributed to raise morale, both military and civilian, to the highest point yet reached,&apos; and minor grievances and causes of unrest have fallen into the background&apos;.    The successes are attributed every-where to the unity of command, and this flatters, the. ,self-esteem of the French. Now that difficult negotiations are drawing, near, there, is &apos;a general hope that there will be a &quot;Versailles diplomatique&quot; to co-ordinate the claims of the Allies and to avoid friction.There, is a good deal of. Labour unrest, ,but thpre is no evidence of Pacifism or Tdefaitisme\ behind it.    The Syndicalist leaders, are&apos;exploiting the high prices, for political purposes, but the continued successes in the field are neutralizing their efforts.    Lieutenant Chardonnal, the Labour Controller at Havre, has been blamed for reluctance to take action against Labour agitators and for a tendency to go back upon aotion when he has taken it, but this is explained by the fact that he was formerly himself a workman of
7.98-militant views.Favourable reports are being received fMom all parts respecting the spirit of the 1980 class, who were called up amid scenes of gaiety, cheerfulness, and even enthusiasm, but the proportion of the new class who wore found to be fit for scrvioo is low.    In Dieppe, for instance, it reached only about 30 per cent.   The rest were &apos;ajourncV.   It must not be forgotten, however, that many of the best recruits of this ola38 volunteered before they were called up.The French Colonial troops, owing partly&apos;to their unkempt appearanceand their increasing tendency to loot private property, are not in favourwith the French population in the South, They are unfavourably contrasted with our Cape Coloured labour troops.In the South of France there is some dismay at the spread of the Spanish influenza, and rumours have been circulated of cases of plague in Marseilles.Monsieur Lotiguet returned to Paris in a very bad temper with the British whom he met at the Inter-Allied Conference, and he is now under Police supervision by the Surete Generale, who think that he may be likely to ioznent.disorder.,  Though there is he big cloud on the politioal. horizon, it has been noticed that at ,the Meeting of the &quot;Conseil .General.des -Bouohes-du-Rhcne&quot;, at Finisterre,. a vote-of confidence in Monsieur Clemenceau waB defeated,. though the other resolutions of the day which were of a patriotic nature were passed.It is a matter for great regret that American units arriving at Havre during September are showing very marked antipathy towards the British.. In some cases, the feeling between the soldiers and. the British crews of transports led to free fights, in which the American,Officers had to intervene.   The explanation is said to be the bad quality and in-suffioiency of the food supplied on board British transports, and the same complaint is made against the food supplied at the Winchester Camp.   The suggestion is made that the responsibility for cooking and catering might be transferred to the Americans.   That something of this kind should be done seems neoessary if a state of rancour between the American and British troops in the field is to be avoided.There appears to be considerable dissatisfaction with the present Belgian Government in financial and industrial Belgian ciroles, who con-sider the Government incapable of dealing with reconstruction problems after the War.There is reported to be an improvement in the feeling of the Frenoh civilian population towards the Allied troops, with the exception of the Portuguese, who appear to be generally unpopular.   Frenoh troops home on leave are &apos;fraternizing more readily with the British troops since the introduction of the system of mixing French and British Divisions.
Though the morale of the British troops continues to be very high, somegrumbling has been heard on the following points1.    The recent ruling on the granting of Decorations, which is regarded as having oome too late, though it is good in Itself;2.    The slowness of leave in some of the units, and particularly in dealing with applications for special leave.   The men sometimes arrive home too late for the event for which the special Leave was granted;3.    The strikes in England.   Though the general, view is that workmen, and particularly the railway workers, are not playing the game, there is a tendency to blame the authorities rather than the man, on the somewhat illogical ground that if the matter had been better handled, the strikers v/ould not have come out.TALY.The situation regarding deserters in Sicily has become serious.    The Minister of the Interior has had to send down an Inspector with six hundred Cavalry to support him, and the deserters are being rounded up.   At Girgenti, in one day 588 deserters were rounded up after some fighting, and in another place armed deserters barricaded themselves in a house and fought for six hours.    There have been several Military executions, and gangs of men have been seen going to the Front in chains.   The prevalence of Sicilians&apos; desertions is not due to cowardice or pacifism, but is purely political.    The Sicilians say that the Northern Italians receive preferential treatment regarding leave and easy billets in the rear.    The local sympathy is entirely with the deserters.There is some indignation against the attacks upon Baron Sonnino, which have been appearing in &quot;New Europe&quot;, and &quot;II Piccolo&quot; has been taking up the cudgels for him.On the night of the 14th August, an attempt was made to blow up the powder factory at Randi, near Lugo, but an explosion was averted by a soldier who discovered and removed a bomb weighing 5,600 lbs.,&apos;   The bomb appeared to be the work of an amateur.B.
