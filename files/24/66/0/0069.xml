If what is already known to v you is repeated you will, I know, exouse it if it makes tho minor points more intolligiblooWhen our original objective had to be cancelled or postponed, it became apparent thai there was plenty to engage our activities in Persia.   Ever since the war started, and doubtless for some timo previously, it had been a hot-bed of hostile intrigue.    Agents, arms, ammunition, military in-structors, and gold, were poured into tho country, ,. The tribesmen were armed and organised against us, and the efforts and aspirations of the Extreme Democrats, - &quot;Persia for the Persians11 representing their war-ory though not their aotions, -were, utilised to the utmost against the Allies,    The Russian d6ba*olo was as&apos; strong in its effect on their troops here as anywhere also.    Discipline disappeared, officers wo-ra mur-dercd, stores wore looted, and forty to fifty thousand de-moralised, soldiers straggled through the country tawards tho Oaspian and their homes.    Their behaviour en route was atrocious.    Robbery, rapine, and murder marked, their traok,, leaving to us, as their Allies, a legacy of hate and horror in the minds, of most Persians,,    There had been two years of bad harvests through drought amounting to famine, or, at all events, groat soaroity,    Tho Turks, too, had Bwayod backwards and forwards over this, road, and an immense belt of country on eaoh side.    They were not quite so bad as the Russians, but this is the bost that can be said about thorn.   The melting snows made the road in tho Spring well nigh impassable, and    * only a very few of our party of Officers and H,C,0&apos;,,s, were able to get through to Hamadan before hay - June.    All the way up from rail-head wo passed through ruined villages, -the very roof-rafters had disappeared, probably; half tho. normal population wore dead, and. many of the remainder died of star-vat ion by the road-side.    Cannibalism was rampart, and.some of us actually witnessed a mother and daughter being stoned to death, undor Moslem law, for this crime.   We heard of hundreds of other instances.    Grain was forty to fifty times, the nor-raal price, and the wealthy Persian land-owners, Jows and brokers were hoarding what there was of it for profiteering,    Dogs&apos; wero devouring corpses on the roads and in the streets, and, in short, tho most ghastly.Old Testament records of tho days of &quot;soaroity and a famine in. the land&quot; were reproduced, or oxoced-ed, before our.eyes.Tho
9 *) p w 6 0The Persian Government did not mobilise a soldier to preserve neutrality, nor lift a finger tfc help the starving population.     It, therefore, beoame necessary for us to take action not only against enemy action and intrigues in the country, but also, following British instinots of humanity, to help the perishing,     How true it is that one never loses one^ way by keeping on a straight track!     Both the above objects were - I-will not soy achieved altogether, - but certainly profoundly and satisfactorily influenced by 6ur policy.   Here we were, a mere handful-, without troops, surrounded by an angry, hostilej starving population with circumstances demand-ing that we must make gond our country1s position.   It was done, in short, by Famine Relief Measures.     It would take tec long to recount how seed-wheat was somehow got through (and sown under supervision) through terrible roads infested by hostile Kurdish tribes - road-robbers by profession from time immemorial.   How profiteers and hoarders wore compelled to disgorge without armed strength in a country where all are armed to the teeth.     How soup-kitchens were started without visible supplies of food, - and, when started, the starving folk were prevented from trampling eaoh other to death;   how relief works wore instituted where, at first, many who camo nominally &quot;to work&quot; were found to be only able to die;   how our limited personnel of officers and 11.0.0*8, specially selected as they were for a. strenuous fighting Jot as we thought, proved themselves humanitarians, philanthropises and organisers of the highest order, and stoically endured being sniped at by the Democrats and the hourly risk of assassination.-   I cannot explain now but must briefly Say that by the united efforts of &apos;Dunsterf^rce&apos;, a few U.S*missionaries, the Imperial Bank of Persia, ndarly one-third of the population of Ramadan (and some other towns) were rationed and saved from death. (Fortunately a bountiful harvest is just being reaped).Politically it will suffice to say that amongst a people, proverbially noted for ingratitude, a &quot;democrat&quot; cannot now raise his voice against the British without being mobbed, and perhaps killed, by the populace.   Best of all, innumerable offers of large bodies of armed levies, to assist us against the Turk, are coming in, and were one writing for the &apos;yellow press1 it,would be fitting to have the headlines: &quot;The Romanoe of War&quot;I     &quot;Persia conquered by a soup-ladle&quot;.As you know, we are now in greater strength, and using more lethal weapons and further afield.     The TurkeyGerman enemy is organising and pushing a, formidable thrust S.05., on the line Batoum-Tabriz as centre, with India as its objective, and making.the&apos;Caspian a Hun-lake, as the Black Sea now is,&apos;, and endeavouring  ..to. influence the Tartars, Persians, Afghans, and other Islamic peoples into a holy war against the British Infidel 1     Our counter-measures must be well-known to you in principle and details are not discussable, nor would it be soldierlike to go into the many difficulties to bo overcome. These are not lessened by the disturbed, distracted&quot; state of Persian Politics and affairs, nor by the presence of a vacillating British Minister at Teheran, who alternates between &quot;brave words&quot; and S.O.S. messages.     Doubtless,, something very much more definite will havo happened before this letter reaches you;   but those notes nay possibly help you to a truer appreciation of tho situation,&quot;
