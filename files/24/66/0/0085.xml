hi,entIMPORTATION OF ONIONS FROM SPAINMEMORANDUM BY THE FOODOONTROLLEROwing to&quot;, the comparative failure of this year&apos;s home onion crop, the small Spanish crop, and the insuperable difficulties in the.way of securing sufficient tonnage to import other foreign onion crops, it has become necessary to control tho prices of both homo grown and imported onions.The principal source uf supply abroad is Spain, which exported about 70,000 tons to this country- last season, and Spain under the commercial agreement with the United Kingdom is entitled to send to the United Kingdom an unlimited quantity.   Tho Spanish Onion crop is not so largo as last yeart   The total exportable surplus was estimated at about 76,000&apos;tone, of.which quantity 11,000 tons have already been shipped either to this country, to the Allied Forces, or Scandinavia, leaving available for export from now onwards 64^000 tons only.   The combined demands of the British, French and American Armies in France amount to somo 63,000 tons during the 7 months which correspond with tho Spanish Onion Season,   It is possible that this demand may be somewhat reduced by an arrangement with the French Government, whereby the 10^000 tons which they desire to export to this country may be used for French Troops with a corresponding reduction in their requisition from Spain.In any case, it is clear that at least five sevenths of the Spanish Exportable surplus will be demanded (on the present basis of the Onion ration to the Army) for the British Army and the Allies, and in order to steady prices, I consider it desirable that the whole of the exportable surplus should be purchased through a single agency, the final allocation as between the Allied Forces and the civilian population of this Country, being reserved for settlement by mutual agreement..   It is proposed that the purchase should be made through the Allied Purchasing Bureau at Madrid, through Captain Williams of the Special Purchase Department of the War Office and to this tho War Office has agreed.The Foreign Office see no objection to this course, provided &apos; that the spirit as well as the letter of the Special Agreement is . observed, and that the price arranged is sufficient to allow a reasonable profit to the Spanish growers.   The Treasury desire to see private purchases stopped in view of their effect upon the Exchange, and I accordingly ask for the sanction of the War Cabinet to the prohibition of the import of onions except under licence.An Order controlling the price of imported onions will shortly come into force.J.R. CLYNES*Ministry of Food,15th October, 1918.
