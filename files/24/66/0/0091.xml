I asked tho Irish Recruiting Council to give me their views on conscription.   They inform mo&apos;that their individual views differ, but that this memorandum sots out a compromise at which they have arrived.The Government should, upon the 16th October, issue the Order in Council.The Government should, prior to the issue of the Order, make a statement to the following effcot:-1*   That the Order in Council is being made in accordance with the undertaking of the Lord Lieutenant.II.   While the Order is being issued, that its actual enforcement in any area will be postponed until the 1st December on the grounds:-(a) Though Lord Frenches Proclamation was issued 3,6.18,no steps were taken to organise recruiting until the form-ation-of the Council in 14.6.18.(b) That the Council was not able to get its new organisation actually working until the 12.8,18.(o) Although the number of recruits has not reached the proper standard, that a substantial number have been obtained. Moreover, there has been a vast change in public opinion effected by the operations of the Recruiting Council, and their campaign has an educative value that can be continued with advantageoIII.

The Chief Secretary will remember that cf four cardinal points assented to, three have not yet been carried cub, while a compromise was eventually reached cn the fourth0At the outset the Council endeavoured to co-operate with the Military Authorities in adjusting the then existing recruiting system to the necessities of the new Campaign0 While both parties laboured for a considerable time on this projeot, it proved impracticable.The oxirixrg scheme was then, built up by the Council in conjunction with the Ministry of National Service represented by Colonel Reid Hyde, and considering the novelty and complex-ity of the organisation, the time occupied in putting it   to-gother was not unreasonable.     At all events it represented; the whole time service of the majority of the members of tho&apos; Council.   The dominant idea of the scheme assumed that the, Council would be able to secure civilian officers to carry out the Work of propaganda assisted by local commltteeo, but in *-the condition of distrust and unrest prevailing in the country this proved practically impossiblea     It became necessary, therefore-; to organise a staff of persons who had served or wore serving in the Forces, who were either temporarily or permanently, unfit for the fighting line,   It was not easy to compile a staff selected from this class; and when selected, a very long delay, was occasioned parrying out the procedure necessary, to obtain tho sanction of.the War Office to their employment.o     Tho result was that the machine was,, started while still incomplete on the 12th August, end sanction for the officers necessary- finally to complete it was not Obtained until the middle, of September,     Tho result was unfortunate in as, much as the defective organization was unable to avail of the initial impulse which was genuine and considerale, but which died down for want of men to keep it uptThe complete organization   has therefore been in op-eration only for one month.(Signed)   T. B. Soliarfor Seo. I.R.C.11th., October, 191
