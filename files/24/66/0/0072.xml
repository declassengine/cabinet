George the Conference (hold at the Quai dJorsay on October 9th,.1918, at 6 p.m.) decidedTo refer to tho Military Representatives at Versailles, with.whom should be associated Representatives of the American, British, French and Italian Nayi.es,  the question of the liaison between the naval and military: forces cf the Allies in the forthcoming operations against Constantinople, together with the question of the command of the Allied, na&apos;al forces engaged in these operations.GENERAL di ROBIL\NT
fad IOBKERAL di ROBILAHT having declared tho &quot;Mooting-open said that . it&quot;was only late yesterday evening that he had received notice of this Meeting, together with the Terms of Reference. Previous to this, they, as Military Represontativ;:&apos;s, had not been appro-ached on this subject so that it was quite a now on&apos;1 tft thon.A fei,r minutes ago they had received from the British Section, copies of the following extracts of instructions, dated 7th October, 1918, issued to General Franchet d(EGperey:^French, British and Italian Governments are agreed to develop immediate action of Allies in Balkan Peninsula on following lines:-(a) &quot;Eastern section of Allied Army marching on Constantinople r/ill bo placed under direct command of British General, who will be under orders of French Commander-in-Chief.(b) Army marching on Constantinople will consist principally cf British troops, but will include French, Italian, Serbian and Greek troops.(o)   British troops will take part in Army operating towards the north.And to this had been added a draft Joint Resolution which read as follows :-After examining the question referred to them by the Conference of Ministers held on 9th October, 19l8, and after examining the instructions issued by the Allied Governments to the General Officer Commanding the Allied Forces in the Orient, the Permanent Military Representatives, with.:whom are associated Naval Representatives, are of opinion that :-(a) The liaison between the Naval and Military forces operating in the Eastern portion of Macedonia and- the Aegean Sea against the Ottoman Empire with a view to tho reduction.of Constanti-nople, and the opening of the Black Sea to the Allied Fleets, should be direct and of the closest nature.(b) As the Command of the Eastern section of the Allied Army marching on Constantinople has been invested by the Allied Powers in a British General, it is essential that the Allied Naval&apos; Command be likewise entrusted, so far as these operations are concerned, to a British Admiral, in order that the intimate cc-operation between the two Services referred to in paragraph (a) above may be ensured.He would at once point out that as regards the question of command there appeared to be a difference between these two documents.     In the first document it was stated that the British General would be under the orders of the French Commander-in-Chief;   whereas, in the second, document it was stated that the command of the Eastern Section of the Allied Army marching on Constantinople had been invested by the Allied Powers in a British General,     So far, this was all he knew about the case.   But since the two documents had been issued by the British Section, he would call on General Sackville-Test to place the facts before then.
- 3 -GEKSRAL SAffiVILLE-WEST asked permission in the first place to say that; he accepted at once the correction implied by His Excellency Count&apos; di Robilant in his opening statement.     It was only through a mistake in drafting that the apparent difference pointed out by His Excellency had occurred.   But this had never boon intended, and in order to make it clear, he would suggest inserting the words :&quot;who will be under the orders of the French Commander-in-chief&quot;after the words &quot;British General&quot; in paragraph (b).(Conoral di Robilant agreed).General Saokville-&apos;7^st continuing said that he would now add a few words on the subject they had been called upon to consider. ,  In hia opinion the question dealt with in the draft Joint Resolution was entirely a naval one.     It had been roferred to the Military Representatives only because the land and sea forces were to co-operate.     He proposed, therefore, to ask the Deputy First Sea Lord, Admiral Hope, to give the views of the British Admiralty,ADMIRAL HOPE held that no one would deny the justice of theproposals contained in paragraph (a] of the draft? Resolution. To get satisfaotory joint action between the Military and Naval forces, the liaison between the Commanders, must necessarily be of the closest nnturo.     Tho British General would require considerable assistance in work on the coast&apos;, carrying of stores, protection Of anchorages and also, probably, artillery assistance.     And; as the zone of the Aegean has been in the hands of the British since 191?, and since the majority of the small craft and monitors employed on this work would be those of the British Navy in the Aogean, it would be more satisfactory to the General Command-ing the land forces for all tho naval forces in the Aegean to be placed under a British Admiral, in exactly the same.way as was done during the oarlier operations against the DardanelletGENERAL di ROBILANT said that the question apparently resolved itself into one of Command.     Tho British Military Representative had agreed to a slight correction in the text of paragraph (b) of the draft Resolution and that the British General Commanding the Alliod Amy marching on Constantinople should remain under the orders of tho French Commander-in-Chief.GENERAL.BELIN wished in the first place to say a few wOrds regarding the publication of the instructions given to General Franchet I^Esperey.,     Theso instructions had been given to him (General Belin) on tho 8th October last, but purely for his own personal.and private information. He hadtherefore
0 *) 0Iv (J tjtherefore not been entitled to communicate them to hi a colleagues-.   Today they had been given out by the British Military Representative, &quot;He himself therefore disclaimed all responsibility.     According to the instructions,, it was proposed to entrust the Command of the Eastern Section of the Allied Irmy mar c hi rip: on Constantinopx.6 tc a British General,    From uiis it followed that the operations against Constantinople were not to be pureiy Naval operations, but land operations. He therefore wished to dissociate himself from the British Military Representative^ statement to the effect  hat the operation was a Naval one,     Further, the operations in Question had not yet started.    Before these could start certain objectives had to be reached.     To understand the situation fully it was necessary to see the rest of the instructions, which clearly stated that first of all General Franchet D!Esperey should make sure of his occupation of Bulgaria.     Once he felt sure that everything was safe in Bulgaria, the operations against Constantinople could take place.    It was only, then, that a portion of the Annies attributed to the French Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies in the Orient would be detached under-the British General to march in the direction of Constantinople, but always under the superior Command of General Franchet D&apos;Esperey.    Therefore it was General Franchet DfEsperey who would hold the Supreme Command until Constantinople was reached.GENERAL SACKVILLE-WEST pointed out that the question of general Franchet D^sperey^ Command did not arise.     He thought he had made this clear in suggest?!ng an amendment to that effect in paragraph (b) of the draft Joint Resolution.GENERAL BELIN continuing explained that thai was not thequestion he wished to raise.    He merely mentioned the fact so as to deduce from it who was the real Commander to direct the operations.     From what he had already said it was clear that even when the operations against Constantinople began they would be carried out by large land forces in co-operation with the other forces of the Armies in the Orient, together with Naval Forcesj&apos;   all ofmhich must act simultaneously.     Therefore it followed that the co-ordination and supervision of all these operations must devolve on the one Commander-In-Chief of the Armies in the Orient, who alone was in a position to ensure the success of the combined operations. &amp;&amp;neral Franchet D&apos;&apos;Esperey was the Commander;   he was responsible for all operations to be undertaken in that Theatre of the war and consequently they could only be directed by him.As regards the purely Naval operations, Admiral de Bon would give his views.     He would merely add that he could not help feeling that on exclusuvely Naval effort would undoubtedly meet the same difficulties as were encountered before, unless, as Marshal Foch had pointed out, both shores of the Dardanelles were first secured. Consequent-ly land operations were indispensable as a preliminary to any Naval operations,   In his opinion, the land questions with General Franchet D*Esperey as Commander-in-Chsef must be considered as the major, and the Naval operations the minor,
Further, as regards the appointment o- General Franchet D*Esperey as&apos; Commander-in-Chief of the combined operations a precedent existed&apos;.     In the case of Archangel, they had readily and   villingly agreed to the appointment of General Poole, because he was on the spot and already in Chief Command on land.   He thought that this precedent should guide than in the present case.GENERAL di ROBILANT asked permission to be allowed tocommunicate&quot; to the Meeting, certain decisions regarding the question under consideration reached by the Allied Governments with the full agreement of Marshal Focrf at a meeting&quot; recently held.   . He thought this might explain matters. .  At this Meeting, Mr. Lloyd George had stated that the United Kingdom considered it important to detach Turkey, and he had added that, when Marshal Foch had insisted on the strength of the fore.es being fully maintained, the British Government had agreed to Indian&apos; troops being sent to Macedonia.   . A large force of Indian troops had been maintained in Turkey and in addition, 500 ,,000 had^lpt ready in India as reinforcements *     The operations in Palestine had given the best results.     And they now proposed that these   operations should cease and that the troops should be detached for operations against Constantinople.     As a result of these suggestions, - the Marshal had expressed the opinion, as stated by General Belin, that the shores of the Dardanelles should be secured before any Naval operations were undertaken.     Therefore the operations they were now met together to discuss had been agreed upon. -  These operations, however   entailed -something far bigger than merely detaching&apos; as/had been suggested, a part of the troops of the existing Armies of the Orient.     It was an operation to be undertaken by large forces transferred from General Allenby:s Command, Moreover, the combined land and Naval operations were to extend far beyond the zone entrusted to General- Franchet D!Esperey.p     The two operations were therefore quite distinct :(a) Those to be carried out in Macedonia under the: direct Command of General Franchet DfEsperey,and(b) those towards Constantinople to be confided to aBritish General,
although the two must &quot;be co-ordinated, and this co-ordination was given to General Franchet D^sperey.     The reasons just given would further explain why the British Government had asked that the Naval Command should be . confided to a British Admiral.ADMIRAL de BON   said he did,not quite understand the question which had been put to them.     He would ask his colleagues to oonsider the situation in the Mediterranean.     They would there find the Allied Navies under one Commander-in-Chief who had been appointed by- agreement of the Allied Governments.     That Commander-in-Chief would be obliged to intervene in any operation in the Mediterranean. There was now to be a special operation in the Mediterranean, Consequently,, it was .for the Admf&amp;l Commanding^in-Chief to   -fix what forces should take part and who should direot the work, whilst he himself remained the Commander-in-Chief. Therefore, logically, Admiral Gauchet should receive instructions to tell off the necessary forces and to appoint the necessary Commander.     Should he think that a British Admiral ought to take Command, no-one could gainsay that. Should he, on the other hand, think differently, he would merely be exercising his rightful powers.     The Allies had a wording organisation.     It should therefore be allowed to function.     He saw &quot;mo reason for breaking up the existing organisation and substituting a new one.     They had certainly been told that a special operation had to be undertaken.     The Allies were about to attempt to take Constantinople and. the assistance of the Navy was asked for. He fully agreed that it was only by combined land operations on the two sides of the Straits that success could be achieved.Aa regards the. Naval effort, two separate operations were involved.     The principal operation, which would bring into action the main body of the Naval forces: that is to say, at the critical moment battleships would come into playt At the present moment they had in the Aegean an Inter&quot; Allied squadron Commanded by a French Admiral.     Therefore when the moment for co-operation arrived, the necessary instructions would be given to him.     The Naval action, therefore, was quite clear.     So was the co-operation of land and naval forces, since the land Cammander could not give instructions to the Commander of the Naval forces.Concurrently with the principal operations which affected the main Naval forces, there existed for minor Operations a minor Command which dealt with all subsidiary Naval matters.     This Command was already held by a British Officer, who only came under the instruction of the Admiral Commanding-5nChief when big operations had to be undertaken.     Between the two there waa complete co-operation.     But the minor operations
themselves could not take place without the cogniz-ance of the Admiral Commanding-inChief.     Now, such an organisation, being in existence, why change it ? An Intimate liaison between the British Land Commander and the British Maritime Commander in the Aegean already existed.   But when bigger forces were to be .   brought into play the present organisation would come into force.     That is to say, Naval action against the Straits would depend altogether on land operations,- and the Naval forces could only exercise their full function when the Straits had been forced and the Navy had reached the Black Sea in order to reduce the enemy Fleet.     Was that a reason for a change of organisation at present ?   He thought not. They now. possessed an organisation which offered all possible guarantees and he could see no reasons for s    a change.     In any case he was strongly of opinion that this was not a question on which the Committee could express an opinion.     It was a matter which belonged to the Governments and the Military Representatives had no right to interfere in the matter.GENERAL di ROBILANT explained that Admiral de Bon&apos;s state-ment that the present Naval Command in the Mediter-ranean had been laid down by the Governments and could only be altered by the Governments was quite true.    But he would invite the Admiral&apos;s attention to the-fact that the Governments themselves had asked them to give their views as regards the question of the Command of the Allied Naval forces to be en-gaged in the forthcoming operations against Constant-inople.     Therefore since they had been asked to give their views they must do so.     He would now ask Admiral Hope to reply to Admiral de Bon.ADMIRAL de BON  whilst admitting the justice of Generaldi Robilanfs views, held that they were called u-jwn to give a military view and not a diplomatic view.   He ought, perhaps, to have said that the question covered two views, a military view and a diplomatic view, and he considered that the Meeting should confine itself to the former aspect of the case.ADMIRAL HOPE expressed his agreement with Admiral de Bon.    But there was no idea of disturbing the present arrangements in the Mediterranean. The only proposal was that the Naval forces to co-operate with the Land forces should be com-manded by a British Admiral, exactly in the same way as Admiral Robeck had held command during the earlier operations.      -ADMIRAL de BON
ADMIRAL do BON   paid that his reply to that proposal was that the conditions now vert not the came u3 existed at the time of the Dardanelles operations.   The   latter had been started by the British and the forces&apos; were chiefly composed of British elements.   At that date nothing existed in the way of an Allied Command.   At the present moment an organisation did exist which was capable cf acting in any part of the Mcditer-&apos; rancan.   Therefore, if it ms necessary to create an organiea-tionin those days, he was no necessity for&apos; creating a new organisation now&apos;to replace an existing one.   In a word to sum up *- at the top they already had an Allied Naval Commander.&quot;in-Chief who was in daily contact with the Commander-in-Chief of; the Allied Land Forces (General Franchet DfEsperey).   Lower down, as regards the daily minor operations the same&apos; intimate liaison already cxioted.between the British General Commanding the land forces and the British Naval, Commander.   Therefore, as regurds liaison, all that was 1 required already existed.   Consequently from a military point of view they could not get any closer contact than existed -at the present moment.   -Finally,, the Admiral Commanding-ih-Chief hue his responsibilities and if he considered any improvements necessary, it was for him to suggest them.ADMIRAL HOPE asked permission to communicate to the Meeting the . &quot;^following telegram which he had just recoiled from the British Admiralty :---&apos;&quot;Possibility of rapid developments in Eastern Mediterranean has made it necessary for me to direct Admiral Calthorpo to proceed to Aegean and it is probable that his Flag will ;shortly be shifted to one of the battleships.    In these &quot;circumstances, and as Aegean is a British zone, it is assumed any orders for major operations in those waters will now bo cemmuni-cated by.Admiral Gauchet direct to Admiral Caithrrpe who would, for 3uch major operations take, command of the Allied Aeg-an Squadron,   As regards minor operations it is proposed that Admiral Oalthorpo should keep Admiral Gauchet informed of any action taken by him as was done formerly and that generally speaking he should be in the same relation to Admiral Gauohot as were Admirals de Robeck and Thursby.&quot;ADMIRAL de BON,(after perusing the telegram), said that the :, &apos; &apos; telegram in question merely asked his advice and did not communicate a decision taken.   The fact remained that they-were faced with the&apos;following situation.. They now. had in the Mediterranean an Admiral Commanding-in-Chief and if any operations- were to be undertaken it was obviously for him to-decide what forces should be employed and who should Command them.ADMIRAL HOPE   enquired whether it would meet Admiral de Bon&apos;e views if the words :&quot;under the orders of the Allied Naval Commander-&apos; in-Chief&quot;&quot;were added to paragraph (b) of the draft Joint Resolution.ADMIRAL de BON   replied that this did not satisfy him as the !      choice of t*u Officer must remain with Admiral Gauchet.
^9 0-&amp; d 0&quot;1AL SACKVILLE-WEST   pointed cut that the Governments had not left  he aelecticTn of the General to the Commander-in* Chief of the Armies in the Orient.   They had designed him.     Con-sequent ly tho same procedure might perhaps &quot;be followed in the ftuse of the Naval Commander,GENERAL BLISS   wished tto thank his colleagues for asking him &quot;To oe present at this important discussion.   The political and diplomatic situation Of his country in respect to this question, denied him the right of making any official statement.     His Government would consider these operations with sympathy and would hope that their aotion in other theatres would help on their suooeas *.    If his colleague&apos;! would like hie opinion as an outsider, he thought the question was one whioh must eventually besettled by the three Governments.   In the orders sent tw the .C emmander-in-Chi of of the Armies in&apos; the orient tho Governments had given decisions concerning oertain operations,. and even&apos; certain details.   They had a Commander-in-Shief in general charge but they told him what certain parts cf his forces wc.ro to do, and they also told him who was to be placed in charge of them..      A3 regards the seoond matter it seemed to him that if the objection was not to the -appointment of a British officer,  the solution should be on   &apos; the aarno lines as applied to the land operations.   It might be recommended that the Commander-in-Chief should designate one cf the Allies to take command in that ^particular theatre.ADMIRAL GRASS! said that his view of the matter was simply that he agreed&quot;vdth Admiral de Bon.     F&apos;qr the operations in the Straits,, special forces would have to be constituted and all fleets would be asked to co-operate;.     Italy would no doubt be asked to detach certain of its naval forces for the purpose, and these would certainly be placed at the disposal of the Admiral Oonmanding-in-Chief.ADMIRAL HOPE p.r* p- sod that paragraph (b) --f the draft Resolution should read as follows(b) As the Command of the Eastern section of theAllied Army marching on Constantinople has been placed by the Allied Powers under the direct command of a British General, who will be under the orders of the French Commander-in-Chief, it is essential that the Allied Naval Command be likewise entrusted, so far as these operations in the Aegean are concerned to a British \dmiral uncer the orders of the Allied Naval Commander-in-Chief, in order that the intimate co-op-- ration betvoen the two Services referred to in paragraph (a) above may be ensured.In other words,  the some organisation should be applied to the Naval operations a3 had been sanctioned for the land operations.    They would therefore have on land a British General under a French&apos;Commandor-in-Chiof;     for the sea operations, a British Admiral under the Admiral Cowmanding-in- Chief. .ADMIRAL do BON said he could not aocop;t this proposal.   They-   now had a Naval force under a Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean.   Certain operations head to bo undertaken... It was therefore for the Admiral Commanding-in-Chief to nominate the commander of these operations.     No other alterna-tive appeared to him to be pes ;iblc.   should the Admiral Commanding-in-Chi of himself, for instance, wish to take charge of the-jo operations, was he to be prevented from doing so ?GENERAL BELIN
GENERAL BELIN said he wished to take the liberty of asking the Meeting to confine themselves solely to the questions which had been referred to them.   They had merely been staked; First, whether the liaison between the Naval and Military forces operating in the Eastern portion of Macedonia and the Aegean&apos; Sea against tho Ottoman Empire should be direct and of the closest nature.To this question there was, in his opinion, only one possible answer, namely, that such a liaison was indispensable.Secondly, they were asked whether it was essential that the Allied Naval command should be entrusted to a Britioh Admiral,To this he would/reply that the Command must belong to the Admiral Commanding-;! n-^Chief the Allied forces in  -the Mediterranean, who had boon nominated by the Allied Governments.In his opinion the two questions were very clear and it was not necessary to travel outside the strict limits of their reference,AMIRAL HOJPE explained that the proposal which ho had put forward placed the Naval situation on exactly the same footing as the Governments had placed the Military forces. i &apos; The Governments themselves had nominated the Land Commanders and therefore they could likewise name&apos;the Naval Commanders.ADMIRAL de BON said that had no orgaiiisation existed in the &quot; Mediterranean ho would at once have answered in the affirmative to Admiral Hope*s question,.     But since an organisation already existed in the Mediterranean, why create a new one ?GENERAL di ROBILANT agreed, but at the same time pointed out that Admiral dc Bon&apos;&quot;s remarks applied equally strongly to what was being done on land.        On land there already existed a Command and yet new arrangements had boon agreed to.&apos;ADMIRAL do BON explained that in his opinion the Land Commander had &quot;received a certain general mission which was. aimed at Bulgaria.      But he had received no mission as regards operations against the Turks.      The Naval forces, on the other hand, had contemplated the operations now in question and all necessary plans had been made.        They were ready. That, in his opinion, constituted a great difference.GENERAL di ROBILANT said that      doubt the Navy had oontemplated these operations from a general point of view, but they could . not have contemplated the particular operations now in question. , &apos; -ADMIRAL do BON replied that the case was not quite as stated by General di Robilant.      A Naval plan did exist for operations against the Dardanelles and Constantinople,     On land a new force was to be created.     The question therefore was: Could the existing Naval organisation adapt itself to the new territorial operations and work in co-operation ?  ,ADMIRAL HOPE intervening, said there was no intention, of upsetting&apos; the existing organisation..  But the forces at present in the Aegean had not been constituted with the object of ,carrying out the operations they now had in view. That force had been designed to meet a sortie from the Dardanelles.   Now&apos;r it ii       ,
its objective was to bo changed.     It was required to &apos;Cv;-,,p.;ratc in an attack en Constantinople,   - And, as the -British land forces were to be under a British General, it was desired that the Naval forces which wore to p--operate with the land forces should be placed under a British Admiral.        That is to say that the Sernior Naval Officer in the Aogchn should be a British Admiral.ADhlRAL de BON held that Admiral Hope&apos;o remarks e,uld net bomade ty apply to the main Naval&apos;operations to be undertaken. The f,rcing ef the Straits was a land operation.     The main objective ,.f the fleet c.uld only be to operate in the Blaok Sea.     It. was Organised precisely t\x encounter with the enemy forces in the Black Sea.GENERAL di HOBILANT said that arguments on both sides had been expressed very fully without leading to any agreement.      He Wv/uld. therefv.ro suggest that Admiral de Ben and Admiral Hope , should meet t-gethor and endeavour to sec if they Ceuld draw up a formula to which they could both subsoribe,GENERAL SACKVILLE-hEST said that apparently they could not agree. &quot;&quot;The British and&quot;lft:ench views had been put forward and ho suggested that the matter be referred to the Heads of tho Governments for their decision.GENERAL BELIN   said that provided their views were put before the Governments he was in complete agreement with the proposal made by General Sackville-West.GENERAL di ROBILANT summing up,, accepted the suggestion made by General Sackville-V.&apos;est.(This was agreed to)The full text of British Draft Resolution - as amended during the Meeting is as fillcws:-&quot;(a) The liaison between the Naval andMilitary forces operating in the Eastern portion of Macedonia and the Aegean Sea against the Ottoman Empire with a view to the reduoticn of Constantinople, and the opening of the Blaok Sea to the Allied Fleets, should be direct and of the closest nature.(b) As the Command of the Eastern section of theAllied Army marohing on Constantinople has been placed by the Allied, powers under the direct Command of a British General, who will be under the ordersjof the French Commander-in-chief, it is essential that the Allied Naval Command be likewise entrusted, so far as these operations in the Aegean are concerned to a British Admiral under the orders of the Allied Naval Commander-in-Chief, in order that the intimate co-operation between the two Services referred to in. paragraph (a) above may be ensured.&quot;
