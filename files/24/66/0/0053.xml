^   SECRET.(Jh\s document is the property his t$nta&quot;m(&apos;&quot;. majasty&apos;s government )MINISTRY  OF FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, October 9, 1918.part ;i.-action taken.-., The Food Controller visited Glasgow on Thursday, October 3. &apos; He was. received by the Divisional Food Commissioner (the .Hon. Gideon Murray), who accompanied Mm to the City Hall, the headquarters of the Glasgow Food Control Committee. Mr. Clynes complimented the Committee on, the efficient manner in which they rationed a larger number of people than any other single food office. He next attended a meeting of the Scottish Live Stock Advisor) Committee, over which Mr. A. P. McDougall, the Live Stock Commissioner for Scotland presided, and explained the causes which had led to the serious shortage of feeding-stuffs. In the afternoon he received deputations from the Scottish Federation of Grocers&apos;Association, and the Glasgow Retail Fruit Trade Association, and held a conference with the three Divisional Food Commissioners for Scotland and Mr. McDougall. In the evening Mr. dynes was entertained at dinner by the Lord Provost of; Glasgow, who afterwards presided at a large meeting in St. Andrew&apos;s Hall. ,After reviewing the causes of the recent increases in price of meat and milk, the Food Controller pointed out how far, more favourably we were situated than the people in other European countries. Ee declared unhesitatingly that for miners Or shipbuilders to leave their job in these times without reasonable cause was to strike the most cruel blow at men who were gallantly lighting for us at sea^ on land, and in the air.       , v -.     -, -   f   /-f&apos;,   , ,&apos;&apos; i r , , \The King has been pleased to confer a peerage of the United Kingdom upon Sir Charles Bathurst, K.B.E., M.P., Chairman of the Royal Commission on the Sugar Supply, Director of Sugar Distribution, and Vice-Chairrnan of the Central Agricultural Advisory Council. The new Peer will represent the Ministry of Food in the House -of Lords.The Food Council. Three meetings of the Council have been held since the last &quot;Report, Major Astor in the chair. :.,i , -: The terms of reference to the Central Milk Advisory Committee were agreed as follows : &quot; To advise the Pood Controller upon questions, other than financial questions, arising out of his decision to assume control over the&apos;wholesale milk trade.&quot; With regard to the constitution of the committee it was agreed that the trade representation should be reduced from 8 to 4, that a representative of the Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Congress should be included and that two representatives of -producers should he nominated by the Central Agricultural Advisory Committee. It was also decided that one of the representatives of the Consumers&apos; Council should be a woman and that in addition another woman should be nominated. 1It was further agreed that a sub-committee should be appointed by the Astor Committee to considerthe differentiation of prices by districts and other questions of policy.; c A memorandum by Mr. Beveridge on the rationing of soap and candles was -presented. It was agreed that it should be submitted to the Board of Trade for discussion and that in the meantime the decision of the Food. Controller should be obtained with a view to a memorandum being sent to the War Cabinet. It was subsequently reported that the Board of Trade were prepared to delegate powers for the-purpose of the control of soap to the Ministry of Food. ,-: , ; ,It was decided to recommend that for the present neither syrup nor honey should be included in the jam ration. - ;With regard to the suggested Committee on Food Prices and Wages it was (agreed that any such committee ought to. be appointed by the Government, and that before^ further steps were taken it was,desirable that the questipn should he discussed with the President of the Board of Trade. , . .... &apos;,. ,. , ..,a  (33)6638-2 &apos; Pk 1   140  10/18  E &amp; S &apos;&quot; A.
The question of the anticipated necessity of reducing the fats ration was considered, together with the desirability of reducing the price of margarine.The Imports Board. The Board have met six times since the last Report, Sir John Beale or (in his absence) Mr. J. R. Brooke in the chair.With regard to the Imports Programme for September to December a memo-rand irm by Mr. Yule on the revised figures put forward by the Allied Maritime Transport Council was considered. It was agreed that Sir Alan Anderson should inform the Committee of Representatives that this programme would need further consideration, pointing out that (a) the reduction in bacon was in contradiction to the policy urged by Mr. Hoover, and would almost certainly involve the re-introduction of rationing ;(6) if shipments of sugar were deferred, some assurance was necessary that they would come forward at a later date.It was decided that a general memorandum should be presented to the Cabinet dealing with the relations between the Department of Import Restrictions and the Ministry of Food.A memorandum on the position in respect of cocoa was considered, and it was agreed that the cocoa programme of 26,000 tons to the end of the year should stand.The Home Supplies Board. The second meeting of the Board was held on Thursday, October 3rd, Mr. Beveridge in the chair.It was reported that a decision had been taken, subject to Treasury consent, to lower the milling extraction of wheat to 85 per cent., which would release offals for feeding-stuffs at the rate of 22,000 tons a week.The provision of feeding-stuffs for poultry, sheep, and pigs was considered. The Chief Live Stock Commissioner undertook to work out an estimate of the amount of feeding-stuffs likely to be available during the coming year, including offals and damaged grain, as compared with the demand. The figures of the approximate amount of damaged grain were to be estimated on the basis of last year&apos;s figures, to be supplied by the Flour Mills Control Board. It was agreed that, on the basis of these estimates, a draft announcement should be prepared of the policy to be adopted in regard to sheep, poultry, and pigs.Mr. Wise undertook to investigate the possibility of canning, salting, and refrigerating as much meat as possible, and, further, to consider with the Live Stock Board the effect of raising the price of cattle graded at 56 per cent, or more.Committee of Representatives. Meetings of the Committee of Representatives, and of their Freight Committee, have been held at Trafalgar House during the week. A further letter has been received from the Allied Maritime Transport Council, containing their views as to the amount of tonnage likely to be available for food imports. Considerable progress has been made with the settlement of the Allied Food Programme for the four months ending December 31st, revised to meet the cut in imports, and it is hoped that this will be finally agreed this week.The question of the amount of oats to be imported for military purposes is being considered at a Conference with the Military Authorities in Paris.Consumers Council. At the meeting of the Council on Wednesday, October 9th, the following resolutions were put and carried : &quot; (1) It being manifest that the winter price fixed for milk to producers is seriously in excess of the actual cost of production in many parts of the country, and that much dissatisfaction is being expressed by consumers at the great increase over last winter&apos;s price, whilst producers themselves are prepared to accept a lesser price, this Council suggests to the .Food Controller the advisability of a revision of the price in areas where a reduced price would be adequate to meet the circumstances.&quot;&quot; (2) That in view of the large increase in the amount, of excess profits tax estimated to be paid and actually paid into the National Exchequer and the continuous and progressive rise in the prices of articles of food, it is &apos;/ desirable that this Council should be furnished with information as to theproportion of excess profits tax received by the Exchequer on account of profits on food production and distribution.&quot;Captain Peck explained that the quantities of cheese distributed in the past month were 100 per cent, imported, 50 per cent. British, and 100 per cent. Caerphilly cheese on the datum period basis, which was a good set-off to last year.   At present the
cheese went to shops on the datum period basis, and 2,000 tons had been placed at the disposal of Food Commissioners for the next three months for the needs of heavy-workers. The Ministry maintained the price of Is. Sd., and would bear any loss at factories in the making of cheese arising from the enhanced price of milk.Mi\ Towle explained the principle of the Restaurant Prices Order, and that the plan adopted.in France had been followed of making restaurant proprietors exhibit outside their establishments their prices for meals, with power to the Food Controller to reduce those prices if he considered them unreasonable. The Order was approved.Orders under Defence of the1 Realm Regulations.(1) The Fish (Prices) No. 3 Order, 1918, dated 25th September 1918, alters the price of certain kinds of fish. The price of white fish is reduced by 15 to 20 per cent. The Order comes into force on October 21.(2) By an Order dated 5th October 1918, provision is made for the reappoint-ment of Food Control Committees in November, 1918. An important object of the Order is to secure a wider and more direct representation of labour, women, and the co-operative movement. The minimum number on a committee is to be 8 and the maximum number 12, except in districts having a population at the last census of over 20,000, when it may be increased to 16. At least two members of every com-mittee must be women, and three members must be representatives of labour, unless the total number is under 12, when there must be two. In any district in which a cO-operative society is established, if any food trader is appointed, a representative of the co-operative movement must also be appointed. As a general rule not more than three farmers are to he appointed on a committee, but in certain rural districts -where it is impossible, to secure a suitable committee without exceeding this number-additional appointments of farmers may be made, with the approval of the Divisional Food Commissioner.(3) The Milk (Distribution) Order, 1918, dated 5th October 1918, gives the Food Controller power to modify the distribution of milk in accordance with the needs of each district, and authorises him to issue directions relating to the collection, allocation, distribution and treatment of milk.(4) The Wholesale Milk Dealers (Control) Order, 1918, dated 5th October ,1918. Under this Order the Food Controller takes control of all premises in Great Britain of persons engaged in the wholesale distribution and manufacture of milk and milk products,   Milk products include butter, milk, cheese, condensed milk and dried milk.(5) The Barley (Registration of Wholesale Dealers) (Ireland) Order, 1918, dated 7th October 1918, prohibits all dealing in barley in Ireland, except under licence, and requires certain records to be kept, and returns made. The Order does not apply to a grower dealing with his own barley.Supplies and Prices.Bacon, Hams, and Lard. The price of 201. a ton suggested by the National Salvage Council for bacon and hams found .unfit for human consumption is considered insufficient, and the matter has been placed before the Costings Department.Butter. 4,500 tons of butter have recently been purchased in the Argentine. Information has been received that the United States Food Administration has requisitioned 60 per cent of stored butter, and that arrangements have now been completed to fulfil our programme of 8,000 tons lor the period May October.With regard to Canadian butter, it is hoped to secure about 3,000 tons on. the Food Board&apos;s Requisition Order; this should average 500 tons per week until the 9th of November. . &apos;Butter stocks on hand amount to 7,000 tons.Cocoa. The lists of raw cocoa available for distribution sent in by the grading committees amount to 39,800 bags. The fortnightly distribution will be made on Thursday, October 10th.Dried Fruits.-An allocation of 400 tons of currants from recent arrivals has been made to the Navy and Army Canteen Board. Further small quantities of dried fruits have been released to various: organisations for, making plum puddings for sailors and soldiers. $ . : ./.
A meeting of the Advisory Committee is being held next week to discuss the question of a release of dried fruits for Christmas.Arrangements have been made with the, Treasury for the importation of .500 tons of Spanish dried fruits on private account. t       r jFeeding-Stuffs. The scheme for the rationing of cattle feeding-stuffs will come into operation on November 17th, and will apply to farmers in England, Wales rand Scotland. The general application form is now being circulated; the rationing principle is adopted, and the details for its administration are available to applicants. The period covered by the scheme, as drawn at present, is from November 17th to January 25th, and stock-owner.s are reminded that all application forms obtainable from any licensed dealer in feeding-stuffs for supplies for these ten weeks should be filled up and lodged with the applicants usual dealer on or before October .15th. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that the filling up of the appropriate form is-an essential preliminary to the procuring of feeding-stuffs during the winter months. The generalform is drawn up in a manner that makes compliance with its conditions easy, and the explanatory notes are minute and clear.A. scheme for supplying feeding-stuffs for utility breeds of poultry and for horses used for other than agricultural purposes is being put forward.Meat. The arrangements for feeding the Army on home-killed meat, mentioned in last week&apos;s Report, have been developed and set out in detail. The Army will take meat slaughtered under the supervision of the Ministry at defined points. In order to facilitate slaughtering, which has been very difficult, owing to shortage of labour, the Army authorities are placing the services of experienced slaughtering gangs at the disposal of the Ministry.Owing to the fact that there is in store a large quantity of meat damaged during ocean transit, it has been decided, as from October 9th until further notice, to allow beef sausages to be sold without coupons in catering establishments. .      . ,,The Ministry have requisitioned all stocks of canned meat held in lots of more than 100 cases, and are now releasing stocks in the hands of small holders, i,e., stocks of 100 to 250 cases, so as to enable the trade to carry on.Salt a preliminary meeting of representatives of the salt trade was held last week to discuss the prices proposed by this Ministry. An Advisory Committee was formed to go into the whole question with the Costings Department.- Tea.-The distribution of tea supplies after the. 28th December 1918, has been the subject of discussion at several conferences. It is proposed to continue existing methods until the 26th January 1919, and after that date to base distribution on buying authorities certified by Food Control Committees.Use of Potatoes in Bread. The Food Controller has decided to make the use of potatoes in the manufacture of bread compulsory throughout the United Kingdom as soon as the main crop of potatoes is generally available. It is proposed&apos; that as soon after the 1st November as may. be found practicable, bakers shall be required to use 20 lbs. of potatoes per sack of flour.If this programme can be carried out for eight months, the period during which it is thought that potatoes will be available for this purpose, 200,000 tons of potatoes would be used in place of 100,000 tons of flour.It. is suggested that the potatoes shall be sold to bakers at ol. 10s. per, ton delivered, as was the case last season, and that the difference between Zl. 10s. and the actual cost of the potatoes shall be added to the bread subsidy. In practice this will effect a nett saving ; the subsidy on the potatoes used will be less than the subsidy on the flour saved, and it is estimated that the arrangement will effect a saving on the total amount of the bread, subsidy of 750,000L per annum.There are other advantages : 100,000 tons of shipping will be saved, and exchange in America will be relieved to the extent of approximately 3,O00,0O0Z., the value of 100,000 tons of flour in America.The details of the scheme have been submitted to the Treasury and assent obtained.Divisional Rjepokts.. The winter prices fixed for milk are having very various effects in different parts of; the country.&apos; It is reported from the North-Western Division that eight strikes have occurred, stopping the supply of milk to 850,000 persons, but prompt action was
taken, and the disputes were successfully dealt with. In the Midland and West of Scotland Divisions serious trouble is not, it is said, anticipated.In North Wales some discontent is aroused and the Commissioner is arranging conferences of producers and dealers to discuss the matter. In the Home Counties a serious position arose at Chelmsford, owing to a strike of dairymen, on the ground that the retail price fixed by the Committee M. a quart, did not cover distribution expenses. The Commissioner met the Borough and Rural Committees and the dairy-men concerned and made a strong appeal to the latter with the result that the dispute was settled. Local feeling was strongly in favour of the action of the Committee, and some 4,000 men in the local Government works threatened to &quot; down tools &quot; unless the Committee stood firm.In the North Midlands it is reported that there appears to be a general recognition of the fact that the high price of cows and feeding-stuffs, and difficulties connected with labour, necessitate a considerable advance in the price of milk to producers.Enforcement of Orders.The summary of the prosecutions for the past week is as follows : Prosecutions.    Convictions.England		- 446	412Scotland	-            -            -	-   29	29Wales	-             -             -	-   59	-   56Ireland	-	-  295	280	Total  -	- 829	777The percentage of convictions is 1 * 7 higher this week than last.Local inspectors in the Northern and Midland Divisions appear to have shown considerable activity in detecting breaches of the Potato and Rationing Orders. In the latter instance a number of heavy fines are recorded.PART II-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.Imports in the week ended the 5th October (177,200 tons) improved somewhat on those of the preceding week (164,200 tons), but the total for the first five weeks ; of the cereal year (862,000 tons) are still 100,000 tons, or 10 per cent., below those : for the corresponding weeks of last year (962,000 tons), while the totals for the first 40 weeks of the calendar year have fallen from 9,419,000 in 1917 to 7,213,000 in 1918, that is, by 23 per cent. (Table A).Compared with the preceding week, the imports in the week ended the 5th October, showed an improvement in beef (5,000 tons increase), bacon (4,300 tons increase), sugar (19,000 tons increase), and maize (8,000 tons increase). On the other&apos; hand, there was. a decreased import of wheat and wheaten flour (the decrease in equivalent grain being from 98,200 tons to 85,300 tons), mutton, other meat, and butter.   No rice or barley arrived.Comparing the first five weeks of the cereal years 1917-18 and 1918-19, it will be seen from the following table that there has been a substantial increase in the imports of wheat (100,000 tons), but a heavy fall in rice, barley, oats and maize (208,000 tons).; a fall in meat (8,500 tons), but a big rise in bacon (37,000 tons), and lard (14,200 tons); a. rise in condensed milk (14,700 tons), in tea (2,o00 tons), and in cocoa (6,000 tons); and a heavy fall in sugar (64,300 tons). The total imports of sugar during the first 40 weeks of 1918 have, however, been equal to those during the corresponding 40 weeks of 1917 (Table A).     -        .. .................A.   6638-2 . B

The consumption of flour continues to increase.   This is indicated by the following figures showing the average weekly quantities delivered, from mills and issued to agents in the four weeks ended on the dates specified:   August    17th     - 91,100 tons.24th     - 92,700  ,,31st     -        - - -    95,200  ,,September 7th       -        - -   102,800   ,;14th     - 104,500 -,,21st     - . -        -  105,400   ,,28th     -        -        -        -  106,200  ,,The use of potatoes in bread has never reached any material proportion. The returns for the four weeks ended September 14th show, that only a small proportion of bakers use potatoes. The returns also show that to 75,000 tons of flour only 250 tons of potatoes were used.Meat. Table C shows that the numbers of cattle and sheep accepted for slaughter at markets in Great Britain were substantially less than in the preceding week. There lias been considerable difficulty in bringing down the supply to the reduced demand on the lower ration, but the temporary transference of the home army demand from frozen meat to fresh meat, which begins this week, should ease the situation. Civilian consumption of frozen meat, which averaged 6,900 tons in August, has now been reduced to 1,100 tons. Home supplies of butcher&apos;s meat of all kinds for the week amounted to about 19,000 tons, a total which represents a consider-able margin over the ration quantity, even after allowance is made for waste and offal.Provisions.-The returns from multiple shops and co-operative societies for the four weeks ended 28th September, indicate a slight rise in the consumption of pro-visions (Table E). The greatest increase has been in cheese the sales of which are 50 per cent, higher than in the preceding four weeks and now exceed the sales in any period since November last. The slight increase in lard brings the sales up to the average for July and August. There has been a seasonal decrease in butter and no material change in bacon. Stocks in hand, have been enlarged, especially in the case of cheese with 10 days&apos; supply instead of four, and lard with 27 days&apos; supply instead of 20.The actual weights sold included in the returns taken from these shops are shown in the following table :  ,	Sales in four weeks ended			Percentage change, &apos;j. &apos; Sept. 28th on		Sept. 28th, 1918.

Stocks of beef have increased 2,000 tons, butter and margarine 2,000 tons, and lard 2,000 tons. On the other hand, stocks of mutton have decreased 1,000 tons, and rabbits 1,000 tons. The stocks of rabbits have been declining steadily from 16,000 tons on 15th June to 5,700 tons on 28th September. The stocks of condensed milk have now reached 40,000 tons.Prices.The general level of retail prices of the principal food-stuffs has risen approxi-mately 6 per cent, during September. The only decrease recorded is in potatoes, from Sd. -to 7fcZ. per 7 lbs. The increase of 2d. per lb. in the retail price of meat (noticed in last week&apos;s Report) has resulted in a rise ranging from 10 per cent, in the best joints of British mutton to 18 per cent, on the cheapest joints of frozen mutton, the average rise being about 12\ per cent. The increasing price of milk is recorded as a rise from 6f(Z. per quart on 1st September to Sd. per quart on 1st October, or 20 per cent. Fresh butter has increased from 2s. id. per lb. to 2s. b\d. per lb., or by rather more than 5 per cent. ; the increase in the case of salt butter being 6 per cent.A 6608-20Milk. The returns of the railway carriage of milk show.a continuation of the normal movement to which reference was made last week.Fish. Arrivals of fish at Billingsgate and at several provincial markets in recent weeks are given in the table below. The weekly average for September is 21 per cent, below that for August which, however, is less than the normal seasonal decrease.
