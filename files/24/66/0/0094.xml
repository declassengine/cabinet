With reference to the discussion at yesterday&apos;s Cabinet, I circulate herewith a brief memorandum with regard to the steps which have already bean taken to ascertain tho feelings of tho natives in the ex-German....Colonies with regard to their remaining under British Rule.COLONIAL OFFICE.W.H.L.15-.10.1918,
2S9   !&quot;mmtimi for war cabinet.On 4th January 1918 Mr. Long telegraphed to Australia, Now Zealand and South Africa as follows (947/S)&quot;Secret.It is the firni conviction of His Majesty&apos;s Government that, for security of Empire after the far, it is necessary to retain possession of Gorman Colonies, but it has not been possible to secure general acceptance of this view owing to divergence of opinion among Allies. Great stress was laid by Russians during recent negotiations with Germans on right of population of country to determine its future, and proposal was made to apply this to German Colonies. There are indications in French newspapers, for instance, that this line cf argument will be pressed in other quarters.   I should, therefore, be glad if I-could be furnished with a statement suitable for publication, if necessary, containing evidence of anxiety of natives of (German New Guinea) (Samoa) (South-West Africa) to live under British rule.   Summary should be sent as soon as possible by telegraph and statement itself by mail.   I should also bo glad to receive any suggestions which Ministers may wish to make on the subject.LONG.   &quot;T he fullest reply received has boon from the Union which sent a series of statements on oath by responsible and respected leaders of the various native races of South-fest Africa (13045).   These were included in Mr.Gorges report, but wg struck out by the Foreign Office before the report was laid before Parliament.,  New Zealand
New Zealand has sent a despatch from tho Administrator of Samoa showing that the High Chiefs and Chiefs are practically unanimous ih wishing to remain under British rule (7553/S).   The New Zealand Government were of opinion that it would not bo practicable to approach the natives except through the Chiefs (2092/S).The information supplied with regard to Gorman New Guinea is much less satisfactory.   The natives arc very back-ward and have little understanding of what has occurred (3111/40 and we have no expression of their wishes except in the case . of Nauru.The High Commissioner for the Western Pacifie has forwarded a message from the Nauruan Chiefs expressing their wish to remain under the King!s protection.A similar telegram was sent on the 8th January to the Administrator of German East Africa, the Governor-General of Nigeria and the Governor of the Gold Coast.A -full reply has been received from the Administrator of German East Africa, the gist of which is as follows:- -Observation and discreet enquiry show that satis-faction is widespread at the cessation of the savage punishments inflicted by the Germans, at the careful investigation of cases by responsible officers^h^rson, and particularly at the euppros^sia^^rtruliality andextortion by GermairtaCivo police and subordinates,fIn those districts which have been less affected by the passage of troops and by lines of communication British-rule is accepted willingly, as the attitude of the .   natives towards Nauman&apos;a irruption and the spontaneous attack on one of his convoys showed.   Also the Administrator&apos;a own reception when on tour had been genuinely warm.   In other parts the effect of the great hardships which have arisen out of the war will take sometime
time to wear off.   The Administrator was quite opposed bo thb principle of a plebiscite but, given twelve months of peace-ful administration, he had not the slightest doubt that the mass of the people, as opposed to the ex-German minor offi-cials, would infinitely prefer to remain under tho protection of the British.In the case of Togoland, the Governor of the Gold Coast sent a special commissioner through the districts in British&apos; occupation.   These commissioners held meetings with practically every Chief and a great number of the Sub-Chiefs .  He was every-where very cordially received and the meetings were largely attended.   The desire was universally expressed and with un-mistakeable emphasis to be under British rule and not given back to Germany.The Governor has reported fully on the subject.In the case of the Cameroons the Governor General of Nigeria has also reported fully on the districts in the Cameroons which are in British occupation.The British officers in charge of those districts have taken every possible step to ascertain, by meetings of the Chiefs, oG., the feeling of the population, with the result that there is a practically unanimous desire on the part of the people to remain under British rule, and a universal dread of a return of the Germans to the country.
