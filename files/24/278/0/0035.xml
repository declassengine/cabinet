THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1938.Copy .No,      46CABINET.CENTRAL EUROPE.CZECHOSLOVAKIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE herewith for the information of my colleagues the texts of telephone conversations which I had this morning with Mr. Winston Churchill and Mr. Anthony Eden.September 14, 1938.I.Mr. Winston Churchill telephoned to me this morning. He said that he wished to press with all the urgency that he could command the proposal he had previously made that we should at once take action by way of addressing a joint note with France and Russia to Berlin. In his judgment there was still time for this manifestation of solidarity to produce its effect and save disaster. It would, in Mr. churchill&apos;s view, powerfully influence the attitude of Poland, already moved to a great extent to anti-German feeling, and it should be possible at Geneva to organise what Mr. Churchill again solemnly termed the posse comitatus in such effective fashion as to roll back the present imminent danger. He did not ask that we should definitely say that we should immediately consider ourselves at war if there was German aggression on Czechoslovakia, but he thought that we were, in fact, so far committed to France by the statement made on Sunday that to take the further step would, in fact, make little difference. Such action as he recommended would, he thought, rally powerfully all those elements in Europe who were watching for a strong lead, and though the course might appear dangerous, he was convinced that, in fact, it did not increase the danger in which we alreadv stood and was more likely to dispel it.H.September 14, 1938.II.Mr. Eden rang me up this morning and said that he would like to give me an account of how his mind and that of others whom he had seen was working. This was that we and the French Government should issue a public statement, not necessarily jointly, but on similar lines. These lines would, I understood from him, be emphasising the gravity of the situation and repeating in solemn10047   [17886]SECRET.CP. 200 (38).&apos; f.v    - i.I (I
form the warning of dangerous consequences if Germany resorted to violence. If we and the French chose to secure corresponding action by Russia, he did not think there would be any objection to that, but he did not suggest a joint note. I asked him whether he contemplated carrying the definition of the position of this country further than we had already taken it, and he said that he did not press this, but thought that we might possibly get rather nearer to the point of saying that if the French were in, we should be in. He understood that we had said rather more in private to the French than we had said publicly, but on this point I told him he was misinformed.H..September 14, 1938.
