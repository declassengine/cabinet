ENCLOSUREaC.O.S.  765.  / :&apos;c^ :&apos;-Qo.___COMMITTEE OF Ife?&apos;;JRl,.;L DEFENCE. dCHIEFS OF ST..,FF SUB-COMMITTEE.APPRECIATION OF THE SITUATION IN THE EVENT OF W/.R AGAINST GERMANY.EXPORT.SWe have been instructed to prepare, as a matter of urgency?an up-to-date appreciation showing the situation which will arise in the event of our being involved in immediate hostilities against Germany.2. We have made the following political and militaryassumptions as basis for our appreciation.,3. (a)    Political Assumptions.(i)    The basis of the present Appreciation isthat we should be drawn into hostilities as a result of German aggression against Czechoslovakia,  since this would lead to intervention first by France and then by ourselves.(ii)    Italy might combine with Germany against us from the outset, or she might await some clarification of the military situation before she commits herself definitely.      Our initial dispositions, with particular reference to the Eastern Mediterranean, must be framed to meet the former eventual it;?-.    Such dispositions will place us in a better position to influence Italy&apos;s attitude ana possibly to deter her from joining Germany.
(iii) Japanese operations in China continue to absorb a considerably greater proportion of her land forces and economic strengths than she probably anticipated.    Nevertheless, there are undoubted indications that Japan may avail herself of a good opportunity to.further her ambitions in the Far East at our expense. We must therefore assume Japan to be potentially hostile.(iv) The United States of America, despite an appreciable movement of informed opinion away from isolation, cannot he relied upon to come to pur assistance.(v) The attitude of the U.S.S.R. is incalculable,and it is unsafe to assume that Soviet Russia would go to the assistance of Czechoslovakia.(vi) Palestine already absorbs a considerable inilitary force, and the local authorities have asked for further reinforcements.    There is a danger that the infection, of lawlessness may spread to neighbouring Mohammedan countries. Consequent^ Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the Yemen, and perhaps\also Persia, must for some time to come be regarded as uncertain friends,.(vii) franco Spain is likely to be sympathetic towards Germany, and may be&apos; expected to afford port facilities which would be of value to Germany&apos;s naval forces attacking our trade routes.(viii) The remaining countries in the world, with the exception of Portugal and Egypt, are assumed to be initaliy neutral.4,        (B) Military Assumptions, (i) General.The present dispositions of the German   Army indicate that her most probable course of action would he to occupy the wholeor part of Czechoslovakia whilst standingon the defensive in the west.(ii) Naval.Immediately hostilities with Great Britain   . commenced,it is probable that Germany would make the greatest possible use of her submarine forces.    She might also employ raiders on our trade routes.
(iii) Array.On land Germany would prosecute a vigorous military offensive against Czechoslovakia, at the same time manning her strong fortifications in the west.(iv) Air,Germany would in the first instance develop an overwhelming air offensive against Czechoslovakiao      It may he that she would refrain from air action against either Prance or Great Britain unless and until she is herself subjected to attack by one or both of us. Alternatively she might concentrate her main effort in the air against her most powerful   opponents, Great Britain and/or Prance,  immediately she realised that their intervention was inevitable05. (C) Time Factor.It is assumed in this appreciation that france will become involved in war against Germany within a few days of German aggression against Czechoslovakia, and there will be no appreciable time lag in Great Britain&apos;s intervention.FACTORS AFFECTING THE SITUATION,Economics.6. We have examined the present economic situation of theprincipal belligerents and have reached the following Conclusions.Germany.(a) In spite of her efforts to attain self-sufficiency, there still remain many commodities essential for German war-time resistance which she cannot by any means obtain from accessible countries.      We are advised that the overall level of stocks in Germany suffices for a war of national effort of about three months, but rigorous economic pressure must thereafter become a factor progressively limiting the duration of her resistance a      It must be remembered, however, that the excellent distributive system which she controls radiating from Vienna towards South Bast Europe and her probable control of Baltic corniriunications will greatly facilitate replacement of the desired commodities from accessible sources.
(b) The occupation of Czechoslovakia by germany would not make her self-sufficient, though it would increase the degree of pressure which she could bring to bear on the neutrals of south-eastern Europe to provide her with some of her war requirements:,(c) The loss of the Ruhr-Rhineland-Saar districts,in which are concentrated a major proportion of Germany&apos;s coal, steel and engineering products industries as well as over half of her industrial population? or severe curtailment of their activity could not fail eventually to prove decisive in a war of national effort,(d) In order to, bring the full weight of economic pressure to bear on German sea-borne trade, it will be necessary to institute an effective system of control over imports of all countries with which Germany is in a position to communicate by roadF rail, or river by naval., diplomatic and commercial action, as was done in 1914-18,(e) Economic pressure on Germany might be supplemented, after the initial stage by air attack on manufacturing plant and centres of storage and distribution in Germany itself0Italy.(f)    On balance we are of the opinion that,purely from the economic point of view, Italian intervention should prove more of a liability than an asset to Germany,Great Britain.(a) The maintenance of sea-borne imports offood-stuffs and raw materials is of vital importance to the United Kingdom, At the same time every effort must be made to maintain our export trade at the highest possible levelo(b) No serious difficulty is likely to be felt in replacing from other sources commodities normally derived from Germany, but supplies from the United States of America will depend on the interpretation placed upon the Neutrality Act,
Prance.(c)    The industrial weakness of Prancein relation to her requirements as a first-class Power in a major war, the inadequacy of her merchant fleet,  and the exposed geographical position of her leading industries and key points in her distributive system, combine to render the French economic situation extremely serious.(d)    The main sources from which the French deficiencies might be mad.e good, are Great Britain and the United states the burden will fall upon ourselves will therefore depend upon how far supplies&quot;&apos; can be obtained irom the United States of America,  despite the restrictions due to the Neutrality Act.(e)    The geographical position.of czechoslovakia and the low capacity of her ccmraunicaticns through neutral countries will severely handicaj her in any attempt to augment her own resources when at war with Germany.of America.The extent to whichCzechoslovakia.Comparison of Forces,7.Precisefigures of the armed forces of theseveral belligerents are available but we, have not thought it appropriate to include details in a&apos;-paper of this scope.
8. Whereas,  at sea, G-reat Britain and- France havea marked advantage over Germany,  on land and in theair they are at a disadvantage.      Even if the Czechoslovak    1IArmy is included, Germany will probably be able to dispose as great,  if not greater,  strength than the combined strength of the three Allies.        A bare comparison of numerical strengths, however, may be misleading.In the initial stages Germany is likely to employIa large proportion of her land and air forces towardsobtaining a quick decision in Czechoslovakia;    nevertheless   I11she could still man her new field fortifications in the west in sufficient strength to render any initial French land offensive a costly &quot;and probably ineffective operation.    I9. The intervention of Italy would materially increasethe strength of the hostile sea,  land and air forces and by widening the theatre&apos;of operations to include the Mediterranean would very seriously embarrass France and Great Britain in their problem of combating Germany.10. In the event of Japanese intervention, we couldnot despatch an adequate naval force to the Far East,  and at the same time hold the Eastern Mediterranean in any strength.      The decision as to which course should be adopted! would have to be decided by the Government in the light of the then existing circumstances.      If it should be decided to] despatch strong naval forces to the Far East we should have to rely for our security in the Middle East upon the land andj air forces already located there   until such time as it was possible to reinforce them via the Cape,  or possibly via the overland route from Basrah.
11.       We now turn to an examination, of the courses of action open to Germany on the one side and to ourselves, France and Czechoslovakia on the other, in the opening phases of the war.     In the short time available for the preparation of this appreciation, it is impossible to deal in detail with the complications introduced by the inter-vent ion of other Powers.     Germany has the   initiative and our action must be conditioned to a considerable extent by her action and by that of our allies,German attack on Czechoslovakia*IS.       Germany has already mobilised most of her active forces.     At sea she could do little or nothing to protect her   trade except in the Baltic.      On land she would have to retain divisions on her other land frontiers, where, it is assumed, she will stand on the defensive0-Her A.A. Defences and Air Raid Precautions are believed to be in a high state of efficiency and readiness, and the large number of German aerodromes confers great flexibility on her air forces which could concentrate at short notice in any area require do15.       We have assumed that Germany&apos;s most probable course of action would be to occupy the whole or part of Czechoslovakia, whilst standing on the defensive in the West.Broadly speaking, Germany&apos;s action might take one of the following forms: -(a) An advance with the limited objective of theoccupation of the Sudeten area alonej(b) the occupation of the whole of WesternCzechoslovakia, including Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia.
(c) the elimination of Czechoslovakia from the war by the defeat of the Czechoslovak Army.From our knowledge of the German dispositions (see map) it seems reasonable to assume that Germany could easily achieve either of the first two objectives without any appreciable delay;    and could proceed to the third at will./&apos; I14.     Apart from any preliminary action such as fomenting armed insurrection in the Sudeten areas or the infiltration of troops, S.S. and police across the Czechoslovakian frontier, it is probable simultaneous offensives will be launched across the northern and southern frontiers with Prague as the objectivee     We estimate that 20 regular divisions (including 8 armoured motorised and light divisions) are already concentrated opposite the Czecho--slovakian frontiers, ready to move at instant notice, and these are likely to be reinforced by some reserve divisions. In addition, practically the whole of her air force would be available for this operation.,15e       To meet this threat Czechoslovakia possesses 21 divisions (including 4 mobile divisions) and this number might possibly be doubled within a few days by reserve divisions..     These would be supplemented by a first-line air strength of approximately 600 first-line aircraft, including about 200 bombers and 250 fighters.      It is thought, however, that preliminarydispositions of her land forces will involve a considerable dispersion of these forces, owing to her extensive frontiers.     Faced, by an encircling German advance, Prague and Plzen could not hold out for long and the main defence would probably be in the^Tote.   A percentage of the personnel of the CzechoslovakArmy is drawn from disaffected minorities, including 10 per cent. Sudeten,- and this will prove a source of weakness.
9 F-&apos; 9 e3 ej 0Moravian quadrilateral.     Although, recently considerable work has been carried out on the defensive works in Bohemia and Moravia, they are still incomplete; anti-tank obstacles have been made in some areas0 Information has been received from commercial sources that Czechoslovakia intends to use gas for defensive pur-poses.THE INTERVENTION OF FRANCE AND GREAT BRITAIN. 16.     We now turn from the consideration of the limited theatre of operations in Czechoslovakia and briefljr review the military implications of the intervene tion of France and Great Britian in the war0British Security Measures.17.     Navy.    Should Germany make vigorous use of her available submarine forces, our counter measures should enable us to prevent her from obtaining any marked success even by unrestricted warfare, although we must expect losses in the initial stages.      If ships of the &quot;Deutschland&quot; Class or other raiders were to break out on the trade routes, considerable dispersion of forces would be needed to protect the shipping in the threatened areas018.     Army.    On land the whole of such anti-aircraft resources ESI we at present possess will be required for the air defence of Great Britain, and there will be many calls on the regular and territorial army for
assistance to the civil power in the  initial stage SoWe consider that, as we must take account  of Italian and Japanese intervention in formulating our initial plan, the first commitment of our land forces, after the security of the United Kingdom should he the security of Egypt and of our interests in the Middle Easts At the same time, it nay he most desirable, and even absolutely essential, ultimately to despatch a Field Force to Franceo Consequently our aim should be to preserve the Intermediate Contingent for this purpose, and to provide tho necessary reinforcements for the Middle East from other sources,The despatch of reinforcements to the Middle East will be all the more necessary owing to the deterioration of the position in Palestine,, We regard with gaavc concern the possibility of the spread of disaffection to other Moslem Countries, involving us in a steadily increasing military commitment in the Middle East, and one which would be a most serious embarrassment to us in the event of war with Germany,,1.90 Air0 All our available Metropolitan air strength must be devoted to operations againstGermany   with   the   primary   aim   of the    defence   of   the   United   Kingdom^
&amp; &amp; **No air reinforcements will, therefore, he available for Imperial defence overseas, and this would leave our defence against Italian air attack on Egypt very weak.Offensive measures,20.       Navy.   We should at once initiate the application of economic pressure by seizing German shipping at sea and by putting into force the plans for world-wide contraband control in conjunction with patrols at sea, but we cannot expect any immediate effect from this action.21.       Army.     The conduct of the war on land would be the responsibility of the French.     We do not know whether they intend to stand on the defensive on the Maginot line, or to attempt an offensive across the frontier, but, in our opinion, Germany will be able to spare adequate forces to hold her fortified line in the West against attack.The most that we could do at the outset would be to provide a force of two divisions which would be inadequately equipped for any offensive operations.
22.      Air.    We have thought it right, to assume thatGermany would,  in the first instance,  aevote practicallythe whole of her air forces to attacking czechoslovakia and she might refrain from an action against eitherPrance or Great Britain until she is herself subjected to air attack by one or both of us.        Initially, therefore,it might seem that the initiative in the air lay with us.23.    It must be remembered, however,  that Germany&apos;s airpower is.at present considerably greater than our own.    Weare still in considerable doubt as to the range and capacity of the bombers with, which the German squadronsare now equipped.    Generally speaking, theie is some reason to believe that the German air-striking force,if concentrated against this country alone, might be able tomaintain a scale o f attack amounting possibly to as muchas 500-600 tons per day for the first two months of war,although only a proportion of this weight could be directed against London and the principal. industrial centres.24.    There are, however, many factors such as thenecessity for diverting some proportion,  even of thelong-range bombers,  against Prance and Czechoslovakia,the extreme distanceo f many important objectives inGreat Britain from German bases., and the weather conditions prevalent in the North Sea, which render it extremely unlikely that anything like this scale o f attack would be maintained against vulnerable points in this country25.    On a comparative basis our own scale of attackat the present time would be less than 100 tons per day.We have no knowledge  .--f whether the French have givenconsideration to the question of a strategic bomber offensive;
tlieir war organisation does not appear to provide for any concentration of air attack against a specific objective, since their bombers are split up into regional commands corresponding to different portions of their frontier.     Nevertheless we consider that the French scale of attack on Germany might be as much as twice the British figure or about 200 tons a day, Awing to the lack of reservesj however,  it is unlikely that either we ourselves or the French could sustain this scale of attack for more than a limited time.26. In view of this inferiority in air power and thefact that as a reprisal for any air offensive we might undertake Germany could rapidly switch a far heavier scale of attack upon the Allies, we must take into account the present weakness of our air defences, both active and passive in formulating any plan for an allied air offensive against Germany in the initial phases.27. Broadly speaking there are two possible groups of objectives for the Allied bombers.(a) Objectives whose destruction would have theeffect of embarrassing Germany economically or affecting her power to maintain her military forces in the field.(b) Purely military objectives, whose destructionwould have the effect of reducing the scale of air attack Germany could bring to bear on England or France. 28. In view of the political objections to the initiation of any action by the Allies which might be misrepresented as an attack upon the civil populace, and the fact that the great initial advantage in air striking power which Germany possesses constitutes a
potential menace to the security of this country, we consider that on balance we should be unwise to initiate air attack upon industrial targets in Germany.     We make this recommendation with the full knowledge that we are refusing to take advantage of a fleeting opportunity to attack the &quot;Achilles heel&quot; of our enemy Apart from the considerations mentioned above our main reason is that the weight of attack which we and the French could deliver is in our opinion inadequate to produce decisive results and must jnev:Vbably.provokeimmediate reprisal action on the part of Germany&apos; at a time when our defence measures at home both active--^oad passive are&apos; very Har^tx-QU:. -oomple te.--G^NCLUSJON.29.      It is -our^&quot;.pj^ion^ that, no-pressure that Great Britain and France can bring to bear, -either by sea, on land,  or in the air,  could prevent Germany from overrunning Bohemia and from inflicting a decisive defeat on Czechoslovakia.      The restoration of Czechoslovakia&apos;s lost integrity could only be achieved by the defeat of Germany and as the outcome of a prolonged struggle, which from the outset must assume the character of an unlimited war.30.      The intervention of Italy and/or Japan on the side of Germany would create a situation which the Chiefs of Staff in their Mediterranean and Middle35&apos;East Appreciation     described in the following language:-Paper No. D.P.(P.)  18.
&quot;Moreover, war against Japan, Germany and Ita&quot;Ly simultaneously in 1938 is a commitment which neither the present nor the projected strength of our defence forces is designed to meet, even if we were in alliance with Prance and Russia, and which would, therefore, place a dangerous strain on the resources of the Empire ......&quot;(Signed) O.L.N.
