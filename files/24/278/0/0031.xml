CZECHOSLOVAKIAMemorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith texts of three communications received from Sir Nevile Henderson at Nuremberg.      I need not emphasise their extremely confidential nature.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.COPY NO.CP.  196(38) *(Intd.)     H.FOREIGN OFFICE.11th September, 1938.
Extract from letter from Sir N, Henderson dated 8th September.For Heaven&apos;s sake send no more instructions as on May 21st.      Believe me that would uttlerly defeat our object and ensure what we are trying to avoid.     God knows I may be wrong but I must take this responsibility. I have made the position as clear as daylight to the people who most matter and our best friends tell me that another May 21st would upset the whole apple cart in Hitler&apos;s present mood.     Once Runciman has spoken, once H.M.G. have decided that such or such solution at Prague is just and likely to be permanent, then we can say &quot;if you try to force another solution, beware&quot;, but not before.     The solution lies at Prague, not Berlin today.     Henlein himself has the Plebiscite solution up his sleeve if Benes will not agree to something amounting to the Karlsbad programme.      That is better than driving-Hitler over the edge with another May 21st.I suggested to Goebbels today that a line for Hitler&apos;s Monday&apos;s speech might be as follows;    &quot;I welcomed British intervention in May as I hoped H,M.G. might persuade Benes to be reasonable.     Benes was not sufficiently so and H.M.G. sent out Lord Runciman. Though the German Government was not consulted, we have not interfered and we still hope he will find a way out and we are still prepared to co-operate with H.M.G. in seeking a peaceful solution locally, i,e. between Czechs and Sudeten&quot;.     Goebbels said he would speak to Hitler and was far from discouraging the suggestion.      If Hitler says anything like this he will surely add his ideas as to
a peaceful solutuion which cannot be less than Karlsbad programme,,     He will certainly add that Germany cannot trust Benes and that something will have to be done to see that whatever Benes promises in faithfully executedoAnyway my view (and it is better to trust me even if I am wrong) is that all has been done now and we must await Monday&apos;s speech and pray that no further incidents occur in the meantime in Czechoslovakia,,     Goering assured me that no aggression was contemplated and certainly no sudden one.      But if Benes goes on &quot;havering&quot; that is what will provoke Hitler,Germany can   scarcely actively aggress while Runciman is at Prague and before he has come out with some declaration,.Hitier&apos;s position is that of a man bluffing with a full house in his hand.      If his bluff fails, he will show his full house, not throw in his hand.     The solution lies in Prague and if Benes (and he won&apos;t) can1t go far enough on his own, then Lord Runciman must come out with something of his own.     But before Runciman has done this, Hitler, though he may thunder on Monday, will not hum his boats.     That is my belief and I must back it, with a full sense of the great responsibility that I am taking.Both Ribbentrop and Goering told me that Henlein had reassured Hitler about Runciman, so that I feel that Hitler will give Rujoo&amp;naa.JxredltL and-wait.     My. only real apprehension is the unpredictability of Hitler and his moods.     One cannot guarantee - anything for that reason. I can but advise what I believe to be best:    I am acquainted with the views of H.M.G. and being on the spot I feel that they would be well advised to trust me. There are so many rumours and so much wind up in every
99^ti to iquarter that it is much more likely that I can gauge the temperatureo      One thing is of course certain.      None of us can ever think of peace again till Benes has satisfied Henlein,,      Henlein warits peace and will agree with Benes if the latter is made to go far enough.     Even if we forced the Germans to accept terms which would not satisfy the Sudeten,, it would not mean peacec     Versailles was the error which has got to be corrected.      Much as I hate saying so,  that is the hard fact.      Otherwise we must fight Germany again.      It is revision by war or revision by peaceful negotiation, which in fact means compulsion at Prague and not Berlin, because compulsion here settles nothing,,Goering said &quot;to me yesterday:    &quot;It is true that Hitler has decided that a solution must be found and if no time limit has been fixed German patience (i.3o Hitler&apos;s) has a limit all the same.      If a solution can be found locally at Prague, all the better:    if not, and we do not believe Benes will ever yield,  then another solution must be found outside Prague,      Benes cannot go on for ever refusing Germany&apos;s just pretensions on behalf of Germans who were just as much part of the old Austria as the Austrians themselves&quot;.That is an accurate,  in my opinion, summary of the situation.     Neurath too agrees with my appreciation of the position as I exposed it in London.     He is convinced that Hitler will be more moderate on Monday than people imagine,      But he has not seen Hitler-,Even Ribbentrop this morning was not unreasonable. His attitude was &quot;Provided Benes does something at once and does not merely talk,,     Wo don&apos; t believe a word of his promises:    only acts will make us believe he is genuine. No German believes that Benes will loyally execute anythinge
3* *7- o 4tj wForgive this scrawl.     I had expected to be on the way back to Berlin having done all I can here and this is all I have to write on.     The conditions one lives in, in a wagonlit compartment here, are inconceivable, Ifve had the greatest difficulty in getting a room in Nuremberg for the unfortunate messenger who returns with this.     That is one reason why I v/ant to fcet back to Berlin.     Anything more I say here is mere repetition and we must wait with anxiety for Monday.I shall see Neurath again tomorrow morning but another May 21st will, in my opinion, wreck all prospect of a peaceful outcome.Yours very sincerely, (Signed)     NEVILE HENDERSON.
IT,Letter from Sir Nevile Henderson dated 10th September.8 a.m.  additions to overnight on a piece of paper a secretary has just brought me from Berlin.The form of Hitler&apos;s genius is on the borderline of madness.-    He may already have stepped over the edge as some people believe.      If he has,  there is nothing to be done except believe that &quot;Quern Deus vult perdere&quot;-A second 21st May-will push him over the edge.    That I truly and honestly believe:    if not of actual madness, of mad action.If the worst comes H.M.G can truly say that the instructions they are now sending will have already been communicated by me to Ribbentrop and G-oering to Neurath, and others - Everybody here knows that I&apos;ve been running round here like a lunatic myself and no one who is here will doubt this for a moment.The Germans will know of the courier from London and the secretary from Berlin.      I told Neurath yesterday of the man from London.    I shall see Neurath this a.m.  at one of the meetings (Hitler Youth):&apos;    and since I have not got definite final instructions I shall tell him the gist of those instructions but say that H.M.G.  are thinking on those lines but still have confidence in Hitler&apos;s sincerity in his desire for peace,I do not believe that Hitler is contemplating a &quot;recourse to force&quot; now.      He may be violent in his speech but not that kind of violence yet.      An official demarche
will drive him to greater violence or greater menaces. Other sources may think they know better and Heaven knows how easily I may be wrong.      Brit even if I am, another warning will not help.-     If he has decided, that will not alter his decision.      If he has not decided,  that will help him to do so,  that is all. .The messenger has just come for this so I muststop.Yours ever,(Signed)    EEVILE HENDERSON.
O e3 1Mote by Sir Hevile Henderson dated 10th September,  paving his impressions at Nuremberg.Hitler when he received diplomats was not to be drawn into politics.    French Ambassador when saying: good-bye    said &quot;I hope Your Excellency can give me a favourable prognosis?&quot;     Hitler&apos;s answer was &quot;&quot;What of? The weather?     The forecasts are always wrong&quot;.The most pessimistic people here are the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.      Weizsacker says &quot;The situation is very, very serious&quot;, and the others say the same.    At the same time Weizsacker says too &quot;Another 21st May would be fatal,        The solution lies in Prague and in what you can say here&quot;,I spoke with brutal frankness to Goering.    I. asked, him as a personal suggestion in connection with some com-plimentary remark which Goering made about Runciman, whether he thought it would be a good thing if Lord Runciman visited Hitler,    He said that he could not say offhand but he obviously did not favour the idea and saw no object in it.Goering said &quot;We won&apos;t aggress the Czechs.    It.is they who will provoke us.      He gave me to understand -that Henlein had told Hitler that rather than accept a solution the Czech army would overthrow Hodza and make a coup d&apos;etat*-Goering suggested that then the Czechs would ask Runciman to go and might murder Henlein.      All his remarks (sometimes wild) were that Germany would not be the aggressor.
Goebbels said that the Benes proposals of 2 days ago were quite unacceptable but neither he nor Goering tcolc such a serious view as Ribbentrop&apos;s staff..Goering said that Hitler had said to him&apos; &quot;If I can settle the Sudeten question with Britain the British will be surprised at the moderation of my suggestions for an Anglo-German understanding&quot;.Goering also tried to impress me with the strength of the German economic as well as military position.    But he certainly does not contemplate war this month,  and he is the frankest of the lot.I believe Hitler will say on Monday.    &quot;If Runciman cannot find a solution at Prague acceptable to the Sudeten,  then I shall have to&quot;.
