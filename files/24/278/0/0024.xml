Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1938.SECRET. CP. 189 (38).CABINET.EGYPT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Cabinet will remember that at the last meeting before the holidays I was authorised to accept in principle the offer of the Egyptian Prime Minister regarding the building of barracks in the Canal Zone, provided that certain subsidiary questions (including the liabilities of the Egyptians in respect to the satellite civilian town which might be expected to arise in the vicinity of the troops&apos; cantonments) were satisfactorily dealt with, and that satisfactory assurances could be obtained from the Prime Minister both in regard to the Alexandria port scheme and in regard to the complaints of the Lancashire cotton industry against certain increases made last April in the Egyptian duties on cotton imports.The subsidiary questions were dealt with to the satisfaction of the Depart-ments concerned in the Protocol and its Agreed Minute, initialled on the 4th August, of which I append copies (Annex I). In the revised text of the appropriate paragraph of the Treaty the Egyptian liability for various costly items is clearly defined, including their responsibility in regard to the civilian town. In the Agreed Minute three important points are obtained for His Majesty&apos;s Government. First, the Egyptians are tied to accept all the categories covered by the estimates presented by them on the 10th May, 1938. Secondly, they are tied to accept the new requirements of the Royal Air Force, which entail an increase of approximately  2,050,000, of which they have been informed, though the details have not yet been submitted to them. Thirdly, it is secured that the Egyptian Government will permit, at the request of the appropriate British authority, the erection and use for the period of the British forces&apos; occupation, of buildings for commercial purposes, such as hotels and shops, by private enterprise, or the development of grounds for market gardening.The assurances as regards the Alexandria port development are embodied in a draft of two notes, to be exchanged between the Egyptian Prime Minister on his return to Egypt and His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires, the texts of which were initialled on the 4th August at the same time as the Protocol and Agreed Minute. The substantial point in this exchange of notes is that the Egyptian Prime Minister will inform the British Charge d&apos;Affaires that his Government intend to proceed with the port works and will request for this purpose the loan of a dredger.  A copy of the two draft notes is also attached (Annex II).As regards the cotton negotiations, the Egyptian Prime Minister said he was unable to make any statement to the Lancashire delegates until he could consult his colleagues, and especially the Minister for Finance, but he invited the Lancashire delegates to visit him in Egypt immediately after his return early in September, and he confidentially informed me that a reduction of the duties, possibly to their original level, would be an easy matter and that the question of quotas was being sympathetically studied, although he confessed that he had never liked the idea of quotas himself.I think the assurances as regards the Alexandria port scheme and (though to a lesser degree) in regard to cotton are as favourable as could reasonably be10014   [17733]Copy No.
2expected. Apart, however, from these very important considerations, there would, in my judgment, have been a very strong case on political, military and financial grounds for accepting the Egyptian Prime Minister&apos;s proposal in regard to the building under the Treaty, even if he had not spontaneously offered to do his utmost to carry through the Alexandria port scheme. Indeed, when all the factors are examined, it is extremely difficult to see how the Treaty building question could have been settled otherwise, if only because a reversion to the 1936 offer, as is plain from all the reports received from Egypt, would have been repudiated by the Opposition leaders who had taken part in the signature of the 1936 Treaty. They had rejected the original offer and have been contending violently in Egypt that Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha had no mandate to agree to any such drastic revision of the Treaty. The Opposition will no doubt endeavour to criticise Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha&apos;s achievement, but I am advised that they will find it difficult to do this effectively, unless they can succeed in proving that there is a connexion between the solution of the Treaty building difficulty and the decision to proceed with the Alexandria port works. By the procedure he has adopted, Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha thought that he would be able to resist such attack as might be expected on this ground.H.Foreign Office, August 11, 1938.ANNEX I.Protocol.HIS Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and His Majesty the King of Egypt;Whereas the Egyptian Government have represented that the cost of the provision of accommodation for the British forces in the zone in the vicinity of the Suez Canal, in accordance with the provisions of the annex to article 8 of the Treaty of Alliance, signed at London on the 26th August, 1936, has now been discovered to be greater than that estimated by the Egyptian Government at the time of the signature of the treaty, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should make a greater financial contribution thereto than that at present laid down in the said annex; andWhereas His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, animated by their constant desire to collaborate with their ally, are willing, subject to the approval of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, to increase their financial contribution;Have decided to conclude an agreement amending the provisions of the said annex in this respect; andHave accordingly appointed as their plenipotentiaries for this purpose : His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India : For Great Britain and Northern Ireland:His Majesty the King of Egypt :Who, having communicated their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed as follows :-Article .1.The following provisions shall be substituted for paragraph 4 of the annex to article 8 of the Treaty of Alliance signed between the high contracting parties at London on the 26th August, 1936.&apos;Paragraph 4.The Egyptian Government will make available the lands and construct the accommodation, water supplies, amenities and convalescent camp referred to in the preceding paragraph as being necessary over and above  he accommodation

ANNEX II.Draft of Letter from Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha to His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Cairo.AS you are aware, the Egyptian Government has had in contemplation for some years a scheme for the improvement of the existing accommodation for vessels using the port of Alexandria for commercial purposes, including a dock [of 1,000 feet in length by 135 feet in width with 40 feet over the sill], break-water and quay, and for the reception of ships of deeper draught by deepening the Great Pass to a depth of 40 feet. It is also realised that such improvement would be of great strategic importance in the event of war. I have now decided to proceed with this improvement as soon as possible, and my Govern-ment intends to submit to Parliament in the budget for next year proposals for carrying it into effect forthwith.The scheme will involve extensive dredging operations for which my Govern-ment is unfortunately insufficiently equipped, having only one dredger of the type required. We are therefore obliged to make all necessary arrangements to supplement the deficiency and to enable the dredging to be carried out with the required rapidity. But before doing so, and having learnt that the British Government might be in a position to assist us with the loan of a suitable dredger, as was done, I understand, when other works of deepening this harbour were undertaken in 1905-7, I would be greatly obliged if you would let me know whether the British Government will have a suitable dredger available in the early summer of next year.Draft of Letter from His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Cairo to Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha.I have considered the question of the loan of the dredger which you raised in your letter of to me.  My Government have not at the momentany suitable dredger in their possession, but had recently decided to construct one for their own fleet of the type required for the use in contemplation. It is hoped that arrangements can be made for this dredger to be completed by the autumn of next year. My Government, anxious to assist you in the prompt execution of a scheme which would be of strategic importance in the event of war, will be pleased to lend this dredger to the Egyptian Government under the same terms as were approved in 1905.
