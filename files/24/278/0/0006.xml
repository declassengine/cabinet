THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1938.SECRET Copy No.CP. 171 (38).CABINET.GERMAN ATTITUDE TOWARDS EVENTS IN SPAIN and portugal.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will remember that on the 7th July I circulated as CP. 163 (38) the text of a translation of General von Reichenau&apos;s lecture at Leipzig. This lecture was published in the News Chronicle of the 12th July, and has also been referred to in several French newspapers. No doubt as a result of this publicity the German Ambassador called at the Foreign Office yesterday to deny the authenticity of the document. I enclose below the record of Herr von Dirksen&apos;s conversation with Sir A. Cadogan.H.July 14, 1938.Record of Conversation bettveen the Germ.an Ambassador and, Sir A. Cadogan.THE German Ambassador told me this morning that his attention had been drawn yesterday to the article in the News Chronicle containing an alleged account of a speech made by a German General. This article had caused some sensation, and he had telegraphed the gist of it to his Government with an enquiry as to whether there was any truth in it whatever. He had now received a reply from Berlin to the effect that the whole thing could be categorically denied and that the German Government were issuing a formal dementi.The Ambassador added that when he first read the article he could not help feeling that it was a forgery, as in the first place it contained various inaccuracies, of which he cited the reference to the possibility of a Pan-Iberian movement, and also because anyone who knew anything at all about the manner in which things were conducted in Germany would know that it would be quite impossible for any German General to make such a speech to Party leaders.I told the Ambassador I would at once bring what he had told me to the notice of the Secretary of State.A. C.July 13, 1938.9961   [17570]
