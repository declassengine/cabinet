INTERDEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON M. van ZEELAND S REPORT.REPORT.I. TERMS OF  REFERENCE.   &apos;1. WE were appointed by the Prime Minister on the 18th February, 1938, to examine M. van Zeeland&apos;s Report (published as Command Paper 5648), together with the Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Trade Policy (C.T.P. (37) 11), which reported oh the 7th June, 1937.2. It may be convenient to recall that the terms of reference of that Interdepartmental Committee Avere &quot; to consider our economic policy in the light of the changes in the economic situation and the international political situation since 1932,&quot; with particular reference to the following questions: Imperial Preference, Quotas, Tariffs, the &quot; Open Door &quot; in the Colonies, the possibility of German devaluation, and Japanese competition in the Colonies. The question of Imperial Preference is being dealt with in its most practical form in connection with the negotiations for a Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States, and we have therefore given no detailed consideration to it  though it is worthy of note that M. van Zeeland placed a very high value upon the successful outcome of those negotiations. The questions of abstaining from measures in the event of a possible German devaluation or of relaxing steps which have been taken to counteract Japanese competition in the Colonies, do not appear at present to be practical issues. On the other hand, the views expressed by the Committee on the remaining questions Tariffs, Quotas, and the &quot; Open Door &quot; in the Colonies have been re-examined by us in the light of the Van Zeeland Report and of the current situation in the world.3. In our discussions we have had the benefit of the assistance of Sir Horace Wilson, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., C.B.E. We have not had occasion to co-opt repre-sentatives of the Dominions Office and India Office, but we have consulted those Departments before finally settling the terms of our Report.II. GENERAL INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.4. From the outset of our enquiry, certain members of the Committee have expressed doubts as to the possibility of progress in the economic sphere in advance of political appeasement. Recent events in Europe, more particularly the disappearance of Austria as a separate entity, have strengthened those doubts. The fundamental difficulty in the way of securing closer international collabora-tion on economic and financial questions is that the totalitarian States have deliberately adopted a policy of self-sufficiency for political and military as much as for economic reasons, and they will not easily be deflected from this policy unless the democratic countries are prepared to offer them very substantial inducements. In any case, these latter countries cannot do so without adequate guarantees that the assistance thus provided will not be used by the totalitarian States mainly to strengthen their military position. At the present moment neither of these conditions appears capable of fulfilment.5. We are bound to recognise that, in these circumstances, progress on the lines of the Van Zeeland Report may not be practicable, at any rate in the immediate future. We have, however, considered it our duty to examine, on their merits and in accordance with our terms of&apos;reference, M. van Zeeland&apos;s Report and the relevant recommendations in the Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Trade Policy. It will be for Ministers to determine whether or not progress can be made under existing conditions.6.   We have accordingly taken the recommendations in these two Reports and considered to what extent it would be possible for the United Kingdom to [17321] B 2
accept them. We have attempted, in particular, to see which of the recom-mendations could be accepted with little or no damage to our financial and economic interests, and could therefore be recommended for acceptance, without any substantial counter-concessions being required. We recognise that in an atmosphere of political appeasement and in return for adequate concessions by other Governments it might be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to review the situation from a broader standpoint and to consider more radical action by the United Kingdom.III.-METHOD OF EXAMINATION.7. Our Report is based in the main upon an examination of those recom-mendations of the Interdepartmental Committee which are relevant to our inquiry, followed by an examination of the recommendations in the Second Part of M. van Zeeland&apos;s Report, which deals with the.principal direct obstacles in the way of international trade and the means of reducing them. It must be noted that the recommendations of the Interdepartmental Committee to which we refer are confined to the economic sphere, whereas those of M. van Zeeland relate both to the economic and financial spheres. We have also certain comments to make on M. van Zeeland&apos;s reference to colonial problems as set out on page 47 of his Report. Finally, we deal with the proposal for a &quot; pact of economic collabora-tion,&quot; and with the methods of realisation proposed by M. van Zeeland.8. Owing to the numerous and complicated issues involved in such an examination, we have thought it as well to annex, in the form of appendices to our Report, memoranda by certain of the Departments concerned. So far as these appendices are concerned, the Report itself does not attempt to do more than summarise them and to indicate the conclusions reached by the Committee on the basis of the evidence before them.IY.-ECONOMIC SPHERE.TARIFFS.Recommendations of the Interdepartmental Committee on Trade Policy.9. The Interdepartmental Committee, when it considered the United Kingdom tariff in relation to international possibilities of economic appeasement in June 1937, came to the conclusion that this country had no need to feel appre-hension at some further expansion of its imports of manufactured goods, and that there was no reason to take special measures to check such expansion. They felt, accordingly, that there was something to be gained in the international sphere by announcing in advance the policy which it was intended to adopt in this respect. They felt too that, in the improved circumstances since the United Kingdom tariff was introduced, the time had come when certain of our duties might be reviewed in order that the possibilities of reducing existing duties might be ascertained.10.   The Committee on Trade Policy recommended accordingly that (i) His Majesty&apos;s Government should inform the Import Duties Advisory Committee, and at the same time announce, that for the time being they would feel it difficult to accept recommendations for new or increased duties unless justified by very special considerations;(ii) the Import Duties Advisory Committee should be requested to examineall duties imposed to counteract specific cases of subsidised competition with a view to their reduction if such special competition had been discontinued;(iii) the Import Duties Advisory Committee should be requested to undertake a review of all protective duties with a view to satisfying themselves that the industries concerned had taken all possible steps to secure the maximum of efficiency;(iv) we should be prepared to reduce our duties as a result of trade negotiations, in the course of which we ourselves received adequate concessions.
M. van Zeeland&apos;s Recommendations.11. M. van Zeeland includes tariffs among the three prejudicial factors in the economic sphere, i.e., tariffs, methods of indirect protection and quotas. M. van Zeeland recognises, of course, that the existence of a tariff is not of itself one of the most serious obstacles to international trade, but he says that there are certain exaggerations of the tariff system which are particularly harmful. He recommends that what is necessary in order to remove the most prejudicial features of existing tariff systems&apos;is that Governments should undertake, by means, if necessary, of parallel declarations -(i) not to raise their tariffs or widen their range;(ii) gradually to reduce such duties as are of an exceptional character and the amount of which is notably greater than the average incidence of the tariff.12. It will be seen that M. van Zeeland&apos;s first recommendation is very much on the same lines as those of the Interdepartmental Committee on Trade Policy, but that his second recommendation goes further in suggesting a systematic reduction of specially high duties. He does not, however, suggest that this should be done at a stroke, but indicates that what he calls filing down the sharp points of the tariff could be spread over a certain number of years. He also recognises elsewhere in his Report that a country has the right to protect itself energetically against dumping methods.Possibilities of action by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Tariffs on industrial goods.13. If we examine first the possibilities so far as our duties on industrial goods are concerned, we find that the Interdepartmental Committee pointed out in June last that the Import Duties Advisory Committee had recommended in the previous twelve months only comparatively minor alterations in the United Kingdom tariff. In fact, all that the Committee have found it necessary to do since December 1935, apart from a few reductions of duty and minor adjustments, has been to recommend the imposition, increase or maintenance of specific duties in order to give protection against abnormally cheap imports from certain foreign countries. Appendix I to this Report reviews the Import Duties Additional Orders and Exemptions Orders made since December 1935. It can be admitted that some of the specific duties which are directed against Japanese goods have a very high ad valorem incidence on such goods, but these duties would appear to be covered by M. van Zeeland&apos;s reservations regarding anti-dumping measures.14. The conclusion which we have reached is that, so far as industrial goods are concerned, our tariff has reached a general level of an appropriate character, and that there would be probably little danger in giving an undertaking not to increase it, save in order to meet exceptional conditions. The question whether such an undertaking should be made unilaterally is examined later.As regards the reduction of exceptional duties, most of the duties in the highest ranges have been imposed to check excessively cheap imports, but so long as it is understood that appropriate duties can be maintained to meet those cases, there would be no reason why the Import Duties Advisory Committee should not be asked to review such duties. In some cases where high duties were imposed to meet exceptional conditions, conditions may since have changed in such a way as to permit some reduction in the duties.Tariffs on agricultural goods.15. Any undertaking not to raise or widen the range of our tariffs on agricultural goods would be open to the objection that it would preclude action against foreign imports of eggs, poultry and of some kinds of fruit and vegetables for which tariffs at present provide the sole means of assistance. Since agriculture has to be regarded as a vital industry from the point of view of national defence, such an undertaking might mean that other forms of protection, such as quantitative regulation or Exchequer subsidies, might have to be employed. It should, moreover, be noted that an undertaking not to raise duties on foreign eggs and dairy produce would, owing to the preference at present guaranteed or offered until August. 1940, inevitably reduce our bargaining power vis-a-vis
certain of the Dominions. On the other hand, the extent to which the United Kingdom Government would wish to use such powers would in all probability be strictly limited by the need to prevent any substantial increase in the cost of living, and it should not be difficult for us to subscribe to some agreement fixing the maximum duties on staple agricultural products at a level lower than those in force in most foreign countries.16. The only high duty which we have on a staple agricultural product is the duty on oats, and this, in fact, now benefits the Canadian more than the home producer. Apart from this case, we have some high duties on certain flowers, fruit and vegetables which are of a seasonal character, and the gradual reduction of these duties and/or of the general ad valorem duty would be considerably more difficult unless (a) it was offset by the adoption of some other equivalent form of protection, or (6) it was carried out in return for concessions by other countries. Equivalent protection.would presumably take the form of either quotas or subsidies or both, and the imposition of additional quotas might not be welcome, while the extension of the system of protective subsidies might turn out to be equally objectionable.. 17. The cases in which agricultural duties could perhaps be most easily reduced would be those in which protection is at present afforded both by quotas and by duties, e.g., processed milks, white fish and herrings, and potatoes. It is quite Certain, however, that there would be strong objection from home producers to the removal or reduction of the duties in these cases, and that almost inevitably such action would involve a tightening up of such quotas as have not normally been filled. Moreover it must be remembered that, as regards processed milks, the present quotas, which are on a voluntary basis, were imposed in lieu of the substantial increase in the duties that had been recommended by the Import Duties Advisory Committee, and that, as regards fish, the fishing industry is suffering from acute depression.Possibility of unilateral measxires by His Majesty&apos;s Government. &apos; . 18. The Interdepartmental . Committee on Trade Policy considering the question in the circumstances of last summer had in mind that unilateral action by this country might well have a favourable influence on the policy of other countries, and further that such action might also be in our own national interest. They pointed in their Report to the adverse effects on Germany, Italy and Japan, of our policy of protection and Imperial Preference, which, however it may be justified, has certainty tended to throw these three Powers together as companions in distress into what may be a formidable combination. They had in mind, further, that if European countries could obtain the foreign exchange necessary to finance their increasing imports of raw materials by exports of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods to the United Kingdom arid the British Empire, they would be less likely to pursue policies, e.g., of exchange restrictions, of subsidising exports, or of producing substitute materials, which react on our trade interests.19. Again, the improvement of our internal trade had caused the prices of United Kingdom manufactures to rise and thus rendered their sale abroad more difficult. The Committee were influenced by the consideration that, as we depend so vitally on our export trade any increase in the protection afforded to our industries would ori balance be undesirable, and that in the-interests of our own economy His Majesty&apos;s Government might take unilateral action to restrict increases of tariffs in the future. Accordingly, they recommended that the Import Duties Advisory Committee should be invited to make recommendations only in very special cases, and that an appropriate announcement should be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government.20. This recommendation has not been overlooked. It was decided, however, by the President of the Board of Trade (in connexion with a recommendation by the Import Duties Advisory Committee for an increased duty on carpets) that such a unilateral announcement would not strengthen the movement for the reduction of trade barriers, but would, indeed, merely strengthen the hands of those who doubted the necessity for such a policy. Speaking in the House of Commons on the 24th May last the President said that the United Kingdom could not any longer afford to make unilateral gestures in trade matters just as gestures
-of goodwill. In fact, the machinery of the Import Duties Advisory Committee has been devised in order to relieve the Government of the direct responsibility for dealing with claims for increased protection, and it is important to avoid action which would undermine the authority of the Committee and transfer consideration of such claims to Parliament. The recession in trade which has developed since the Interdepartmental Committee reported does not in our opinion justify any modification of their view that our tariff taken as a whole has reached an appropriate level, but it would undoubtedly tend to increase Parlia-mentary pressure on the Government if they took action which appeared to limit the powers of the Import Duties Advisory Committee. We understand that the members of the Import Duties Advisory Committee are, in fact, alive to the danger of any all-round increase in tariffs, and they have indicated, informally, that if they should be faced with widespread claims for increased protection, they will be prepared to consult the Government as to what action would be advisable. They prefer that there should be no formal instruction to them and, in the circumstances, no such instruction appears necessary.21. As to the recommendation of the Interdepartmental Committee that all our protective duties should be reviewed (irrespective of what other countries; may do) to ensure that protection is not used to bolster up inefficient industries, there is the standing difficulty of deciding what is efficiency. In any case the key industry duties would have to be excluded from any such review, as they have been specially examined by an ad hoc committee, whose decisions were governed by considerations of defence. The Import Duties Advisory Committee have given special attention to the efficiency of the iron and steel industry, but in practice their attention has inevitably been focussed more on price arrangements than on anything else. Hitherto the iron and steel industry have maintained the position that the greatest possible output of Iron and steel is necessary, and that to attain that end prices must be so arranged as to keep the least efficient producer working. It is, in fact, extremely difficult, even for the Import Duties Advisory Committee, who have better facilities and greater authority for this purpose than anyone else, to satisfy themselves as to the efficiency of an industry or to do anything to make it efficient other than recommending that the protection accorded should be made dependent on the industry setting its house in order.22. In reviewing the functions of the Import Duties Advisory Committee there arises the question whether the Committee can in practice effectively have regard, as they are required to do by the terms of the Import Duties Act, &quot; to the interests of trades and industries which are consumers of goods as well as those of trades and industries which are producers of goods.&quot; Consuming industries, while ready enough to complain of the effects of the protection enjoyed by other industries, are generally reluctant to sustain these complaints before the Import Duties Advisory Committee, no doubt because they fear that it may react on their own position if at any time they may put forward a claim for protection themselves. In fact, unless the importers are strongly organised, the consumer often does not secure direct representation before, the Committee at all, and it is by no means clear how such representation can be arranged. Thus the Import Duties Advisory Committee tend to receive many more claims for increases than for reductions, of protective duties, and the arguments in favour of an increase are usually more fully and carefully presented than the arguments that can be advanced against it. It has, therefore, depended mainly on.the judgment of the members of the Import Duties Advisory Committee themselves how much weight to attach to the interests of consuming industries.. 23. On both these questions therefore, viz., the encouragement of greater efficiency and the representation of consuming interests, the machinery of the Import Duties Advisory Committee cannot be said to be wholly effective. We see, however, no immediate remedy for these defects, and we think &quot;that the Committee must be relied upon to safeguard the position so far as they can do so.Diffictdties of tariff reductions on a multilateral basis.24. It must be confessed that the likelihood of. other countries making-unilateral gestures in the tariff sphere is very small. On the other hand, multi-lateral negotiations to reduce trade barriers have been attempted before, and have not led to fruitful results.   The examples furnished by the Tariff Truce Negotia-
lions of 1930, and the Monetary and Economic Conference of 1933, spring to mind. The problem of devising a common formula under which a number of countries could proceed to the gradual lowering of their tariffs has hitherto defied all ingenuity; countries always say that such formulae are unacceptable because, owing to the differences in their respective situations, a &quot; uniform mechanical formula &quot; would work inequitably; for example, each country&apos;s tariff differs from that of other countries, both in the types and heights of its duties and in its tariff classification. If, on the other hand, a large number of countries attempt to negotiate simultaneously without a. common formula, they will at once find that no single tariff rate in any given country affects more than two or three others.25. This experience suggests that the time spent in trying to negotiate duty reductions with many countries at once, with the practical certainty that nothing substantial will be achieved, might be more effectively utilised in bilateral negotiations. None the less, we recognise that, if other countries are prepared to attempt a negotiation on a multilateral basis, His Majesty&apos;s Government would have no ground for refusing to participate, more particularly as any wide relaxation of economic barriers (especially quotas) appears to be dependent on multilateral action.Bilateral Agreements.26. M. van Zeeland himself recommends, as one of the most efficacious methods of reducing tariff barriers, the negotiation of bilateral commercial agreements a procedure which he says has produced indisputable results. This recommendation accords with that of the Interdepartmental Committee on Trade Policy that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be prepared to reduce United Kingdom duties as a result of trade negotiations in the course of which they themselves received adequate concessions.27. It is indeed the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government have pursued and which they regard as an important contribution to the revival of international trade. It is, too, the conclusion reached by the Government of the United States. In the memorandum of February last in which they expressed their readiness to receive M. van Zeeland again, they pointed to the method of bilateral negotiation (on the basis of unconditional most-favoured-nation treatment for those countries which practise a non-discriminatory policy) as one of M. van Zeeland&apos;s recommendations which offers good prospects of fruitful results, and in their memorandum of the 2nd June they have again stressed the value of bilateral agreements in the present circumstances of international tension.28. A note on what has been achieved by means of bilateral negotiations is included in Appendix II to this Report and we assume that His Majesty&apos;s Government will continue to pursue such negotiations as and when possible.Group Agreements.29. M. van Zeeland refers to criticisms of the most-favoured-nation clause. He endorses the proposition that the clause should remain, in principle, general and unconditional (except where inadmissible discrimination is practised by a third country or a country refuses to collaborate in a policy of international tariff reduction), but he advocates an exception in favour of group agreements or regional pacts which satisfy certain conditions. A note on the subject will be found in Appendix II to this Report. It is shown that the difficulty about such pacts from our own point of view (and equally, no doubt, from the point of view of other countries whose trade interests are spread fairly evenly over a wide field) is the dilemma with which they confront us. Either we join a particular group and are obliged to discriminate against non-members and expose ourselves to retaliation or we stay outside and lose trade with the members of the group. Moreover, membership of such a group with its preferential regime introduces complications in the light of our own inter-Empire preferences.Apart from these difficulties in the way of our joining such groups, it must be borne in mind that regional pacts might have important political consequences, for example, the subordination of China to Japan, or of the Danubian countries to Germany.
30. It is true that on the initiative of the United States an Agreement, the so-called Washington or Montevideo Agreement to which further reference is made in Appendix II was opened for signature at Washington in July 1934, which provided that the parties to the Agreement would not, in their relations with one another, invoke the obligations of the most-favoured-nation clause for the purpose of obtaining the benefits resulting from multilateral agreements, provided that such agreements were of general application, that they related to a trade area of substantial size and that they were open to adoption .by all countries. The Government of the United States ratified the Agreement, but their spokesmen have since on many occasions emphasised that their Governments policy is that of unconditional most-favoured-nation treatment for countries which reciprocate. It is, indeed, most unlikely that the United States would accept a derogation from their most-favoured-nation rights in favour of a low tariff arrangement which involved them in any material sacrifice.QUOTAS. I. Industrial Quotas31. M. van Zeeland regards quotas as one of the most formidable obstacles to international trade. He accordingly recommends their suppression, although their suppression might, he says, be prolonged where necessary over a fairly long period and they could be replaced by tariffs or, if it was absolutely necessary and for a temporary period, by duty-quotas. Further, he recognises the serious problem constituted by competition from countries with low standards of living and he feels that in strictly defined cases, protective measures may be necessary in order that time may be given for the necessary adjustments.32. So far as the suppression of industrial quotas is concerned, there is no difficulty for this country since we have no such quotas. It must be remembered that the arrangements governing the import of iron and steel products into this country do not involve any direct limitation of the quantity of such products which may be imported. Up to a certain quantity they are allowed in at a reduced rate of duty. Above that limit there is no restriction of imports, but a higher rate of duty is charged. Moreover, the iron and steel arrangements were instituted to enable effect to be given to an international cartel agreement, and M. van Zeeland recognises that such agreements may well be to the general interest.II. Agricultural Quotas.Recommendations of the Inter-departmental Committee on Trade Policy.33. On the subject of quotas the Inter-departmental Committee referred to the fact that quota restrictions imposed by European countries had severely hampered United Kingdom exports and that if we continued to urge the removal of those restrictions, we must expect to find ourselves increasingly pressed in return to remove our quotas. They examined in particular the bacon quota as being the most important.34. They recognised that the bacon quota worked reasonably well in practice and that the protection which it afforded to the home producer had proved less injurious to his foreign competitor than a levy-subsidy or a tariff would have been. They felt, on the other hand, that if the retention of the bacon quota seriously prejudiced the success of international negotiations for the general removal of trade barriers, including the removal of quotas, and if a suitable alternative could be found (e.g., assistance by way of levy subsidy) we should offer in any such negotiations to remove the quota, provided that foreign countries entitled to free entry agreed to its replacement by an appropriate tariff * It was subsequently decided by His Majesty&apos;s Government that the levy could not be adopted and that the quota system should be maintained accompanied temporarily by a subsidy to the home producer.* It will be seen from Appendix III that it does not appear very likely, from the experience in attempting to negotiate a relaxation of the bacon quota on the basis of the substitution of a levy, that an offer to substitute a tariff for the bacon &apos;quota would be likely to meet with approval among the main bacon supplying countries.
M. van Zeeland&apos;s Recommendations.35. M. van Zeelancl recognises that agricultural quotas have of ten a special character of their own which distinguishes them from industrial quotas, but he recommends that in the agricultural as in the industrial sphere, the tendency should be in the direction of suppression or reduction. At any rate, he says, agreement ought to be reached that no new quotas should be imposed and that no existing quotas should be tightened up.36. M. van Zeeland recognises the justification for two exceptions, i.e., in respect of (a) quotas affecting seasonal or perishable products, where the restrictionis directed to the orderly spreading of importations over the year and not to an absolute quantitative limitation, and(b) quotas which in exceptional circumstances it may be necessary tomaintain temporarily in order to take account of conditions peculiar to agricultural production, particularly the difficulty of restricting production at a given moment. In such cases, transitional measures may prove necessary and proper, pending a fundamental solution of the problem of production.Possibilities of action by His Majesty&apos;s Government.37. The question of what is the fundamental solution of the problem of production would raise very difficult and debateable issues, and we have therefore confined ourselves to examining the repercussions of M. van Zeeland&apos;s recommendations on United Kingdom policy. There is attached to this Report a joint memorandum (Appendix III) by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Board of Trade on the subject of our agricultural quotas. Those Departments stress that it would not be possible to take action of the kind envisaged by M. van Zeeland without a complete departure from the Government&apos;s declared policy on a large number of agricultural products. It is suggested that there are two alternative courses open to us. The first is to maintain our existing scheme of quotas and to justify them, as we have hitherto done, as deriving from principles quite different from those which govern the industrial quotas which we condemn. It could be argued that as protection for United Kingdom agriculture is essential, and as we do not impose duties on the great majority of Empire agricultural products, protection can only be given by quantitative control of imports. The second alternative would be to explain that our aim is to safeguard or stabilise agriculture by means of regulatory quotas, which have only a moderate protective and preferential aspect, and to undertake a review of existing quotas in order to see that they accord with this principle. Under this alternative some relaxation of the bacon quota might be involved and much tightening up of the fish quotas might be precluded. An exception would have to be made in the case of the processed milks quota. Reference is made in the joint memorandum to the possibility of substituting for quotas determined by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment international market control by producers themselves on the lines of the International Beef Conference.38. It must, of course, be recognised that the arguments put forward for distinguishing agricultural from industrial quotas are not necessarily acceptable to foreigners, and that if the United Kingdom system of agricultural quotas is in the main to be retained, it will be more difficult to persuade European countries (and particularly the agrarian countries of East and South-East Europe) to abandon their industrial and agricultural quotas and to this extent our own exports to Europe and those of the Dominions, who are finding themselves obliged to seek outlets in Europe, will continue to suffer.EXPORT DUTIES AND PROHIBITIONS.39. M. van Zeeland recommends the suppression of duties, taxes, prohibi-tions or restrictions affecting the export of raw materials. He suggests, however, that the suppression of restrictive measures with regard to exports need not imply the complete suppression of duties, so long as their effect did not in any way injure the general economic interests of importers.
40. There are no such duties or restrictions on exports from the United Kingdom so that an undertaking not to introduce such restrictions could easily be given subject to a reservation in respect of national emergency. It seems safe to assume that M. van Zeeland would not condemn the voluntary restriction on exports which is carried out by overseas countries in connexion with the regulation of agricultural imports into the United Kingdom.41. So far as the British Colonies are concerned the principal restriction on the export of raw material is the export duty on tin ore shipped to foreign countries from Malaya and Nigeria : but as this duty is imposed solely to safe-guard the local refineries and there is no export duty on refined tin which is what the consumer needs this duty could not be regarded as injuring the general economic interests of consumers. Other duties or restrictions are either purely revenue duties or imposed in pursuance of regulation schemes and are not open to criticism.42. M. van Zeeland refers to the restrictive interpretation of regulations and abusive administrative practices, and, in particular, to the abuse of sanitary regulations. He,.refers further to the exaggeration of the detail of tariffs. A note by the Board of Trade arid the Ministry of Agriculture on the specific recommendations of M. van Zeeland is attached (Appendix IV). While there seems that there can be little complaint against the United Kingdom on the score of administrative abuse or exaggerated tariff specifications, the restrictions imposed on sanitary grounds have been a fruitful ^source of complaint by some foreign countries. In Appendix IV it is stressed that the United Kingdom regulations, though severe, have as their sole purpose the prevention of the importation of disease. Emphasis is laid on the importance of retaining power to impose such restrictions wherever they are considered necessary, and the reasons are given why in cases of complaint by foreign countries submission to an outside arbitral body is unacceptable.43. The refusal to accept arbitration is, unfortunately, always liable to be regarded by other countries as conclusive evidence that the sanitary measures adopted are not capable of justification before an impartial tribunal and are, therefore, instances of indirect protection. We assume, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not be willing to modify the policy hitherto adopted in this matter.44. The objections to the adoption of the Geneva tariff nomenclature are of a more technical character. Our present tariffs are certainly very complicated and their codification would be desirable, but there would be considerable difficulties in fitting them into the Geneva nomenclature and elaborate legislation would be necessary.45. It appears therefore that, while we can endorse the principles laid down by M. van Zeeland, we cannot adopt his specific suggestions either as to sanitary regulations or as to the adoption of the Geneva tariff nomenclature. On the other matters referred to by M. van Zeeland, the practice of the United Kingdom is satisfactory.46. In Section B of the Second Part of his Report M. van Zeeland states that in his opinion the principal obstacles to international trade, in the financial sphere, are monetary disturbances (i.e., either sudden or violent variations in the mutual relations of currencies or mere uncertainty), and restrictions regarding the transfer of capital or of commercial payments. On page 38 et seq. he proceeds to make suggestions for dealing with these obstacles. A memorandum by the Treasury on this section of the Report will be found in Appendix V.INDIRECT PROTECTION.Y.-FINANCIAL SPHERE.General.
Currency.47. M. van Zeeland&apos;s first suggestion is that, as an interim solution pending any attempt at a restoration of an international gold standard, there should be a revision and extension of the Tripartite Agreement. He contemplates a definition of parities and a pledge to keep variations within certain limits. He suggests that, subject to force majeure, the duration of such an Agreement should be for one year or at least for six months.48. The Treasury point out that this proposal, involving as it might an undertaking to maintain artificial parities for as long as twelve months, is not practicable. We note, however, that the Treasury would favour some amendment of the existing Agreement designed to give it a greater appearance of stability. Presumably tne first step would be to open discussions with the United States and French Governments, but the variability of the franc it has fallen from 75 to the   to 178 to the   as the result of repeated crises in the last eighteen months suggests that more experience is needed of the arrangements recently made by the French Government before the opening of any such discussions could be contemplated. We recommend, however, that the subject should not be lost sight of and should be considered as soon as circumstances permit. It is doubtful if any useful purpose would be served by general monetary discussions with Germany and Italy. The whole basis of the Tripartite Agreement is that it is between countries with free exchanges and the time does not appear to be ripe for opening negotiations with Germany and Italy on the basis that they will abolish their systems of exchange control.Foreign Lending.49. M. van Zeeland&apos;s next recommendation is that there should be a relaxation of prohibitions and restrictions in creditor markets. In that con-nection, an important change in this country&apos;s policy in regard to foreign lending was announced in the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 1st February, 1938, which goes a considerable way to meet M. van Zeeland&apos;s criticisms so far as the United Kingdom is concerned, and we see no reason to recommend going further than that statement.External Debts and Clearing Arrears.50. The Report then recommends (a) an agreed adjustment of external debts weighing heavily on debtor countries, and (b) the settlement of clearing arrears by consolidation of old credits and the liquidation of more recent liabilities on the same basis as current debts. Action in the sense of the first of these proposals is primarily a matter between debtor and creditor. In this country the Council of Foreign Bondholders constantly undertakes negotiations on behalf of the creditors, and has arrived at a number of settlements with debtor countries. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, it may, therefore, be said that the policy recommended by M. van Zeeland on this point is already in operation. As regards the second proposal, there are considerable technical objections to M. van Zeeland&apos;s proposals, but the United Kingdom is not directly concerned. We have only three clearings in operation and none of them is faced with such substantial arrears as to call for consolidation.Reciprocal Credits.51. To assist those countries willing to contemplate the abolition of exchange restrictions and able to liquidate the past in the manner described in the preceding paragraph, it is proposed by M. van Zeeland that Banks of Issue should open reciprocal credits in favour of one another through the Bank for Interna-tional Settlements. Here again we are not much concerned, but it is doubtful if the proposal would be of more than limited usefulness. To a certain extent, finance would be driven into arbitrary and inexperienced channels, and it might be more satisfactory to consider the opening for this purpose of, say, the London market, with its wealth of experience&apos;.- As the Treasury memorandum points out, certain details in M. van Zeeland&apos;s proposals will require further elucidation before any firm opinion can be expressed- upon them, e.g., his reference to the forward exchange market for the purpose of settling the balances of credits. We understand that the views of the Bank for&apos; International Settlements are being-invited on these proposals.
VI. REFERENCES TO THE COLONIES.53. In Section B (2) of the Third Part of his Report M. van Zeeland makes certain references to the colonies which it will be convenient to examine at this stage. The Committee observe that in this section M. van Zeeland does not appear to make recommendations he merely notes certain of the suggestions made to him.International A dministration of mandated territories.54. The first suggestion is that the administration of mandated territories should be made international. So far as we are aware, there is no evidence that such a step would have any beneficial influence on the economic situation. The provisions of the Mandates are, in general, so drawn as to preclude the Mandatory from obtaining any economic advantage from his position, and the trade statistics of at any rate British mandated territories show that in fact the Mandatory is not deriving any such advantage. On the other hand, a fundamental alteration of this kind in the system of government in these territories would almost certainly lead to grave administrative disadvantages and could not be embarked upon without most careful consideration.&quot; Open Door.&quot;55. The next suggestion made to M. van Zeeland was that the system of the &quot; Colonial Open Door &quot; should be greatly enlarged, and that the system which obtains in the Conventional Basin of the Congo should become general. The Inter-departmental Committee on Trade Policy considered this question last year and recommended against either the application of the full &apos;&apos; Open Door &apos;&apos; regime in the Colonial Empire or a declaration that the United Kingdom would give up any claim to preferences in the Colonial Empire. Instead, they favoured an announcement by His Majesty&apos;s Government that they were willing to consider specific requests for reductions of preferences. The Government approved this proposal, and at the League of Nations Assembly in September, 1937, Mr. Eden announced the readiness of the Government to discuss the abatement of particular preferences in non-self-governing territories in cases where such preferences could be shown to place undue restriction on international trade. Apart from the interest displayed by the United States in this statement and the specific Colonial requests which they have put forward in the course of the trade negotiations now proceeding in Washington, no requests for discussion of Colonial preferences have yet been received.Establishment of a Common Fund.52. Finally, the Report suggests that a Common Fund should be established at the Bank for International Settlements by all the States prepared to join in a programme of international co-operation and be used to facilitate the financing of legitimate trade during the period of adjustment with countries which are prepared to abolish clearings and exchange controls. This proposal contains elements of danger it is doubtful if heavily burdened debtor countries ought to incur further obligations, and the assistance so given might be used to maintain currencies at artificial levels-and it is not likely to elicit much support either from the Bank for International Settlements or from other Governments. In any event, no one would be prepared to back a Common Fund until the necessary internal measures had been taken by the countries concerned. If a practical scheme could be devised, which met these difficulties, and other creditor countries were willing to contribute, this country could hardly refuse to participate. We recommend that the proposal should be further examined by the Treasury in consultation with the Bank of England, but at the present stage we do not see how His Majesty&apos;s Government can do more than promise consideration of any practical scheme that may be submitted. In the past, the most important effort to organise international financial assistance, to a country in difficulties has been represented by the Guaranteed Loans floated for Austria under the auspices of the League of Nations, and the manner in which these Guaranteed Loans may be settled between Germany and the Guarantor States will obviously have an important bearing on this proposal, and, indeed, on all the proposals made by M. van Zeeland for the assistance of debtor countries.
56. The decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this point was arrived at after very full consideration, and we assume that if and when this particular suggestion has to be discussed the attitude of this country will be based on that decision. At any rate, any reconsideration of that decision would hardly be justified unless it appeared that such a concession would exorcise the political demands of Germany for the restoration of her Colonies; and it may be noted that in his speech at Leipzig on the 6th March last Dr. Funk, the German Minister of Economy, declared that &quot; an &apos; Open Door &apos; which someone else can shut again at will is no use to the German people.&apos;&apos;Privileged Companies.57. The third suggestion regarding the creation, for economic purposes, of privileged companies organised on an international basis could apparently only be carried out in regard to territories with large areas of vacant land or as the result of the grant of overriding rights over the natives. In the case of our own Colonial Empire, there are few, if any, large unoccupied areas the most likely area is the south of Tanganyika where the population is sparse and there is therefore little scope for the adoption of the proposal in the British Colonial Empire. The grant to privileged companies of rights over the native inhabitants and their property would be contrary to normal British policy.Raw Materials.58. The exchange of Colonial raw materials as against industrial products is the next suggestion. So far as the British Colonial Empire is concerned, it is difficult to see how any such arrangements could be made. Colonial products are produced by private enterprise in the main, either by native peasant cultivators or by plantation companies, whereas the manufactured goods which it is suggested might be offered in exchange are capital goods required for public works. The proposal would appear to involve either large-scale Government trading in produce or the canalisation and regimentation of trade, both of which would be foreign to the present policy of British Colonial Governments and would be resented by the established merchant interests.59. The object in view could be more simply attained by throwing open to tender all public works in the Colonies, but such action would inevitably give rise to strong criticism from United Kingdom manufacturers, particularly if the capital for the works in question is raised in this country. It might of course be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider such action if it proved an important step towards political appeasement, but there would not appear to be any economic justification for our adopting such proposals except as part of an international settlement under which our manufacturers would obtain compensating advantages elsewhere.Status of Private Property.60. The final suggestion as regards Colonies is that it might be made a rule of international law that private property held in Colonial territories should be secured from seizure or confiscation, even in the event of war. This proposal is understood to emanate from Germany, and this fact no doubt explains why the proposal is limited to Colonial territories, though there would appear to be no logical reason why it should not have wider application. As the United Kingdom has more foreign assets than any other country, a general undertaking in this sense ought to be to our advantage; but, in fact, enemy properties would be sequestrated by every country on the outbreak of war and their final disposal would be settled by the terms of peace. It seems very doubtful whether any undertaking given in advance would be capable of being carried out and it seems still more doubtful whether commercial interests would be influenced by such undertakings in their investment, policy. In any case, we cannot see any reason why His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept the proposal if limited to property in Colonial territories.Conclusions.61. While, for the reasons mentioned above, the suggestions relating to Colonial territories which are recorded in this particular section of M. van Zeeland&apos;s Report are, in general, unlikely to commend themselves to His Majesty&apos;s
YII.-PACT OF ECONOMIC COLLABORATION.62. Having reviewed the technical, economic and financial impediments to world trade, M. van Zeeland, in the Third Part of his Report, puts forward his suggestions as to the procedure to be adopted for their solution. He emphasises that wherever he went he found that the difficulties were closely interlocked, and that the solution of any one question depended on the solution of a series of others. The difficulties and their solutions lay not only in the economic and financial field : they were connected with and often dominated by the wider political problems under the shadow of which he recognised that he was working.63. In these circumstances, M. van Zeeland considers that any settlement must be a general one. But experience has shown that a general conference such as the World Conference of 1933 would not be likely to produce results without a great deal of preparation and, in particular, without previous agreement in principle between the Great Powers. M. van- Zeeland is himself convinced that none of the great economic Powers can afford to disregard international trade, and he believes that if the right way can be found, they will be able to come together and examine practical methods of economic collaboration, whatever their political systems. But the steps by which this result could be attained would have to be taken very cautiously. In the first place, he recom-mends a &apos;&apos; Pact of Economic Collaboration &apos;&apos; between the five principal economic Powers, viz., France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The discussion would be based on certain very elementary principles which it would be difficult for any country to contest, and these principles once established would be filled in and given practical application in connexion with the specific economic and financial problems discussed in the earlier parts of his Report.64. In his handling of the question, M. van Zeeland recognises that the fundamental problem in the way of international collaboration consists in the choice between autarky and international trade. Or, as M. van Zeeland. himself puts it at the outset of his Report: &quot;Are the methods which, taken as a whole, form the system of inter-national trade, fundamentally preferable to those autarkic tendencies which in varying degrees have inspired either new theories or a series of practical measures taken in numerous places ? &apos;&apos;65.   Elsewhere he formulates his problem as follows : &apos;&apos; In order to diminish the obstacles to international trade and to restore to it a degree of flexibility which will allow of its development, it is necessary in particular to induce many countries to mitigate or to abandon the measures of protective self-sufficiency which they have adopted in different degrees and in different times, and to return to a more complete system based on the international division of labour.&quot;66. At the present time, there are autarkic tendencies in the commercial policy of most countries. But the crux of the problem is to be found in the attitude of Germany and Italy, especially the former, towards any united effort to modify this autarkic tendency in the interests of international trade; and the question is whether either Germany or Italy are prepared to modify their existing policies in the direction of international collaboration.67. The consideration of this question raises issues of foreign policy, and their appreciation in the following paragraphs is naturally based on the viewsGovernment, we see no reason why the Government should not agree to discuss them with other Governments, if only for the purpose of clarifying the points at issue. An exception regarding our willingness to participate in any such discussion might, however, need to be made in respect of the first suggestion (that the administration of mandated territories should be made international), which in our view, has little, if any, bearing on economic problems.
of the Foreign Office. Certain members of the Committee feel some hesitation in expressing any views on the details, but we all concur in the conclusions reached in paragraph 85.68. Germany V policy need not be regarded as absolutely opposed to inter-national trade and to the well-being of her people. Every Government aims at improving the national standard of life, and even Herr Hitler, despite the importance which he attaches to national security and military power, constantly reiterates his concern for the material welfare of his people. Every Government, moreover, fears above all else the social and political consequences of extensive unemployment. In the year before Herr Hitler became Chancellor, the drastic policy of deflation adopted to meet the withdrawal of foreign capital produced 6,000,000 unemployed in Germany. This was one of the factors which raised him to power and determined his policy. His policy was to make work for the unemployed and to do so with the minimum recourse to foreign imports. This he achieved through his rearmament programme, which has helped very materially to reduce unemployment to under 1,000,000. The completion of the rearmament programme, though the day may be distant when Germany has all the armaments, fortifications, military roads and other equipment that, she thinks she needs, will presumably mean the diversion of labour into more peaceful occupations, and this readjustment will revive the problem of unemployment unless alternative occupation can be found either by internal works (productive or unproductive) or by extension of foreign trade.69. On the other hand, while Germany is by no means indifferent to her foreign trade, she strictly subordinates it to the needs of her policy in other directions. Economic self-sufficiency is unfortunately held in Nazi Germany to be an essential part of political and military strength, and the Four-Year Plan is as much a military as an economic experiment.70. In fact, Germany&apos;s policy accepts autarky as a necessity with inter-national trade as an auxiliary factor, whereas the van Zeeland approach is in the inverse sense. M. van Zeeland aims at a removal of exchange controls, whereas in Germany these controls appear to be an essential factor in the Nazi Party&apos;s hold over the country&apos;s economy. Further, it appears as though it were Germany&apos;s policy to use these controls as they exist in other countries (e.g., in Central and South-Eastern Europe) in order to weld their economies on to that of Germany in lasting dependence. The annexation of Austria will almost certainly add impetus to this development, and the resistance of Czechoslovakia is likely to be undermined by economic encirclement if it is not overwhelmed by military aggression. The result of this process will be to consolidate the economic control of Germany over all the Danubian and Balkan States and perhaps (very reluctantly) Turkey; with Italy and Poland attached thereto by bonds of economic necessity which are likely to affect their political attitude.71. Thus M. van Zeeland&apos;s proposals appear to run counter to the whole scheme of present German policy. It is true that there are certain more enlightened circles in Germany, e.g., that of Dr. Schacht, which would welcome a return to economic co-operation with the West. But since Dr. Schacht&apos;s exclusion from the Ministry of Economics he appears to exercise little influence on the German Governments economic policy. The statements of Herr Hitler&apos;s speech of the 20th February, 1938, appear to give clear indication that, though he himself may be unwilling to kill M. van Zeeland&apos;s proposals (he might indeed be glad to use an international conference as a platform on which to press Germany&apos;s claims, e.g., to Colonies), he is not prepared to join in any discussions on the only possible basis, viz., that of mutual concessions. Recent developments all tend to confirm that the rulers of Germany to-day attach little importance to international economic and financial co-operation; and while they would be ready to grasp any advantages that might be offered to them, they are not prepared to offer any substantial counterpart themselves.72. If we are convinced that Germany will not seriously discuss economic appeasement on M. van -Zeeland&apos;s basis, would it be better to abandon this approach altogether ?  In the mood of hopelessness which has affected some peace-
loving countries since the pounce upon Austria, it might seem that this was the only course to take. But there are certain arguments on the other side which merit consideration : (a) In Germany itself M. van Zeeland&apos;s Report was given a&apos;relatively good reception. This may reflect the genuine desire of the more liberal elements in German banking and commercial circles, who have always been, and probably still are, critical of the official policy and are anxious to find means for limiting its application; on the other hand, it may be due merely to official instructions to keep the British in play and to utilise the opportunity to press the colonial claims.(6) Germany&apos;s economic difficulties are likely to increase, notwithstanding the annexation of Austria and the possible economic control by Germany over the Danubian States; and the blame for these difficulties will increasingly be put upon the United Kingdom by the Nazi propagandists. If the van Zeeland initiative is abandoned, this will be quoted against us as a proof of insincerity.(c) Export markets are in fact essential to Germany; this is still admitted by the more responsible people in Germany. It will be increasingly evident, as the rearmament programme begins to slacken its intensity.(d) Although the Five-Power discussions proposed by M. van Zeeland are unlikely to progress far upon the lines of economic co-operation which he himself suggests, they might give rise to other suggestions, different yet none the less useful. Dr. Schacht at one time believed that if economic discussions were once begun, these would afford the most favourable introduction to discussions in the political field, (i?) Discussions of any kind between the principal Powers might give us a breathing space and afford time for the strengthening of our armaments, even if they led to no substantial results.73. In the case of Italy, the economic aspect of policy appears to be at least as subordinate to politics as in Germany; and the reception given by the Italian Press to M. van Zeeland&apos;s Report was contemptuous or negative. Such slight chance as exists of Italian co-operation depends almost entirely on the progress of the improved relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government. Italian industry is relatively more dependent than German industry on imported raw materials, and the possibilities of autarky are less promising in the Italian case. On the other hand, Germany has become Italy&apos;s most important market, and can supply her with a good deal of her coal and other requirements. There is, therefore, an alternative policy for the Italian Government to choose, viz., increasing dependence on a Central European economy dominated by Germany. There can be, however, little doubt that the influence of the industrialists of Northern Italy would be in favour of a return to the freedom of the Western economy; and there is some reason to think that the : Italian authorities, while on the surface more critical of the van Zeeland Report than the Germans, are in reality more anxious than the Germans for some economic rapprochement. They certainly appear to realise the difficulties of their situation better than the German authorities do, and they have stronger justification for claiming that their present economic and financial system is forced upon them by these difficulties.74. The practicability of Italian co-operation would appear, in fact, to depend upon the development of a political detente with France and the United Kingdom, and prospects in this direction should have been improved by the signature of the Anglo-Italian Agreement.75. Therefore, as regards the Five-Power discussions which are to be the first step in M. van Zeeland&apos;s programme, if Italy is prepared to co-operate and Germany is not (an unlikely hypothesis, since this would indicate a weakening of the axis), the discussions would be of advantage to us since this would be an indication of a return of Italy to the Western economy.76. If Germany is prepared to co-operate and Italy is not (an even more unlikely hypothesis), then it would be advantageous to us that the discussions should take place, since economically, at any rate, Germany is of much greater importance than Italy.
77. If neither Germany nor Italy will co-operate, then the main point of M. van Zeeland&apos;s initiative will be lost. It will not be to the advantage of His Majesty&apos;s Government that a Three-Power meeting should take place merely to emphasise its disagreement with the economic policies of the Dictator countries.78. Finally, if both Germany and Italy are prepared to co-operate (whether honestly or not), we can scarcely refuse; but we can choose our own time for starting the discussion.79. In order to explore the ground, the most practicable procedure would be to invite M. van Zeeland (as had been agreed between the United Kingdom, United States and French Governments) to prepare the way for Five-Power discussions by further personal enquiries in Washington, Berlin and Rome. It has since been decided that this invitation had better be suspended, at any rate until the German Government have shown in a practical form their willingness to undertake the financial responsibilities of the former Austrian Government towards the creditors of Austria. It is understood that M. van Zeeland himself i has expressed the view that action on his Report should be deferred.  The Frenchand United States Governments have been informed of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s view and they have both concurred in this postponement. The French Government in their reply have stated that they remain faithful none the less to the principles which inspired M. van Zeeland&apos;s Report. They hope that improved conditions may soon permit the useful resumption of discussions with a view to the conclusion of a Pact of International Economic Collaboration. We share that hope. If there are no further major political disturbances, and if the proposed financial and economic negotiations with Germany are satisfactorily concluded, the question of an invitation to M. van Zeeland should be considered afresh.80. It will be noticed that whereas in the above paragraphs we have dealt mainly with the difficulties in securing the co-operation of Germany and Italy, M. van Zeeland was also to be invited to explore the reactions of the United States of America to his Report; and we would like to emphasise the importance which we attach to this part of his proposed mission. The initial reception given to M. van Zeelands&apos;s recommendations, both by the public and by the administra-tion in the United States of America, was not very encouraging; yet the active and sympathetic co-operation of the United States of America will be of cardinal importance in any negotiations that may eventually be undertaken. In particular, no large-scale action on the financial recommendations in the Report can be envisaged by this country unless the United States of America are willing to accept at least a proportionate share of the financial responsibilities involved.81. It will also be necessary for us to keep in close touch with the French Government. The policy of France -affected as it has been by constant financial difficulties-has contributed not a little to the general economic troubles of Europe. It must be hoped that a restoration of a measure of confidence sufficient to enable France to co-operate more fully in the settlement of these troubles will not be too long delayed.82. If, therefore, political developments permit the invitation to be extended to M. van Zeeland to be taken up again, he will have to collect the reactions to his proposals of Germany and Italy, on the one side, and of the United States of America and France, on the other.83. The suggestion was made at a meeting of the International Chamber of Commerce that, after his review of the situation, it might be advisable to convene a meeting between the United States of America, France and ourselves, before attempting any Five-Power meeting. The argument is . advanced that the &quot; Have-Not&quot; Powers cannot alter their existing policies unless they know what the &quot;Haves&quot; are prepared to offer them in the form of concessions or assistance in meeting their financial and economic difficulties. On the other hand, the &quot; Have &quot; Powers could hardly be expected to formulate concessions without knowing what the &quot; Have-Not &quot; Powers are prepared to offer in the way of guarantees for peace. Moreover, the Germans and Italians have, in the past, not looked favourably on negotiations in which they have not been invited to participate from the outset.  It would appear, therefore, that while
consultations between the democratic Powers may well be necessary they should be conducted with as little publicity as possible, either through M. van Zeeland himself or through diplomatic channels.84. Until the Five-Power meeting has taken place and has resulted in some basis of agreement, it would appear premature to discuss the proposal put forward by M. van Zeeland for the creation of a Special Bureau to follow up its work and draft specific technical agreements. Any such bureau could best be left to develop naturally out of the secretariat of any Five-Power meeting that may take place.85.   Our conclusions on this part of the Report therefore are : (a) that the time is not at present opportune for setting on foot preparations for a Five-Power meeting;(b) that if no further major political disturbances occur and if the present financial and economic negotiations with Germany lead to a satis-factory agreement, His Majesty&apos;s Government should consider afresh, with the French Government, whether it is advisable to invite M. van Zeeland to pursue his enquiries as to the attitude of Germany, Italy and the United States of America to his Report;(c) that in that event, on receipt of M. van Zeeland&apos;s further observations,His Majesty&apos;s Government should decide (after consultation with the French and United States Governments) whether the time is opportune for convening a Five-Power meeting. Any such consultation should be conducted with as little publicity as possible either through M. van Zeeland himself or through diplomatic channels.86. If the Five-Power discussions should eventually take place and the attitude of the British representative comes to be defined, the following basic considerations must be borne in mind in order to appreciate the essential difficulty of his task.87. The present economic troubles of Europe are, in large measure, the consequence of wide changes in the world economic structure. For example, the development of manufacturing industries in many countries producing raw materials has destroyed the monopoly which European manufacturers formerly enjoyed in these countries; and most of the efforts made by European manu-facturing countries to counteract this change have been successful only in reserving to one or other of them a predominant share in a diminishing trade. The United Kingdom has suffered at least as much as other European countries from this development (cf. Lancashire), and we have been forced to strengthen the ties with the Empire countries and to limit the facilities which we could offer to imports from foreign countries. Countries like Germany and Italy have, in consequence, been forced to restrict their purchases from the Empire. The effect of these restrictions, in time, reacts on us, through the diversion of trade from Empire producers.88. There is no obvious remedy for the trouble, but it is a general trouble, affecting, in different ways, almost every country in the world. Each country, unfortunately, concentrates on its own difficulties and adopts such measures as seem likely to alleviate them, without regard to the ultimate consequences; while it too often treats the measures taken by other countries to meet their own difficulties as inspired by deliberate ill-will.89. The United Kingdom, partly as the result of its inherent strength and partly as the result of its policy, has succeeded better than any other country in maintaining the prosperity of its people without recourse to artificial stimulants : and at any conference we shall certainly be pressed to modify our policies where they have caused or increased economic troubles elsewhere. But we cannot go back on the system of tariffs or on the general principle of Imperial preference, nor can we leave our agricultural producers completely at the mercy of competition from abroad. We are therefore not in a position to take either the industrial or the agricultural products of Europe to the same extent as we did before 1931. Thus our policy which has reduced our imports from Eui&apos;ope in value, at any rate, by something like one-half since 1930 has facilitated Germany&apos;s task in developing her special and now, in fact, preferential
relations with the countries of Central and South-East Europe. We cannot afford to revise our own policy drastically, but any modifications which would tend to increase our trade with the Continent would probably, from our point of view, have a beneficial effect politically, as well as in the trade field.YIII.-SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.Introductory.90. In our examination of M. van Zeeland&apos;s Report and of the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Trade Policy, we have attempted in particular to see which of the proposals in those two Reports could be recommended for acceptance without any substantial counter-concessions being required from other countries. We recognise, however, that in an atmosphere of political appeasement and in return for adequate concessions by other Govern-ments it might be necessary to consider more radical action by the United Kingdom (paragraph 6).Economic Sphere.Tariffs.91. We have examined M. van Zeeland&apos;s recommendations concerning tariffs on industrial and on agricultural goods. We feel that our tariff on industrial goods has reached a general level of an appropriate character and that there would be probably little danger in giving an undertaking not to increase it, save in order to meet exceptional conditions. As regards the reduction of exceptionally high duties we feel that the Import Duties Advisory Committee might be asked to review the specially high duties to ensure that conditions have not changed (paragraph 14).92. As to agricultural products and undertaking not to increase our tariffs on them, we feel it should not be difficult for His Majesty*s Government to subscribe to some agreement fixing the maximum duties on staple agricultural products at a lower level than those in force in most foreign countries (paragraph 15).93&apos;. We feel that the gradual reduction of specially high duties and/or of the general ad valorem duty on agricultural products would be considerably more difficult unless (a) it was offset by the adoption of some other equivalent form of protection, or (b) it was carried out in return for concessions by other countries. Such equivalent protection would presumably take the form of either quotas or subsidies, or both, and the imposition of additional quotas might not be welcome while the extension of the system of protective subsidies might turn out to be equally objectionable (paragraph 16).Possibility of unilateral measures by His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Government.94. We have considered the possibility of the Import Duties Advisory Committee being invited to restrict their recommendations for increased duties to very exceptional cases. We understand, however, that the Committee appreciate the danger of any all-round increase in duties and that they prefer that no formal instruction in the sense suggested above should be addressed to them (paragraph 20).95. We have also considered the question of the efficiency of industries in relation to the tariff protection afforded to them and, again, the question of more adequate representation of consuming interests where tariffs are concerned. We feel that in these respects the- machinery of the Import Duties Advisory Committee is defective. We see no immediate remedy, however, and we feel that the Committee must be relied upon to safeguard the position so far as they can do so (paragraph 23).
Multilateral and Bilateral Trade Negotiations.96. Experience suggests that the time spent in trying to negotiate duty reductions with many countries at once (with the practical certainty that nothing substantial will be achieved) might be more effectively utilised in bilateral negotiations. At the same time, we feel that, if other countries are prepared to co-operate, His Majesty&apos;s Government would have no ground for refusing to participate in multilateral negotiations, more particularly as any wide relaxation of economic barriers (especially quotas) appears to be dependent, on multilateral action (paragraph 25). We assume that in the meantime His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment will continue their policy of concluding bilateral trade agreements as and when possible (paragraph 27).Group A agreements.97. On the question of group agreements and regional pacts in relation to the most-favoured-nation principle, we have set out the reasons which make it difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to encourage them (paragraph 29).^Quotas.98. So far as the suppression of industrial quotas is concerned, there is no difficulty for this country, since we have no such quotas (paragraph 32).99. As to our agricultural quotas, we see two alternatives : either (a) to maintain them and justify them as His Majesty&apos;s Government have done before, on the ground that they are based on principles quite different from those which govern the industrial quotas which we condemn;, or (b) to explain that our agricultural policy aims at safeguarding or stabilising agriculture by means of regulatory quotas (with only a moderate protective and preferential aspect) and to undertake to review them in order to see whether they accord with this principle (paragraph 37).100. We recognise, however, that, if the United Kingdom system of agricul-tural quotas is in the main to be retained, it will be more difficult to persuade European countries to abandon their industrial and agricultural quotas -(paragraph 38).Export Duties and Restrictions.101. There should be no difficulty about giving an undertaking not to introduce such restrictions in the United Kingdom, subject to a reservation in respect of national emergency (paragraph 40).Indirect Protection.102. We understand that it is the considered policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government not to refer to international arbitration complaints relating to sanitary restrictions. This attitude is unfortunately always liable to be regarded by other countries as evidence that our restrictions are not capable of justification. We assume, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not be willing to modify their policy (paragraph 43).Geneva tariff nomenclature.103. We feel that there would be considerable difficulties in fitting our tariff into the Geneva nomenclature, and we are advised that elaborate legislation would be necessary (paragraph 44).Financial Sphere.Currency.104. We recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not lose sight of the possibility of amending the Tripartite Agreement in the direction of giving it a greater appearance of stability. This would involve discussions with the United States and France, but we do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by general monetary discussions with Germany and Italy at present (paragraph 48).
Foreign Lending.105. We see no reason to recommend going farther than the statement made in the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 1st February, 1938 (paragraph 49).External Debts and Clearing Arrears.106. M. van Zeeland&apos;s proposal regarding the agreed adjustment of external debts is primarily a matter for settlement between debtor and creditor. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the Council of Foreign Bondholders frequently negotiates such settlements, and the policy recommended by M. van Zeeland may be said to be already in operation in this country. His further recommendation regarding the settlement of clearing arrears is open to considerable technical objection, but the United Kingdom is not directly concerned (paragraph 50).Reciprocal Credits.107. The United Kingdom again is not much concerned with M. van Zeeland&apos;s proposal regarding the opening of reciprocal credits through the Bank for International Settlements to assist those countries which are willing to contemplate the abolition of exchange restrictions. We doubt if the proposal would be of more than limited usefulness, but the first step appears to be that the views of the Bank for International Settlements should be obtained, and this, we understand, is being done (paragraph 51).Establishment of a Common Fund.108. We consider that the proposal regarding the establishment of a Common Fund at the Bank for International Settlements should be further examined by the Treasury in consultation with the Bank of England, but that at the present stage there is no reason for His Majesty&apos;s Government to do more than promise consideration of any practical scheme that may emerge (paragraph 52).References to the Colonies.109. In paragraphs 53 to 61 of our Report we examine certain suggestions made to M. van Zeeland and noted in his Report. Our general conclusion (paragraph 61) is that with the exception of the suggestion that the adminis-tration of mandated territories should be made international which in our view has little, if any, bearing on economic problems we see no reason why His &quot; Majesty&apos;s Government should not agree to discuss the various suggestions with other Governments. The most important suggestion from the point of view of the United Kingdom is that which envisages that the system of the &apos;&apos; Colonial Open Door&quot; should be greatly enlarged. The decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government taken in 1937 after consideration of the recommendations of the Interdepartmental Committee on Trade Policy was that they would be willing to consider specific requests for reductions of preference granted to the United Kingdom in the British Colonial Empire, and we assume (paragraph 56) that if and when this particular suggestion has to be discussed the attitude of this country will be based on that decision.Pact of Economic Collaboration.llo. In paragraphs 62 to 85 of our Report we examine the chances of success of M. van Zeeland&apos;s proposals regarding a pact of economic collaboration. The consideration of this question raises issues of foreign policy and the relevant paragraphs in our Report are based upon the views of the Foreign Office. Certain members of the Committee felt some hesitation in expressing any views on the details, but all members concur in the conclusions reached in paragraph 85.111. In paragraph 63 of our Report we note that experience has shown that a general conference such as the World Conference of 1933 would not be likely to produce results without a great deal of preparation and without previous agreement in principle between the Great Powers.
112. Our general conclusions on this section of the Report as summarized in paragraph 85 are (a) that the time is not at present opportune for setting on foot preparations for a Five-Power meeting,(b) that if no further major political disturbances occur and if the present financial and economic negotiations with Germany lead to a satis-factory agreement, His Majesty&apos;s Government should consider afresh with the French Government whether it is advisable to invite M. van Zeeland to pursue his enquiries as to the attitude of Germany, Italy and the United States of America to his Report,(c) that in that event, on receipt of M. van Zeeland&apos;s further observations,His Majesty&apos;s Government should decide (after consultation with the French and the United States Governments) whether the time is opportune for convening a Five-Power meeting. Any such consulta-tion should be conducted with as little publicity as possible either through M. van Zeeland himself or through diplomatic channels.113. In the concluding paragraphs (86 to 89) of our Report we describe certain basic considerations which must be borne in mind in order to appreciate the difficulties of a United Kingdom representative at any Five-Power discussions. We feel that, while the United Kingdom cannot afford to revise its own policy drastically, any modifications which would tend to increase our trade with the Continent would probably from our point of view have a beneficial effect politically as well as in the trade field (paragraph 89).Signed on behalf of the Committee,F. W. LEITH-ROSS(Chairman).25th June, 1938.
APPENDIX I.Import Duties Orders.ATTACHED are summaries of the additional Import Duties Orders and the Import Duties Exemptions Orders made between December 1935 and April 1938.   The Additional Duties Orders are classified under five heads :-I. Orders made to assist new industries;II. Orders directed against abnormally cheap imports; III. Orders making minor adjustments; IV. Orders reducing duties; and ;V. Miscellaneous.In some cases (as, for instance, that of locks) an Order has been made both to assist a new industry and to give protection against abnormally cheap imports; such Orders have been classified under what appears to be a predominant purpose in each case. The abnormally cheap imports forming the subject of Orders in Category II may result from low costs of production (e.g., in Japan) or from export subsidies (e.g., from Germany) or from deliberate sale below cost, but it has not been found practicable to separate these various causes; in some cases more than one cause may be present.Summary of Additional Import Duties Orders made between December 1935and the end of April 1938.I.

APPENDIX II.Notes by the Board of Trade.ifBilateral Agreements. :COMMERCIAL agreements affecting a w,ide range of products have been concluded by this country since the Ottawa Conference with the Scandinavian and Baltic countries (including Einland and Iceland), with Poland, the Argentine Republic and Peru. Negotiations for agreements of this kind are now proceeding with the U.S.A. and with Switzerland. Commercial agreements involving tariff concessions of a more limited scope have also been concluded with Germany, France and Turkey, and a treaty will shortly be signed with French Morocco. Practically all the tariff concessions reciprocally accorded under these agreements have been extended to third countries under the most-favoured-nation clause.   Prominent among the products which have benefited by the agreements are coal, iron and steel, cotton and wool textiles, machinery and motor products; but the list could be extended almost indefinitely. To take two examples, the Schedules of tariff concessions annexed to the Argentine and Polish Agreements extend in each case to more than twenty closely-printed pages, the items ranging in the former case from tin-plates to table-knives, and in the latter from tractors to tennis-rackets. The imports from foreign countries to which concessions have been granted include agricultural and fishery products, zinc, timber and timber manufactures, wood pulp, paper and board, silk yarns and manufactures, industrial chemicals, toys and many other goods.United Kingdom exports have also, of course, derived benefits, under the most-favoured-nation clause, from bilateral agreements which foreign countries have concluded among themselves.Regional Agreements.M. van Zeeland refers to criticisms of the most-favoured-nation clause and endorses the proposition that *&apos;&apos; The clause should remain, in principle, general and unconditional;&quot; Nevertheless, there should be provided an exception allowing its application to be suspended in the case of countries which employ inadmissible discrimination or which refuse to participate in a general effort aiming at the reduction of obstacles to international trade;&quot; Finally, it ought to be drawn up in such a way as not to obstruct the conclusion of group agreements or regional pacts so long as these do not tend to constitute a discriminatory regime, but to lower tariff barriers, and so long as they are open to the accession of all those who are willing to accept the combined obligations and advantages.&quot;$ The concessions accorded to United Kingdom goods by Peru have only been extended to the one or two third countries which have treaty rights in Peru to most-favoured-nation treatment.No. A rticle.9/37      Ferro-silicon containing not less than 20 per cent, of silicon. 10/37      Raffia, not further processed after stripping and drying. 11/37      Diatomaceous earth, not bagged or otherwise packed, containing notless than 35 per cent, of moisture.* 12/37      Ground sumach leaves. 13/37      Insoluble quebracho extract.!14/37      Bagasse, being sugar cane fibre, cleaned and dried, but not further processed.15/37      Works of art of certain classes or descriptions. 1/38      Certain alloys or mixtures of metal.* This Order changed the definition of an existing exemption, and thereby narrowed its scope.-j- This Order removed an existing exemption.
This criticism is not very clearly stated. The essence of any &quot; group agree-ment or regional pact &quot; running counter to strict most-favoured-nation principles is surely that it should &quot; tend to constitute a discriminatory regime.&quot; Perhaps M. van Zeeland means that if the group countries agree to lower tariff barriers inter se (as opposed to raising them against others), and to admit all other countries who wish to come in, the discriminatory aspect of the regime might properly be condoned. The objection to any such group from our own point of view (and equally, no doubt, from the point of view of other countries whose trade interests are spread fairly evenly over a wide field) is that its creation would confront us with a dilemma. If, on the one hand, we agreed to enter the group, we should presumably be obliged ex hypothesi to discriminate against non-members. This would be likely to provoke retaliation, and the ramifications of United Kingdom export trade are so wide that any advantages which we might reap from membership of the group would almost certainly be more than offset by the resultant dislocation of our trade with non-member countries. It is hard to see how such groups could spread widely and eventually link up with one another in the absence of some uniform formula for reducing trade barriers in their many forms (tariffs, quotas, &amp;c). The impracticability of any such formula is referred to in paragraph 24 of the Committee&apos;s Report. There would, moreover, be special objections to group membership from our own particular point of view, in that any such preferential regime would be liable to clash with imperial preferences inasmuch as it would involve a reduction of margins of preference. The other horn of the dilemma is that if we remain outside any group which may be constituted, we may lose trade with each of the group countries because of the-preferences which each will accord to the other members. This last argument may seem difficult to reconcile with our claim that our own Ottawa policy is not a purely selfish one, but has contributed indirectly to the recovery of world trade by stimulating the flow of trade within the British Empire. Clearly, however, much depends on the constituent members of the group and the nature of the trades which they carry on with one another. Hitherto our acquiescence in certain exceptions from the most-favoured-nation principle has been based generally on the existence of long-standing historical and economic associations (e.g., between the Baltic countries and between the countries which formerly were parts of the Ottoman Empire). We were prepared at the Stresa Conference in 1932 to entertain proposals for preferential regimes designed to benefit the Danubian States, and we acquiesced in fact in certain tariff preferences accorded to Austria by Poland and Italy.The Montevideo Resolutions and the Washington Agreement.On the initiative of the United States and following upon resolutions passed by the Seventh Pan-American Conference held at Montevideo in December 1933, an Agreement open to the adherence of all countries was opened for signature at the seat of the Pan-American Union, Washington, in July 1934. Copies were transmitted by the Union to all countries of the world. It was not considered that any reply from His Majesty&apos;s Government was called for. The Agreement has been signed by the United States of America, Belgium, Greece, Cuba, Panama, Guatemala, Colombia and Nicaragua; the U.S.A. and Cuba have since ratified.The Agreement provides that the Parties in their relations with one another will not invoke the obligations of the most-favoured-nation clause for the purpose of obtaining from Parties to multi-lateral conventions the benefits enjoyed by the Parties thereto. The conventions contemplated are those which are of general application, which include a trade area of substantial size, which have as their objective the liberalisation and promotion of international trade or other inter-national economic intercourse, and which are open to adoption by all countries.The matter was raised, also in July 1934, with Sir Frederick Leith-Ross by Mr. Thorp, the United States representative at the meeting of the Economic Committee of the League. Mr. Thorp stressed the favourable view which the United States Administration took of the idea and asked whether it was any use the United States of America elaborating definite proposals. It was not thought necessary to answer this enquiry. It was expected at the time that Mr. Say re, the Assistant Under-Secretary in charge of Economic Affairs at the American State Department, would be seeing the President of the Board of Trade but this meeting did not take place.
Recent pronouncements by spokesmen of the United States Government on the subject of international trade have been in favour of unqualified most-favoured-nation treatment as a general principle. Moreover, the policy which the United States Government have in fact pursued since the passing of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934 has been to lessen restrictions upon trade by means of bilateral agreements, the benefits of which are generalised by the operation of the most-favoured-nation clause. In accordance with the provisions of the Act they have extended to all countries other than those which are deemed to discriminate against American commerce (at present Germany) the benefits of the concessions which they have made under reciprocal trade agreements with individual countries. A notable exception is the agreement with Cuba, which provides for exclusive preferential advantages to both parties.At the Pan-American Conference held at Buenos Aires in December 1936, no attempt was made to secure wider adherence to the Agreement of 1934. The only reference to it was more or less incidental. The preamble to a Resolution dealing with Equality of Treatment in International Trade contained the phrase &quot; and ratifying the declaration of principles approved in the Inter-American Conference at Montevideo in 1933.&quot; It may be, therefore, that the United States Government have abandoned any idea of making the 1934 Agreement effective.APPENDIX III.Agricultural Quotas.Joint Memorandum by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Board of Trade.Since the date of the recommendations of the Interdepartmental Committee on Trade Policy His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided against the policy of a levy subsidy. Moreover, it does not appear very likely from the experience we had in attempting to negotiate a relaxation of the bacon quota on the basis of the substitution of a levy that an offer to substitute a tariff for the bacon quota would be likely to meet with approval amongst the main bacon-supplying countries.Moreover, His Majesty&apos;s Government could not undertake either that they will not impose new quotas or that they will not tighten up existing quotas without a complete and unjustifiable departure from their present announced policy on a large number of agricultural products. Such an undertaking might have serious consequences. We might be precluded from taking action to prevent a decline in agricultural production in the United Kingdom and this might have very undesirable repercussions in the light of the needs of national defence.The alternatives before Ministers appear to be the following :  (1) to explain and justify our agricultural quotas and not to offer any undertaking.This would be a perfectly possible and logical attitude and one for which other countries are already well prepared. We have always argued at Geneva and elsewhere that our agricultural quotas are quite different in intention and effect from the type of industrial quotas which are so serious a restriction on trade.If this line were to be taken it could be argued that the United Kingdom is the largest importer of foodstuffs in the world, and in the case of certain important agricultural commodities provides the only world market. If agriculture in the United Kingdom is to be maintained, as it must be for many reasons including the needs of national defence, some form of protection is required and quantitative regulation of the kind which we impose is preferable from the point of view of foreign suppliers, and, therefore, of international trade, to tariffs or subsidies at the rates that would otherwise be necessary to afford the requisite measure of assistance. This form of protection has made it possible to avoid imposing restrictive duties on inter-Imperial trade and on a substantial amount of our imports of foodstuffs from foreign countries and, while causing a reduction in the quantity of foodstuffs imported from foreign
countries, has increased the return for those imports. The substitution of tariffs for quotas, at a level at which they would be equally efficacious, could hardly be adopted as part of general negotiations for the reduction of trade barriers, while reliance on direct subsidies in replacement of quantitative regulation might impose a heavy continuous burden on the Exchequer. This latter alternative, in the absence of any restriction in the volume of imports whether by quotas or tariffs, might well lead to a marked expansion of supplies and decline in the price level which would increase the liability of the Exchequer for the assistance of home agriculture, and would probably give rise to evils greater than those for which quantitative control of imports is said to be responsible.In view of the recent rejection of the levy-subsidy system, and of the continu-ance of Dominion free entry, which the Government has just confirmed, the retention of the right to regulate imports is essential to the maintenance of United Kingdom agriculture. Even where assistance is given in the form of an Exchequer subsidy, quantitative regulation must be retained in order to avoid a collapse of prices of such an extent as would place an undue and uncertain liability on the Treasury.If the principle of quantitative regulation is admitted, it is not politically possible to single out one branch of agriculture as the appropriate subject of a gesture in the removal of quotas. Moreover, any such action might have the effect of upsetting that balance of our agriculture, which it has been the aim of the Government to restore.Broadly speaking it may be said that His Majesty&apos;s Government have not in general aimed at any marked expansion of United Kingdom agriculture beyond its existing modest basis, viz., the supply of about one-half of our food requirements. (The requirements of defence have not so far been regarded as calling for any fundamental departure from this principle.) Accordingly, the present policy&apos; of the United Kingdom Government looks rather to the safe-guarding or stabilising of agriculture by means of regulatory quotas, and to giving protection, in the sense of a differential advantage over imports, by means of subsidies (e.g., the new bacon and milk policies). We take the view that the regulatory type of quota is not strictly, or at any rate mainly, protective or restrictive of trade out prevents, in the interests of all producers, the violent fluctuations of quantity and price associated with the trade in agricultural products in a free market, and thus gives a much needed security to primary producers.(2) to explain that our quotas are in general regulatory (as under (1) ) with only a reasonable preference first for the home producer and second for the Dominions, and to say that new quotas would only be imposed in the light of these principles and that we would undertake a review of our existing quotas to see that they accorded with these principles.The general defence of our quotas would follow the same line as under (1) above. The undertaking in regard to new quotas would not cut across any policy so far announced, i.e., it would permit of the butter and cheese quotas for which provision is made in certain circumstances in the new milk policy, and probably of any quotas which would be likely to be considered desirable in the case of eggs and poultry. It would, moreover, allow of the introduction of a moderate measure of protection to branches of agriculture not at present assisted by quotas.The review of current quotas might involve some relaxation of the bacon quota, to which there need be no objection, as this is already proposed; in view, however, of the prospects of increasing supplies from British sources, both home and overseas, it is doubtful whether the relaxation will benefit foreign countries except in so far as it avoids some of the cuts which would otherwise have been imposed. Moreover, the relaxation is likely to cause a fall in bacon prices, which will not be welcome to foreign countries. The review might also prevent much tightening up of the fish quotas. A special reservation would have to be made for processed milks, since the present control of these products is instead of high protective duties recommended for the industry by the Import Duties Advisory Committee.An important factor in the consideration of this problem is the possibility of substituting for quotas determined by the United Kingdom Government international control of the market by producers themselves on the lines of the International Beef Conference. It would, however, be necessary to retain the right of the United Kingdom Government to introduce regulatory quotas, in
the event of the breakdown of any such conference machinery, as is provided in the case of beef under Part III of the Livestock Industry Act, 1937. There are possibilities in this direction in regard to mutton and lamb, milk products and fruit (especially apples and pears), and the British Empire Producers&apos; Conference at Sydney have recently, at the instance of the United Kingdom Delegation, passed resolutions advocating producer control of the market on an international basis. Any such system would be consistent with the general idea in the van Zeeland Report for the removal of trade barriers, for it is in the interests of everyone concerned that there should be orderly marketing of supplies in order to maintain the stability of the market.APPENDIX IV.Indirect Protection.Notes by the Board of Trade and the Ministry of agriculture. Methods of indirect protection.M. van Zeeland refers (a) to the restrictive interpretation of regulations or abusive administrative practices which result in the exclusion of certain foreign products, and he mentions in particular the abuse of sanitary regulations.He also refers to exaggeration of the detail of tariffs and the elaboration of specifications to such a point that the regulations, though in appearance of general application, are in fact aimed against an individual producer. On this it can fairly be claimed that the United Kingdom tariff avoids this excessive detail and is likely to do so. The influence of the United Kingdom Customs, in particular, is always directed against the elaboration of minute distinctions.M. van Zeeland refers further to (b) the abuse of anti-dumping measures, although he admits the right of a. country to defend itself energetically against dumping methods.Negotiation by bilateral agreement.M. van Zeeland cites as point (1) in this section of his Report the method of bilateral agreement as being the best fitted to produce rapid results, whether it is a question of simplifying and stabilising customs formalities, or of standardising the criteria applied in determining the origin or place of shipment of goods as well as the value which serves as a basis for the payment of ad valorem duties.This is unobjectionable as far as the Board of Trade is concerned, but the Customs might find difficulty in giving a binding undertaking to continue to apply-any particular rule or formula.M. van Zeeland suggests in this connexion that negotiators should base themselves upon existing international conventions dealing with these matters and upon.the very detailed studies carried out by the Economic Committee of the League and by the International Chamber of Commerce.Appeal to Arbitration.M. van Zeeland then turns to his point (2) and suggests greater recourse to what he describes as &quot;Joint Committees&quot; for the purpose of applying, in alleged cases of indirect protection, the stipulations of commercial treaties or of dealing with &quot;those unforeseeable cases such as often arise in business life.&quot; Failing success by this method, States should undertake, he suggests, to accept the award of an arbitral body and he cites in this connexion the &apos;&apos; Procedure for friendly settlement between States of differences of an economic character instituted by a resolution of the Council of the League in 1932, and the Arbitral Court of the International Chamber of Commerce.Under this &quot;Procedure&quot; a panel of 14 experts was appointed and a set of rules, which was not intended to become an international convention, was formu-lated.   The main features of the procedure are as follows : (a) no permanent body is set up;(b) States do not enter into any obligations;(c) the disputes must be of an economic nature;
(d) a dispute is only submitted to the experts at the common desire of theparties;(e) the parties themselves decide the terms of reference (advisory opinion,proposal for conciliation, arbitral award).It is not known whether any use has been made of this procedure.It is common practice in commercial treaties concluded by this country to make provision for the settlement of disputes by reference to the Permanent Court of International Justice unless some other method of procedure is agreed upon by the parties. Reference to the Permanent Court is admittedly not an elastic form of procedure such as M. van Zeeland has in mind.So far as the Board of Trade are concerned, however, very few disputes arise relating to action taken by the United Kingdom and those which do arise are generally settled through the diplomatic channel. If special machinery were set up to deal with them, they would probably be more numerous. Nor does there seem to be any particular virtue in the proposal so far as United Kingdom exports are concerned.The International Chamber of Commerce has operated systems of (a) conciliation and (&amp;) arbitration since 1921. These relate to the settlement of disputes between persons and companies (and not between States), and in the first ten years&apos; working nearly 500 international commercial disputes were sub-mitted for consideration. It is a common practice nowadays for contracts to embody a clause providing for arbitration by the International Chamber of Commerce.Geneva Tariff Nomenclature.M. van Zeeland says, finally, that as regards specifications, in the absence of special reasons, it would be highly desirable not to go beyond the limits laid down in the Geneva Nomenclature.As a general principle this may be satisfactory, but it would be inadvisable for this country to give a binding undertaking to abide by the Geneva no men-clature in making or modifying Import Duty Orders. We have to fit the tariff to the facts of the case as it exists at the time and it would be undesirable to be tied to a fixed verbal code.Sanitary Regulations.In regard to sanitary regulations there are no grounds for dissenting from the recommendations in M. van Zeeland&apos;s report to the effect that they should not be used for the purpose of economic protection. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Department primarily concerned, has used these regulations for the sole purpose of preventing the importation of disease, a policy which is facilitated by reason of the protection our insular position affords. If it is urged that our regulations are more severe than those of other countries, the answer is that there is no reason to suppose that other countries would not adopt exactly the same procedure if they had the same opportunity as we have to secure freedom from disease. Disease spreads rapidly and knows no boundaries. In these circumstances it is sometimes necessary to exclude imports from countries in a geographical area even though no disease has actually been reported at the time in some parts of this area. In carrying out this policy it is essential that the complete freedom of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in exercising control in regard to sanitary regulations should remain unfettered. The Ministry has, therefore, always taken the view that the United Kingdom should not adhere to any convention, of which several have been proposed in recent years, which would require its sanitary regulations to be submitted to the arbitration of an outside body in cases of dispute. The reasons which make arbitration in these matters unacceptable are the following : (a) Arbitration would never embarrass an exporting country, but would always embarrass an importing country. As this country is the largest importer of agricultural produce, we might continually be subjected to the challenge of an exporting country whose produce was excluded by our sanitary regulations;
(b) If the court of arbitration had powers of binding authority, the control of disease within our own borders, so far as imports of animals and plants are concerned, would pass to an outside body which would not be responsible either to the Minister or to Parliament. That position could not be accepted.Although opposed to any formal arbitration in regard to sanitary regulations, the Ministry has always been ready to agree to the experts of an exporting country conferring with its experts on any technical point of difficulty. In such discussions all the available evidence is frankly examined,APPENDIX V.Memorandum by the Treasury.*1. The &quot;Tripartite Agreement.&quot;- It is proposed that the so-called &apos;&apos; Tripartite Agreement&apos;&apos; should be extended to all countries collaborating in the policy set out in the Report and that those countries should agree to keep their currencies stable as between one another, within defined limits, for a period of a year, or at least six months, unless exceptional circumstances arose of a character of force majeure.Unless force majeure is to be interpreted so loosely as to make the change almost illusory, this would be a dangerous proposal. Most of the monetary troubles of recent years have resulted from attempts to keep a monetary unit fixed in terms of gold or of foreign exchange at a value out of trim with economic conditions. Values attained by the free play of the market, like the existing exchange between the dollar and the pound, command more confidence than values depending on legislative enactment or agreement. By this means the dollar-pound exchange has attained a ale facto stability, within reasonably narrow limits, and it cannot be maintained that the contingency of the exchange between the dollar and the pound varying materi ally is at the present time having any seriously detrimental effect on trade between the two countries.Moreover, it is almost certain, if a number of other currencies are to be included, that at some time changes in relative values will become necessary. And if they do it is always quite impracticable to give notice of them. If it is announced now that six months hence one shekel is to be equivalent to six pieces of eight instead of five, no one will sell a shekel for five pieces of eight; the exchange rate in the open market is changed immediately. M. van Zeeland, of course, does not suggest this; what he recommends is that the countries concerned should undertake to keep variations in their exchange within certain limits for a period of not less than six months, retaining discretion to modify the rate at the end of the period, if necessary. Such an undertaking would, no doubt, be of some advantage to trading operations during the earlier part of the period; but this advantage might well be counterbalanced by uncertainty as to whether the rates would be maintained, or altered, at the end of the period fixed.The Tripartite Agreement is not yet two years old. It was made in September 1936 at the moment when the French franc was being lowered from 76 to the   to 105 to the  , at which latter rate it was hoped that it could be held stable. This expectation has been disappointed, and by repeated changes the franc has now fallen to over 160 to the  . The British and United States Govern-ments have continued to regard the Agreement as in full operation as regards France, and it is probable that this attitude has, in fact, served a useful purpose, since the desire of successive French Governments to maintain this form of Co-operation with the United Kingdom and the United States has been an influence dissuading them from the adoption of exchange control notwithstanding much popular support in France for that policy.   Up to the present, moreover, it. * This Memorandum was originally written on the 1st March, 1938, and was subsequently revised, in certain respects, on the 27th April. Some of the references in the paragraphs on the &quot;Tripartite Agreement,&quot; more particularly to the franc, are again out of date, but it has not been thought necessary to delay the Report for a further revision of the Memorandum.
may fairly be said that the successive depreciations of the franc have represented a natural adjustment to real economic trends, and have not been the result of arbitrary decisions taken on theoretical or political grounds.Without going so far as M. van Zeeland, it may be agreed that, if anything could be done to remove something of the atmosphere of subject to twenty-four hours&apos; notice &quot; which attaches to the Tripartite Agreement, the result might be beneficial. This might not raise very much difficulty as between the Governments d  the United Kingdom and the United States, and will be worth exploring as soon as the depreciation of the franc has reached some limit. There is no reason to suppose that the French Government would be backward in subscribing to any formula even now; the point is that agreements, which promise reasonable stability of the exchanges and are in a very short time contradicted by events, are of little or no use.No advantage is to be gained from discussions on these matters with Germany and Italy. The position in Germany is that she would be well advised to lower the nominal exchange value of the mark somewhat to bring it into better relation with the pound and the dollar. This would enable her to get rid of export subsidies, avowed and disguised, and at least to reduce the number of separate categories of &quot; marks &quot; that now exist, each limited to certain purposes and subject to different degrees of depreciation. The advantages which a moderate devaluation would give to German export trade would probably be less inconvenient to the rest of the world than her present selective use of export bounties. But one can see no useful purpose in urging these considerations on her; Herr Hitler appears to have slammed the door in advance, and even if he were persuaded to listen it would only be on the basis that this was an English plan for which he would expect compensation elsewhere. It would, however, be absurd for us. to give him compensation for taking steps which are primarily in our view in the interests of Germany.2. Foreign Lending-It is, proposed that prohibitions and restrictions imposed in creditor markets on foreign lending should be relaxed.His Majesty&apos;s Government have recently announced an important change in this country&apos;s policy on foreign lending by which greater latitude will be given. British policy in the matter is as laid down in the Chancellors statement in the House of Commons on the 1st February.3. External Debts and Clearing A rrears. -It is proposed that, in order to pave the way for the abolition of exchange controls and Of clearings, (a) there should be an agreed adjustment of external debts Weighing on the debtor countries, and (b) that old frozen Clearing arrears should be consolidated by the issue of Government bonds of the debtor State, which could, if necessary, be mobilized with the help of &quot; international institutions.&quot;As regards (a), the adjustment of the external debts is primarily a matter for direct negotiation between debtor and creditor, viz., the representatives of the bondholders. As regards the external debt of other countries in British ownership, the recognised representatives of the bondholders are the Council of Foreign Bondholders. The Council have shown themselves ready to recognise the necessities of the situation, and have agreed to the reduction of interest rates in a large number of cases in which the debtor had been able to show that the original terms of the loan had, owing to changed circumstances, become unduly onerous. It may be said with truth that the policy recommended in this respect by M. van Zeeland&apos;s Report is already in operation so far as this country is concerned.As regards (b) consolidation of frozen Clearing arrears the United Kingdom is not very closely concerned. We have only three Clearings in opera-tion: of these, the Turkish Clearing has considerable arrears, but there is every hope of substantially reducing them as the result of bilateral negotiation with Turkey; the Italian frozen commercial debts have been paid off; and the Roumanian frozen trade arrears have been greatly reduced, and should be paid off in a year or two. There is thus no necessity for the adoption of this proposal as regards the Clearings to which this country is a party.His Majesty&apos;s Government are not directly concerned with the question whether $uch a scheme could profitably be adopted as regards Clearings to which this country is not a party, but it seems doubtful both whether there are many cases in which such a scheme would be really advantageous, and also whether, in
cases in which there is a large volume of frozen trade arrears in the Clearing, the credit of the debtor country would be sufficiently strong to enable the policy to be carried out.4. Reciprocal Credits. It is proposed that, as one means of providing those countries which have abolished their exchange controls and Clearings with credit facilities for financing their trade during the first period of adjustment, the Banks of Issue should open reciprocal credits in favour of one another through the Bank for International Settlements.There would be no objection on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to such an arrangement, should the countries concerned desire to adopt it, but it is thought that the scheme (which has been considered by the Financial Committee of the League of Nations and is now before the Bank for International Settlements) would, in fact, be of only limited usefulness.5. Common Fund. It is proposed that a Common Fund should be established by the States prepared to join in a programme of international co-operation, the Fund to be administered by the Bank for International Settlements, and its resources to be applied, under appropriate conditions, to facilitate the financing of legitimate trade operations during the period of readjustment, and to provide a temporary cushion to facilitate the return to monetary freedom after the necessary internal measures have been taken.On the merits of the case it may be doubted whether it is really wise for countries which are already burdened with excessive foreign debt to incur further external obligations, and there is clearly a danger that a cushion of this kind would, in fact, be used to maintain currencies at a higher level than is economically justifiable. In that event the disequilibrium would not be removed and exchange controls could not be successfully brought to an end.It is believed that, apart from the late M. Quesnay, this idea has always failed to elicit any support in influential circles at the Bank for International Settlements. Further consultation will be needed with the Bank of England before His Majesty&apos;s Government will be in a position to decide on their own attitude, and, of course, nothing more than a promise of consideration could be given until the attitude of the other countries, particularly the United States of America, which would contribute to the Fund if it were to come into being, is known.There are also some points on M. van Zeeland&apos;s recommendations, particularly the reference to forward exchange dealings, which will require elucidation.
