(0.) 270.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.MEDITERRANEAN, MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH-EAST AFRICA. (Previous C.I.D. Papers Nos. 1369-B and D.P. (P.) 18.)Report by the Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerningthe Middle East.THE Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East have had under consideration the following conclusions of the 315th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence : &apos;&apos; (iii) That the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee should investigate and report on the measures which might be taken, either before or on the outbreak of war, to influence those Minor Powers and Arab States whose assistance or even benevolent neutrality might be of value to us in time of war (paragraph 259).(xiii) That the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee should investigate and report on the possibilities of the overland route from Mombasa to Egypt as a reinforcement route to Egypt.&quot;Overland Route from Mombasa to Egypt.2. With reference to conclusion (xiii) above, the Sub-Committee have taken evidence from the Inspector-General of the King&apos;s African Rifles and West African Frontier Force, who has recently completed a journey over the route from Mombasa to Egypt. They have also invited the War Office, in consultation with the Air Ministry, to arrange for a memorandum in a form suitable for despatch to the British Ambassador at Cairo and to the Governments of Kenya and Uganda, asking that certain information regarding the route from Mombasa to Egypt should be checked and verified. On receipt of this information a report by the Sub-Committee will be submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence.Measures to Influence Minor Powers and Arab States.3. The measures to influence Minor Powers and Arab States whose assistance or even benevolent neutrality might be of value to us in time of war referred to in conclusion (iii) of the 315th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence fall under two heads : (a) Measures required in the event of war or imminent war;(b) Measures which might be taken before the outbreak of war.4. As regards the measures required in the event of war or imminent war, the Sub-Committee, as a preliminary to reporting to the Committee of Imperial*[17515]B
Defence, have invited the Foreign Office and other Government Departments concerned to obtain the views of His Majesty&apos;s representatives in the following countries : When these views have been received the matter will again be considered by the Sub-Committee and a report submitted.5. The present Report therefore deals with the measures to influence Minor Powers and Arab States which might be taken forthwith without waiting until war was imminent.   These may be summarised as : (i) Possible assistance to Ibn Saud in the reconstruction of the saudi arabian section of the Hedjaz railway, (ii) The proposal for the provision of an all-Arab Port on the Mediterranean coast.(iii) Frontier questions at issue with the Kings of Saudi Arabia and the yemen.(iv) The supply of arms to Ibn Saud and other Arab States.(i) Possible assistance to Ibn Saud in the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabiansection of the Hedjaz Railway.6. The Hedjaz Railway, which runs from Syria to Medina, suffered much damage in the Great War. The sections in what are now Syria, Palestine and Trans Jordan have to a great extent been restored, and the line is functioning as far south as Maan in Transjordan. But the section from Maan to the Saudi-Transjordan frontier at Mudawara needs extensive repairs, and the section from Mudawara to Medina, though partially restored after the War, has since become derelict, and remained so mainly because the Government of Ibn Saud have never been able to meet the cost of repairing it. The restoration of the section from Maan to Mudawara has as a consequence not been attempted. The cost of restoring the Saudi-Arabian section might be as much as  300,000 and the Transjordan section  100,000, hut these are only tentative estimates and need confirmation.7. The Railway was built some time before the War with capital raised partly by voluntary contribution from Moslems all the world over, and partly from taxation and other sources. The purpose of the railway was ostensibly purely religious, to enable pilgrims to travel easily and quickly to the Holy Cities; hut, in point of fact, it had also a military object, and was intended to strengthen Turkey&apos;s hold on Arabia. It has for many years been an aim of the Saudi Arabian Government to reopen this line to pilgrim traffic, Ibn Saud himself attaching great sentimental value to its restoration.Several efforts have in recent years been made by the Saudi Arabian Govern-ment to induce His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government to admit the principle that the Railway, the ownership and administration of which is now divided between Syria, Palestine, Transjordan and Saudi Arabia, should be treated as one indivisible whole, and that all the Governments concerned should contribute to the restoration of the derelict section in Saudi Arabia. Neither His Majesty&apos;s Government nor the French Government have been able to accept this contention.8. The Saudi Arabian Government have recently again requested His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government to examine a proposal that the whole line from Syria to Medina should be taken over, exploited and administered by some international company, e.g., the International Sleeping Car Company. The Saudi Arabian Government profess to see no difficulty in raising the necessary capital to achieve the restoration of the derelict section in Saudi Arabia, provided the functioning of the line as a whole by an international combine can be assured in advance.Saudi Arabia, Iraq,Egypt and Sudan, Transjordan,Iran,Turkey and Aden.
9. No reply has yet been returned to this communication from the Saudi Arabian Government; and the Sub-Committee have discussed the question whether some offer to assist in the restoration of the Saudi Arabian section of the railway might help to secure the continued goodwill of Ibn Saud. If so, such assistance would evidently constitute a measure to influence the Saudi Arabian Government, as contemplated in the present memorandum. It would also be in accordance with the policy of the Cabinet conclusion of the 22nd December, 1937, regarding the desirability in principle of exploring the possibility of financial assistance generally to Ibn Saud.The Foreign Office Representative on the Sub-Committee has suggested that the reconstruction of the Railway presents an exceptional opportunity of giving such assistance in a matter on which Ibn Saud has set his heart and which he thinks, rightly or wrongly, will benefit his country and the interests of Islam generally; and he has recommended that a start should be made by an offer from His Majesty&apos;s Government to contribute  30,000 (this being the sum which the Syrian Government and Ibn Saud himself seem prepared to contribute) towards the estimated cost (i.e., some  300,000) for the Saudi Arabian section, without prejudice to the necessity of increasing this offer later.10. The Foreign Office have also suggested that, if an offer is made, it should be accompanied by some stipulation that the contribution shall be properly used and* applied to the purposes for which it is intended, the remainder of the money being raised from elsewhere, and at the same time some constructive suggestion put forward (since it is unlikely that any international company could be formed in practice) to the effect that the Saudi Arabian Government might appoint the Palestine Railway Administration to be their managing agents for the carrying out, through agreed contractors, of the work of reconstruction and thereafter for the operation of the Saudi Arabian Section, at the expense of the Saudi Arabian Government, until such time as other arrangements could be made.11. As against this various objections are seen in other quarters. In the first place, it is suggested that an offer of  30,000, if made subject to conditions which might not be possible of fulfilment, particularly in regard to raising the much larger residue of the money required, would not gain any lasting gratitude from Ibn Saud and might merely render necessary much larger offers, ending even with His Majesty&apos;s Government being obliged to bear the greater part of the expense. In any case, the contribution of His Majesty&apos;s Government could not stop at  30,000, since the restoration of the Maan-Mudawara section (without which the restoration of the Hedjaz section would be useless) would need another contribution, tentatively estimated at  100,000. Moreover, as it is common ground that the restored line would be most unlikely to be a commercial success, they might be faced with recurrent annual deficits on running in respect of the Transjordan section. Finally, it is suggested that if Ibn Saud were to discover, as he inevitably would, that the restored Railway was a burden instead of an asset, his gratitude for any contribution His Majesty&apos;s Government might have made would turn to resentment at the action of His Majesty&apos;s Government in encouraging him in an unprofitable venture, which might mean that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to bear the deficit on running the Saudi Arabian section also.12. The Foreign Office admit to the full the force of these arguments. But the point to which they attach importance (on exclusively political grounds and because of the need in the present international situation of neglecting no opportunity of influencing Ibn Saud in favour of this country) is that a gesture should be made to Ibn Saud which would show him that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, while feeling it their duty to make it unmistakably plain to the Saudi Arabian Government that the reconstruction of the line was most unlikely ever to be a profitable concern, are nevertheless sympathetic in principle towards a project in which the Moslem world is keenly interested. Moreover they consider a further important point to be that the offer should be communicated to the Saudi Arabian Government at the earliest possible opportunity. The next year or so constitutes the dangerous period, when Ibn SaucTs friendship is essential. In the most favourable circumstances the Railway is unlikely to be working within that time, and difficulties thereafter in operating the line are likely to be less important.   The Railway may even never be operated at all, whatever 17515] b 2
offer His Majesty&apos;s Government may make. But from the political point of view the important thing is, not that the Railway should be operated successfully, but that the Saudi Government should be influenced in favour of this country by an offer to assist them in a project which they have at.heart. As regards the possibility that an offer of  30,000 might merely lead His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment into a position in which much larger offers might be necessary, the Foreign Office have never regarded  30,000 as a final figure. Nevertheless, if it were represented to Ibn Saud that in addition to this sum (which they would represent as a token payment or gesture of goodwill), His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to undertake at their own sole expense the reconstruction of the Maan-Mudawara section, they could probably insist without incurring resentment that  30,000 was the outside limit of the assistance which they would give in the form of money to the Saudi Arabian section.13. It may be added that the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan strongly supports, on political grounds, the suggestion of the Foreign Office and urges that if anything is done it should be done soon.14. In the circumstances the Sub-Committee can only put the reconstruction of the Railway forward as one way in which it has been suggested it would be possible to spend money with the object of obtaining an immediate, though possibly not a lasting, benefit in the form of gratitude from Ibn Saud..(ii) Proposal for the Provision of an All-Arab Port on the Mediterranean Coast.15. It is understood that for commercial, and even more for sentimental reasons, the desire for a port on the Mediterranean coast under exclusively Arab control is strongly felt among the Arab States in the Middle East. Control of Beirut and Alexandretta having been denied to them by the inclusion of these ports in the Lebanese Republic and the independent Sanjak respectively, the satisfaction of Arab aims must be sought, if at all, in Palestine. The. question of the future political status of Palestine is at present under consideration by the Palestine Partition &quot;Commission, and it cannot be assumed at the present stage that any particular scheme of partition of Palestine will be adopted; but it seems not unlikely that under any scheme of partition the port of Haifa would fall either under Jewish or British, but not under Arab, control. The outline scheme of the Palestine Royal Commission provided for the inclusion of Jaffa in the independent Arab State, with which, however, it would not be geographically connected. The only alternative port which could be included in Arab territory would be that at Gaza, which is at present in an entirely undeveloped state.The question is one which the Palestine Partition Commission can hardly fail to take into consideration when preparing their Report.(iii) Frontier questions at issue with the Kings of Saudi A rdbia and the Yemen.(a) South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia.16. It has recently become apparent that a settlement of the long-standing dispute over the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the Trucial Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf might be secured were it possible to concede to Ibn Saud territory which would give him access to the Persian Gulf at the Khor-el-Odeid. This cannot in any case be done without the agreement of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who owns the territory in question. In order to secure his agreement, it would presumably be necessary to offer him some form of compensation, possibly including a payment in cash.Objections have in some quarters been advanced on political and strategical grounds to allowing Ibn Saud- a footing on the Trucial Coast, and the question how far, if at all, it is politically desirable to make the concession, and for that purpose to try to persuade the Sheikh to part with some of his territory with or without the offer of money for doing so, is still the subject of inter-departmental discussion, and the Sub-Committee do not wish to make any recommendation upon this point. But a settlement of the South-Eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia is in itself an object which it would unquestionably be well worth while to attain at the expense of a reasonable financial outlay If that should be the only price to be paid both as a means of securing the goodwill of Ibn Saud in the present
international situation and on the longer view of peace and security in Eastern Arabia. Without prejudice, therefore, to the consideration of the question in its wider aspects, the Sub-Committee suggest that expenditure with the object of settling the South-Eastern frontier question is a possible way in which His Majesty&apos;s Government might usefully use their financial resources as suggested by the Committee of Imperial Defence.The amount necessary cannot be estimated with any degree of accuracy: But a figure of  25,000 might provisionally be authorised for this purpose.(b) The King of the Yemen and Shabwa.17. In June 1937 proposals were under consideration for the conclusion of an agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the tribes of the Shabwa area in the Aden Protectorate. In September, however, before any such agreement had been concluded, the King of the Yemen protested against the attitude of the Aden authorities in respect of these tribes, and represented that the Shabwa area formed part of the Yemen, alleging that administrative action by the Aden authorities in this area was a breach of Article III of the Treaty of Sanaa. His Majesty&apos;s Government have resisted this claim, but have adopted the attitude that, while they claim all territory up to the &quot; violet &quot; line (i.e., the line agreed with the Turks before the war), the King of the Yemen is not precluded by the Treaty of Sanaa from disputing their claim. They have suggested that, at some convenient date, there should be an informal and friendly discussion between representatives of the two Governments with a view to arriving at an agreed settlement of the boundary in this area. Meanwhile, negotiations with the Shabwa tribes have been deferred. The matter is a very live issue at the present time owing to the fact that the King of the Yemen has recently shown signs of intervening actively in the Shabwa area.18. The situation was discussed at a recent meeting of the Middle East Sub-Committee, and it was agreed that the Governor of Aden should be informed : (a) that negotiations with the Shabwa should not be proceeded with for thepresent.(b) that the Imam should be invited to enter upon a friendly discussion ofthe whole question of the Shabwa area.(c) that the previous decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government, that any attempt by the Imam to seize the territory by force should be resisted, must stand, and that the Imam should be informed beforehand of our intentions.(d) that the Governor of Aden should be informed that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment concur in his view that the Shabwa area is of small importance to us, either from the political or strategical point of view. (Some criticism of this view has, however, been expressed by Mr. Ingrams, Resident Adviser in the Hadhramaut.)19. It might be possible to placate the King of the Yemen by conceding forthwith his claim to the Shabwa area; but it was agreed at the meeting of the Middle East Sub-Committee referred to above that the best policy was for the Governor of Aden to endeavour to start negotiations with the Imam on a friendly basis. It was felt that if, as the outcome of such negotiations, it was finally decided to abandon our claim to the Shabwa area, the prestige of His Majesty&apos;s Government would not suffer to the same extent as if we abrogated our claim without negotiation. It may be said, therefore, that, so far as this question is concerned, the possibility of placating the King of the Yemen by some concession in this area is being kept fully in mind.(iv) The Supply of A rms to Ibn Saud and the A rab States.20.   This question can be considered under two heads : (a) The sale of arms to independent rulers who are anxious to purchase from His Majesty&apos;s Government.
(&amp;) The free provision of arms to those rulers who are dependent in greater or lesser degree upon His Majesty&apos;s Government for protection, and who are unable to afford to purchase the arms they require.Category (a) includes Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. Category (6) includes Koweit, the Trucial Sheikhs, Mascat, and the Sheikhs of the Aden Protectorate.(a) The Yemen and Saudi A arabia.21. In the past the Yemen and Saudi Arabia have made enquiries from His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the availability of war material and the terms oh which it could be supplied to them. In the case of the Yemen no orders were placed, presumably because we were unable to meet their requirements either as regards delivery or terms of purchase. It is believed that the Yemen is about to place large orders with the Italians, who have made offers at much reduced prices and on easy terms of repayment. In the case of Saudi Arabia we were able to supply machine guns and field guns last year up to the amount which Ibn Saud was able to pay in cash. He is now engaged in negotiations with various continental countries for further supplies.While it is understood that present conditions preclude the provision of even obsolete or obsolescent war material for these States, it is suggested that any future opportunity of meeting their requirements should as far as possible be met. To make the transactions attractive, it is important that the prices quoted should be as low and the terms of payment as easy as possible. In the case of Saudi Arabia especially, low prices and easy terms are the main consideration.(b) The Minor Arab Sheikhdoms.22. The importance of the States situated along the coast of Arabia from Koweit to Aden lies in the air routes which pass through them and the oil installa-tions (particularly in Bahrein) which they contain. These States are liable, even in peace, to attack by marauding Arab tribes from the interior, and the oil installations offer a tempting object for sabotage or for attack with loot as the primary incentive. In war or in time of general unrest in the Middle East, these dangers may be considerably increased, particularly if the larger Arabian States were unfriendly to Great Britain, or unable to restrain their less amenable tribes.23. It is suggested that we could consolidate our relations with these minor States and improve their ability to safeguard our interests, as well as their own, against local attack, internal or external, by offering them comparatively small amounts of small arms and ammunition. Such arms and ammunition might be issued to local levies raised and maintained in peace time, or might be stored for issue to levies which would be raised in time of emergency. It is suggested that this problem might be investigated by the local British Authorities in order to produce a detailed plan.Conclusions.24. Our conclusions on the question of the measures to influence Minor Powers and Arab States which might be taken before the outbreak of war may be summarised as follows : (i) The Saudi Arabian Section of the Hedjaz Railway.That, whilst the proposal is fraught with many difficulties, the recon-struction of the Saudi Arabian section of the Hedjaz Railway is worth consideration as one possible means by which an immediate, though possibly not lasting, benefit in the form of- gratitude from Ibn Saud might be obtained (paragraphs 6-14).(ii) Proposal for the provision of an All-Ardb&apos;Port.That the proposal for the provision of an all-Arab Port is one which cannot be carried further pending the report of the Palestine Partition Commission (paragraph 15).
2 Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1, July 13, 1938.(iii) Frontier questions at issue with the Kings of Saudi Arabia and the yemen.(a) That expenditure with the object of settling the question of the SouthEastern frontier of Saudi Arabia is a proposal worthy of consideration (paragraph 16).(b) That the Departments concerned  should continue to examine thepossibility of placating the King of the Yemen by some concession in the Shabwa area (paragraphs 17-19).(iv) The Supply of A rms to Ibn Saud and other A rab States.(a) That any future opportunity of meeting the arms requirements of theKings of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen should as far as possible be met. To make the transaction attractive, it is important that the prices quoted should be as low and the terms of payment as easy as possible.(b) That our relations with the Minor Arab Sheikhdoms might be con-solidated, and their ability to safeguard our interests as well as their own improved, by offering them comparatively small amounts of small arms and ammunition; and that this problem might be investigated by the local British authorities in order to produce a detailed plan (paragraphs 20-23).Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee :J.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   July 1938.SECRET. Copy No.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 329th Meeting, held on July 19, 1938.&quot;iT &quot;TV TP VY&quot; &quot;TV&quot;(7)-MEDITERRANEAN, MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH-EAST AFRICA.(OLD. Paper No. 1447-B.) (Previous reference : OLD. Minutes of the 315th Meeting, Minute 2.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a report by the Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions concerning the Middle East on the measures which might be taken to influence those minor Powers and Arab States whose assistance or even benevolent neutrality might be of value to us in time of war (C.I.D. Paper No. 1447-B).SIR JOHN SHUCKBURGH explained that the report before the Committee related to measures which might be taken forthwith without waiting until war was imminent.SIR THOMAS INSKIP suggested, and the COMMITTEE agreed, that the Sub-Committee&apos;s conclusions should be dealt with seriatim:(i) The Saudi Arabian Section of the Hedjaz Railway.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART said that the Foreign Office had received a despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Jedda* forwarding a note from the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs, which asked whether the British and French Governments were prepared to contribute towards the cost of repair to the Hedjaz railway in consideration of the fact that the damage had been done by the Allies during the Great War in their military interests, and also whether the British Government would agree to hold a conference of British, French, Saudi and Syrian representatives at Jedda with a view to an agreement as to the repair of the line. He added that Ibn Saud had been less friendly of late, and the Foreign Office considered that a contribution towards the cost of reconstructing the Hedjaz railway was a possible means of earning his gratitude at a time when it was most important to do so. They therefore hoped the proposal would be adopted. In reply to a question by Sir Thomas Inskip as to the source from which the remaining money for the construction of the railway was to come, he said that funds for this purpose had been voted by the Syrian Parliament.SIR JAMES BARLOW pointed out that Ibn Saud himself had no money and was not in a position to borrow.SIR JOHN SHUCKBURGH said that Ibn Saud&apos;s idea was that the whole of the Hedjaz railway should be placed in running order for use as a pilgrim route. The reconstruction of the Hedjaz section would be useless unless the Maan-Mudawara section through Trans-Jordan were also restored; this would necessitate further expenditure, tentatively estimated at  100,000. The liabilities of His Majesty&apos;s Government would therefore amount to at least  130,000. The railway had never been a paying proposition.* E 3794/1237/25, dated 27th June, 1938.[17611-1]
SIR SAMUEL HOARE was of opinion that, as Ibn Saud had hitherto been our only friend amongst the Arab States and in view of the difficult situation now existing in Palestine, some other action to retain Ibn Saud&apos;s friendship should be taken if it were decided not to make the offer of a contribution of  30,000 towards the reconstruction of the Hedjaz section of the railway. We had made the fatal mistake of discontinuing our subsidies to the Arabs after the Great War.   We should have to do something else for them.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART considered that no other means of assisting Ibn Saud was open to us. He added that, in Sir Reader Bullard&apos;s view, we should be lucky in a future war if Ibn Saud remained neutral.Mr. MALCOLM MacDONALD considered that it was important in view of the situation in Palestine to retain Ibn Saud&apos;s friendship. His full support might make an appreciable difference to the Palestinian situation.SIR THOMAS INSKIP&apos;S view was that, as the proposal for a meeting at Jedda had emanated from Ibn Saud, it should be agreed to, even though we might find that the result of the conference was a contribution by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment of  30,000. This action might take the edge off his resentment in regard to our Palestinian policy.SIR JAMES BARLOW said that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was of opinion that a contribution of the order of  30,000 would be futile and have no effect on Ibn Saud. Even if the project for the reconstruction of the railway matured, the railway would still be a white elephant; and it was more than doubtful whether it would be constructed without a further contribution from the British Government for maintenance. The control of the railway might be a constant source of friction between Ibn Saud and the British Government. There would, however, be no objection to a reference to the contribution of  30,000 being made at the proposed meeting at Jedda, when it could be said that we would be prepared to help in the reconstruction of the Hedjaz section of the railway, provided Ibn Saud were able to find the remainder of the cost elsewhere.SIR SAMUEL HOARE asked whether the contribution was dependent on Ibn Saud putting up a scheme for the reconstruction of the railway.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART said that that question had not yet been gone into.  The project, however, was not a commercial proposition.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD was of opinion that, in view of the situation in Palestine, the contribution should be made.SIR THOMAS INSKIP summarised the view of the Committee as being that Ibn Saud&apos;s proposal for a conference at Jedda should be agreed to, and that the British representatives should, be authorised to make an offer to Ibn Saud of  30,000 towards the reconstruction of the Hedjaz section of the Saudi Arabian railway, subject to Ibn Saud being able to make satisfactory financial arrange-ments for obtaining the remaining cost of the Saudi Arabian section. In this connection it was to be noted that the restoration of the Hedjaz section would be useless without the restoration of the Maan-Mudawara section through Trans-Jordan, and that this would involve His Majesty&apos;s Government in further expenditure tentatively estimated at not less than  100,000.(ii) Proposal for the Provision of an all-Arab Port on the Mediterranean Coast.SIR JOHN SHUCKBURGH explained that no action on this proposal was considered possible until the report of the Palestine Partition Commission had been received.(iii) Frontier questions at iss&apos;ue with the Kings of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen.(a) South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia.:: SIR JOHN SHUCKBURGH explained that, in order to rectify the South-Eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, the proposal had been made that certain territory belonging to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi should be ceded to Ibn Saud. To this end the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi might have to be compensated to the tune of
