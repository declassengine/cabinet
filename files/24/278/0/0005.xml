LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.NAVAL EXPENDITURE.Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.I. Introductory.1. THE Cabinet, at the meeting held on the 16th February, 1938, approved generally my further report on defence expenditure in future years (CP. 24 (38)) as providing for the due distribution and use of our available resources in accordance with the principles already approved by the Cabinet as set out in my earlier report (CP. 316 (37) ).2. In particular, the Cabinet agreed that the figure of  1^650 millions should be taken as the maximum sum which can be regarded as available for all defence purposes over the five years 1937-1941. After deducting the provision required for civil defence measures, the total of  1,570 millions was left for the three Defence Departments. I was asked, after consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the three Defence Ministers, to prepare as soon as possible a plan for the definite allocation of  1,570 millions between the three Defence Services. The Cabinet also agreed that it would be the duty of each Service Department to draw up programmes which could be carried into effective completion, within the sum allotted, by March 1942, such programmes to be complete in themselves.3. On the 11th March I wrote to each of the Defence Ministers to inform them of the sort of figures which, from a preliminary survey, I had in mind as allocations over the four years 1938-1941.4. The object of this paper is to deal with Naval expenditure, but it will, perhaps, be convenient to remind my colleagues of the position reached in regard to the other two Service Departments.5. War Office. On the 27th April, the Cabinet had before them a paper dealing with the War Office Programme (CP. 99 (38)). I set out in that paper the proposals made by the Secretary of State for War with a view to bringing the total Army expenditure within the compass I had suggested. I pointed out that the reductions proposed amounted in all to  70 millions as compared with the total reduction of  82 millions implied in my figures&quot;; and further, that the whole of the reduction offered would not accrue within the period 1937-1941. Nevertheless, I thought that the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals should be accepted. This conclusion was approved by the Cabinet.[17553] B
6. Air. In regard to the Air, the position is somewhat different. As a result of political developments in Europe, the Cabinet reached the conclusion that there must be acceleration and expansion beyond the scheme previously approved (Scheme F).  On the 27th April, Cabinet agreed : (a) to take note of the estimate of the aircraft industry that 12,000 aeroplanescould be produced within the next two years;(b) to authorise the Air Ministry to accept as many aeroplanes as they could obtain up to a maximum of 12,000 machines in the next two years;(c) to take note that these decisions would involve an expenditure during thenext two years that would exceed the figures contemplated for those years, but not the total of  1,650 millions provided for the Defence Services during the next five years, and that the Cabinet were not committed to that rate of expenditure beyond 1940.7. The position in regard to the Air Ministry is, I understand, that the Department are engaged in preparing estimates of the total expenditure in 1938 and 1939 necessary to give effect to this programme. Until this has been done the allocation of funds to the Air Ministry for the remaining years of the quinquennium is in suspense. The Air Ministry are thus proceeding with the plans indicated in the Cabinet decision of the 27th April as regards the period up to March 1940, but the policy thereafter remains to be determined.Summary of the Position in regard to the Navy ration.8. To return to the Navy; as stated above, on the 11th March, I wrote to-the First Lord, suggesting a provisional allocation for the three years 1939-1941. The figures which I suggested are as follows :  millions.1939       ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      1351940       ...................      1201941..................      1009. On the 29th March the First Lord replied to the effect that if Navy expenditure were to be restricted to anything like the figures which I had mentioned, it would not be a question of economy, or a sacrifice here and there, but of revising fundamentally the scope of our Naval Rearmament as hitherto contemplated. Fie said that on the basis of the D.R.C. Fleet,* the Admiralty would want about  30 millions more in all in these three years than the figures which I had sugggested, and that on the basis of the New Standard Fleet,*  80 millions more, over these three years.10. On the 13th April the Cabinet had before them a memorandum from the First Lord (CP. 92 (38)) headed &quot;Measures of Acceleration proposed in consequence of the international situation.&quot; In this paper the First Lord urged that financial provision amounting in all to  31 millions should be made, irrespective of the figure proposed for the Admiralty ration, for five measures of defence against air attack which he regarded as of the first importance from the Naval point of view. I should add that these are all &quot; new items,&apos;[ i.e., items not taken into account at all or only to a small extent in the forecasts of expendi-ture previously submitted by the Admiralty. Their cost, in so far as it falls in the next three years, is, however, fully allowed for in the latest estimates given by the First Lord.11. The Cabinet agreed to invite the First Lord to consider whether these proposals could be brought within the share provisionally allotted to the Admiralty out of the total sum of  1,570 millions, and in the meantime postponed a decision until this procedure had been carried out.12. About a fortnight later, on -the 28th April, the First Lord wrote to the Prime Minister proposing that the Cabinet should be asked to agree that the Defence Plans (Policy) ^Committee should be asked to examine again forthwith the role of the Navy, with a view to laying down a definite standard for the guidance of the Admiralty, having in mind that the decisions as to our future* An explanation of these terms is given in paragraphs 27 onwards.
Naval strength cannot be delayed beyond September next, when the planning of our 1939 requirements will begin. He asked that in the meantime approval should be given to the proposals contained in his memorandum CP. 92 (38).13. This led to a discussion between Ministers, as a result of which the Chancellor of the Exchequer wrote to the First Lord on the 9th May. In his letter he asked the First Lord to submit particulars showing reasons for the large increase in the forecast of Naval expenditure as compared with the forecast submitted in August, 1937. He also suggested that since the Admiralty contention was that the D.R.C. Fleet was not, in the circumstances, adequate, and in &quot;consequence they wished to urge some additions thereto, particulars should be submitted, showing in tabular form the make up of the D.R.C Fleet, together with a statement of the case for the substantial additions in each category of ship for the larger Fleet which the Admiralty regard as necessary. The Chancellor said that, in his view, the submission of these particulars would go a long way to clarify the position.14. The First Lord replied to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a full letter dated the 27th May, in which he gave detailed explanations on the lines proposed. In drafting this paper I have drawn freely on the information contained in this letter and in the letter referred to in paragraph 12.15. After the receipt of this letter a meeting was held between the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself, at which it was agreed that since this paper raised wide issues of policy, it was desirable that the matter should be submitted to the Cabinet forthwith.16. I have thought it right to set out the various steps which have been taken in regard to this matter; both in fairness to the First Lord, who has throughout been anxious for an early decision, and in order to remind my colleagues of the stages at which they have been called upon to give decisions affecting the Navy Programme. There can be no doubt that the absence of a decision as to the general policy which should govern our Naval preparations is highly embarrassing to the Admiralty, and that if a decision is much further delay^ed, it can only result in unbusinesslike and uneconomic administration.II. The Financial Issue.17. I do not propose in this paper to enter into detail. Rather, it is my object to summarise the broad issues involved, in regard to which a decision is required.18. Since this matter has arisen out of the proposed allocation of funds to the Navy, I will deal first with the financial issue in relation both to the next three years and to subsequent years.19. As regards the next three years, 1939, 1940 and 1941, my provisional allocation for the Navy was  355 millions. From the latest figures given by the First Lord, it appears that the Admiralty requirements in these three years exceed my provisional allocation by about  40 millions on the basis of the D.R.C Fleet, a basis which the First Lord rejects as wholly inadequate, and by about  88 millions on the basis of the New Standard Fleet.20. In regard to the Army, the settlement referred to in paragraph 5 involves an excess of not less than  12 millions over my provisional allocation.21. In regard to the Air, the late Secretary of State stated that he thought that the scheme of expansion on which the Air Ministry are now working would cost about the same as Scheme K, the cost of which was some  60 millions in excess of my provisional allocation.22. My colleagues will also be aware that certain proposals have recently been submitted, and are now under consideration, in regard to the Defence of India. These proposals, if accepted, would involve an additional charge on the Exchequer of some  30 millions capital expenditure over a period of, say, four years, and ultimately some  4-5 millions annually in current expenditure.&quot; [17553] b 2
23. It seems clear, therefore, that the figure of  1,570 millions is bound to be exceeded,, even if the Admiralty were able to keep Naval expenditure within my provisional allocation.24. But it is also necessary to have regard to the expenditure after the quinquennium ending in March 1942. The First Lord states that if the New Standard were to be approved now, it could not be reached by 1942. It follows, therefore, that expenditure after 1942 would continue to be substantially above the figure estimated to be necessary for the normal maintenance cost of the New Standard Fleet. For example, the carry over after 1941, in respect of the neAv construction programmes of 1941 and earlier years on the New Standard Fleet basis, would amount to no less than  105 millions. Even when the Fleet has been built up to the New Standard, the annual stabilised cost of maintaining it will be very great.  The latest figures, given in 1937, were as follows : Annual stabilised cost.   millions.D.R.C. Fleet     ..................        88. New Standard Fleet.........      ......      104*These figures may be, and probably are, now considerably higher, and show the immense burden which even the D.R.C: Fleet will throw permanently on our resources.25. This is, perhaps, a convenient point at which to state that, if I have understood his views correctly, the First Lord is now disposed to regard a system of rationing the Defence Departments as impossible to defend. In his view, the first duty of the Government is to ensure adequate defences. The right course, therefore, is to decide first upon what is necessary to ensure the continuance of the Empire, and then to enquire as to the means of meeting the cost. Further, in the First Lord&apos;s opinion, it is easier to ascertain what are adequate defences than what are the country&apos;s financial resources; and the danger of under-rating the former is greater than the danger of over-rating the latter, since the one may lead to defeat in war and complete destruction, whereas the other can only lead to severe embarrassment, heavy taxation, lowering of the standard of living and reduction of the social services.26. It is, of course, clear that acceptance of these views would involve a reversal of the decisions reached by the Cabinet on my earlier reports dealing with defence expenditure in future years. For my part, while I recognise that changing, circumstances may well justify some alteration in the maximum sum which may have to be regarded as available for all defence purposes over the 5 years 1937-41, I do not think that there is any alternative to some system of rationing if we are to ensure the best distribution of our available resources in accordance with a single defence policy.III. Standard of the Fleet.27. Since Naval expenditure is mainly governed by the size of the fleet, it is necessary first to examine this question. Reference has been made earlier in this paper to &quot; the D.R.C. Fleet &quot; and &quot; the New Standard Fleet.&quot; Some explanation of these terms and of the position in regard to this matter is called for.28. The Defence Requirements Sub-Committee, in November, 1935, stated (paragraph 30 of their third Report, volume 1, D.R.C. 37) as follows : &quot; Since 1932 the standard of naval strength has, for practical purposes, been based on the following formula : &apos;&quot; We should be able to send to the Far East a Fleet sufficient to provide &apos; cover &apos; against the Japanese Fleet: we should have sufficient additional forces behind this shield for the protection of our territory and mercantile marine against Japanese attack : at the same time we should be able to retain in European waters a force sufficient to act as a deterrent and to prevent the strongest European Naval Power, from obtaining control of our vital Home terminal areas while we can make the necessary redispositions.&quot;* Without taking account of the possible economies detailed in paragraphs 23-27 of D.P. (P.) 3.
29. The Committee recommended that, in view of the coming increase in German naval power combined with continuing anxiety about the safety of our possessions in the Far East we should aim at a New Standard strength defined as follows : -&quot; (i) To enable us to place a Fleet in the Far East fully adequate to act on the defensive and to serve as a strong deterrent against any threat, to our interests in that part of the globe. &apos;&apos; (ii) To maintain in all circumstances in Home Waters a force able to meet the requirements of a war with Germany at the same time.&quot; Included in (i) and (ii) should be the forces necessary in all parts of the world, behind the cover of the main fleets, to protect our territories and merchant ships against sporadic attack.&quot;   (Paragraph 140 (7) of D.R.C. 37, Volume I.)30. They recommended that the Government should accept this New Standard in principle, and instruct the Admiralty to work out the programme required to give effect to it as soon as the necessary data were available. In the meantime, the Committee made it clear that the Naval Construction set out in their report was limited to the &quot; existing approved standard &quot; of Naval strength. The programmes of construction recommended in the Committee&apos;s, report were based on this standard, which has therefore come to be referred to as the D.R.C. Standard.31. The Ministerial Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements (U.P.R. (D.R.) 9), while agreeing generally to the new construction programmes put forward in this Report, recommended that approval for the proposed New Standard of naval strength should be reserved until the practical effects could be more precisely estimated in the light of a further report to be supplied by the Admiralty (paragraph 8).32. A memorandum (D.P. (P.) 3) was submitted by the Admiralty to the Defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committee in May 1937. It set out in detail the number of ships in each category regarded as necessary by the Admiralty to give effect to the New Standard, together with particulars of the reductions which j could be effected in the event of possible agreement with Japan or improved&apos; relations with Germany. The Admiralty also indicated certain methods by which the cost of the New Standard Fleet might be reduced, and certain reductions which they thought might safely be accepted on the full numbers of ships required.33. The Defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committee, while noting the gravity of the Naval situation as revealed by the report, decided in view of the immense implication of the proposals to postpone the formulation of definite recommenda-tions. No decision was therefore reached by that Committee, and the New Standard has never been adopted by the Government.34. In the meantime, the Government decided in three successive years (1936, 1937 and 1938) to lay down much larger programmes of New Construction than those proposed in the D.R.C. Report. In consequence, by the end of this year we shall have laid down, except for capital ships, very nearly the whole of the major vessels which, under the D.R.C. proposals, were to be spread over the seven programmes of 1936 to 1942. The latest estimated total cost of the three approved 1936, 1937 and 1938 programmes is over  169 millions as against the D.R.C. estimate of just under  200 millions for the seven programmes 1936-1942. The Admiralty state that, on the basis of present prices, this figure of  200 millions would now represent  234 millions.35. It should be added that the increased programmes laid down in the three years 1936, 1937 and 1938 were approved on the understanding that they represented the acceleration of an already approved programme, and did not commit the Government to any higher standard.36. A decision must now be taken as to the size of the Fleet which the Admiralty should build up over the next few years. Is the D.R.C. Standard to be rigidly adhered to in which case there would be a virtual cessation of building in certain classes of ships (including destroyers and cruisers) for a number of years or are the Admiralty to be authorised to lay down ships in the next few years which involve an advance upon the D.R.C. Standard? If so, how much should that advance be?
37. For purposes of comparison I append a table prepared by the Admiralty showing :-(A) Their estimated strategical requirements.(B) The D.R.C. Fleet.(C) The proposed New Standard Fleet.(D) The strength of the Fleet in completed vessels in 1942, (i) if we proceed at what the Admiralty regard as the maximum rate; (ii) if we adhere strictly to the D.R.C. Standard.38. I should, perhaps, at this stage, summarise some of the main points made by the First Lord in regard to this matter.&apos;In the first place, he takes exception to the view that the D.R.C. Fleet is something which has the approval of the Cabinet, whereas the New Standard Fleet is an unauthorised project. He thinks it would be more accurate to say that since 1936 we have been working on a hand to mouth policy without any decision as to the ultimate strength of the Fleet. He points out that the D.R.C. Standard is broadly equivalent to the one-power standard to which we worked in the post-war years of Treaty limitation. That standard was based on a policy of preparing for a situation in which we might be compelled to fight Japan in the Far East, at the same time maintaining in home waters forces sufficient for the defence of these islands. In recent years, however, Germany has emerged as a first-class Naval Power and quantitative limitation by treaty has ceased to exist. The Admiralty contend that our Naval policy remains unaltered and that the New Standard represents merely the greater force required to maintain this policy in altered circumstances.39. The First Lord also wishes to emphasise that, in his view, the importance of Naval supremacy to the British Empire has been in no way diminished by the invention of flying. If Great Britain were defeated at sea, no Air Force could save her from destruction, nor would any hostile Air Force be necessary in order to bring about such destruction.40. As I have indicated elsewhere in this paper, I think that a decision on the size of the Fleet is overdue, and I do not think that there is much to be gained at this stage by discussion as to what constitutes the existing approved Govern-ment policy in this matter. The position in this respect may be fairly summarised as follows.41. When the D.R.C. report was approved, His Majesty&apos;s Government had in mind that it might be necessary to have a larger Fleet. At the same time, the D.R.C. Fleet represents the limits of the Fleet hitherto expressly authorised. It is to be noted that the Government Rearmament Programme as announced in March 1936 was based on acceptance of a Fleet of this size. For example, it was stated in the White Paper of March 1936 [Cmd. 5107], that in cruisers, the aim was to increase the total to 70, of which 60 would be under-age and 10 over-age.42. Looking at the matter from a practical point of view, what matters most is the programme for expansion of the Fleet to be carried out in say the next three years.43. The cost of the New Construction programmes laid down in the last three years has been as follows :  1936...............       47 millions*1937   .............    ....       62 millions*1938    ...............    .  47 millions[It is worth while to note that the normal annual replacement programme of the D.R.C. Fleet was estimated in 1935 to be.  16^ millions. With increased prices, I suppose this figure might now be  20 millions.]44. In the discussions which took place about the 1938 New Construction Programme the First Lord represented that any falling-off from the standard set* The original estimates for 1936 and 1937 have since risen to  53 millions and  69 millions respectively owing, eg., to increased prices.
by the enlarged New Construction Programme of recent years would be taken as evidence of a slackening in the vigour and tempo of our Rearmament effort.45. It must be remembered, however, that the expenditure on New Construction extends over three or four years, and does not reach its peak until the second or third year. According to figures recently submitted by the First Lord, it would appear that even if no New Construction were to be started in 1939 (and I am not suggesting this course), we should still be spending  10 millions more in 1939 on New Construction than in the current year, and  23 millions more in 1939 than in 1937.46. We are, in fact, already committed to a very high peak of expenditure on New Construction over the next two or three years, and it must be a matter for serious consideration whether it is right, or indeed practicable, to add still further to that peak.IV. Other Items of Expenditure.47. While the issue dealt with in the preceding section constitutes the main point for decision, other items of large expenditure are involved, which account for a considerable proportion of the excess expenditure, whether on the basis of the D.R.C. fleet or of the New Standard fleet, over my tentative allocation.48. In the forecasts of the quinquennium 1937-1941, the following estimates were given of Navy expenditure under the heading &quot; Maintenance, Materiel&quot; :  Forecast of PresentAugust, 1937. forecast. Increase.  millions.   millions.   ,        millions.D.R.C. Fleet    ......      162-9 206 43-1New Standard Fleet ...      164-5 207-8 43-349. The increase in the expenditure under this head is no doubt largely accounted for by the five measures of defence against air attack put forward by the First Lord in his paper CP. 92 (32).   These measures are :  Already-Total cost.      sanctioned.  millions.          millions.(1) Underground storage of oil fuel       ...      ...      13-5 3-5(2) Underground storage of ammunition ...       ...        5-0 nil.(3) Rearming of certain old cruisers and destroyers, &amp;c, with anti-aircraft armament for tradeprotection      ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        7-9 -6(4) Conversion of old 12-pdr. guns into high-angle armament   for   defensive   equipment   ofmerchant ships        ...      .....      ...        1-4 1-4(5) Duplication of R.N. Cordite factory ...       ...        3-4 nil.50. As stated in paragraph 11, the Cabinet invited the First Lord to consider whether these proposals could be brought within the share of the  1,570 millions provisionally allotted to the Admiralty, and meanwhile postponed a decision in regard to them. Subsequently, however, it was represented that the Admiralty attached the highest importance to item 4 in this list, namely, -conversion of 12-pounder guns for merchant ships, and that this service would have to be met whatever the ultimate decision regarding the ration might be. It was accordingly sanctioned, on the understanding that the expenditure involved was not by way of an addition to the ration, and that something else would have to be omitted to make room for it.51. Another item of substance is in connection with aircraft carriers, of which it is proposed to have 14 under the New Standard, and of which 6 have been laid down in the last four years. Whether this part of the programme is essential I am not competent to discuss. To the extent that aircraft carriers can be spared for trade protection, this may, perhaps, not be without some hearing on the number of cruisers needed for this purpose.
52.   I should also invite attention to the substantial forecaston the expansion of the Fleet Air Arm over the quinquennium, April 1937-March 1942 :-Forecast of PresentAugust, 1937.       forecast. Increase.  millions.          millions.          millions.D.E.C. Fleet      ......      22-4 35-9 13-5New Standard Fleet     ...      26-8 38-1 11-3V.53. So far, I have, for the most part, confined myself to an attempt to-summarise the main issues as I see them. It will, perhaps, be of some assistance to my colleagues if I set out the direction in which my mind is moving.54. In submitting their proposals for the number of ships in each category under the proposed New Standard of Naval Strength, the Naval Staff have done no more than carry out the instructions given to them by the Government that they should work out the programme required to give effect to the proposed New Standard &quot;(see paragraphs 27-33 above). I do not think that any of my colleagues will wish to question the technical advice, given by our expert advisers, that a Fleet of the size proposed is necessary to afford us security on the basis that we may be called upon to carry out the policy proposed.55. It is clear, however, that the cost of the proposed New Standard Fleet would strain our available resources. As I see the matter, the choice of courses before us is as follows : 56. On the one hand, it is open to us to decide that, notwithstanding the cost involved, it is essential that we should have a Fleet of the size proposed by the Admiralty in order to be able to carry out effectively the policy on which the proposed New Standard is based. It seems clear that, if we adopt this course, large countervailing economies would have to be made, either in the field of defence, or in the social services.57. On the other hand, it is open to us to decide that we are unable to meet the full cost of the Admiralty proposals. In that case two courses are open to us : -Either we must shape our policy to avoid the double contingency for which the New Standard Fleet is proposed.Or else we can decide that, while the policy in general should not be modified, we must attempt to carry out that policy with more slender resources than those deemed to be adequate by the Naval experts. In this connection, it is worth pointing out that even if we were to adopt the Admiralty proposals in principle, some years must elapse before we could attain the Fleet standard now proposed by the Admiralty.58. It must, of course, be clearly recognised that if we decide on a course which involves the adoption of a smaller Fleet than is recommended by our technical advisers as necessary to give adequate security on the basis of a given policy, then the responsibility for the decision taken rests upon the shoulders of His Majesty&apos;s Ministers.59. It is tempting to take the line that, in the present confused state of the world, we are bound to take short views, and that the best course may be that we should do all we can to strengthen our hands in the next two or three years, without paying too meticulous regard to the financial situation. We should, in effect, regard the costs to be incurred in these years as something which is wholly exceptional and does not reflect our normal needs or commitments. This raises very wide issues which have been previously discussed in the Cabinet. This line of argument, however, seems to me to be less applicable to the Navy than to any other branch of our defence preparations. Large warships take several years to build. Further, the training of the personnel to man them occupies, I understand,, considerably longer than the period of construction of ships. The Navy, too, is manned on a long-service basis, unlike the short-service basis which has been adopted in the Air Force.  Broadly speaking, I think that it is almost impossible,.
and certainly entirely unbusinesslike, to deal with our Naval needs upon the basis of a short-term policy. We cannot hope to find an easy way out of bur difficulties by a short-term programme of rapid expansion, to be followed, if need be, by rapid contraction. Further, it would be wrong to build up the Navy at great expense over the rearmament period to such a size that it would be clearly quite beyond our means to maintain the Fleet once it had been built up to the new level.60. I have reached the conclusion that, having regard to the extent of the demands likely to be made on our available resources, and in particular to the increased demands likely to be made by the Air, which at the present time is of the utmost importance, the proposed New Standard of naval strength is impossible of attainment and that we must rest content with something substantially less.   I recommend that this decision should be made.61. Assuming, for the moment, that the recommendation in the preceding paragraph is accepted, we have next to consider what standard, short of the New Standard, the Admiralty should aim at. With some diffidence, but to facilitate discussion, I set out some of the points which occur to me.62. On the political side, account must no doubt be taken of the present position in the Far East. Japan may, I suppose, be somewhat exhausted by the invasion of China and the risks to be apprehended in this quarter may, therefore, be somewhat reduced.63. Further, the political situation has changed considerably since the rearmament programme was launched. At that time our plans were envisaged in the light of a long term programme to make good our deficiencies. At the present time, however, our main anxiety is to strengthen our position to meet the immediate dangers of the next 2 years. It may therefore be asked whether our naval effort ought not to be directed so far as practicable to the completion of what is already in hand, and to the laying down of ships which can be completed within a short time, rather than to planning new programmes of ships which would take many years to complete. This line of argument is supported by the very large programmes laid down in 1936 and 1937, and approved for 1938.64. On the strategical and technical aspect I speak as a layman and I can do no more than suggest various possibilities which should perhaps be considered.65. Capital ships. Of our existing capital ships, 3 are post-war, 4 are being or have been completely modernised, and 4 have been partially modernised. By the end of the current year 7 new capital ships will have been laid down.It should perhaps be a matter for consideration whether, in view of the uncertainty as to the future building plans of other naval Powers in this category and to the large amount of money which has been put into the modernisation of our existing capital ships, it is desirable to continue building at any higher rate than say, 1 a year for the next few years. Assuming that all the ships which have been modernised or partly modernised are retained for the time being, even this programme will give us a substantial excess in capital ships over the D.R.C. figure of 15.66. Aircraft Carriers. These vessels cost  41 millions each. Further, the provision of the necessary complement of aircraft entails very high costs in the expansion of the Fleet Air Arm. It is a question whether a reduction in the Admiralty proposals under this head, thus effecting a considerable saving, cannot be made.67. Minor Vessels. The Admiralty propose a very considerable expenditure on the construction of minor vessels. Possibly something could be saved under this head, as, for instance, by taking up vessels in an emergency.68. On the financial side the standard of the Fleet which is to be laid down as the objective, must be capable of attainment within the limits of our available resources. It seems clear that, unless our defence plans are to be radically revised, some increase in the figure of  1,570 millions is inevitable. At the same time the extent of the increases now adumbrated above this figure, which was adopted by the Cabinet so lately as February last, is alarming.[17553] &apos; c

It will not, I think, be expected that I should express an opinion on each of these various factors, still less that I should attempt to produce for considera-tion an alternative fleet standard. Such a task would be beyond my province. I trust, however, that discussions with my colleagues will result in sufficiently definite conclusions to give cjear guidance to the Admiralty as to the general lines of the policy to be pursued. I contemplate that it should be an instruction to the Admiralty to work out detailed proposals, for submission to the Cabinet or OLD. at a later date, to give effect to the decisions to be reached by the Cabinet.T.
