SIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. COPY NO.     46 ^!.P. 185(38).CAB  IN B T.UNITED KINGDOM - UNITED STATES TRADE NEGOTIATIONS.Question of &quot;bringing Agreement into force during the Recess.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.In connection with the report from the Trade and Agriculture Committee /G.P. 134(38)J on my memorandum T.A.C,(36)53,   in which I gave a general picture of the kind of Agreement which may possibly emerge from the present negotiations with the United States, I should like a decision on the question of bringing such an Agreement into force during the Recess if the negotiations are concluded before next Session.My colleagues will be aware that the usual procedure is to lay an Agreement on the table of the House for 21 days before proceeding to ratification and the House has on more than one occasion been   informed that that is the procedure which the Government normally follow.     We have, however, always made it clear that this -procedure applies only when the House is in session,  and an exception has always been made for Agreements which are concluded at a time when it is not possible to give the House opportunity of debating them.    The latest statement on the subject was made by the Prime Minister in answer to a question on the 1st March when he said:    &quot;It is the practice of His Majesty&apos;s Government,  in order to provide opportunity for Parliamentary consideration in ordinary cases, to lay treaty engagements for 21 Parliamentary days before ratification by His Majesty in all cases when the continuance of the Parliamentary Session makes this course practicable.-1-
When it does not, or when considerations of urgency require ratification without this preliminary, action would he taken accordingly and Parliament would he notified as soon as may he afterwards.&quot;It 3.ppears possible that we may obtain an Agreement with the United States during the Recess - and, I hope, early in the Recess.      In such circumstances, it would obviously be better not to allow any appreciable interval to pass before bringing the Agreement into force* and I think that the United States Government would themselves expect the Agreement to be made effective as soon as possible after signature.      I am making enquiries of the Delegation in Washington on this point immediately and I hope to have the reply in time to communicate to my colleagues before the next Cabinet meeting.I realise that it is unfortunate that it may be necessary to bring into force an Agreement of such importance as this one without giving an opportunity to the House of Commons to debate it, and I should naturally have felt much more happy about the position had it been possible to complete the Agreement while the House was still sitting.      We are, however, faced with a choice of evils.5      The signing of the Agreement and its publication long in advance of its coming into force is undesirable on many grounds, one of the most important being that trace would inevitably tend to be held up on both sides on the goods in the schedules until the new duties were made effective.So far as this country is concerned, legislation is required only in respect of two minor items - turpentine and patent leather, if in the end concessions are ma.de on these particular articles.      It would be necessary therefore to make special provision in the Agreement, leaving the new duties
on those two products to he Drought into effect at a later date.    Otherwise the new duties can he made effective by Order.In the circumstances,&apos; I should be grateful if authority could   be given for the necessary Orders to be made and for the Agreement to be brought into effect,   as soon as possible after signature,  on the authority of the Prime   Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Foreign Secretary and myself,  or as many of those Ministers as it may be possible to consult when the Agreement is concluded.O.F.G.S.Board of Trade,22nd,  July,  1958.
