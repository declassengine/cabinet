THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT).SECRET. CP.   184 (38).CABINET. COMMITTEE ON TRADE AND AGRICULTURE. THE UNITED KINGDOM - UNITED STATES TRADE AGREEMENT.REPORT.1. We attach (Appendix I to this Report) a memorandum circulated to us on the 16th. -July last &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade to which is attached a Memorandum of the same date entitled &apos;Memorandum Summarising the Position of the Negotiations&apos;  (hereinafter called the Summarising Memorandum) setting out the position which had then been reached in the negotiations for a Trade Agreement with the United States.    It will be observed that in order to avoid troubling his colleagues unnecessarily during the Recess the President asked for authority to proceed with the signature of an Agreement with the United States on the general basis indicated in the Summarising Memorandum,  subject to his being satisfied that a fair settlement had been reached on the questions still outstanding.      The President would regard an Agreement on this basis as one which could be justified on strictly commercial grounds and at the same time as a really substantial contribution to economic appeasement.2. We also attach (Appendix II to this Report) afurther Note dated 19th July,  1938, by the President of the Board of Trade covering a copy of a Telegram dated 17th.July from the British Delegation at Washington from which it would appear that the position has again changed for the worseCOPY NO.Lh 0
since the Summarising Memorandum was written.    The American negotiators who,  in view of the forthcoming Elections, are being subjected to considerable political pressure, have in effect reverted to the position they took up when the negotiations began earlier in the year and are now maintaining that it is not merely a question of reaching some settlement on five or six important agricultural items but that &apos;our offers taken as a whole are inadequate and involve little direct sacrifice on the part of United Kingdom industry or agriculture,  and that they must press us until we are ready to make sacrifices corresponding to those which they are prepared to make&apos;.3. As will be seen (pages 2 and 3 of Appendix II) theBritish Delegation have strongly challenged these latest American contentions but are of opinion that while there may be considerable elements of bluff in the American attitude, the Americans genuinely consider our offers inadequate and will continue to press us to the utmost, both on our offer as a whole and individually on a number of the more important items.    ^he Delegation accordingly recommend,  as the only way of meeting the American tactics, that we should now decide definitely how far we are prepared to go,  subject to an agreement satisfactory as a whole, and then to be absolutely firm even at a risk of a breakdown,4. The position in regard to the proposed UnitedKingdom Tariff concessions to the United States of America will be found on pages 6-16 of the Summarised Memorandum (Appendix I).      As regards the more important items in respect of which the Americans are specially pressing for further and better concessions,  the following considerations should be noted :-
Machine Tools.A reduction of duty is being resisted on the ground that it is essential for defence purposes to avoid anything which might reduce the capacity of our machine tool industry.Motor Oars.It is proposed to consolidate the present rate of duty for cars over 30 horse-power, the class in which American manufacturers have the greatest interest and in which German competition is least to be feared. Track-laying Tractors.The duty was raised two years ago to 33-j^o on the recommendation of the Import Duties Advisory Committee in the face, however,  of some opposition from the farmers.    These tractors are only manufactured by one British firm which has so far failed to produce the goods.    We have invited the Departments concerned to ascertain what basis, if any, there is for the allegation that the Committee gave the manufacturers to understand that they would have a three years clear run in order to establish them-selves on a sound footing before a reduction of duty would be considered.    In any case the Government would not be bound by any undertaking of this kind which the Committee may have given.    The British Delegation at Washington recommend that the duty be reduced to 2&amp;%. Typewriters.We have offered a reduction from  4.10.Od.  to  3.10.0d.  per machine on full size typewriters
valued at over  6,  the class in which the United Kingdom industry is most firmly established.Timber (Douglas Fir).For the reasons given on page 10 of the Summarised Memorandum it is not possible to concede the reduction of duty on lumber of Douglas fir, a concession to which,  for political reasons,  the Americans attach great importance.Tobacco.For the reasons given on page 11 of the Summar-ised Memorandum any immediate concession on tobacco is out of the question.    Nor,  apart from other objections, would it be appropriate in an agreement for 3 years to include the undertaking which the Americans demand that we should reduce the present margin of Empire preference in 1942 when the Ottawa guarantees expire. Ham.It may be possible to go somewhat further towards meeting the American request for a larger quantitative guarantee than we have so far offered. Flour.The Americans realise that now that their negotiations with Australia cannot at present be proceeded with, there is little possibility of obtaining Australian consent to a concession on flour,  and in any case the British Delegation have repeatedly made it clear to them that such a con-cession cannot be contemplated from our own point of view.
Lard.The position in regard to lard is discussed at greater length later in this Report.5.        We have carefullyvconsidered the whole positionas set out in Appendices I and II in the light offurther explanations given to us by the President of theBoard of Trade and of the views of the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries, who has drawn our attentionto the objections, from the point of view of the homeagricultural interests, to an Agreement on the basis ofthe Summarised Memorandum and to the political consequences which may result from those objections.     Inthe opinion of a majority of the Committee it is highly desirable from various points of view, including theimprovement of international relations and of the further-ing of general economic appeasement, that an Agreement withthe United States on the general lines indicated in theSummarised Memorandum should be concluded, and we accordingly recommend the Cabinet :To authorise the President of the Board of Trade to proceed, should he find it necessary or desirable to do so during the Recess, with the signature of an Agreement with the United States on the general basis indicated in the Summarised Memorandum (Appendix I), subject of course to his being satisfied that a fair settle-ment has been reached on the questions still outstanding and subject also to the Cabinet&apos;s decision in regard to the question whether any, and if so what, further con-cessions may in the circumstances explained in the following paragraphs, be offered in regard to lard.6* We attach as Appendices III and IV, Memorandacirculated to us by the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries
respectively in regard to the ouestion of lard inthe United Kingdom - United States negotiations07,, The arguments for and against the proposal thatthe British Delegation shotild he authorised to offer toreduce the duty on lard to 3/- or, in the last resort,to 2/6d. per cwto may he summarised as follows.In favour of the reduction of duty0The President of the Board of Trade maintained strongly that, for the following reasons, a reduction In the duty on lard to 5/- or, in the last resort, to 2/6d per cwtc ought to he agreed to0(l) The pressure on lard, was due to the fact that, for political reasons, the Americans insisted on substantial concessions to pig iDroducers and that we were unable to meet thern to anything like the extent they had hoped on hams.(2) The specific duty proposed must be assessed in the light of the facts,  (a) that in the last three years lard supplies had been abnormally low and prices correspondingly high owing to the shortage of pig products in the United States and,  (b) that supplies were now gradually returning to normal so that a falling price level was to be expected,,     On the basis of recent import values the 4/- proposed by the Minister of Agriculture involved no reduction in duty and prices were expected to fall further.     On the basis of import values in the years 1932 to 1934, before the American drought,-4/- constituted an actual increase in duty.(3)  As regards the home producer, it was very unlikely that the duty affected, the volume of imports in practice and, in any case, he understood that - a difference of as much as 1/- in the price of lard made a difference of not more than Id. on the price of a pig, so that there was only 1-g-do per pig between him and the Minister of Agriculture.
- (4)  The Minister&apos;s objection appeared therefore to be mainly political.      In the President&apos;s view it should not be difficult to avoid the charge that the further fall in the price of lard, which was expected to result from the return of lard, shipments to normal, was due to any change which might be made in the duty, since the Minister would be able to point to the fact that the decline in lard prices had begun in the Autumn of 1937, i0e. long before there was any. question of an alteration in the duty.(5) The view of the Delegation in Washington was that the reduction in the duty on lard was now vital to the success of the negotiations.     He could not guarantee that such a reduction would ensure an agreement, but he felt reasonably sure that without it no agreement would be possible.Against any further reduction of duty.In the view of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries the question of lard could not be considered apart from the general effect of the negotiations on agriculture.   . While he agreed that a Trade Agreement with the United States was of the utmost importance on general grounds, it was essential that it should not be open to the criticism that the major concessions had been made at the expense of agriculture, an industry which already feels that it is inadequately protected and all the benefits secured by manufacturing industries.Comparison was bound to be made between the willingness of His Majesty&apos;s Government   to whittle away the small amount of protection given to home agriculture, compared with the retention by the United States of a high tariff system^
The Minister of Agriculture contracted the sacrifices expected of United Kingdom agriculture with the criteria applied to industrial goods in respect of which, our concessions were stated in the President&apos;s memorandum (T.A.C.(36) 53) to he generally limited to those in which the United States already held a preponderating share of the United Kingdom market and those in which the United Kingdom industry was already so firmly established that a small reduction in its tariff protection was not likely to do any harm.     There was nothing in the Agreement of advantage to our agriculture (except insignificant concessions on grass and mustard seed), hut agriculture was already hearing half the duty reductions valued at  10 millions on 1936 figures.     In that year, moreover, wheat imports from the United States were valued at only  21,000 and these figures therefore ingored the enormous advantages that would accrue to United States wheat growers when imports of wheat from the United States returned to the more normal figure of about  8 millions. In the first half of 1938, imports of wheat from the United States amounted to  5.4 millions and with the anticipated very heavy wheat crop this season, the trade may be expected to return fully to the normal level.     With this adjustment agriculture&apos;s proportion would be  13 millions out of  18 millions, i,e, 70 per cento     In spite of this already disproportionate share of the burden, agriculture was being asked to acquiesce in further concessions on lard, hams and canned beans and might be pressed to. give further ground in respect of copies, while the one American request that w^old benefit the home farmer, viz:- for a reduction in the 33^ per cent, duty on track laying tractors, had so far been refused, although it was stated to be one to which the United States attached roal importance.
As a matter of general principle it was unreasonable to ask this one industry to accept further diminution of the very moderate tariff and other protection that it at present enjoyed.     The agricultural situation was very difficult at the present time both politically and economically.     Prices were falling;    in particular the decline in the price of sheep - the sheet anchor of livestock farmers - was very serious and there was little that the Government could do to relieve the situation. Already the agricultural industry was contrasting unfavourably the attitude of the Government towards agriculture and that adopted towards the motor trade when threatened with competition from Opel cars.     There seemed to him no reason why the Government should not agree to reduce the duty on cars over 30 horse power from 33-g- per cent, to 20 per cent. - the average level of duties on manufactured goods.     The Government would still be free to deal with the Opel menace which was restricted to cars of lower horse power and such action would be a valuable concession to the United States which mainly sends cars of high horse power.     Similarly it seemed inequitable that in the interests of only one firm, which had so far failed to fill the requirements of the United Kingdom farmer, the request for a reduction in the duty on track laying tractors should be met with a blank refusal.     Concessions on these items and on typewriters which the Delegation had also recommended in their latest telegram (circulated as T.A.C.  (36)  55), should help to lessen the pressure for further concessions on agricultural products and would be of great help politically in defending the concessions already offered on such products.
It was true that the Dominions, particularly Canada, would suffer from some of the concessions on agricultural products, hut even in the case of apples the fall in price that might he anticipated from a reduction in the duty and a consequent increase in United States supplies would affect home production averaging 5g- million cwts. in the last three years,- compared with average Canadian imports in that period of only about 2% million cwts.The President of the Board of Trade was urging, in particular,  that the duty on lard should be reduced to 2s. 6d0 per cwt. from the present rate of 10 per cent. ad valorem which was equivalent to 5s. 6d. per cwt. on the average import values of the last three years.     Since then values had fallen and the Minister of Agriculture expressed his willingness to offer a rate of 4s. Od. per cwt. which represented not more than 7-g- per cent, on the average values in each of the past eighteen years except during the slump years 1931-34.     A serious objection to a further concession on this ::tem was the effect on the narrow margin allowed to curers under the Bacon Industry Bill.     This margin mainly depended on the return on offals, of which lard is the most Important, and had already been much reduced owing to the fall in lard prices since the Bill was drafted,     Recently a deputation from the Bacon Marketing Board had pressed for quantitative regulation to avert a further decline, and the concession proposed would be regarded as a breach of faith on the part of the Government towards the bacon curers.The Minister of Agriculture urged his colleagues not to press the agricultural industry too hard and to seek to satisfy American desires by concessions on items
other than lard, for which the United States were pressing with equal insistence.     The amount at stake on lard was relatively unimportant to the United States hog industry, hearing in mind the substantial advantages of the accompanying guarantee of no quantitative regulation and the proposed concessions on hams, hut from the psychological point of view it was vital to the success of the Bacon Industry Bill.     It was no exaggeration to say that the effect on the curer&apos;s margin of the further reduction in the duty now proposed, to which any subsequent fall in prices would, doubtless be attributed, might imperil   the new bacon scheme at the outset.     It was incredible that failure to reduce the duty on lard from 4s. Od. to 2s. 6d. per1 cwt. would, jeopardise the negotiations especially having regard to the great benefits which American agriculturists would, derive from the concessions already offered.8. A suggestion is being examined that as an alterna-tive to our present offer to reduce the duty to 4s. Sd. a cwt. we might offer a reduction of the duty, if necessary, down to 2so 6d. a ewt0 accompanied by the.withdrawal of our offer to guarantee unqualified freedom from quantitative regulation for lard.      In other words the Americans might be given the choice of a duty of 4s. 6d. a cwt. plus a guarantee of freedom from quantitative regulation, or a duty of, say, 2s. 6d. a cwt. with no such guarantee.9. It will, of course, be realised that even if itshould be decided to make an offer to the Americans on these lines, the prospects of persuading them to accept it are by no means encouraging, and that in this event the
q,vj.estion would again have to he faced whether an unconditional offer to reduce the duty to 2s, 6d. a cwt. should, in the last resoi*t he made.10.       In view of its great importance we did not feel able to reach any conclusion or to make any recommendation to the Cabinet on this matter, and accordingly we decided to reserve for determination by the Cabinet the question whether any, and if so what, improved offer should be made in regard to lard.Signed on behalf of the Committee (Sgd.)

UNITED KINGDOM - UNITED STATES TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. General Position. Note by the President of the Board of Trade.On the 2nd June, I circulated to the Committee a memorandum (T.A.C. (36)51.) summarising the position which had then been reached in the negotiations for a trade agreement with the United States.At that time the position was anything but satisfactory, The United States representatives were still making demands for concessions much in excess of what our Delegation had . indicated as possible,  and in return had made offers to us which could only be regarded as inadequate and as insufficient to justify the concessions on our part which had been provisionally promised or indicated during the course of the negotiations.I am glad to say that, as a result of constant discussions over the past few weeks, real progress has now been made.      The United States representatives are at last showing themselves more reasonable both in their demands on us and in the extent of the concessions they are prepared to offer in return;   but there are still a number of difficult questions to be settled and it is not possible to give a general picture of the scope which the Agreement is expected to cover.As, however, I am anxious that my colleagues should have the latest information, even though the  picture;, is incomplete, I attach a memorandum summarising the position now reached.      I am unable to give any definite indication of the time it will/1 ake
take to secure settlement of outstanding points .. &quot;but on prer.er.t information I think it most unlikely that finality can he achieved until some time in August,,      As I do not wish to trouble my colleagues unnecessarily during the Recess    I should be glad of authority to proceed with the signature of an Agreement with the United States on the general basis indicated in the attached memorandum, subject, of course, to my being satisfied, that a fair settlement has been reached on the questions still outstanding.,    I woiilcl regard an Agreement on this basis as one which can be justified on strictly commercial grounds and at the sane tine as a really substantial contribution to economic appeasement,,OcPoG-oS.Board of Trade,16th July . &apos;19330
MEMORANDUM SUMMARISING THE POSITION OP THE.NEGOTIATIONS,Proposed U.S. Tariff concessions to the United Kingdom.The United States offers of Tariff concessions to the United Kingdom as they stand at present consist of certain proposals submitted on the 25th April and of the improvements subsequently orooosed (after further discussions with the United Kingdom Delegation)   on a . tentative basis as part of a generally satisfactory Agreement.      The offers as a \7hole are, therefore,  to be regarded as contingent upon adequate counter-concessions by the United Kingdom, and they are subject to the approval of United States Ministers.Imports into the United States from the United Kingdom in 1936 were valued at $199 million, divided as follows:-Dutiable.......... . ,...... $115 millionFree of duty..............$ 84 million the value of the United Kingdom trade in that year which is covered by the concessions offered may be classified as shewn in the table below.      Strict accuracy cannot be claimed for the figures, which are necessarily estimates basedto a certain extent on incomplete data.Value of Imports from U.K.  in 1956A. Reductions of duty ..... $ 55 millionB. Conventionalisations ofexisting duties.......$ 32       &quot;C. Conventionalisation of present freedom fromduty................... $ 48       &quot;$135       &quot;It will be seen that reductions of duty are offered on some $55 million worth of United Kingdom goods, on the basis of trade in 1936.      The reductions naturally vary in extent, and the following table shows the estimated value of the import (on 1936 figures) which would be covered by the different degrees of reduction shown.      The maximum reduction permissible under United States law is 50 per cent.
Value of imports from the U.K., &quot;&quot;^Ooo&apos;,000Covered by reductions of17 17 14 740/o or more30/c - 40-,* 20,; - 30-o under 20/o55This represents a notable improvement on the original United States offers of 26th April and, in the opinion of the Delegation,  constitutes in the main a satisfactory basis for the conclusion of an equitable Agreement having   -regard to what we may be in a position to offer.      It is recognised that in certain particulars the United States offers still leave something to be desired.     In a few important cases, there is room for hope that improved offers may be forthcoming.Altogether, over 600 rates of duty are the subject of concessions.      It should be borne in mind that, outside the large textile groups - cottons, woollens and linens - our trade withthe U.S.A.  consists very largely of a number of diverse items, which, though relatively small taken individually, make up a very considerable aggregate.     On many of these small items we are offered valuable concessions.The most   -important items in the offers to conventionalise existing duties are   whisky ($27 million) and jute burlaps (03 million).      The duty on the former has already been reduced by 50 per cent, by the United States Trade Agreement with Canada, but the United Kingdom is increasingly the main beneficiary;    and we cannot rely on the continued conventionalisation of the duty in a U.S.A. - Canadian Agreement.It is quite impossible to estimate what increase of trade might be expected to result if all the concessions now tentatively offered are confirmed, but over a very wide field progress would have been made towards realising the hopes of United Kingdom exporters.
Tho Immediately following paragraphs summarise the United. States offers in respect of certain classes of goods which arc of special interest.TEXTILES.    On cotton piece goods (our main interest in the Cotton Schedule)  the United States, after an unsatisfactory initial offer, have made a notable effort to meet us.    The concessions as they stand should bo of considerable help to our exporters and if wo can secure certain minor adjustments and improvements which we have suggested, they may prove to be of real value to Lancashire.    On other important cotton items, the concessions proposed.are generally satisfactory, except forcujptainsj_etc.,. .made on tho Nottingham lace-curtain machine (forwhich an improved offer is being sought), and Levers lace goodsa for which no concession is offered or can now be expected.   To compensate Nottingham, however, tho maximum reduction of the present    high - duty for bobbinet machine-made nets and nettings of cotton (an important trade) is offered.In the wool Schedule, -reductions of duty in which offer more scope for expansion of trade than any other, the items of outstanding importance are wool cloths and apparel.    In neither case is the present United States offer entirely satisfactory, more especially in that the concessions proposed for the cheaper classes of goods fall short of what we had looked for. It is hoped, however, that tho United States may yet be induced to make some moderate advance on the present offers, and so render the concession^ more acceptable to us.    As regards the specific duty Components of the compound duties on wool manufactures, which are intended to compensate the United States manufacturer for the duty on raw wool,  it is settled in principle that the Agreement shall provide for the adjustment of the specific rates to correspond with any reductions that may in future bo made in the duties on raw wool in subsequent trade agreements between the United States and other countries.    This provision is of importance.
As regards linen goods, our requests have been met, if not quite in full, to a very substantial extent.    The United States is our largest overseas market for linen goods and the concession offered in this group should be of real value to N. Ireland. The case of jute manufactures was one presenting peculiar difficulty, because little increase of trade seemed likely to result from duty reductions, and it was feared that concessions which Dundee might regard as adequate might incite the cotton interests in the United States to renew their attempts to penalise imports of jute and. jute products which are of vital concern to India,    In these circumstances, it was decided to concentrate on securing the conventionalisation of the low (revenue) duty on burlaps.    Dundee stands to gain from the concession offered for jute fabrics for padding or interlining. METALS AND MACHINERY.    Generally speaking, the concessions offered in this group are satisfactory;    they include, inter alia, proposals for card clothing of the kind principally imported from the United Kingdom, Diesel engines, textile and some other classes of machinery, and bicycles;    also cutlery, for which substantial reductions are offered on all items in which the United Kingdom has an interest, actual or potential, although in a few cases only is the United Kingdom the principal supplier to the United States.    The United States proposals for silver-plated ware and metal pens are, hov/ever, disappointing.    United Kingdom exporters of machinery have shewn comparatively little interest in the negotiations;    the concessions offered cover most of the products in respect of which representations were received.EARTHS, EARTHENWARE AND GLASSWARE;    Concessions which should be of considerable benefit to United Kingdom trade are offered for decorated earthenware  (plates, cups and saucers) and for bone china, which is a United Kingdom speciality.    There are
O 9 0 ^also duty; reductions for china clay (an important trade), and scientific articles and tubes of fused quartz and fused silica, though   in these cases the offers do not go so far as we should have liked.      After some hesitation, the United States have offered    (subject to the approval of the Defence Departments) a concession for photographic lenses    of a certain minimum value. PROVISIONS AND BEVERAGES;    In the provision class, fish is the most important item.     Satisfactory concessions are offered for canned herring, pickled and salted herring,  and kippered herring;    and all these proposals are of considerable importance to our trade.      Substantial reductions of duty are offered for orange marmalades and for jams and jellies;    and a smaller reduction for ground mustard,  for which the present duty is, however, at a very moderate level.      The offered consolidation of the present duty on whisky has already been, mentioned earlier in this Note, and is of the first importance having regard to the value of the United States market to the United Kingdom trade.      The Tariff duty on gin has already been reduced by 50 per cent, by the United States Agreement of 1956 with the Netherlands;    it is proposed to re-conventionalise the reduced duty in our Agreement.      As regards malt liquors,  it is proposed to conventionalise the present duty,  the United States being unable to offer a reduction   owing to legal difficulties arising from the fact that the Tariff duty was reduced by 50 per cent,  in 1935, under the &quot;flexible provisions&quot; of the Tariff Act of 1930.MISCELLANEOUS; There are several useful offers of concessions in the Paper and Books Section, of which the most important is the maximum reduction in the duty on books of foreign authorship.      For various kinds of leather in which the United Kingdom is interested as a supplier, we are offered
moderate reductions of duty, but it must be remembered that a considerable proportion of the existing duties is intended to compensate United   States tanners for the duty which they have to pay on raw hides.      The concessions offered cover a large volume- of United Kingdom trade, and should be of considerable value.      The United States representatives have agreed in principle that, if the duties on hides are reduced by any subsequent United States Trade Agreement, a corresponding further reduction shall be made in the duties on leather of the kinds for which concessions are now offered, to the United Kingdom.      For leather boots and shoes (welt), we are offered the maximum reduction of the present moderate duty on what is already a fairly large export trade to the United States.      On toys of specified kinds, we are offered a substantial (but not the maximum) reduction of the present very high duty.      The United Kingdom is only a minor supplier to the United States of toys as a whole, and we were not, therefore, in a very strong position to press for the maximum reduction even though our request was limited to a narrow range of toys.Proposed United Kingdom Tariff concessions to the U.S.A.The concessions which it is proposed to offer to the U.S.A. include tariff reductions covering imports from the U. SA.valued (on 1936 figures) at roughly  10 million, and. conventionalisations (i.e. undertakings to maintain free entry or not to increase the duty, as the case may be) covering imports valued at roughly  37 million.     Raw cotton, however, accounts for more than half of this total, and a number of other raw materials and foodstuffs are included in it.The United States have submitted a very long list of requests for tariff concessions on manufactured goods, and it
has heen found possible to offer a substantial number of concessions which will, I &quot;believe, facilitate trade without inflicting any serious damage on United Kingdom industry. The classes of goods on which tariff reductions have been offered moot readily are of two kinds:    those in,which the United States already hold, a preponderating share of the United Kingdom market and those in which the United Kingdom industry is already so firmly established that a small reduction in its tariff protection is not likely to do any harm.      Office machinery is an example of the first class and soap and varnish of the second.     Naturally, it has not been found possible to confine the concessions entirely to these classes of goods - indeed, if it were so    the Agreement could hardly be expected to lead to any substantial increase in trade - but where concessions have been proposed on classes of goods in which United Kingdom manufacturers experience competition in the home market from the United States, an attempt has been made, after consultation with the industries affected, to frame the concession in such a way that it will neither inflict serious damage on United Kingdom industry nor give greater advantages to other exporting countries than it does to the United States.The classes of manufactures in which the United States attach most importance to a concession are machinery, motor-cars, track-laying tractors, and typewriters.      In machinery, we have been able to find some 30 classes of machines on which reduction of duty can be offered besides others on which the present duty can be consolidated;    generally, the reduction proposed is from 20 to 15 per cent, ad valorem, but as many of these machines which are not procurable in the United Kingdom can be imported duty free under licence,
the concession is to some extent illusory.      Strong pressure from the United States for a reduction in duty on machine tools has heen resisted on the ground that it is essential for defence purposes to avoid anything which might reduce the capacity of our machine tool industry. The United States are the principal foreign supplier of motor-cars, hut although imports are not large compared with home production, a reduction of duty would clearly he difficult, in view of the growing competition from Germany, particularly in the low horse-power class.      It is, however, proposed to consolidate the present rate of duty for cars over 30 horse-power, the -class in which American manufacturers have the greatest interest and in which German competition is least to he feared.      On track-laying tractors, the duty was raised two years ago to 33-g- per cent, on the recommendation of the Import Duties Advisory Committee, in the face of some opposition from the farmers, and the Committee gave the manufacturers to understand that they would have three years&apos;  clear run in order to establish themselves on a sound footing before a reduction of duty would be considered.      In these circumstances, we have refrained from offering any reduction in the negotiations, but here again it is proposed to consolidate the present rate of duty.     In typewriters,    the United Kingdom industry is of comparatively recent growth, and the United States still supply a large proportion of the market.      The United Kingdom industry is strongly opposed to a tariff concession, but the present duty is a high one and it has been found necessary to offer a reduction from  4.10s. to  3.10s. per machine on full-sized
typewriters valued at over  6., the class in which the United Kingdom industry is most firmly established. Reductions of duty are also proposed for a varied range of other goods, including holts and nuts, engineers&apos; tools, machinery belting, women&apos;s shoes, oil varnishes, toilet preparations, gramophones and records,  soap and printers&apos; ink.      In some cases, the concession is confined to goods over a specified value,  in order to preserve the right to impose a minimum specific duty as a safeguard against cheap imports from other countries.The following&apos; table shows tho, value of the imports from the United States in 1936 of the principal classes of goods on which tariff concessions are proposed.Reductions. &apos;000.Lard...................... ......... 1,571Fresh fruit (apples and pears)  ..... 2,164Canned fruit (specified varieties).. 1,192Machinery (approximate) ...........* ls500Typewriters........................ 440Engineers&apos;  tools................... 180Women&apos;s shoes....................Other goods,  say................... 3,000Total (approx.)  ...........     10,000

(estimated) 800Other goods,  say................... 8,000Total (approx.)  ......  56,000Only two American requestss of any importance other than on agricultural products, are still outstanding:    these relate to softwood lumber and tobacco.    The U.S.A. have asked for a reduction of duty on lumber of Douglas fir, a concession to which, for political reasons, they attach great importance,. but this we cannot, in my view,, concede.    Douglas fir grows only in North America and though botanically distinct, is in practice used for the same purposes as other soft woods of which the Baltic countries are the chief suppliers, differing from them only in that it is available in larger sizes.    Consequently, a tariff reduction on Douglas fir v/ould inevitably give rise to claims by the Baltic countries that we should, on most-favoured-nation grounds, concede a similar reduction on other softwoods;    and such a claim could hardly be resisted.    Our trade agreement with Canada prevents us from reducing the 10% duty on softwoods without Canada&apos;  consent.      We, for our part,  could contemplate an all round reduction to 7-g$ in order to obtain a satisfactory agreement;    but Canada,  while agreeable to some tariff reduction on Douglas fir, will not agree to a similar reduction on other softwoods. All, therefore, that we can at themoment offer the U.S.A.  is an alternative specific duty which
would give some advantage to large sized timber. This matter is still under discussion at Washington with the Canadian and American representatives.On tobacco, an immediate concession to the U.S.A. is out of the question because we are bound by undertakings given at Ottawa to maintain the present margin of Empire preference (roughly 2/- per lb. on a full duty of about 10/-) until 1942; and an undertaking to reduce, or even not to increase, the general level of duty cannot be given in view of the importance of the tobacco duty as a source of revenue,The U.S.A.  are anprehensive as to the future of their tobacco trade to this country, which is valued at over  14 million a year, and they have asked for an undertaking to reduce the margin of preference in 1942 when the Ottawa guarantees exoire.   Apart, however, from the impossibility of forecasting what the needs of the Empire tobacco industries will be in 1942 - and Southern Rhodesia is very largely dependent on the tobacco trade for the maintenance of her economy - it is clearly inappropriate to include in an agreement for three years an undertaking which cannot take effect until after a lapse of four years.    It would seem, therefore, that all we can offer the U.S.A. on tobacco is an undertaking not to increase the margin of preference during the currency of the agreement.    As the present margin has not had the effect of reducing our imports from U.S.A, which have continued to increase in recent years, such an undertaking is not without value.    On the other hand, the latest reoort from Washington shows that it will be difficult to satisfy the U.S.A. by this undertaking.
On the agricultural side there is some reason to euppoee thai;- - 1 the Americans have advanced a good way from the position they took 1 up at the end of April (see my memorandum circulated as T.A.C.I(36) 51), and are no longer pressing for further concessions on such items as canned and dried fruits.      They are still concentrating on lard, hams and (to a lesser extent) flour.      There are also one or two minor points outstanding.The volume of trade covered in 1935 by the reductions on agricultural products which we have offered was  5 million, while the volume covered by consolidations was  6^- million.      These figures do not, however, give a complete picture since while no reduction in duty has been offered for hams, which are free of duty,  and of which the value is  li million, v/e are prepared to offer an increase in the quota which is equivalent.     Further, the 1936 figures do not give an adequate indication of the value of free entry for wheat since imports from the U.S.A., which vary greatly from year to year, were very low in 1936 ( 21,000) whereas in 1937 they were  1,631,000.     A number of these concessions are, of course, mainly at the expense of Dominion trado.As regards the three important outstanding items, I am circulating a separate memorandum on lard (T.A.C.  (36) 52).      On hams the Americans are pressing for a larger quantitative guarantee than we have so far offered;    and I understand that, following discussion between my Department and the Ministry of Agriculture,  it is possible that we may be able to go a little further.      This concession, however, depends first on our obtaining the agreement of Denmark and Poland (who have guaranteed shares of bacon and hams taken together) to new separate percentages of bacon and hams.      There has been rather more difficulty over this than I had expected but I am hopeful of getting agreement.Finally, as regards flour, I think the Americans realise that now that their negotiations with Australia cannot be proceeded with at present, there is little possibility of obtainingAustralian consent to a concession on flour and, in any case, the delegation have repeatedly made clear to them that such a concession   cannot be contemplated from our own point of view.-12-
The negotiations embrace Newfoundland and the ColEmpire as well as the United Kingdom.In the case of Newfoundland, provisional agreement has been reached between United States and Newfoundland representatives on a basis which the Newfoundland Commission of Government regards as satisfactory.    The concessions offered by the United States cover certain exports of real importance to Newfoundland, including wet salted cod. and pickled or salted herring, certain berries, fluorspar and sealskins.    Tho concessions on fish should be of particular benefit to the fishing industry which is in a parlous state.    In return Newfoundland is prepared to make concessions over a wide range of United States goods, including reductions in the duties on hams, lard and lard compounds, dried fruits, cotton piece-goods, certain clothing, hats and caps, and conventionalisation of the existing duty position in regard to flour,, salt beef and pork, fresh fruit, radio apparatus and certain machinery.    Certain of these concessions involve modifications of preferences guaranteed to the United Kingdom. In only a few cases, however, is this likely to affect United Kingdom export trade and on the only items of importance (cotton-piece-goods and.clothing) we are making cur consent contingent on satisfactory concessions by the United States to us on textiles.    In the case of goods subject to revenue duties, where the Newfoundland Government must retain freedom to increase duties if necessary,  the concessions to tho United States on certain items are likely to take the form of undertakings not to increase the margins of preference in favour of Empire goods beyond a fixed maximum amount or not to accord preferences where no preferences are at present given.
As regards the Colonies, the United States have now made provisional offers of concessions covering the majority of the requests submitted on behalf of the Colonial Empire.     As a large part of Colonial trade with the United States consists of raw materials and tropical products, the concessions for the most part are in the form of conventionalisations of duty free entry, important examples of which are asphalt and bitumen,  certain essential oils,  spices, gums and resins, coir fibre and rubber. There are also some useful duty reductions of value to a number of Colonies,  including those in respect of flowers,  celery, sponges, plumbago,  coconuts, limes and mangrove extract.      The only substantial omission from the United States offers is tin, (a Malayan interest) on which they have-up to the present refused to conventionalise the existing free entry.      As existing duties in the Colonies are almost exclusively revenue,  and not protective,  in character,  and as Customs duties are the most important source of revenue in nearly every Colony, it has not been possible as a general rule for the concessions offered by the Colonies in return to take the form of guaranteed maximum rates of duty on united States products.      Accordingly, the provisional offers have,  in general,  taken the form of reduction or conventionalisation (in a few cases abolition) of existing margins of preference and of the guarantee in some cases of continued equality of treatment with Empire goods.      The provisional offers are in respect of specified   goods    in specified   Colonies.      Care has been taken   to secure that, so far as possible, United Kingdom export trade will not be seriously affected,  although in one or two cases,  (notablsr the registration fees which are charged on foreign but not on British motor cars in Malas^a) , it will probably be found necessary to make concessions which may cause some replacement of United Kingdom goods by United States goods.
There are certain other features of the negotiations to which attention should bo drawn.as my colleagues will recall, Canada is the Dominion most closely affected by the provisional offers made to the United States on items involving Dominion consent to modification of preferences guaranteed under our trade agreements with the Dominions.     Negotiations between the United States and Canadian Governments for a trade agreement are proceeding in Washington simultaneously with our own;    and as a result of these negotiations Canada hopes to obtain concessions from the United States sufficient to enable her to justify the modification of certain of her preferences in the United Kingdom (of which the most important are apples and - if a solution can be found satisfactory to all parties concerned - lumber).    . In return, the Canadian Government were promised last year that we would be prepared to give sympathetic consideration to requests for modifications of guaranteed preferences enjoyed by the United Kingdom in Canada in order to facilitate the Canadian negotiations with the United States.    . After prolonged discussions both with united states representatives and with our Delegation, the Canadian Delegation have now submitted a list of such requests which they feel to be the minimum necessary to enable them to conclude a satisfactory Agreement with the United States and so to justify their consent to modifications of their preferences here.      In general,  it may be said that what we are being asked to give up in Canada is not disproportionate to what we have asked Canada to give up in the United Kingdom, and we are under an obligation to the Canadian Government to meet them so far as we reasonably can..     Moreover, although c abstain of the items involved, notably certain kinds of steel,  tinplate and galvanised sheets,  are likely to give rise to criticism from the
United Kingdom trades concerned, it is probable that the Canadian requests can substantially he met without serious damage to our export interests e      In the case of one item, however, anthracite, I am not at present prepared to agree to any concession, as it appears to me that this, would involve serious loss of trade in a market of vital importance to South Wales without the possibility of any compensatory advantages from the Agreement as a whole.General Provisions to be included   .in the Agreement.The drafting of the general clauses of the Agreement has proved peculiarly troublesome, but a settlement on most points of importance now appears to be In sight.The Agreement will include clauses in the usual terms providing for general most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of import and export duties and charges and in respect of prohibitions and restrictions, subject in the case of the latter to the usual exceptions for sanitary, health and similar regulations.      The United States have insisted on an exception from the prohibitions and restrictions clauses in order to cover their neutrality legislation and we have insisted in return on a provision giving freedom to both parties in the matter of prohibitions and restrictions in the event of either country being engaged in war.The U.S.A. have also insisted that they must reserve the right to impose duties in excess of those set out in the Schedules if the imposition of such duties becomes mandatory by reason of their anti-dumping legislation.     We are endeavouring to secure some measure of reciprocity by the inclusion of a provision giving us the right to impose duties on American good3 in similar circumstances, in excess of those guaranteed to them under the Agreement.      The U.S.A. are proving difficult on this point, but we hope to arrive   at a satisfactory compromise.
The U.S.A.  are anxious to include a provision wherehy the Agreement may he denounced by either party at short notice in the. event of a wide variation in &quot;ohe rate of exchange between the two countries.     We have tried to secure some definition of what is intended by &quot;wide variation&quot;, but the U.S.A. are anxious to leave this vague and not to include any definition in the text.The Agreement will also include a provision recognising our right to accord Imperial preference,  although in the case of mandated territories the United States Government are not prepared to recognise our right to give preference to Palestine.     As this is a right which has been recognised by only very few foreigncountries, our failure to secure it is not, perhaps, of practical importance.The United States have agreed, after considerable argument, to include all mandated territories,  including Palestine, within the scope of the general rnost-favoured-nation undertakings in the Agreement, which will also cover Newfoundland and the Colonial Empire.It is intended that the Agreement, as in the case of all Agreements concluded by the United States Government under the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act,  should be for an initial period of 3 years,  subject to the right of either country to denounce it on six months notice at the end of that period or at any time thereafter.O.P.G.S.Board of Trade,16th July,  1938,

It had now been decided that November elections did not impose a time
limit on our negotiations and impression was given that Americans intended to go pegging away indefinitely until they were met satisfactorily on their outstanding items.    They were not prepared to contemplate a minor agreement and agreement must he &quot;a considerable one or none at all&quot;.3.  Overton said with warmth that if Americans wanted impasse this was the one way of bringing it about.    In accordance with what they had urged throughout he had reported home major importance which they attached to some few agricultural items. Hawkins did not deny that this was a correct impression and in fact at one stage in the discussion he himself referred to the overriding importance of concessions for agriculture.    Overton said that our recent offer on industrial items represented just about the limit to which we could go and that therefore the main question outstanding was whether our position on one or two major agricultural items could be modified at all.    There was little more that could be done as he had repeatedly explained.    For example v:/e could not. in any case do anything on flour now in view of Australia&apos;s position.4. Hawkins replied, that Americans were far from accepting this position.    They felt very strongly that our offers taken as a whole were inadequate and involved, little direct sacrifice on the part of United Kingdom industry or agriculture and that they must press us until we were ready to make sacrifices corresponding to those which they were prepared to make.5.  Overton challenged this view and said that we should have to press Americans further on a number of items in Schedule 4. We had deliberately kept our demands within moderate limits. Time was coming when finality must be reached.    Delegation could, not stay indefinitely and once position on major agriculatural items
was cleared up we must conclude as quickly as possible. Hawkins, while not modifying his general position said that he would hold up despatch of telegram although it had been signed by Mr. Hull and would report discussion to Mr.Hull.7. While there may well be considerable elements of bluff in American attitude we think that they genuinely consider- our offers inadequate and will probably continue to press us to the utmost both on our offer as a whole and individually on a number of more important items.      Only way of meeting these tactics is to decide definitely how far we are prepared to go subject to agreement satisfactory as a whole and then to be absolutely firm even at the risk of a breakdown.      This is the line we propose to adopt as soon as we can define our position on outstanding agricultural items.     As regards motor cars position is somewhat changed by the fact that action can now be taken without legislation and we should be glad to have your confirmation that we are to stand firm.      It should be borne in mind that subject to consent of Canadians we are offering reductions in colonial preferences on motor cars from 20% to 15% in British Malay States and various other colonies.    (Canadians will probably consent to 15% margin but not less).     While tractors are of less importance our position is weaker than on motor cars since we cannot plead major political controversy.      It would help a great deal if we could offer suitable reduction on this item and we recommend that we be given authority to reduce to 25%.     As regards turpentine protective arguments do not apply   but political value to Americans would be substantial and if Americans press matters strongly we should be prepared to offer reduction to fourpence.    Are we to assume that we should refuse to go further-on typewriters  (on which Americans will press both on rate of
duty and on extension to portable machines) corsets,  silk stockings machine tools, hardwood, flooring iron and steel, etc.    All offers would of course be subject to our being met satisfactorily on Schedule 4.8. In view of decision on-tobacco we are not pursuing course suggested in our telegram Ho. 101.      Instead we propose to submit shortly our further demands on schedule 4 which are not very numerous the most important items being cottons and woollens. We feel, however,  that triere is little propsect of Americans going substantially further and that they may well retract some of their tentative offers.     In the absence of any concession on tobacco you will appreciate the importance of meeting them to the utmost extent possible on lard while we hope we may also be authorized to offer substantial increase in hams quota as soon as bacon negotiations are completed.     On canned beans we hope that we may be authorized to offer 15?S.9. Finally we think it necessary to insist on finalising the negotiations one way or the other as soon as we have given our replies on major agricultural items and offered any further adjustments possible on industrial items.     As our final position on apples, lumber and wheat is dependent on Canadian negotiation date of signature cannot be forecast at present.     These matters however would not require retention of full delegation at Washington and question may arise of part of Delegation returning home at the beginning of August retaining minimum skeleton here to see the thing through;.10,      Unless major difficulties arise Canadians hope to get main lines settled by early August and t o be ready to sign in about four weeks from now.

U.K.  - U.S.  NEGOTIATIONS - LARD. -Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade. My colleagues will appreciate,  from the summary of the present position of the American negotiations which I am circulating separately   T.A.C,   (36) 55J/,  that one of the-main outstanding points on which the United States are pressing us strongly for aN better offer is lard.      On this item Mr.  Overton has telegraphed from Washington as follows:-&quot;On lard I am convinced that a substantial reduction in duty would be of the greatest political value and is fully justified by American offers to us.      I strongly recommend that I be given authority to offer 3/- and,  if necessary,  to go to 2/6d per cwt.&quot;The Americans originally asked only for consolidation of the 10 per cent,  duty and a guarantee of no quantitative regulation of imports.      We agreed at once to the latter but not to the former, because the Agricultural Departments were afraid of a repetition of the levels of imports and prices which occurred in 1933 and 1934.      As? however,  current prices were abnormally high owing to the North American drought it was eventually agreed to offer a specific duty of 5/- per cwt. (equivalent to a little less than 10 per cent,  ad valorem at the prices ruling in the first part of 1937).This figure was included in our offer of November 5th and owing to a subsequent fall in prices, we have since offered 4/6d.After our Delegation arrived at Washington,  the Americans changed their request and asked for free entry.      They are now pressing very strongly for a substantial reduction.-1-
The Delegation will naturally make as much as possible of our offer to guarantee freedom from quantitative regulation for lard, particularly as I gather it has lately been rather overlooked.      But,  however much we make of it,  it remains a rather negative benefit compared with a reduction of duty. Moreover,  i fear the Americans will not attach very much value to the argument that 4/- is a reduction of duty so long as prices are at the level of the last three years since, as everyone knows,  these years have been years of abnormal shortage and consequent high prices owing to the American drought.      I understand that the Americans expect their hog population to return to normal about the end of this year and we must expect that their trade-in lard will then also return to normal.      On prices obtaining in the two years (1033 and 1934) before the drought,  the 4/- duty involves not a decrease of duty but an actual increase and we cannot expect the Americans to welcome this as a result of the Trade Agreement.Further,  so far as regards our bacon industry,  I understand that 1/- per cwt.  in the price of lard is roughly equivalent to only Id.  on the price of a pig and,  since the maximum reduction for which the Delegation ask authority is 2/-per cwt. below the figure already offered, and l/6d. per cwt. below the figure to which the Minister of Agriculture is prepared to go, the effect of the concession on pig prices could not be very great.The position is, however,  that so far as any practical effect is concerned we are left with a concession which,  on the one hand,  the Americans desire largely for political purposes (there is very little sign in the import figures that the duty has at any time had,  or is likely to have in the future, any practical effect on the quantity of lard imported) and on the other,  a concession which would be of no practical disadvantage to us, but which is difficult for political reasons.
Board of Trade, 15th July,  1938.Mr Overtoil&apos;s view, with which, after examining the American offers,  I am in agreement is that we can sell this concession at a good price which should he reflected in solid advantages to our textile industries among others.      I am strongly of opinion therefore that we should he prepared,  if necessary,  to agree to the reductions he proposes.I attach a table showing imports from the II. 3. A.  in the years 1920 to 1937,  the declared value, and the ad valorem incidence of duties of 4/-,  3/- and 2/6d.O.F.G.S.

(56) 54CAJ3JNETCOMMITTEE ON TRADE AND AGRICULTURE U.K.   - U.S.  NEGOTIATIONS - LARDMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries. The president of the Board of Trade in his memorandumof 15th July with regard to the question of lard in the U.K. - U.S. negotiations (T.A.C.   (36) 52) urges that a substantial reduction in the import duty on lard is desirable in order to secure certain advantages to our textile industry, among others.      The President suggests that such a concession would be fully justified by American offers to us and that since it would have considerable political value in the United States it would generally facilitate an agreement. 2. It is probably true that the concession proposed would be of some political value to the United States, although it is difficult to believe that its importance can be so great as the telegram from the U.K. delegation suggests, since no request for anything more than conventionalisation of the existing duty of 10 per cent, was put forward by the United States until some time after the Delegation had arrived in Washington, and indeed, until after preliminary discussions had taken place on agricultural and industrial items in the American &quot;long list&quot;.3. How far a substantial reduction in this duty can bejustified by the American offers to us is, I feel, a matter on which it is necessary to have regard to the whole balance of the Agreement and to the relative political difficulties that would be caused by concessions on the various items.      It can hardly be the case that the only course possible is to select one item out of those upon which the United States
9 (\ e &amp; y 0are now pressing us and to offer a substantial concession on that one item alone.4. The proposal to offer a substantial reduction inthe duty on lard should, I suggest, be considered both from the American and from our own point of view.    From the American standpoint the existing duty on lard is already low, being merely the general 10 per cent, ad valorem rate and my offer to agree to the substitution of a specific rate of 4s. Od. per cwt.  represents a material reduction in the incidence of the duty at the average prices ruling in each of the past eighteen years with the exception of the three years 1932 to 1934 when prices were forced down to abnormally low levels. A reduction of the duty to a level at which it can be represented as equivalent toN7-g per cent, or less in fourteen of the past eighteen years is itself an offer of considerable political importance.    Of even greater value to a country such as the United States whose surplus for export varies very widely is the additional undertaking that there should be no quantitative regulation of imports.5. From our point of view further concessions on this item would give rise to serious difficulties.    The marginallowed to the bacon curer under the Bacon Industry Bill is fixed at a figure which will be unremunerative to a considerablenumber of curers.    Moreover, the margin will be subject tosuccessive reductions in the second and third years, when theAmerican pig population has recovered from the heavy reductions in recent years and largely increased supplies of lard in theUnited States are expected to he available.    The curer&apos;s margindepends to a large extent upon the price he receives for offals,of which lard is the most important.    This margin hasalready been reduced as a result of&apos; the serious    declinein the average value of lard, which has fallen by 18s. Od.per cwt.  during the last twelve months.       Producers and2.
curers will certainly attribute any furtner fall in prices (which is by no means unlikely)  to  the reduction in the duty, especially if it is of the order of that now suggested.      The curers are already very much concerned about tne effect on their margin of the substantial fall in the price of lard and only a few weeks ago a deputation from the Bacon Marketing-Board urged that quantitative regulation of imports of lard should be introduced;    this was resisted,      An announcement of a drastic reduction in the duty on lard in the U.S. Agreement shortly after the Bacon Industry Bill becomes law, would be very likely in my view to give rise to considerable political embarrassment and might be regarded as a breach of faith on the part of the Government towards the bacon curing industry. 6. Before a decision is reached on the question of lardit is, I think, desirable to direct attention to certain aspects of the general position of these negotiations as disclosed in the President&apos;s other memorandum (ToAoC.  (36)  53).      Our offers to the U. S,   cover reductions of duty in respect of imports valued in 1936 at  10 millions, of which agricultural items amount bo over  5 millions.      Agriculture is, therefore, bearing the bi jden of a large part of the duty concessions that we have offered.      Moreover, as the President points oi.it, the figure for wneat is not by any means representative of the normal volume of the U.S.   trade in this product.      In the first six months of 1938 alone, imports of wheat from the U.S.  were valued at  5.4 millions. The wheat trace operates on small margins and the removal of the duty of 3s,Od.  per quarter on the basis of normal American harvests and of the figures of trade before the duty was imposed, should alone increase U,S0  shipments by some
 8 millions per annum.      There is nothing as far as I can see in the American offers to us that is comparable in its political effect with our offer of free entry for wheat. 7. On the other hand, practically the whole of theUnited States concessions to us relate to industrial goods and in my judgment there will be very unfortunate political reactions in the rural constituencies, especially having regard to the present state of agricultural opinion as to the Government&apos;s agricultural policy in general,  if concessions on agricultural products are pushed beyond the point that can be reasonably defended.8, It must be remembered also that the gains theUnited States will secure in our colonial territories are much greater than the colonies are likely to secure in the United States,  since most of the United States concessicns relate only to the consolidation of free entry for products which the United States does not herself produce.9, If, upon consideration,    my colleagues are satisfiedthat it is necessary to offer something more to the United States in order to effect a balance in the Agreement, there are in my view other items in the American list of desiderata which would be of equal or even great political significance, and which might be considered as alternatives to a concession on lard. The United Kingdom delegation    in recent telegramshave emphasized the importance attached by the United Stabes to concessions on soft woods and tobacco.      A concession on either of these would not adversely affect our own producers. There are certain manufactured goods also upon which the United States are pressing hard for concessions,  to which it has not hitherto been found possible to accede.    I may instance motor cars,
2oetrack laying tractors, typewriters and. turpentine.      On motor cars, of which the imports from the United Stated were valued in 1956 at about  1,350,000, the most we have offered is binding of the existing duty of 33-3- per cent,  on cars of over 30 tup.      On track-laying tractors, which are of material interest to the United Kingdom farmer, we have also offered only binding of duty of 33-g per cent.      Our attitude on this item will undoubtedly be contrasted by the agricultural industry with the reductions in duty on agricultural products. On typewriters, imports of which from the United States were worth  600,000 in 1936, we have offered only a duty of  3.1s.0d.  on machines of over  6.0s.0d.  in value and 22 lbs.  in weight.      On turpentine we have not been able to make any offer.10. I appreciate the difficulty, to which the presidentrefers, of offering any greater concessions on these industrial products, and also on timber and tobacco, but the -political embarrassment that will arise from a substantial reduction in the duty on lard, combined with the pledge that there shall be no quantitative regulation of lard under the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1935, will, I think, be quite as great as the difficulty that would arise from a concession on any of these other items.      It is not as if lard were the only pig product on which we are offering concessions.      Substantial advantages should also accrue to United States producers from our offers in respect of hams and frozen and chilled pork.      The reductions in duties, and other concessions that we are proposing to make, on fruit, hams and honey in order to secure advantages for United Kingdom manufacturers will be difficult enough to defend in the rural areas.      Agricultural resentment would be greatly increased if a substantial reduction in the duty on lard were also to be offered.W. S.M.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 19th July, 1938. 5.
