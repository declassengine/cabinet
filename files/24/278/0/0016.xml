CONFIDENTIAL. A.C.     4BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL. STATS OF TRAPS - JUNE.  1958. Summary of reports submitted &quot;by Members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.    Imports in June at  76.5 million were  11.7 million less than in June, 1937;    imports of food, drink and tobacco were  2.6 million more, and raw materials and articles mainly unmanufactured were  8.0 million less.     Exports of United Kingdom products,  36.9 million were  7.5 million less than a year ago.EMPLOYMENT.    Employment showed a further decline in June. It is. provisionally estimated that at the 13th June, the number of insured persons aged 16 - 64 in employment in Great Britain, exclusive of the persons within the Agricultural Scheme, was approximately 11,333,000.      This was 42,000 less than at 16th May, 1938, and. on a comparable basis, about 326,000 less than at the 21st June, 1937.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.    In the 4 weeks ended 26th June railway traffic receipts decreased by  568,000 (4.39%) as compared with the corresponding period of 1937.     The comparisons are affected by the incidence of the Whitsun Holidays.     As from the 1st October last charges were increased by 5%, except surburban passenger fares within the London Passenger Transport Area.SHIPPING.    Freight markets remained quiet, and the Chamber of Shipping index number, which increased slightly in May, fell to 123.1 in June  (1935 = 100), the lowest point since September, 1936.SHIPBUILDING.    The placing of orders continued to be disappointing, and the prospects are not encouraging.    Tonnage commenced in the past quarter was less than in the previous quarter and less than half the quantity for the corresponding period in 1937.
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD.Belgium. The belga recovered in -June to 29.23.    The volume of Belgian exports of gold to this country was a reflection of the heavy strain-on the Exchange in May.. Fraiice. Operations on the Bourse in June, though still restricted, were more satisfactory than in recent months.    The franc moved within narrow limits.Holland. Funds continued abundant on the Amsterdam market and security and commodity prices- improved under the influence of Wall Street.&apos;   The guilder was again strong.U.S.A.  Depressed conditions on the Stock Exchange continued until the 20th June when the trend of business was reversed and prices rose steadily to  the end of the month.    The dollar was firm at the beginning of the month, falling on the 15th June to 4.97jg but recovering later owing to control buying. BANKING. The Defence Loan was successfully issued in June. Provincial clearings continued to  reflect the lower level of activity, particularly in Lancashire,  although Newcastle showed an improvement over the year before.COAL. The falling off in production and supply was accentuated in recent weeks with no prospect of an early recovery.    In the inland trade the seasonal contraction in demand for domestic coal was accompanied by a lower industrial demand. Export trade suffered from a decline in industrial activity in Europe and elsewhere,  exports in June being valued at  3.1 million as compared with  3.3 million a year before. IRON AND STEEL.  As a result of the usual  slackness and of the general recession in trade,  activity in the iron and steel industry in June was not maintained at the high level of recent months.    Heavy steelmakers were well occupied on existing contracts,  although new business was rather   slow  in coming forward.
ENGINEERING.      The slackening of activity continued during June and the volume of new orders hooked showed a further decline.      Exports of machinery were valued at  4.8 million in comparison with  4.2 million in the previous year. Imports ( 1.7 million) were. 591,000 less.NON-FERROUS METALS.      There was a marked recovery in prices during the second half of June, owing to the improvement on Wall Street.      Consumers in &quot;this country increased their purchases to a moderate extent.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.      The generation of electricity in June increased by 2.4- per cent over that of a year before. Activity in tne industry was maintained.      Exports of electrical machinery,  653,000,  showed an increase of 41.1 per cent as compared with June, 1937,      Imports,  42,000, declined by 6.6 per cent.COTTON.      Activity remained at a very low level in June. There was, however, a revival   in the volume of new buying, mainly as a result of the recovery in raw cotton prices,  and for a few weeks production should be maintained.      Exports of piece goods were 96.1 million square yards in June as compared with 154.8 million sq. yds.  in June of 1937. WOOL.      Production in June remained at a low level.    Exports of tops,  yarns and tissues all declined as compared with a year ago.HOSIERY.      Business showed no sign of improvement. TIMBER.      There was an increase in the number of small contracts for immediate requirements of softwoods, but there were few large purchases.      Consumption in the country as a whole remained satisfactory.      Conditions in the American Lumber Market were more lively owing to the change in business sentiment in the United States.
CHEMICALS.      Both home and export trade in heavy chemicals declined and deliveries of Chlorine products were less than in the previous month or in June,  1937.      Home and foreign sales of dyestuffs were considerably below those of the year before, but trade in fertilisers was maintained.POTTERY.       Unemployment in   April rose further,  and exports of general earthenware declined as compared with the previous year.     The home market in china continued slack, but tile factories were fairly busy.LEATHER.        Trade was quiet in most sections of the leather industry over the last three months.      Prices of raw hides, calf skins and goat skins touched the lowest point for several years, mainly owing to the withdrawal of United States tanners from the market.      Recently there have been signs of a renewal of buying in the U.S.A.RETAIL TRADE:    The money value of total retail sales in May was 6.1 per cent,  lower than in May,  1937.      Sales of food and perishables declined by 3.9 per cent;    sales of non-food merchandise declined by 8.3 per cent.      The comparisons are affected to some extent by the incidence of the Whitsun holidays and of the Coronation last year.      Preliminary returns for June show satisfactory increases in daily sales in most areas, except in central London.CO-OPERATIVE TRADE (Scotlanql.       There was no improvement in the drapery section during the past quarter, owing to the uncertainty of the market and adverse weather conditions. Trade in the furnishing department was normal for the time of the year and factories were fully employed.
CANADIAN TRADE.-      Business operations in May declined as compared with the preceding month.      The index of the physical volume of business dropped slightly, but many of the individual factors    (chiefly those relating to the manufacture of foodstuffs and tobacco) reached a high position in relation to the same month of the post war years.      Common stock prices averaged rather higher than in April.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.      Wool production for 1938-39 is estimated at 6 per cent,  less than in 1937-38.      Imports of merchandise in May amounted to  12.0 million (Australian currency) compared with  8.5 million last year.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.      Imports in May were 13. 0% lower than a year before.      Exports other than gold were 34.3% less, the decline being mainly in diamonds, wool, hides and skins, and copper.      There were increases in wattle bark and extract, fruit end coal.COLONIAL TRADE:      Both prices and volume of consumption of most Colonial products have declined considerably during the past year, thus reducing the purchasing power of the Colonial Empire.
