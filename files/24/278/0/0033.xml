CAB  I N E T.Plans for Increasing the Production of Food in the United Kingdom.I, i.  - -.- i.......  - .......Stf___-____Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries the Secretary of State for Scotland and, the Secretary of State for the Home Department.1. We seek the approval of our colleagues to the putting into operation,  in the event of the present emergency developing into an outbreak of war, of plans that have been prepared by the agricultural departments for increasing the home production of food.    An outline of these plans,  including a description, of the central and local organisation   to be set up, was given in an Interim Report (C.I.D. Paper 1276-3) of . the Food Supply Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence,  which was approved by that Commit teej  and the quantitative estimate of increased, production referred to in paragraph 3 of this memorandum was approved by the Food Supply Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence (C.I.D. Paper F.S.  21).    The immediate steps to be taken on the outbreak of war were agreed,  in principle,  at a meeting of Ministers held on Monday,  26th September,  at 3.0 p.m. (Conclusion X).    It is, however,  important that the several plans should receive early approval so that they may be put into operation as soon as possible in the present ploughing season.2. A net increase in the home production of food canonly be brought about by increasing the area under arable cultivation.    Accordingly, our plans have as their basis the ploughing up of grassland and its conversion into arable land.    In order to secure the maximum food value from the resulting arable acreage it is desirable that as much as &apos; possible should be sown with wheat and other cereals and
potatoes.      The importance of an adequate supply of livestock products,  especially fresh milk and. othei  fats, must not he overlooked., however,  and in view of the large quantity of animal feeding stuffs at present imported, it will he necessary, to secure a greater production of animal feedingstuffs   in this country.     We therefore propose that farmers who keep livestock should he advised to make every effort to grow as much as possible of their own requirements of feedingstuffs. 3. On the assumption that adequate supplies of labourand of implements and. other requisites will be available we estimate that it would be possible to increase the present arable area in the &quot;United Kingdom by 1,325,000&quot;*&quot; acreas for the 1939 harvest, of which 250,000 acres would be ploughed for autumn sowing and the remainder for spring sowing.      This area should produce approximately 429,000 tons of wheat,  60,000 tons of barley,  374,000 tons of oats and 1,780,000 tons of potatoes.      These figures represent increases of 28%, 9%, 20% and 36%   respectively on the production in 1937. 4. These increases in production can only be broughtabout by securing the goodwill and co-operation of farmers and while it will, of course, be necessary to have powers to ensure that all farmers cultivate their land to the best advantage and. produce the maximum quantity of food,  it is in our view of the utmost importance that farmers should be given an assurance that they will be provided with a secure market and remunerative prices for their produce.      This is primarily the responsibility of the Board of Trade with which our Departments have been in consultation.5. Steps are being taken to enable the agricultural departments to be organised on a war footing immediately on the outbreak of war.      We do not recommend, however, that a separate2,A small part of this acreage in Northern Ireland would be devoted to the production of flax.
t) ei UPocd production Department should he set up as in the last war. 6. Under the Defence Regulations that will he madeas soon as the Defence (Emergency powers) Bill has been passed, we shall he empowered to control the manner in which agricultural land is to &quot;tee cultivated.      In England and Wales it is proposed that the powers shall &quot;tee delegated to War Agricultural Executive Committees to he constituted for each county.      These Committees, like the similar committees that were set up towards the end of the last war, will thus &quot;be empowered to direct farmers to plough up grassland and to sow it with whatever arable crop ceems most suitable.      The Committees will include representatives of all classes of the agricultural community - landowners,  tenants and workers. They will act with full knowledge of local c conditions and will receive assistance and technical advice from officers of the Ministry of Agriculture and the various research centres, from the agricultural staffs of local authorities, and from local land agents,  surveyors, etc      With the approval of the Pood Supply Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, the Chairmen of these Committees have already been selected and steps have &quot;been taken to select two or three members of each Committee and &quot;key&quot; officers.      The Minister of Agriculture asks for approval to appoint these Committees without delay if war breaks out.      Similar Committees to which a measure of delegation (but not compulsory powers) willb e given willb e required in Scotland..    The Chairmen and certain &quot;key&quot; officers of these Committees have been selected and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland desires authority to complete the Committees forthwith.7. In order to carry out the programme of increased production outlined in paragraph 3, it will be necessary to retain on the land as many as possible of the present rapidly declining number of agricultural workers and to provide and
3 ci&apos; &amp;train substitutes for those taken for service with the armed forces and to augment the present inadequate supply of labour. The arrangements with regard to the withdrawal of agricultural workers for the forces have been discussed with and settled &quot;by the Man Power Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.      In order to provide substitute and additional workers,  arrangements will be made to give a short course of specialised training in agricultural practice at the various agricultural colleges and other institutions to persons willing to work whole time on the land and for farmers to train the additional labour required.      It is also proposed to establish a Women&apos;s Land Army on the same lines as in the last war, and the Minister of Agriculture has secured the services of Lady   Denman as Director.      In this case also it is desired that the Minister should be empowered to arrange for the appointment of Women1s County Committees. B. , Arrangements are being made in consultation with otherDepartments to facilitate the supply and distribution of farmers&apos; requisites including seeds, fertilisers, machinery, oil, feedingstuffs and hinder twine.      It will also &quot;be necessary to secure that the available tractsrs, horses and Implements are used to their fullest capacity.      There is a shortage of such requisites in certain parts of the country where arable farming has not &quot;been practised to any great extent in recent years;    and in other parts of the country there is believed to be a potential surplus. t   Accordingly, the power to &quot;be conferred by the Defence Regulations to enable such articles to be requisitioned will &quot;be exercised if necessary so that they may be transferred, under the super-visien of the County Executive Committees, from areas where there is a surplus to deficient areas.      Compensation would be payable where loss was suffered in accordance with the provisions of the War Compensation Bill.
9 O o*J c3* 59. The compulsory pcwers referred, tw in thepreceding paragraphs will not &quot;toe available until the defence regulations have been made and the local organisation will not be in a position to exercise those powers for several weeks after the outbreak of war.      It is, however, important thatan authoritative statement of the Government&apos;s proposals withregard to increased food production should &quot;be made at theearliest possible moment in order that farmers may know whatis expected of them, that the full support and oo-operation of farmers&apos; organisations may be secured, and that the general public may be assured that this aspect of war organisation isreceiving immediate attention.      The need for such anannouncement is of special urgency at the present time, sincethe ploughing up of pastures should begin at once if themaximum arable area is to be secured in time for next year&apos;sharvest.      At a meeting of Ministers held on Monday,26th September,  it was agreed (Conclusion X):-(1) That the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,in consultation with the Board of Trade and the Scottish Office, should consult with the Treasury regarding the financial implications of an appeal, aeeompanied by monetary inducements,  to &quot;be made to farmers immediately on the outbreak of war to plough an extra 10)6 of their land for wheat.(2) That, subject to the concurrence of the treasury in this proposal,  the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries should be authorised to make this appeal on the outbreak of war.We have been in consultation wjth the Board of Trade and theTreasury and it has been agreed that the appeal to farmers should be on the lines set out in the Appendix to thismemorandum.      It will be observed that in order to encouragefarmers to made an immediate start with their ploughing, we propose to offer to make a payment of  1 per acre to allfarmers in England and Wales who plough up before31st December land returned as permanent pasture in their1938 June R.eturns, and who increase their acreage undercereals or potatoes by an area equivalent to that of the
permanent pasture ploughed up,      A similar payment will be made to farmers in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but a slightly later date will be fixed since winter ploughing operations continue later in those countries than in England and Wales,      We also propose to announce that a minimum price of 11/- per cw.t,  (49/6d. per quarter) will &quot;fee paid for all wheat of millable quality harvested in 1.939,      These proposals have been agreed to by the Treasury and we recommend them to our colleagues as a simple and effective means of inaugurating the campaign for increased food production for which we ask for approval in this memorandum. Summary.10. We accordingly ask the Cabinet&apos;s approval of our plans generally, and in particular of the following proposals (i)    That in the tfvent of war a policy of increasing the arable area by ploughing up grassland should be adopted.(ii)    That the estimates of increased production given in paragraph 3 of this memorandum should be accepted.(iii)    That the Committees referred to in paragraph of this memorandum should be set up on the outbreak: of wart(iv)    That the powers to &quot;be given &quot;by the defence regulations for controlling the cultivation of agricultural land should be delegated to County Executive Committees in England and Wales, (v)    That Ministers should take such steps as they think necessary to establish Women&apos;s County Committees and a Women5s Land Army.(vi)    That powers to requisition tractors,, implements and horses should be exercised if necessary, (vii)    That immediately on the outbreak of war an appeal
te farmers en the lines of the Appendix (which has. been agreed inter-Departmentally) should he issued, and in particular(a) that farmers should be urged te plough up 10% ef their grassland;(b) that a payment equivalent te,  1 per acre ef grassland ploughed up shculd &amp;e made te farmers who plough up grassland hefore 51st December, 1938, in England and Wales (and dates to be determined later in the ease ef Scotland and Northern Ireland) and who increase their acreage under cereals or potatoes by an equivalent area;    and(c) that a minimum price of 11/- per cwta (49/6do per quarter) should be offered for wheat of the 1939 harvest.Wo So ill .J.G.&quot;27th September, 193B.
APPENDIX. Notice to Farmers0At this time of grave national emergency, His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to inform farmers how they can best co-operate with them in their urgent task of organising all the resources of the country to meet a common danger.Farmers have an important part to play in the defence of the country     Supplies of foodstuffs in the country are sufficient for present needs;    hut in order to relieve as much as possible the heavy burdens on our merchant shipping we must start at once to grow more food from our own soil.    The best way ef doing this is to plough up grassland and to sow at once more cereal crops,  and, in the spring, more potatoes also.    The Government have worked out plans for securing that the necessary area of grassland will be ploughed up and that this task will be distributed fairly amongst individual farms and farmers.    Steps are also being taken to arrange to ensure the necessary supplies of labour, machinery, oil, fertilisers, feedingstuffs, seeds,  etc.    In England and Wales Executive Committees of local personswill have power to enforce any ord.ers that they make in pursuance of the Governments ploughing-up programme, but the Government are confident that they can rely on farmers to carry out loyally any instructions that may be given by the Committees.This organisation will be set up as soon as the necessary Parliamentary powers have been secured.    Meanwhile there is no time to be lost if the maximum arable acreage is tc be obtained for next year1 s harvest.    The Government therefore urges all those farmers who have the necessary implements or can obtain them to plough up immediately at least 10% of their present grassland and either&apos; on such land or cn existing arable land to plant additional wheat, where
that is possible, or to make preparations for the spring sowing of other cereals or potatoes0    In order to assist farmers to make an immediate start with ploughing, the Government undertake to make a payment of  1 per acre in respect of all land that was retxirned as permanent pasture in the 1938 June Returns and is ploughed up before 31st December, 1938, on condition that the acreage under cereals or potatoes on tne form concerned is increased by an area equivalent to that of the permanent pasture ploughed up.    The Government will buy all millable wheat produced in the 1939 harvest and will pay a minimum price of 11/- per cwt, (49/6d0 per quarter)0Farmers who depend on purchased feedingstuffs for -their livestock are advised that there is at present no shortage of feedingstuffs and they should not take any precipitate steps such as the indiscriminate slaughtering of their stoci.    The country must nave sufficient supplies of livestock products,  especially fresh milK,  and the Government will control the supplies and distribution of feedingstuffs so that the necessary stoci-c can be maintained.    At the same time, farmers with livestock are strongly urged to make every effort to grow on their own farms as much as possible of the feedingstuffs that they will require in case supplies from overseas have to be reduced.    Any farmer who has- a surplus of oats and feeding barley will be assured by the Government of a market for these cereals of the 1939 harvest at prices which will be fixed in June next in the light of conditions then existing.    Halting barley will be purchased at prices to be determined later according to grade and will be paid for at the rate appropriate to the grade, whetner or not such barley is eventually used for malting,
Farmers desiring advice as to the &quot;best methods of cultivating newly-plougned grassland or on any otner matter in connection with the food production campaign should apply to tneir County Agricultural Organiser or to their County Branch of the National Farmers&apos;  Union,The Government are confident tnat they will have the fullest support and co-operation of farmers in their efforts to increase the production of food from our own soil.3n
