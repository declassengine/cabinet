[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1938SECRETCP. 180 (38) Copy No... .CABINETTHE  INDIAN  federation the Negotiations with the Indian States as to the Terms oftheir AccessionMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR indian rny discussions with Lord Linlithgow, since his return from India on leave, he has impressed upon me with the utmost emphasis the importance which he attaches to the early initiation of steps to secure the accession to Federation of the requisite number and proportion of the Indian States, in order that the Government may be in a position to invite Parliament to proceed with the measures prescribed by the Act for the inauguration of Federation. Whatever opposition to Federation may be brought to bear from British India, Lord Linlithgow considers that further delay in approaching the States will merely facilitate the development of the organised opposition to Federation.now in progress, and that there is no immediate prospect of opinion among the Princes becoming more favourable to accession than it is at present.2. As a result of our discussions I share Lord Linlithgow&apos;s view that it is desirable to communicate to the Princes as soon as possible the conclusions we have reached as regards the terms subject to which His Majesty would be advised to accept their accession to Federation.3. From the start of the discussions -which preceded the framing of the Act it has been recognised that, at the outset at all events, there must be some differentiation between the States on the one hand and the Provinces on the other, and indeed to some extent between State and State. The problem has been to determine the permissible extent of such differentiation having regard to the claims of the States, the dictates of fairness to the Provinces and the interests of India as a whole. Some indication of the terms which would be regarded as satisfactory, from the point of view of ensuring that the contribution of the States to Federation was adequate, was given in the report of the Joint Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform, more particularly with reference to finance in paragraphs 263-5; and the problem engaged much attention in Parliament during the Debates on the Bill Section 6 of the Act of 1935 provides for the execution by acceding Rulers of Instruments declaring, in relation to those matters for which they accede, their acceptance of the provisions of the Act as operative in their States, and their assumption of the obligation of ensuring that due effect is given in their States to these provisions. But the Act (section 6 (2)) also enables any Ruler in specifying the matters which are for his State to be controlled by the executive and legislative powers of the Federation to specify the limitations to which the exercise of those powers is to be subject. Accordingly, the range aud extent of federal powers in relation to any given Federated State is determined by the Act as interpreted in the light of that State&apos;s Instrument of Accession. Lord Linlithgow, after his arrival in India, lost no time in deputing officers to explain to the States the provisions of the Act relevant to their accession and to invite the Rulers to specify the conditions on which they were willing to accede. The replies of the Rulers, which raised many complicated issues, have since been under close examination in India and at the India Office. As a result of this examination conclusions have been reached in regard to the limitations subject to which accession for the matters specified in the Federal Legislative List in Schedule VII of the Government of India Act could be permitted. The form of Instrument of Accession which I propose for adoption, subject to final drafting changes, is appended as Annexure I to this Note. In Annexure II are set 7368 A
out the relevant entries in the Federal Legislative List showing the matters for which the States will be required to accede either unconditionally or subject to limitations.4. Although the sum total of the limitations which the States have demanded is very large, it has been found possible, as indicated in Annexure II, to set aside the great majority of these, as being either unnecessary or inadmissible. The compara-tively few limitations which it is proposed to allow are required in order either to avoid obscurity or to safeguard arrangements to which States, either on account of their general position as contrasted with the Provinces or owing to existing rights, have established a claim good enough to warrant some variation from a uniformity of treatment of all units of the Federation. In the majority of instances the type of limitation which it is proposed to allow is not such as would seriously affect the content of a Ruler&apos;s accession for the matter in question. For instance, the only limitation which it is proposed to allow in respect of Entry 1 (Defence Forces) in Annexure II is that no Federal Law can introduce compulsory military service in the State, and in the case of Entry 42 (Offences against Federal laws) that accession is limited to offences against laws which the Federal Legislature is competent to enact for the State in question. A few of the entries, however, raise questions of some difficulty, notabh/ those relating to Customs and Excise, and I think it right that my proposals in regard to these entries should be known to and approved by my colleagues in advance.   To these I will return in a later paragraph.5. Since the replies of the States to the Viceroy&apos;s enquiries were received in 1937, there has been no further discussion with them as regards accession to Federation. The Viceroy has recommended that the method of approach in the light of our conclusions should be on the following lines. In the first instance the terms of the Instrument of Accession which it is proposed to adopt and an indication of the limitations which would be allowed would be communicated orally to certain selected States of major importance. While the representatives of these States would be given clearly to understand that there was no prospect of any but unimportant modifications in the terms disclosed, this preliminary approach is considered desirable, for tactical reasons, in order to satisfy the amour-propre of the Rulers whose decision in favour of accession must greatly influence other States, and also to forestall complaints of having been taken by surprise when the terms of the offer are later communicated formally and in detail to all States. After these informal contacts, all States eligible for accession would be informed through political officers of the details of the offer. It would be explained that these represented the maximum which could be considered, and a time-limit would be laid down within which the States would be asked to indicate definitely their willingness or otherwise to federate on these terms. The method of approach outlined above appears to me to be the best fitted to the circumstances of the case, and I agree with Lord Linlithgow that no time should now be lost in its initiation.6. I now turn to the particular matters of difficulty in relation to the terms of the offer in regard to which I consider it essential to have the approval of my colleagues. In paragraph 265 of the Report of the Joint Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform attention was drawn to the rights enjoyed by Maritime States in respect of Customs. Broadly speaking, the position in these States is that sea customs are at present collected under the authority of the Kuler though at the same rates as in British India, and that the proceeds are retained by the State ; but^under Agreements which in their latest form were negotiated in 1936, any goods which have been charged with customs duty on import at a State port would be subject to further duty on entry into British India imless accompanied by a certificate showing that duty has been levied. Goods accompanied by such certificates are admitted into British India duty free, but the States which have levied duty are required to refund to the Government of India the duty on goods entering British India when this exceeds certain specified annual totals (in the case of Nawanagar Rs. 5 lakhs and in the case of certain other States Rs. 2 lakhs). These Agreements also provide that the State shall see that&quot; no improper inducements are offered to shippers and others with a view to stimulating trade at the State ports as compared with ports of British India, and that the Paramount Power has a right to satisfy itself that these conditions are observed.In other words, apart from the fact that in these States customs duties are collected by an agency appointed and controlled by the State, and not as in British
India by a staff employed by the Central Government, the effect of these arrange-ments is to differentiate a Maritime State from a Maritime Province in that the former retains as State revenues an appreciable proportion of the dues collected, whereas customs duties collected in British India accrue exclusively to the Central. Exchequer and the Provinces receive no part of them.7. The Joint Parliamentary Committee considered that the amount of duty which a State should be permitted to retain on goods imported through its ports ought not to exceed the amount of the duty attributable to goods actually consumed in the territory of the State. Only, however, in the case of Baroda has it so far been possible to negotiate an Agreement on these lines. Lord Linlithgow is convinced that none of the Maritime States would be willing to accede for the customs entries except subject to the limitation that they remain entitled to carry on with the administration of customs in the terms, of their present Agreements, and to retain the same proportion of customs duties as at present. After full consideration, it appears to me that it would be improper to allow accession for sea customs on such terms. If a State were permitted to accede for customs subject to a limitation which would ensure this result, the Federation would be permanently disabled from altering the position in any respect otherwise than with the consent of the State. I propose, therefore, in agreement with Lord Linlithgow, to inform the Viceroy that in the case of the Maritime States accession for the entries relating to sea customs (Entries 19 and 44 of Annexure II) should not be allowed on the terms which the States are demanding, and that the present Agreements should continue and should be enforced after inspection, if need be by sanctions imposed by the Paramount Power. I consider that in this way the States concerned would in substance, though not in form, lie participating no less in the Indian customs system and not less effectively than if they were to accede subject to a limitation which in effect left their acceptance of these entries without significance If this position is allowed to continue, there is a better chance of their accession for sea customs at a later date on terms such as the Joint Parliamentary Committee would have approved.8. Somewhat similar considerations apply in relation to Federal Excises (Entry 45 of Annexure II) In this case in the spring of 1934 the Government of India had found it necessary for financial reasons to impose for the first time excise duties on matches and sugar ; and in order to prevent the States who were in a position to manufacture these commodities from flooding British India with untaxed or lightly taxed products in the absence of effective customs barriers, it made Agreements with them, terminable at short notice. These Agreements provided that the States should, in the case of matches, impose excise duty at the British India rate on matches manufactured in the States, that all proceeds of match excise in British India and the States should be paid into a common pool and that the pool should be divided between the Government of India and the States concerned on a consumption basis estimated by reference to population; and in the case of sugar that each manufacturing State should impose an excise duty at the British India rate on sugar manufactured in the State and should itself retain the proceeds. The Viceroy is emphatic that no State which has benefited under these Agreements will be willing to accede for Federal excise except subject to a limitation which would ensure to the States as a maximum the amount which they got in the year 1936-37. I am in agreement with Lord Linlithgow that the accession of the States in question for Federal Excises should be subject to limitations which would secure for them this position. There is provision in the Government of India Act that, if an Act of the Federal Legislature so provides, the whole or part of the net proceeds of an excise duty may be distributed to the Provinces and to the Federated States, and the Government of India feel confident that the advantage which, for the moment, the limitation now in question gives to the States will eventually, and probably soon, be absorbed in the general distribution of excise revenue.9. I should add that there are some other entries of a fiscal character, such as Salt, for which the States will not be required to accede. I do not propose to trouble my colleagues with the details of these. But here again Lord Linlithgow has convinced me that any effort to insist on accession for these matters on terms which would involve the States renouncing any of their existing privileges would be infructnous.
10. It should be borne in mind that the Governor-General has a special responsibility &quot;for the protection of the rights of any Indian State,&quot; in virtue of which he has the power, if necessary, to overrule proposals of his Ministry, and which is necessarily a factor of importance in his decision whether or not to grant his assent to any Federal Act. This responsibility extends to any rights which a State has not expressly renounced on accession for a Federal matter. In the case of rights which States have been allowed to preserve by means of limitations attached to their acceptance of a Federal matter, no question of the discharge of the Governor-General&apos;s special responsibility arises, since the effect of the limitation is to render the Federation incompetent to modify or annul the right in question, its competence in disputed cases being determined by the Federal Court. But where the retention of a right has not v been thus specifically secured in the instrument of Accession, its protection is a matter wholly for the discretion of the Governor-General in the exercise of his special responsibility. It is evident that the degree and extent of such protection must inevitably depend upon the political conditions prevailing at the time.11. I propose to authorise the Viceroy to initiate, action with a view to the early communication to the States of an offer of terms of accession on the lines which I have explained, and I now ask my colleagues for authority to do so.India Office,21st July 1938.Z.
