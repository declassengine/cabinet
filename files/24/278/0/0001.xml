(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET.A Bill confirming the Customs Resolutions of the Manx legislature is passed annually.The Isli of Man has a separate financial existence levying its own taxes and defraying its own expenditure.    In particular it is completely free as to Customs duties subject to confirmation by the Imperial Parliament.    It would be unprecedented for parliament to alter the duties.The effect of the Resolutions to be confirmed by this Bill is to continue certain duties which are imposed in the Island annually and to apply to the Isle of Man modifications in the Customs tariff that are made in this country by the Finance Bill in the case of goods (other than sugar which is not dutiable in the Isle of Man) chargeable with duties under enactments other than the Import Duties Act.      Duties under the Import Duties Act are imposed in the Isle of Man by Statutory Order not requiring confirmation ex post facto by the Imperial Parliament.      This year&apos;s Bill also confirms Resolutions bringing the Isle of Man Customs arrangements into line with ours regarding ^the removal of special duties on certain goods imported from Eire and the taking of power. in certain circumstances to impose duties on eggs and poultryCoP.  166 (58).COPY NO.CABINET,ISLE OF MAN (OUSTOMSJ .,BILL?  1958.Memo randam by the Chancellor: of the Exchequer.exported from Eire to the Island,
Tile Bill is practically formal and usually occupies very little Parliamentary time       There is no reason to anticipate any discussion this year.      The Bill should he passed into law.before the House rises for the Summer Recess and as there is no convenient meeting of the Home Affairs Committee I venture,  in view of the nature of the Bill and of the short time available,  to circulate the Bill to the Cabinet without prior consideration by the Home Affairs Committee:Authority is requested to introduce the Bill immediately and to proceed with it at once,  subject to any drafting or other minor amendments that may be found necessaryo(intd.)
