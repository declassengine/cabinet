SECRET.L I NTRODUCT I ON.Progress of Provincial Autonomy %In the Congress Provinces the anniversary of acceptance of office has arecently been celebrated: In the other Provinces provincial autonomy is now sixteen months old. The Punjab Ministry alone has continued in office without change throughout the whole period. Bengal has followed the example of Assam and shed a recalcitrant Minister (though without filling his place). The Congress record also, with the recent storms in the Central Provinces, has not been immune from disturbance. But a broad view of British India shows a steady advance on the path marked out by the new constitution : the provincial governments have everywhere, with greater or less resolution, asserted them-selves as the guardians of public order j the legislatures have been heavily engaged in implementing the programmes of the dominant parties : and political activity in the Provinces, much of which has for so long been occupied With conflict aad negation, has turned to constructive tasks, pursuing (not without division) the natural lines of local interests,2. The measure of the advance in the Congress Provinces may be taken by considering some apprehensions widely felt at the time Congress consented to take office, and inspired by the proclaimed objects of that acceptance. First, it Was no unfair surmise that Congress in 20ower might deliberately contrive the crushing of the Services : for the Secretary of State&apos;s Services conditions might be made intolerable and their extinction might be achieved : the other important Services, so long ranged against Congress, would be brought to their luiees and made conscious of their subordination to new masters.Secondly, privilege and property everywhere would be assailed : labour would be dangerously encouraged, the income of the landlord would be turned into other channels, his authority would be paralysed, and his rights of owner-ship severely curtailed. As against British Imperialism, the constitutional scheme would he so handled as.to &quot; wreck the Act &quot; : every power given by it to the representatives of India would be exploited against the intentions of Parlia-ment, every safeguard in the hands of the Governor, the Governor-General, and the Secretary of State would he circumvented : and the new machinery of govern-mcnt would he so used as to weld the people of India into a solid mass endowed With the strength, and inspired with the will, to -win independence in the next inevitable conflict with Britain.3. No pretence will be made that every such surmise has proved to he a mere chimera. The rights of the Services have been invaded, and the invasion is by no means spent : yet the attack has taken colourable pretexts, and it call scarcely be claimed that every officer must he guaranteed under new conditions all the privileges and amenities of the old regime. The Congress treatment of industrial capitalism has not been marked by communistic intentions. The assault on rights in land is in some Provinces frankly expropriatory : but (with some exceptions) willingness to compromise has heen shewn ; and what is most open to criticism is the hasty and clumsy method of the assault, and its doubtful value to the interests of the general community.Purther, when due weight has heen given to every activity of Congress Ministries and of the Congress High Command, it is impossible not to feel that the main strength of the party has gone into the tasks- of administration rather than into preparation for renewed revolt.If provincial autonomy in action, not only in the Congress Provinces, has shown signs of inefficiency^ it has to he remembered that a fair comparison is rather with democratic self-government in other parts of the world than with the working of the old bureaucratic machine in India. ,  ,4. That Congress influence will spread seems a fairly safe prediction. The Indian States are no longer the secure home of autocracy. Of the non-Congress Provinces, only the Punjab can be said to stand firm on a policy^framed without reference to the will of &quot;Congress. But there are increasing signs of policy following local needs more than dictation from outside or above. In the N.-W. P. P. a Congress Ministry has difficulty in imposing on the people a measure framed on orthodox Congress Hues : in the Punjab  a   strong  anti-3ls196hd
2Congress Ministry has fathered agrarian measures which, are approved T)y the Congress High Command but distasteful to the locaL Congress party : and in. the Congress itself the division between right wing and left wing is becoming-more pronounced. Thus Congress is coming to mean something other than ai policy framed mainly against British Imperialism, and is taking on new shades, in its adaptation to local circumstances.5. A confident prediction that British India is now wedded to provincial autonomy would, however, ignore certain incalculable factors. Frustration still threatens the comfortable pursuit of ordinary political aims. It may come; from the communal differences that cut deeply across the path j or from such unfounded suspicions as were shewn in the Orissa crisis of April and the C. P. crisis of July. Gandhi has accused Iris fellow-Indians of &quot; slave mentality &apos;7 z his own domination is in fact based on an unreasoning subservience. When from time to time he confesses to moods of depression or &quot;darkness&quot;, these prove to be warnings of some outburst liable to disturb the political equilibrium of India. It is however a wholesome sign that the latest thunderbolt directed from Wardha designed to subdue Ministers and Governors who ignore the Olympian will has provoked outspoken questioning among; the faithful.II. CONGRESS PROVINCES.(a) Ministries ; stability and reputation.6. Bihar. -The Ministry&apos;s position appears to he declining&quot;. The Ministers are too few to cope with the work and the Premier is unwilling- to increase their number. The Finance Minister has spent months in hospital as the result of a motor accident. The Ministers are not too happy among- themselves and their capacity for surmounting the difficulties now before them is doubtful. The controversy over the employment of Bengalis under the Provincial Government has not subsided : the small number of Bengalis in the Province is considered to have obtained an unduly high proportion of the posts, and feeling between the two communities runs high. At the end of July the Congress Working Com-committee authorised Bajendra Prasad to investigate this controversy and to settle it finally ; pending the settlement they appealed to the Press and all others concerned to desist from agitation. Connected with this dispute is a demand for the constitution of Chota Nagpur as a separate Province : though the Gov-ernment had no difficulty in showing that the proposal is fantastic, it has not been killed. Agrarian and labour agitation is in the hands of extremists over whom the Ministry has slight control ; and the principal threat to the Govern-menfs stability comes from its ineffectiveness in dealing with the problems of industry and the land.7. Bombay. This Ministry has established a reputation for administra-tion on sound lines. The Premier (Kher) is liked and respected : and his Home Minister (Munshi) shows vigour and good sense in dealing with any threat to public order. The Ministry is, however, peculiarly susceptible to the influence of both Gandhi and Vallabliai Patel, and this has shown itself in the handling of the problem of the forfeited lands in Gujarat (see para. 129). It would cause general regret if the Cong-ress dictatorship, by forcing a crisis on this issue, cut short the life of the Ministry.8. Central Provinces. The record of the Khare Ministry during- the quarter has been one of ignominy. The affaire Sharif ended in the resignation of that Minister on May 21st. The report of the ex-Judge of the Calcutta High Court on Sharif&apos;s conception of the exercise of clemency made it impossible for him to remain in the Ministry : but the disappearance of the only Muslim Minister caused a good deal of feeling among Muhammadans, and certainly the handling by the Congress High Command of the other scandals in the Ministry has thrown into relief its attitude towards the erring Muslim. Sharif had hopes of reinstatement, and his fate was to have been discussed in the Working Committee meeting called for July 23rd : but meanwhile the Ministry of which he had been a member ceased to exist.The main clue to the vicissitudes of the Ministry is to be found in the enmity between the Mahakoshal and Maharashtra elements, mentioned in paragraph 5 of Survey No. 1. Given the low standards of decency of a number of the remaining six Ministers, it was not difficult for factious spirit to find material for mutual recrimination.
The Premier (Khare) belongs to Maharashtra : the three Ministers of the opposite faction resigned early in May : they withdrew their resignations -almost at once, but the Congress Working Committee directed the Premier (as -leader of the party in the Province) to call a party meeting to settle the Ministry&apos;s differences : Vallabhai Patel then intervened and imposed on the Ministers an &quot; amicable agreement &quot; which proved to be worthless. Most of the Ministers had been guilty of nepotism, and some of them of worse practices. Vallabhai Patel professed to have investigated these scandals : his public verdict was that the more serious charges were not proven : but his finding that the Ministry had shewn &quot; administrative inefficiency &quot;, coupled with,, the terms of the settlement, was sufficient to expose the Ministry to con-tempt. These terms were that the Ministry should submit to control by a board -consisting of the Presidents of the three Congress sub-committees of the Pro-vince ; that all relations and friends of the Ministers who had obtained -advantages- by undue influence should surrender them ; and that the portfolios should be redistributed. Vallabhai Patel and Khare are known to be on bad terms ; and the requirement that Khare should give up the important &apos;&apos; law and order &quot; portfolio was probably designed to make his position intolerable.However that may be, the handling of this matter was futile settling-nothing, exacerbating the internal dissensions of the Ministry, and bringing it into contumely. Disruption could be the only sequel. Khare anticipated the attack on himself by launching one against Misra (Minister for Local Self-Government) whose disreputable character made him an easy mark. Tho Congress High Command refused to allow him to demand Misra&apos;s resignation. The pace then quickened as the Working Committee, meeting at Wardha on July .23rd, was to decide the Ministry &apos;s fate and Khare at this stage was determined to decide it himself. The extraordinary events of the next few days were as follows : July 20th. Khare tendered the resignation of the Ministry, with the con-currence of his two Maharashtra colleagues but without that of the three Mahakoshal Ministers. As the latter refused to resign without orders from the Working Committee, the Governor met them and gave them time to consult Vallabhai Patel at Wardha. Meanwhile (midnight) the Governor accepted the resignation of the other Ministers.July 21st (early morning). The Mahakoshal Ministers, after discussion with Patel, required postponement till the Working Committee should meet on the 23rd. The Governor (being left without a Premier) then terminated their tenure of office. Khare, being called on to form another Ministry, resumed office, along with Deslrmukh and Gole (the Maharashtra members of the defunct Council) and two new men from Mahakoshal.July 22ncl- (midnight). Khare, having been summoned to Wardha to give an account of his doings, made his submission, and telephoned to the Governor that as the Congress President and the Parliamentary Sub-Committee had con-vinced him of the error of his ways, he must resign along with the new Ministry.July 23rd. Khare tendered formal resignation. Vallabhai Patel, as President of the Congress Parliamentary Sub-Committee, issued a communique at Wardha baldly recounting the facts and reproducing the letter of resignation.The Governor met Khare and told him he could not accept the resignation at once as he needed time to consider the situation. Khare went back to Wardha. After he met the Working Committee it was announced that night that he had called a meeting of the Provincial Congress Legislative Party for the 27th to elect a new leader.July 24th.-The Governor met Khare, who agreed to remain in office till after the meeting of the 27th.July 26th. The Working Committee passed a resolution which condemned Khare for grave errors of judgment and gross indiscipline : his resignation &quot; was the direct cause for the exercise, for the first time since office acceptance, bv a Governor of his special powers, whereby Dr. Khare&apos;s three colleagues were dismissed &quot; : he had thereby proved himself unworthy of holding positions of responsibility in the Congress organisation.   The resolution continued :&quot; The Working Committee have also come to the reluctant conclusion that the Governor of the C. P. has shown, by the ugly haste with which he has turned night into day and forced the crisis that has overtaken the province, that he was eager to weaken and discredit the Congress in so far as it lay in him to do so. The Working Committee hold that, knowing as he must have what was going on among members of the Cabinet and the instructions of the Parlia-
meiltary Sub-Committee, he ought not to have with unseemly haste-accepted the resignation of the three Ministers and demanded the resignation of the other three, dismissed them on their refusal to resign, and immediately called upon Dr. Khare to form a new Ministry and sworn in available members of the new Ministry without waiting for the meeting of the Working Committee which was im-minent,&quot;July 27th.-The G. P. Assembly Congress Party met at Wardha : Subhas Bose presided and three members of the Congress Parliamentary Sub-Committee-(including Vallahhai Patel) were present : Khare &apos;s name was not put forward : the voting resulted in 46 votes for Pandit Bavi Shankar Shukla (one of Khare&apos;s. late Mahakoshal colleagues) and 12 for Deshmukh (one of his late Maharashtra colleagues).July ScStf/j.-The Governor saw Khare and took his formal advice, which was that he shoidd send for Shukla and ask him to form a Ministry.July 29th. Shukla (who had been constantly absent at Wardha) met the Governor and named his Ministry Shukla, Mehta and Misra (the Mahakoshal group in the previous Ministry), S. V. Gokhale (a Brahman pleader of Maharashtra), and C. J. Bharuka (a Marwari). Two places were still to be filled if possible, from Muslims and depressed classes. The resignation of the (second) Khare Ministry was accepted, and the five new Ministers were sworn in.9. It was known that the Congress leaders at Wardha, after hearing the-version of the Mahakoshal Ministers on the 22nd, intended to make it appear that the crisis had been engineered by the Governor, taking advantage of Khare&apos;s greed for office, in order to foment dissensions among the Ministry and thereby weaken Congress. The issue of the colourless communique on the 23rd gave the impression that this extraordinary design had been abandoned. It was therefore a surprise when the resolution of the 26th (said to have been drafted by Gandhi himself) condemned the Governor for plotting against the Congress. As to this charge, it is sufficient to state that up till that date the Congress Press had contained scarcely a word of criticism of the Governors-conduct of the crisis. A typical comment is that of the &quot; Hindu &quot; (Madras) of July 21st which emphatically placed the blame for the ciisis on Khare, described the conduct of the three dissident Ministers in refusing to resign as-wrong, and said that the Governor, &quot; placed between a Prime Minister who pressed for the acceptance of his resignation and those Ministers who urged that no action should he taken before the views of the Congress Working Com-mittee were known, had no option but to act on the Prime Minister&apos;s advice.&quot;&apos; The &quot; Hindustan Times &quot; (Delhi) on July 23rd accused Khare of a &quot; grave blunder which the Working Committee cannot condone &quot; : he had &quot; played right into the hands of the Mahakoshal group which with a correctitude not above suspicion has placed itself entirely in the hands of the Working Com-mitteo &quot;. In this issue there was no word of criticism of the Governor. A leader in the same paper on the 24th blamed the Governor for ignoring the probable attitude of the Working Committee, hut added that &quot; there is no slurring the uncomfortable fact that the primary responsibility for the situation is Dr. Khare&apos;s and not the Governor&apos;s &quot; : and continued that the action of the Governor had in fact had the welcome result of vindicating the principle of joint responsibility of Ministers. Until the publication of the resolution this mild rebuke was practically the only criticism of the Governor : and a different view was taken by, for instance, the &quot; Tribune &quot; of Lahore (a Congress paper), which vigorously condemned the Working Committee for attempting to sap the-constitutional position by interference with the free action of a Ministry. The &quot; Amrita Bazar Patrika &quot; (Calcutta) of July 26th stated that the responsibility for the use of the Governor&apos;s power of dismissal lay on the three recalcitrant Ministers and those who advised them.The resolution has had a &quot;had Press &quot; in Congress circles : in fact there is no action of the Working Committee since Congress Ministries took office which has been so freely and severely criticised by the faithful. The &quot; Hindu &quot; of July 27th after condemning the interference with the free choice of a leader by the Provincial party, remarks that no evidence has been put forward in support of the allegations against the Governor : it was in fact Khare who forced the issue : the Governor had no option but to agree, and the recalcitrant Minis-ters brought dismissal on themselves &quot; by refusing to resign in the face of all constitutional precedent&quot; : the Working Committee had no right to quarrel with the Governor for not waiting for a lead from itself :  the U. P.-Bihar crisis
&apos;of February is clearly distinguishable : the serious charges against the Governor &apos; should, if they cannot be substantiated, be withdrawn and the Working Com-committee should dispel the impression made by Khare&apos;s allegation that he was required to agree that there should be no joint responsibility among Ministers, that Ministers should not be primarily responsible to the Prime Minister, and that they should be severally responsible to the High Command.The &quot; Tribune &quot; of July 28th was even more outspoken in criticism and in refutation of the charge against the Governor. The &quot; Free Press Journal &quot; -(Bombay : a paper of the extreme Congress left) remarked that the Governor&apos;s .only- error was that he acted constitutionally. The &quot; Hindustan Times &quot; is virtually alone among important papers in taking the view that the Governor hehaved with &quot;narrow constitutionalism&quot;. The &quot;Leader&quot; (Allahabad: non-Congress) has bitterly attacked &quot; Congress Fascism &quot; under the domina-tion of Gandhi.It can be surmised that the condemnation of the Governor in the- resolution is a measure of the&quot; Working Committee &apos;s ill-humour both at the circumstances of the crisis and at their inability to cleanse this Augean stable.The determination to leave nothing to chance, or to the free choice of the Provincial Congress party, is shewn by the virtual excommunication of Khare, by the holding of the party meeting at Wardha, and by its domination by Subhas Bose in the chair and other leaders in attendance. But the solution can have given the Working Committee little satisfaction : the three Mahakoshal Ministers are soiled with the dust of past dissension, and one of them (Misra) is believed to be disliked by Gandhi for his disreputable moral character : further, no one supposes that the new Ministry will be any great, improvement on the old or is assured of stability.The submergence of Khare must cause some regret. He has shown himself a small man, inadequate to the responsibilities of Premiership ; and his fall must be attributed largely to his own childish volatility and impulsiveness ? but he showed qualities of decency which were absent in some of his colleagues. The re-cord of his successor, Shukla, as Minister does not rouse large hopes of his success as Premier..1.0. Of Gandhi&apos;s mood of disgust mention has been made elsewhere. The C. P. events have admittedly done much to inspire it. A candid critic of them has leen Dr. Raghavendra Rao, who in letters to Gandhi denounced in the most vigo-rous terms the contrast between the baseness of Congress action and the smug purity of the Ganclhian ideal. Gandhi, quoting expurgated passages of the letters in the &quot; Harijan &quot;.. replied in mild terms and invited Raghavendra Rao to return to the Congress fold. Till then there had been some talk of Raghavendra Rao re-entering politics in the C. P., and even of his becoming Premier as the head of a coalition, with the connivance *if not the assistance of Congress. But the publi-cation of the correspondence has probably made irreparable the breach between him and the Congress High Command.11. Madras. It would be a fair criticism of Bajagopalachari&apos;s administration that the natural self-confidence and autocracy of the Brahman, confirmed by the overwhelming strength of the Congress party in the Legislature and outside, has induced a dictatorial attitude which may in time provoke effective opposition. None of his colleagues can make his weight felt : and the Premier is prepared to suppress all agitation against his policy. But the Premier V opponents have profited by the lessons Congress has taught to those who desire to obstruct autho-rity. The agitation against compulsory Hindi in schools (see paragraph 27) sur-,vives in spite of severe repression. The Telugus (Audhras) resent the predo-minance of the Tamil element, and in prosecuting their demand for a separate Anclhra Province may split the local Congress party. Nevertheless the adminis-tration of the Presidency ranks high. There has been labomr trouble, but it has not been allowed to get out of hand : the agrarian question is not a serious one : finances are still sound : the strength of the Services has not been sapped : and there is as yet no sign of the rise of any party that can challenge the supremacy of Congress..12. North-West Frontier Province. The relations of Dr. Khan Sahib (the Premier) with the Congress Working Committee are discussed below (para-graph 22). The Ministry gives the impression of being unusually indifferent to Congress orthodoxy, thereby reflecting the Province &apos;s divergence from the poli-tical tendencies of other parts of India. Though the Premier&apos;s independence was somewhat checked as the result of Gandhi&apos;s visit to the Province in Mav, Congress princinles sit lightly on him. The ccmmunalism of Qazi Ataullah (Revenue and &quot;Education Minister) detracts from his political orthodoxy : andLS196HD
the one Hindu member of the Cabinet (Bhanju Ram, Finance Minister) is not entirely comfortable with &quot;his colleagues. The coolness between Bhanju Ram and yazi Ataullah is increasing, not only through communal differences but also because the latter to enhance his popularity follows a revenue policy incompatible with sound finance.Khan Sahib &apos;s brother, the &quot; Frontier Gandhi &quot;,. is the main personality outside the legislature : but even his &quot; Red Shirt &quot; organisation is formally independent of Congress.Early in May the Frontier Assembly Congress party adopted unanimously a resolution expressing full confidence in the Ministry ; but reports indicate that it was not all plain sailing and that the Cabinet had to agree to consultation with the party in all matters of policy. In June it was decided to form an advisory committee of eight, whom the Ministry are supposed to consult before passing, orders. The Ministry&apos;s programme, particularly the Agriculturists&apos; Relief Bill, meets with criticism : this Bill, drafted in a hurry for propaganda purposes,, is now proving an embarrassment : Bhanju Ram, as the leader of the Hindus in the Province, is specially inconvenienced by it : and his followers are likely to? make capital of the fact that its terms will benefit two of the Ministers who are believed to he heavily in debt..13. Orissa. The last Survey (paragraph 11) brought the controversy re-garding the appointment of Mr. Dain as Governor up to the point where Gandhi and Subhas Bose were threatening to create an all-India crisis out of it. On. May 4th, the Governor issued a communique stating that in view of the instahi-lity of the political situation he had no option but to ask for the cancellation of his leave, in the interests of the Province. Mr. Dain retired almost at once ;. he was in any case due to retire after his period of acting Governorship.Thus from the Congress point of view an unwelcome appointment was successfully thwarted by the threat of bringing out all the Congress Ministries&apos; in protest. In the circumstances some jubilation over a great victory was in-inevitable : but for the most part Congress opinion, which had been genuinely perturbed in some Provinces by the prospect of Ministerial resignations, was-sober in its comment on the outcome. Among the services there was some natural apprehension that the first step had been taken in conceding the demand that Governorships should no longer be open to them. A statement in the House of Commons made it clear that there is no such intention. The subsequent appoint-ment of Mr. Boag, an Indian Civil Servant from Madras, to act as Governor of Orissa, has attracted no adverse comment worth mentioning.The position of the Premier, Biswanath Das, seems to he insecure. His faults of temper and poor ability unfit him for leadership : and it has not escaped criticism that a provision in a recent Tenancy Bill (reserved for the considera-tiOn of the Governor-General) will directly profit him and his family. The Ministry appears inadequate to its task, and to the control of the increasing acti-vities of extremist politicians. The experience of the C. P. shows that disunion (see parag-raph 11 of the last Survey) is not easily healed by intervention from outside. There is however little sign of the landed interests which have been attacked in the pending tenancy legislation obtaining sufficient power to upset the Ministry.14. United Provinces. The main problems of the U. P. have heen communal enmity, labour unrest and agrarian agitation all of which contain the seeds of public disorder. Each subject is considered separately elsewhere&apos;: the com-munal problem is a special one : but as regards agrarian and labour agitation, the Ministry&apos;s endeavour has been to divest itself of the extremism which charac-terised the party before the responsibilities of administration were assumed. So far as the endeavour has lacked resolution, the Ministry&apos;s policy shows vacilla-tion, which is not altogether foreign to the Premier&apos;s temperament. But the general tendency has heen towards the Right, with a widening cleavage from the extremer elements. The settlement of the Cawnpore strike (see paragraph 105) has for the moment increased the prestige of the Ministry, and particularly that of the Premier whose personal intervention produced the final agreement. The agrarian problem remains to he solved : if, as appears possible, the solution proves such as to cause grievous disappointment to the expectations of the left-wing, the Ministry&apos;s stability may be seriously threatened.(b) Legislatures : events of the Sessions.15. Bihar. Both Houses of the Legislature were sitting at the beginning of May and have been in session at intervals ever since. The important business before them was the agrarian legislation which is described in paragraph 88.   An
Sameiidsasait to  he P-iohibition Bill exempts from its provisions -the use &apos;o  wine lor religious purposes -a concession to cue Christian community-.&apos;&apos;-A Members&apos; Salaries rsili, which, passed through both Houses, allows -members a daily allow--anee of Rs. 3 and travelling allowance at the rate of-four -third class railway-fares-, in addition to a-monthly salary of Rs. 75. The Assembly passed a resolution con-&apos;demning- Federation, so -mildly worded that it came in for opposition criticism ; and another -resolution against the grant of titles. . ,16. Bombay: -Both Houses of the Legislature, which were in session at the heginning of May, adjourned on May 7lh. The statement in paragraph 23 of the last Survey that the Trade Disputes Bill was introduced is incorrect ; at was not ready for the Legislature and will he introduced at the next session. On May 2nd the Assembly passed a Bill to amend the Bombay Race Courses Licensing Act which provides for Government levying a license fee On the Turf Club ; the object of the Bill is to make it clear that Government has the power to require certain &quot;conditions from the Club before renewing its licence. Bills to amend the Primary Education Act and the Bombay Municipal Act passed through both Houses ; the Council also passed the Race Courses Licensing Bill and the City Police Act Amending Bill referred to in paragraph 23 of the last Survey.The Ministry never had any doubt about their majority in either House ; the Opposition is still so divided that it has little chance of forming a united &quot;front, though it is vigilant enough to make Ministers tread cautiously.1.7. Orhstt-The Assembly resumed its sessioii on May 2nd, after a month&apos;s recess ; it sat for only four days during which agrarian legislation was con-si dered (see paragraph &apos;93) .v18. United Provinces.-The Legislative Council held a session from May 7th to May 2oth.   Eight Bills passed by the Assembly were discussed, and no less than five will have to go hack to the Assembly for consideration of the &quot;amendments made by the &quot;tipper House including the Court Fees Amending Bill.   The Council passed unaltered the Members&apos; Emoluments Bill.In a recent article in the &quot; Harijan Gandhi has endorsed, though on differ-eht grounds, the decision embodied in the TJnited Provinces Assembly resolution, mentioned in paragraph 28 of the last Survey, that the Speaker should he allowed to^ participate in politics outside the House. Gandhi, however. Would permit this only with such adherence to the highest principles as in effect would prevent Speaiker being politically prominent.(c) Relations of Ministries with the Central Congress Command.19. The tight control of the Congress High Command over Provincial Ministries has been maintained : and the ignominous defeat of the one Premier (Rhare in the Central Provinces) who has made a struggle for independence has re-affirmed it in the most positive terms c but the very rigour of the Working /Committee &apos;s action in that crisis has provoked question.The &quot;Working Committee is reported to have made two concessions as a re-sult of the Premiers&apos; Conference held in May (see paragraph 11.0) ; Provincial Governments may have a free hand in dealing with communal unrest, and each Province can settle the duties of Parliamentary Secretaries in its own way. Even so it is significant that Munshi, Home Minister of Bombay, consulted the Working Committee before using the &quot; repressive &quot; Press (Emergency Powers) Act to suppress a communal newspaper after the April riots.The following incidents will illustrate the dictation exercised Over Provincial affairs. Gandhi &apos;s Word is still supreme, and Vallabhai Patel (President of the Parliamentary Sub-Committee) is a fig&apos;ure of growing importance.20. The Orissa crisis, over the appointment of Mr. Daiii has been described (paragraph 13). There seems no doubt that the Working Committee was pre-pared to make it an all-India crisis without consulting Provincial Ministries.21. After the Working Committee had banned his European tour (see para-graph 34 of the last Survey), the Speaker of the Madras Assembly asked the Working Committee for permission to resign his office, giving the excuse that he wished to be free to work for Congress without the worries of office. He was persuaded to withdraw his request.22. The independent behaviour of Khan Sahib, the Premier of the North-West Frontier Province, Avas described in paragraph 32 of the last Survey. It was a further indication of his insubordination that he had &quot; boycotted &quot; three
meetings of the Working Committee in. succession. Gandhi &apos;s visit to- the Fronv ter probably had a disciplinary intention. Khan Sahib hoped, by arranging a heavy programme for his formidable guest, to evade a reckoning : but Gandhi revised the programme, and Khan, Sahib was. brought to. heel; he publicly affirm-ed his allegiance to the. Working committee.,, attended its next meeting and also the Premiers&apos; Conference.Khan Sahib has, however,, ag;ain been in trouble over. the. re-instatemeni of the Muslim official mentioned in paragraph 32 of the last Survey. He promised the Premiers&apos; Conference that he would see what could be done about, it -7 nothing was&apos;done, so. Nehru informed him in June that the re-instaiement was a political blunder which should be remedied. Shortly after this Khan Sahib piibllcly stated that if any community felt-aggrieved he.would reconsider the case ab initio ; but this promise, was. severely criticised by Gandhi who said he could not understand the necessity for further enquiry if the official concerned was really innocent. However, no action seems to have heen taken.23. The Congress Working Committeers intervention in the Bengali Bihari controversy has already been mentioned (paragraph 6).The Working Committee&apos;s, treatment of the C. P. difficulties has already heen described. At one stage of the recent deliberations the leaders seem to have heen flirting with the idea of requiring assurances from the Governor as a condition for allowing&apos;a Congress Ministry to, take office : and, failing these assur-ances, to have intended to provoke a crisis throughout the Congress Provinces. It is pretty certain that the Congress Premiers had not (any more than over the Orissa crisis of April) been consulted.The intervention of Gandhi and Vallabhai. Patel in the affair of the Gujarat lands in Bombay is dealt with elsewhere in this Survey. The Bihar Ministry&apos;s difficulties over agrarian legislation were eased only by the intervention of a mem-ber of the Working Committee.24. In the non-Congress Province of the Punjab, a member of the Working Committee was deputed to settle the quarrels in the Provincial Congress, party s and effected a sort of agreement. Later, the central command in the curtest language ordered the Congress members of the Assembly not to oppose the mi-popular agrarian legislation (see paragraph 94) ; though the order was obeyed, the effect of the strain on the party&apos;s allegiance may prove considerable.25. The ban on social contacts, has not heen relaxed ; many Provincial. Ministers give the impression that they would like to see it lifted, but in Bihar the Ministry, when asked to dine with the Governor on the King&apos;s birthday, had to refuse after taking orders from the Working- Committee. Khan Sahib is believed to have pressed for greater independence in, such matters at the Pre-. miers&apos; Conference.26. The &quot; Vidya Mandir &quot; scheme. (See paragraph 35 of the last Survey.) Slow progress has heen made with the introduction of this new educational scheme, which hut for Gandhi&apos;s connection with it would hardly have won much attention. The first &quot; Vidya Mandirs &quot; will probably open in the Central Provinces in October when the- teachers should have completed their training. The Madras Government have under consideration the introduction of the scheme in selected centres during the next school year, and the Bihar Government have decided to introduce it on a small experimental scale by opening one &quot; Vidya Mandir in each district next year. The Central Advisory Board of Education met in Simla in June to consider the scheme, under the presidency of the Bombay Premier. Without some further stimulus from Gandhi it is doubtful whether the &quot; Vidya Mandir &quot; ideal has much chance of general acceptance even in the Congress Provinces.27. Use of Hindi. Reference has already heen made to the agitation against the introduction by the Madras Ministry of compulsory Hindi in over 100 secondary schools. The agitation has heen specially directed against the Pre-mier, and his house has heen. picketed almost daily. Rajagopalachari lias no temperamental prejudice against the use of &quot; repressive &quot; methods. Severe sentences (a yearv&apos;s imprisonment in one case) have heen imposed : and much comment, and some disapproval among the Congress orthodox, has been excited by the use against the demonstrators of Section 7 of the Criminal Law Aniend-&apos;merit Act, 1932 which provides a punishment for molesting a person to the pre-iudice of his employment or business.Though the protest ha&quot;s heen taken up as a political device for discrediting-the Congress mainly by nOn-Bralnuans of the Tamil Nad, there is behind it a genuine feeling that the importation of Hindi is a threat to the Pravidian culture of the South, and yet another sign that Congress policy is dictated by north Indians.
9 fi 9^d) Relations of Ministers with i&amp;overnors : social contacts : special responsibility-facilities.28. There is nothing fresh to report about the relations between Governors and their Ministers.&apos; The Premier of the North-West Frontier Province, who was taken to task for his behaviour during the Viceroy&apos;s visit to Peshawar in April, has stated privately that his action (as reported in paragraph 38 of the last Survey) received some support at the Congress Premiers&apos; Conference in May : but he seems to have made his submission, to Gandhi during the latter&apos;s visit to Peshawar, and could plead no stronger excuse than the tradition of Pathan hospitality.All the Ministers who happened to be at headquarters when the new Gov-ernors of Bihar, the Central Provinces and the United Provinces took charge, attended the installation ceremonies ; in Bihar and the United Provinces Parliamentary Secretaries also were present. In the Central Provinces the -Ministers consented to be photographed with the Governor ; they failed to appear at Government House to meet him on his arrival, apparently owing to some difference of opinion between the Premier and his colleagues.In Orissn the Ministers did not attend the King&apos;s Birthday Parade. The Governor of Bihar asked his Premier whether he and his colleagues would attend an official dinner on the King&apos;s Birthday ; the Ministers took time to decide, evidently in order to consult higher authority, and then declined ; hut all arranged to he on tour away from headquarters on the occasion of the dinner. The Provincial Congress Committee of the United Provinces has recently banned any participation by Congressmen in farewell or welcome parties given to Government officials.29. Special responsibilities mid &quot; discretion &quot;. No instance of a Governor over-riding his Ministry in the exercise of his special responsibility has come to notice in the quarter under review. In the ease of the release of the Madras prisoners (described in paragraph 78), the issue was not such as to warrant the exercise of the Governor-General&apos;s power to direct the imposition of conditions.The attitude to be taken by Governors towards proposals for reduction in travelling&apos; allowances and abolition of special pay of Government servants is still under consideration. So is the problem of the Gujarat lands in Bombay (see paragraph 129) which may bring into play the Governor&apos;s special responsibility under section 299 of the Government of India Act.The trend of tenancy legislation in the Provinces has underlined the im-portance of that provision and of the clause in the Governors&apos; Instrument of Instructions which relates to it. No Bill making provision for the extlnguish-ment or modification of rights in land may he introduced without the previous sanction of the Governor in his discretion : and when such a Bill has been passed, it is necessary for a Governor, &quot;with regard to the Instrument, to decide which of the courses described in section 75 of the Act he shall take. The Tenancy Bills that have come to notice are described in Part V (/) below : but in general it may be said that they all have needed careful consideration in order to decide whether their effect on rights in land or land revenue is or is not such as to justify refusal of assent.As regards other legislation, the Governor of the North-West Frontier Pro-vince is the first to have refused assent to a Bill passed by the Assemhly the private Bill for the repeal of the sedition section of the Indian Penal Code and for other modifications of the law against disorder, which was mentioned in paragraph 80 of the last Survey. The refusal has naturally attracted comment : some Congress newspapers hopefully saw in it occasion for a Ministerial crisis, hut other Congress comment has regarded the Bill as going too far : and the Ministry has given no encouragement to protest.(e) Relations of Ministries with their Secretariats : methods of business.30. In the Appendix will be found a summary of the views of Governors on the subject of the strain imposed on Secretariat (and other) officers by the work-ing of the new Constitution. It will he seen that, in a number of Provinces the strain on Secretariat officers is, from various causes, severe. In other respects also the.process of adjustment between Congress Ministries and the machinery of Government has proved uneasy. The matter is considered further in Part V (a) below.In May it was reported that the Working Committee had issued instructions io Premiers to keep in mind the excessive powers of permanent officials as al319ghd
possible pretext for a dead-lock if occasion should arise ; hut there has heen no development of this line of attack.An incident worth mention occurred in the North-West Frontier Province, where the. Education Minister earned: unpopularity by interference with a. local body.   A District Board unanimously elected a Secretary and were instructed&apos; by the Minister to reconsider their choice ;   they then reappointed the   same person, and were informed that the. appointment was rejected.IllNON-CONGRESS PROVINCES.(a) Ministries ; stability and reputation.31, Assam. The Ministry still survives the efforts of the Congress, party to-upset it. The two Ministers who were, dropped when the Cabinet was reorga-liised in February (see. paragraph. 41 of the last Survey) are still in opposition, though some of their followers have returned to the Ministerial fold.One of the ex-Ministers is said to have been promised office in a Congress-coalition Cabinet when this is formed. Both ex-Ministers are understood to have promised their support to a motion of no-confidence in the Ministry to be brought during the next session of the Legislature. The Ministry&apos;s majority is so small that the issue cannot be foretold.32. Bengal-The Congress&apos; hopes of forming a coalition Government seem to be in abeyance. The session of the Muslim League in Calcutta in April&apos; appears to have given the Ministry encouragement and confidence.The importance of the Tenancy Bill (see paragraph 87) to the, prestige of the Ministry is indicated by the Premier &apos;s announcement that if it does not reach the statute-book he will have to resign. So far as things have gone, the fate of the Bill does not appear likely to reduce him to that necessity.The conduct of Nausher Ali, Minister for Local Self-Government, had been worrying his colleagues for some time, for reasons mentioned in paragraph 42 of the last Survey. The rift widened : and his leanings toward the opposition led to his disappearance from the Ministry. He resisted invitations to resign, and it became necessary for the whole Ministry to resign in order to get rid of him. (The same procedure was followed in Assam in February in somewhat similar circumstances). The resignation was on June 23rd. Fazlul Haq im-rnediately formed a new Cabinet consisting of the same members except Nausher Ali, whose place was not filled. The Labour Minister took over his portfolio.The Ministry depends on various quartei-s for support ; and the loss of a Minister might well have weakened its position, unless other support were pro-cured by replacing him. There has been some expectation that this would be done, or even that two more Ministers would he appointed to secure the allegiance of grorrps that have shown coolness towards the Government : but, the Premier has not yet felt the need for this step, or has found in it disadvantages outweighing&apos; the probable gain. The coming&quot; session of the Assembly will show whether the incident has appreciably weakened the Ministry&apos;s position.Tenancy and labour, in this Province as elsewhere, are problems that need careful handling : and the problem of &quot; ijolitical &quot; prisoners is a special one, the handling of which has called for strength and skill on the part of Nazim-uddin, the Home Minister. The dissensions among the Congress party conti-nue to benefit the Ministry : and Fazlul Haq is sufficiently adroit to use every advantage that is presented to him.33. Punjab.- The Ministry has maintained its position. The Shahidganj dispute has, temporarily at any rate, lapsed into the background, and the Ministry are at present absorbed hi the programme of agrarian legislation which they have recently introduced.During June some discontent was apparent in the Unionist party. About a dozen members of the Assembly were contemplating secession from the party and the formation of a new independent group. Their grievances were mainly personal, asrainst some of-the Ministers and some of the Parliamentary Secre-taries : there was never any intention to join the Congress opposition, and the &quot;Premier has succeeded&apos;in placating them.The Congress party in the Legislature continues to be ineffectual, and to he torn by dissensions in the Province.34. Sind. The Ministry, four months old, has led a precarious existence. During the Assembly session in May the Premier had to submit to the dictation of various warring groups, including Congress, and seems to have survived
mainly because plans for his downfall were incomplete. With continued disunion among the Muslim groups, the weight of the Congress party is out of all propor-iion to its size. ,Under section 52 of the Government of India Act the Governor of Sind has a special responsibility, in addition, to those common to all Governors, for &quot; secur-ing the proper administration of the Lloycl Barrage and Canals Scheme &quot;. This involved a revision of. the assessment imposed on the irrigated area a step which naturally placed the Ministry in an awkward situation. The Governor, who had postponed his leave in order that he might get this question settled, sought to obtain a decision before he was clue to leave at the beginning of August : a date which marks the commencement of the new revenue year in Sind. The problem was to keep pace with the programme for the enhancement of the revenue of the Province so as to meet the charges of the Barrage in accordance with the Niemeyer scheme, at a time when the low level of prices of the more important crops grown under this irrigation system would render any increase of rates both highly unpopular and difficult to enforce. The Government have passed orders accepting the principle of a sliding scale of assessment on the basis of prices, and levying the revised rates from the 1st August. The revised settlement is guaranteed for a period of five years. In accordance with the usual practice a period of two months has been allowed for the submission of objections to the revised rates. The decision has had a bad reception : and attempts are being made to require the Ministers to resign. The Congress party (whose strength in the legislature has recently been increased through a victory in a bye-election) is vocal in condemnation of the Ministry and expectant of advantage from the agitation. The Ministry Las shown real courage in facing hard facts : it is not yet clear whether they will be able to weather the storm.(b) Legislatures : events of the sessions.35. There has been no session of the Assam Legislature during the quarter. The Bengal Assembly session commenced on July 29th.36. Punjab. The Assembly was in session from June 20th to July 22nd. The most important business before the House was the agrarian legislation which is diseussed in paragraph 94. The threatened revolt among members of the Unionist party has been mentioned (paragraph 33). On the opening day of the session the Governor addressed the House : the Congress members absented themselves, partly as a protest against the waste of money because no other &quot;business was transacted on that day, and partly &quot; in accordance with general policy &quot;.Mention was made in paragraph 43 of the last Survey of the hostile attitude of the Press towards the Ministry. In this session the Premier introduced a Bill designed to curb the freedom of the Press : this is dealt with elsewhere (paragraph 107) as the main purpose of the measure is to check writing calcu-lated to foment communal enmity.The rules of procedure for the House have been completed and adopted.The Government never had any diffioultv in holdina- its own in the House, though the Opposition was active. The Speaker is getting old and appears unequal to the task of controlling a body the members of which are apt to allow themselves some latitude in debate ; the dignity of the Assembly proceedings has suffered and there have been numerous &quot; scenes &quot;. The Speaker &apos;s attitude to the use of the vernacular in the Legislature is mentioned elsewhere (para-graph 132).37. Sind. The Assembly session from May 19th to June 2nd demonstrated the palpable weakness of the Government position. The Premier&apos;s dependence on the support of groups who were anything but dependable forced him to yield constantly to pressure. It was probably only the knowledge that the collapse of the Ministry might mean the rise to power of the Muslim League which pre-served the Ministry from defeat. More legislation of the type passed in Congress Provinces was enacted. The Ministers&apos; Salaries Bill provides for a monthly salary of Rs. 500, with free house and conveyance allowance. The Members&apos; Salaries Bill also follows the Congress model, allowing members Rs. 75 a month ; but an amendment was adopted by which a member who does riot attend the meetings of the House is &quot; cut &quot; Rs. 5 a day unless his absence is unavoidable owing to sickness. Another Bill abolished the system of nominations to local bodies. An anti-Federation resolution was passed. A Bill imposing a 4 per cent, tax on moneys put into totalisators on race-courses was passed, and is expected to yield Rs. 70,000 annually.
&apos;     An estimate of the present grouping in the Sind Assembly may be corn-pared with that given in Appendix I to the first Survey.(1) The two Muhammadan Ministers with two followers 4(2) The Hindu Minister with four followers     .,             . - 5(3) Congress (10) with two labour and merchant members . , 12 (4) The ex-Premier Sir 6.

If the Ministry can avoid facing the Assembly till the agitation against that decision lias died down, time may be gained for winning the support of groups which at the moment are hostile.(c) Relations with Governors : social contacts r special responsibilities.38. The situation remains unchanged. The Sind Ministers&apos; agreement with the Governor over the revision of the Lloyd Barrage rates, discussed else-where, has, somewhat unexpectedly, avoided the exercise of his special respon-sibility.In Bengal there has been no conflict between the Governor and his Minis-ters over the terms of the Tenancy Bill.(d) Relations of Ministers with their Secretariats r methods of business.39. Remarks about Ministers&apos; relations with their Secretariat officers and their methods of business will be found in the Appendix.40. In Bengal some Ministers are incapable of keeping a secret. For instance, an outline of the proposals for the release of the terrorist prisoners (see paragraph 75) which were secretly communicated to Gandhi, found its way into the press probably through a Ministerial indiscretion. The Premier also permitted the press to publish the full correspondence which passed between himself and Nausher Ali before the latter&apos;s ejection from the Cabinet (see para-graph 32). There have been increasing complaints from district officers regarding attempted interference by Ministers, even those not responsible for the departments concerned, particularly relating to nominations to local bodies and police affairs.41. In the Punjab Ministers are apt to delay important orders and deci-sions which may affect their influential supporters. Local members of the Legislature use their influence with Ministers in a manner which cannot but discourage district officers.IV.-CHIEF COMMISSIONERS&apos; PROVINCES:42. djmer-Merivara.-A memorial asking for the amalgamation of Ajmer-Merwara with the United Provinces has been rejected by the Central Govern-ment, hut Congress keeps up its agitation on this subject. In a part of the Province where a. somewhat primitive type of landlordism (istimrari) prevails Congress agitation is attempting to exploit admitted grievances. Some arrests had to he made. ^ A special officer has reported on the steps necessary to redress the grievances, and the -report is under the consideration of the Central Govern-ment, which however may be hampered in giving effect to the recommendations by the defects in the legislative machinery mentioned in paragraph 56 of the last Survey.43. Coorg. Elections to the Coorg District Board held in May resulted in every seat being captured by Congress members.44. Delhi. Congress has been active in Delhi, directing its efforts against the &quot; autocratic &quot; administration.   Much publicity was given to an incident in
V,-GENERAL SUBJECTS.(a) Treatment of the Services : Service feeling : Services&apos; pay and allowances.46. There is little fresh to be said about the treatment of the Services in the non-Congress Provinces. In one such Province a tendency (probably not peculiar to that area) has been mentioned for Government servants with griev-ances to seek the aid of members of the Legislature.47. In the Congress Provinces no great change (and certainly no general date-rioration) in the attitude of Ministers towards the Services is noticeable. Men-tion has been made (in paragraph 13) of the agitation against the appointment of I. C. S. Governors consequent upon the crisis in Orissa over the appointment of Mr. Dain. This however has been only sporadic : by Congress leaders little has been said except by the President who considers that only non-official Indians should be appointed as Governors : and the appointment of five officiat-ing Governors from the I. C. S. has not met with any substantial protest.48. Jn Bombay the position of the Services is still satisfactory ; relations between the Police and Congress are improving, and Munshi (Home Minister) during a discussion about the reorganisation of the Police force admitted that it is essential to maintain the European element, though he added that he would not always be able to convince his colleagues of this. All the Services are believed to be agreeably surprised that so little change has occurred under a Congress Government. A Resolution will come up for discussion at the next session of the Legislative Council of this Province which, in addition to the Stereotyped denunciation of the award of titles, demands that the administra-tive machinery shall not be used in preparing recommendations, and that Government servants should be warned of disapproval of their accepting honours.49. An official letter issued in the Central Provinces about the improve-ment of relations between the Police and the public does not omit to mention that the attitude of the public to the Police requires modification and that abuse of, and allegations against, the Police should cease. The Police in this Province, how-ei^er, are reported to be somewhat depressed : an explanation given is that under the xjrevious administration (particularly as a result of the attitude of Dr. Raghavendra Rao, mentioned below) they received exceptionally favour-able treatment, and are therefore suffering relatively rather than absolutely.50. Certain occurrences in this Province call for detailed notice.(a) The Bilaspur Election Enquiry (see paragraph 21 of the last Survey) began on May 9th. A preliminary objection that the Committee had no juris-diction to hear the case against Dr. Raghavendra Rao was upheld and on May .25th proceedings against him were dropped : the reason being that the terms of reference limited the enquiry to allegations against Government servants. The enquiry has since been proceeding in camera against the other defendants.Meanwhile, confusion followed an order of the Government cancelling the appointment of the counsel for the defence on the ground that they were closely connected with the election case. Both the defendants and the Committee pro-tested against this order. It was only after protracted discussions that fresh counsel were appointed. A member of the Committee (a Congress partisan) in the course of his note dissenting from the order discharging Dr. Rao referred to the accused Government servants as &quot; miscreants &quot; : a petition for his removal from the Committee was then presented to the Governor, who rejected it on corning to the conclusion that the use of the offending word was due to a lack of knowledge of the English language.LS196HDMay, when police raided a certain area in the city in order to round up a set of petty thieves and burglars. Congress accused the police of third degree methods, needless coercion and assaults on women.Certain objectionable agitators have been externed from this Province and cases of sedition are dealt with promptly. This action is part of the &quot; repres-sive character of the administration &quot;against which Congress keeps up a conti-nual outcry. On July 22nd the local Congress Committee induced a hartal in the city (practically complete in the Hindu quarters) ; most of the shops closed and the cloth-mills could not open. Sixty-nine persons were arrested, includ-ing the President, Vice-President and Secretary of the Congress Committee.45. About the Andaman Islands and Panth-Piploda there is no further news of interest.
The enquiry is openly criticised as futile : the evidence tendered is believ-: ed to be trivial : and serious allegations about tampering with ballot boxes have been found on investigation to be baseless. The enquiry is costing Rs. 10,000 a month, and there is a growing demand that it should be abandoned. It has now been postponed until the end of the rainy season.(b) In the course of the quarrels between the Ministers, the correspondence which passed between the Premier and his disaffected Mahakoshal colleagues who submitted their resignations in May found its way into the Press. It is not known who committed this breach of confidence : hut, as the letters freely mentioned and criticised the views expressed on various subjects of contro-versy by particular officers, the result has been to create some distrust and prejudice against individuals and some disheartenment generally among the officials of the Province.(c) In each Province an officer of the Central Government (Central Intelli-gence Officer) under the control of the Intelligence Bureau of the Government of India performs duties which include the furtherance of co-operation between provincial Intelligence organisations and the supply to the Centre and to the Governor of information which might otherwise not be supplied under provin-cial autonomy. The necessity for discretion in the exercise of these functions has been recognised and observed : in no Province but the Central Provinces have the Ministers shown disapproval of the arrangement, while in ^some provinces the C. I. 0. has been made welcome by the Ministry. In June the Central Provinces Premier (Khare) asked this officer to enquire into rumours about the dishonesty of Misra, the Minister for Local Self-Government. He had politely to evade the request. In July, Mehta, Finance Minister, prepared a note for the Cabinet demanding information about the constitutional position, functions, etc., of the C. I. O. In the storm raised by the Ministerial conflict the subject has fallen into the background. But it remains to be seen whether the new Ministry, containing both Mehta and Misra, will return to the attack. It is possible that it was inspired, not by knowledge of Khare &apos;s attempt to use the C. I. O. against Misra, but by an unfounded suspicion that the C. I. 0. was responsible for the leakage mentioned in (b) above.51. The Madras Premier has exxoressed publicly his satisfaction with the excellent relations prevailing between the Ministry and the Services, parti-cularly the British members of the I. C. S. He has said : &quot; If you ask me today to remove the whole of the permanent Service and replace it by more capable, experienced and honest people, I tell you it is impossible &quot;. On another occasion he is reported to have remarked of officials : &quot; I rather think they like me &quot;, and there is no reason to suppose the claim unfounded, at any rate as regards the higher ranks. He is especially pleased with the results achieved in the &quot; prohibition &quot; area of Salem under the administration of a British Collector and Superintendent of Police.52. In the North-West Frontier Province the &quot; Red Shirts &quot; still give dis-trict officials trouble by their interference in investigations and so forth. It is said that Ministers show some hostility to lambardars (junior Revenue officials) because they still look to the British officers as their friends in need. One inci-dent in this Province has caused sorne remark : the senior Public Prosecutor Avas summarily dismissed, Avithout any reasons being assigned and without any explanation being demanded from him : the reason appears to be that on an occasion Avhen two of the Ministers Adsited the scene of a murder, the Public Prosecutor commented that their visit had given the case undue importance; As regards the United Provinces, mention is made below of &quot; anti-corruption &quot; activities and of the Rural DeA-development Scheme.There is good reason to beliea^e, from very recent enquiries, that the police organisation of this Province is receiving cordial support from the Ministry. The Premier sIioavs confidence in the officers at the head of it and makes no difficulty about proposals designed to increase its efficiency.53. Some specific matters need particular mention : (i) The clamour against corruption in the Services has been mentioned in preadous Surveys. No fault can be found Avith a genuine desire, prosecuted in a fair and reasonable, manner, to eradicate the corruption which undoubtedly exists in the Government services (as elseAvhere in India). It mlay also be admitted that there is something to be said for the insistence on &quot; seivice &quot; as an ideal in contrast to the emphasis formerly laid on efficiency which, more especially avhen there was organised obstruction to the machinery of government, at times led to some sacrifice of honesty in the maintenance of prestige. The danger is dual--of the drive against corruption being exploited for the Ancti-misation of individuals, and of the adoption of such remedies as aauII fail to provide safeguards against malicious accusations and Avill therefore lead to,
Wlack of that confidence and security which are essential conditions of service. The recommendations of the UP. &quot; anti-corruption &quot; committee,- published in May, are open to criticism as not avoiding these dangers and as being rather a statement of the problem than a useful contribution to its solution. On the other hand, in this Province&quot; the appointment of a police officer to investigate allegations of dishonesty (see paragraph 20 of Survey no. 1) is believed to have had some useful results.Enquiries similar to those of the U. P. committee are proceeding in Bihar and in Orissa.In Madras the Government have published instructions which lay on the senior district officials responsibility for the honesty of their subordinate staff, and which make it clear that disciplinary action is expected even where suspi-cion of dishonesty does not amount to positive proof.(it) The separation of judicial and executive functions has long been a demand of politicians. So far as the demand has been intelligent it has been directed against (a) the subordination of all magistrates in a district to the District Magistrate, which is supposed to induce interference with the free exercise of judicial decision by the subordinate magistracy, (b) the combination in district officers of executive (e.g., revenue) functions and magisterial func-tions, enabling them to import the terror of the law into their extra-magisterial activities, and (c) the vesting in magistrates (instead of judges) of the &quot; pre-preventive &quot; powers provided in the Criminal Procedure Code, leading to the alleged exercise of these poAvers with greater regard to the presentation of order than to the liberty of the subject.Pressure has been brought on Congress Ministries to implement a reform which all advanced politicians have for long ada^ocated. That nothing has hitherto been done is some evidence that the defects of the present arrange-ments are not serious. The Madras Premier has parried the demand by pleading, first, that the change Avould mean much greater expense, and, secondly, that as magistrates are now the subordinates of the Ministry there is less danger of abuse in fact the Premier hinted that he saAV positive advantages in the Ministry retaining in its hands the full machinery for enforcing public order rather than in entrusting it to the passionless control of the High Court.In the United Provinces alone has any step been taken to pursue the matter. There a senior I. C. S. officer has been instructed to examine the practicability of certain proposals. But it is doubtful whether the Ministry are really zealous for change.The subject is mentioned under the &quot; Services &quot; head since the district officer is still the key-stone of the administration and a aa^eakening of his posi-tion must result- in disheartenment of the services on avkom falls the main burden of public order.(iii) &quot; Strain on the Services &quot;. The results of the enquiry made by the Governor-General about the effect on the Services of the introduction of proAin-cial autonomy, mentioned in paragraph 65 of the last Survey, are summarised in the Appendix.The enquiry has raised questions avhich will need careful examination. The time is not ripe for further comment : but, as regards the size of the British element in the Services, it may be worth while to give the figures of British and Indian officers in the I. C. S. actually serving the Governors&apos; Provinces. It is not generally knoAvn how small the total figure is and Iioav far the process of Indianisation has already gone. The number of British officers is 490, and the number of Indian officers 529. These figures include officers employed on judicial duties : the number employed on executive duties aarould be considerably less.(iv) Abolition of Posts In a number of Provinces Committees have been set up to inA^estigate the possibility of retrenchment, and their proposals neces-sarily affect the Services. The Secretary of State&apos;s Services, being the most expensive, arc specially open to attack. In Assam an attempt Avas made, by refusing the funds for the staffs of the &apos;two Divisional Commissioners, to secure the abolition of those posts : and the Government&apos;s proposal to abolish one of them is under consideration. It is understood that the Retrenchment Com-mittee in this Province Avill advocate the abolition of certain senior posts in other departments. In the C. P. the proposal has&quot; been made that two senior posts in the P. &quot;VV. D. shall be abolished : the posts of Financial Commissioner and Divi-sional Commissioners, and Conservator of Forests are also being assailed : and a Board of Revenue to be manned by non-officials on the Congress scale of pay is advocated. From the Madras Ministry a general memorandum has been received demanding the abolition of the civil branch of the I. M. S.
Some Provincial legislatures have by resolution- demanded that recruitment to the Secretary of State&apos;s Services shall cease : and it is likely that further attacks on them will be made. So far as these are endorsed by Ministries it-must not he assumed that evidence is accumulating of deliberate and organised hostility to these Services, or to the British officer as such. Sufficient motive may be found in the high remuneration of these Services (regarded as both exees-sive in itself and as setting an excessively high standard for other Services) and in their reservation, by provisions of the Government of India Act, from, full control by the Provincial Governments.54. Pay and Allotvances. Though Madras is the only Province that, has yet introduced revised scales of pay for the Services under the control of the Provin-cial Government, proposals are germinating elsewhere. Some of these are ambitious : the Bihar Retrenchment Committee is reported to have recommended a reduction in the salaries of the Governor and High Court Judges as well as of&quot; the Provincial Services,55. The attack on special pay and allowances also is developing. In the Central Provinces the proposal has been made to abolish the special pay now attached to certain posts, e.g., those in the Secretariat.The Governor of Bombay has accepted his Government V proposals for reduction in travelling allowance, to take the place of the temporary 10 per cent, cut ; the iiett effect of the cuts is a reduction of about 64 per cent. The Finance Minister fulfilled his promise to consult Services Associations as well as Heads of Departments, and the cuts are not unreasonable.In the middle of June, Mehta, the Finance Minister of the Central Pro-vinces, wrote to the Finance Minister in Bombay, saying that he wished to reduce to the second grade the travelling allowance of all officers under the control of&quot; the Secretary of State drawing less than Rs. 1,000.&quot; He asked for support in case the matter came to a crisis with the Governor ; but assistance from Bombay was refused because the matter had already been settled in that Province. Mehta is understood to have written in the same strain to all Congress Provinces. In Madras and the North-West Frontier Province the subject has not been raised : a suggestion has heen made in Orissa to raise the limit of pay for first grade officers to Rs. 750 ; in the United Provinces it was proposed to abolish all first class travelling allowance, hut the proposal actually under considera-tion is to raise the first grade limit to Rs. 900.The matter has taken definite shape in Bihar : the Ministry&apos;s proposal is one that a pay of Rs. 750 a month should be required to qualify for first-class allowance for railway travel : exception is however made in favour of officers in independent charge of sub-divisions, so that the only officers of Secretary of State&apos;s Services who would he affected are I. C. S. officers up to about 18&apos; months&apos; service and Indian Police officers up to about 3 years&apos; service. The proposal is now under the consideration of the Secretary of State.56. A proposal of the Madras Premier to reduce the salaries of new entrants to the Public Service Commission was mentioned in paragraph 66 of the last Survey. After consulting Governors the Governor-General has advised the Governor of Marb-as as follows :-that it would be difficult to refuse a reason-able reduction provided the right type of person is recruited, that-is to say the new entrant must he one who is not amenable to sinister influences, and must maintain an independent attitude as against Government, so that the danger (to provide against which the Commissions were appointed) may he avoided of an endeavour by Ministers to secure greater control over appointments in order that they may exercise political patronage.(b) Interference with the administration : signs of parallel administration irtthe districts.57. The number, of reported cases of direct interference with the adminis-tration has markedly decreased during the period under review. In paragraph 67 of the last Survey mention was made of a proposal to set up forty-eight Congress centres in one district of the United Provinces for registering crime reports : in fact only one was established. In the North-West Frontier Pro-vince the &apos;&apos; Red Shirts &apos;&apos; have continued to give some trouble &apos;to district officers by interfering in investigations and so on. When a police party was fired at during an attempt to effect an arrest, the &quot; Red Shirts &quot; induced all the villagers to vacate the village so that no evidence was obtainable.Complaints come from various quarters about interference from members of Legislatures ; in the United Provinces a Congress M.L.A. was fined, for a flagrant attempt to bring pressure, on judicial officers.
In general it may be said that as there is an improvement in relations between the Services and the Congress public, so the latter are less inclined to interfere in the Services&apos; business. No doubt they are also losing the desire to show their new-found power which followed the acceptance of office by Congress.58. Rural Development Schemes. Here again the menace presented by the original scheme formulated by the United Provinces Government has largely disappeared (see paragraph 51 of Survey no. 3). On May 2nd a Forest Officer was appointed Rural Development Officer in place of the egregious Mr. Paliwal, and the department is being reorganised. There will be a Provincial Rural Development Board under the chairmanship, of the Minister of Justice, with the Rural Development Officer as Secretary and other official and non-official raeni-bers. This Board&apos;s functions will be mainly advisory. In each district there will be a Rural Development Association, consisting largely of non-officials but including officials of the departments concerned with Rural Development and two nominees of the District Officer, one of whom will be the Secretary. The Asso-ciatidns will decide policy and direct operations and will be in charge of finance ; but the executive powers are given to smaller committees which will supervise the expenditure on, and execution of, schemes adopted by the Associations. The Secretaries of the Associations will also be the Secretaries of the executive com-mittees.The scheme still has doubtful features, such as the appointment of politicians as Divisional Superintendents (corresponding to the official Divisional Commis-sioners) : but the attempt to dissociate all officials from it has ended, and official co-operation is in fact explicitly sought. The scheme, ambitious on paper, has yet to prove its value in practice.The Bihar scheme for rural development is understood to have be,en worked out, but details have not yet been published.59. Local Self-Government Reform. Nothing more has been heard of cither the U. P. Committee&apos;s proposals or Misra&apos;s scheme in the Central Provin-ces, both of which were mentioned in paragraph 69 of the last Survey.60. The Volunteer Movement. Reference was made in paragraph 70 of the last Survey to proposals for the formation of volunteer police corps in Bombay and the Central Provinces. Neither scheme has made any progress ; but deve-lopments in various parts of India call for mention. It is difficult to relate them to any concerted policy, and they may be regarded rather as a legacy of the days when any unemployed youngster could be enrolled as a Congress soldier for whatever trouble was afoot. Congress leaders still talk of a national organisa-tion : in February last Subhas Bose advocated a national volunteer corps in his presidential address at the all-India Congress session, claiming that a well-disciplined corps with a cadre of trained officers was essential to direct the energy and enthusiasm called forth by Congress. The communal riots in March elicited from Gandhi a proposal to form an all-India &quot; peace army &quot; of Congress volunteers for the ostensible purpose of quelling communal riots and other forms of mass violence. Pursuing the idea in June, he spoke of this body as intended to &quot; substitute the police and even the Army &quot;.In Assam and Bengal Subhas Bose has put into practice a scheme for paid organisers to carry on the &quot; mass contact &quot; movement. Volunteer training camps of a socialist complexion have been organised on a small scale by the Kerala Congress Committee in Madras Presidency ; the organisation of volun-teers is proceeding in Bombay and the United Provinces. The Bihar Assembly passed a resolution recommending a trained volunteer corps as a reserve force for emergencies, with provision for military training and a special military school.A notable feature of the volunteer revival is the wearing of uniforms and the attention paid to semi-military drill. While Gandhi intends his &quot; peace brigade to be wedded to non-violence, Nehru and Bose seem to have different ideas ; Nehru has explained the need for a corps to safeguard the country from the attacks of European powers, and Bose has hopes of a volunteer corps acting-as an instrument of parallel Government to oppose British Imperialism in the coming struggle.Large formations of Muslim volunteers also exist, and the fashion is spread-ing to the Kisans and landowners, who, in an effort to protect their interests, are urging, the formation of similar volunteer corps.The ideas behind all these enterprises are still nebulous, and (in the Congress) lacking in singleness of aim : and tb.8 attempts to carry them out are still sporadic and fitfulils196hd
(c) Parliamentary Secretaries-.61. The stains of Parliamentary Secretaries and the&apos; scope&quot; of their duties were among the subjects discussed at the conference of Congress Premiers held in Bombay in May (see paragraph 110). It was reported then in the press that the conference had agreed that the sphere of Parliamentary Secretaries&apos; work was purely&apos;Parliamentary and not administrative, but this news appears to have been incorrect. Each Province has been allowed a free hand to tackle the sub-ject in its own way. While the Madras and Bombay Ministries are reluctant to give&apos; their Parliamentary Secretaries much executive scope, those in Bihar and the United Provinces adopt a freer&apos; line.In Bihar Parliamentary Secretaries have always- had a wider sphere of action than elsewhere ; for example, two of them: did useful work iri connection with labour disputes and their behaviour in relation to the district officials was-unexceptionable. A recent proposal which is open to objection is that a Parlia-mentary Secretary should he authorised to inspect police stations, jails, etc., but this has not yet been pressed.The Bengal Premier is considering the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary hut has not yet-made up his mind about it. Th/e Premier of the North-West Frontier Province is anxious to appoint four, hut has so far been unable-to select them for fear of offending the numerous other candidates. He intends them to deal with Parliamentary work and to dispose of petitions and applica-tions, but to allot them no executive duties or responsibilities and not reven to allow them to see official files.The views of&quot; the United Provinces Government on this subject are ad-advanced. When Parliamentary Secretaries, were first appointed it was decided that they would, help Ministers in administrative and legislative matters, but would not be interposed between a permanent Secretary and a Minister, andi could not dispose of files. These instructions were not followed strictly, andi there had been a growing tendency for Ministers to use their Parliamentary Secretaries to advise them on files, and in some cases they have, even tried to pass orders on files- a habit quickly checked.Early in May both the Ministers and the Parliamentary Secretaries pressed for more definite functions to be allotted- to the latter, who professed to be most dissatisfied with their position and were inclined to resign in protest. The Premier therefore proposed that all files should ordinarily be sent to Parliamentary Secre-taries, who should dispose of all routine or unimportant cases, and discuss important cases verbally with Ministers before passing orders, or refer them to Ministers after noting. The Premier maintained that this system would relieve Ministers of - a lot of work ; he was ready to agree that any attempt on the part of Parliamen-tary Secretaries to impair the authority of the permanent Secretaries must be prevented. In consultation with the Governor-General and the Secretary of State it was decided to permit an arrangement whereby files should go from permanent Secretaries to Ministers, and Ministers should decide how far they wished to have the assistance of their Parliamentary Secretaries : the latter should see no confidential files and should not be permitted to note on certain specified classes of cases : their notes would of course be only advisory and they should pass no orders. This arrangement was not to be given formal authority by rule framed under section 59 of the Government of India Act.In the middle of June the Premier produced a draft order defining the func-tions of Parliamentary Secretaries. It was of intention worded somewhat vaguely, because the Ministry preferred to have no more precise instructions issued. The two clauses of the order are (1) that Parliamentary Secretaries shall assist Ministers in their Parliamentary work and represent them in the Legislature when necessary, and (2) that Ministers may entrust to them &quot; such administrative work as they deem fit &quot;, though as a rule final orders shall be passed by Ministers. Before this order is published it is intended to get the details more clearly defined. The nn-portance of ensuring-that confidential papers do not fall into the hands of persons who have not taken the oath of secrecy is recognised.(d) Attitude of Ministries to law and order: reporting of speeches : &quot; repressive&quot; legislation and restrictions, etc.62. The policy of the non-Congress Provincial Governments remains un-changed ; all these four Provinces have been free from serious disorders-though there have been troublesome disturbances in the Punjab recently in connection
with agrarian grievances. The policy of the Bengal Government regarding the release of terrorist prisoners and detenus is described inparagraph 75. In the Punjab the Shahidganj agitation has subsided (see paragraph 108). The Ministry&apos;s pro-posed legislation to suppress the publication of communal articles in the press is discussed in paragraph 107. Neither the Bengal nor the Punjab Government hesitates to use powers of externment against undesirable persons, and a number of released &quot; political &quot; prisoners have been ejected from their borders ; the Punjab Government served, externment orders on the three Madras prisoners, who were released in July, as soon as they emerged from jail (see paragraph 78).63. The conviction of the editor and printer of a newspaper for sedition for an attack on the Bengal Ministry was mentioned in paragraph 73 of the last Survey. The accused were acquitted on appeal by the High Court. One ground of acquittal is of importance asaninterpretation of section 124A of the Indian Penal Code in the light of the new constitution : the Court, after referring to sections 49 and 50 of the Government of India Act, held that there is no specific provision of that Act which vests executive functions in the Ministry : such functions are vested in the Governor and in officers subordinate to him : therefore, in view of the terms of section 17 of the Indian Penal Code; an. attack on the Ministry could scarcely be brought within the mischief of the sedition section.The manager of another notorious newspaper was prosecuted and convicted for sedition in May and sentenced to four months&apos; imprisonment and fine.64. Congress Ministries continue to show a greater willingness to use the weapons which their predecessors have found the most effective for the prevention and suppression of disorder.65. Bihar. The Ministry have to be prepared for both agrarian and labour trouble. In one likely centre of agrarian disorder they have posted a small force of military police.66. Bombay. Munshi, the Home Minister, has had reason to be. relieved that his proposal to repeal the Press (Emergency Powers) Act was not accepted  (see paragraph 77 of the last Survey). He has since employed it to suppress the incitement of communal hatred (see paragraph 107). He has drafted an Ordi-nance to take the place of the Bombay Special (Emergency) Powers Act which was repealed in April : the provisions are not dissimilar to those of the Act itself. The Government have had very little disorder to deal With ; they acted quickly in suppressing the small labour disturbances in Bclgaum.(see paragraph 100).67. Central Provinces. Early in May the Premier warned two persons for making speeches advocating violence. The Government has ordered that speeches made by communal agitators should be fully reported.68. Madras. In paragraph 79 of the last Survey the Chirala labour riot was mentioned. In May the Government ordered all prosecutions in connection with the riot to be withdrawn, expressing the opinion that the &quot; unfortunate incident &quot; should be finally closed. Nevertheless during his recent tour of the area the Premier has been attacked for his acceptance of the finding that the firing at Chirala was justified. His determined repression of the anti-Hindi agitation is described in paragraph 27.69. North-West Frontier Province. The Governor has refused his assent to the private Bill Avhich repealed section 124A of the Indian Penal Code and other provisions of law, referred to in paragraph 80 of the last Survey. Some sections of the Press expected a Ministerial crisis to result from this, the first use of a Governors powers to refuse assent, but the Ministry is unperturbed, and it does not appear that the incident will be exploited.As a result of a number of bomb outrages in Bannu city, the Premier agreed to the cancellation of all arms licenses held by residents of the city.The tone of public speeches in this Province has been deteriorating : both the Congress and the Muslim League speakers show an increasing tendency to attack the British, though their motive is probably party propaganda. Since the beginning of the year about a dozen cases have been referred by district officers to the Government for prosecution under section 124A (sedition). The Premier has opposed every recommendation, on the ground that the speeches have attract-ed little attention : he says that he personally warns every offender : and the general effect of the speeches has not yet been damaging. He has agreed that direct incitement to violence or racial hatred must be dealt with under the law, but he prefers to use the &quot; security &quot; section 108 of the Criminal Procedure Code rather than prosecute under section 124A of the Indian Penal Code,
70. United Provinces. The Government has not been troubled by open agrarian, communal, or labour disturbances, though there has heen danger of all three. The steps taken to ensure order in Cawnpore during the general strike are described in paragraph 105. In May, a virulent revolutionary leaflet came to light; the police asked for authority to prosecute any one disseminating it; the. Premier agreed that copies should be seized, but it was found that the pamphlet Avas in fact not being distributed.In paragraph 57 of Survey no. 2, the activities of Parmanand, a released revolutionary convict from the Punjab, were described. It will be remembered that he just escaped a prosecution for sedition in December last. Recently he has directly incited his audiences to violence, and the police have on several occasions recommended prosecution. The Premier is reluctant to. take action, in spite of his having issued a communique in January to the effect that for such speeches prosecutions would be instituted without further warning. He contends that Parmanand is a spent force and a prosecution will only give him undesirable publicity. The Government contemplate the issue of instructions requiring magistrates to use every endeavour in the suppression of agrarian disorder, whether the provocation comes from zamindars or from tenants : speeches are to he reported, the preventive sections of the Criminal Procedure Code are to be employed, and arms licenses are to be cancelled, where district magistrates consider these steps necessary.71. Reporting of speeches. There have been no new developments in any Province except those mentioned above in the Central Provinces and United Provinces.72. Tear-gas. In the Punjab tear-gas squads were ready for action in the agrarian disturbances in Amritsar in July but were not actually employed. There is nothing further to report.73. Honorary Magistrates.- In the Central Provinces it has now been decided to invest selected Presidents and Vice-Presidents of local bodies with powers as &quot; special magistrates &quot;, to take the place of the Honorary Magistrates who were weeded out (see paragraph 11 of Survey no. 2). Even this device is unlikely to dispose of the enormous arrears of petty criminal cases which have been piling up, but the Congress party in this Province is set against the system of Honorary Magistrates.In the United Provinces, where the Ministry dismissed all Honorary Magis-trates (see paragraph 15 of Survey no. 2), committees have been set up, including the district judge and district magistrate and various non-of eials, to select new men to take their place. In some cases former Honorary Magistrates have been re-appointed.(e) &quot; Political &quot; Prisoners and Detenus.74. The problem of the release of &quot; political &quot; prisoners is now practically confined to the two non-Congress Provinces of Bengal and the Punjab. During the last three months the few remaining prisoners in Congress Provinces have been released and it is believed that none are now in jail unless the Chauri Chaura convicts of the United Provinces, mentioned below, are considered to be &quot; politi-cal&quot;. There is nothing to say of Assam, the Central Provinces, the North-West Frontier Province or Orissa ; the developments in other Provinces will be des-cribed.75. Bengal. At the beginning of May the Cabinet considered the discussions between Gandhi and the Home Minister (see paragraph 89 of the last Survey) and decided their policy regarding the release of prisoners and detenus. An offer was made to Gandhi as follows : Terrorist convicts suffering from severe illness, and those with only six months or less to serve, should be released at once; those with more than six and less than eighteen months to serve should be released with-in three months, excepting those who were convicted of offences involving murder; or serious violence; all -other cases should be placed before an advisory committee who would examine each case on its merits and make recommendations to Govern-nient, Governments decision to be final. The advisory committee should consist of nine members a retired judicial officer of high standing as president, six members of the Legislatures, including two Congressmen, one official and one more non-official.
As an integral part of the scheme, Gandhi and the Congress must see that no attempt should be made to improve on the terms offered, that all agitation should cease, and that hunger-strikes should be firmly discouraged. It was emphasised that unless the whole scheme were accepted as it stood, the Government would consider themselves free to proceed with their previous policy. It was added that if the agreed solution were reached, the Congress would not have reason to be dissatisfied with the action that Government would take regarding State prison-ers and detenus.These proposals were communicated to Gandhi on May 11th. At the end of the period under review they were still the subject of correspondence and dis-cussion. Gandhi at first suggested that he should be allowed to discuss the proposals with the convicts themselves. The Government&apos;s refusal to agree to this stiffened Gandhi&apos;s attitude and by the middle of June he was expressing doubts as to the value of the scheme. At the end of June Gandhi, pleading ill-health, asked if the Home Minister would discuss the subject with Subhas Bose ; Nazimuddin agreed and consultations have taken place, but after nearly three months&apos; discussion no decision had been made.At the beginning of July Nazimuddin obtained the approval of the Cabinet and the Governor to a scheme of accelerated releases of State prisoners and detenus, whereby all of them, numbering about 300, will be freed from restraint by the end of August 1938. The release of all these gentry more than 2,000 will have been released since August, 1937 is of course a risk : but those released hitherto have not revived terrorism, though-many of them have turned towards agitation of various kinds, more particularly along with the extreme left of the tenants&apos; movement: and the graver risk is that of a hunger-strike and the hysteria which would accompany it. With all the detenus out of the way, the hands of the Government would be free to deal with a hunger-strike among the convicts.76. Bihar.-Although all the prisoners originally considered &quot; political &quot; had been released, the Premier discovered three more whose cases were hard to distinguish from those who had been set free. The Governor agreed to their release on the usual undertaking being given to abjure violence.77. Bombay. At the end of June the Governor agreed to the release of the last &quot; political &quot; prisoner in the Presidency.78. Madras. Early in June the Government put forward a proposal to release four prisoners (the last for whom they were responsible) convicted in 1933 for violent offences in the Presidency but serving their sentences in the Punjab and the United Provinces. They are natives of those Provinces, and the Punjab and the U. P. had taken them over to oblige the Madras Government. Efforts were made to persuade the Premier to agree to the release being conditional on abstention from violence and a promise not to enter the Provinces in which they were confined during the remainder of their sentences. The Premier refused to obtain any undertakings ; he was satisfied that the prisoners had given up violent methods, and it was for the Governments concerned to keep them out of their Provinces by externment orders if they so desired. When persuasion failed to move the Premier, the Governor eventually assented to the releases ; the issue would not have justified the creation of a crisis. The three Punjabi convicts were externed from the Punjab as soon as they were released.Meanwhile the Premier is creating a new type of &quot; political &quot; prisoner by his repression of the anti-Hindi agitation (see paragraph 27).79. Punjab. The subject of releases in this Province has attracted practi-cally no attention.   About twenty prisoners have been set free at intervals.An interesting story attaches to the surrender of one Prithvi Singh. This man was a particularly dangerous terrorist ; he was convicted in the first Lahore Conspiracy case in 1915, twice escaped from custody after his conviction, and had been at large since 1922. In the middle of May he presented himself to Gandhi in Bombay and on GandhPs advice surrendered to the law. It is believed that Prithvi Singh knew that he could not much longer evade capture ; and by his surrender to Gandhi he probably hoped to obtain his own release and also that of one Gurmukh Singh, an old associate of his in desperate terrorist crime. Gandhi then wrote to the Governor General asking him to procure the release of Prithvi Singh, whom he represented as an idealist who had spent his years of hiding in studying and inculcating the science of physical culture, and as a convert from belief in armed revolution.   Gandhi therefore wished to keep him by his side and &quot; engagems19ghd
him in constructive national activity&quot;. This view of Prithvi Singh&apos;s career-since 1922 did not square with what was known to the police of his activities in Russia and India activities which rendered a sudden and complete conversion to non-violence almost incredible. The Governor-General replied to Gandhi that in view of his record he could not recommend his release to the Punjab Govern-ment.   Prithvi Singh has since been returned to jail in the Punjab.80. Sind. Hans Raj &quot; Wireless &quot;, mentioned in paragraph 89 of the last Survey, was released on May 5th. He gave an undertaking to remain in Sind during the unexpired portion of his sentence, about 2-J years, and on being released communicated to his friends and relatives that he had abandoned all idea of violence and was dedicating his life to his country as a soldier of the Congress.81. United Provinces. Late in June, two of the Ministers suggested the release of the prisoners convicted in the &quot; Chauri Chaura &quot; case of 1922 and still serving their sentences. In that outrage thirteen policemen were murdered in cireum-stances which at the time caused general horror and induced Gandhi to abandon his agitation against Government. When the demand for releases Was at its height in January and February, these cases were not pressed. When the recent proposal came up, the Governor suggested releasing at first only two of the oldest men whose records are not particularly bad, while the other cases are to be considered ; on July 27th two of the prisoners were released. In July the Ministry also proposed to release about ten prisoners convicted for complicity in a civil disobedience riot case known as the Gulaothi riot in which a policeman was murdered and a number of rioters shot. The sentences were at the time considered to be very heavy and the Governor has agreed that they shall be reduced from 10 years to 8 .(f) The Agrarian Situation.82. The collection of land revenue and rent as an index of agrarian conditions was mentioned in the last Survey (paragraph 90). The latest position may be summarised as follows : -In Assam collections of revenue have been rather unsatisfactory ; liberal re-missions and concessions granted by Government encouraged slackness, and in certain areas there is said to be a belief that revenne collection is no longer consi-dered to be of importance. In Bengal there have been occasional indications of a &quot; no-rent &quot; campaign ; there is a tendency for tenants to feel that payment of rent can be avoided, and they have acquired an exaggerated idea of their own importance from the approaches made to them from all sides and from the promises of rent-reduction held out to them by agitators. The landowners cannot however be absolved from responsibility, as many of them seldom visit their holdings and make no attempt to prevent extortion by their agents. The situation in the Punjab is satisfactory. In Sind the only trouble likely to arise is in connection with the Barrage area assessment (see paragraph 34).83. So much for the non-Congress Provinces. In Bihar, as a result of the subversive Kisan agitation, landlords have experienced considerable difficulty in re-covering rents and no fewer than 169 estates defaulted at the last revenue payment. In the Central Provinces land revenue came in very slowly, and Government loans were hard to recover ; landowners have complained of the difficulty in recovering rents. Bombay and Madras have experienced no trouble. In the North-West Frontier Province the biggest landowners are for the most part Muslims in strong opposition to the Congress Government ; tenants, possibly encouraged by Congress or.&quot; Red Shirt &quot; workers, and partly influenced by a false impression about the provisions of the forthcoming Agriculturists&apos; Relief Bill, have been withholding rents ; 60 per cent, of the land revenue in Peshawar district for the last winter crop was still outstanding at the end of June. In Orissa, intensified Kisan agitation has been responsible for a &quot; no-rent &quot; mentality ; it is also said that some of the primitive peoples have been induced to enlist as Congress members on the under-standing that membership will ensure relief from taxation. Government had to issue a press note in May warning tenants that no reduction could be claimed except under the provisions of the agrarian legislation to be passed, and at the end of June the Premier announced that if tenants did not pay up he would be compelled to give landowners police assistance to make distraints. In the United Pro-vinces the revenue position is not unsatisfactory, but Government again had to issue a Press communique in June, advising tenants to pay rents if they wanted to benefit by the proposed legislation.
134. Relations between landowners and tenants are unsatisfactory in several Provinces, though there have been only a few instances of actual disorder a few murders, in Bihar and the United Provinces, and a number of clashes in Bihar and the North-West Frontier Province. The breach between the Kisans and the orthodox Congress party (referred to in paragraph 71 of Survey no. 2) has widened. On May 13th Swami Sahajanand, the Kisan leader, presiding over a conference of the All-India Kisan Sabha at Comilla in Bengal, criticised the failure of Congress to protect Kisan interests and justified the separate existence of the Kisan organi-sation. The conference at Comilla was a failure : there were never more than 1,000 genuine Kisans present. Nevertheless, the conference served to embitter still further the relations between landowners and tenants. Since that date, Sahajanand has resumed extreme agitation in Bihar ; he has told his Kisan audiences that they have reached the same stage as the peasants of Russia on the eve of the revolution ; that they must depend on their own personal strength and be prepar-ed to die for their fields ; and, while avoiding any direct incitement to violence, he has followed the line of accustoming his audiences to the idea that violence is inevitable in the end. Released &quot; political &quot; prisoners have been taking a prominent part in the agitation ; and in parts of the Province the movement appears to have gone beyond the control of the orthodox Congress party. In June a small force of military police had to be posted in one village to prevent disorder.In the United Provinces relations between tenants and landowners have been unsettled by the pendency of legislation. The Tenancy Bill (see paragraph 87) has been an almost constant subject of discussion. At a conference of landowners held on May 29th, after strongly worded speeches by the leading landowners of the Province, a resolution was adopted condemning the total failure of the Govern-ment to protect the lawful rights of landowners, proposing to set up a volunteer corps with their own flag, and declaring their intention of organising civil dis-obedience and filling the jails, if necessary, in defence of their rights, (Jawaharlal Nehru retorted with a statement contemptuously dismissing the landlords&apos; pro-nouncements as signs of hysteria.) Of the 150 Congress members in the two Houses of the Legislature, 60 are landowners, and the nature of the proposals makes severe demands on their party loyalty.85. Separate mention must be made of the agrarian unrest In the Punjab. It appears that some months ago in the Amritsar district the Akali party, jealous -of the power wielded by the Kisan committees, decided to organise committees of their own to agitate in the rural areas. During June, Government proposals Tor a new settlement of this area and Governments scheme for remodelling the irrigation canal outlets in the same district were both represented by these committees as a souree of grievance to the peasants. Agitation was intensified, and the rival committees joined hands and decided to hold demonstrations against the proposals. The first demonstration was due to take place at Amritsar on July 20th, and in anticipation of disorder the district magistrate prohibited all demonstrations in certain areas under section 144, Criminal Procedure Uode. The committees decided to defy this order and parties of agitators were first ordered to move to the famous Jallianwala Bagh (outside the prohibited area) where a meeting was held on the 20th, which attracted 7,000 people. From there a party moved towards the prohibited area, was stopped by the police and dis-persed ; a number of injuries were caused. A &quot; War Council &quot; met on the same day and decided to despatch daily parties of 25 persons to defy the prohibitory order. every   day the leaders were arrested : the agitation had not ceased at the end of July.86. Legislation. The progress of agrarian legislation, some of which was referred to in para. 93 of the last Survey, will now be described.87. Bengal. The Tenancy Amendment Bill which was passed in April has been under the consideration of the Governor and has not yet become law. The question of reserving it for the assent of the Governor-General has not been easy to decide i the present position is that two amendments have been suggested which will involve reconsideration by the Legislature ; if they are accepted the Governors assent will automatically follow. The Bill was returned to the Legislature on July 29th.In the meantime a situation arose which led to the issue of the first Governors Ordinance,, under section 88 of the AcL since the introduction of Provincial Autonomy.
The Ministry inserted a clasue in the Bill to the effect that its provisions should come into force by May 31st. A little foresight would have prevented this, because&apos; this complicated measure could not receive the Governors assent by that date; The existing Tenancy Act provides that every transfer of land shall be registered and every instrument or registration shall have a transfer fee paid on it. The Bill abolishes this transfer fee. The purpose of the Ordinance was to extend the time laid down in the Registration Act within which such transfer deeds are required&apos; to be presented for registration ; in other words, the Ordinance had the effect of giving purchasers the option of completing transactions under the old law or&apos; else waiting for the provisions of the new Bill, thereby in anticipation giving re-trospective effect to certain provisions of the Bill.The Ordinance required the sanction of the Governor-General under section 88 (1) (6) of the Act. It was felt that there were objections to helping the Ministers out of a difficulty of their own making by the issue of an Ordinance ; but the Ministers accepted their responsibility for the situation, agreed to the immediate withdrawal of the Ordinance in case assent to the Bill were refused, and undertook, to point out in an explanatory statement that, had the Legislature foreseen that the-Bill could not become law by May 31st, it could have passed a separate Bill making provisions similar to that made by the Ordinance. In these circumstances the Governor-General gave his assent, and the Ordinance was promulgated at the beginning of June.The provision of the Bill most obnoxious to landlords is that which abolishes the right to charge a fee on transfer of tenancy and to refuse recognition of such transfer. Other grievances are the abolition of summary procedure for the recovery of rents and the suspension for 10 years of the power to enhance rents.A happy solution to the problem of this Bill will greatly ease things for the Bengal Ministry. By no means all the landowners are against it; and in the event of assent to the Bill being refused the Ministry would have either to resign or face a heavy defeat in the Assembly. The reform of the Bengal land laws was one of the main points in the election programme of the Muslim Ministers, and if the Bill fails a large number of tenants will be thrown into the arms of Congress which would probably result in much more drastic legislation being passed by a left-wing Government. The Premier has announced his intention of resigning if the Bill does not become law.88. Bihar. The Agricultural Income Tax Bill was passed by the Assembly on May 3rd, Government having agreed to an important- amendment whereby all Muslim religious endowments are exempted. The rates of taxation on the bigger incomes were also reduced. The Act is expected to produce some 15-^20: lakhs, mostly contributed by about two dozen landowners. The Council also passed the Bill. A Moneylenders&apos; Bill passed through both Houses. Considera-tion of the Restoration of Bakasht Lands Bill and of a new Tenancy Amendment Bill was taken up on June 24th but was postponed indefinitely when landowners protested that the Bills were not in accord with agreed terms ; they threatened, to take no part in the proceedings unless special provision for speedy realisation of rent were included. Early in July agreement was reached on the points in. dispute, largely through the intervention of a member of the Working Committee. The Assembly took up consideration of this legislation again on July 25th and had not disposed of it by the end of the month.89. Bombay. A Moneylenders&apos; Bill was referred to Select Committee some time ago, but pressure was brought to bear on the Ministry and nothing more has been heard of it. The Revenue Minister has no less than six agrarian Bills under preparation for the next session a Tenancy Bill; a, Debt Relief Bill which provides for writing off 40 per cent, of agricultural debts and reducing the other 60 per cent, to moderate proportions ; a Bill to appoint a Revenue Tribunal; a Revenue Settlement Bill, ah Agricultural Income Tax Bill, and a Bill to amend the land revenue code. Some of the proposed legislation has evoked vigorous opposi-tion from the landowners. Their influence with the Ministry is probably strong enough to ensure that the measures passed in this Province will be moderate.90. Central Provinces. The Revision of Land Revenue of Estates Bill which was passed at the end of March and to which reference was made in para. 93 of the last Survey has heen reserved by the Governor for the assent of the Governor-General.
91. Madras. The Agriculturists&apos; Relief Act is said to have relieved to some -extent the burden of debt, but agriculturists feel that their credit has been badly impaired. This inevitable effect of legislation interfering with the relations of creditor and debtor has been felt in other Provinces also.- 92. North-West Frontier Province. There has been increasing agitation against the Agricultural Indebtedness Bill which was circulated for opinion in March. The Bill being aimed at creditors,&apos; who are mostly Hindus, has excited agitation on communal lines : and threatens to alienate Hindu Congress support of the Ministry.The &quot; Teri Dues &quot; Bill passed in this Province presented the unusual feature of being directed against an individual landholder, who under a Regulation of 1902 is entitled to levy various dues. The Bill as passed was considered to offend against the intention of section 299 of the Government of India Act, and has &quot;been returned by the Governor to the Assembly for reconsideration : of the three items of revenue which the Bill proposes to abolish, one is considered to be such that its abolition would be an unconscionable expropriation. The Ministry have agreed to support the amendment recommended by the Governor.93. Orissa. On May 3rd the Assembly passed the Tenancy Amendment Bill, the main provisions of which are to abolish the rights of landlords to levy fees on transfers of tenancy and to refuse consent to such transfers (compare the Bengal Tenancy Bill), and to confer on tenants the property in trees on the land except where these have been specifically found to be the property of the landlord ; and the Small Holders&apos; Relief Bill which grants a moratorium of one year to agri-cultural debtors. The Madras Estates Land (Orissa Amendment) Bill has still not become law, having been reserved by the Governor for the Governor-Generals assent as possibly offending against the intention of section 299 of the Govern-ment of India Act. The Revenue Minister, Kanungo, has announced that he will resign if assent, is refused. A Debt Relief Bill and an Agricultural Income Tax Bill are said to be under preparation.94. Punjab. The Ministry have embarked on an ambitious programme of agrarian legislation for the benefit of the cultivator. This in the main is pre-judicial to the interests of the bania (moneylender) class, which includes most of the Congress members of the Assembly. A Moneylenders&apos; Registration Bill will enforce the compulsory registration of moneylenders ; a Restitution of Mortgaged Lands Bill is designed to liquidate on favourable terms all mortgages executed before 1901, i.e:, those executed for an indefinite term before the provisions of the Land Alienation Act put a limit of 20 years to agricultural mortgages. A third Bill seeks to amend the Land Alienation Act, and a fourth is a Debtors&apos; Protec-tion Amendment Bill. In order to counter the argument that the Moneylenders&apos; Registration Bill affected only non-agriculturists, the Premier also introduced another Bill- the Alienation of Land (third amendment) Bill-to place agricul-turist moneylenders on the same footing as non-agriculturists. All these Bills were passed by the Assembly in July, though they have not yet received the Governors assent.There has been considerable vocal opposition to these &quot; black Bills &quot; from the bania classes in the Punjab. These classes are the main support of Congress in the Province : but downright opposition to the Bills has been forbidden by the Congress High Command since they are designed to benefit the peasantry and are similar to legislation passed or introduced by Congress Ministries. This order has placed the Congress legislators in a difficulty, since obedience means disloyal-ty to their constituents. The two principal Congressmen of the Province the leader of the party in the Assembly and the President of the Provincial Congress Committee are said to have tendered their resignations in protest.95. United Provinces. The elaborate and highly contentious Tenancy Bill has not yet emerged from Select Committee. The agitation against it has been mentioned in para. 84 above.(g) Communism.      ,96. Presumably in accordance with their new declaration of policy mentioned in para. 94 of the last Survey, Communists have been unusually quiet and unob-trusive during the quarter. Labour unrest has been widespread : in Cawnpore Communists undoubtedly took a hand in the labour dispute (see para. 105) but with little effect in inciting disorder. There the Employers&apos; Association demanded an assurance from the Government that active steps would be takenju3196hd
to check the spread of Communist propaganda among workers. The Govern-ment replied that Communism, however much one may dislike it, cannot be sup-pressed by coercion alone and pointed out that there is no ban on the party in &quot; civilised States such as the United Kingdom &quot;. This statement should, however, not be construed as showing a desire on the part of Congress officialdom for the removal of the ban on the Communist Party of India- of which there is still no evidence.That Communists are not idle is shown by the extension of their influence to Orissa, where till recently extremist - politics were little known. A selected Communist leader was sent there on a propaganda tour and a branch of the Communist party has been opened. The agrarian agitation offers a field for activity.The Communists are still no nearer a merger with the Congress Socialists, some of whom have indicated that there can be no such unity until the Communists cut adrift from the Comintern. Lack of leadership, jealousies and group rivalries still stand in the way of a combination between the two organisations, whose out-look is really much the same. The supply of Communist funds from Moscow and other foreign countries having ceased, the party in India has been reduced to little more than a group of self-seeking adventurers who rely on disturbances for their livelihood.&quot; Summer schools &quot; are opened for the inculcation of extreme Socialism and Communism. The most notable of these has been at Sonepur in Bihar : the gate-way was named after a terrorist murderer and the courtyard after a revolutionary. Lectures were communistic in tone and openly advocated violence and direct action as the means to achieve freedom. Secret reports refer to an underground group formed to attract ex-terrorists into the Congress Socialist party, and a number of revolutionaries assembled at Sonepur in circumstances suggesting that they hope to convert that party into a terrorist organisation.(h) The Labour Situation.97. Four Provinces have been affected by serious labour unrest during the-period under review, while in two others there have been disputes which though shortlived reflect the disturbed condition of labour. Bombay Presidency, where labour has for some time been in a state of excitement, has been almost free of trouble ; the Labour Union is adopting constitutional Trade Union methods, with a view to securing recognition under the Trade Disputes Bill which is. soon to be introduced in the Legislature and which was mentioned in paragraph 96 of the last Survey. The Congress party also aspires to control labour in Bombay city and the next development may well be a clash between it and the more extreme organisation. Labour unrest has for the time being shifted to the centre and north of India.98. Bengal. Calcutta has been quiet, but early in June trouble started among the workers in the iron and steel industry at Kulti and Hirapur, which are situated on the western border of Bengal Presidency, adjoining Bihar. The origin of the disputes was the dismissal of nine workers at Hirapur ; the workers demanded their re-instatement and also a 25 per cent, increase in wages, which the management refused. On June 6th 10,000 men at Kulti and 4,000 at Hirapur began a strike, which lasted until July 21st when the parties agreed to the appoint-ment by Government of a conciliation board. The works opened on July 21st: the dismissed men were taken back pending the board&apos;s adjudication.99. Bihar. Following a dispute in the Tin Plate Works at Jamshedpur, workers deliberately slowed down production to one eighth of the normal, and on May 2nd the management closed the works and rendered 3,000 men idle. At the Cable Company Works there had been unrest for some time resulting from the dismissal of some employees, and on May 6th a strike was declared and the factory closed down. At thesCopper Works in Musaboni a strike began on April 20th. There was a dispute at the large Tata Iron and Steel Company&apos;s works at Jamshedpur, and in the middle of June yet another short strike occurred at the Hume Pipe Company, also in Janlshedpur.The dispute at the Tata Company&apos;s works was settled in time to avoid a strike, on the intervention of Subhas Bose, the Congress President. The Company gave a number of concessions, and are said to have paid Bose (or Congress funds under &quot;his control) a handsome reward for bringing about a settlement.   Bose&apos;s endeavours
may have been influenced by the appointment of a relative of bis to a well-paid post in Tata&apos;s.Though the details of the history of the other disputes are obscure, two ele-ments have aggravated the position. First, workers have been showing a tendency to violence: at the Tin Plate Works a murder was committed early in June. Extra police were posted at Musaboni where restrictive orders also had to be issued. Secondly, the chances of settlement have been lessened by the activities of one Abdul Bari, a labour-leader who is also Deputy Speaker of the Bihar Legislative Assembly. As a Congress Muslim he is of some value to the Congress Ministry, but his inflammatory utterances frequently included abuse of the Ministry he professed to represent ; also he was in conflict with a rival labour-leader by the name of Homi. As a result of Bari&apos;s violent attitude the management of all the firms concerned refused to have any dealings with him as the workers&apos; mouthpiece. Bari was humiliated by Bose&apos;s interference in the Tata dispute, and his agitation became so inflammatory that towards the end of June the Premier had personally to re-buke him.Nevertheless, in the second week of July the employers and Abdul Bari as the representative of the workers agreed that Government should appoint concilia-tion boards to investigate the disputes at the Tinplate Company Works and at the Indian Copper Works at Musaboni. Pending the enquiry the men have returned to work. About the same time a new strike began at three collieries in Jealgora ; :2,000 men are affected.100, Bombay. Through the efforts of a local firebrand 2,000 mill workers in the Gokak Mills, Belgaum District, resorted to a stay-in-strike on July 11th. The owners asked for Government assistance ; the Home Minister promptly had a police force sent there, and the strike came to an end. On July 20th, however, all the 2,900 workers went on strike, the immediate cause being the refusal of the mana-gement to reinstate a discharged worker; at the end of the month the strike was continuing.101. Central Provinces. The Labour Enquiry Committee published its recommendations at the end of April, the most important being that 60 per cent, of the wage-cut enforced in 1934 should be restored. A dissenting minute was recorded by Mr. Kalappa, a Congress member of the Provincial Assembly, who argued for an immediate restoration of 75 per cent. There was some delay in dealing with the report, and on June 12th the textile workers decided to start a general strike on July 1st. On June 17th the Government issued its recommenda-tions on the Committee&apos;s report; they had agreed (by a majority) with the proposal to restore only 60 per cent, of the wage cut, with effect from May 1st, 1938. The management of the Mills accepted the Governments recommendation.Labour was not satisfied, and their so-called &quot; Council of Action &quot; adopted a resolution on June 27th expressing dissatisfaction with the decision, demanding a 75 per cent, restoration, and deciding to call a general strike on July 1st un-less Government and the employers agreed to refer the dispute to the arbitration of Congress leaders. On June 29th this condition was rejected by Government and the employers, and the stage was set for a general strike within two days. At the eleventh hour, an emergency meeting of the &quot; Council of Action &quot; decided to refer their difficulties to Jamnalal Bajaj, a member of the Congress Working Committee, and the general strike was postponed.102. Madras. In the middle of May the arbitrator announced his award in&apos; the Madura Mills dispute, described in paragraph 97 of the last Survey.   Both parties accepted the award and no further trouble has occurred.There have been several strikes in other mills in the Presidency, the most im-portant being that in the Choolai Mills in Madras when 2,000 workers struck on June 17th expressing dissatisfaction with the findings of a conciliation board and making various demands which the Management refused to meet. The strike, ended ori\ July 20th, the parties agreeing to the appointment by Government of an investigating officer. There has been considerable unrest among mill labour in Coimbatore, where several short-lived strikes occurred. Government has directed the Labour Commissioner to investigate. The Chittivalsa Jute Mills at Vizagapatam were the scene of another strike which commenced early in May and had not concluded by the end of July.103. Punjab. Communsits are said to have been responsible for bringing about a strike among textile workers in Amritsar at the end of May. The Manu-facturers&apos; Association would not agree to a demand for higher wages, and on May
-20th. 55 out of 100 factories closed down, affecting 1,500 men. On June 7th an agreement was reached and by the 9th nearly all the men had returned to work.104. Sind.-^-Theve have been a number of small strikes in Karachi.105. United Provinces. The Cawnpore Labour Union accepted as a basis for settling industrial disputes the recommendations of the Enquiry Committee as. described in the last Survey (paragraph 98). The history of this dispute deserves detailed treatment, as it has proved the most serious labour conflict with which any autonomous Provincial Government has had to deal. On May 13th the Employers&apos;&quot; Association rejected the Enquiry Committee&apos;s report in a representation to the Government which alleged the hostility of the Committee to the employers and &quot; gross partiality &quot; shown in favour of the Labour Union, and criticised the &quot; ad-mitted incompetence of the Enquiry Committee to deal with so higMy technical a matter &quot;..In anticipation of disorder extra police were despatched to Cawnpore. On May 16th 15,000 workers in the textile industry went on strike and on the next day the-number rose to 42,000 and all the mills closed down. The city Congress Committee-joined the side of the Labour Union and the strikers and condemned the hostile attitude of the employers.Although the workers put themselves in the wrong by resorting to the strike-method, it is impossible to absolve the employers from blame. Their attack on the-Enquiry Committee, after its report was published, came too late ; they raised no objection when it was constituted and did not take advantage of the opportunity given them by the Premier of giving their views on the report before it was pub-lished. While the strike was in progress, a number of influential British employers-had left the country, but those who remained for some time made no construc-tive suggestions to alleviate the position but simply demanded Government action to quell the spirit of indiscipline an attitude which the Ministry with some reason regarded as unhelpful.The Government at first adopted an attitude of neutrality, but after frequent consultations with the parties issued a resolution on June 12th containing their decisions on the report. They accepted nearly all the recommendations, gave it as. their opinion that the industry could bear the additional burden of extra wages, and urged that their findings should be implemented.. The Central Strike Committee welcomed these decisions, but the employers remained silent.By this time a critical stage was being reached in Cawnpore ; the strike had been in progress for four weeks, and the strikers&apos; capacity for holding out was taxed to the limit. Although about 80 per cent, of the workers had gone home to their villages, the difficulty of feeding the remainder was very real. Congress and the Labour Union started distributing free food early in June, but their funds were limited. , Picketing was started and intermittent arrests were made. On June 15th the restrictive orders which had been issued but which had not been strictly enforced were tightened up, and bands of picketers exceeding five in number were forbidden. During the next fortnight the number of arrests increased ; on one day 100 arrests were made when two mill owners were obstructed by picketers.After further discussions, Government and the employers came to a settlement on June 27th, whereby the employers agreed to the increase in wages and the appointment of a Labour Commissioner and machinery for settling strikes; they demanded the reorganisation of the Labour Union ; while Government agreed to. condemn unauthorised strikes. Hopes of agreement were diminished by the workers&apos; decision on July 1st not to return to work until all their demands were met, including the immediate recognition of the Labour Union.On July 4th after the strike had lasted seven weeks, a settlement was reached, thanks largely to the personal efforts of the Premier. While employers agreed to apply the wage increases to all mills in the Province, Government agreed that the Labour Union should not be recognised until after work was resumed and cer-tain reorganisation carried out&quot;. The Labour Commissioner will decide when the Union is properly reorganised. The Union has undertaken to give a fortnights notice of strike and to strike only after a decision by 60 per cent, of the workers : also to oppose all unauthorised strikes. Workers were given one week in which to resume work. They ratified the agreement on July 4th and on the next day some three-quarters of them returned to the reopened mills.The strike occurred a,t the peak period of the mills&apos; activities and the financial losses were considerable,   About 200 arrests were made in. all, and towards the
-end about 12,000 persons were being fed by relief committees. Significant features -of the strike were that all tbe workers went out. almost simultaneously, the strike was almost entirely peaceful, and no attempt was made to interfere with theessen-tial services. This shows that, whether, as has been sometimes alleged, the strikers were under the control of Communists or not, the control was in fact exercised in a restrained manner. It may be assumed that the moderation of the strikers was in part due to the belief that a Congress Ministry would see that they did not fail in their main objects.: and it may be deduced that a Congress Ministry, if acting with -discretion, should have some advantage in dealing with a serious labour dispute. The United Provinces Government^ attitude was in fact reasonable and patient; and the result appears to have been that the Congress right-wing has strengthened its position.(i) Terrorism.106. Terrorism has been forsworn by most of its former devotees : and, though with a number of them the conversion may be merely to the longer aim of mass revolution, the immediate result is to wean them from the active pursuit of violence. The investigation into the Pipridih railway dacoity (see paragraph 99 of the last Survey) has not established the connection of known terrorists with the crime. Similarly a serious railway accident in Bihar which is attributed to deliberate sabotage Gannot be proved to be the work of terrorists.Though there will be some ex-terrorists who will resort to crime in favourable conditions, and though the cult will always attract some conspirators, there is, at &quot;present no, evidence, even ampng released prisoners in Bengal, of a revival of terrorist methods. Favourable conditions- might result from any movement (such as extremist admirers of Subhas Bose hope that he, will lead in revolt from orthodox&apos; Congress policy) resulting in the left-wing breaking away and acting in independence of Congress.(j.) Communal Troubles.107. The quarter has been free, of major communal disturbances, though there haye been minor riots here and there.The. attitude of the Ministries towards incitement of- communal disorder, and particularly towards incitement in the Press, has hardened. The Bombay Govern-ment in May demanded security under the. Press (Emergency Powers) Act from a Muslim newspaper, the &quot; Al-IIilal &quot;, fox inciting,communal hatred. The Home Minister obtained the approval of the Congress Working Committee before he took this step. It is not long, since this Government proposed to repeal the Press (Emergency Powers) Act (see paragraph 77 of the last Survey), out the serious communal disorders in Bombay city in April gave the Home Minister reason to be glad that the proposal had not been accepted. The &quot; Al-Hilal &quot; failed to deposit the security demanded, the press has closed down, and the paper has ceased pubhcation.In view of increasing communal propaganda in the Central Provinces, that Government has issued orders that communal speeches shall be fully reported.The Punjab Ministry raised something of a storm in journalistic circles by proposing, in order to check communal propaganda, a measure which would have restricted the liberty of the Press. The Premier agreed to keep the Bill in ahey-ance for a while to see whether the provincial Press would keep an undertaking to restrain its exuberance.The Madras Ministry adopted a novel device to settle a communal dispute at Ambur between Hindus and Muslims. As a condition for the withdrawal of the cases arising out of a riot, each community was required to fine itself Bs. 2,000 and the money was appropriated by Government towards the cost of restoring order. The Muhammadans, regarding the other side as the aggressors, have been left with a sense of grievance.108. Shahidganj (Lahore). (See paragraph 102 of the last Survey). Although the Ahrars had abandoned civil disobedience at the end of April, the other Muslim organisation which had taken up this agitation, the Ittihad-i-Millat, decided to continue it. However, no more volunteers courted arrest, and on May 24th the Ittihad-i-Millat reversed their decision and civil disobedience ceased.ic-s196hd
In the middle of May the Lahore High Court granted leave to appeal to the Privy Council against its decision. It also passed orders that no building should be raised on the Shahidganj mosque site until December 1939. Thus the controversy is in abeyance.109. The Madh-e-Sahaba dispute (LucJcnow). (See paragraph 103 of the last Survey). There has been almost continual tension between the Shia and Sunni communities in Lucknow since the riots in April, but no open disorder. At the beginning of May, while representatives of the communities were trying to reach an amicable agreement, the Sunnis revived civil disobedience ; the movement lasted from May 6th to the 13th and during this period about 30 arrests were made. When the movement was called off all the prisoners were released and a conciliation committee continued the negotiations. Early in June renewed tension necessi-tated the issue of fresh restrictive orders, and in July the District Magistrate had to utter a stern warning to the communities that further restrictive orders would be issued in the event of disturbances.VI.-POLITICAL MOVEMENTS.(a) The Congress Party.110. A Congress Premiers&apos; Conference was convened at Bombay in May. All Premiers of the Congress Provinces and some members of the Working Committee attended, and from May 12th to the 15th may be presumed to have discussed matters of practical interest to the Ministries. Though no authorised account of the proceedings has been published, some information has come out. It was agreed that Provincial Ministries should have complete liberty to check tendencies to foment communal trouble and the preaching of violence in the name of civil liberty, and to deal effectively with communal troubles. Labour policy was considered; also the duties of Parliamentary Secretaries (see paragraph 61). It was decided that Congress Provinces should so far as possible follow the same agrarian policy. It is understood that the &quot; sedition &quot; section of the Indian Penal Code was discussed, but no official attempts have yet been made to get it amended. The conference decided that each Province should deal independently with the question of &quot; prohibition &quot;.111. Congress and Federation-The division of opinion in the Congress on the subject of the Federal scheme is becoming apparent. The division is roughly between those whose attitude is of such &quot; uncompromising hostility &quot; (the Presi-dent&apos;s phrase) that they will not even discuss its details and those who are prepared&apos; to indicate the amendments which would render it acceptable. (As was stated in paragraph 105 of the last Survey, the Haripura resolution attempted to bridge the difficult gulf between these positions.) The persistence in approach to the Muslim League, in the face of Jinnah&apos;s rough discouragement, is plausibly explained as indicating the keen desire of Congress to unite the country in defeating (or amending, according to the school of thought) the Federal scheme.Becent utterances have shown the growing suspicion entertained by the left-wing that the right-wing are secretly playing the Federation game. An utterance at a discussion attended by Jawaharlal Nehru in England was so reported in India as to suggest that Bhulabhai Desai (Congress leader in the Central Assembly) while in England gave people to understand that the Congress are likely to work the Federal scheme in much the same way as they had accepted Provincial Auto-autonomy. This brought from Subhas Bose an excited denial that any Congress leader would stoop to negotiate with the British Government on Federation : he threatened &quot; civil war &quot; within the Congress if the scheme were adopted by a majority in that body : and he himself would feel it his duty to &quot; lay down the burden of office in order to be free to carry on a raging and tearing campaign against the Federal scheme &quot;. He was at once taken up by Satyamurti, deputy leader of the Congress party in the Central Assembly : after rebuking Bose for the threat of revolt from the party he stated the alterations subject to which Congress might well accept the scheme. The press was full of comment on this controversy : and Bose issued further statements, explaining away his threat of rebellion, but claiming good authority for rejection of Federation as sound Congress doctrine.   Bose has
SIthereby won the open support of the Congress Socialists and left-wing leaders generally. Left-wing organisations in Bengal are believed to have urged him to form an anti-Federation block within the All-India Congress Committee to oppose the acceptance of Federation, and even to have suggested that the Working Com-mittee should be dissolved, if necessary, to create a crisis within Congress.Subhas Bose has always been an extremist, and in choosing him as President Gandhi may well have hoped to draw him (like his predecessor Jawaharlal Nehru) towards the centre. Nehru is capable of sinking his personal views in the good of the party : Bose has no such loyalty, and for some time past his vanity has suffered from the small account taken of his opinions and his exclusion from the inner counsels of the moderates who rule the party. Had the Working Committee, meeting at the end of July, been free to thresh out the Federation controversy, Bose might have had to choose between submission and revolt : but other more pressing subjects have hitherto claimed attention : and India still awaits a clear definition of the Congress attitude towards the Federal scheme. Meanwhile intense interest has been taken in Jawaharlahs contacts with the leaders of political thought in England, and no denials will dissipate the belief that Lord Linlithgow&apos;s presence there will be employed for devising a means of making the scheme acceptable. That belief, while comfortable to the moderates, explains such threats from the left-wing as that of Subhas Bose quoted with approval in a Congress Newsletter of late June &quot; If civil disobedience were to begin, it would be more powerful and extensive than before, and would not confine itself to British India but would extend to the Indian States also.&quot;112. The Working Committee&apos;s activities have been mentioned in various contexts in this Survey. The recent meeting at Wardha, still continuing, will be memorable for the assertion, explicit and implicit, of new claims over Provincial party and Ministerial affairs as an outcome of the Central Provinces crisis. These have been described earlier in the Survey : they may be summarised here : A Premier may not take action against colleagues or recruit new colleagues without the consent of the Working Committee : for having acted without consultation with the Committee Khare was compelled to resign his leadership of the party and his Ministership and to tender the resignation of his newly-recruited colleagues : he was in effect debarred from standing again for the leadership of the party : the party meeting was invaded by Congress leaders who did not belong to the Province, and was awed into electing the nominee of the Committee.These claims may have been implicit in the Congress organisation and its past dealings with provincial autonomy : but so crude an assertion of them has shocked a large body of Congress opinion. Further, the condemnation of the Governor for dealing with his Premier and Ministers instead of waiting on the will of the Working Committee has met with general disapproval as a blatant negation of democratic principle and practice, of Ministerial responsibility to the legislature, and of joint responsibility within the Cabinet.There can be no doubt that the Working Committee has done harm to its reputation by its handling, especially in the last phase, of C. P. affairs.113. The Rupee Ratio. At the Congress Premiers&apos; conference held in May it appears that Subhas Bose, possibly at the instigation of certain Bombay merchants, proposed an agitation in favour of the reduction of the rupee ratio. The proposal was for a joint demand by the Congress Provincial Governments. The Finance Minister of Bombay then sounded the Finance Ministers of non-Congress Provinces, On June 7th the Central Government made its own attitude clear in a communique which announced that the present value of the rupee is to be maintained in the interests of India and that there is no intention of altering it. The Congress leaders, meeting at Wardha later in June, decided to collect the opinions of associations and individiials in Bombay and Calcutta and lay them before the Working Committee.Subhas Bose (more suo) made an aggressive statement in reply to the Govern-ment communique &quot; It is not for the Government but for the people to dictate what the ratio shoidd be &quot;. Vallabhai Patel is said to have made the laconic com-rnent : &quot; Who made Subhas Bose an economist ?&quot; It seems fairly certain that no official decision of Congress has yet been made to demand a reduction in the ratio, and there is some doubt whether the capitalist pressure, to which Congress leadership has always been susceptible, will be sufficiently strong to procure such a decision.
114. Attitude to &quot; Untouchables &quot;-(see paragraph 107 of the last Survey).  The Bombay Bill permitting trustees to throw open temples to &quot; Harijans &quot; has received the assent of the Governor-General. The private Bill which was referred to Select Committee in Madras will probably be taken up at the next session of the Assembly.115. Attitude to States. The Congress attitude towards the hostilities in Mysore State was described in paragraph 108 of the last Survey. In the first week in May the warring parties reached an agreement : the State and the Congress flags should in future he hoisted together, the State would, recognise the Mysore State Congress.and the Congress would co-operate with the constitutional reforms com-mittee. It is significant that Vallabhai Patel, who visited Mysore at the time, advised the Congress party there to discard the name of Congress, to attach less importance to flag-hoisting, and to avoid disputes with the State officials, and warned them that the Congress party would not encourage a struggle for the flag in Indian States. On May 15th the Working. Committee passed a resolution, repeating in different terms that part of the Haripura resolution which said that the word &quot; Congress &quot; should not be adopted by independent organisations function-ing in Indian States. Another resolution about the Mysore riots noted with satis-faction that an agreement had been reached, emphasised again that each party should respect the other&apos;s flag, and explained that the Congress attitude to.the State remained friendly ; and ended with the hope that responsible Government would soon be introduced. The outccm.3 has caused loss of prestige to the Durbar in that the intervention of Congress leaders of British India was not only tolerated but sought, and the Congress High Command was treated as an authority parallel to that of the State.Recently there has been trouble arising from Congress agitation in the Nilgiri -State directed from Orissa.   On July 24th the Working Committee passed a resolution expressing sympathy with the people of the State in the non-violent struggle which they have been carrying on.It is outside the scope of this Survey to trace the influence on the internal politics of States of the Congress doctrines propagated in British India. There is however evidence of the growing force of such influence : and the successful interference of Congress leaders in conflicts between State rulers and their subjects (e.g., of Vallabhai Patel in revenue disputes in States bordering the Bombay Presi-dency) is an indication that State boundaries are now no barriers to the spread of Congress methods, and doctrines.116. Attitude to Indians Overseas. In the first week of May an agreement was arrived at in the Zanzibar clove dispute (see paragraph 109 of the last Survey). The Working Committee passed a resolution on May 15th which first asserted that the agreement was subject to the confirmation of the Indian National Congress and then went on to confirm it. The Committee authorised the Clove Boycott Committee to lift the embargo, and congratulated the Indian community in Zanzibar on its brave stand on behalf of the rights of Indians overseas.117. The Bugti area. During its session in May, the Working Committee passed a resolution about the administration in the Bugti area. This is an area to the north of the Provhice of Sind, bordering also on the Punjab and Baluchistan, with a population of some 30,000 only, ruled by a headman known as the Nawab who is under the administrative control of the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. A sum of Rs. 6,000 per mensem is paid to the Nawab by the Govern-ment of India for the maintenance of local officials and police. In 1932 a Commis-sion was appointed to enquire into various complaints made against the present Nawab, who has held the office since 1917. The Working Committee&apos;s resolution drew attention to the oppressive administration of the Nawab and to the sense of insecurity of life and property prevailing in that area. It demanded the publica-tion of the report made by the Commission in 1932, asserted that the authorities concerned, had failed to discharge their responsibility, and asked for immediate action to be taken to remedy the situation.118. GandMs continued domination of Congress policy will be evident from a perusal of this Survey.   His health now causes no anxiety.119. Jawaharlal Nehru wrote to Gandhi in May, complaining that Congress Ministries were doing little more than adapting themselves to the old order, and saying that as, he felt himself to be a &quot; misfit &quot; in India he was sailing for Europe to escape his mental worries.   Though Nehru is even more subject to moods, of
depression than his leader, it is not easy to understand why he gave Gandhi this reason for his European tour ; it was reported, and subsequent events have proved the reliability of the forecast/that Nehru wished to make important contacts abroad to strengthen India&apos;s status, and to show that, while Britain has the power in India, Congress has the popular support. Nehru&apos;s activities in Europe have been fully reported in the ,press and Tequire no mention here.(b) The Muslim League.120. Great interest has been taken in the &quot; unity talks &quot; between represen-tatives of the Congress and the Muslim League, the early stages of which were mentioned in paragraph 112 of the last Survey. At that point, though there had been correspondence between Jinnah and Gandhi and also between Jinnah and Jawarharlal iNehru, the only meeting had been that of April 28th, between Gandhi and Jinnah in Bombay. The next stage was discussion between Jinnah and Subhas Bose from May 11th to the 15th. Bose is believed to have defined the Congress terms for a settlement somewhat as follows : (1) that members of the Muslim League should sign the Congress pledge, (2) that Muslim League parties in Legislatures should support the Congress programme,(3) that the League should co-operate with Congress in the struggle against Federation.Jinnah would not commit himself before consulting his colleagues on the League Executive Council. -121. The Council met on June 4th in Bombay and unanimously approved the reply to be sent to Bose.   This was in the form of three resolutions : (1) There could be no further negotiations unless Congress accepted theLeague as the only organisation representing Muslims in India. (2) If that condition were accepted, negotiations should take place between committees representing the parties, but no Muslim should be a mem-ber of the Congress committee. (3) The League before taking any decision would have to ascertain the views, and act on behalf, of all the minorities in India. This last condition seems to have been inserted because there is a clause in the League constitution pledging it to safeguard the interests of all communities.122. No one had any real expectation of a settlement : but the atmosphere was rendered highly unfavourable by the unauthorised publication in the Press of the correspondence between Jinnah on the one hand and Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru on the other. Towards Gandhi Jinnah showed no excessive courtesy : towards Nehru, whose letters were pitched in a tone of careful reasonableness, Jinnah was positively truculent : and on the very day the Executive Council was considering the reply to be sent to Congress, Jinnah addressed meetings in Bombay in most aggressive language, stigmatising Congress as a rank communal body masquerading in the garb of a national organisation. The Hindu Mahasabha and the Congress Socialists announced then opposition to the discussions, and the former added that any settlement would not be binding on the Hindus until the Mahasabha had agreed to it.123. In the.last week of June, Congress party leaders met at Wardha to consider Jinnah&apos;s offer : but a decision was postponed till the meeting of the Working Com-mittee which began on Jiuy 23rd. Jinnah was informed of the Working Com-mittee&apos;s decision in a letter from Subhas Bose, and the matter was placed before the League Executive Council on July 30th. It is stated that the letter, while acknow-ledging the League as an important all-India organisation of Muslims, representing a certain school of Muslim opinion, rejected the League&apos;s claim to be the only body representing. Muslims in India : it rejected also the demand that &apos;: nationalist Muslims &quot; should not take part in any negotiations between Congress and the League : as regards the needs of minority communities, if the League would abandon its insistence on non-essentials the Congress is ready to negotiate. The tone of the letter is described as friendly, and calculated to leave the door open for further dis-cussion : but it is difficult to see how the recipient could regard it in that light. At the end of the quarter the result of the League&apos;s deliberations had not yet been pub-lishecl; but it is understood that in a long and argumentative reply to the Congress President Jinnah maintains his position and refutes the Congress pleas : and thatLS196HD
no suggestion is made either for continuing or for ending the negotiations. In the meanwhile (as in June) Jinnah had improved the occasion by a public denunciation of Congress : he accused the High Command of being intoxicated with power, described the Congress as a communal organisation, and said that, whatever the result of the negotiations, there could be no compromise because the League in its present position of relative weakness would not be able to compel Congress to abide by the terms of a pact.124. The League is said to be gaining ground in the North-West Frontier-Province, in Sind, and in Bombay. In the North-West Frontier Province the League won a bye-election in July by the small margin of 13 votes in a poll of 3,500. This was something of a blow to the Government, but also disappointed the League which, having sent Shaukat Ali to assist in the campaign, expected a more resounding victory. In the Punjab an important bye-election in Amritsar was won by the Unionist (Muslim) candidate against a Prominent Congressman who had been successful at the previous election.(c) Other Opposition to Congress.125. The Hindu Mahasabha. This organisation has not been active during the-quarter. Savarkar, visiting the Punjab in May, made an unhelpful speech about the Shahidganj dispute, espousing the cause of the Sikhs, promising them the assistance of thousands of volunteers if necessary, and advising them to continue their struggle against the Muslims.126. Other Muslim, organisations. The abandonment by the Ahrars and Ittihad-i-Millat of the Shahidganj agitation has been mentioned in paragraph 108. None of their other activities calls for mention.The &quot; Bed Shirts &quot; (Khudai Khidmatgars) organisation in the North-West Frontier Province is formally separate from the Congress, although its aims are the same. The return of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, the acknowledged leader, and the rais-ing of the ban on the movement last August led to an open revival of the organisa-tion, which now claims to have 60,000 members, a number which is probably ex-aggerated. Abdul Ghaffar Khan is at present taking a peaceful line, though he; constantly reminds his audiences to be prepared for the next conflict with the British Government.VII.-SPECIAL PROBLEMS,(a) Palestine.127. The measures taken to combat the recent revival of terrorist outrages in Palestine have been criticised in the press ; various sections of Muslims have issued &quot; warnings &quot; to the British Government that their repression of the Arabs may have disastrous consequences. But there is still no concerted or intensive agitation, and the Congress have shown only fitful interest in the subject. A considerable . amount of literature, some of it produced in London, which denounces the British administration in Palestine, is reaching India. A great deal of this, with the assistance of the Bombay Government, is prevented from reaching the addressees; but it is inevitable that some should get through.The Council of the all-India Muslim League meeting in Delhi at the end of July passed a resolution moved by the President that &quot; Palestine Day &quot; should be observed throughout India on August 20th. The Council further resolved to appoint a committee to consider the&quot; question of sending a deputation to England and Palestine, and directed the committee to consider ways and means whereby effective pressure should be brought to bear on the British Government and also to advise the Council regarding the possibility of a boycott of British goods. It is said that this resolution was passed only after heated discussion.(b) &quot;Prohibition&quot;.128. &quot; Prohibition &quot; has not made much way in the non-Congress Provinces, but all the Congress Provinces have made a serious beginning with the experi-ment.
The Assam and Punjab Governments are still at the stage of deliberation. There is nothing of interest to say about the progress of the measure in Bengal. The Sind Government have decided, to raise the duty on the drug &quot; charas &quot; and on country liquor, and applications for new liquor shops have been rejected.In Madras the experiment has special importance, since in this respect Madras has shewn the way to the other Congress Provinces. Comments in previous Surveys have Stressed the inadvisability of accepting as yet the success of the measure. It must however be admitted that an impressive beginning has been made in Salem district. In particular the positive side of the experiment in efforts to achieve &quot; better living &quot; has been kept in view, and activity has by no means been Confined to repression and punishment. The Premier has acknow-ledged in enthusiastic terms the zeal of the local officials responsible for the ad-ministration of the measure.It must still be remembered that lasting results are difficult to obtain : immemorial habits are not easily changed, the belief in the nutritive qualities of toddy is general among the labouring classes, and the production of alcoholic liquor is both simple and hard to detect. It is probable that greater success has. been achieved in the urban areas than in the rural areas of Salem district.The missionary earnestness of the Premier on this subject may threaten some danger to the independence of officials. In Salem the Collector and Superintendent of Police voluntarily, but in response to a suggestion from the Premier, elected not to take out permits for consumption which would have been granted on appli-cation. It is now intended to extend the experiment to two other districts on October 1st; and, if emphasis is laid on the Salem example, the local officials may be faced with the option of becoming reluctant teetotallers or of incurring Ministerial displeasure.In Bihar the Government, reviewing the experience of three months&apos; &quot; pro-hibition &quot; in Saran district, profess to be well satisfied with the results though it is admitted that half the tappers of the district have migrated.In Bombay also Dr. Gilder, the Excise Minister, is satisfied with the results in Ahmednagar. His ardour for total prohibition throughout the Province was somewhat damped by the departmental Secretary&apos;s explanation that it would involve a loss of 3  crores of rupees which could not be replaced.On July 20th the Ahmedabad area was declared &apos;; dry &quot;. It was intended to introduce a modified form of &quot; prohibition &quot; there a month earlier, whereby the sale of liquor would be forbidden but importation and consumption under licence would be permitted. The higher Congress authorities insisted on sterner methods, and under the present scheme consumption is to be restricted to licensees selected by an advisory committee. So far it is said that only 171 applications have been received.The Central Provinces Government have issued a communique expressing satisfaction with the progress of the measure, claiming that crime and gambling-have decreased, and also that the popularity of tea as a beverage is increasing.In the North-West Frontier Province a start has recently been made in the district of Dera Ismail Khan, where the import and possession of country and foreign liquor and of the drug bhang have been prohibited.The Orissa Government have decided to order the closure of opium shops in Balasore district during the year. No new liquor shops are to be permitted and those in prominent centres are to be removed to unobtrusive localities.In the United Provinces the scheme, introduced in two districts, proceeds on the lines laid down in Madras -propaganda through every possible agency and counter-attractions for addicts, combined with vigilance in the prosecution of offenders.The effect on the amenities of the Defence services stationed in &quot; dry &quot; areas of the restrictions recently imposed on the consumption of alcoholic liquor is under examination.(e) Gujarat Lands (Bombay).129. This intractable problem shows signs of coming to a head.During May the Ministry, still hoping to settle the problem by negotiation, asked the Governor to permit the Collectors of the three districts concerned to use their influence with the present owners of the lands.   The   Governor was
prepared to allow them to conclude such negotiations as had started with owners who were prepared to accept the terms offered, but refused to let them try per-suasion on unwilling owners. The Ministers then reluctantly decided that they themselves should do the persuasion, after terms had heen communicated to the owners, and such of these as were whling to accept the terms would be left to approach the Collectors, who would employ the normal machinery to clinch the deal. &quot; Persuasion &quot; on the part of some Congress workers savoured of boycott: for histance, one owner who wanted Its. 30,000 for his land was persuaded to accept Rs. 1,000 when his aged mother was deprived of all domestic help.The attitude of the Ministers changed suddenly in June. Gandhi, to whom the retention of the lands by the present owners appears a moral offence, found serious fault with the Ministers&apos; too pliant handling of the problem. On his direc-tion, they presented the Governor with a note which stated that the methods hitherto tried were doomed to fa lure, that the sales of 1931 had been vindictive, that the buyers deserved no compensation, and that as there had been a &quot; transfer of power &quot; under the Act they, the Ministers, had a right to redress the wrong-done. They therefore intended to offer the present owners no more than the price they had paid seven years ago plus the money actually spent on permanent improvements : and if this offer were refused, they would dispossess the owners by legislation.The lead in the Ministry on this question has once more been taken by Munshi (Home and Law Minister). The Ministers themselves are reluctant to force a crisis, and the Governor has found them reasonable in discussion : but the com-pulsion of Gandhi and of Vallabhai Patel is heavy on them, and they will without doubt be forced to resign if a settlement is not reached.Recently Munshi, on the Governors invitation, has drafted a Bill which indi-cates the terms on which the Ministry propose to expropriate the present owners. This provides for a tribunal, to consist of, or to he presided over by, a Judge, which will fix the compensation in each case on the following method : First the total will be calculated of (a) the sum originally paid, (6) the value of improvements made by the purchasers, (c) the land revenue paid on the land from the date of purchase up to the date of acquisition, and (d) 4% per annum on these items : from that total will be deducted (i) the profit derived from the land in the period, and (ii) the money value of any damage caused to the land : to the nett amount 15% (the amount prescribed by the Land Acquisition Act as compensation for compulsory acquisition) will be added.Here, as in a number of Tenancy Bills mentioned elsewhere, the qi estion before the Governor is whether the terms of expropriation are such that he can give the previous sanction required under section 299 (3) of the Government of India Act. The question is still under consideration : hut what appears an un-acceptable element is the deduction of the profit derived from the land : this, in the first place, the tribunal will be unable to calculate, both because accounts will not he forthcoming and because the term &quot; profit &quot; is undefined : and even if tl e calculation could be made, the effect might well be that the nett compensation would he nil. Broadly speaking, a reasonable interpretation both of the pledge of 1930 (see paragraph 38 of Survey no. 1) and of the intention of section 299 requires that the present owners should not be dispossessed except on such terms as will not only leave them with whatever profit they have been able to make on the cultivation of the lands but also provide a substantial element of compensation over and above their initial outlay and reasonable compensation for disturbance.(d) The Congress Flag and Bande Mataram.130. The flag controversy has attracted little attention and the Congress party&apos;s enthusiasm for their &quot; national &quot; emblem, appears to be waning. A few incidents may be mentioned;In the Madras Presidency, the Municipality of Girntux after trying in vain to decide the rival claims of the Muslim League and Congress, decided to fly both flags on municipal buildings. The Government asked them to reconsider this decision as two flags, could not be flown simultaneously ; the Municipality then elected to hoist the Congress flag only. At a village near Ootacamund the Congress flag which had been formally hoisted by the Labour Minister was removed and the flagstaff felled.   Expecting a breach of the peace the District Magistrate prohibited
the villagers from re-erecting it ; on receiving a protest the Premier endorsed this order. In the Jhansi district of the United Provinces things came to such a pass that five flags of various significance were hoisted simultaneously on a municipal building. At a town in Bihar the Union Jack, which had been hoisted in honour of the King&apos;s birthday, was pulled down and a statue of King Edward VII was disfigured ; a notice was found conveying a warning against hoisting any but the Congress flag.There have been no incidents or developments connected with the singing of &quot; Bande Mataram &quot;, of which in fact little is now heard.(e) Anti-war and anti-recruiting propaganda.131. The public announcements of Congress leaders maintain the decision to refrain from assistance to Britain in a future war. At the same time a solution has to be found for the problem of defending a free India from the threat of invasion. Dr. Lohia, of the Foreign Affairs Department of the Congress, ridicules the idea that India stands in danger of invasion by a foreign power and hopes ( in spite of the example of China) that if the improbable came to pass, India would not look in vain for help from democratic countries. At the same time he thinks that India&apos;s solution is to concentrate on widespread military training and the formation of a national militia. Two Congress Ministries share the feeling that military training is essential : in the United Provinces a&quot; scheme is afoot for compulsory military training in schools, and in Bihar a special college is contemplated, to include instruction in aviation. Similar ideas are said to be germinating in the Central Provinces. The Bihar Government also published a pamphlet emphasising the need of encouraging interest in military science among the young, urging that secondary schools should become military schools, and demanding recognition of the need of attracting first-rate Indian brains to the Indian Army. Lohia&apos;s conviction of India&apos;s immunity from foreign attack is not shared by all ; Subhas Bose has been heard to lay stress on India&apos;s vulnerability, and Savarkar, the President of the Hindu Mahasabha, loses no opportunity of advocating the neces-sity of India&apos;s manhood being trained to protect the country.Anti-recruiting propaganda has continued, particularly in the Punjab, but there are few indications that it has penetrated very deep. There is said to have been a slight falling off in the number of recruits in certain districts in the Lahore area, and military pensioners in the Punjab canvassed actively on behalf of the Congress candidate in an Amritsar bye-election, which shows that constant pro-paganda may ultimately take effect. In the United Provinces a good deal of in-terest is taken in the Garhwali who is the only one of those who mutinied at Pesha-war in 1930 now remaining in jail. Glorification of his offence is particularly obnoxious in a cantonment bazaar : this occurred recently at a meeting at Lans-downe in the United Provinces.(f) Language in Legislatures.132. In paragraph 122 of the last Survey it was stated that the views of Governors were being obtained on the advisability of amending section 85 of the Government of India Act so as to permit freer use of the vernacular in legislative bodies. Governors&apos; opinions vary widely, according to the different circumstances prevailing in each Province.In Madras there are five recognised languages, so that members can usually make themselves understood by the whole House only by speaking in English. Here and in Bombay an amendment is undesirable. Other Governors refer to the complexity of the problem, and while some would favour an amendment giving wider discretion to Speakers, others think that an amendment is superfluous because the Speaker has already successfully circiimvented the provisions of section 85 : an amendment therefore would not alter the actual practice and might weaken the safeguard in that section. Several Governors emphasise the importance of retaining English as the official language of legislation, correspondence, records, etc. Some have suggested that a proviso should be included that any speech should be translated for the benefit of those who cannot understand it. No further decision has yet been made.MSWGHD

In the meantime the Speaker of the Punjab has followed the line taken by-some other Speakers, and has given a ruling that anyone who likes can speak in the vernacular, whether he is acquainted with English or not. The result is that practically all speeches in the recent session were delivered in the vernacular.VIII.-THE CENTRAL LEGISLATURES.(a) and (b). The Central Assembly and the Council of State.133. Neither of the Central Legislative bodies has met during the quarter.
APPENDIX.[See paragraph 53 (m)].The following analysis shows the results of the Governor Generals enquiry from Governors about the increasing strain placed on the Services since the advent of Provincial Autonomy. In each case an analysis of the replies has been made into &quot; non-Congress &quot; and &quot; Congress &quot; Provinces so as to distinguish, where possible, conditions arising out of a Congress regime from those resulting from the introduction of Provincial Autonomy generally. Sind has been classed as a non-Congress Province, although the present policy of the Ministry is largely under Congress influence.(a) (i) To what extent has the introduction of Provincial Autonomy resulted in an increase in the strain on Headquarter Secretariats ?Non-Congress Provinces.Governors all state that there has been an increase in the strain on the Secretariats.   The main causes (given by all or some of the four Governors) are as follows : -(1) The general inexperience of the members of the Legislature. (2) The large number of questions put in the Legislature.(3) Work entailed in dealing with petty and personal points arising out of the excessive accessibility of Ministers to members of their Party and the public generally. (4) The number of Committees appointed to examine subjects of all kinds. (5) Tendency of the Ministry to reopen old questions^(6) The inconvenience caused to Secretaries by Ministers making calls on their time outof ordinary office hours. (7) The fact that the old style Secretariat was accustomed to set the pace for the Legis-lature while the tables are now turned. (8) Need for adaptation in structure of Secretariat and manner in which business is dis-posed of.In some respects the pressure is probably temporary in character.Congress Provinces.The Governors of all Congress Provinces except one state categorically that there has been an increase in the strain all round ; in the Province where the volume of work has not appreci-ably increased, it is noted that the greater demand now made on the patience and temper of officers is probably more wearing than longer hours.   Elsewhere it is observed that the strain has increased since Congress took office rather than since the introduction of Provincial Autonomy.   The main causes (mostly common to all Provinces in varying degrees) are : -(a) The inexperience of Ministers, which necessitates more noting. (6) Enormous programme of legislative   and   administrative  reform which the new Ministry wants to carry out simultaneously and at once.(c) Protracted sittings of the Legislature and unprecedented volume of work, including an inordinate number of resolutions and questions.(d) Complaints are now made in very large numbers direct to Ministers ; where personalcases regarding Government servants are raised in this manner the question generally leads to reviewing departmental proceedings, etc.(e) Inadequate number of Ministers to deal with the work in some Provinces.(/) Tendency of Ministers to keep everything in their own hands and their unwillingness to delegate any power to permanent Secretaries.(g) The review of large numbers of orders passed by former Governments.(h) Proposals for overhaul of the administrative machine, altering relations with thepublic, eradicating corruption in the Services, etc.(i) Difficulty of the subordinate Secretariat staff in noting,  through reluctance toelaborate the principles underlying - precedents as these may not be acceptable to the present Government. This throws the responsibility of stating the orthodox view on to the Secretary. (j) In certain Provinces the unbusiness-like methods of Ministers, their delay in dis-posal of cases, and the political pressure put on them, lead to disorganisation of work.Some Provinces have increased their Secretariat staff to deal with the increased volume of work, but still find that the staff at their disposal is insufficient. One Governor remarks that for reasons of economy it has hitherto been the tradition to administer India with the bare minimum of superior  staff. *Some Governors make the important point that much of this increased volume of work is likely to prove temporary, while other Governors stress the point that the intensity of the strain varies considerably with, the temperaments of officers.
General.Broadly speaking, the increased volume of work owing to the inexperience of Ministers and the Legislatures is common to both Congress and non-Congress Provinces. The intensity of the pressure is to a large degree relative to tho extent of the Governments legislative programme-and therefore greater in Congress Provinces with their more ambitious and aggressive programmes.(a) (ii) To what extent has the introduction of Provincial Autonomy resulted in an increase inthe strain on District Officers?Non-Congress Provinces.The general impression is that the introduction of Provincial Autonomy has resulted in an increased strain on district officers. The spate of Assembly. questions has its reaction an district officers who are often required to go to considerable trouble in providing information for replies.The most definite causes of increased work are : (1) Interference of M.L.As., and politicians generally, and(2) Trouble caused by Ministers and the demands made by them on the time of the dis-trict officer when they are on tour.Congress Provinces.The Governors&apos; views on this question vary ; in two Provinces the strain is said to have-undoubtedly increased, while in others the answer is not so positive.   Conditions differ in each Province as a result of the varying programmes adopted ; the following specific- causes of in-creased work are mentioned by different Governors i  (1) Old, settled questions are reopened.(2) Officers must report in detail instead of passing brief orders. (3) Reports are called for on multitudinous petty matters.(4) Powers of officers are circumscribed in many ways, requiring constant reference-to Government for orders.(5) Ministers tour more frequently and when&apos; on tour require attendance of district officers at public functions which they attend.(6) Tiresome but extensive activities of Congress busybodies.(7) Increased communal tension.(8) Relations of landlord and tenant and the difficulty in collecting land revenue. (9) The abolition of Honorary Magistrates before any scheme was ready for their replacement has added to the strain on the stalls of district officers.General.On the whole the picture as far as the district officers are concerned is more encouraging: than the picture as regards the Secretariat. The strain is greater in the Congress Provinces; for, much the same reasons as in the case of the Secretariats, but in Congress Provinces the past history of the.relations between Congress and Government is an important additional factor..(b) Is any such increase on such a scale as to impose a really material addition to the burden.of the officers concerned ?Non-Congress Provinces.Generally speaking, the Governors agree that the increase is not excessive except in indi-vidual cases. Particular departments are especially hard pressed, e.g., the Legal and Legislative Departments, who have extra work in the drafting of Bills, etc., at short notice. In some Pro-vinces the increase has been met by internal arrangements.- Congress Provinces.Nearly all Governors agree- that the increased strain has imposed a really material acldi-tion to the burden of officers, especially-in the Secretariat. In certain cases the added strain has accelerated the collapse of officers who were not particularly fit; and the proposals of certain Ministries for reduction of staff will, if carried out, aggravate the position ; but it may safely be said that breaking point has, not yet been- reached.General.The indication is of a greater strain on and a material addition to the burden of officers in Congress Provinces, especially in the Secretariat.
(c) Has the burden shown itself more markedly in the case of officers of a particular standing,e.ff., 20 years, European, Indian, etc ?Non-Congress Provinces.The general opinion is that the burden has not shown itself more markedly in any particular classes, and it has been observed by one Governor that the incidence of the strain is largely a question of individual temperament: some officers who are wedded to the ideal of efficiency cannot tolerate the idea of its relaxation.Congress Provinces.Opinions vary widely; some Governors state that the burden is evenly distributed and others that the more senior officers, i.e., those with more than 20 years&apos; service feel the strain most, possibly because they find it more difficult to adjust themselves to the new conditions. It is likely that the burden falls rather on particular posts than on particular individuals. While some Governors consider that the strain falls on Europeans and Indians alike, others find the strain greater on the Europeans.(d) Are you satisfied that what may be called the key positions-e.g., the posts of Chief and other Secretaries, Divisional Commissioners, Heads of Departments are being, and will be, filled by the best possible men PNon-Congress Provinces.All Governors agree that for the present the best available men are holding the most im-portant posts, with very few exceptions. But the margin is small and the demands of the Central Government make it difficult to find Europeans for districts.Congress Provinces.All Governors agree that for the present the important posts are filled by the best possible men, but their opinions are qualified. There is little scope for selection to the key posts, and the attitude of individual Ministers to the Services is an important and varying factor in the appointments made. Certain Governors have had considerable difficulty in persuading their Ministries to appoint the men they needed. There is a tendency to select by seniority rather than merit.General.Governors are generally fairly well satisfied so far as the present is concerned, but those in Congress Provinces are not too happy about the future. Political considerations are a consider-able factor in Congress Provinces in addition to purely Service considerations, among which the maintenance of adequate supplies of man-power is important.(e) Are you satisfied that the reserves of skilled personnel, particularly in the All-India services at your disposal, are adequate to deal with an emergency situation, whether in the constitu-tional field or such as would follow on an outbreak of war in which the Empire was involved or the like, without the risk of an administrative breakdown ?Non-Congress Provinces. In three Provinces out of the four the replies are on the whole affirmative.Congress Provinces,Only two Governors are satisfied that their personnel is adequate to meet an emergency; the remainder are either doubtful, or certain that the personnel is inadequate. Important  points  made  are  as  follows: (1) Several Governors emphasise the necessity in the event of war of resisting therelease of civil officers for Military service, whether overseas or in India. (2) The use of retired officers in the case of an emergency is suggested. (3) One Governor makes the point that there is considerable elasticity in the day-to-day administration in India : side by side with matters vitally important there are administrative activities, e.g., rural reconstruction, which could be slowed down or even suspended without any permanent deterioration. (4) Two Governors consider that a Section 93 situation would relieve the strain on the Secretariat considerably.
( ) If your answer to (e) is in the negative, have you any suggestions for meeting such a situafiorE in terms of man-power, e.g., over-recruitment ?Non-Congress Provinces,The views of Governors vary considerably.   The remedies suggested are as follows :: -(1) Recall of officers now serving with the-Government of India. (2) Increased use of Provincial Service officers.(3) The emergency remedy previously tried by the Government of Bengal of recruiting-military officers on short period contracts, (4) Recall of retired Provincial Service officers. (.5) Utilisation of officers from other departments.Congress Provinces,Here again there is considerable difference of opinion. The remedies suggested&quot; by Gover-nors are as follows : (1) While three Governors suggest a measure of over-recruitment, three others oppose-strongly any change in recruitment which would upset the present balance and produce future difficulties. (2) Two Governors suggest the extended use of Provincial Service Officers, (3) Several Governors refer to the necessity, which will arise in the event of an emergency, of recalling officers on duty outside the Province, i.e. those serving under the Gov-ernment of India.(4) One Governor suggests that the recall of retired officers will be a partial remedy. (5) Another Governor suggests that the system of nomination to the I. C. S,, if found successful, might be extended to the Indian Police.General,The difference in the replies under headings (e) and (/) between Congress and non-Congress is not so marked as under other headings, although it is clear that the reserve in Congress Pro-vinces is not so substantial as that in non-Congress Provinces. But the possible remedies for maintaining the Service position and strengthening the reserves are limited and are much the-same for Congress and non-Congress Provinces.With regard to the remedies suggested it is noticeable that only one Governor comes down whole-heartedly in favour of over-recruitment. Those who recommend it recommend it in a-limited form, while several are strongly opposed to it in view of the obvious difficulties it creates-subsequently in blocks for promotion.Governors in both Congress and non-Congress Provinces refer to the difficulties involved in the supply of officers from the Provinces for service under the Government of India, whether in the Secretariat or Political Service.(g) To what extent is the constant pressure noticeable in certain cases for the reduction of amenities or the curtailment of long-established privileges (e.g. the move to hill stations) and tendency to pinprick ?Non-Congress Provinces.The position in non-Congress Provinces is fairly satisfactory. Generally speaking, there have been few attempts to reduce the amenities of the Services.Congress Provinces.In Congress Provinces, reduction of amenities and curtailment of privileges are threatened in several directions. In four Provinces an attack has been made on the summer exodus to the hills ; in a fifth it is doubtful if it will continue. Reduction in the pay of future entrants to the Provincial Civil Services is being enforced in one Province, and reductions in travelling allowance in several Provinces are either-already sanctioned or contemplated. Congress are also pledged in some Provinces to the abolition of senior posts, to which members of the Services naturally aspire.Two Governors refer specifically to tendencies to &quot; pinprick &quot; ; one of these mentions the rudeness of Ministers especially towards Indian officers. Constant reference to corruption among the Services causes considerable resentment. One Governor mentions that even where delibe-rate &quot; pinprickmg &quot; is absent there is plenty to dishearten good officers.
To sum up, omitting the purely Service considerations peculiar to each Province, the general conclusion that can be drawn from a perusal of these replies is that the pace and burden of work for all officers have unquestionably been increased by the introduction of Provincial Auto-autonomy, and especially in the Secretariat. The extent to which this increase is permanent is diffi-cult to judge and appears to depend largely on the ability of Ministers to show or acquire method and administrative capacity, and on the extent to which pressure from their supporters not only for immediate and far-reaching legislation, but also for attention to personal and petty matters can be controlled. But it is mainly in Congress Provinces, that, owing to the fundamental difference between the Congress conception of Government and that which obtained previously, to the more ambitious legislative programmes of Congress, and to the history of animosity between Congress and Government which still finds expression in a hostility to and mistrust of Government officers in certain quarters, the burden of work and the calls on the patience and goodwill of officers have become serious. The outlook for the future, and especially in the event of an emergency, is not reassuring. The majority of Governors, however, feel that with increased experience on the part of Ministers the present pressure will probably be reduced ; in the words of one Governor, &quot;it is not too extravagant a hope to expect that as time goes on Ministers themselves, who are the most over-worked of all, will pursue a more even path and will abandon-some of the methods which are at present making the task of administration more diffi-cult for Government officers &quot;.MSlOGHD 85-17-8-38 GlVB
