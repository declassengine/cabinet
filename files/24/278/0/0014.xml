THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1938.SECRET. Copy &quot;fro.CP. 179 (38).CABINET.MALTA.Memorandum, by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.ON the 15th June I brought before the Cabinet a memorandum [CP. 137 (38)) drawing attention to two questions which raised constitutional issues in Malta.The case of Strickland versus Sammut and A nother.2. The first question, namely, the situation created by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Malta, which held that the Letters Patent establishing the present Constitution were ultra vires, has now been disposed of, as the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Malta has been reversed on appeal to the Privy Council.Proposals for a Netv ConstiUt,tion.3. As regards the second question, the Cabinet have already at their meeting on the 15th June approved in principle the grant of a moi&apos;e liberal constitution to Malta, and in accordance with the decision then reached an announcement of His Majesty&apos;s Governments intention in this respect was made in reply to an arranged Parliamentary Question on the 11th July. I now submit for the consideration of my colleagues a statement of the main features of the new form of government which I propose that we should establish. This question has been the subject of long and careful discussion between the Governor and Lord Harlech in the first place, and myself subsequently; and the proposals made below have the full approval of the Governor.4. A return to self-government is not contemplated. The experience of the 1921 constitution has shown conclusively that the Maltese are still quite unfitted for any form of responsible government. I propose, therefore, to introduce representative, but not responsible, institutions, and that, with a view to fore-stalling local agitation, the announcement of the new constitution should be accompanied by a clear indication that the restoration of responsible self-govern-ment is not contemplated within any period of time which can at present be foreseen.5. Nevertheless the proposals below represent a considerable constitutional advance on the present Crown Colony Government of Malta. In my view the time is ripe for this; it is a good psychological moment to gain the greater loyalty of the Maltese by making a considerable political concession to them. It is five years since they were deprived of all participation in their own government. The interval has been spent in a constructive effort to counteract the disruptive influences of the violent party antagonisms and of the Italian propaganda and intrigue which marked the self-governing era. With tbis end in view the present Government has devoted itself not merely to providing a relief from internal strife, but to pursuing a vigorous policy of social and economic amelioi^ation. This policy has had a marked effect on the internal political situation. With the disappearance of the language question and of the prospect of office (neither of which will be revived under the new constitution) from the political sphere,[17625]
the old party animosities have cooled : public opinion has shown an increasing-appreciation of the advantages of stable and progressive administration : the social relations between the British and Maltese have noticeably improved; and, finally, anti-British influences are weaker than they have been for a very considerable time and are not now a substantial factor in the situation. It is in this atmosphere that the announcement of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;.? Gpyern-ment with regard to constitutional development will be made. The announcement is being eagerly awaited, and it is bound to play a large part in determining the political attitude of the Maltese for a considerable time to come. Bearing in mind the importance to Malta, as a fortress, of a loyal and contented civil population, there is evidently much to be said for so framing the new constitution as to secure the widest possible measure of popular support in the colony, and thereby to consolidate the gains of the past five years. The proposals outlined below have been designed with this purpose in view, and the Governor informs me that they are likely to satisfy the expectations of the great majority of the people.6. I propose that executive power should, as at present, be exercised by the Governor in Council. The existing Executive Council consists of official and unofficial members, and the question whether under the new constitution the Executive Council should contain some unofficial as well as the full complement of official members is one of detail which I should like authority to decide after further examination and consultation with the Governor.7. The participation of the people in the management of their own affairs will be secured by the establishment of a Legislature which will include in addition to a proportion of Government officials who will sit ex officio a number of unofficial members. I propose that this Legislature, to be called the Council of Government, should be composed of eight official members, two unofficial members nominated by the Governor and ten elected members. The Governor would preside and have a casting, but not an original, vote.8. This proposal involves the restoration of popular elections and the grant of an unofficial majority (but not an elected unofficial majority) in the Council. These concessions will, however, be accompanied by the following safeguards :  (a) All questions relating to the use of the Italian language will be excludedfrom discussion or control by the Legislature. Of all the issues which have divided the Maltese people the question of the Italian language, as opposed to English or&apos; Maltese, has probably been the most fruitful of discord and bitterness, and it is essential that no opportunity should be allowed to revive it.(b) The Governor will be given power in his absolute discretion, in the publicinterest, to control the discussion of any aspect of defence. The subject cannot be entirely excluded from the competence of the Council of Government as financial votes may be involved, but a discretion to refuse or to curtail discussion should provide an adequate safeguard.(c) The constitution will provide that certain classes of bills (for example,any bill affecting the constitution itself) shall not be assented to by the Governor, but shall be reserved for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure.(d) The Governor will have wide reserve powers which, in case of necessity,will enable him to ensure the passage of legislation which in his view is (to quote the usual formula) &quot; in the interests of public order, public faith, or other essentials of good government.&quot;9. The Governor has recommended that Roman Catholic clergy should be ineligible to sit in the Councibof Government. He regards this step as essential and I myself am strongly of opinion that in the interests of future good relations between the Government and the Church it is most undesirable that a priest should stand for election as a member of the Council. No provision excluding the clergy was, however, embodied in the 1921 constitution, and the attitude of the Church must therefore be doubtful. But the Governor has advised against prior discussion with the Church authorities on the subject, and he has stated that in his opinion a definite decision in favour of exclusion would receive the support of the main body of the clergy and the public, and that there is some
Colonial Office, July 22, 1938.reason to hope that it would receive the support also of ecclesiastical authorities in Malta. I would therefore propose to accept the Governors recommendation on this point, but, in order to avoid the appearance of discrimination, to extend the exclusion to all clergy of whatever denomination.10. It is proposed to retain the provisions regarding the franchise adopted for the Legislative Assembly in the 1921 constitution. Under these provisions the vote was granted to all male British subjects who-(1) were 21 years of age and upwards, and (2) were able to read and write, or(3) were in their own right or in the right of their wives in receipt from immovable property or other capital of an income of not less than  5 a year or paid an annual rent to that amount.Members of the naval, military and air forces were excluded unless possessing a legal domicile in Malta. The Governor has suggested that, with a view to improving the status of women in the colony, the vote might be conferred on unmarried women. But it seems to me that there are very great objections to such discrimination between married and unmarried women to the disadvantage of the former, and as the Governor has not felt able to recommend the enfranchise-ment of married women, on the ground that such a step would be strongly opposed to public opinion, I do.not propose to provide for any form of women&apos;s franchise in the new constitution. The matter is one which can appropriately be raised in the Council of Government at a later date.11. The official language of debate will be English : but any member will be allowed with the permission of the Governor to address the Council in Maltese, if the Governor is satisfied that he is unable to express himself adequately in English.12. It will not be possible to bring the new constitution into effect for some considerable time. I am informed that the preparations for the elections in Malta (the delimitation of constituencies and the compilation of the voters&apos; register, &amp;c.) will occupy a period of about nine months. It is, however, impor-tant, in order to forestall political agitation, that the main outlines of the new constitution should be announced at an early date. I therefore ask for the authority of the Cabinet (a) To proceed with the necessary steps to introduce a new constitution in malta on the lines indicated in paragraphs 6-11 in this memorandum.(b) To announce in Parliament the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto introduce a constitution on these lines.M.
