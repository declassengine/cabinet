We were appointed on the 29th June, 1938 (cabinet 30 (38)Conclusion 6) to &quot;consider and report on the results of tho conversations between the War Office and the India Office on the subject of the defence of India&quot;.2. We have already presented a short Interim Report(CP.  174 (38)) which was considered by the Cabinet on the20th July, 1938 (Cabinet 34 (38) Conclusion l).The Cabinet approved the first recommendation containedin our Interim Report, which was as follows:-&quot;That the War Office should be authorised to arrange for the transfer of four British infantry battalions from the Indian to the British establishment as soon as the necessary barrack accommodation is ready,,According to our present information,accommodation for two of the battalions will be available in April, 1939, and for the other two during the trooping-season 1939/40C&quot;The second recommendation of our Interim Report, namely that a Committee of Inquiry should proceed to India, was referred back to us by the Cabinet, and is dealt with in paragraphs 3,9-23 of the present Report.We are now in a position to lay   further recommendations before the Cabinet as a matter of extreme urgency.I^OCUIviENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC IviAJESTY1 S GOVERNIviEHT) .
91 7hi 1 63. Before our appointment the nmt-tfirj3__.wh.ichform our terms of reference had already Been examined in their military aspects by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee s whose Report (Paper l-To. CCS.  . 737), with its Annexes&quot;   is attached hereto as an Appendix.-We find ourselves in general agreement with the conclusions and recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee., as set oat in paragraph 50 of the Appendix.      In particular we are convinced that &quot;early action to place India&apos;s defence organisation on a more up-to-date and satisfactory basis is most essential&quot;.      In the paragraphs that follow, we set out the measures which we think should be taken at once to that end.Imperial Reserve       4. The Chiefs of Staff ,and the Government of IndiaDivision.were agreed that the latter&apos;- cot.l&amp;$ subject to certain conditions, maintain in India an Imperial Reserve Division which would include three British--and seven Indian Infantry Battalions, and   QOUid accept an unqualified commitment to place these troops at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom whensoever they might be called for,35 The Annexes to the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee are the following:-Annex 1 - Copy of a letter, dated February 9th, 1933, from the Secretary to the Government of India to the Secretary, Military Department, India Office-Annex 2 - Report of a Sub-Committee, under the chairmanship of Major-General H.R. Pownall, on the Defence Problems of India, and the Composition and Organisation of the Army and Royal Air Force in India.Annex 5 - Inter-Departmental Committee on Indian Defence Questions.      Financial Appreciation.Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Commi 11e e.
5.      T/e endorse this recommendation, subject to one -modification.    The Secretary of State for India has told us that there would he strong political and financial objections in India to any arrangement whereby India was called upon to share in maintaining a division v/hich was placed unreservedly at the disposal of the Home Government.    It would  he argued for example that the location of the Imperial Reserve Division: in India was arrangement at least as well suited to meet the strategical needs of the Empire as a whole as any other which could be devised,  and tnat the mere fact that it was so located was no reason why India shouldbe c ailed upon to pay any part of the bill.6,      Prom the United Kingdom point of view, on the other hand, it can be argued that the fact-that the division is  to be located in India will necessarily involve that India derives some benefit therefrom.    If, for example, circumstances should arise in which the division is needed for operations in., India itself, there can be no doubt that it wi 11 in fact be so employed.    To this extent the so-called unconditional liability may in practice be overridden by circumstances.
It can also be maintained that the defence of India is not a self-contained problem;    and that the Imperial Reserve Division, if sent outside India, will probably be employed, in large part at -least, in the defence of territories and fortresses which are essential to India&apos;s ultimate safety.7.      In addition, we may point out that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government were to assume the liability for the whole cost of the Imperial Reserve Division, the War Office would require direct financial and administrative control.     This might be difficult to reconcile with -the general Army arrangements in India.Unconditional 8.     To meet these difficulties, we recommend theobligation on government of following modification of the conception of anIndia:proposed Imperial.Reserve Division placed unreservedly andmodification.unconditionally at the disposal of the Home Govern-ment:-The division should be organised on thebasis proposed by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, with a view to its readiness to fulfil the functions assigned to it.      The degree of obligation on the Government of India to make the division available should be made somewhat more definite, and expressed more preciseljr, than is at present the case as regards reinforcements from India, but should fall short of an unconditional obligation.In recognition of this obligation (which would require to be presented in a manner which would bo acceptable to public opinion both here and in India), we consider that the Home Government would be justified in increasing the Garran grant-in-aid to a figure
vU substantially in excess of the sura which is atpresent fixed but short of the annual cost ofmaintenance of the Imperial Reserve Division.     We deal further- with this matter in paragraph 1 5 below.9* The  precise definition of the obligation which will rest on the Government of India if our recoramendation in the preceding paragraph is accepted might be left, we suggest, to be determined by the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State for War, in consultation, with the Chancel lor.--of --the &quot;Exchequers10.       The question arises whether the title &quot;Imperial Reserve Division&quot; will be appropriate, if the obligation on India is to fall short of an unconditional obligation.      In the view of the Secretars^ of State for India the title might in those circumstances be open to political objection,  and some such nomenclature as the &quot;First Field Division&quot; might be preferable.      The Secretary of State for War, on the other hand, considers that it will be essential that the title should indicate the Imperial functions assigned to the division. He points out that, if it were not for the performance of those functions, there would be no reason why this country should provide financial assistance towards the cost of the division.We consider that this question of nomenclature might be left to be settled in consultation between the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State for War.Royal Air 11.       The next matter to which we invite the attentionForce InIndia. of the Cabinet is the need for modernising the RoyalAir Force in India.     As is shown in the Report of
9 916 to 1. the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, the equipment ofthe Air Force in India is at the present time in a deplorable condition.      The aircraft with which it is equipped are of types which are no longer in production, and which cannot therefore be replaced. These obsolete1machines could not be employed in war against aircraft of modern designnThis is a situation which cannot be allowed to continue.     We deal further with this matter in paragraphs 16 and 17 below.Position of the 12,        It would not, of course, be absolutelyrest of theArmy in India.&apos; impossible to provide equipment and reserves for theImperial Reserve Division alone, while deferring expenditure on the modernisation of the rest of the British Army in India, but this course would lead to grave inconveniences.     Units in India must be transferred from the Imperial Reserve Division to other duties, and vice versa.      Further, the training of British units in India is already suffering and would continue to suffer severely, unless they were provided with equipment of the same type (though on a lower scale) as that issued to units in the proposed Imperial Reserve Division.We discuss this matter further in paragraphs 18 et seq... Finance. 13.       Turning now to the financial implications ofthe measures indicated in the preceding paragraphs^ we found ourselves confronted with an assurance from the Secretary of State for India that it is impossible both from the political and the financial point of view for Indian revenues to bear any

The difficulties of the situation have, however, heen eased hy certain offers which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has made,  subject to the approval of the Cabinet.Offers made by 14*       First,  the Chancellor has offered, as part ofthe Chancellorof the Exchequer,    a general arrangement,  to provide a sum not exceeding 5 millions to meet the capital cost of the equipment for the modernisation of the Imperial Reserve Division.15.       Secondly,  and again as part of a general arrangement,  the Chancellor of the Exchequer has offered to contribute towards the recurring maintenance costs of the Imperial Reserve Division, by increasing the Garran grant-in-aid to India by  500,000 a year,  i.e., from  1,500,000 to  2,000,000.Although the increase should logically begin to take effect from the time when the modernisation of the division is complete,  the Chancellor has indicated that, in order further to ease the situation for the Government of India,  he is willing that the increase should take effect from the 1st April,  1939.The Secretary of State for War has suggested that it would be desirable to consider the possibility of reducing this part of the Chancellor&apos;s offer to a formula, which could be applied to future variations in the maintenance costs of the Imperial Reserve Division.      We consider that this suggestion might be explored in consultation between the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State for War.

We consider that this suggestion might be explored in consultation between the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State for War.
99*3fvJ W &quot;16.        Thirdly, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has offered to provide the capital cost of the now aircraft required in order to re-equip the four existing Royal Air Force Bomber squadrons in India.He has made it clear, however, that Indian revenues, must be left to bear the cost of the consequential enlargement of aerodromes in India017.       We are informed that the total capital cost of the measures contemplated in the preceding paragraph will be some  3 millions.18.        The Chancellor of the Exchequer, as at present advised, is not prepared to suggest any financial contribution by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the modernisation of British units not forming part of the Imperial Reserve Division.    In his opinion the first step must be that there should be a detailed inquiry to show whether, and to what extent, it is practicable for a set off to be provided out of savings to be effected in the present cost of the Defence Forces in India.Proposal 19.        This brings us to the proposal made in our Interimfor aCommittee      Report (CP. 174 (38)) -of inquiry. &quot;That a Committee of Inquiry should proceedto India at an early date to consider and report whether savings can be made in existing Indian Defence expenditure to sot against the cost of modernisation of the Defence Forces in India, and in particular to meet increased future maintenance charges involved in that modernisation, and in the improved conditions of service&quot;.
20.It will be recalled that when this recommendation was discussed in Cabinet the Secretary of State for India took the view that the prop6sed Committee would be likely to weaken the position of the Government of India (more especially the Finance Member and the Commander-in^Chief), to make it difficult to resist the demand for more rapid Indianisation and to cause trouble in the development of Federation,,21.        The Secretary of State for India has now informed us that his original objections to the Committee of Inquiry have to a large extent been met5 particularly in view of the definite offers of finar.-cial assistance made by the Chancellor of the Exchequers The Secretary of State is of opinion, however,  (and we agree with him) that the most effective way of commending the inquiry to public opinion in India will be to arrange that the invitation to the Committee is issued by the Government of India and that it is made clear in its terms of reference that it is among the principal objects of the investigation to report on the best method of or&quot;gd.visdTig the Defence Forces in India, having regard to the contributions which are to be provided by the Home Exchequer0Cabinet will now endorse our recommendation for a Committee of Inquiry, of the character set out ir paragraph 19 abovec    We consider that this Committee should22.In these circumstances we trust that thebe appointed forthwith,,and should proceed to India as early as possible, witha view to reporting, &quot;if practicable, before theend of December nexto

At the request of the Secretary of State for India, we add a note of warning.    The Secretary of State informs us that the Government of India are unable to guarantee;  in order that budgetary equilibrium may be maintained,  that some immediate reductions in the Defence Forces in India may not become necessary, over and above the four British battalions dealt with in our Interim Report.    The reductions might affect British or Indian units,  or both0such reductions becoming imperative has not been altogether removed by the offers of financial assistance which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has made.The Secretary of State for India thinks itThe Secretaryof State fears that the danger of

Introduction.WE have been requested by the Secretaries of State for War, Air and India to consider in their defence aspects the following papers : 1(i) A letter, dated the 9th February, 1938, from the Government of Indiato the India Office (Annex No. 1). (ii) The Report of a Sub-Committee consisting of representatives of the War Office, the Air Ministry, the India Office and the Government of India, which was set up under the Chairmanship of Major-General H. R. Pownall &quot; to report on the defence problems of India, and to make recommendations for the future composition and organisation of both the Army and the Royal Air Force in India &quot; (Annex No. 2). (iii) A Financial Appreciation of the above papers prepared by an Inter- -departmental Committee consisting of representatives of the War Office, Air Ministry, India Office and Government of India (Annex No. 3).2. We are indebted to General Sir Ivo Vesey, Chief of the General Staff in India, and Air Marshal Joubert de la Ferte, Air Officer Commanding in India, who are at present on a deputation to England, and also to General Sir Sydney Muspratt, Secretary, Military Department, India Office, for having attended our meeting and given us the benefit of their experience of the present-day defence problems of India.Scope and arrangement of Report.3. Except for an annexed statement in which it is estimated that &apos;&apos; measures affecting the Royal Indian Navy only &quot; will cost 9-85 lakhs of rupees, the letter from the Government of India makes little or no reference to the naval aspect of India&apos;s defence problems. Nor do the estimates of expenditure given in the Financial Appreciation (Annex No. 3) allow for any increased costs on account of the expansion of the Royal Indian Navy.
4. Until very recently, the Government of India has, under a long-standing arrangement, paid a direct contribution of  100,000 a year to His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the naval defence of India and the protection of trade in Indian waters. The Government of India has also defrayed miscellaneous charges amounting to  15,000- 20,000 per annum on behalf of vessels of. the Royal Navy. Recently, however, an agreement was concluded between the two Governments under the terms of which His Majesty&apos;s Government are to forgo these annual payments, on condition that the Government of India maintain&apos; a sea-going fleet of not less than six modern escort vessels, which will be free to co-operate with the Royal Navy for the defence of India, and, in addition, fulfil their responsibility for the local naval defence of Indian ports. We are informed that the above measures are likely to involve the Government of India in larger expenditure than was anticipated, and that the whole matter is now under consideration by the Government Departments concerned. Since, however, there is little more than a passing reference to naval defence in any of the documents that have been specifically referred to us, we have excluded this important aspect of India&apos;s defence problems from the scope of our Report. Nevertheless, it is clear that it should be taken into account in any comprehensive arrangement which may be reached in the matter of defence expenditure between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India.5. Our observations on the three documents referred to us are set out in Sections II, III and IV respectively of this Report.II. Government of India Letter of the 9th February, 1938 (Annex No. 1).6. The Government of India letter was written before the conclusion of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, and before Japan was heavily committed in China. In the present condition of the world, we entirely agree that the situation demands a &quot; redetermination* of lndia&apos;s defence problem in both its military and financial aspects.&quot; The defence of India can no longer be considered as a self-contained problem.7. The military aspects of the letter of the Government of India are analysed in,, and covered by the Pownall Sub-Committee Report (Annex No. 2)i We therefore think that it will be a convenient arrangement, and obviate repetition.if we reserve our comments thereon to Section III.8. Similarly, the financial aspects of the letter, in so far as they may be thought to lie in our province, are summarised in the Financial Appreciation (Annex No. 3); and we therefore reserve our comments thereon to Section IV.III.-The Report of the Pownall Sub-Committee.9. The conclusions of the Pownall Sub-Committee may be summarised as follows : (i) India should reduce her establishments by four British battalions, which should be placed at the disposal of the War Office to meet its urgent requirements.&apos; (ii) India should place at the unqualified disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, as potential reinforcements for the Middle and Far East, in an emergency, one Mixed Division, with ancillary units, to be treated as an Imperial Reserve and to be located in India.(iii) An increase in the Royal Air Force in India by 1\ Bomber Transport Flights is necessary if that service is to be fully adequate to meet the requirements of India&apos;s local defence. This would result in a total strength of : 6 Bomber Squadrons.3 Army Co-operation Squadrons.1 Bomber Transport Squadron.
(iv) A further increase of four squadrons will be necessary if India&apos;s air contribution to existing plans of Imperial defence in the Middle and Far East is to be other than a contingent liability, (v) The complete modernisation of the Division mentioned in (ii) above, and the modernisation on a lower scale of the remainder of the Army in India.(vi) The modernisation of the whole of the Royal Air Force in India isessential.(vii) India&apos;s defence problems should be more closely co-ordinated with ourown, and, from this point of view, the higher direction of defence matters in India should be brought more into line with the system in force in London.10. In the paragraphs that follow we examine the above conclusions, and the principal arguments which have led up to them.Indians Imperial defence commitments.11. The Pownall Sub-Committee define the starting-point of the problem in the following terms : &quot; 61. The changed strategical situation throughout the world and the development of modern armaments, particularly air forces, have brought into prominence the need for India, in her own interest, to play a more important part in the defence of the vital areas on our Imperial communications in the Middle and Far East.62. India is the area, strategically best suited east of the Mediterranean basin for the location of the bulk of the immediate strategic reserves, together with their sources of supply; moreover, in present circumstances, and as far ahead as can be foreseen, the forces maintained in India are the only sources from which it may be possible to find these reserves.....&quot;12. It will be recalled that the plans which we have recently prepared to meet various war contingencies, and which have received the approval of the Committee of Imperial Defence, are based on the assumption that army* and airt reinforcements will in the event of necessity be immediately despatched from India. Accordingly, we have no hesitation in endorsing the Pownall Sub-Committee^ conception of the essence of India&apos;s problem in relation to Imperial Defence.13. In order to ensure that the land forces included in the above reinforce-ments may at all times be available for Imperial purposes, the Pownall Sub-Committee reach the following conclusion (Annex No. 2, paragraph 63) : &quot; Subject to the acceptance, in the wider interests of Imperial defence as a whole, of a defensive policy on land in the event of war with Afghanistan (and despite its strategic disadvantages), we agree that, as far as the Army is concerned, the Government of India would be able to meet the requirements of India&apos;s own local defence, even if they released four British battalions for service elsewhere in peace, and accepted an unqualified commitment to provide one division as an Imperial strategic reserve to meet commitments outside India in all circumstances.The acceptance by the Government of India of this reduction of forces should, however, be subject to the condition that a certain measure of modernization of the Army in India is undertaken with resultant increase in its fire-power and mobility. We agree that the Imperial Reserve Division should be made available for employment under the orders of the Government of India in an emergency if not required elsewhere.&quot;14. If an Imperial emergency were to synchronise with a war against Afghanistan, it would probably be the correct strategy to adopt, in the latter theatre, a generally defensive attitude with land forces, and, as a set-off, to use our air forces on as vigorous and. sustained an offensive as possible. If on the other hand we were to become involved in war with Afghanistan without risk of complications elseAvhere, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would probably be able to agree to the suggestion that the Imperial Reserve* Annex No. 2, paragraph 37. t Annex No. 2, paragraph 40:
Division should be made available for employment under the orders of the Government of India. There is admittedly a definite risk that, once permission had been given for the employment of this division in operations beyond the Frontier, it might be difficult to extricate it for employment in any other theatre of war. It is impossible to define in advance the conditions in which His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to run the risk of committing the Imperial Reserve Division in Afghanistan; we consider, however, that in certain circumstances this is a risk which might have to be accepted15. We therefore endorse the general conception underlying the passage quoted in paragraph 13, and in particular the recommendation that the Govern-ment of India should accept an unqualified commitment to provide one division as an Imperial strategic reserve to meet commitments outside India in all circumstances.The Modernization of the forces in India.16. Since the forces earmarked as Imperial reinforcements will in most cases be opposed by forces of a first-class military Power, it is essential that they should be equipped on a scale which will enable them to meet the enemy on level terms.17. Moreover, as the Pownall Sub-Committee point out (Annex No. 2, para-graph 62), it is most important in the interests of effective co-operation that these reinforcements should be &quot; organised and equipped on the same lines as the Imperial Forces alongside whom they will have to fight in war.&quot;Army.18. The modernisation of the Imperial Reserve Division on the lines contemplated in the preceding paragraph would automatically necessitate a degree of modernisation for the remainder of the Army in India for the following reasons : (i) To compensate for the reduction in India&apos;s own military strength consequent upon the transfer to the War Office of 4 battalions and the relinquishment of one division to form an Imperial Reserve, (ii) To provide uniformity of organisation and training in India and to enable interchanges to take place between units of the Imperial Reserve Division and the rest of the Army in India.(iii) To avoid the necessity, which would otherwise arise, of re-trainingBritish Army units and personnel on leaving India to fit them to take their place in other garrisons or to be called up on mobilisation.(iv) To make it possible for units, British and Indian, in addition to those inthe Imperial Reserve Division, to be drawn upon in the early stages of another war should events demand such a course. In this connection it is relevant to recall what occurred in 1914.19. We therefore consider that the Army in India, other than the Imperial Reserve Division, should have at least sufficient modern equipment for the above purposes. The Chief of the General Staff, India, told us that this policy was the one which the Government of India had in view.A ir Force.20. In paragraphs 16-19 above we have discussed the question of the modernisation of the whole of the land forces of India. The arguments put forward in paragraph 18 apply, mutatis mutandis, with equal force to the whole of the Royal Air Force in India. But in this case there are additional considerations.21. The present situation of the Royal Air Force in India is set out at some length in the Pownall Report (Annex No. 2, paragraphs 34 and 35), and it is mentioned, inter alia, that about three squadrons of the Afghan Air Force are equipped with relatively up-to-date aircraft, &quot; including types of considerably superior performance to any now existing in the Royal Air Force in India.&quot;
22. It is clear, therefore, that, even if the strength of the Air Forces main-tained in India will only permit a conditional commitment to provide Air reinforcements for overseas contingencies, the modernisation of the whole of the Royal Air Force in India is imperatively necessary in both Imperial and Indian interests.The present situation of Indians land and air forces.A rmy.23.   To quote from the Government of India letter* &apos;&apos; The measures thought to be essential to the modernisation of the Army in India, if not more urgent, are more numerous and varied in scope than those proposed for the Royal Air Force in India. The following measures are illustrative of the sort of deficiency which now exists in Indians Defence Scheme ....(i) The provision of adequate reserves of Ordnance and Engineer Stores.(ii) The mechanisation and rearmament of the Field Artillery.(iii) The acquisition and installation of the necessary machinery to enablethe Ordnance Factories to reach their required war output within the specified period.Considerable risks which can no longer be justified have been taken in in the past and are being taken at present by allowing stocks of Ordnance and Engineer stores of all kinds to remain below the minimum level considered essential in the event of general mobilisation becoming necessary.&quot;Air Force.24. The air force in India is in an even worse position. As regards its strength we must emphasise the point commented upon by the Pownall Sub-Committee (Annex No. 2, paragraph 65) as to &quot; The marked disparity between the capacity of India&apos;s land forces and that of her air forces as at present existing to meet the requirements of her own local defence and at the same time to provide reinforcements for vital areas overseas.&quot; It is clear that unless the four squadrons mentioned in paragraph 9 (iv) above are added to the strength of the air force in India, we can never rely upon obtaining from India the essential air reinforce-ments for which at present India has only accepted a contingent liability.In addition, we must draw attention tot the fact, mentioned in para-graph 33 (iii) of the Pownall Report, that the revised plan of operations against Afghanistan consequent upon the unconditional release of the Imperial Reserve Division &quot;is likely to involve considerable additional demands on the air forces in India.&quot;In equipment the air force also is seriously inadequate. To quote again the Government of India&apos;s letter! &apos;&apos; The Royal Air Force in India is equipped at present with bomber and Army Co-operation aircraft of obsolete types which, though efficient enough in operations against the tribes of the unadministered tracts of the North-West Frontier, could not hope to hold their own against aircraft of modern design, e.g., against Italian or Japanese aircraft, should they be called upon to assist in the defence of Imperial interests in the Middle or Far East.&quot;25. It is abundantly clear from the above that neither the Army nor Air Force in India are at present in any shape to discharge many of the Imperial commitments which, in certain circumstances, they may be called upon to meet. Their position is, in fact, not less deplorable than was the position in this country before rearmament was approved.26. The Chief of the General Staff in India, in the course of the evidence which he gave at our meeting, described the grave results of allowing the present state of affairs to continue in the following terms : (i) The present expenditure upon the defence forces in India (about  34,000,000 a year) would, so far as Imperial, as distinct from Indian, defence was concerned, be practically nugatory.
(ii) India would be compelled to reduce additional British units to meetthe increased cost of the remainder.   The alternative to disbanding these units (a course which was in present circumstances unthinkable on military and also, it is to be imagined, on political grounds) was to add them to garrisons outside India, (iii) The reductions thus made would result in the Defence force falling below the minimum necessary for the adequate protection of British lives and interests in India.  This, in itself, would render it impossible to make available reinforcements in an Imperial Emergency.   More-over, they would not, in any case, have been trained or equipped to the required standard, (iv) British troops and air forces, on completing their tour in India, would have to be re-trained before they were fit to take their place in other garrisons or before they could be used in war. (v) India might well become a serious additional commitment, instead of an asset, in the event of a major war.27. If, on the other hand, the proposals of the Government of India could be implemented, the picture, as painted by Sir Ivo Vesey in the following language, would be a very different one :  (i) India would be able to provide a modernised division for Imperialneeds, and at the same time meet the requirments of her oavii local defence.(ii) Provided the situation in India permitted, she would be able to providefour up-to-date R.A.F. squadrons for service overseas.(iii) The Defence Force as a whole would be of a suitable type to furnishfurther reinforcements in an Imperial emergency.(iv) With certain exceptions, India would be self-contained as regardssupply of warlike stores; she might, moreover, be able materially to assist other members of the Eastern groups of Imperial garrisons with regard to supply.28. We cannot but attach great weight to the above expression of opinion; and we share the conviction of the Government of India &quot;that early action to place the country&apos;s Defence Organisation on a more up-to-date and satisfactory footing is essential.&quot;Measures for the Modernisation of the Defence Forces in India.29. The measures which the Government of India consider immediately necessary are specified in the statement attached to their letter (Enclosure to Annex No. 1). In the short time available, and in the absence of detailed knowledge of Indian conditions, we cannot do more than record the view that, generally speaking, these proposals seem to us to be reasonable, and that they should be implemented with as little delay as possible.30. For the same reasons we are unable to advise as to the order of priority in which this should be done. It would, however, be consistent with what is being done at Home, if India were to concentrate in the first instance on those measures which can be brought to fruition within the next two critical years.31. We invite attention to the question of principle which is implicit in the desire of the Government of India to decrease &apos;&apos; to the greatest extent possible the dependence of India on the United Kingdom for the supply of munitions of war,&quot;* and to the measures which she proposes to take to that end.32. The Chief of the General Staff in India told us that if the necessary funds were made available, a large proportion of India&apos;s war requirements could be produced in India itself, and that in addition India might be able materially to assist other members of the Eastern groups of Imperial garrisons with regard to supply. This immensely valuable contribution to Imperial Defence would be in complete accord with the recommendationst of the Munitions and Food Supplies Committee at the Imperial Conference of 1937.
33.   Further we desire to comment on the following concluding paragraph of the Pownall Sub-Committee Report: &quot;66. Finally, India cannot make the necessary provision for her security in all contingencies for instance, in the event of aggression by a major Power without Imperial assistance. On the other hand, India&apos;s contribution is vitally important to Imperial defence as a whole.It is evident, therefore, that the defence of India cannot be considered as a self-contained problem.&quot;We consider it very desirable, therefore, that the machinery of the Committee of Imperial Defence should be more fully utilised for the purpose of co-ordinating the defence of India with the defence of the Empire as a whole.We understand that some advance has been made in India towards bringing the higher direction of defence matters more into line with the system in force in London. We attach great importance to further develop-ments in this direction.&quot;34.   Our own plans to meet some of the eventualities with which we may be confronted depend, as has been stated in paragraph 12 on the immediate despatch of reinforcements from India.     Conversely, it is recognised that in certain circumstances, &amp;.g., a Russian violation of the integrity of Afghanistan, . the despatch to India of Imperial reinforcements would be imperative.   In these j circumstances, we entirely endorse the opinion that the plans of the two countries j should be closely and systematically co-ordinated.35. There is, of course, already a measure of such co-ordination. The Secretary of State for India and the Secretary, Military Department, India Office, are on the permanent panel of the Committee of y Imperial Defence. All Committee of Imperial Defence papers which affect India, together with the Minutes of the Meetings at which these papers have been discussed, are regularly transmitted to India. Indian interests are represented on various Sub-Com-mittees of the Committee of Imperial Defence, notably the Principal Supply Officers Committee, and the Middle East Sub-Committee. In addition there is a Standing Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence under the Chair-manship of the Secretary of State for India entitled the Defence of India Sub-Committee; but this has not met for some time.36. In India itself the system and organisation of the Committee of Imperial Defence have already been adopted in certain respects. There is, for example, a Principal Supply Officers Committee Organisation in India, on the Home model which keeps in close touch with its counterpart in this country; there is an Indian War Book modelled and based on the United Kingdom War Book; and so forth. In addition, Sir Ivo Vesey informed us that a Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, which includes the Admiral Commanding the Royal Indian Navy, has recently been established. This Committee, however, is not a parallel organisa-tion to the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.37. All these arrangements are in the right direction. But we submit that they do not go far enough. For example, India&apos;s plans of operations to meet the contingency of war with Afghanistan have hitherto been treated as purely the domestic concern of the Government of India. They have never been examined or approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence, notwithstanding the fact that they could not be implemented without the consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.38. These questions of bringing the defence problems of India more under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and of the modernisation of the system of higher direction of defence matters in India raise constitutional and political issues which we realise are outside our province. There are, however, important defence implications. In particular, we think that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government should decide to make any contribution towards the cost of the defence measures, which the Government of India propose in their letter (Annex No. 1), a closer co-ordination with and control of Indian defence should be an integral feature of any new &quot; contract &quot; which may be made. In this connection the Chief of the Air Staff is of opinion that the Royal Air Force in India, in view of the responsibility and status of that Service, not only in
relation to Indian defence but in Imperial defence generally, can no longer be treated as an ancillary to the Army in India. We therefore submit that these aspects of the problem should be included in the orbit of the further enquiry which we assume will have to be instituted as the result of this report.39. We also consider that in defence interests, the suggestion in para-graph 59 (6) of the Pownall Report, that the air force in India should be administered and equipped by the Air Ministry on an agency basis, deserves the most detailed expert examination.IV. The Financial Appreciation (Annex No. 3).40. In the Financial Appreciation prepared by the Inter-departmental Committee on India Defence questions (Annex No. 3), the capital expenditure involved in the measures proposed by the Government of India is estimated at  29,217,000, and the total recurring expenditure at  4,240,000 per annum (over and above the normal Indian defence budget of approximately  34 million).41. The Government of India say tljat they can make no contribution to either the capital or the recurring cost of their proposals, and that, &quot; unless the necessary money is forthcoming, India will have no alternative but to do the best she can with the 44^ crores a year which is all that she is likely to be able to make available for defence purposes. &quot;*42. This raises very wide political and financial issues which are clearly outside our province. We desire, however, to make certain observations of a general character, which should, we suggest, be brought to the notice of whatever body is called upon to undertake the detailed examination of the proposals of the Government of India in all their aspects.43. In the first place, we do not for a moment desire to detract from the urgency of India&apos;s defence problem, or to minimise the serious risks to both Indian and Imperial interests of allowing the present state of affairs to continue. Nevertheless, we have no hesitation in recording the view that the situation in India should not be restored at the expense of our own rearmament programme. Indeed the modernization of the forces in India is an essential element within the reorganization of our military forces as a whole. On this subject the Secretary of State for War stated t : ;&quot; Until decisions have been reached, there can be no satisfactory redistribution of the British Army as a whole in accordance with present strategic needs, nor can there be, in accordance with the same needs, a suitable reorganization of the rest of the Army.&quot;44. Secondly, if it should be decided to accept the offer of the Government of India to undertake an unconditional commitment to provide properly equipped reinforcements for vital areas overseas and from the military point of view it is eminently desirable that this offer should be accepted it seems only equitable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should bear a proportion of the expenditure involved. We would point out, however, that some of the measures which the Government of India consider to be essential for the modernisation of their defence Forces cannot by any stretch of imagination be said to be occasioned by their Imperial defence obligations. There is, for example, an item of  1 million (capital) and  x million (recurring) on account of A.A. Defence.45. Thirdly, we wish to draw attention to the possibility that some of the new measures mentioned in paragraphs 23 and 24 now proposed might be financed by savings in other directions out of the existing Indian defence budget. In the absence of detailed information of Indian conditions, we ourselves are not able to advise in this matter; but we are inclined to think, on general grounds, that there should be certain directions in which a reduction of existing defence expenditure in India might be possible.46. Sir Ivo Vesey told us, for example, that in the modified plan of operations against Afghanistan (see paragraph 13 above), it was contemplated that any advance beyond the frontier on the Southern line would be of a strictly* Annex No. 1, paragraph 29.f CP. 26 (38), paragraph 15; also Enclosure to Paper No. D.P. (P.) 17.
9limited character. Accordingly, we are not convinced of the necessity for the retention of sixteen Horsed Cavalry Regiments in India. At the same time, it is only fair to mention that Sir Ivo Vesey told us that His Excellency the Commander-in-chief in India was now considering an extension of the present programme of conversion of a proportion of Cavalry Regiments to mechanised units. He added that Sir Robert Cassels was opposed to any &quot; snap &quot; decision on this point for two reasons, In the first place, the general policy as regards mechanisation was still in the melting-pot, even at Home; and secondly, even if India were to decide to mechanise further Cavalry Regiments forthwith, there would not be the slightest chance of getting equipment for them for some considerable time. We are, however, not convinced that a case has been made out for the retention of sixteen Cavalry Regiments whether mechanised or horsed, nor are we clear as to how the further mechanisation of the Indian cavalry is to be financed.47. Again we are not convinced, having regard to the operations which the forces in India are likely to be called upon to undertake, that it is essential for them to retain eight Brigades of Field Artillery over and above the Artillery for the Imperial Reserve Division. The Chief of the General Staff in India told us, however, that the defence authorities in India regarded these eight Field Brigades as a minimum requirement. He added that the third section of field batteries had already been eliminated, and that the peace establishment of the artillery, in India would be ultimately reduced by 900-1,000 other ranks.48. As stated in paragraph 45 above, we ourselves are not in a position to advise as to whether reductions could or could not be made. At the same time, we think that there is a case for a detailed review of the position with which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would no doubt wish to be associated, if the provision of financial assistance to the Government of India is to be a feature of any new &quot;contract&quot; which may be made. We think that it should be stipulated in any such &quot; contract &quot; that the precise extent of the financial assistance, to be afforded to the Government of India by His Majesty&apos;s Government should be susceptible to adjustment in the light of the results of the joint review.49. In conclusion we would strongly urge that the measures considered necessary for the modernisation of the defence forces in India should be approved in principle and some action to implement them be taken without further delay.50.   Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as follows : (a) The question of the measures affecting the Royal Indian Navy should be taken into account in any comprehensive arrangement which may be reached in the matter of defence expenditure between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India (paragraph 4).(&amp;) The defence of India can no longer be considered as. a self-contained jDroblem and demands re-determination (paragraph 6).(c) We endorse the general conception underlying the following conclusion of the Pownall Committee (paragraph 13)-:  &quot; Subject to the acceptance, in the wider interests of Imperial Defence as a whole, of a defensive policy on land in the event of war with Afghanistan (and despite its strategic disadvantages), we agree that, as far as the army is concerned, the Government of India would be able to meet the requirements of India&apos;s own local defence, even if they released four British battalions for service elsewhere in peace, and accepted an unqualified commitment to provide one division as an Imperial strategic reserve to meet commitments outside India in all circumstances.The acceptance by the Government of India of this reduction of forces should, however, be subject to the conditions that a certain measure of modernisation of the Army in India is undertaken with the resultant increase in its fire-power and mobility. We agree that the Imperial Reserve Division should be made available for employ-ment under the orders of the Government of India in an emergency if not required elsewhere.&quot;V. Conclusions and Recommendations.
(d) The forces earmarked as Imperial reinforcements should be equipped ona scale which will enable them to meet a first-class enemy, and in the interests of effective co-operation, on the same lines as the Imperial forces (paragraphs 16 and 17).(e) The modernisation of the Imperial Reserve Division would automaticallynecessitate a degree of modernisation for the remainder of the Army in India (paragraphs 18 and 19). (/) The modernisation of the whole of the Royal Air Force in India is imperatively  necessary   in   both   Imperial  and   Indian  interests (paragraph 22).(g) Unless four squadrons are added to the strength of the Air Force inIndia, the despatch of essential air reinforcements from India must remain a contingent liability (paragraph 24).(h) Neither the Army nor Air Force in India are at present in any shape todischarge many of their Imperial commitments. Early action to place India&apos;s defence organisation on a more up-to-date and satisfactory footing is therefore most essential (paragraphs 25-28).(i) The measures for the modernisation of the defence forces in India,specified in the Government of India&apos;s letter (Enclosure to Annex No. 1), appear to be reasonable, and should be implemented with as little delay as possible (paragraph 29).(j) The proposal of the Government of India to decrease to the greatest extent possible her dependence on the United Kingdom for the supply of munitions of war would be a valuable contribution to Imperial Defence (paragraphs 30-32).(k) The defence problems of India should be more closely co-ordinated with those of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and the existing system in India for the higher direction of defence matters should be the subject of detailed examination (paragraph 38).(I) The suggestion that the Air Force in India should be administered and equipped by the Air Ministry on an &quot; agency basis &quot; deserves expert examination (paragraph 39). im) The situation in India should not be restored at the expense of our own Re-armament Programme (paragraph 43).(n) We are not in a position to advise as to whether a proportion of the expenditure now contemplated could or could not be met by savings out of the existing Indian Defence Budget. We think, however, that there is a case for a detailed review of the position with which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should be associated (paragraphs 45-48).(o) The measures considered necessary for the modernisation of the Defence forces in India should be approved in principle and some action to implement them be taken Avithout further delay.(Signed) CHATFIELD.C.

ANNEX No.  1.Copy of a letter, dated February 9, 1938, from the Secretary to the Government of India to the Secretary, Military Department, India Office.[No. 42138/1/G.S-S.D.2.]Modernization of the Defence Forces in India.$fc -fa ^I am directed to address you on the subject of the modernization of the defence forces in India, and their preparedness for war. The Secretary of State already has some knowledge of this matter, but the Government of India consider that a detailed restatement of India&apos;s Defence Policy and of what is now required for its fulfilment should be made available for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. India differs from the self-governing Dominions in the matter of defence, and the constitutional position under the Act of 1919, which was clearly stated in paragraph 202&apos; of the Report of the Royal Commission, has undergone no substantial change of principle, though it has been modified as a result of the Report of the Garran Tribunal issued in January 1933.In their report the Tribunal accepted the view that at that time &quot;. . . . the scale on which the military forces in India are maintained in respect of the numbers, composition, equipment, &amp;c, is no greater than is required for the defence of India and the maintenance of internal security. . . .The duties of the Army in India include the preservation of internal security in India, the covering of the lines of internal communication and the protection of India against external attack. Though the scale of the forces is not calculated to meet external attack by a great power, their duties might well comprise the initial resistance of such an attack pending the arrival of Imperial reinforcements.&quot;3. At the time of the publication of the Garran Report the international situation was very different from that now obtaining. Italy had not conquered Abyssinia; she was not threatening our position in the Mediterranean, nor had she attempted, as she is now doing, to establish her influence in Afghanistan. Japan had not embarked on the conquest of China, nor had she openly displayed, as she has since done, her apparently fixed intention to oust British interests from China. Germany had not made any appreciable progress in the expansion and re-equipment of her defence forces, and the triple entente between Germany, Italy and Japan had not materialized.These basic and far-reaching changes, coupled with the question of the supply of munitions referred to in paragraph 4 below, have necessarily affected the defence problems of India to an extent which calls for definite measures to be undertaken as early as possible. It is impossible to ignore the fact that India is likely, in the future, to be called upon to accept wider overseas commitments in the interests of Imperial Defence. India is also taking steps to implement her liability for the close defence of her ports; this implies the allotment, for this particular purpose, of land and air forces as well as sea forces, and the provision of special armaments and equipments such as coast defence artillery, anti-aircraft guns and aeroplanes, provided with the necessary means for locating and, if necessary, attacking hostile ships at sea. Moreover, the Royal Indian Navy is being re-equipped and reorganized to enable it to operate with the Royal Navy. The above considerations unquestionably indicate the pressing need for organizing and equipping a part, at any rate, of India&apos;s defence forces on a standard which has not hitherto been envisaged.4. Inseparably connected with the increasing likelihood of India&apos;s defence forces becoming involved in operations against a first-class power, is the question of the supply of munitions to enable them adequately to play their part in such operations. India, though unlikely ever to become wholly self-supporting in this respect, can even to-day provide a large proportion of her own requirements. For instance, she makes her own field and mountain artillery equipments as well [17443] d
as rifles and light machine guns, though admittedly dependent on exterior sources for much of the raw material necessary for their manufacture. She also makes much of the clothing, saddlery and equipment required by the Army in India, as well as practically all her small arms ammunition and most of her artillery ammunition, though the high explosive required for the latter has to be imported from the United Kingdom in common with her requirements in aeroplane bombs.Ships and other warlike stores for the Royal Indian Navy, aircraft for the Royal Air Force in India and equipments for the heavy, medium and anti-aircraft artillery required by the Army in India have to be obtained from the United Kingdom.In respect of the supply of foodstuffs for the needs of her defence forces, India is practically self-supporting, but all motor vehicles and machinery required by these forces have to be imported from abroad as there is no indigenous manufacture.It has become apparent that the strain which will be placed upon the resources of the United Kingdom in the production of stores and munitions required to meet her own needs in time of war will be such that India cannot rely to any appreciable extent upon that source of supply to meet the requirements of her own defence forces.-This, coupled with the practical certainty that, in the event of war with Italy, the sea communications between India and the United Kingdom will be liable to Serious interruption has brought home to the Government of India the urgency of the need for decreasing to the greatest extent possible the dependence of India on the United Kingdom for the supply of munitions of war.5. Having carefully considered the recent changes in the world situation in relation to their effect on the defence of the Empire in general and the defence of India in particular, and also the position of India in respect of her require-ments in warlike stores which cannot be produced in India, the Government of India is convinced that early action to place the country &apos;s defence organisation on a more up-to-date and satisfactory footing is essential.6. It is convenient at this point to recapitulate the several liabilities which have been accepted for the Defence Forces of India. Briefly, these are as follows(i) The defence of her land frontiers against aggression by a second-classpower;(ii) Initial operations with existing forces to protect her land frontiersagainst aggression by a first-class power, pending the arrival of Imperial reinforcements; (iii) The close defence of her coast line against sea-borne attack;(iv) Assistance to the civil power in the maintenance of internal law andorder; and(v) The provision in emergency, if the situation in India permits, ofassistance in the general defence of the Empire and its communica-tions.It is to be noted that more than one of these liabilities may have to be liquidated simultaneously.7. The measures considered necessary to enable the defence forces adequately to perform the tasks enumerated above are many and costly as. a reference to the appendix to this letter will show. It is not intended to discuss each item of this list in detail, but it will not be out of place here briefly to consider the nature and urgency of some of the more important of these measures.In the following paragraphs the more pressing needs of the defence services are considered separately : 8. The Royal Air Force in India is equipped at present with bomber and army co-operation aircraft of obsolete types which, though efficient enough in operations against the tribes of the unadministered tracts of the North-West Frontier, could not hope to hold their own against aircraft of modern design, e.g., against Italian or Japanese aircraft, should they be called upon to assist in the defence of Imperial interests in the Middle or Far East. In this connection, the future possibility of land-based air attack by Japan, from bases in Western China, against Burma and the Gangetic Delta cannot be ignored.
The necessity for replacing these obsolete aircraft by the most suitable modern types available cannot be exaggerated, and may well be said to take precedence over all other proposals, however urgent they may be, for the modernisation of India&apos;s defence forces. Another hardly less urgent necessity for the placing of the air force on an efficient footing is the provision of an adequate reserve of bombs, or, alternatively, the erection of a factory to manufacture these bombs in India. Other important needs are the provision of adequate reserves of ground and air equipment and the acquisition of sufficient bomber transport aircraft to render the army co-operation and bomber squadrons sufficiently mobile to enable them to meet the numerous calls likely to be made upon them in war. The total cost of the measures considered necessary for the modernisation of the Royal Air Force in India is estimated to be not less than 443 lakhs of rupees, or about  3,324,450.9. The measures thought to be essential to the modernisation of the Army in India, if not more urgent, are more numerous and varied in scope than those proposed for the Royal Air Force in India.The following measures are illustrative of the sort of deficiency which now exists in India&apos;s defence scheme, although their selection for comment in the body of this letter is not necessarily an index of their urgency relatively to other measures in the list enclosed(i) The provision of adequate reserves of ordnance and engineer stores.(ii) The mechanisation and rearmament of the field artillery.(iii) The acquisition and installation of the necessary machinery to enable the ordnance factories to reach their required war output within the specified period.Considerable risks, which can no longer be justified, have been taken in the past and are being taken at present by allowing stocks of ordnance and engineer stores of all kinds to remain below the minimum level considered essential in the event of general mobilisation becoming necessary. The uncertainty of the world situation to-day and the increasing liability of Imperial communications to inter-ruption by hostile action has made it impossible to continue to accept the present position in respect of reserves of stores held in India. The cost of completing these reserves is roughly estimated to be 126 lakhs of rupees, or about  945,000.The wholesale mechanization of the artillery in the United Kingdom has made it impossible to procure trained drivers for horsed artillery units in India, and the training of these drivers after their arrival in this country to ride and look after horses is not a practical proposition. The mechanization of the field artillery has thus been forced upon us by developments at home. The guns and howitzers with which the field artillery in India is armed at present are obsolete and of a type which cannot be converted, and, in comparison with those in use in modern armies, deficient in range and hitting power. If, as has already been contemplated, it should become necessary to reinforce Egypt with field artillery from India, it would stand little chance of competing successfully with the modern weapons likely to be brought into the field by the Italians. The cost of this measure will be in the nature of 275 lakhs of rupees, or about  2,062,500.The need for the installation of the necessary machinery to enable India&apos;s ordnance factories to reach their required war output hardly needs elaboration. The need is particularly pressing in respect of machinery for the production of machine guns and of spare parts for these weapons which are no longer obtainable from the United Kingdom. This measure is estimated to cost about 40 lakhs of rupees, or  300,000.10. There are other pressing and important measures which affect all three of the defence services.Prominent amongst them are : (i) The provision of anti-gas equipment and clothing and other means ofpassive protection against air attack, (ii) The organization of coast defences at the important ports.(iii) The installation of factories to provide the high explosive needed forartillery shells and aircraft bombs and for the manufacture of the bombs themselves. &apos;. &apos;
The ever-increasing speed and range of aircraft has exposed a large area of the Indian Empire to the risk of hostile air attack. It is true that the threat of attacks on a large scale from the air against this country cannot be said to be imminent, but it grows greater every year, and measures to meet it must be taken in good time, since they cannot be improvised at short notice. The moral and material effects which a successful air raid is likely to have on an undeveloped and uneducated country such as India need no emphasis. The extent to which India is at present considered to be vulnerable to air attack is shown in the attached map.*The provision of adequate protection against air attack in general and air-borne gas attacks in particular is considered to be unavoidable. The cost of the provision of the necessary protection is estimated at about 250 lakhs of rupees, or  1,875,000.India has accepted the responsibility for the coast defence of her leading ports, which include Bombay, Madras, Calcutta and Karachi. The cost of the measures necessary to implement this commitment is of the order of 94 lakhs of rupees, or  705,000.India is still dependent on picric acid for fillings for high explosive shells for her field artillery. Picric acid is no longer used for this purpose in the United Kingdom, whence it can be obtained only with increasing difficulty, so much so that the supply is most precarious. The increasing likelihood of India&apos;s communications with the United Kingdom being interrupted in war makes it necessary that she should become, to the greatest possible extent, self-supporting in respect of her requirements in artillery ammunition and aircraft bombs. The early erection of factories for the manufacture in India of high explosive fillings for bombs and shells and of bomb cases respectively is considered essential. The cost of these measures is estimated at about 100 lakhs of rupees, or  750,000.11. Although the Appendix to this despatch comprises all those measures which can be foreseen at the present moment as required in order that a reasonable standard of efficiency may be attained, this list can not be look upon as having any degree of finality. It is a truism that no military programme of reorganisation and re-equipment can ever be final; the needs of the defence forces are always changing.As an instance of this, the question of the scale on which it is necessary to hold reserves of war material of all kinds is now being thoroughly and scientific-ally examined by a committee appointed especially for the purpose, and there is little doubt that this committee will recommend a considerable increase in the reserves now held of artillery ammunition and of armoured vehicles and other weapons. Again, the proposals for the re-equipment of the Royal Air Force in India do not include the provision of fighter aircraft or the ground equipment necessary to enable such aircraft to function efficiently. There is, moreover, no proposal at present to provide anti-aircraft artillery on a scale adequate to afford some degree of protection to vital points such as ports, advanced bases, railheads and arsenals, though there seems little doubt that it will not be long before the provision of such protection will become necessary.Although it has recently been decided to mechanize some of the British units of the Army in India, no attempt has yet been made to place the remaining British units or units of the Indian Army on a mechanized basis in respect of their first-line transport. If the Army in India is to assist in the defence of the Empire out-side India the provision of mechanized transport for some of its units may become necessary; the fact that the War Office, in the summer of last year, when specify-, ing the reinforcements required of India for the defence of Egypt, requested that all transport accompanying units should be mechanical bears out this expectation. As it was, the War Office requirement would have had to be met by improvisation which, in war, is likely to lead to confusion and the dislocation of existing plans, and arrangements. The provision of anti-tank weapons on a much greater scale than is at present contemplated is another instance of probable future requirements.12. Apart from the measures set out in this letter, we have to find 129 lakhs net for the capital cost of the reorganization of the British cavalry and infantry now in progress, the actual expense of the infantry reorganization having proved to be 30 lakhs more than the figure on which the contribution of 80 lakhs from His Majesty&apos;s Government was based.   Assuming that no further charges arise in* Map not received.
respect of new recruiting measures or from Home capitation payments, we have a reasonable expectation of being able to find 2^ crores for these purposes out. of savings on holding. A further 35 lakhs has become available from additional budget grants this year in replacement of amounts earmarked from the Defence Reserve Fund towards the cost of the Waziristan operations and the abandonment of the abattoir scheme.Nevertheless, taking some account of the uncosted measures referred to in paragraph 11 above, the programme visualised in this letter is likely to necessitate an outlay of something of the order of 4 crores of new capital money a year for the next five years, during which period our recurring charges would rise to an extra 2 crores a year.Furthermore, in taking a survey of our position it would be foolish for us to leave entirely out of account the possibility of heavy additional expenditure as the result of the further measures which are now under consideration for stimulating recruiting : if all of these measures were adopted and if their financial incidence were to be regulated in accordance with past practice, India would be faced with additional capital expenditure amounting ultimately to some 10 crores and with a recurring charge rising eventually to about 3 crores.13. It is true that only 8 or 9 years ago India was carrying a defence budget of 55 crores. But since that time the Centre has by devolution to the provinces and by the separation of Burma lost 10 crores of its annual resources, apart from 1\ crores of the petrol tax which it is making over annually to the provinces. Also during that period the policy of industrial protection has been further extended, notably in the matter of sugar, and losses of revenue from this policy can be made good only to a minor extent by the levy of excises on domestic production. Still further, we are confronted at the moment, as we shall explain more fully later, with insistent demands from the autonomous provinces for extra money at the expense of the Centre., 14, The Niemeyer formula operates as a heavy mortgage on the future resources of the Centre in that during the next 9 years we have progressively to assign to the provinces at least a further 5 crores of Income Tax receipts in addition to the If crores which we are relinquishing this year. The following-are the main assumptions on which Sir Otto apparently based his recommenda-tions regarding the amount of its Taxes on Income which the Centre, after meeting the loss on the separation of Burma, the heavy initial subsidies in one form or another to the provinces and its own increasing charges, could and should relinquish in favour of provinces by approximately the year 1948-49 : (ai) an increase above the 1936-37 figure of the revenue from existing taxation of the order of 10 crores;(b) a reduction of interest payments through conversions of about 2-^ croresbelow the 1936-37 figure;(c) defence expenditure not exceeding a certain level;(d) a release somewhere between 1941 and 1945 of a crore upon the comple-tion of the reconstruction of Quetta; and(e) certain reserves of taxation upon which the Centre could possibly fallback in case of failures in any of the above elements.15. Up to date, at any rate, the revenue side of our budget has not kept pace with this programme. We had to encroach upon our reserves of taxation for the year 1937-38, while the budget for 1938-39 is still about a crore short of a true balance. The linking up by Sir Otto of the fortunes of the provinces for the first five years with railway revenues, has deprived us of any relief in that direction, although in the light of the Wedgwood Report we are unlikely in any event to be enabled to look to railway revenues to provide us with additional resources. During the first five years practically all of any improvement of receipts under Taxes on Income accrues direct to the provinces and not to the Centre. In any event, elements (a), (b) to which we shall return in due course  and (d) must be regarded as pledged in the first instance to meet our liabilities under the Niemeyer award.16. It is not possible to state precisely what figures Sir Otto Niemeyer took into account for defence expenditure. But so far as can be inferred, after allowing for the separation of Burma and Aden, he visualised a defence budget expanding to 44^ crores (excluding Quetta) in 1943-44.   With this figure may be compared

Up to date, at any rate, the revenue side of our budget has not kept pace with this programme. We had to encroach upon our reserves of taxation for the year 1937-38, while the budget for 1938-39 is. still about a crore short of a true balance. The linking up by Sir Otto of the fortunes of the provinces for the first five years with railway revenues, has deprived.us of any relief in that direction, although in the light of the Wedgwood Report we are unlikely in any event to be enabled to look to railway revenues to provide us with additional resources.

It is not possible to state precisely what figures Sir Otto Niemeyer took , into account for defence expenditure. But so far as can be inferred, after allowing for the separation of Burma and Aden, he visualised a defence budget expanding to 44  crores (excluding Quetta) in 1943-44.  With this figure may be compared
the budget estimate of 44-40 crores for the year 1938-39. In short,,the normal cost of defence in India has already risen to a figure which Sir Otto assumed it would reach only in 5 years&apos; time. If to this position had to be added the expenditure involved by the measures referred to in this letter, it would be no exaggeration to say that the whole basis of the Niemeyer recommendations would be destroyed.17. The only substantial reserves of extra revenue open to us at the moment or in the near future are : (a) Salt, (at present at Rs. 1/9), an increase of which to Rs. 2/8 would produce 4^ crores;(b) Excise on cotton piece-goods. At 3^ per.cent. this might produce 2 crores;at 5 per cent, it might produce 3 crores;(c) A further surcharge on Taxes on Income.18. The proceeds of a Federal surcharge would of course accrue to the Centre. But, there would be obvious difficulties at the moment in satisfying the requirements of sub-section (2) of section 141 of the Government of India Act, while presumably under article X of the Instrument of Instructions to the Governor-General the views of the ministerial governments of the provinces on such a proposal would have to be sought.The provinces would naturally argue that any extra resources to be obtained in any manner through the head &quot;Taxes on Income &quot; should fall into the distributable class, in which case practically the whole of the proceeds would for the present go to the provinces and so would not be available for Central purposes. (Incidentally the commercial community still considers us guilty of something like a breach of faith in not having completed the removal of the emergency surcharge on Taxes on Income imposed in 1931.)19. Even though there may appear to be rather more support at the present time for an adequate defence organization in India than there has been for many years, it is unfortunately the case that this support would definitely not be forthcoming if defence expenditure were to rise. In the main it takes the form of a demand for the increasing association of Indians in the defence of their own country, coupled with greater provision of modern armaments, the money for which should be obtained by the total elimination of the British portion of the Army in India. To raise, in these circumstances, the Salt Duty or to re-impose the excise on cotton piece-goods (with its unfortunate history) for the object of increasing defence expenditure would raise a political storm, the outcome of which it would be impossible to predict. Even though we were to argue that the increase in military expenditure was inevitable and that the imposition of these taxation measures was only to preserve the Niemeyer settlement, the effect on Indian vocal opinion would be no different.20. We have had recently at an informal conference of Finance Ministers an opportunity of gauging fairly accurately the attitude which would be assumed by the provincial Ministries to some of these matters. Most of the provinces are demanding more money either in the form of cash subventions or through a process of open or veiled encroachments into the central field of taxation. We have given them clear warning that we shall be bound to resist any substantial invasion of the central field, while we have also had to inform them that there is no prospect until the Niemeyer assignments of Income Tax are complete of their obtaining any further resources through the operation of section 140 of the Government of India Act.h 21. But the essential tasks of social reconstruction certainly lie in the provincial sphere and the Ministries&apos; policies of extending &quot;nation building&quot; services and of giving relief to the rural, classes have the country behind them. It is certain that if the Centre is discovered to have been able in any manner to furnish the Defence Department with substantial extra funds for the equipment and upkeep of what all Indians regard as a non-national defence force while we had declined to.take similar steps to help to provide for the urgent social needs of the people of India, a very serious political situation would be created vis-a-vis the provinces, which might easily lead to a breakdown in, at any rate, the Congress provinces. - ,,
22. It may, however, be asked why the expenditure should not be financed by &apos;&apos; raiding &quot; the sinking fund as far as it will go and borrowing the remainder of our requirements. Most of what has been said in the latter portion of the immediately preceding paragraph applies as pertinently to a recourse to raiding the sinking fund as to the imposition of new taxation measures. The annual 3 crores provided at present for the purpose have been publicly acknowledged to be far below the necessities of our debt situation and in any case the provinces would argue with some vehemence that if the sinking fund is to be raided it should be for constructive and not for destructive measures.23. On a review of the amount which it would be necessary to borrow over and above the 3 crores available from impounding, the sinking fund, we estimate that at the end of the five-year period we should be left with the sinking fund permanently mortgaged.24. All this is independent of (i) any deterioration of&apos;our credit as a result of a policy involving not only the abolition of the sinking fund, but borrowing for non-productive purposes in addition, and (ii) the possibility of further heavy charges (both recurring and non-recurring) as a result of new measures to stimulate recruiting. As regards (i) it is only necessary to set out our maturing obligations in the next few years, viz. : C roves.1938-39 1939-40 1940-41 1941-42 1942-431H 27f 25i lOfmwith another 74J crores in the following three years. In these circumstances, can it be denied that element (&amp;) (paragraph 14 above) of the assumptions on which Sir Otto Niemeyer&apos;s proposals were based, would be substantially changed? Further taxation measures in order to carry out the Niemeyer programme would be inevitable, even if nothing further happened under (ii).25. Apart from the natural objections to borrowing for this purpose based on canons of public finance, we would, moreover, strongly deprecate the deplorable example which such a course would set at the present time to provinces who regard themselves as committed to policies of reducing excise and land revenue and who are tempted to indulge in spectacular expenditure measures. There is reason to believe that some of the Congress Ministries have already turned their eyes to borrowing as a means of disguising unsound measures of public finance. But this would not prevent them from attacking the Government of India if we resorted to borrowing for defence purposes.26. In whatever manner then we might attempt to finance these measures ourselves, we should in about the year 1942-43 be confronted with perhaps the major part of the Niemeyer programme still to implement and in all probability with : (a) our revenues expanding at a slower rate than was anticipated bySir Otto;.(b) the improvement expected by him by way of fall of interest rates only partially if at all realised;(c) defence expenditure (and debt charges) permanently higher than he assumed;(d) the sinking fund contribution dissipated; and(e) the reserves of taxation partially, at any rate, used up.There would clearly be great difficulty in completing the Niemeyer devolutions, and, if special recruiting measures prove to be necessary, a virtual impossibility of doing so. This threat to the programme could not fail to be quickly discovered by the provinces and public in India, while any hope of the provinces receiving a reasonable period anything over and above the Niemeyer amounts would have to be abandoned. The probable effects on provincial politics have already been set out.
27 There is also to be taken into account the effect on the Indian States in their attitude towards Federation. Some of them have already shown a tendency to be mistrustful of joining their fortunes with those of the Government of India on the plea that the financial position of the Centre is not so strong as they were led to expect during the course of the Round Table Conference, and in particular they have put their finger on the reduction of the sinking fund contribution from its former level as a special sign of deterioration.28. From a financial point of view it is almost certain that it would be impossible for India to shoulder the expenditure contemplated in this letter, even if no extra recruiting measures are undertaken and even if the secondary (in time but not necessarily in magnitude), effects of borrowing are ignored. When political considerations are also taken into account there is no doubt that it would be impossible.29. In the foregoing paragraphs of this letter an attempt has been made to set out fairly the dilemma with which the Government of India are confronted. On the one hand, they are satisfied that the measures, which are now put forward, are necessary if India is to be in a position adequately to defend herself, and at the same, time to fulfil the obligation which she has undertaken to send reinforce-ments overseas in the event of an emergency, in which the reinforcing formations may be opposed by troops of a first-class military power.On the other hand, they are equally satisfied that India is unable to pay for these measures or to bear the rising cost of defence which lies ahead. Unless the necessary money is forthcoming, India will have no alternative but to do the best she can with the 44^ crores a year, which is all that she is likely to be able to make available for defence purposes. The Government of India would, however, be failing in their duty if they did not call His Majesty&apos;s Governments attention to the position and to its resultant risks.30. The Government of India would strongly urge upon His Majesty&apos;s Government that the present condition of the world and the recent developments in the constitutional position of India have produced a situation which calls for a redetermination of India&apos;s defence problem in both its military and financial aspects, and for the conclusion to a new &quot; contract &quot; between the United Kingdom and India, in which India&apos;s financial limitations are recognised.,&quot; ,7.. *     *     * &quot; ,.

REPORT.Part I. The Defence Problems of India.The Defence Problems of India. 1.   India &apos;s security involves-(a) Secure communications with the rest of the Empire.(b) Her defence against external aggression, of which the major commitmentis on the North-West Frontier, and which also includes the defence of Indian ports against seaborne attacks.(c) The control of the tribes on her land frontiers.(d) The preservation of internal security.With regard to 1 (a) above, the defence forces of India have not hitherto been specifically organized to participate in the defence of Imperial communica-tions outside India, though many instances have v occurred where India has rendered such assistance.The changed aspect of the general strategic situation and its implications with regard to this question are discussed in paragraphs 9 to 15 below.The present Composition and Organization of the Army and Air Force in India. 2.   At present the Army in India is divided into (a) The Field Army.(b) Covering Troops.(c) Internal Security Troops.  .(d) Coast Defence Units.Appendix A gives the allotment of the Army in India to these duties. The Royal Air Force in India consists of 4 Army Co-operation Squadrons.4 Bomber Squadrons.J Bomber Transport Flight.1 Indian Air Force Squadron.    (Army co-operation, in process of formation.)Appendix B gives the constitutional position of the defence forces in India.3. The role of the Field Army is primarily, in conjunction with the Royal Air Force; to defend the North-West Frontier against aggression first by Afghanistan, and secondly by Russia (with Afghanistan either friendly or hostile) until the arrival of reinforcements from home.For this purpose the Field Army is organised as 3 Cavalry Brigades. 3^ Divisions. Certain Army Troops.4. The role of the Covering Troops in conjunction with the air forces on the frontier is at all times to assist the civil authorities in their control of both administered and unadministered areas; these troops are also responsible for protecting the lines of communication of the Field Army in the event of active operations beyond the frontier.For this duty the troops allotted are the peace garrisons of the Peshawar, Kohat, Waziristan and Western (Independent) Districts, which amount to a force of four cavalry regiments and fifty-three infantry battalions.5. The role of the Internal Security Troops includes not only assistance to the civil power in the maintenance of law and order within India, but also the preservation of the security of internal strategical communications, and the protection of lives and-property in times of serious internal disorder.Forces allotted to these duties amount to five cavalry regiments and forty-six infantry battalions (after certain current schemes of reorganisation have been completed).6. The defence of Indian ports against seaborne attack requires not only Coast Defence Units (Artillery and Searchlights)&quot;, but in addition, four British
and three Indian infantry battalions which have the dual role of coast defence and internal security, and which are included in the total of forty-six given in the previous paragraph.The scale of attack hitherto anticipated against Indian ports is given in C.I.D. Paper No. 417-C, dated March 1936.7. The role of the Royal Air Force in India is to play its part in conjunction with the army in the fulfilment of the&apos;functions described in paragraphs 3 to 6 above.Prior to 1927 its strength.was six squadrons. In 1927 two squadrons were added, mainly as the result of the formation of an Afghan Air Force. In addition the first Indian Air Force Squadron is now partially formed.With the exception of one British squadron, the Bomber Transport Flight and the Indian Air Force Squadron, all the air force in India is normally located in the frontier districts, where it is employed in normal times in the day-to-day duties of watch and ward on the frontier, and is available at short notice for operations against external aggression.Although air forces are not normally employed in the maintenance of internal security in India itself, they would certainly be required to play their part in the suppression of major outbreaks which assumed the proportions of rebellion.At present the aircraft and equipment of the squadrons in India are all of an obsolete type, only suited to the limited role of tribal operations within India&apos;s borders.8. Though certain measures of reorganisation are now taking place, the general strength of the forces in India is still largely based on the strategical situation as it existed fifteen years ago after the post-war reorganisation.Part II. The Requirements of Strategic Reserves.The Strategical Situation.9. Fifteen years ago the situation vis-a-vis Russia was uncertain, Afghanistan was a restless and unstable neighbour, internal conditions in India were just recovering from a period of grave disturbance.Elsewhere the British Empire had apparently nothing to fear. The power of Germany was broken, there was no other Power whose military strength caused us any serious anxiety, there was no clear threat to Imperial communica-tions, and the hope still existed that the League of Nations would ensure peace, based on collective security.10. To-day the situation has changed. Collective security has failed. The Empire is threatened by Germany and Japan, and the rise of the Italian Empire must always constitute a potential threat to our communications in the Middle East. Calls on British Forces are steadily increasing, and are becoming more difficult to meet.The air re-armament of Germany has imposed an immense burden in the shape of vastly increased air forces and anti-air defences for the defence of Great Britain. The British Forces, both land and air, in the Middle and Far East have had to be notably increased. For example, there are at the present time nine short-tour battalions serving overseas. This has reacted unfavourably on the recruiting situation, and in consequence many battalions overseas, in Palestine for instance, are numerically too weak for the proper performance of their important tasks.11. The rise of potentially hostile naval and air power in Europe has decreased the measure of security to India which the British fleet could afford. Hence, the defence of the vital areas on the communications in the Middle East and at Singapore is of more direct concern to India than has been the case hitherto, and the defence of Indian ports against seaborne attack has assumed increased importance.12. In India, the immediate threat to the North-West Frontier from Russian and Afghan aggression has diminished, but the danger may prove to be only latent and may reassume serious proportions as the result of adverse factors either in Russia or Afghanistan, or in connection with the world situation.
In this connection it must be recognised that Russia can now undertake a heavy scale of direct air action against the cities of Northern India from bases in Russian Territory.In ill-organized countries like Afghanistan, moreover, foreign intervention in the modern sense (such as is now taking place in Spain and China) may assume serious proportions.13. The history of the North-West Frontier during the last five years shows that the tribal problems are still urgent and continuous.The increase in the supply of modern rifles among the tribes, which has been a marked feature since the end of the Great War, still continues.A further disturbing factor is the extent to which the tribes are prepared to co-operate with subversive elements within India itself.14. India herself is undertaking a great constitutional experiment, and it is likely that calls on troops for the preservation of law and order may increase. It is even possible that the internal situation may at the worst deteriorate into a, state of open rebellion.The extremists of the Congress Party have openly stated that they will take advantage of any war in which India is directly or indirectly involved to further by revolutionary methods their aim of driving the British out of India. They are also attempting to create disaffection in the Indian Army, in which the progress of Indianisation may well decrease the decree of reliance which can be placed on the loyalty of certain units.15. Thus it will be seen that, while the problems of internal security and of tribal control have not undergone any considerable modification, India&apos;s liability to attack from across her frontiers has diminished in urgency and altered in quality.The dangers to the British Empire as a whole, however, with which India&apos;s security is inextricably connected, have materially increased.The Need for Strategic Reserves in the East.16. In the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee&apos;s* &quot; Mediterranean, Middle-East and North-East Africa Appreciation,&quot; the fact has been recognised that the Mediterranean may well be closed to British shipping in war and that reliance can no longer be placed on obtaining immediate reinforcements for the Middle and Far East from the United Kingdom in time. For instance, the journey to Egypt via the Cape would take thirty to sixty days, according to the type of ship employed, and this constitutes a delay which would prove extremely dangerous.In order, therefore, to ensure a reasonable degree of security of Imperial, and therefore Indian, interests, the need is apparent for reserves situated to the East of the Mediterranean Basin.17. The areas in which danger is to be anticipated are the Middle East (including the Eastern Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf) and the Far East (including Burma). Considerations affecting the reinforcement of these areas have been discussed in C.I.D. Papers Nos. C.O.S. 691 and CCS. 596. Some of the recommendations in these papers have been or are being-implemented by an increase of the peace garrisons in these areas, but a British battalion required for Malta can in existing circumstances only be found by adding to the number of short-tour battalions abroad. The further immediate reinforcements required in war are discussed below.The Eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea.18. In the event of a war in the Mediterranean, immediate land reinforce-ments are required for Egypt and Aden. Local unrest might make it necessary to reinforce the R.A.F. Station at Dhibban in Iraq, to protect the Anglo-Iranian oilfields, and to secure the Jiead of the Persian Gulf. There are also possible commitments in a lower order of priority in the Sudan, British Somaliland and Kenya.* This Appreciation (CCS. 691) was approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 25th March, 1938.
19. Although our air forces in the Middle East have recently been increased, we should still be in a position of dangerous inferiority in the air vis-a-vis Italy in the event of a war in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea area. Even if reinforcements from the United Kingdom are available at all in these circumstances, which they could not be if we were at the same time at war with Germany, they cannot arrive in Egypt for about&apos; two months owing to the necessity of going round the Cape.It is, therefore, of vital importance that the air forces normally located in Egypt, North-East Africa and Aden should be reinforced at the shortest possible notice by as many squadrons as can be made available from other Commands in the East, which can reach Egypt by air.20. The forces immediately required for this area, as assessed by the Chiefs of Staff, are :- .(a) Land Forces.(i) For Egypt;   2 Infantry Brigades with a quota of DivisionalTroops, and Army Troops, (ii) For Aden :  1 Infantry Battalion:(iii) For the Anglo-Iranian Oilfields:   1  Infantry Brigade and attached troops.^b) Air Forces.For the Middle East Command (including Aden) existing plans envisage a reinforcement of nine squadrons, five from Iraq and four from India, though it is recognised that the availability of the latter is dependent on the situation in India at the time of the emergency.The Far East (including Burma).21. The situation vis-a-vis Japan in the Far East requires that, in the event of war between the British Empire and any first-class Power, immediate reinforcements are sent to Singapore to secure the fortress.In the light of recent developments in the situation in the Far East, Burma might be exposed to external attack. The risk of rebellion in Burma must also be considered and an immediate increase in the strength of her forces might be necessary in either contingency.22.   The immediate reinforcements required would amount to : (a) Land Forces.(i) For Singapore : 1 Infantry Brigade and attached troops, (ii) For Hong Kong: in certain circumstances, 2 Infantry Battalions, (iii) For Burma : 1 Infantry Brigade and attached troops.(b) Air Forces.(i) For Singapore : in the event of the Empire being involved in any first-class war, at least two squadrons for which at present India has accepted a qualified commitment. In a war with Japan the air reinforcements required from India and other Commands amount to a total of four squadrons, (ii) For Burma : it is impossible to state with any precision the air reinforcements that might be required for Burma; but as a general indication this reinforcement might amount to at least two squadrons, and possibly more in the event of Siamese territory being used by an enemy as a base for air attack on objectives in Burma.Location of Reserves.23. India, situated almost half-way between Egypt and Singapore, on the direct route between them, is, except for one eventuality, the most suitable area East of the Mediterranean in which to station reserves for the Middle and Far East, and is in general less vulnerable than other possible areas. The exception Jioted is the immediate reinforcement of Egypt, which presents a difficult problem.
From India a convoy would take approximately fourteen days to reach Suez by sea and the use of the overland route from Basra would not shorten this period. In view of the position of Egypt vis-a-vis Libya, even this delay might be very serious. For speed of action and general availability, Palestine is in most respects the most suitable station for the immediate strategic reserves for Egypt, but the strength of the force which could be maintained there in peace time is probably limited to one infantry brigade, leaving one infantry brigade and divisional troops to be provided from elsewhere.Air reinforcements not being subject to the same limitations of transporta-tion as land forces, the factors outlined above apply in a lesser degree to the selection of locations for air reserves, so long as they are situated somewhere East of the Mediterranean Basin, are complete with the necessary reserves, and have secure and properly organized air routes along which to move.A primary role of the air force maintained in Iraq in peace is to act as a strategic reserve to reinforce either eastwards or westwards in an emergency. There would, however, be grave practical difficulties in increasing our air strength in Iraq or Egypt; and India has many advantages as a central and relatively secure site for the location of additional air reserves for the Middle and Far East.24. To sum up. While India is the most suitable location for the bulk of the land and air reserves required, one infantry brigade must be located as close to Egypt as possible, and Palestine has been accepted by the Committee of Imperial Defence for this purpose.The Sources from which Reserves could be made A vailable.The United Kingdom.25. There are a number of factors, the first of which is the strategical situa-tion, which would almost certainly preclude the raising and maintenance of additional forces at home to meet these commitments, and even if they could be raised they could not, if located in the United Kingdom, arrive in time.The Dominions.26. The provision of reserves from the Dominions raises a wide question which is outside our terms of reference, but it should be remembered that the forces of the Dominions are maintained primarily for the defence of their own territories and in the main on a Territorial basis. This means that no immediate reinforcements can be made available at the outset of a campaign. For instance, under present arrangements, the first troops available for dispatch overseas from any Dominion are two infantry brigades (organized for garrison duties only) from Australia thirty-seven days after mobilization.Iraq.27. As shown in paragraph 20 above, the whole of the Royal Air Force garrison in Iraq (five squadrons) is already earmarked for reinforcing purposes in existing plans, and at least one of these squadrons has to be replaced from other sources in order to avoid denuding Iraq of all air forces in war. These five squadrons are, however, inadequate to meet all the potential commitments given in paragraphs 20 and 22 above.India.28. As has been shown in paragraphs 9 to 15 above, there are grounds for the belief that on the present scale of her defence forces India is less under-insured than are other parts of the British Empire. Moreover, the degree of readiness of the forces in India is in some respects, higher than elsewhere, and she maintains a large standing army in peace.Conclusion.29. It appears, therefore, that India is the only available source from which to find the necessary immediate reinforcements for the Middle and Far East in emergency.
Part III. The Capacity of India to Provide Reserves.The Capacity of India to Provide Reserves.30. Under present conditions India has accepted the following contingent liabilities : (a) Land Forces For Egypt and Aden : 1 Infantry Brigade and attached troops; For the Anglo-Iranian Oilfields :   1 Infantry Brigade and attached troops;For Burma : 1 Infantry Brigade;For Singapore : 1 Infantry Brigade and attached troops; For Hong Kong : 2 Infantry Battalions;but the provision of these forces is made contingent on the situation in India at the time permitting their despatch, and on the overall limit of 3 Infantry Brigades and attached troops.(Note. -These Infantry Brigades are at present all organized on a basis of four battalions.)(b) Air Forces 4 Squadrons for the Middle East. 2 Squadrons for Singapore.The despatch of these squadrons is again dependent on the situation in India and is subject to an overall limit of 4 squadrons at any one time.31.   These arrangements suffer from the following disadvantages : (a) It is difficult to make firm plans for the defence of the various areas concerned, since there is no certainty that the reinforcements from India would actually be made available when required, and there are no alternative sources from which these immediate reinforcements could be drawn.(b) The present arrangement is repugnant to Indian political opinion andsubject to embarrassing criticism on the grounds that India is main-taining at her own expense forces to meet commitments in which it is claimed in some Indian political circles that she herself has no direct interest.(c) India is not at present maintaining forces organized and equipped in a manner suited to the tasks which they may have to perform.32. With a view not only to removing the above disadvantages, but also in order to meet the requirements of His Majesty&apos;s Government arising out of the existing world situation, the Defence Department of the Government of India has examined the existing forces maintained in India in relation to the essential needs of that country. For this purpose the possibility of effecting reductions under the folloAving heads has been closely scrutinised in the light of prevailing-conditions : Covering Troops. Internal Security Troops. Field Army.The conclusions reached are set out in Appendices D, E and F, and are discussed below.Land Forces.(i) Covering Troops.33. In Appendix &quot; D,&quot; entitled &quot; The Possibility of Reducing the Strength of the Covering Troops in India,&quot; the General Staff in India set out clearly their view that, owing to the improved armament of the tribesmen and to the more effective tactics they are adopting in the conduct of tribal warfare, the problem of controlling tribal areas is becoming no less difficult as time passes.    It is[17443] &apos;        f
pointed out that, during the recent disturbances in Mohmand Country 1935, and in Waziristan 1936-37, it proved necessary to reinforce the normal garrisons of the frontier districts with strong contingents from the Field Army.The general conclusions reached are, first, that there is no justification for any reduction in the strength of the Covering Troops, and, second, that in conditions which would obtain if the strength of the Field Army were reduced, the task of the Covering Troops in the event of unsettled relations with Afghanistan would be just as important and far more exacting.The question of whether the problem of controlling the tribal areas is becoming more difficult as time passes is one on which we recognise that there are divergent opinions. Nevertheless, we do not recommend that the strength of the Covering Troops should be reduced, especially in view of the possible modifications of strategic policy in the event of war with Afghanistan, referred to in sub-paragraph (iii) below.(ii) Internal Security Troops.When it was proposed to convert four British battalions on the Indian establishment into machine-gun battalions, the Government of India accepted the withdrawal of four British battalions from internal security duties and their transfer to the Field Army. The proposal to form British machine-gun battalions in India has now been abandoned, and the Government of India are prepared, we understand, to surrender from the Indian establishment the four British battalions previously selected for conversion and transfer to the Field Army, subject to certain conditions, as set out in paragraph 42 regarding the modernization of the Army in India.The question of the further reduction of British battalions allotted to internal security duties has been the subject of a recent and exhaustive review by the General Staff in India. We attach, as Appendix &quot; E,&quot; their memorandum entitled &quot; The British Element in Internal Security Troops,&quot; which includes an -examination of the question of substituting a gendarmerie force for British regular battalions allotted for internal security duties.We invite attention to the wording of the last paragraph of this memorandum, which reads :  &quot; The safety of the European and Anglo-Indian lives and interests in India is ultimately dependent on the British element in the Internal Security Troops. Under existing proposals* this element will be reduced by 30 per cent, at a time when the internal situation in India contains more potential dangers than it has since 1857.&quot; In offering this reduction, the Government of India is taking a risk which could only be justified having regard to the urgent needs of the Empire in the existing world situation. It must be realized that, in the event of serious internal disorder, Field Army reserves may have to be called upon to reinforce Internal Security Troops.&quot;We have not had, as a Committee, the opportunity to examine the whole intricate problem of internal security in India in all its details, but, subject to further examination of the question, if that be considered necessary, we feel that the views of the Defence Authorities in India, with whom the responsibility rests, should be accepted. We note the cogent arguments which are advanced against the formation in India of a gendarmerie &quot;force. We understand, moreover, that this proposal has been severely criticised on political grounds by the responsible civil authority in India.(iii) Field Army.The Government of India are, we understand, prepared in Imperial interests to place at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government from the existing Field Army in India the equivalent of one division, comprising three infantry brigades each of three battalions, and the full complement of divisional troops, with one additional infantry battalion.t They point out, however, that the release of this division should be contingent upon effect being given to certain measures of* These include, inter- alia, the withdrawal of four British battalions. I The proposed composition of this Division is given in Appendix C.
reorganisation and re-equipment of the Army in India. The implications of reducing the Field Army in India to this extent are explained in the memorandum by the General Staff, India, entitled : &quot; The Defence of India in a Contingency when an Imperial Reserve Division, drawn from the normal resources of the Army in India, is not available for operations.&quot; This memorandum is reproduced as Appendix F.The present friendly attitude of the Afghan Government may prove to be only temporary and we must assume that this attitude may in time of an Imperial emergency change under pressure and persuasion by hostile Powers. The contingency of a hostile Afghanistan combined with widespread disaffection among the frontier tribes cannot, therefore, be discounted, and India&apos;s prepara-tions to meet that contingency must be adequate and complete. Existing plans for the contingency of war with Afghanistan envisage a land offensive into Afghanistan with the object of bringing that country to terms, and involve the employment of the Field Army, comprising three cavalry brigades and three and one-third divisions, and the air forces in India.We observe that the proposed reorganisation and re-equipment of the defence forces in India will increase their capacity to implement this plan, which can, however, only be adopted if the Imperial Reserve Division is made available by His Majesty&apos;s Government for this purpose.On the assumption that the Field Army is to be reduced as now proposed by one division, allocated to the Imperial reserve, the General Staff, India, have prepared in outline an alternative plan for the conduct of war against Afghanistan combined with tribal disturbances on a serious scale. They reach the conclusion that, in these conditions, any considerable offensive by land forces into Afghan territory, which is the essence of the existing accepted war plan, would be impracticable. Our land forces would be compelled to adopt a more defensive attitude, undertaking only local offensives with limited objectives into enemy territory. The adoption of such a policy, though sufficient to secure the administered districts of India against hostile invasion, would not bring the Afghan Government to terms acceptable to ourselves. It would, therefore, be necessary to compensate for the comparatively defensive attitude of our land forces by undertaking a vigorous and sustained air offensive from the outbreak of war.We understand that the Government of India&apos;s agreement to place this division at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government is made without any qualifications, but if in the circumstances of the time His Majesty&apos;s Government were to make this division available for use&apos;by India, it would allow the more effective plan for war against Afghanistan to be put into operation.There must be some doubt, however, in woidd conditions such as the present whether His Majesty&apos;s Government could permit its main Imperial Reserve to become involved in a war in Afghanistan, if that precluded the possibility of its withdrawal for Imperial purposes in the event of a sudden deterioration of the situation in the Middle or Far East.In general, we agree with the view that, in an Imperial emergency, it would be in the best interests of the Empire to employ one Indian division on the protec-tion of Imperial communications outside India, and to accept the disadvantages of the adoption by our land forces of a generally defensive policy on the North-West Frontier of India if simultaneous trouble broke out in that quarter. We would point out, however, that this policy is likely to involve considerable additional demands on the air forces in India.(iv) Possibility of releasing Artillery Units.The present accepted strength of Field Artillery in India is eleven Brigades (each of sixteen guns), of which one is Indianising and cannot be regarded as fully efficient for some time to come.The War Office would like India to release two Field Brigades, R.A., in addition to the artillery required for an Imperial Reserve Division, since the re-organization of the artillery at home has notably reduced the amount of artillery available for the Field Force.The Defence Authorities in India, however, maintain that, although no Field Artillery need be specifically allocated to internal security duties, the total Field Artillery required in India at the unrestricted disposal of the Commander-in-Chief is eight Field Brigades.   Assuming three Field Brigades for the Imperial
Reserve Division, this minimum of eight (including one only partially efficient) is all that remains.   These are allotted as follows : Field Army Brigades.1st Division 3rd Divisiono 2 3 1G.H.Q. Reserve Covering TroopsTotal8The surrender of two further Field Brigades would therefore reduce the number in India below the minimum considered necessary by the Defence Authorities.Air Forces.34. We are informed that the Defence Authorities in India are satisfied that a force of two Bomber Squadrons, three A.C. Squadrons and one Bomber Transport Squadron (two flights) equipped with aircraft of adequate performance will be a sufficient air component in the forces required to deal with tribal unrest on any scale within India&apos;s own borders.We must observe that on several occasions within recent years, such as the Waziristan operations of 1936-37 and the Afridi operations of 1930-31, a considerably larger force was required; on the former occasion six squadrons of the Air Force in India were engaged in dealing with an outbreak in one area of the frontier alone, and it was also necessary to call on the assistance of Bomber Transport aircraft from Iraq.We understand, however, that the Defence Authorities in India base their present view of the air requirements for tribal control on two assumptions : (a) That the squadrons concerned will be equipped with aircraft of greatlysuperior performance and striking power than those available in the past.(b) That full use is made of the available air forces on the lines laid downin the new Combined Frontier Manual.We interpret the latter assumption as indicating that, subject to the safe-guards which are laid down in the new manual, the authorities in India, both political and military, will employ the air forces to the fullest extent possible in dealing promptly with incipient outbreaks. We consider it advisable to draw attention to this point as we note that in the past the capacity of air forces to deal promptly with incipient outbreaks, and thus reduce the chance of their assuming serious proportions, has not always been fully utilised.The safeguards referred to above are those which have been laid down to secure against the ruthless or inhumane use of air forces, which safeguards have in fact governed their employment on the frontier for many years.On the assumptions stated above, we are prepared.to endorse the view that a force of up-to-date aircraft of the strength proposed should, save in quite exceptional circumstances, be an adequate air component in tribal operations, although such a force is unlikely to be able to afford close support to columns on the scale which has recently been possible.(ii) Afghan War-.We are informed that in the view of the Defence Authorities in India, a war with Afghanistan would, require that four Bomber Squadrons of the highest performance should be available in addition to the force described in sub-paragraph (i) above, making a total force of six Bomber, three A.C., and one Bomber Transport Squadron (two flights) a small increase in first-line strength over the existing air force in India. We understand that this view as to the strength required is again based on the two assumptions referred to in sub-paragraph (i) above, and also on the assumption that Afghanistan would not be provided with any material increase to her existing air force, covert or otherwise, from extraneous sources.(i) Tribal Operations.
Since the present strength of the air forces in India was determined there have been two developments of great importance, namely, the formation of about three squadrons of relatively up-to-date aircraft in the Afghan Air Force (including types of considerably superior performance to any now existing in the Royal Air Force in India) and the possibility of foreign intervention on modern lines.A further possibility which must materially affect the air problem in a war with Afghanistan, is the modified plan for the conduct of such a war consequent upon the withdrawal of one division to Imperial reserve, outlined in the Note by the General Staff, India, attached as Appendix F. We endorse the view stated in paragraph 3 of that Appendix that &quot;active Afghan hostility would, without any doubt whatever, be followed by widespread disaffection among our frontier tribes&apos;&apos; the more so in view of the more defensive attitude which our land forces will be compelled to adopt; and we note from paragraph 11 of the Appendix that there are at least six points, from the Zhob to Mohmand country, where Afghan incursion across the frontier might occur.In these circumstances we endorse the view expressed by the General Staff, India, in paragraph 13 of Appendix F. that &quot; it will be necessary to compensate for the more defensive attitude of our land forces by a vigorous and sustained air offensive from the outset of a war &quot; even if the air forces at the disposal of Afghanistan were no more than the present strength of the Afghan Air Force itself. We agree that in these circumstances the force proposed by the Defence Authorities in India would probably be adequate for an Afghan war, hut only on two basic assumptions (a) that the restrictions now imposed on the application of air power areremoved indeed, we believe that, it would often be necessary to relax some of the safeguards, such as warning notices, at present laid down for tribal operations in the Combined Manual; and(b) that the land forces engaged in tribal control within our own borderswould have to conduct any necessary tribal operations often with less &apos; close air support than has recently been the custom.We are, however, impressed with the serious potentialities of foreign air intervention in the modern sense. It seems clear that this possibility will not necessarily be confined to circumstances in which the Soviet Government is in a state of open hostility to the Empire. We consider that if foreign intervention assumed serious proportions, the situation would be beyond the capacity of the new proposed air force in India to deal with unassisted. We understand that the Defence Authorities in India concur with this view.(iii) Russian Air Intervention.If Russian air intervention on a large scale were to occur, a new and dangerous situation would arise. This is a contingency which we have not taken into account in estimating India&apos;s air needs, but it would involve a very serious Imperial commitment.(iv) Internal Security.It is possible that conditions amounting to open rebellion, in which air forces might be required in connection with internal security, might coincide with a war with Afghanistan. We do not suggest that any air forces should be maintained in India specifically for this role, but if these conditions arose it would be more difficult to spare any squadrons for operations outside India.(v) Coast Defence.We consider that even in circumstances in which Indian ports will be liable to sea-borne attack, the reinforcement of Singapore and the Middle East should have priority over requirements of coast defence in India.We do not, therefore, suggest that India should maintain any regular air forces specifically for Indian coast defence, though the two squadrons for which coast defence is at present an accepted alternative role should continue to be trained and equipped for the purpose. But we urge that the policy, already recommended, of raising auxiliary air units for spotting and reconnaissance duties from the local flying clubs at the main defended ports should be put in hand at once.
35. It will be seen, therefore, that modern conditions may necessitate the employment of an air force amounting to six Bomber Squadrons, three A.C. Squadrons and one Bomber Transport Squadron, for the requirements of Indians own local defence (excluding attack by Russia).The emergencies for which these forces are calculated are war against Afghanistan (without material covert assistance) combined with wide-spread tribal unrest. If Afghanistan remains friendly, up to four Bomber Squadrons can readily be made available for employment overseas. If, however, the two contingencies arise simultaneously, these four squadrons will be required for the successful prosecution of the war against Afghanistan.The result is that no surplus can be relied upon as available to meet the commitments of Imperial defence outside India; and therefore that Indians capacity to meet these commitments must remain, as at present, a contingent liability with all its disadvantages, unless the air forces in India can be not only modernised, but also increased in strength.36. It may be convenient here to summarise the. position regarding the provision of reserves. We consider that the following are the measures which the Government of India, on the basis of their present proposals, could well implement: (a) The surrender of four British infantry battalions from the peace garrison of India.(b) The unconditional allocation of one Indian division (organized as inAppendix C) to His Majesty&apos;s Government as a strategic reserve for use wherever and whenever required.(c) The acceptance of a contingent liability to provide up to four bomber squadrons, R.A.F., in emergency, dependent on the situation in India at the time.37. From paragraphs 16 to 22 it will be seen that, while the total of potential commitments in the Middle and Far East cannot be accurately foretold, the immediate requirements in land forces are at present: (a) For war in the Mediterranean.To Egypt: 2 Infantry Brigades and a quota of Divisional Troops.Of these, 1 Infantry Brigade (of 3 Battalions) will be stationed in Palestine in peace. To Aden : 1 Infantry Battalion.To Anglo-Iranian Oilfields : 1 Infantry Brigade and attached Troops.(b) For war in the Far East.To Burma : 1 Infantry Brigade and attached Troops. To Hong Kong : 2 Infantry Battalions (the provision of these units is now being reconsidered).(c) For war with any First-Class Power.To Singapore : 1 Infantry Brigade and attached Troops.(d) In peace and war.To Malta :  1 Infantry Battalion in place of an existing short-term battalion.38.   Whereas therefore the immediate requirements in land forces total 5 Infantry Brigades, 4 Infantry Battalions,the land forces that can be made available from India total Summary regarding the Provision of Reserves.Indian Division).4 British Battalions.
39. Assuming that the four British battalions are employed to provide the infantry brigade for Palestine and the infantry battalion for Malta (in both of which areas British troops are specifically required), there remains a deficit of 1 Infantry Brigade. 2 Infantry Battalions.Consequently all the immediate reinforcements required cannot be supplied simultaneously and certain commitments which are of less vital importance must be placed lower in the order of priority. Under existing world conditions we consider that Burma and Hong Kong should be placed in the latter category.40. From paragraphs 19 to 22 it will be seen that the total air reinforce-ments envisaged in existing plans are (a) For the Middle East, including Aden (but excluding the one squadronrequired to remain in Iraq :8 squadrons.(b) For the Far East, excluding Burma :4 squadrons.Of these requirements it will be seen from paragraph 27 that Iraq can provide an unconditional quota of four squadrons, while India can at present only accept a conditional liability to provide up to a maximum of four squadrons.41. In effect, eight squadrons only may be available to meet a requirement of twelve, and of these eight the four Indian squadrons are only conditionally available. Two squadrons are required in all circumstances at Singapore. Both the Middle and Far Eastern commitments are of equal importance, and to some extent at least are certain to arise simultaneously, so that there remains a deficiency of four squadrons, or, if India cannot implement her conditional commitment, eight squadrons, for which no provision can at present be found.It will be noted that the above calculation takes no account of the possibility mentioned in paragraph 22 (b) (ii) that air reinforcements may be required for Burma.Modernization of the Defence Forces in India.42. The maintenance in India of a strategic reserve of land forces requires that the organization and equipment of all units forming the reserve shall conform strictly to home standards, in order to enable them to hold their own in opposition to the forces of a first-class Power, and to co-operate effectively with formations from the United Kingdom.Some degree of modernization of the remainder of the Army in India is imperative on the following grounds : (a) Firstly, as regards the British element, in order to obviate the necessityfor re-training not only units but also individuals comprising drafts on arrival in India, and again when they leave India, British troops must be organized and equipped in accordance with Home standards.(b) Secondly, Indian units must conform to some extent to the organizationand equipment of the British element, since units which differ materially in these respects cannot co-operate effectively within the same formation. Moreover, questions of training would present insuperable difficulties if units were not similarly organized and equipped.((c) Thirdly and on this point we understand that the General Staff, India, lay particular emphasis some degree of modernization of the Army in India with resultant increase in its fire-power and mobility, is a necessary corollary to the scheme whereby one division and four additional British infantry battalions are placed unconditionally at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Id) Fourthly, unless units throughout the Army in India are similarly organized and equipped, neither the British nor the Indian units in the strategic reserve division would be interchangeable with other units in India, a state of affairs which could not fail to be detrimental to
their efficiency. There would, in fact, be two distinct armies in India, one modern and the other equipped on a lower standard; the -dis-advantages of such an arrangement are too obvious to require further comment.(e) Fifthly, the Army in India, if modernized, would, as in the Great War, provide a most valuable source of land reserves, over and above the division proposed, in the event of a war in which conditions in India and on the frontiers warranted their release.43. The case for the modernization of the Royal Air Force in India is equally strong.India has an air force equipped with obsolete aircraft and trained in obsolete methods. While this force may be suited to meet the minor frontier commitment, it is quite unable to take its part in a war against a Power equipped with modern aircraft. In addition, a situation cannot continue wherein personnel arriving&apos; from England in India, or vice versa, have to be retrained because of the different types of aircraft maintained. A further important aspect of this problem is the rapidity with which the technical equipment of air forces changes, and the resultant need for re-equipment at comparatively frequent intervals, and in this connection we would point out that the delays arising from the existing administrative arrangements for the purchase of equipment from home militate against the maintenance of an up-to-date standard in the Royal Air Force in India.44. To ensure that the Defence Forces in India can be maintained,, and if necessary expanded, in times of Imperial emergency, we consider it essential that the requisite reserves and sources of supply of warlike material should be built up in India, and that India should be placed as early as possible on a self-sufficient basis so far as may prove to be practicable.Organization and Administration of the Army and Royal Air Force in India.45. The following proposals affecting the organization and administration of the army and air force in India have been made by the representatives of the War Office and Air Ministry respectively : (a) Conditions of service of British Troops.The amenities and conditions of service of the British troops, including personnel of the Royal Air Force, serving in India must not in any respect fall below the standards maintained at home. This question affects the general recruiting situation of the British Army and Royal Air Force, and, in consequence, the ability of the United Kingdom to provide the requisite drafts for units stationed in India and elsewhere abroad. Further  and on this point the War Office lay particular stress the tour of service of the personnel of British units in India should, it is urged, be reduced to 5 years as a maximum.(b) Appointments to Commands and Staffs of the Army in India.(i) The Reserve Division. The War Office consider that, when the Imperial Reserve Division is established; they should be consulted in the nomination of the commanders and staffs of that formation.(ii) Higher Military Appointments. It is, in the War Office view, a matter of importance that the conditions under which the higher military appointments in India are held should be assimilated to those at home, e.g., as regards length of tenure, age of retirement, and methods of appointment as between the Home and Indian authorities.(c) Administration of the Royal Air Force in India.To obviate the difficulties inherent in the present system for the provision of up-to-date equipment for the Royal Air Force in India, the Air,Ministry view is that the Administration, equip-ment and training of the Royal Air Force in India should be undertaken for the Government of India by the Air Ministry on an agency basis.
Part IV. General Summary.46. The general strength of the defence forces in India is still largely based on the strategical situation as it existed fifteen years ago (paragraph 8).47. While the problems of internal security and of tribal control have not undergone any considerable modification, India&apos;s liability to attack across her frontiers has altered in urgency and degree.The dangers to the British Empire as a whole, however, with which India&apos;s security is inextricably connected have materially increased (paragraph 15).48. In order to ensure a reasonable degree of security of Imperial, and therefore Indian, interests the need is apparent for reserves situated to the East of the Mediterranean Basin (paragraph 16).49. While India is the most suitable location for the bulk of the reserves required, one infantry brigade must be located as close to Egypt as possible and Palestine has been accepted by the Committee of Imperial Defence for this purpose (paragraph 24).50. With the exception of four squadrons Royal Air Force which can be made available from Iraq, India is the only available source from which to find the necessary immediate reinforcements for the Middle and Far East in emer-gency (paragraphs 27-29).51. The existing arrangements in accordance with which India provides certain forces for overseas commitments, contingent upon the situation in India at the time permitting their despatch, are unsatisfactory (paragraphs 30-31).52. The Defence Department of the Government of India has made an examination of the existing forces maintained in India in relation to the essential needs of that country (paragraph 32).As a result of our examination of the arguments presented by the Defence Department of the Government of India, we agree : (a) That the strength of the Covering Troops should not be reduced (para-graph 33 (i)).(b) That, since we have not, as a Committee, had the opportunity to examine in detail the whole problem of internal security in India, we are pre-pared to accept the views of the Defence Authorities in India that they can surrender from the Indian establishment the four British Infantry Battalions of the Internal Security Troops which were previously selected for conversion to machine-gun battalions (para-graph 33 (ii)).(c) That one Division (composition given in Appendix C) can be placedunconditionally at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government from the existing strength of the Field Army, but that this will entail the adoption by our land forces of a defensive policy in war with Afghanistan unless the world situation permits His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to place this division under the orders of the Government of India (paragraph 33 (iii)).(d) That it would be in the best interests of the Empire to employ this division on the protection of Imperial communications outside India, accepting the resultant defensive policy in India; but that this will involve additional demands on the air forces in India (para-graph 33 (iii)).(e) That no surrender of Field Artillery, additional to that included in theReserve Division, can be made by India without reducing the artillery strength below the total considered necessary by the Defence Authorities in India (paragraph 33 (iv)).(/) That a force of two Bomber Squadrons, three A.C. Squadrons and one Bomber-Transport Squadron will suffice for tribal operations provided that the aircraft are all of adequate perfoimance and that full use is made of them on the lines laid down in the new Combined Frontier Manual (paragraph 34 (i)).(g) That an addition of four bomber squadrons to the force required for tribal operations is necessary in order to conduct the required offensive
air operations in a war with Afghanistan alone, but that this might prove inadequate if Afghanistan received any serious measure of extraneous assistance (paragraph 34 (ii)).(h) That it is unnecessary to maintain air forces in India specifically for internal security (paragraph 34 (iv) ).(i) That no regular air forces need be maintained specifically for coast defence, but that auxiliary air units should be raised for this role (paragraph 34 (v)). (j) That, unless the air forces in India can be not only modernised but also increased, no surplus can be relied upon to meet the commitments of Imperial defence outside India; and therefore that India&apos;s capacity to meet these commitments must remain, as at present, a contingent liability (paragraph 35).53. The forces which can be made available by the Government of India will provide (paragraph 39) : (a) The Infantry Brigade required in Palestine, made up of three british battalions.(b) A fourth British Battalion for inclusion in the garrison of Malta.(c) Immediate land reinforcements in emergency for :  Egypt. Aden.Anglo-Iranian Oilfields. Singapore.54. Areas which will remain unprovided with land reinforcements from this source include (paragraph 39) :  Burma. Hong Kong.55. Air reinforcements required in the Middle and Far East, total twelve squadrons, of which four can be provided from Iraq unconditionally, and four from India contingent on the situation in India permitting their despatch (paragraphs 40-41).56. Some degree of modernization of the Army in India is imperative for many reasons and is a necessary corollary to the scheme whereby the forces pro-posed are placed unconditionally at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government (paragraph 42).57. The case for the modernization of the Royal Air Force in India is equally strong (paragraph 43).58. India should, as soon as possible, be made self-sufficient in respect of supplies of warlike material so far as may be found practicable (paragraph 44).59. The following points have been brought to our notice during our -enquiry :  (a) By the War Office.(i) Conditions of service for British Troops in India must not in any respect fall below the standards maintained at home, and the tour of service for army personnel should be reduced to 5 years (paragraph 45 (a)). (ii) Conditions under which higher military appointments in India are held should be assimilated to those obtaining at home, and the War Office should be consulted with regard to the nomination of Commanders and Staffs of the Reserve Division (para-graph -45 (b)). --(b) By the Air Ministry.The Air Ministry should undertake the administration, equipment and training of the Royal Air Force units in India on an agency basis (paragraph 45 (c)).
Part V. Conclusions. General.60. Our terms of reference are comprehensive and far-reaching. But within the time at our disposal, it has not been possible to deal with the defence problems of India on any but the broadest lines. For the same reason we have not been able to touch on the composition and organization of the defence forces in India except in the most general terms.Certain broad conclusions, however, emerge from the foregoing brief survey of the problem.61. The changed strategical situation throughout the world and the develop-ment of modern armaments, particularly air forces, have brought into prominence the need for India, in her own interest, to play a more important part in the defence of the vital areas on our Imperial communications in the Middle and Far East.62. India is the area strategically best suited east of the Mediterranean basin for the location of the bulk of the immediate strategic reserves together with their sources of supply; moreover, in present circumstances, and as far ahead as can be foreseen, the forces maintained in India are the only sources from which it may be possible to find these reserves. The forces maintained in India should, therefore, be organized and equipped on the same lines as the Imperial forces alongside whom they will have to fight in war.The Army in India.63. Subject to the acceptance, in the wider interests of Imperial defence as a whole, of a defensive policy on land in the event of war with Afghanistan (and despite its strategic disadvantages) we agree that as far as the Army is concerned the Government of India would be able to meet the requirements of India&apos;s own local defence, even if they released four British battalions for service elsewhere in peace, and accepted an unqualified commitment to provide one division as an Imperial strategic reserve to meet commitments outside India in all circumstances.The acceptance by the Government of India of this reduction of forces should, however, be subject to the condition that a certain measure of moderniza-tion of the Army in India is undertaken with resultant increase in its fire-power and mobility. We agree that the Imperial Reserve Division should be made available for employment under the orders of the Government of India in ah emergency if not required elsewhere.The Air Force in India.64. In respect of the Royal Air Force, the position is different. To enable the air forces in India to accept in all circumstances both the local and Imperial responsibilities which on the new proposed basis can be accepted by the land forces, would involve the maintenance in India of at least fourteen squadrons of up-to-date type, an increase of nearly five squadrons over the strength now main-tained in India. Owing, in part, in the increased responsibility thrown upon the air forces by the modified plan for war against Afghanistan, it is agreed that the minimum force upon which it would be safe to rely in the event of war with Afghanistan combined with widespread frontier disturbances, is a total of ten squadrons; while India&apos;s commitments (at present conditional) in the Middle and Far East amount to four squadrons. It is also essential that these squadrons must be modernized and equipped with up-to-date types.In effect, therefore, unless the air forces in India are modernized and increased to include a full Bomber Transport squadron, they will not be fully adequate to meet the requirements of India&apos;s local defence. A further increase of four squadrons will be necessary if the provision of the four squadrons for Imperial defence which play a profoundly important part in our Imperial war plans is to be other than a contingent liability, a situation which we cannot regard as other than unsatisfactory. Indeed, the ability of India to release land [17443] c 2
forces unconditionally actually reduces the likelihood of the Royal Air Force in India at its present strength being able to release the immediate air reinforce-ments required.. 65. We must point out the marked disparity between the capacity of India&apos;s land forces and that of her air forces as at present existing to meet the require-ments of her own local defence and at the same time to provide reinforcements for vital areas overseas.66. Finally, India cannot make the necessary provision for her security in all contingencies if or instance, in the event of aggression by a major Power  without Imperial assistance. On the other harld, India&apos;s contribution is vitally important to Imperial defence as a whole.It is evident, therefore, that the defence of India cannot be considered as a self-contained problem.We consider it very desirable, therefore, that the machinery of the Committee -of Imperial Defence should be more fully utilised for the purpose of co-ordinating the defence of India with the defence of the Empire as a whole.We understand that some advance has been made in India towards bringing ^fche higher direction of defence matters more into line with the system in force in London. We attach great importance to further developments in this direction.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee :H. R.

Memorandum on the Constitutional Position of the Defence Forces in India.1. The interpretation generally given to the duties of the Governor-General and the Commander-in-Chief regarding the defence of India, as laid down in the Government of India Act 1935 and by various commissions, is as follows : All executive authority in matters of Defence is vested in the Governor-General, subject only to the control of the Secretary of State for India as representing His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Governor-General is enjoined to consult the Commander-in-Chief on any matter affecting the discharge of the latter&apos;s duties. The Commander-in-Chief holds a Warrant from the King and is not subject to control by the War Office. This is inherent in the position as just described, and is recognised in War Office Instructions, paragraph 130, which lays down that &quot; dii&apos;ect correspondence between the War Office and India will be limited to questions relating to intelligence, training, preparation for war, and the routine matters and minor questions of organization and equipment. It will not extend to questions on principle or policy. . . . Executive action will not be taken on such correspondence.&quot;2. As regards the strength of the Defence Forces in India, the situation is well summarized in Volume II of the Simon Commission Report which reads as follows :  &quot; The objects for which the Army in India exists are the defence of *    India against exteimal aggression and the maintenance of internal order. The size of the Army to secure these objects is not, as is sometimes imagined, fixed by the War Office or the Army Council; it is fixed on the advice of the Commander-in-Chief in India and of the Government of India, of which he is a member.   Constitutionally speaking, this means that the authority ultimately responsible for deciding the strength of the Army in India is the Secretary of State.   If some question of great importance connected with the Army in India arises, it may come before the Cabinet, and the * Cabinet may seek the advice of the Committee of Imperial Defence, though of course responsibility for the decision reached rests with the Cabinet. ,*&apos;,*** * *In the Cabinet, where, of course, the final decision is taken, the Secretary of State for War has no overriding power; he is, like the Secretary of State for India, a member of the Cabinet taking his share in the joint responsi-bility for what is decided, but with the important distinction that, if Indian revenues are involved, no acquiescence on the part of the Secretary of State for India can be effective without the concurrence of the majority of the Council of India.&quot;The Council of India has now been replaced by a body of Advisers occupying a different constitutional position, but during what is called the &quot; transitional period &quot; that is, pending the inauguration of federation the Secretary of State cannot over-rule the Government of India in matters involving expenditure from Indian revenues without the concurrence of his Advisers.Appendix C to Annex No. 2.The Imperial Reserve in India.

Assumption.1. (a) That the role of the Army in India remains &quot; the defence of India against external aggression and the maintenance of internal peace.&quot;(b) That the prosecution of war against Afghanistan is the principal commitment of the army and air forces in India.(c) That, in the event of war against Afghanistan and in order to force the Afghans to sue for peace on terms&apos; acceptable to ourselves, it remains our policy to undertake a land offensive against Afghanistan, provided circumstances permit.2. In our plan of operations for war against Afghanistan, when the complete Field Army is available, it is the function of the Field Army and the Royal Air Force to carry out offensive operations into enemy territory. It is the function of the Covering Troops to control the frontier tribes, to cover the mobilization and concentration of the Field Army, and, subsequently, when the Field Army has advanced into Afghanistan, to protect its lines of communication through tribal territory.
3. In many respects the functions of the Field Army and the Covering-Troops are correlated; without the Covering Troops the Field Army could neither -concentrate nor take the offensive, whereas the offensive action of the Field Army should relieve enemy pressure on the Covering Troops.4. As the Covering Troops must be prepared to operate immediately on the outbreak of war, if, indeed, they are not engaged in restoring peace in tribal territory prior to hostilities beginning, it follows that they must, for the most part, be in situ in peace, organized and ready to take the field at short notice.5. Although from time to time certain areas in tribal territory are more likely to be the scene of disturbances than others, there can be no question of holding the Covering Troops concentrated ready to operate when and where disturbances may occur. Apart from it being essential to localise disturbances from the outset, the nature of the country and the paucity and vulnerability of communications render the dispersion of the Covering Troops unavoidable. They are, therefore, disposed primarily to deal with local situations, and they cannot be moved from one part of the frontier to another without endangering its general security.The principle followed is to provide for minimum garrisons to hold places of military importance and to maintain in each area a mobile column, of a strength capable of operating against the tribes in the vicinity. These garrisons and columns also serve as a reserve to the civil armed forces, on whom fall, in normal times, the duties of policing the tribal areas.6. The allotment and distribution of the Covering Troops in war were thoroughly examined in 1931 by the Howell Committee, who were unable to suggest more than a few minor reductions, which have since been carried out. Conditions since 1931 have not improved to an extent which would justify any reduction in the strength of these garrisons to-day. In fact, the events of the past year in Waziristan have shown that the Covering Troops alone cannot be relied upon in all circumstances to carry out their task and may have to be reinforced to a considerable extent by formations of the Field Army. A similar state of affairs arose in 1935, during the Mohmand operations, when two brigades of the Field Army had to be employed to reinforce the Covering Troops of the Peshawar District.7. In spite of improvements that have been made from time to time in our organization, training and equipment, the operations of the past year have shown that these advantages are largely offset by the improved armament of the tribesmen and the more effective tactics they are adopting in the conduct of tribal warfare.8. These considerations indicate that the problem to be faced will become increasingly difficult as time passes, and it seems possible that the Covering Troops, instead of being reduced, might have to be increased.9. From our detailed examination of the question the following conclusions emerge ; (a) There is no possibility of reducing the Covering Troops in the Peshawar and Kohat Districts except, perhaps, in so far as the small detachment in Chitral is concerned.* In both Districts there is a real and ever-present danger of tribal and/or Afghan incursions. In addition, in the Peshawar District there is an internal security problem which in itself is always likely to necessitate the maintenance of a considerable number of troops in readiness to act in aid of the civil power. . (b) The &quot; forward policy &quot; having been put into effect in Waziristan, there is no possibility of reducing the number of troops in that district. In fact, in order to maintain our existing garrisons and communications during serious disturbances, it is certain that this district will have to be reinforced.&apos;(c) In Baluchistan and the Zhob the abandonment of the&quot; forward policy,&quot; which has been so successful during the past 50 years, would be a retrograde step for which there could be no justification.   The main-:* The Political Department is, however, strongly opposed to reducing this detachment.
tenance of a satisfactory position in this district admits of no reduction of the garrison of Baluchistan below the level of three Covering Troops brigades.10. In the conditions which would obtain if the number of Field Army divisions were reduced from three to two by the withdrawal from India of an Imperial Reserve equivalent to one division, the task of the Covering Troops, in the event of war against Afghanistan, would be just as important and far more exacting. In these conditions, our land forces would have to stand on the defensive, and. in consequence, Afghan incursions across the border would be likely to become more frequent and determined, spreading tribal disaffection wherever the Afghan forces penetrated. If the Covering Troops were not in sufficient strength and suitably placed to meet hostile incursions and to deal promptly with tribal outbreaks, a really, dangerous situation would be likely to arise.Appendix E to Annex No. 2.The British Element in Internal Security Troops.Object of the British element.1. There are two reasons for retaining a proportion of British troops in the forces allotted for internal security : (a) To aid the civil power in the maintenance of law and order in anti-government and communal disputes.(b) To protect the lives and interests of Europeans and Anglo-Indians during a state of open rebellion.Recent proposed reductions in the British element.2. As a result of all the reorganization schemes, either approved or proposed, including the proposal to give up four British battalions, the British troops allotted to internal security in war will be reduced by the following units : 1 British cavalry regiment.4 British infantry battalions.2 British light tank companies.15 British field artillery sections.3. In addition, the strength of a British infantry battalion will be reduced by 93 men from 863 (the present peace establishment of a mixed battalion) to 770 men (the latest proposed peace establishment for a rifle battalion). Actually the average strength of British battalions is at present considerably below 770 owing to the suspension of holding. The number of British troops allotted to internal security will have been reduced by approximately 30 per cent, from 24,000 to 17,000.British troops allotted to internal security.4. There will be no British cavalry, artillery or tanks, and only 22 British infantry battalions allotted to internal security. These 22 battalions will be spread over the whole of India, an area of 1-1 million square miles with a population of more than&apos;350 millions, that is to say, one British soldier to every 20,000 inhabitants and N to every 88 square miles.5. The situation at present is that the British battalions are located at the main political and industrial centres, from fourteen of which detachments have to be made to other centres of importance. For example, in war the battalion at Nasirabad has to detach companies distances of 300 miles to Ahmedabad and Mhow. There are not sufficient British troops available to find detachments for many of the important industrial centres, such as Patna, Tatanagar and Sholapur. and there are many vast areas containing practically no British troops.   For
instance, except at Calcutta, there are no British troops located in Bengal or Assam, and the only British unit in Bihar and Orissa is half a battalion at Dinapore.All British internal security troops are allotted to specific tasks, and no-general reserve exists.6. During recent years transport facilities throughout India have been greatly improved. This improvement is of material assistance in suppressing internal disorders, since reinforcements can reach the scene of trouble more quickly. Distances in India, however, are very great, and even with improved transport facilities serious and dangerous delay may occur before the troops can arrive at places where they are wanted. If troops are not on the spot or readily available when a disturbance breaks out, the trouble may spread very rapidly. Moreover, the mere presence of troops in a dangerous area is likely to prevent any trouble occurring. Within the last nine months we have asked commands to examine the possibility of reducing detachments from British battalions or of replacing them by Indian troops. No further reductions or replacements were considered possible.In addition, it is necessary to consider India as a whole. Although it is unlikely that there will be trouble throughout the whole of India at once, disturbances spread over wide areas are not improbable. For instance, serious anti-British risings might occur simultaneously in the Punjab, the United Provinces, Bihar and Bengal. In such circumstances, even taking credit for the improved transport facilities, it is doubtful whether the troops which would remain available for internal security duties on general mobilization would suffice for the suppression of serious internal disorder.The communal problem.7. A very large percentage of the disturbances that have occurred since 1918 have been of a communal nature, and since the Congress party is basically Hindu, and political parties are now aligned mainly on a communal basis, serious communal riots will be even more probable in the future.Disturbances of this kind cannot as a rule be dealt with by Indian units, unless supported by British troops, and it is, therefore, essential to retain an adequate quota of British troops whose impartiality is universally recognised. Widespread communal trouble in the Punjab might even infect the Indian army, a very large proportion of which is recruited from this province.Protection of European and Anglo-Indian lives and interests.8. The openly avowed object of the extremist section of the Congress party is to drive the British out of India, and this section has publicly stated that it will take advantage of any war in which India is directly or indirectly involved to further its ends by revolutionary methods. It is also part of Congress policy to create disaffection in the Indian army, and its recent efforts to this end have been concentrated mainly in the recruiting areas of the Punjab. Further the steady progress of Indianization must tend to increase the danger of disaffection in certain units of the Indian army. And, lastly, in seven of the provinces, the police are now directly under the control of Congress governments.9. Taking all these factors into consideration, we have to be prepared to meet a situation in which the Field Army is absent, and in which the Congress party has adopted an openly hostile attitude to the presence of the British in India and has succeeded in partially undermining the loyalty of the police and to a lesser extent that of the Indian army. Should such a situation occur over the whole of India, the 22 battalions available would be inadequate for the task of protecting British interests, and even if only parts of India were involved, it is very doubtful whether these 17,000 British soldiers, backed by that portion of the Indian army on whose loyalty we were able to depend, would be sufficient to protect the lives and interests of Europeans and Anglo-Indians scattered over vast areas often with indifferent communications.Possibility of replacing British internal security troops by a British gendarmerie.10. For the fulfilment of their first task, namely, aid to the civil power in the maintenance of law and order in communal disputes, it may be argued that British rifle battalions are armed with weapons which are unnecessarily powerful
and expensive. Their substitution by a British gendarmerie would be unlikely, liowever, to allow any appreciable reduction, if any reduction at all, to be made in the number of personnel required, since, although the gendarmerie would be -specially trained in police duties, it is largely numbers that count in dealing with a vast area and an enormous population.It is unlikely that the formation of a gendarmerie force would result in -opening fresh fields of recruitment for the regular forces, or in providing materially for the employment of time-expired soldiers, since, unless exceptionally Tiigh pay were offered as an inducement, the men who would be suitable and ready to. join the gendarmerie would be equally suitable and ready to join or continue in the army. Further, although there might be a reduction in overhead charges and cost of equipment, it is doubtful whether, in comparison with the maintenance *of regular units, the formation of a highly paid gendarmerie would result in any cash saving to Government.A specialised force of this kind, as distinct from a general utility force of British battalions, would, moreover, be economically unsound,11. Politically, there would be serious difficulties to the formation of a British gendarmerie. The object of such a force could only be publicly stated .as the maintenance of law and order, and, constitutionally, the force should come under provincial control. If it were under provincial control, the responsibility for its efficiency would rest with ministers for law and order, who might belong to the Congress left wing and be interested mainly in getting rid of it. It would, therefore, be essential to break away from the constitution, and insist that the gendarmerie should remain under central control, and, in fact, form part of the defence forces.Although most officials, including Indians, agree that British personnel are, on account of their obvious impartiality, best suited for dealing with communal -disturbances, it is unlikely that any Congress government or politician would accept the formation of a British gendarmerie for the maintenance of law and -order, and any suggestion to inaugurate the force would be likely to precipitate .a first-class political crisis. The Central Government, when introducing the measure, might be accused, firstly, of mistrusting Indians; secondly, of saddling the country with a useless and expensive burden; and, thirdly, of intending to use the gendarmerie force to support the governors&apos; special powers by the introduction, at any time, of a &apos;&quot;&apos; Black and Tan &quot; regime in India.12. The second task of the British element, namely, the protection of European and Anglo-Indian lives and interests in the event of serious trouble amounting to a rebellion, could not be undertaken by a gendarmerie. The force, though adequate to deal with communal trouble or ordinary mob action of anti-British type, would be incapable of protecting British civilians, and loyalists generally, in the event of rebellion accompanied by the disaffection of better trained and equipped Indian units. Fully armed and trained British internal security battalion? would be essential to deal with a contingency of this nature.Conclusion.13. The safety of the European and Anglo-Indian lives and interests in India is ultimately dependent on the British element in the internal security troops. Under existing proposals this British element will be reduced by 30 per cent, at a time when the internal situation in India contains more potential dangers than it has since 1857.In offering this reduction the Government of India is taking a risk, which can only be justified having regard to the urgent needs of the Empire in the existing world situation. It must be realized that, in the event of serious internal disorder, field army reserves may have to be called upon to reinforce intern^ security troops. - &quot;
m -45Appendix F to Annex No. 2.The Defence of India in a contingency tvhen an Imperial Reserve Division r drawn from, the normal resources of the Army in India, is not available-for operations.T.   Assumption. This paper is based on the following hypotheses : (a) that Afghanistan is hostile and has started, or is threatening, aggressionon the North-West Frontier;(b) that, consequent upon Afghan hostility, disaffection throughout ourfrontier tribes is widespread and active.(c) that there is a possibility of covert military assistance, including the-provision of aircraft and pilots, being given to Afghanistan by an unfriendly power.(d) that the Afghan forces, with the covert assistance of an unfriendly Power,may use gas against us.(e) that, consequent upon a world upheaval and the threat of a dangerous situation arising on the frontier, there is a very real risk of anti-British elements creating serious trouble in internal India. (/) that the coasts of India are liable to seaborne and seaborne air attack.2. The attitude of the Afghan Government. The present friendly attitude of the Afghan Government may, in any case, prove to be only temporary, and there is the danger that the feeling and policy of that Government may, in time of an Imperial emergency, change under pressure and persuasion by Germany, Italy and even Japan. We must anticipate, therefore, the possibility of a hostilej Afghanistan at a time when the Empire is engaged in a major war; and our preparations to meet that contingency must be adequate and complete. I3. Disaffection throughout the frontier tribes. We have to accept the fact that the Afghan Government, by proclaiming Jehad and by expending compara-tively small sums of money, are able to inflame the frontier at will. Active Afghan hostility would, without any doubt whatever, be followed by widespread disaffection among our frontier tribes.4. The internal Security problem. The problem of maintaining strict law and order in India proper would be increasingly difficult and doubly important on the occasion of an Empire war, more especially if Indian troops were despatched overseas in Imperial interests. Moreover, the internal security problem in relation to the Mohammedan element of the Indian population would be rendered still more difficult if the Kingdom of Afghanistan proclaimed a religious war against the infidel British/Indian Government.5. Coast Defences. In the contingency envisaged the ports of India would be liable to sporadic sea-borne and sea-borne air attack by one or two major sea powers. The sea-borne invasion of India is unlikely to be attempted so long as a British fleet is in being in Eastern waters; but sea-borne raids by landing parties are possible especially at ports, such as Cochin, which are entirely undefended.6.   Conclusion.(a) Active Afghan hostility is not unlikely in the event of an Empire war.(b) Widespread tribal hostility under the banner of &quot;Jehad&quot; would bean inevitable corollary to a hostile Afghan Govrenment. It would be impossible therefore, to relax precautions by withdrawing forces&apos; from the Covering Troops. In fact, it would be necessary to reinforce them.(c) On the occasion of an Empire war, the maintenance of strict law andorder in India proper would be more important than ever, and the problem of ensuring internal peace would become increasingly difficult if the Afghan Government proclaimed a religious war against us. The normal quota of Internal Security Troops allotted in peace could not be reduced. In grave circumstances it might be necessary to increase them.
(d) It would be necessary to arrange for the provision of air forces for coast defence, for the reinforcement of the garrisons at our major ports and for the provision of troops for the defence of certain other ports at which no garrison is normally located.(e) It would be necessary to provide the means to retaliate in kind if gasshould be used against us.7. Existing Plan of Operations for War against Afghanistan assuming that the normal Army garrison and the Air Forces normally stationed in India (as at present time) are available. In a recent appreciation the General Staff in India have arrived at the following main conclusions as regards the conduct of war -against Afghanistan : -(a) In the initial phase of a campaign an air offensive would be launched to destroy the air resources of the Afghan Government, to hinder the mobilisation of the Afghan regular forces and to deter the Afghan Government from pursuing hostilities further.(b) In addition to the air offensive, a main land offensive would be conducted on the Northern Line only, with a view to inflicting a decisive defeat on the enemy&apos;s forces in the field.The main land offensive would be undertaken by two divisions and one cavalry brigade supported, as circumstances might allow, by a third division, whose initial and primary role would be to reinforce the Covering Troops in the suppression of tribal disturbances.(c) The land offensive on the Northern Line would be supplemented by alimited offensive on the Southern Line conducted by the Covering Troops of the Baluchistan District reinforced by two cavalry brigades.(d) Security measures for the protection of our vital areas against air attack by the provision of aircraft and A.A. defences are an essential feature of the plan.8. Effect on our existing war plans if the strength of the existing Field Army were reduced by one Division. If the Imperial Reserve Division were not available to fulfil its part in the General Staff war plans, the strength of the Field Army would be reduced to two and one-third divisions and three cavalry brigades. As already explained it would not, in any conceivable circumstances, be possible to augment the Field Army by withdrawing brigade formations or even individual units from the Covering Troops or from the forces allotted to internal security. Initially, and in order to take active and effective measures to deal with tribal hostility, it would in fact be necessary to detail one complete division to reinforce the Covering Troops, and, in grave circumstances, it might be necessary to reinforce the troops allotted to internal security.9. Retaining, as would be essential, one infantry brigade at least in G.H.Q. reserve, and reinforcing the troops in Baluchistan, according to the General Staff plan, by two cavalry brigades, the balance which would be available for a main land offensive on the Northern Line would be one division and one cavalry brigade. Having regard to the necessity of detaching troops for the protection of its line of communication, this comparatively small force could make only a very limited advance into enemy territory; and it could not reach any important strategic objective as Jalalabad, and at the same time strike hard and in superior strength against the hostile forces which would certainly oppose it. By staging a strategic offensive with a force of this size we would, in fact, be expending energy to no very material purpose. A deliberate, advance into Afghanistan would, for these reasons, be an unsound plan, and the most we could do would be to undertake local offensives with strictly limited objectives into enemy territory.10. The effect of standing on the defensive with our land forces would be likely to result in bringing more hostile elements actively into the field against us and to strike at the yroot. of our prestige. Afghan incursions across the border would be likely to increase, spreading tribal disaffection wherever they were undertaken.The initiative in so,far as the action of land, forces is concerned would be surrendered to the enemy, and the Field Army would be fully occupied in main-taining our position in Waziristan, and in other frontier districts in protecting the administrative border against hostile incursion.
4711. Afghan incursions. Afghan incursions might occur at many points,, namely : into Mohmand country; through the Tirah towards the Peshawar Valley;. via Parachinar and the Kaitu Valley into the Kurram Agency; into the Tochi Valley in North Waziristan; via the Gonial Valley &quot;into South Waziristan; via the Toba plateau in Baluchistan; and into the Zhob.12. Consideration as regards action by land forces. -The disposition of our Field Army formations best suited to deal actively and offensively with Afghan incursions and tribal risings, as they occur, cannot be determined until the. contingency arises. Speaking generally, it is probable that one Field Army Division and one cavalry brigade would, in the worst circumstances, be required to reinforce the troops in the Peshawar District, a second division for operations in the Kohat and Waziristan Districts, and two cavalry brigades to assist the normal Baluchistan garrison to deal with incursions and tribal disaffection on the Southern Line and in the Zhob. The balance available in G.H.Q. reserve would be one infantry brigade and attached troops only. It would not be advisable, however, to distribute the available forces in this way until the enemy, who would possess the initiative, showed his hand, but it might be wise, as soon as the attitude of the Afghan Government and the position on the frontier became threatening, to send one cavalry brigade to Baluchistan, and one infantry brigade, of the Field Army to both the Peshawar and Waziristan Districts.; 13. There is little doubt that with the reduced land forces available it would be within our power to protect Indian administered territory against hostile invasion; but our adoption of an essentially defensive policy would not bring the Afghan Government to terms. It would be necessary to compensate for the comparatively defensive attitude of our land forces by a vigorous and sustained air offensive from the outset of the war.14. Considerations as regards action by air forces. The institution and maintenance of an air offensive as the principal, and for all practical purposes, the sole means of bringing the Afghan Government to terms acceptable to ourselves would entail: (a) a firm guarantee that India would have available first-line aircraftgreater in number than, and superior in performance to, the aircraft which the Afghan Government, with foreign assistance, could put in the air against us.(b) the removal of certain restrictions which are now imposed on the applica-tion of air power against a tribal enemy.15. General Conchisions.(a) The reduction of one division from the Field Army in India would, inthe event of war aganist Afghanistan combined with wide-spread disaffection among our frontier tribes, entail the surrender to the enemy of the initiative in so far as the operation of land forces is concerned.(b) With the reduced forces available, we could secure the administereddistricts of British India against hostile invasion.(c) It would not be possible to augment the Field Army by reducing thestrength of the Covering Troops or the troops allotted to internal security.(d) The adoption of a defensive policy would not bring the Afghan Govern-ment to terms acceptable to ourselves.(e) It would be necessary to compensate for the comparatively defensiveattitude of our land forces by undertaking vigorous and sustained air offensive from the outbreak of the war. (/) Certain restrictions which are now imposed on the application of airpower against a tribal enemy would have to be removed. (g) We should be in a position to retaliate in kind if gas is used by the enemyagainst us.
ANNEX No. 3.Inter-Departmental Committee on Indian Defence Questions. Financial A ppreciation.The Inter-departmental Committee on Indan Defence Questions, at its first meeting on the 25th April, 1938, appointed a sub-committee, with Major-General H. R. Pownall as Chairman, to report on the defence problems of India and to make recommendations for the future composition and organisation of both the Army and the Royal Air Force in India.At its second meeting, on the 19th May, the Committee considered the report of its sub-committee, and agreed that representatives of the War Office, the Air Ministry, the India Office and the Government of India should at once confer with a view to submitting an appreciation of the financial implications of that report, read in conjunction with the Government of India&apos;s letter of the 9th February, 1938, setting out the military deficiencies programme in India (the &quot; 20 crore &quot; programme).I. Army.The financial questions involved, so far as the Army is concerned, may be set out under three heads : (1) The sub-committee&apos;s recommendation that India should release four british battalions for service elsewhere in peace. (2) The  sub-committee&apos;s  recommendation  that India should accept an unqualified commitment to provide one division as an Imperialstrategic   reserve   to  meet   commitments   outside   India   in   all circumstances.(3) The recommendations in the Government of India&apos;s letter of the 9th February addressed to the modernisation and improvement of the preparedness for war of the Army and Air Force in India (both British and Indian). The two recommendations of the sub-committee referred to above were made conditional upon some such measures of modernisation of the Army in India.The following are the financial implications involved : (A) The additional annual cost to Army funds of four British infantry battalions (727 all ranks), three in Palestine and one in Malta, may be taken at about  570,000 (effective), plus some  50,000 eventual non-effective charges. This figure covers all effective charges other than accommodation and allows for new rates of pay, &amp;c, that have already been approved. The capital cost to Army funds of barrack accommodation in Palestine and Malta may be taken as  350,000- 400,000 with annual maintenance charges of  18,500.The corresponding saving to Indian funds assuming a battalion establish-ment of 891 all ranks may be put at  640,000 (effective), with an eventual non-effective saving of  60,000 and some saving on barrack maintenance. It should, however, be pointed out that there is at present, owing to the abolition of holding, an average shortage of about 160 other ranks a battalion : on this basis the saving to India is reduced by about  100,000.Major-General PownalFs sub-committee state that the War Office had asked for the release by India, in addition, of two mechanised Field Artillery Brigades, but that India did not accept this suggestion. It may, however, be mentioned that the saving to India by releasing each Field Brigade would amount to some  145,000 (effective) calculated on a similar basis to the figures above, and  10,000 (non-effective). The corresponding additional cost to Army Funds would be approximately  89,000 &quot;(effective);and  9,500 (non-effective): but, since brigades Teleased by India would be horsed, additional capital expenditure on mechaniza-tion would be involved.(B) As regards the division which, it is suggested, should be earmarked for use as a general Imperial reserve in emergency, the capital cost of modernising and equipping a division, to the standard aimed at for the British army at home, is estimated by the Indian authorities at about  11 million.   The figure covers-
the Infantry organized on the new war establishment, and three mechanized Field Artillery Brigades of 16 guns each; but it excludes the cost of making good deficiencies in the existing level of war maintenance reserves (see paragraph (D), second sub-paragraph) and of increasing those reserves to the (War Office) Middle East scale. Even so, the figure appears low to the War Office, as they have estimated that for material and ammunition alone for four divisions of the Field Force the cost would be some  50 millions. It must, however, be borne in mind that the scale of equipment, reserves, &amp;c, covered by the latter figure is in many respects higher than the basis underlying the Indian estimate above. Without considerable delay and reference to India it would not be possible to reconcile in detail the differences in the estimates and in the scales of equipment, reserves, &amp;c.It is impossible, if the financial implications are to be fully appreciated, -entirely to ignore the question of possible incidence of charges.&quot; The annual maintenance cost of a division modernized and equipped on the above lines is put by the Indian authorities at  2,500,000 (effective) and  300,000 (eventual non-effective), and these sums would probably be claimed by the Government of India, less, say,  1,250,000 in respect of that part of the&apos;subsidy paid by the Imperial Government under the Gar ran Tribunal award in recognition of the contingent undertaking of the Government of India to furnish reinforcements in emergency for service outside India.(C) With regard to the modernisation of the Army in India, the Indian Government propose that the respective establishments of British, and Indian units (so far as numbers and general organisation are concerned) should not be -different in the earmarked &quot; Imperial&quot; division from those in the rest of the Army in India; but that units and formations in the latter should not in all respects be brought up to the standard of modernisation or scale of equipment regarded as necessary for the &quot; Imperial&quot; division. The Government of India have assessed, on this basis, the capital cost of modernising the Army in India at a figure of about  5,500,000, excluding the cost of making good deficiencies in the existing level of war maintenance reserves (see paragraph (D), second sub-paragraph, below).As regards the maintenance costs of the modernised Army in India, the Government of India estimate that there is an increase of some  120,000 a year for the &quot;Imperial&quot; division, which is included in the figure given for that division under (B) above, and for the troops (British and Indian) outside that division that there is an extra cost, compared with the existing establishment, of about  150,000 a year. It should be borne in mind, however, that, owing to the abolition of holding, British units are at present short of about 9,000 of their present establishment numbers; owing to this shortage, the further financial effect -of making up numbers to the reorganised establishment (811 all ranks of an Infantry battalion) would be an addition of  1,000,000 to the amount of India&apos;s -defence budget for 1938-39.A further point to mention is that, when the fifth cavalry regiment in India i3 withdrawn to the United Kingdom, and the remainder of the Bcyal Tank &quot;Corps is withdrawn, Indian defence estimates will be relieved of maintenance -charges to the amount of about  250,000. The corresponding addition to Army -estimates has been allowed for in the recent forecast of &quot; conspectus &quot; expendi-ture for the Army over the next four years.(D) The Government of India representative stated that the modernisation -of the Army in India could not be considered, in the view of the Government of India, apart from the programme for new ordnance factories in India which, would be necessary to provide that Army with reserve of munitions. The Govern-ment of India prpposed the spending of some  5 millions on the capital cost of such factories.He mentioned also that a committee set up by the Government of India had recently recommended that additional war reserves should be accumulated, at a capital cost of  3,750,000; there were also under active consideration measures for Anti-aircraft defence in India (mostly for the ports) which would cost about  1 million (capital) and  250,000 (recurring).(E) The representative of the Government of India made it clear that the Government of Indians view was that it could not contemplate any increase of the amount provided in the current (1938) Indian Defence Estimates, amounting to 45 crores ( 33,750,000).
In this connection account would have to be taken of the increased costs-involved in applying the improvements in pay and conditions of service of British troops to the establishment in India ( 1,250,000 a year). Further, such proposals of the Willingdon Committee as may be implemented will still further, both directly and indirectly, increase the cost of the Army in India beyond the 45 crore standard.II. Royal Air Force.At the present time, apart from headquarters formations, the operational units of the Royal Air Force in India are 4 Bomber Squadrons,4 Army Co-operation Squadrons,\ Bomber Transport Flight.It is proposed in the Pownall report that, in addition to any units that may be stationed in India as an Imperial strategic reserve, the operational units ih that country should be 6 Bomber Squadrons, ,3 Army Co-operation Squadrons,1 Bomber Transport Squadron (two flights),and that these should be equipped with up-to-date aircraft.The first-line strength of each of the Bomber and Army Co-operation Squadrons is 12 aircraft, and that of a full Bomber Transport flight. 4; and it is not suggested that this scale should be modified.The reserves maintained behind the first line are 100 per cent, of first-line airframes,150 per cent, of first-line engines,100 per cent, of airscrews, &amp;c,60 per cent, of equipments.In addition to the squadrons, there are, as ancillary units, an Aircraft Depot and an Aircraft Park, besides Command, Group, Wing and Station headquarters.An increase in the number of squadrons and their re-equipment with up-to-date aircraft would undoubtedly entail an increase in the size of the ancillary units, and probably the enlargement and modernising of existing&apos; aerodromes and stations.Capital Cost.It is understood that the India Office calculate that the capital cost of re-equipping and enlarging the Force as proposed would be approximately  .(a) 3,772,000* For aircraft and equipment.(b) 1,600,000   For enlargement, &amp;c, of stations, modernising landingfacilities.Total 5,372,000The Air Ministry are not in a position to give any estimates of the cost of improving the aerodromes and modernising landing facilities in India (item (bj above); but they are of opinion that the estimate for providing modern aircraft and equipment (including mechanical transport) of all the 10 Squadrons now proposed should be about  4,600,000, this sum including approximately  400,000 for transportation to India and the usual percentage additions for departmental expenses, as well as provision for a stock of airframe and engine spares. This estimate is based on the scale of reserves given above, but the reserves laid down for RAP. squadrons in other overseas commands are 200 per cent, for all items except engines where the scale is 225 per cent. If this scale were adopted, the capital cost would be increased by about another  2,000,000 and, further, accom-modation (the cost of which cannot be, calculated in the Air Ministry) would be required for storing these extra reserves. None of these figures makes allowance for a reserve of bombs, small arm ammunition or of petrol.* Excluding  423,000 available in R.A.F. (India) Sinking Fund.
The types of aircraft and engines on which the above estimates are based are as follows : Air frame. Engine.Bomber Squadrons    ...      ...      Blenheim  ...      Mercury VIII (2)Army Co-operation Squadrons      Beaufort   ...      Taurus (2) Bomber Transport Squadron      Valentia   ...      Pegasus II.L.3. (2)It is to be observed that in the Estimates Valentias have been assessed at a second-hand value.  No further Valentias are being ordered.Prom the foregoing statement it will be seen that the Air Ministry&apos;s estimates -of the capital cost of increasing the Royal Air Force in India to 10 Squadrons, modernising its equipment, together with the cost of improving aerodromes and landing facilities, but excluding the suggested Volunteer Air Force for coastal reconnaissance, are : -(*) (b)With Existing.

The Air Ministry lacks some of the data necessary for compilation of an estimate of maintenance and running costs in India, but so far as experience in other. overseas commands can be taken as a guide, it is agreed that, on the existing scale of reserves in India, this estimate can be accepted.Strategic Reserve.- There is also a suggestion in the Pownall Report (paragraph 64, second sub-paragraph), that an additional 4 Squadrons should be maintained in India, because India&apos;s acceptance of a liability to provide air reinforcements to external areas is contingent and not absolute. The cost of this additional provision cannot be calculated in the absence of a statement of detailed requirements, e.g., the type of aircraft to be adopted..; III. Summary.-      The position may be summarised as follows : Capital Expenditure Directly flowing from the Pownall Report :   Sea Transport for the 4 battalions    ...      ...      .... 17,000Modernization of &quot;Imperial&quot; Division      ...       ... 1,500,000Modernization of rest of British and Indian armies in India       .................. 5,500,000Factories in India ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 5,000,000Barrack Accommodation for 4 Infantry Battalions ... 350,000Other proposals before the Government of India : Additional War Reserves        ............ 3,750,000Balance of 20 crore programme!  not  covered  hythe above     ...       ............... 5,900,000A.A.

Annual Expenditure (and in order to make the picture clear certain? incidence has been assumed that neither the Government of India nor the British Government have, agreed to). The effect on British Funds is related to the provision in the forecast of Army and Air Estimates for the next four years recently furnished to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Indian Increased Cost and Savings are taken in relation to an Indian Defence Estimate of 45 crores. -	British FundB.		Indian Funds.		Increased cost.	Saving.	Increased cost.

(These figures do not allow for any increased costs whether on account of prices or of policy in the future or the expansion of the Royal Indian Navy and local naval defence.)May 28, 1938.
