TWENTY-FIFTH REPORT.Survey of the economic situation, June 1938.BY our terms of reference we are directed to supervise the preparation of periodical reports on the economic situation; and in accordance with these instructions we now submit the twenty-fifth of these periodical reports. The report represents the general views of the committee, without attempting to. express the different shades of opinion held by individual members.2. In part 1, we summarise the chief economic events of recent months. In part 2, we discuss the prospecta of a revival of trade in the United States.3. While our report was being completed, our Chairman paid a visit to the United States. We annexe to this report a note in which he has recorded the conclusions which he has reached as to the outlook in that country as a consequence of conversations held in the course of his visit.(Signed on behalf of the committee):STAMP, Chairman.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, June 27,1938(17368]
SURVEY OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION, JUNE 1938.Part 1. Summary of recent economic events.(a) Finance.     ;     .THERE have been a number of important developments of a financial character since our last review of economic events in October of last year. In the last quarter of 1937 and in the first two months of 1938 British and European balances in the United States, built up in the previous summer by the sale of gold to the American Treasury, were drawn upon to a very considerable extent. For this there were two reasons. In the first place some part of the refugee capital which had been transferred out of gold into dollars and sterling in the summer 1937 was reinvested in gold, and continental funds were withdrawn to Switzerland and the Netherlands. Secondly, the United States balance of payments On current account, which had probably been unfavourable in the first half of 1937, became strongly favourable towards the end of that year. Both these factors are attributable to the depression of trade originating in the United States. For confidence in the dollar as a refuge for short-term funds in a period of depression in the United States was effected by recollections of the policy pursued in 1933 and 1934; and the curtailment of commercial buying in the United States had a direct effect on the American balance of payments. The level of the dollar-sterling exchange was influenced by the return of funds to the continent and the hoarding demand for gold in London. For the price of gold in London had to fall to a .point at which gold supplies were diverted from London to the continent, whereas previously gold had been flowing from the continent to London; and at the same time the hoarding demand for gold in London in excess of the new supplies avail-able in the market led to a rise in the London price relative to the&apos;New York price.1 This involved a depreciation of the dollar relative to sterling. The dollar was relatively weak from November to February. In March the flow of funds was influenced by the threatening political developments in Europe, and there was a-, recovery in the value of the dollar, which was maintained in April and May. The franc exchange was stable during the last quarter of 1937, thanks to a temporary revival of confidence after the depreciation of September and the apparent improvement in the state of French public finances. There was, in fact, some return of capital to France in October, which appears to have had a temporary effect on the balances held by the clearing banks with the Bank of England. This revival of confidence in the franc was short-lived, and did not survive the dis-closure at the end of the year that the exchange resources acquired in October had been used up. In the first quarter of 1938 there was a gradual depreciation of the franc, which became more severe during the period of political instability in March. At the beginning of May the French Government induced a depreciation of the franc to a level well below the market&apos;s immediate expectation, and announced at the same time that no further depreciation would be permitted. The level chosen was 179 francs to the pound, and the suggestion was made that the ultimate level of the franc would be 175 francs to the pound. The object of this manoeuvre was to induce a substantial return of- capital to France. In this it was successful, for there was evidence of the repatriation .of French balances amount-ing to a sum which has been estimated in the press at  100 millions, three-quarters of which is believed to have been withdrawn from London. The rates of exchange on New York and Paris are given in the.following table :

The adjustment of the flow of funds between the principal monetary-centres was effected not only by compensatory movements of gold, but also by movements of banking funds. These funds move in accordance with relative short-term interest rates in the different centres, adjusted in accordance with the profit or loss arising from the necessary hedging operations in the forward exchange market. The next table is designed to show how some of the various prices which together influence the flow of gold and banking funds have moved since the beginning of 1937. In the absence of intervention on the part of the British monetary authorities, the price of gold in London seems to be largely under the influence of the flow of funds to and from continental centres. When the flow of funds is outwards frorn/base- centres, the London price of gold has to be high enough to attract sales of gold.from these centres, and, conversely, when the flow is inwards, the London price must be low enough to attract continental purchasers. The supply and demand for gold in London is made up, in the first instance, of the newly-produced gold coming on the market, the demands for, or offers of, gold arising from continental centres, and the absorption or release of gold by private hoarders. If, after any intervention that may occur by the British authorities, the supply of-gold is in excess of- the demand for it (and this is usually the case), the surplus has to find its way to the United States, the residual market for gold. In order that this may be the case, the dollar sterling exchange must be such that the difference between the London and the New York price of gold is great enough to compensate for the costs of transhipment. As far as private &quot;operations are concerned, this-, is the case when the index in the second column of table 2 stands at 100-66* or higher. The flow of gold between Great Britain and the United States and between Great Britain and the continent arising from these causes does not always offset exactly the flow of funds arising from movements of the ordinary balance of payments, movements of capital into long-term investments, and speculative movements of short-term capital. In such cases adjustments are made by compensating movements of banking funds induced by changes in the forward rates of exchange.   The last eighteen months have seen substantial* This is the American &quot;shipping parity,&quot; and represents a difference of elevenpence between the London and New York prices of gold. When these prices^are equal, there is a premium of elevenpence in the price of gold in London over the American &quot; shipping parity.&quot;
fluctuations in these rates. In the first months of 1937 long-term capital was. flowing into the United. States in sufficient volume to finance the American purchases of gold, and any unfavourable balance of payments which there may have been. During this period the interest to be earned on British banking; funds in New York was&apos; more or less, in equilibrium with that to be earned on short-term investments at home. During the second quarter of 1937 the United States was called on to take up large quantities of dishoarded gold, and the flow of capital to New York was insufficient to finance these purchases. In the^ circumstances, a rise in the premium on the forward dollar occurred which induced a flow of banking funds from London to New York. These funds had to be kept in New York in the third quarter of the year. But in the last quarter of 1937 refugee money in New York returned to the Continent and into gold hoards in London. In the absence of gold purchases by the United States, and with the development of a favourable balance of payments in America, the premium on the forward dollar declined and British banking funds in New York returned to London. These conditions continued throughout the first two months of 1938. But with the deterioration of international conditions in March a renewed exodus of European funds to America occurred. It may be observed that on this occasion the strain on the resources of Amsterdam was met by an increase in the premium on the forward guilder, leading presumably to an increased movement of banking funds to the Netherlands. In the second quarter of 1938 the premium on the forward dollar declined further, and at the beginning of June had reached a level at which, having regard to the present low earnings on short-term funds in the United States, it may have been profitable for American banks to invest such funds in London. This development may reflect a growing adverse balance on income account on the part of the sterling well as the reflux of refugee funds to the United States.Table 2.The price of gold in London and New York, the interest to be earned on English banking funds deposited in New York and Amsterdam through forward exchange dealings, and three months&apos; Treasury Bill rate, since January 1937.Month.

3. Recorded movements of gold in international trade become less and less-isignificant. Not only has publication of these movements been suspended in France and the Netherlands, but there is a growing practice on the part of central banks of holding gold abroad. For example, the American statistics of gold movements, &amp;c., in the month of December last, indicate the acquisition Try the American Treasury, in that month of considerable stocks of gold abroad, and at the same time the earmarking of considerable quantities of gold in the United States on the part of other central banks. The published gold holdings -of the principal central banks and treasuries are shown in the following table (table 3). These figures are incomplete ,as they exclude the gold holdings of exchange accounts. The British Exchange Equalisation Account held 26 - 7 million ounces of gold on the 31st March, 1937, and 39-9 million ounces on the 30th September, 1937. It will be observed that the gold holdings of the banks and treasuries given in the table increased by *1\ million ounces in the period from the end of September till the end of May, and the combined gold holdings of the unpublished funds are unlikely to have increased by more than a moderate amount in the same period. Yet the new gold coming on the market from all sources in this period of eight months was probably between 20 and 25 million ounces. The bulk of the difference between the absorption by the five principal monetary authorities and new gold production was probably added to private hoards. There has been further hoarding of gold on private account in the month of June.Table 3.Approximate gold holdings of the five principal &quot;central banks and theU.S. Treasury.(In millions of fine ounces.)End of the month of 	Bank of England.

Treasury bill rates have kept near the conventional minimum of a half/ per cent., except during the period when money rates were under the influence of the usual stringency at the end of the half year. In December the average rate rose to -71 per cent., and the first two issues in June were at - 62 per cent.    Between the 30th September and the 31st March the total issue/
pf Treasury bills decreased frpm  899 millions to  829 millions, or by  70 millions. The tender issue declined by  61 millions, and the &quot;tap &quot; issue by  9 millions. Advances by public departments, however, increased by  5 millions. During the same period revenue exceeded expenditure (excluding sinking fund payments but including expenditure under the Defence Loans Act) by &apos; 72 millions, but the Treasury was called upon to find perhaps  9 millions in respect pf sinking fund and other capital payments. Within the same period the receiptgNsf the Unemployment Insurance Fund exceeded the fund&apos;s outgoings by  6 millions. At the end of the financial year the Unemployment Insurance Fund repaid  20 millions of its outstanding debt. It seems probable that other public departments brought enough securities to offset any sales of securities by the fund causpd by this transaction. In the first nine weeks of the current financial year public expenditure has exceeded revenue by  80 millions,  24 millions more than last year, and there has been an increase in the tender issue pf Treasury bills of  63 millions. During May the repatriation of French funds must have increased the sterling resources pf the Exchange Equalisation Account. It is possible that some part of these resources were devoted to the purchase of tender Treasury hills and that the true increase in the volume of publicly held bills has been Jess than  63 millions. During June the Treasury made an issue of  80 millions of 3 per cent, bonds maturing in the years 1954-58.. 5. The London clearing bank balances in May were under the influence of the repatriation of French funds. In each of the first four months of the year, however, the banks figures showed very similar changes in comparison with the preceding year. On the average of these months, deposits were  14 millions higher, and cash  15 millions higher. Of the other assets of the banks, money at call was  23 millions lower, discounts  9 millions lower, and investments  32 millions lower. Advances on the other hand were  67 millions higher; but they appear to be showing a declining tendency after allowing for the normal increase in the first quarter of the year. It seems, however, that the increase in the cash resources of the clearing banks, which appears to be due to the buying of securities by the Bank of England, has not provided sufficient inducement to the banks to increase their other assets. There is probably some reluctance on their part at the moment to increase their holdings of Government securities; and, at the same time, the supply of Treasury bills may not have been adequate to allow a large increase in the banks holding of them. It is possible that the loan recently issued by the Treasury, the terms of which are attractive from the point of view of the banks, may bring about an increase in their investments. At the same time the continuance of the budget deficit may prevent any contrac-tion in the Treasury bills available to them. If this is the case, the increased cash now at the disposal of the banks may lead to renewed expansion of bank deposits this summer. The effect of the repatriation of French funds in May was seen both in a decline in deposits and in a contraction in the banks cash reserves. The position reflected by the May balances was, however, of a transitional nature; for at the beginning of June these cash reserves were probably replenished by the payment of the half-yearly dividend on War Loan.

Security markets have been under the influence of the depression of trade and the anticipation of heavy Government borrowing in connection with the rearmament programme. New commercial borrowing amounted to only  20 millions in the first four months of 1938 compared with  58 millions in the same period of 1937. In addition,  10 millions was raised by the London County Council, whereas there was no borrowing by local authorities in the same months of 1937. In spite of the absence of new security offerings the price of gilt edged securities showed little improvement, except temporarily in February. The yield on 2\ per cent, consols has been as follows : Table 5.Yield on 2^ per cent, consols.Average for the year  1934 .........	co	10	Average for the year -1937-		1935 ........	2	89	June       ...	3	331936 ...	2	94	December...	co	351937 ...      .....	3	28	1938-		1936-			January   ...	co	31June	2	93	February ...	3	21December...	2	96	March     ......

Ordinary share prices have been much more seriously affected by the depression in trade and the collapse of security values in the United States. Their decline in this country has been more or less continuous since&apos; the end of 1936, and since that time their value, as shown by the index, has fallen by nearly 30 per cent. The decline in American ordinary share prices has been more severe, namely, 43 per cent,,,since March 1937, but the recession in trade and the decline in profits has been very much greater in the United States. The prices of commodities traded in speculative markets have declined by 22 per cent, since March 1937 in the United Kingdom, and by 33 per cent, in the United States. The relatively more severe decline in commodity prices in the United States is largely attributable to the foodstuffs included in the index, the prices of which are less closely linked, internationally than those of other primary commodities. The other prices in the group, however, show the same tendency, and this may have encouraged the accumulation of stocks in Great Britain rather than in the United States (quite apart from any effects of Government purchases), with the consequence a deterioration in the visible balance of trade of this country.Table 6.Prices of ordinary shares and primary commodities in Great Britain and the.

For, quite apart from the fact, that many of the prices included are less sensitive to changes in conditions of demand than those of primary commodities, they have been influenced a little by the increases of wages granted in this country and in a much larger degree in France and the United States. There has, however, been a marked decline in wholesale prices in Great Britain and in the United States, beginning in the last quarter of 1937 and continuing up to May, in which month British prices were 7 per cent.
and American nearly 11 per cent, lower than in September 1937. French prices have been affected by the continued depreciation of the franc. German prices did not rise to the same extent as world prices in 1937 and have not fallen to the same extent since September. * ,   .Table 7. 1 Wholesale commodity prices.Great Britain, (Board of Trade.&quot;)1930 ^ 100.United States.

In the following table figures are given relating to the course of employ-ment and unemployment in Great Britain since the beginning of 1936.   It should [17368] . &apos; c 2
be borne in mind that in September 1937 a1 new method of estimating the number-of unemployed was introduced which had the effect of increasing the estimate of employment by some 40,000 and of diminishing the Unemployment percentage by about three-tenths of 1 per cent.   This change has been allowed for in calcu-lating the index of employment.Table 9.Employment and unemployment among insured workers aged 16-64 (other than those insured under the agricultural scheme) in Great Britain, 1936-38.Month.

The rate of decline, however, appears to have slackened appreciably in April and May. The group of industries which first showed a declining tendency were the textile industries, together with the motor, furnishing and wireless trades. In the last few months the changes in unemployment in these industries has been little, if any, greater than might be expected for seasonal reasons at this time of year; but employment has suffered in the heavy industries (iron and steel and engineering) and in the constructional industries. The latter group of industries had satisfactory unemployment percentages in February and March; but this was probably attributable to the exceptionally favourable weather conditions in those months. The seasonal improvement in unemployment in building since March has been much smaller than is usual.9. The Board of Trade&apos;s index of industrial production for the first quarter of 1938 stood at 132-7 per cent, of the average for the&quot;year 1930. This was 2-9 per cent, less than in the fourth quarter of 1937, but 1-1 per cent, greater than in the first quarter of 1937. Certain groups covered by the index still showed a substantial expansion compared with the previous year, namely, mines and quarries (4-8 per cent, increase), iron and steel (6-7 per cent, increase), chemicals and oils (4 per cent, increase), food, drink and tobacco 4-3 per cent, increase) and gas and electricity (4-7 per cent, increase). There was, how-ever a considerable decline in the index of output of the textile industries (10 - 3 per cent, decrease) and less substantial&quot; declines in the cases of engineering and shipbuilding (2 per cent, decrease) and building materials and building (2 per cent, decrease).10.

It appears from the table that there was an improvement in the value of building plans passed for dwelling houses in the fourth quarter of 1937; it may, however, be recalled that this improvement was due to exceptionally heavy approvals in particular districts. Over the greater part of the country the fourth quarter was a relatively unsatisfactory quarter for house building. The first quarter of 1938 was again poor, but as far as house building was concerned compared fairly well with the first quarter of 1937, when new plans passed were exceptionally low owing perhaps to the increase of building costs. The decline of plans passed for other buildings has been more regular than in the case of dwelling houses, but the total still remains high, both in comparison with the period before 1935, and with the years preceding the depression of 1930.11. The domestic absorption of steel was extremely high in the months September 1937 to March 1938. This high rate was due in part to replenishment -of stocks which had become seriously depleted during the period of stringency in the first part of 1937. It was possible to rebuild stocks at this time because of the increased output of steel at home, and of the relaxation of import duties which attracted substantial supplies from abroad. By March it appears that ; stocks were beginning to reach an unwieldy level; and in April and May there was a contraction of output, and, with the reimposition of the previous rate of import duties, a very substantial falling off of imports. The demand for steel is likely to be seriously affected by a decline in building activity. There has already been a contraction of export demand, and this may continue.Table 10.Building plans approved by 146 local authorities (not including the LondonCounty Council)..(  millions.)

Retail sales have followed a normal seasonal course since about November 1937, with no apparent tendency to expand or contract. Compared with a year ago, sales in the first four months of 1938 showed an expansion in the aggregate of about 4^ per cent. But this general expansion covered a number of diverging tendencies. Food sales increased by about 7 per cent., and other sales by only 1 per cent. Though other sales have increased less than food sales throughout Great Britain, the very small increase which they have shown is really attributable to unsatisfactory sales in the London Area, especially in the central London area, where there has been a decline of 6 per cent, in other sales. The absence of an expansion of retail sales appears to be attributable to a decline in the purchasing power of the comparatively well-to-do classes.Table 12.Value of average daily retail sales in Great Britain reported to the Bank of England, as a percentage of the average for the year 1933.Month.	1932.	1933.	1934.	1935.	1936.	1937.	1938.January	104	97	101	105	116	119	127February	91	88	91	95	102	110	115March ...	97	94	99	100	108	124	120April   ...

(c) The United States.13. The present economic situation in the United States is dealt with at length, in the second part of this report. We confine ourselves at this point to the reproduction of certain of the tables which we generally include in this part of our report, reserving our comment on them. The severe decline in American industrial production began in September last, and continued throughout the fourth quarter of 1937. In the first quarter of 1938, production was steady at a level nearly one-third lower than in the first and second quarters of 1937. In April there was a further small decline. The index of employment did not fully reflect the decline in industrial activity owing to a contraction of the working week. Retail trade was fairly well maintained in the last quarter of 1937, but has been falling off during the present year.Table 13.Production, employment and retail trade in the United States since september 1935.(Indices are adjusted for seasonal variations.)						i Retail	trade.

(d) France,15. There are two aspects of the economic situation in France which give ground for concern; the first is the state of public finances and the consequent weakness of the franc, the second the depressed level of industrial production. The financial situation has been somewhat eased by the return of capital to France following on the latest depreciation of the franc. There has, however, been no improvement as yet in the industrial field. The French index of production has been declining and is substantially below the figure reached in the first part of 1937, when French industry was benefiting to some extent from the effects of the first depreciation of the franc. The number of man-hours worked in industry is also somewhat lower than a year ago, in spite of a tendency for the numbers of employed to expand, for there has been a progressive diminution in the average number of hours worked in the week, which in a number of industries is now substantially below the legal maximum of 40. It seems probable that the present organisation of French industry is such that the interruption of employment through a number of accidental causes makes it impossible for a full working week to be maintained continuously. In such conditions a legal maximum of 40 hours of work a week means a substantially smaller practical maximum. The legal 40-hour week has recently been made less rigid by a decree which permits the making good in subsequent weeks of short time in previous weeks. Indices of production, employment and aggregate man-hours worked in French industries are given in the following table : Table 15.Employment and industrial production in France since June 1936.Month.

Some improvement in French financial conditions has occurred as a result of the recent devaluation of the franc, and, given favourable political and industrial conditions, this improvement may be maintained. For the rise in French prices which has occurred since the reversal of the policy of deflation by the present chamber has produced conditions which may be compatible with a return of French capital from abroad. During the period when French currency was still maintained at its old. gold value, the French Government was spending over and above its budget receipts a greater sum than it proved possible to raise by the issue of securities. The difference was met by short-term advances from the Bank of France. But this increase in credit did not affect the price level in France because it was used to purchase gold from the Bank of France by those who wished to transfer their capital abroad. The export of capital both offset and was made possible by the excess expenditure on the part of the Government.
The depreciation of the franc, and the rise in wages induced largely by political action in the last two years, have brought about a great rise in prices, which are now 75 per cent, higher than two years ago. In the same period the French note issue has risen only by 17-J per cent, and commercial bank deposits have risen hardly at all. At their present level the cash resources of the French people are low in relation to the turnover which they have to support. Given a return of confidence in the currency, it is probable that a very substantial increase in these resources would be required by the French public. This has an important bearing on the return of French capital from abroad. If capital were to return at a time when the demand for money was fully met by the existing note circulation, prudence would require that any returning funds which found their way into the market for government securities should be used to repay government advances to the Bank of France; for otherwise the net effect of the return would be to compel the Bank of France to increase its note issue in order to finance its increased gold holding, and the attempt to issue notes in excess of the public demand might well create conditions in which the return flow of capital was reversed. But if there is a demand for increased currency at the time when capital is returning from abroad into the market for Government securities, it is possible for the Government to use these funds to meet its current expenses without creating financial conditions likely to bring the return flow of capital to an end; for the use of this old capital to meet current expenditure would be balanced by the absorption of current savings in the form of notes. The reduction which has taken place in the real value of French monetary resources through the rise in prices and incomes may be a necessary condition for the successful repatriation of French capital from abroad.(e) Germany.17. Production and employment in Germany show no sign yet of suffering from the depression of trade which is affecting the rest of the world. Unemploy-ment increased as usual in the winter, but it has since returned to its previous low level, at which it is clear that there is virtually no surplus of unemployed labour in Germany. Employment has increased by 1,800,000 since the month of January, and by 700,000 since August, the month of highest employment last year. This increase has been made possible by the increase of the insured population. During the second half of 1937 there was a marked improvement in the production of consumption goods which was partly of a seasonal nature, and since the new year there has been a small decline in output, which was paralleled in the spring of 1937, but not in that of 1936. The output of investment goods is normally affected in the winter months by the decline in building activity. There was as usual a recovery this spring, and in April the index of production had reached a higher level than at any time last year.18. The most important financial development in Germany has been the decision of the Government to finance its budget deficit in future entirely by the issue of long- and medium-term securities. This decision has been taken because on the one hand the liquid resources of financial and industrial institutions are already very high, and because, partly as a consequence of this, the demand for longer dated securities has become very brisk. The four-year plan, which will absorb much capital, is to be financed by the industries concerned, partly by the sale of their present liquid assets, partly by bank advances, and partly by the issue of securities. The public demands on the productive capacity of constructional industries in Germany will continue to require some limitation on private construction in the current year.19. German foreign trade during the current year has shown an unfavour-able balance, which is probably a reflection of the difficulty of selling goods abroad as a result of worsened trading conditions. The German absorption of Austria may also have repercussions on the German balance of payments. The policy envisaged for Austria includes a large expansion of public works and an increase in the standard of living. This will have the effect of producing a less favourable balance of payments. At the same time, the balance of payments would be relieved if the payments on the Austrian external debt were discontinued. The Austrian reserves of foreign currency might in any event be utilised to finance an adverse balance of payments for a time.[173681 D

(f) International trade.20. The volume of world trade in 1937 was 3^ per cent, lower than in 1929, according to preliminary estimates prepared by the League of Nations. Having regard to seasonal factors, the second and the third quarters of the year were the most satisfactory. In the fourth quarter of the year there was a fairly sharp drop in world trade, and there was a further decline in the first quarter of 1938. The gold value figure for April 1938 is again lower than in March, and substantially lower than in April 1937.Table 17.International Trade.

British exports in the first five months of 1938 were  196-3 millions, which was  20-6 millions or 9-9 per cent, lower than in 1937. He-exports were  27 - 9 millions,  5 - 5 millions lower than 1937, whereas imports at  393 - 4 millions were only  1 - 8 millions lower than in 1937. The visible adverse balance of trade in the first five months of 1938 was thus  169-2 millions compared with  155-0 millions in 1937, an increase of  14-2 millions. This increase in the adverse balance was attributable to the high level of British imports in the first quarter of the year, which were actually  15-3 millions higher than in 1937. In the last two months the adverse balance has been smaller than in 1937 by  4-3 millions. Nevertheless, having regard to the delayed effect of the inter-national recession on the export of heavy engineering products, it is probable that the adverse balance of British trade for the year as a whole will be at least as great this year as in 1937. The year 1937 ended with an adverse balance of payments estimated by the Board of Trade at  52 millions, or  42 millions if changes in the stocks of silver held in this country are disregarded. British receipts last year benefited by a substantial increase in shipping income, from  85 millions in 1936 to  130 millions in 1937. In view of the fall in freight rates and the reduction in the volume of international trade this year, it cannot be anticipated that much of this increase will be held this year. There may also be a reduction in investment income attributable to the decline in commodity prices. Having regard to all these factors, we must anticipate a substantial increase in this country&apos;s adverse balance- of payments this year, unless there is an unexpectedly strong improvement in international trading conditions, which could only occur in the event of a revival of activity in the United States.[17368] d 2   ,

The countries responsible for the principal increases and decreases in British exports in the first quarter of 1938 are shown in the following table. It would appear from this that British trade was suffering from the depression in America, from the depreciation of the gold bloc currencies, from the war in the Far East, and from the collapse of purchasing power in West Africa. Trade with most empire countries continued to expand, and.there was an improvement in a number of European markets. In assessing future prospects, however, account must be taken of the fact that the import trade of a number of British countries, and also of certain Scandinavian countries, has been supported so far this year by drawing on balances accumulated in London during earlier years. As these balances are diminished imports are likely to be curtailed, and British export trade will suffer.Table 19.Countries to which exports of United Kingdom goods in the quarter ending March 31 showed changes in excess of  200,000 between 1937 and 1938.

Part 2. The economic situation in the United States.24. In our last report we took the view that the immediate course of business activity in this country was likely to be greatly influenced by events in the United States, both because of the sympathetic connection between British and American security markets and because of the repercussions on British overseas trade of a contraction of purchasing power in the United States. We were of the opinion, moreover, that the late spring was likely to present the first opportunity for a reversal of the downward trend of American business, because the reduction of stocks of goods which was then taking place was hardly likely to be completed before that time. This first critical point has been passed without any signs of a business revival in the United States, and British trade is already suffering from the contraction of purchasing power abroad. In these circumstances the economic outlook in the United States continues to be of the greatest significance, and we revert to its consideration in the following report.(a) Capital development in the United States.25. The present depression in the United States may be approached from either of two angles. On the one hand, there is the series of events which led up to the present depression, and provided the occasion for the decline in activity. On the other hand, there is the fundamental weakness of the American economy which made it incapable of withstanding adverse influences which might have had only a small effect upon a more robustly situated system. This weakness lies, most probably, in the meagre flow of capital into private industry and building.26. In the depression of 1930-34 investment suffered a severe reaction from the heavy programmes carried out in the preceding boom, and in the early stages of recovery there was no sign of a demand for capital from industry or to finance private building. It was in these circumstances that the federal government entered upon the policy of deficit finance, with, among other objects, that of providing an outlet for the increased savings of the population which might be * expected to accompany increased prosperity. The securities issued to meet this deficit were naturally of a kind to appeal to. institutional investors, such as insurance companies and banks, and to investors of small means. This suited the needs of the moment, which were to increase the liquid resources of the community and to utilise the current savings of the middle classes. Both the demand for, and the supply of savings in this period, were of a kind in which the factor of risk bearing played a very small part.27. It was the intention of the administration that the policy of deficit financing should be brought to a close as soon as the demand for capital on the part of industry revived. It should have been clear at the time that qualitatively this demand would be different from that created by the government deficit. For capital invested in industry and the like is obviously exposed to a much higher degree of risk than that invested in government securities. But the federal authorities, if they were concerned with this question at all, no doubt calculated that an increase in liquid capital, such as their policy was designed to provide, would unloose once more the speculative spirit so prevalent in the preceding boom.28. Indeed, their preoccupation seems to have been more with the contrary danger, that speculative sentiment, jvhen it revived, would be so difficult to control that a second Wall Street boom would occur, with all the abuses which experience led them to connect with it. This fear, allied with a predisposition in favour of a more even distribution of wealth, led them to embark upon a revision of the system of taxation which has apparently had the effect of curtailing the supply of new capital which is invested in securities bearing the full risks of enterprise.
Moreover, the actions and words of the Administration^ leaders, both by the hostility to the present organisation of business which they showed at times and by their apparent uncertainty of purpose, have seemed to increase these risks.29. The changes in the taxation system referred to above were three in number. First, the rates of taxation on the higher ranges of income were increased and made more sharply progressive. This change in itself would have had some effect on the willingness of American capitalists to take risks; but its effect was aggravated by the existence in America of a large fund of tax-exempt securities, issued largely by state governments, though in the past the federal government has also issued tax-exempt securities. An investor in these securities avoids all income and surtax payments on the income derived from them, and there has been a strong inducement to those who pay a high rate of tax to invest a large proportion of their capital in this form. This has with-drawn capital from more speculative forms of investment. More important, however, in drying up the supplies of risk-bearing capital have been the capital gains tax and the undistributed profits tax.30. A capital gains tax, or a tax on those increments of the wealth of individuals which arise, not through interest or dividend payments, but through the realised appreciation of assets (whether securities, real property, or com-modities), was a feature of the American system in the period 1924-31. From 1931 to 1934 there were few, if any, capital gains, and the principle of the tax was modified to protect the revenue against the effects of capital losses. In the years 1934-36 the tax was entirely recast. The effect of a capital gains tax on the willingness of capitalists to take speculative risks depends very largely on the provisions made with regard to the treatment of capital losses. If losses are treated as a deduction from ordinary income to just the same extent as gains are treated as an addition to ordinary income, the effect is to make the Treasury an involuntary partner in the risk undertaken by the taxpayer; and, within limits set by the degree of progressiveness in rates of taxation, the taxpayer can avoid the tax by increasing the capital which he exposes to risk. If, however, losses may not be deducted from ordinary income, but only from other capital gains, the effect is to reduce very materially the inducement to undertake risks. The system of taxation in force up to 1931 followed the first principle; that in force since 1934 has followed the second, subject to the proviso that losses may be set off against ordinary income up to a maximum of 2,000 dollars a year. In sum, American taxation policy with regard to capital gains has passed through three stages since 1924: in the first, 1924-31, it favoured the undertaking of risks; in the period 1931-34, the question was dormant; in the last period, since 1934, it has actively discouraged speculative investment by those who pay a high rate of ordinary taxation.31. A rather similar evolution occurred in respect of the treatment of undis-tributed profits. Profits retained within businesses have in the past provided an important part of the new risk-bearing capital required by American industry. Under the American system dividends paid out by businesses were always subject to a corporation tax, and were further subject to individual income tax, payable by the recipient (if not a corporation), which is low in the small income ranges, but is steeply graduated in the higher income ranges. Before the introduction of the undistributed profits tax, income retained by the corporation for its own use escaped not only the individual income tax, but also the corporation profits tax, and it was quite customary for progressive businesses to retain a large proportion of their earnings in the business and to recompense their proprietors by periodic stock bonuses, which escaped taxation. The effect of the undistributed profits tax introduced in 1936 was not only to make all the profits of a business subject to corporation profits tax, whether paid out in dividends or retained within the business, but also to make the rate of tax payable dependent on the proportion of total profits paid out in dividends: the higher that proportion, the lower was the rate of tax. The new system discriminated against the financing of business out of its own reserves just as much as the old system had discriminated in favour of it. The consequence was that a given rate of business expansion gave rise to a much greater demand for risk-bearing capital from the investment market than was previously the case.
32. Before the slump of 1930, the American economy had been adjusted to a very high rate of technical improvement, the consequences of which were, on the one hand, the concentration of a very high proportion of its productive capacity in the industries producing plant and equipment, and, on the other hand, a free and abundant supply of risk-bearing capital, provided both by industry itself and by the investment market. During the period of depression this process of technical improvement was brought to a standstill by the decline in the profit-earning capacity of industry and by the failure of the demand for the final products of industry to show its customary expansion. Not only was there no new investment in industry, but a large part of the renewal funds, fed by current depreciation charges, remained unspent. In the circumstances the durable goods industries experienced a much greater degree of depression than did industries producing non-durable consumption goods. Nevertheless, in spite of some contraction, the durable goods industries emerged from the depression with a capacity for production which could only be justified by a resumption of the process of technical improvement. In the first period of recovery there were indications that this process would, indeed, be resumed. The unspent renewal funds, for all that they had been eaten into by the losses suffered in the depression, provided a source from which expenditure on equipment could be met, and, as profits began to be earned again, current depreciation charges were capable of financing considerably enlarged purchases of equipment. But industrial demand for capital goods never developed to a point at which production regained its 1929 level, in spite of increased demand on the part of the government for such goods, nor was there any satisfactory expansion of the demand for new capital on the part of industry.* This failure of demand to materialise is not attributed in the United States to the absence of potential borrowers, but to the unsatisfactory state of the security markets. There is, moreover, supporting evidence that this is the case in the rapidly increasing demand for bank loans, on the part of industry in the same period. The unsatisfactory condition of the capital market is in turn blamed on the changes in taxation introduced by the present Administration, as well as on the difficulties of making new issues on the conditions required by the Securities Act. Having regard to the inflow of foreign funds into the American security markets, which continued through 1937, it is at any rate clear that little, if any, of the new savings of the American public in this period were finding their way into industrial securities.33. It is probable that the interference which may have occurred with the free flow of capital into industry in the United States was occasioned by the qualitative unsuitability of the supplies of new savings coming forward for investment in industry. For that is a danger to which modern states are exposed because a greatly increased proportion of the savings of every industrial community to-day is of an institutional character, being undertaken through the channels provided by insurance companies, building societies, savings banks and the like. Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that throughout the period 1934-36 the government was making very heavy demands on the capital market to finance the budget deficits, with the result that the market was oversaturated with government bonds at the end of this period. When therefore the demands on the bond market to finance the deficit ceased, with the balancing of the budget at the beginning of 1937, the rate of interest on commercial bonds did not fall to a level at which new borrowing on commercial account was encouraged; for the market was depressed by sales of securities on the part of the banks. There was, at any rate, a rise in the yield on commercial bonds in the first half of 1937&apos; naturally more marked in the case of second-grade bonds, which was no doubt attributable, in the first instance, to the more restrictive monetary policy pursued by the Federal Reserve authorities, but which would probably not have occurred* New issues in the United States on behalf of corporate borrowers (excluding issues for refunding purposes) were as follows from 1928 to 1937 (in millions of dollars):  	1928.	1929.	1930.	1931.	1932.	1933.	1934.	1935.	1936.	1937.Total	...  5,346	8,002	4,483	1,551	325	161	178	404	1,192	1,192Bonds	... 2,385	2,078	2,980	1,239	305	40	144	334	839	789Stocks	...  2,961	5,924	1,503	311	20	120	35	69	352	403
in the same degree if the banking system had been more willing holders of the bonds bought in the years 1934-36.*34. Whatever the causes, it is clear that the renewal of investment activity was not great enough to give American recovery sufficient momentum to carry it over the difficult period which began, for causes which we discuss fully below, in the autumn of 1937. t To anticipate the results of this discussion, the equilibrium in the demand for and supply of capital was disturbed in the period extending from the last quarter of 1936 to the first quarter of 1937, first by a heavy accumulation of working capital, and then by the dispersal of this accumulation. Had the demand for investment goods been broader, these changes might quite possibly have been offset, first by a damping-down of constructional activity while industry was demanding funds to finance an accumulation of stocks, and subsequently when this restrictive influence was removed by a resump-tion of projects held up during the period of stringency. What in fact happened was that the Government took advantage of the period of expanding commercial demand for loans to reduce its loan financed expenditure, but did not resume this expenditure when commercial loans began to be repaid. It was the failure of the demand for capital for investment purposes to revive at the close of the period of comparative monetary stringency in the first half of 1937 which converted what should have been only a temporary recession into a much more formidable depression of trade.(b) The immediate causes of the recession in the United States.35. The chain of events which culminated in the present setback in trade in the United States can probably be traced back to the payment of the Veterans&apos; Bonus at the end of June 1936. This payment amounted to 1,673 million dollars, of which about 1,200 million dollars was withdrawn by the recipients in the form of cash. Part of this vast sum was spent immediately, and retail trade received a substantial stimulus in the second and third quarters of 1936. But the greater part of the bonus was destined to find its way to the motor industry, and actual expenditure was deferred until the last quarter of the year 1936, after the appearance of the year&apos;s new models at the New York Motor Show.

The first is an estimate of the man hours worked in durable goods industries based on series published by the Department of Labour.

effect in that quarter and the succeeding quarter was remarkable..-* This buying of motor cars seems to have diverted purchasing power from,more general trade not only when is was at its height, but also throughout the period when instalment payments on motor cars bought previously were being completed. Ordinary retail trade was relatively less resilient than might have been expected ill the first three quarters of 1937. Towards the end of 1937 the payment of instalments on cars bought at the end of 1936 were completed and the general retail sales of goods benefited from the discontinuance of this drain.&apos; But by that time trade was falling off, and the fillip which expenditure received from this cause was not sufficient to arrest the decline.36. This analysis of the effect of the Veterans&apos; Bonus payment on retail sales is based upon an examination of the relative fluctuations of the indices of retail expenditure, on general goods and on motor cars, on the one hand, and of the income accruing to individuals on the other. These indices are, of course, by no means exact and inferences based on them must necessarily be speculative. But the course of retail demand in the United States has clearly been subject to exceptional influences in the last two years which have caused it to diverge from the path which it might have been expected to follow on the basis of the develop-ment of the national income in the period under review as far as it, can be ascertained. These divergencies can be explained by reference to the oscillations[Continued from p. 25.]Value of construction contracts awarded in thirty-seven Eastern States of the?

We-reproduce in the footnote below a table which we have prepared showing the ratio which retail sales have borne to the income accruing to individuals since the beginning of 1932*37. We turn next to the effect of these fluctuations in demand on the policy of business men. We confine ourselves to the industries producing goods for current consumption. As we have seen, the first effect of the Veterans&apos; Bonus payment was to produce a spurt in the retail demand for goods other than motor cars, and it seems that orders for new goods were placed by dealers with manu-f acturers on the assumption that demand would continue at the enhanced level of* The following table gives the three months&apos; moving average of the ratio of retail sales to individual income in the period from the beginning of 1932. No particular significance attaches to the ratio represented by the figure 100. Indices of income and of sales have both been reduced to-the base 1932-36 ^ 100, and where the ratio in the table equals 100 this merely means that the ratio of expenditure to income is the same as over the average of this period. The index of income is that recently published by the Department of Commerce under the heading of &quot; National Income paid out &quot;; it excludes income accruing to corporations and not paid out in the form of dividends, &amp;c. Furthermore, it excludes the income accruing to individuals through bonus payments and through direct relief payments, on the part of the Government; it includes, however, work relief payments. This fact affects the comparability of the ratios in different years. In the years 1934 and 1935 a large part of the Government deficit was incurred through direct relief payments, and this tends to increase the ratio of sales to income in this period. Since the beginning of 1936 direct relief payments have practically ceased. The indices of sales used is in the case of general goods an average of the three principal indices, namely, Department store sales, Chain store sales, and sales of rural general merchandise. The index of motor sales is that given above. The combined ratio is an average of the two ratios of retail sales and motor sales weighted in the proportion of 6:1. All the indices used are adjusted for seasonal variations, and this may affect the reliability of the table.&apos; Variation in indices of retail expenditure (a) on general goods, (b) on motor cars, and (c) on (a) and (b) combined, in comparison with the index of incomes received.(Index of income -. 100.)Three months&apos; moving averages.
the last quarter of 1936. In any event the output of consumers&apos; goods in the first four or five months, of 1937 was as high as in the last quarter of 1936. Retail demand, however, fell off for the reasons which we have examined. The con-sequence was that stocks of consumers&apos; goods showed a rapid accumulation in this period. In ordinary circumstances this accumulation of stocks would have led to an early recession of trade; but in the circumstances of the time traders were willing to carry these increased stocks for some months, partly because the general upward tendency of prices was favourable to the holding of stocks and partly because the upward tendency of wage rates gave reason for supposing that stocks could only be replaced at a higher cost in the future. In. September, concurrently with the break in the stock market, business sentiment turned round and a phase of stock reduction occurred, which, together with the saturation of the demand for motor cars, was the immediate cause of the decline in industrial activity. In the last quarter of 1937 and in the first quarter of 1938 the level of output of consumers&apos; goods was well below that which was required to meet current cOn-sumption. It may be pointed out that consumption was extraordinarily well maintained: at&apos;any rate in the last quarter of 1937. and that this may be attributable, as was suggested above, to the completion of the instalment payments on goods bought with the aid of the Veterans&apos; Bonus.*38. Another respect in which the events described above require to be considered is from the point of view of their effect on the demand for and supply of capital. We have already remarked that the year 1937 saw a remarkable change in the. demands of the government on the capital market. The true deficit of the United States government is hard to calculate; but, excluding the effect of payments to, and receipts from, revolving funds and payments to trust accounts (including the Veterans&apos; Bonus), it appears that this deficit was comparatively low in the first quarter of 1936, high in the last three quarters of 1936, low again in* We may reproduce here a calculation of the variation in the volume of output and sales of non-durable consumers&apos; goods similar to that which we gave in our last report. The index of output is based partly on the statistics of the Department of Labour relative to hours worked in non-durable goods industries, and partly on the Federal Eeserve Board&apos;s index of production. The index of sales is based on the three series mentioned in the footnote to paragraph 36 above, divided by an index of retail prices.Volume of output and sales in non-durable goods industries. 1932-36 - 100.

the first two quarters of 1937, and even lower in the last two quarters of 1937 and the first quarter of 1938. The variations in the Government demand on the capital market in the year 1937 and the first quarter of 1938 may very likely have been offset by changes in the demand for capital arising from fluctuations in the balance of payments. Taking all these factors into account the demand for Capital in the United States which did not arise from the needs of industry and of private investment was probably fairly constant, and substantially lower than in the previous year. At the same time the potentialities of saving were possibly greater than in the previous year, for the national income was at a higher level.39. Demand, however, was supported in the first three quarters of 1937 by an increased need for capital on the part of industry. This demand was not satisfied to a greater extent than in 1936 by issues of industrial securities. It did, however, give rise to a strong demand for bank loans on the part of industry. It is probable that a not inconsiderable part of this increased demand for bank loans was required to meet expenditure on plant and equipment, which, had the market been more favourable, would have been met by the issue of securities. In addition, during the first four or five months of 19.37, the increase in the physical volume of stocks, referred to previously, led to increased bank loans. The physical volume of stocks, in the non-durable goods industries at any rate, ceased to expand in the early months of last summer, whereas the industrial and commercial demand for bank credit continued to grow until the middle of October. Apart from the demand for loans to finance purchases of plant and equipment, reasons for this may be found in increasing stocks of raw materials, in the higher costs of stock and work in process, which were a consequence of the increase in wages in the spring and summer, and in the increase in book debts, also attributable to higher prices. For the most part borrowing for these purposes tended to maintain incomes and consumers&apos; expenditure, and it may be the case that the increase in wages and prices tended for a time to transfer to industry the function, previously performed by the Federal Government, of borrowing to support consumption. If this is the case it would explain why the cessation of stock accumulation in the early summer of last year did not lead to an immediate reaction of trade. At the same time the effect of this increased borrowing by industry at a time when, for the reasons given earlier, the market for industrial securities was not in a position to absorb new issues on the necessary scale, was to increase short-term indebtedness to a level which business men themselves may have considered undesirable.40. The unfavourable situation of industry was, moreover, aggravated by the repercussions on industrial profits of the very substantial increases in wages granted earlier in the year. These increases had been granted at a time when a further rise in prices was generally anticipated, and when, in consequence, business men expected to be able to pass on their burden to the consumer. This, in fact, proved impossible, and industrial profits suffered. The falling off of industrial profits in turn reacted upon the price of industrial securities, and was one of the principal causes of the break on Wall Street in the early autumn of last year. In the circumstances of the time the weak condition of the stock markets, quite apart from any reactions it may have had upon consumers&apos; expenditure, had the important consequence of making it impossible for business men to reduce their short-term indebtedness by the issue of securities. Given the fact that the deterioration of business liquidity had reached a point at which business men wished to take some remedial action, there was no resource open to them but to reduce their current purchases, and this they proceeded to do.41. The part which purely financial causes played in the chain of events, which we have outlined above, is hard to estimate. They may have tended to prevent the readjustment of the American economy to the curtailment of Govern-ment loan financed expenditure, in the first part of the year 1937, and they may, with less certainty, be blamed for aggravating the decline which set in in the autumn. In the last half of 1936, prices began to rise sharply, possibly as a consequence of the Veterans&apos; Bonus payment; and this led the Federal Reserve authorities to take remedial action, partly by preventing a further increase in member bank reserves through the gold sterilisation policy, and partly by immobilising the greater part of the existing excess reserves of member banks by an increase in reserve requirements. The consequence of these actions was seen in the attitude of the member banks to the holding of investments. Purchases [17368] f 2
of investments by member banks ceased in the middle of 1936, and from that time on the increase in member bank deposits, which continued till the end of the -year, was entirely due to the increase in bank advances. With the tightening of reserve requirements which actually came into effect in March and May of 1937 but which was announced at the end of January, the increase in bank advances was more than offset by sales of investments by the banks, which continued till October 1937. The consequence was that the increase in bank deposits was first checked, and then, as the growth of advances began to slow down, reversed. From October onwards bank advances were being repaid, as the accumulations of stocks held by industrial and commercial firms were dispersed, and as loans incurred to finance the purchase of securities were being paid off. But during this period the banks have only resumed the purchases of securities in a very half-hearted manner, and the decline of bank deposits has continued.42. Throughout this period banking policy has probably had little if any effect on the volume of advances. The increase of advances occurred in response to a change in the conditions of demand, and there is no evidence that it was checked by any action of the banks. The subsequent decline in advances has also occurred at the initiative of the borrowers. Banking policy, if it has affected the course of events, has worked through its influence on security prices. In this respect, its influence was most noticeable in the first quarter of 1937, when sales of securities by the banks were responsible for a weakening of the bond market. This weakening, coinciding, as it did with a rapid rise in building costs, no doubt played a part in cutting short the incipient revival of constructional activity, which began in the latter part of 1936.43. It is possible, moreover, though this is more speculative, that monetary developments are playing some part to-day in delaying a revival of economic activity. The sales of securities undertaken in the first part of 1937 had no effect on the volume of bank deposits in existence, because there was at the time a strong demand for bank advances, to finance industrial requirements and the speculative purchase of securities. Now that these loans are being repaid, the sales of investments are having a deferred effect on &quot;the volume of deposits; for the purchases of securities on the part of the banks since October have been small in relation to the repayment of loans. In any event, in the late spring, the &quot; adjusted demand deposits &quot; of reporting member banks were some 7 per cent, smaller than they were a year earlier, and the demand and time deposits of these banks together were about 6 per cent, lower than a year earlier. This curtail-ment of deposits occurred at a time when business prospects had undergone a sudden and severe change for the worse, and when the value of invested capital was tending to fall in any event. To arrest this decline a substantial increase in the liquid assets in the hands of the investing public would have been necessary. Instead, there was a contraction in these assets.44. The picture which we have drawn of economic events in the United States in the last two years has as its central feature the disturbance of equilibrium by the disbursal of a large sum in one single payment in a country which lacked the stability provided by a steady flow of capital into industrial uses. There followed, as a consequence of this act, a period in which consumers&apos; demand suffered violent distortion, and this again was succeeded by a period in which the government and the monetary authorities together exerted all their influence to avoid the inflationary consequences of this act. For some while the two sets of forces preserved an unstable equilibrium; but when the corrective deflationary action began to get the upper hand it became plain that, as a consequence of the events of the preceding twelve months, the economic system had acquired a considerable momentum in the other direction. . Recognition of this fact was slow in coming, and there was no quick reversal of policy. In the first instance the forces making for a contraction of trade arose from the attempts of industrialists to disperse the accumulations of stocks which they had built up. It seems probable, however, that by the end of the first quarter of this year these -attempts had largely been successful; but, nevertheless, there has been no revival of trade. The absence of a revival may perjiaps be blamed on the repercussions on the willingness of consumers to incur expenditure of a collapse in capital values, set in motion by the decline in trade activity and possibly accentuated by continued monetary contraction.   There is some evidence of this in the table
which we have given in a footnote to paragraph 13 above, from which it appears that consumers are already tending to spend a smaller proportion of their incomes. This table, moreover, provides a warning, from the experience of 1932, of the lengths to which this contraction of expenditure may go in the event of a real collapse in capital values.(c) Remedial Measures undertaken by the United States Government.45. Recently, however, belated steps of a constructive nature have been taken by the government to counteract the process of deflation and it remains to consider how soon, if at all, these steps will succeed in checking it. These measures are some of them directed towards securing a renewed flow of capital into industry, and some of them towards the immediate relief of the business situation. In the first category may be placed the Tax Revision Act, which has been passed by Congress against the wishes of the President. This Act does not restore the position existing before the Act which it supersedes, but it makes a number of concessions, in respect of the capital gains tax and in the undistributed profits tax favourable to the investment of funds in industry. The two most substantial -changes in the capital gains tax are first that the taxpayer is given the alternative of paying a tax of 30 per cent, of capital gains assessed to tax (the amount of which in the present law as in its predecessor varies in accordance with the length of time the asset has been held) in the place of adding the capital gains to his normal income; and secondly it allows &quot;long-term losses (i.e., losses on assets held over eighteen months) to be offset against normah income, and short-term losses to be set off against short-term gains in the next succeeding year. On the other hand, the proportion of long-term gains assessable to tax are altered to the disadvantage of the taxpayer. The undistributed profits tax is altered so that the corporation tax payable on profits retained amounts to 19 per cent., and on profits paid out to 16-g per cent, irrespective of the proportion of profits retained. This represents a more considerable surrender of the principle of the previous Act, than the alteration in. the capital gains tax. In spite of these concessions it would seem that the present system of taxation is less favourable to enterprise than that existing in the period 1924-31, and also less favourable than the British system, which disregards capital gains and losses (except in the case of professional speculators).46. A second feature of the Administration^ recovery programme is the new housing act, to which we referred in our last report. The principle of this act is to increase the proportion of money which federally insured mortgage associa-tions may advance on house property from 80 to 90 per cent, of the valuation of the property, and to extend the benefits of federal insurance to new classes of property. The effect of the act is therefore to halve the capital required to be found by builders. There appears to be an undoubted shortage of certain classes of houses in the United States, and a reasonably conservative estimate - of building requirements has put the annual total for the next two years at approximately 500,000 houses compared with a production of approximately 300,000 houses in 1937 and from 600,000 to 900,000 in the building boom of the twenties. Difficulty, however, arises from the fact that the shortage of houses is practically confined to the low rental groups, which it is impossible to build without loss so long as building costs remain at their present level. The demand for new houses is therefore confined to the middle classes, and is only affected by the potential need for houses among the working classes in so far as this secures a steady market for &quot; second hand &quot; houses. A consequence of this situation is that building tends to be very much restricted when the position of the middle classes is impaired, as it is to-day by a collapse of security prices, and business earnings. Although the new housing act may provide valuable support to the building industry at the present time there is already some evidence that it has and may become of con-,siderable importance when business revives, we doubt whether it will prove the stimulus needed to initiate a business revival. If, however, the act should succeed in its purpose when trade revives, and there should then be a substantial resumption of residential building, this should reduce considerably the dependence of American business activity on government support.47.   The most important element in the government plans, however, is the new &quot;spending and lending&quot; programme.   This programme includes three
points: (a) the federal government will increase its expenditure on relief and recovery projects, with the result that the budget deficit will, if the programme is carried out to the letter, be increased to a level comparable with the highest reached in the last depression; (&amp;) the Reconstruction Finance Corporation has been authorised to make loans to private business up to a total of 1,500 million dollars, this sum being included in the estimated budget deficit; (c) the basis of credit has been extended (i) by reducing the reserves required to be held by member banks with the Federal Reserve Banks by 12^ per cent., and (ii) by abolishing the Inactive Gold Funds and transferring gold from the Stabilisation Fund so that, in all, the Treasury&apos;s working balance with the Federal Reserve Banks may be increased by 1,400 million dollars by the issue of gold certificates to the Reserve Banks for this amount,. The increase in the- Tf easury&apos;s balance at the Reserve Banks will gradually be transferred to meniber banks by drawing upon this balance to repay Treasury bills as they mature,48. It is probable that the financial side of this programme will have only a small influence on the course of events. It will maintain short-term money rates at a low level; but there is no reason to suppose that these rates, which are in any event extremely low, have had, or are likely to have, any influence whatever on the business situation. Moreover, the substitution of cash for Treasury bills in the assets of the banks is not likely to have much effect in present circumstances. The importance of the programme lies in the direct effect which Government spending is likely to have on the business situation, and this calls for some examination both of the extent of the increased spending programme which is in contemplate-tion and the time at which it will begin to be effective.49. It seems to be generally agreed that the Presidents announcement greatly exaggerated the increase in actual expenditure which might reasonably be expected from the new programme. A large part of the impressive total was made up of allocations to spending authorities (e.g., the United States Housing Authority), which already had larger funds than they were capable of using. A careful examination of the effect of the new programme on the government deficit made by a reliable American authority has put the most probable deficit (excluding debt retirement) for the year ending the 30th June, 1939, at 3,000 million dollars compared with a probable deficit of 1,350 million dollars in the year 1937-38, and deficits of 2,707 million dollars and 4,361 million dollars, including the Veterans&apos; Bonus in the years 1936-37 and- 1935-36 respectively. That is to say, the programme contemplates a return to the level of loan financed expenditure reached before the recent attempt of the United States Treasury to return to a more orthodox budget policy. More important, however, than the size of the increased spending programme is the speed with which it can be got under way, and produce a reversal of the present deflationary tendencies. In this connection it is necessary to bear in mind that the proposals for expenditure do-not represent concrete projects which might be put in hand, with no more than the delays inseparable from tendering and the like. All that has happened so far is that the Administration has expressed its willingness to spend money up to the limits named, provided that the necessary opportunities are discovered. We must therefore anticipate a considerable interval before any substantial increase in government expenditure begins. We may conclude therefore that the govern-ment spending programme will not be exerting any substantial influence on the business situation before the latter- part of the year, and that even then its influence will be moderate.50. The review which we have given of the measures to be taken by the United States government does not lead us to anticipate that they will produce a quick improvement in the business situation. Hopes of an early improvement must rest, as before, On the possibility that, in place of the curtailment of stocks which has been proceeding in recent months in America, a revival of business confidence should produce a tendency to increase stocks. Of this at present we see little hope, and our conclusion must be that American recovery is likely to be deferred till the latter part of the year.2 Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1, June 27, 1938.
-  ANNEX.Note by the Chairman on his recent visit to the United States.When this report had reached its final form in draft, I made a short visit to New York and Baltimore, and met a number of representative economists, business men and bankers, through whom I was able to test its argument and conclusions. Broadly, I found there was no particular reason to modify it in any way. The effect of the veterans&apos; bonus expenditure is often referred to in a general way, but apparently no study has been made of it along the lines of paragraphs 12 to 14. The point about the &apos;&apos; qualitative&apos;&apos; change in the expectation of new money coming &quot;forward in future (paragraphs 4, &amp;c.) has not been appreciated. The 1920-30 capital issues were 91 per cent, corporate and 9 per cent, government. The 1931-37 percentages were 15-4 and 84-6 respectively, and one commentator says : &quot; The whole vast story of the reasons for the current depression is found in these figures.&quot; He puts the causes of the depression in this order : (1) Over stimulation of production and excessive inventories, (2) change in credit policy, (3) curtailment of Government expenditure when business &apos;&apos; was not able&apos;&apos; to take up the slack, (4) Govern-ment competition with public utilities, (5) political developments undermining husiness confidence. It is much more generally acknowledged now, than say three or four months ago, that the Federal Reserve action in changing the excess reserve ratios in 1937 was actually deflationary in its effect upon business psychology.   (Paragraphs 18 and 19.)A distinction is drawn between the nature of this recent business recovery and all previous ones. Formerly recovery was carried forward on a wave of new investment which wa,s not narrowly based on current consumption prospects; bold forward projects based on important technological advances, reduced costs, &amp;p., were projected in the faith that the forward march in capital accumulation a*y production equipment would itself call forth an enlarged purchasing power. Professor Hansen (Harvard) says investment typically led and not followed consumption. This recovery was different; it has been peculiarly based on a rise in consumption (with business men avoiding long-term capital commitments). Such a recovery &quot; can go forward only so long as the consumption stimulus is applied. Worse yet, it cannot even maintain the level reached once the new funds are no longer poured into consumer markets.&quot; The statement is now commonly made that Government expenditure may prime the pump, but not the right pump.It is generally acknowledged that many &quot;physical&quot; factors are now improved ready for recovery, e.g., altered taxation, adjusted stocks, rising credit facilities. But nothing is of any avail to give business confidence to go forward until the political outlook changes. If the President speaks ill for business  had; if he speaks well no better, for he cannot be trusted, is &quot; double crossing,&quot; -&amp;c. The distrust of any business recovery under this administration is almost unbelievable. But even the adjournment of Congress has a psychological value, as a relief from new threats. In the view of several competent observers, the first releasing force would be elections running against the Government, when ousiness would jump in rapidly to get the first advantages of the upward move-ment. In any case, commodities will respond to the monetary influence at work during the Autumn, and there is a good chance of a definite upward trend before the end of 1938.June 1938.
