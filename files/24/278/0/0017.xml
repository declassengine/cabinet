SIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)-.P.  182(58).E C R E ToCOPY NOCAB I N E T0DEFENCE OF MERCHANT SHIPPING.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I desire to draw the attention of my colleagues to an important question of policy which arises in connection with the arming of merchant ships at the outbreak of war, namely, the effect that such arming, and the use of the armament when fitted, might have on the tactics pursued by the enemy in attacking our trade.2. At the outset, I should like to emphasise that,in the opinion both of myself and my advisers, the right of merchant ships under international law   to carry and to use a defensive armament is established beyond all doubt 5 and furthermore, that if the effect of the carriage    and use of such an armament is to render it dangerous or even impossible for enemy submarines or aircraft to operate against our shipping without violating the fundamental humanitarian rules of sea warfare, then the enemy are under a legal obligation to abstain from such operations. In other words,  the fact that a legitimate operation of war is dangerous or impossible cannot be regarded as legal justification for the resort to illegal methods of attaining the same or a similar end.3. During the war of 1914-1918, the arming ofthe bulk of our merchant  ships (as distinct from a limited number of liners armed at the beginning of the
war as a protection against possible surface raiders) was subsequent to the adoption of illegal methods of attack by the enemy.      This delay wass howevers due entirely to the shortage of suitable guns.       Experience demonstrated in the most unmistakable way the value Of a defensive armament as. a means of protection against submarines.      The practical effect is to make an attack by gunfire both dangerous to  the submarine and likely to be unproductive of effective results, and thus to oblige the enemy, if he intends to go on attacking our trade9 to do so by means of torpedoes fired by the submarine submerged,.      Thus the number of targets which can be attacked is cut down to a minimum, since the number of torpedoes which can be carried by a submarine is limited.      Although war experience is . lacking,,  it seems probable that the possession of a gun armament would be equally effective as a protection against aircraft attack, since the aircraft would be deterred from coming to effective bomb or machine gun range.40 Until recently,  the policy of the Admiraltyhas been to defer taking a decision on the question of arming our merchant ships until such time as the tactics likely to be pursued by the enemy had become apparent. Investigations have shown, however, that  the process of arming would take at least six, or more probably twelve months to complete, whereas the enemy could obviously adopt the tactics of unrestricted attack by the mere issue of an order.      It has  also become apparent that attack on our shipping, by surface
raiders and aircraft as well as by submarines, might, unless effective counter steps are taken, be decisive against us, as the submarine campaign so nearly was in the last war.      In this connection the already depleted volume of tonnage available for essential imports such as foodstuffs must constitute an additional source of anxiety.5. It might seem from the foregoing that,in spite of the obvious practical and other objections, our merchant shipping ought to carry its defensive armament in peace.      It is not however certain that the enemy would resort to completely unrestricted warfare at the very commencement of the war.      In the last war, full unrestricted warfare at sea did not &quot;begin until 1917.6. I am therefore inclined to think thatthe risk of not arming in peace can be accepted,but I am convinced it is essential that arming shouldbe put in hand immediately upon the outbreak ofwar.7. This being accepted, the point to which I desire to draw the attention of my colleagues is that
the arming of our merchant ships might provide the enemy not only with a reason, hut also with an excuse, for resorting to unrestricted attack;    even though, as I have stated above,  it would not in fact he any justification from the strictly legal point of view. The passage of the Submarine Protocol dealing with the matter states that a merchant ship may not he sunk unless the passengers and crew are first placed in safety&quot;except in the case of persistent refusal to stop .....orof active resistance to visit and search ... . * 11     The enemy might,  therefore, argue that the large majority of, if not all, British ships were armed and ready to use their armament, and that on the basis of the above quoted wording they were therefore entitled to sink all British ships at sight, without making provision for the safety of passengers and crew.      Although the correct interpretation of the words quoted is that each ship must be treated on its merits, and must not be sunk unless in each individual case there is &quot;persistent refusal&quot; or &quot;active resistance&quot;,  there is obviously room for misrepresentation.8. A further relevant consideration arises from theuse of disguise, a recognised and legitimate ruse of war, which in the opinion of the Naval Staff it is essential we should employ in connection with the defence of shipping.      If therefore the enemy were to sink neutral ships in mistake for British, it would be open to him to assert that the mistake was due to our adoption of disguise and not to their own failure to identify the ship first (e. g. by boarding), which we had made impossible by our policy of arming.
9. A possible means of mitigating these difficulties might be to proceed with the arming of ships as from the commencement of war, but to issue instructions to the masters of merchant ships (which could if necessary be made public) that the armament when fitted was not to be used against enemy submarines unless the enemy embarked on unrestricted warfare.      It would thus be impossible for the enemy to argue that we had driven them to such tactics by refusing them the opportunity of making captures in a legal manner.      On reflection, however,  I am clear that such a policy is not one I could recommend to the Cabinet.      Sooner or later,  it would inevitably happen that valuable tonnage and perhaps valuable lives, would be lost as a result of a Government instruction to a British ship-master not to resist in the face of the enemy.      The political storm which might be roused by such an occurrence requires little imagination to foresee.10.        I therefore invite my colleagues to approve the following proposals -(a) that the recognised policy should be to commence the defensive arming of merchant ships immediately upon the outbreak of war.(b) That the instructions to masters of ships withan armament should be to the effect that they should use their guns to resist any attack or attempt at capture by an enemy warship, submarine or aircraft, whether made in accordance with the rules of war or not, as long as there appears to be a reasonable chance of escape.(Intld. )     D* C.Admiralty, S.W. 1.21st July, 1938.
