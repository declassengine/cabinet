THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 19381SECRET. Copy No.  43CP. 197 (38).CABINET.CENTRAL EUROPE.Czechoslovakia. &apos;Memorandum by the&quot;Secnetary of State for Foreign Affairs.AT yesterday&apos;s meeting of the Cabinet I referred to a letter which I had received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris regarding the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the event of a German attack upon Czechoslovakia. I circulate the text of this letter herewith, together with the text of the reply which I have sent to Sir Eric Phipps.H.September 13, 1938.Sir E. Phipps to Viscount Halifax. (Private and Confidential.)My dear Secretary of State, Paris, September 10, 1938.BONNET said to me in the course of our conversation this morning that he wished to put a question to me, not to the Ambassador but to the friend.Supposing the Germans attacked Czechoslovakia and France mobilised, as she at once would. Supposing France then turned to Great Britain and said &quot; We are going to march; will you march with us ? &quot;What would our answer be ? Bonnet said it was tremendously important to know, and if the question were put it would be tremendously important that the answer should be immediate and quite plain, one way or the other.I replied, speaking personally, that not only could I not give an answer to this hypothetical question, but that I really did not believe that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment could either.So much, I said, depended upon the nature of the German &quot; aggression,&quot; for instance. Supposing, for the sake of argument, that the Czech police or crowd lost their heads and killed several Sudeten Germans, and that Hitler, in response to an appeal for help, marched in. Would that constitute an act of aggression that would warrant an affirmative reply by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the above-mentioned question by France? One of many other shadings of &quot; aggression &quot; might take place, and I could not conceive of a cut-and-dried reply that would apply to all of them.Bonnet begged me to treat all this as very private; in fact, he indicated that he did not wish his question to me to be officially recorded. Hence this private letter, which I told him I would write. /In the course of our conversation I indicated that the positions of our two countries were not quite similar. France was bound by a definite pact, whereas we were not. To this Bonnet objected that the moment had passed for legal subtleties. It was vital for our two countries to act together in the matter, which might be one of life or death.10041   [17874]d i3
Bonnet repeated what he has said to me so often, viz. : that the French Government will adopt any plan of settlement suggested by Lord Runciman or by His Majesty&apos;s Government.My impression is that Bonnet, perhaps more than Daladier, and certainly much more than Mandel, Reynaud and Co., is desperately anxious for a possible way out of this impasse without being obliged to fight.I of course always indicate that, although Lord Runciman may produce a plan as a last card, it would be greatly preferable that that last card should not have to be played. The ideal solution remains one agreed upon by the Sudeten and the Czechoslovaks.Yours, &amp;c.ERIC PHIPPS.Viscount Halifax to Sir E. Phipps.My dear Phipps, Foreign Office, September 12, 1938.I GOT your private and confidential letter of the 10th September last night, in which you transmitted to me the question that Bonnet had put to you, not as Ambassador but as a friend. I naturally recognise of what importance it would be to the French Government to have a plain answer to such a question. But, as you pointed out to Bonnet and I think, if I may say so, that your language was admirable-the question itself, though plain in form, cannot be dissociated from the circumstances in which it might be posed, which are necessarily at this stage completely hypothetical.Moreover, in this matter it is impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to have regard only to their own position, inasmuch as in any decision they may reach or action they may take they would, in fact, be committing the Dominions. Their Governments would quite certainly be unwilling to have their position in any way decided for them in advance of the actual circumstances, of which they would desire themselves to judge.So far, therefore, as I am in a position to give any answer at this stage to M. Bonnefs question, it would have to be that, while His Majesty&apos;s Government would never allow the security of France to be threatened, they are unable to make precise statements of the character of their future action, or the time at which it would be taken, in circumstances that they cannot at present foresee.    &apos;Yours, &amp;c.HALIFAX.
