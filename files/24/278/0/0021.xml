IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY.....OF this., BMTANN-IC. MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.EGRET..P.   186(56).COPY NO.CAB I N E T.I9 &quot;united KINGDOM-INDIA TRADE NEGOTIATIONS.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; MMemorandum By the President of the Board of Trade..I 1In CP.40(38)    I gave my colleagues a report of the course of negotiations for a new Trade Agreement with India up to 18th February last, and of the concessions which the Government of India were demanding as the price of an Agreement which would, on the other side of the picture, contain satisfactory concessions to our trade in cotton piece goods to India together with undertakings with regard to the consumption here of Indian raw cotton.      I then said that the price demanded seemed to me too high and I did not recommend it, on commercial grounds, for acceptance.     My colleagues decided that, subject to a satisfactory settlement of the cotton issue, they were prepared to accept an Agreement on the lines suggested by the Government of India (Cabinet 10(38), Conclusion 8).As a result of this decision, a mission representing the cotton trade went to India and spent two or three weeks in negotiation with the representatives of the Indian industry and of the producers of raw cotton.      They failed to find a basis for an agreement.    The concessions on cotton piece goods which the Indian advisers were prepared to contemplate fell far short of the lowest which the Lancashire mission felt it possible to consider, while the demands as to the amount of raw cotton which they.should agree to purchase were far greater than they could contemplate accepting.The industries having failed to agree, it remained for the Governments to attempt to reach agreement themselves.-1-
Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan has been here for some weeks now in discussion with my Department.      He is prepared to offer a reduction of the present 20f&amp; duty on cotton piece goods to 15% (on prints from 25% to 17-gf6)  the duty to be reduced to 1.2^% if our exports drop below 350 million yards, to be increased again to 15*.* if they reach 4-25 million yards, and to be increased above 15^5 if they exceed 500 million yards (the duty on prints to be 2-g^ above that on other goods throughout). So far as raw cotton is concerned, we should agree to take 500,000 bales in the first year, 550,000 in the second and 600,000 a year thereafter, a failure to reach the stipulated figure being compensated by reducing the figures at which we are entitled to lower duties.    - Virtue in the form of taking 750,000 bales of raw cotton would be rewarded by bringing the duty on prints down to the level of that on other goods.These terms are less favourable than Lancashire had hoped for;    on the other hand,  they are better than the Government of India were prepared to offer even a week ago.      I am assured by the leader of the Indian delegation that they are the best terms the Government of India can offer and that the alternative is not a continuance of the present modus Vivendi but a break.Lancashire representatives were consulted a fortnight ago on the Indian offer as it then stood.      The terms in which they rejected it make it most improbable that they will approve (and promise to support) an agreement on the new lines. Their attitude now seems to be that the Government must take the decision, leaving them free to approve or to criticise as they may subsequently decide.      I myself feel a pledge of Lancashire&apos;s approval and support to be essential.A decision is a matter of urgency.    Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan leaves for India by air on Friday, the 29th July.O.F.G. S.Board of Trade.27th July,  1938.
