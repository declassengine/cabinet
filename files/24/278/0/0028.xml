THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1938.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 193 (38).CABINET.TALKS IN JERUSALEM.Memorandum by Secretary of State for the Colonies.WHEN I was in Jerusalem on the 6th and 7th August I had discussions, sometimes individually and sometimes Avith two or more of them together, with the High Commissioner, General Haining, Major Saunders (the Inspector-General of Police), and a number of the leading British officials in the Administration. The following is a summary of the main points which emerged from these talks  1. Possible Meeting with Jewish and Arab Representatives in Jerusalem.When I arrived I told the Lligh Commissioner that I had come principally for talks with him and General Haining. But I could not help feeling that the effect of the visit might be all the better if I could meet, even if only as a matter of courtesy and to inform them of the purpose of my coming, some of the leading-Jews and Arabs before I left. Indeed, I thought there might be criticism of my visit by both communities if I confined my contacts to those with members of the Government, and appeared to be indifferent to the presence of Jews and Arabs. On the other hand, a meeting with them might have an excellent psychological effect. I recognised that it was important that my presence in Jerusalem should not be generally known until I had got away, but I thought that it should be possible for leaders of the two communities to be summoned to Government House for talks with his Excellency, and for me to be introduced to them then, and to leave for the aerodrome immediately after the talks, perhaps before our visitors themselves had left Government House. The communique announcing my visit would be published immediately afterwards.The High Commissioner said that he would be extremely glad if this were jaossible, but he was afraid it would not be. He could easily get Jewish repre-sentatives up to Government House, but he would be at a loss to know which Arabs to invite. No Arab political leaders could safely come and discuss politics with him or me. It would put them in an exceedingly embarrassing position, and even in danger of foul play from terrorists afterwards. Even if they only came for a few minutes and a hand-shake they would be suspect. Moreover, there was in fact no political Arab organisation the members of which could be conveniently selected for such a meeting with me. The Higher Arab Committee had been broken up. He was now nursing the Supreme Moslem Council, but was deliberately avoiding making this a political body, at any rate for the present. It was concerned with the administration of religious affairs, though he hoped that eventually its members might become the avowed leaders of Arab political opinion against the extremists. But this would be a slow process, and he could not put any undue strain upon its members now.[17804] b
I said that if it was impossible for me to meet Arabs, then I would not propose to meet Jews. I quite understood the difficulties which he had mentioned, and would therefore abandon any idea of making a personal contact with Jewish and Arab leaders during the visit.2. Form, of Government in the present Emergency.In my first talk with the High Commissioner and General Haining together I started by expressing my pleasure that they had agreed to my coming to Palestine. So that they might understand the considerations which had prompted me to make the suggestion, I would trace for them the evolution of my own mind during the last few weeks on the question of government in Palestine. On returning to the Colonial Office I naturally regarded the Palestine question as the most urgent and important with which I had to deal in the immediate future. I was as unhappy as they doubtless were at the continuance of terrorism in the country 3 and had wondered whether the present form of government was suitable to the crisis, and had considered with an open mind whether some more drastic form of government, including even the declaration of martial law and establish-ment of complete military control, was necessary. Before making up my mind, I had consulted not only the experienced advisers in my own department, but also representatives of the War Office and Air Ministry, and Sir Charles Tegart, who had recently returned from active participation in the government of Palestine. As a result I had definitely reached the conclusion that the present regime was the right one. It seemed to me that it combined two great advantages. First, one of the principal long-term objectives in Palestine was to establish completely the authority of the Civil Administration; it was highly desirable therefore to avoid, if possible, any step which would destroy the prestige of that Administration. On the contrary, we wanted to build up its prestige. It would have to stay in the country and govern it beyond the present troubles, when we had been able to withdraw abnormal military forces. It must have the respect of Palestinians. If we now abolished the Civil Administration, and left the military to tidy up the mess, and then restored the Civil Administration to power after peace had been re-established, that Administration would command no respect and only a minimum of authority; its task in governing the country afterwards would be rendered much more difficult. Short of a complete breakdown in government which would make absolutely unfettered military control necessary I therefore thought that the Civil Administration should be maintained throughout the troubles, so that it shared the responsibility and prestige of restoring order. But powerful though this argument was, I would not be entirely persuaded by it if the present regime did not secure a second important advantage, i.e., that although the Civil Administration was kept in being and was functioning as the ultimate authority in the country, the military who were co-operating with it had all the powers which they required in present circumstances to do their work effectively. Powers had already been delegated to them under the existing Order-in-Council; in particular, the Military Courts were operating throughout the country. I also understood that sympathetic co-operation had been so successfully established between the High Commissioner and General Haining and between their respective subordinates that the military did not feel that their operations against the terrorists were being in the least hampered through their not having absolute control. The plan of campaign now being pursued, i.e., the occupation of the northern villages, the building of roads, &amp;c, was in fact a plan worked out very largely by the military.Therefore the present, regime .seemed to me to achieve two most important purposes, one or other of which might be destroyed by any change. I had expressed these views at-a recent.Cabinet meeting, and believed that they were shared by my colleagues. - Therefore, the High Commissioner and General Haining would understand that I had not come to see them with any idea of criticising the present regime in Palestine, or of discussing major proposals for its alteration. On the contrary, one of my purposes was to assure them personally of our whole-hearted support. It was possible that in the course of our discussions I would put forward suggestions on matters of detail, but unless either the High Commissioner or General Haining wanted to raise the question in principle, I would not propose to discuss it.
The High Commissioner and General Haining both expressed their gratifi-cation at what I had said. They welcomed the chance of talks with someone from home. They were both in agreement with the arguments which I had mentioned in support of the present regime in present circumstances.General Haining, no less than the High Commissioner, is averse to any greater military control, unless a much worse emergency arises. He said that in his opinion they will have the situation well in hand by about the middle of September if nothing occurs to give the Arab extremists an excuse to stir up a fresh spasm of trouble. The civil-cum-military plans against the terrorists are proceeding generally satisfactorily, and the machinery of co-operation has been improved so that delay in getting action taken is now the exception instead of the rule. There have been areas where personnel or the machine have been bad; Haifa was a case in point. But things were better there now as a result of the establishment of a security committee on which the chief political, military and police officers work together. But if the Arab extremists did take an opportunity to put fresh life into terrorism, and the situation suddenly deteriorated greatly either in Palestine as a whole or in any given area, then the General thinks that we should act swiftly and that full military control would then be necessary, either over the whole country or in the area concerned. He is apprehensive (and the High Commissioner fully shares this apprehension) that the Arabs may endeavour to create new trouble on a large scale when the Woodhead Commission have completed their Report, or are about to complete their Report, or when Parliament is about to decide policy.3. The Present Position regarding Seciirity.The High Commissioner and General Haining gave me the following picture of the security position at the present time, dividing the problem into three parts covering three different areas in the country :  (a) The toivns, such as Jerusalem and Haifa.The principal problem in the towns is bomb-throwing. There is no evidence of the importation of these bombs from outside Palestine. Such evidence as has been picked up from the scenes of outrages all shows that the bombs are locally manufactured, though in some cases the manufacture is extremely skilful. The authorities have found some stores of bombs, and some stores of the contents to be put into bombs, such as rivets. But they have not yet discovered any of the arsenals where manufacture actually takes place, so they have not got to the root of the trouble. (In a later conversation with Major Saunders, he told me that he hoped they would get a clue to the whereabouts of some of the arsenals in the near future; it seemed that the C.I.D. people thought they were on the tracks of something; but I found General Haining rather sceptical as to this.) The position in the towns is therefore still very uncertain, as there are wild men amongst both the Jews and the Arabs, who are not averse to stirring up as much trouble as possible by bomb outrages. Nevertheless, General Haining thought that the position in this respect was at the moment improving. A large number of the Revisionist leaders were under arrest and in concentration camps. The Arab extremists also had been rounded up in large numbers. Here and there bombs had been discovered lying about more or less harmlessly lately, and the General thought that a good many of those who had been involved were getting rather tired of this activity and were anxious to get rid of their bombs.  However, one can only say that the position is extremely uncertain.(b) The troublesome northern areas of Galilee and Samaria.&apos;The building of Tegarts Wall is now finished. General Haining and, I think, the High Commissioner consider that too much has been made of the Wall. Its significance is not so great as has sometimes been made out, and indeed it is such a comparatively insignificant structure (as I saw from a flight over it afterwards) that the General prophesied that in twenty years&apos; time it would be known as &quot;Tegarts Folly.&quot; However, he agrees that it it quite valuable as an additional deterrent to terrorism. Partly owing to [17804] B 2
the existence of the Wall, there is little traffic of men of arms across the Syrian border now. The French seem to be being more helpful than they have been regarding this. The major influences on the Palestine side of the border have been the military reinforcements, the successful occupation of the northern villages by police and military, and the energetic prosecution of a road-building programme in the difficult hill country, which enables the police and military to operate more rapidly and effectively. The High Com-missioner and General Haining both say that the situation in this trouble-some area has considerably improved iri the last few weeks, and that they now have it fairly well in hand. In their opinion, there are no large terrorist bands left. The trouble arises from the comparatively small number of small bands, which consist for the most part of thorough-going brigands. But they are the permanent nucleus of larger terrorist forces, for they recruit to themselves by night various Arab peasants who are restless and anti-Jew, and who are not averse to joining in violent action for reasonable remunera-tion. In the morning these irregular peasant recruits return to their homes and are apparently ordinary peaceful citizens. The problem is to destroy the nucleus bands. A number of actions lately have resulted in considerable casualties, both by death and by wounding, amongst the brigands.The terrorists themselves are making great efforts by propaganda to represent that they are a much greater force numerically than the authorities believe them in fact to be. Various pro-Arabs in Jerusalem and elsewhere speak of many thousands of Arabs belonging to the terrorist organisations, and of their being mobilised and armed on a grand scale in Galilee and Samaria. The High Commissioner and General Haining both regard these tales as great exaggerations.(c) The southern area, i.e., the country which lies south of &quot; the, Peel line.&quot;This area has been comparatively quiet of late. But the High Com-missioner and General Haining are doubtful Avhether this happy state of affairs will continue. The Arabs of the south are being reproached by some of their political leaders for remaining law-abiding. They are being told that they have let down the Arab cause. Moreover, the activities of the Woodhead Commission are being exploited with a view to stirring up trouble in the south. It is widely known in Palestine that the Commission are at least considering the modification of the Peel partition plan by the omission of Galilee from the Jewish State, and Arab agitators are claiming to Arab people that the reason for this is that the Arabs in Galilee have caused so much trouble that the authorities recognise that there would never be peace if this considerable Arab population were included in a Jewish State. These same agitators go on to tell the southern Arabs that unless they make violent protests some of their country Avill be giAren to the Jewish State as compensa-tion for the loss of Galilee. It is known that the Woodhead Commission have at least considered this possibility. Therefore, the southern Arabs are being urged to support a fresh campaign of terrorism in self-defence. So far things have not gone further than the making of inflammatory speeches. But the High Commissioner and General Haining anticipate that there may be more serious trouble in this area in the near future.I said to the High Commissioner and the General that this picture seemed to indicate that the terrorist movement as such amongst the Arabs Avas not a spontaneous national movement of the Palestinian Arabs as a whole, but the result of strenuous agitation by political leaders and the activity, no doubt often accompanied by intimidation, of bands of banditti who had no genuine political significance, but were delighted at the chance to fish in troubled waters. Was I correct in drawing this deduction, or did they think that the movement was really a sort of national movement ? v They replied that they thought that terrorism was not a national movement, ^he moderate Arab leaders were opposed to it, and the great majority of Arabs in the country disliked it and began to feel that it was fruitless. But the power of intimidation of the terrorists Avas so great and Arab politicians generally were so lackingjn courage that there was no lead against the terrorists amongst Arabs. If the Mufti were not sitting just across the border, other political leaders might arise; but whilst he is there the Arabs could not believe that he would not soon return to Palestine; indeed, many of them presumed
that we wanted him there, otherwise we would surely be able to make the French remove him to some place where he would be harmless. However, the Palestinian Arabs generally were strongly hostile to the Jews, and though this feeling might not lead most of them to join in a national movement of violence, it was a national sentiment throughout Arab Palestine and beyond.Both the High Commissioner and General Haining say that Arab feeling and Jewish feeling have hardened very greatly during recent months. Tension and fear have resulted in an uncompromising attitude being taken up by both sides. There is scarcely any capacity for compromise left in the great majority of either of them, so far as Jews and Arabs in Palestine itself are concerned. Therefore we are not likely to get much help from, either of these two elements in any efforts at conciliation and peacemaking.4. The Security Forces at the Governments Disposal.So far as the military forces in Palestine are concerned, General Haining is satisfied that these are sufficient, at any rate for the present situation. Recent news certainly seems to indicate that they are doing very effective work, in co-operation with the police. A very large number of bandits have been killed during the last three or four weeks. The new Middle Eastern Brigade is due to arrive in Palestine before the end of September. If the situation has not altered, the three battalions which recently arrived as reinforcements from Egypt will then be withdrawn from Palestine, so that the net result will be that the -military forces at the disposal of the Government in Palestine will remain at their present level. But if the position shoWs signs of deteriorating, and it seems necessary for additional forces to be there, and the situation elsewhere does not require them, I understand that the War Office will be willing that the recent reinforcements should not be withdrawn.The High Commissioner and General Haining both agreed that the great weakness of the present organisation lies in the police. They attribute this largely to the inefficient organisation of the police force under the former Inspector-General, who retired recently. I was told that the force looked very pretty in his day, always turning out with spotless uniforms and shining buttons on parade. But for various reasons they were extraordinarily bad at doing their work, especially when serious trouble was about. Both their Intelligence and their action in the field were ineffective. The new Inspector-General, Major Saunders, is doing well. Perhaps he is not absolutely first-class, but he has tireless energy, co-operates well with the military, and has the complete confidence of his own men. The Intelligence Service, also under a new head, is much improved, though information from Arab sources is more scarce than it was. But there are three main weaknesses : first, the headquarters staff is ridiculously inadequate; second, there are not a sufficient number of good police officers in charge of units operating in difficult *areas; third, there are not sufficient British rank-and-file.These faults are all being corrected now. Until recently Major Saunders has had practically no assistance of any kind at police headquarters in Jerusalem. He himself has done everything there, acting as head of every department, writing his own reports in his own hand, and at the same time dashing all over the country to get in touch with his subordinate officers and men where there was trouble. Of late he has been provided with a general assistant at headquarters, who has already relieved him of much detailed work. But he needs a far bigger headquarters staff, and we are now seeking in London four additional officers of experience and ability for full-time posts at head-quarters. One will be in sole charge of all transport problems, another will be the head of the department dealing with the various forms of auxiliary police in the country, and so on. The appointment of these officers should leave Major Saunders himself free to concentrate on those major matters which alone ought to trouble the Inspector-General in critical times like the present. The position at headquarters is going to be closely watched, and the possibility of appointing yet another additional officer there is being considered.As regards the appointment of additional officers in the field, one is being sent from London and the others are being promoted from the ranks in Palestine.We are considerably increasing the numbers of British police in Palestine. My colleagues will remember that I informed them some weeks ago that the [178041 b 3
Crown Agents for the Colonies had been instructed to recruit 236 extra police for Palestine. My enquiries in Jerusalem convinced me that, even with this addition, the Force had not a sufficient reserve against emergencies, and scarcely even an adequate reserve for present purposes. The High Commissioner and Major Saunders agreed with this, and we are now recruiting another 135 British Police in addition to the 236 already announced.Another weakness of the police force which has persisted until quite recently is also being corrected. Many of the men recruited were of the wrong type; they came more or less straight from public schools in this country, and some of them were not really fitted for the strenuous warfare which the Palestine police all too often have to engage in.   We are now recruiting only ex-Servicemen.One reason why these additions to the British personnel are necessary is that the Arab members of the Police Force are liable to become more and more unreliable. The Arab supernumerary police are already unreliable and are used to a minimum. The authorities feel that they cannot dismiss them altogether, for to do so would be to make a present of the whole Arab supernumerary police force to the terrorists. In fairness to these Arab policemen it should be said that they are in a very embarrassing position. They are servants of the British Administration, and as such owe loyalty to it. On the other hand, they cannot discount the possibility that in the near future under a partition scheme Arab and Jewish States will be established in Palestine, in which case they anticipate that their services will be transferred to the Arab State. If they have shown too great zeal in suppressing Arab terrorism in the meanwhile, they are not likely to receive very good treatment from their Arab masters later on. So their difficult policy at the moment is one of trying to keep a foot in each camp.The Jewish Police, both regulars and supernumeraries, are, on the other hand, reliable. They have their faults, such as that in a fight they are too apt to shoot off their ammunition in a great hurry. There are a number of other details regarding the organisation of the police which I discussed in Jerusalem (such as the effective organisation of a mounted police force) with which I need not trouble my colleagues.It would be of considerable assistance if Sir Charles Tegart could return to Palestine, and I discussed this with the High Commissioner and the General. We agreed that he should return at the beginning of October for a month or so, to review the carrying out of the various proposals which he made when he was acting in an advisory capacity in Palestine recently. But I asked the High Commissioner and General Haining also to consider whether there is any means by which we might keep him longer in Palestine, not in an advisory but in an executive post. There is no question of displacing Major Saunders, who has only lately gone to Palestine and has made a good start. But in these very difficult times Sir Charles Tegarts qualities would be invaluable, if harnessed to the machine; and the High Commissioner and General Haining are eager for his help. After considering one or two. alternatives, the idea which found most favour when I left Jerusalem was that Sir Charles might be offered a post in Trans-Jordan. Trans-Jordan may well be a difficult area at a later stage of all this business, and in any case if he were situated there, he would be easily available for work in Palestine in an emergency. This matter is being considered further in Jerusalem. I do not know whether Sir Charles Tegart would agree to a suggestion of the above nature.As regards the staffing of the Administration itself in Palestine, there was at one time a shortage of good Secretariat officers in Jerusalem and good district officers outside. But some months ago additional officers were sent, transferred from different parts of the Colonial Empire, and now again we are sending reinforcements of about half a dozen carefully picked men to Palestine.5, Machinery of Co-operation between the Civil and Military Authorities.I found that the machinery for co-operation and co-ordination between the Civil Administration and the- Military is working satisfactorily. There is a Central Security Committee in Jerusalem under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary, on which sit high political, police and military officers. It meets every day and settles all sorts of questions of policy and co-ordination which previously led to friction and waste of time.   This organisation is reproduced in every area
headquarters throughout Palestine, the local political head, police chief and commanding officer meeting together regularly in Committee and maintaining contact with the Central Security Committee. I discussed with the High Com-missioner and General Haining various points arising out of this organisation. For instance, I suggested that the High Commissioner and the General might themselves attend meetings of the Ceutral Security Committee as occasion required, so that matters of major importance could be settled at once in their presence without time being taken for1 reference to them after the meeting. But both of them, as well as their subordinates, are satisfied that the present machinery is better. The High Commissioner and the General&quot; meet&apos;regularly two or three evenings a week for discussions together at Government House, and feel that this is the best arrangement. .&apos; . . &apos;Another matter which we discussed was the question whether, in order to improve efficiency and speed of action, the police should come directly under the orders of the military. But again the High Commissioner and the General were of the opinion that the present arrangement is satisfactory in present circumstances. Co-ordination of effort through the Security Committees has worked sufficiently well to reduce difficulties to a minimum. If the situation were to deteriorate, and more drastic action become necessary, then placing the police under the military might be the first step to be adopted towards full military control.6. Procedure for Settling Policy.We discussed the procedure which we should pursue in connection with the examination of the Woodhead Commission^ Report and the formulation of a long-term policy which would receive a reasonable amount of support at home, in Palestine and elsewhere.I said that I attached great importance to the Government deciding upon and announcing its policy at a fairly early date after the publication of the Woodhead Report. Thereafter that policy should be put into &apos; effect without delay. But I was anxious that before we announced our final conclusions we should make some attempt at negotiation with the Jews and the Arabs. If we were to rally not only our own public opinion but also important foreign opinion generally to our support, we must establish the fact that we had done everything possible to hear Jewish and Arab views, and to discuss policy with them. It would help, for instance, with Governments whose sympathy lay with the Arabs, if we had had some sort of conference with Arab leaders, however abortive. Therefore, the proposal which I at present had it in mind to make (though I was not necessarily bound by it ultimately) was that we should work in three stages : -Stage 1 would last from the moment when we ourselves knew what the Woodhead Commission^ recommendations were going to be until the time when these recommendations were published to the world. This period might last for six or seven weeks, since we might know the outline of the recom-mendations a fortnight or so before they were formally presented in a Report, and after presentation it would take some weeks to translate and. print the Report for publication in three languages. During this period the Govern-ment in the United Kingdom and Administration in Palestine should be taking counsel together, and possibly with others, and reaching their tentative but fairly definite conclusions on what the right policy was.Stage 2. I would propose that on the publication of the Report we should not make any public announcement of our own tentative conclusions upon it. We should announce, at whatever was the appropriate moment, that we were anxious to allow a short time to elapse for people generally to study the Report so that we might have the advantage of the comments of various interested peoples before we reached our own final conclusions. In particular we were anxious to discuss with the Jewish Agency and with Arab leaders, and we proposed to invite both parties to send representatives to London for these discussions. But the discussions should not be . protracted, for uncertainty had already lasted&apos; long enough, and it was of the highest importance that policy should be decided within at the most three
or four weeks, and if possible sooner. The second stage would last, therefore, from the publication of the Woodhead Report to the completion of our attempts at getting Jewish and Arab agreement to a settlement, and would at the most take only a few weeks. During this period we might also be sounding informally King Ibn Saud and other important&apos; authorities outside Palestine. If it were possible to start these contacts with Jews and Arabs before the end of Stage 1, that would be all the better, but it might be difficult to do this before the Woodhead Report had been made public.Stage 3 would commence with the announcement of the Governments policy. As rapidly as possible after that we should get Parliamentary assent to it, and then the assent of the League of Nations, so that the policy could be implemented without further delay&apos;.I said that of course the most difficult part of this programme was the proposal to get Jewish and Arab representatives into conference in London. There would be no difficulty about getting the Jews to come, but what were the chances of getting the Arabs ?   Presumably they would not come if the basis for discussion were to be partition.   Assuming for the moment that our own conclusion still was that some form of partition was the best policy, it might nevertheless be possible to find a formula for the conference which did not bind the Arabs themselves to partition, and which would enable them therefore to attend and make their case.   But even if this first difficulty could be overcome, a second and perhaps more formidable one presented itself.  Who would represent the Arabs ?   They should not, in my view, be represented by Arab leaders from outside Palestine.   We should do nothing to encourage the idea that the rulers of neighbouring Arab States had any formal part in the affairs of Palestine. I was in favour of making appropriate informal soundings of King Ibn Saud and others on the question of policy (probably by the device of keeping them &quot;informed&quot; of our intentions) and of doing everything we could to get their acquiescence in, if not their approval of, our policy.   But they could not be brought formally into the negotiations.  The Arab representatives at a conference must be representatives of the Palestinian Arabs.   But the Palestinian Arabs might well be terrorised into saying that, if their representatives could not be the Mufti and his friends, then they would send nobody.   It had been suggested to me by the Egyptian Prime Minister and others that we should recall these Arab leaders from their exile in order to negotiate with them.   I myself was strongly opposed to this suggestion.  It seemed to me that to pursue such a course would be to abdicate a great deal of our authority in Palestine to men who were responsible for terrorism itself.   If we decided not to recall these Arab representatives, then what chance was there, in the High Commissioners view, of other representatives being found to come to speak for the Palestinian Arabs % The High Commissioner replied that he was in favour of an attempt at negotiations, though he also urged the desirability of any such discussions being comparatively short, since the importance of an early decision on policy could not be exaggerated.   But he felt that it was impossible for us to make up our minds definitely in favour of such discussions until we knew what the Woodhead Commission^ recommendations would be.   If the recommendations were for a scheme of partition on the Peel lines, and if it were obvious that His Majesty&apos;s Governments proposals would contain such a scheme of partition, it would be practically impossible to get any Arabs to come into conference.   In that case it might be a mistake to invite them, only to receive a snub.   As regards the Mufti and his close associates, he was of opinion that we should not give countenance to any suggestion to discuss with them.   Indeed, he said that, if the British Government decided to negotiate with the Mufti, we should have to find another High Commissioner.   He thought that the Mufti himself should never be allowed to return to Palestine.   He did not rule out the possibility of his colleagues who were now in the Seychelles returning ultimately, but in his view this should not be until a settlement had been reached in Palestine, that settlement had been put fully into effect, and peace had been restored.    He admitted that it might be impossible to get other Arab representatives to enter into discussions with us; this would certainly be impossible if the fact of their entering into discussions meant that the Arabs were committed to partition.  But he thought a formula could be found which avoided this, and circumstances might so turn out that some moderate and influential Arabs would come to London.
7. Policy.I had a talk with the High Commissioner, Mr. Moody (the Acting Chief Secretary), Mr. Johnson (the Treasurer), and Mr. Harris (who was attached to the Woodhead Commission as a special Officer from the Administration) on the question of policy. This was necessarily a very tentative discussion, because we are all to a certain extent in the dark until we know what the Woodhead Commission are going to recommend. The High Commissioner and these officers of the Administration had some idea of how the Commissioners&apos; minds were shaping, but they had no definite information, and the Commissioners themselves will not begin to reach final conclusions until they have heard more evidence in London. But the High Commissioner had gained two definite impressions about the Commission as a result of conversations with them : first, that there was a division of opinion amongst its members which might lead to a Majority and a Minority Report being presented; and secondly, that the partition scheme which the Commissioners were working upon would offer the Jews a considerably smaller Jewish State than was contemplated by the authors of the Peel Report. It would seem that Sir John Woodhead and his colleagues have been impressed by the great difficulty of incorpoi&apos;ating Galilee, with its almost exclusively Arab population, in the Jewish State, and that they are likely to exclude this from the proposals which they make for a Jewish area. They have considered a number of schemes by which the Jewish State might be compensated elsewhere, but Mr. Harris seemed to be of opinion that they would conclude finally that such compensation could not be found. But, as I say, neither the High Commissioner nor Mr. Harris, nor any of the others had any definite idea as to the Commissioners&apos; thoughts. Sir John Woodhead and his colleagues have been extremely cautious about expressing any opinions to anybody, and members of the Administration generally have only drawn their conclusions from the general tenour of the Commissioners&apos; remarks in conversation. Also, as I say, the Commissioners themselves may be influenced by further evidence which they hear in London. So it would be premature to comment on the question of what the Commissioners are likely to report.But if the High Commissioner^ surmise proves correct, the question of policy becomes more complicated. Nor is it rendered any easier by what I discovered in Jerusalem,. i.e., that there is really very little unity of thought at present amongst high officials in the Administration as to what our policy should be. I find that the four men whom I have mentioned above produced in conver-sation three different solutions to the immediate problem. These three solutions are not necessarily irreconcilable, but they have still sufficient differences to illustrate the divergence of views which this extremely difficult problem produces amongst those who have studied it most closely. In a way, those who have lived in Palestine for a long time have studied it too closely; sometimes they cannot see the wood for the trees.The High Commissioner himself is flirting with the idea of offering the Jews immediately a very small Jewish State in the plain of Sharon. Outside this Palestine would continue to be governed under a modified Mandate, under which Jewish immigration would only be allowed in order to complete the full develop-ment of existing Jewish settlements. The establishment of new Jewish settlements would be prohibited. After about five years an Arab State would be established in the whole of Palestine excluding the Jewish State and certain areas to be kept under permanent British mandate. Mr. Johnson, on the other hand, declared himself a partitionist in theory, but said that it would be a great mistake to establish either a Jewish or an Arab State in the near future. In his view, we should divide the country into two areas (apart from what must always be kept under British Mandate), which might be described as Jewish and Arab reserves. These reserves would ultimately become Jewish and Arab States, but only after a period of ten years or so, which he believes necessary in order to make various adjustments, especially in the field of finance. Mr. Harris is inclined to feel that partition is going to break down completely and that we shall have to return to the Mandate, with whatever modifications we may feel necessary. His view is that the area which can be offered for a Jewish State will prove so small that it will not be acceptable to the Jews. As a Jewish State cannot be established unless the Jews themselves are ready to create and work it, the partition proposal falls to the ground.   We cannot hand the Jews over as
August 24, 1938.a minority in an Arab State; therefore, the country will have to continue to be governed by Mandate. Mr. Moody had not, I think, any particular pet scheme of his own.I record these views, without troubling my colleagues with the detailed arguments offered in support of them, simply to show how people&apos;s views are at sixes and sevens regarding this problem at the present time. If I were to trouble my colleagues with reports of all the conversations or correspondence which I have had with dozens of other people over the last- two or three months, they would see that there is a great host of conflicting ideas as to what our policy should be. This does not mean that we shall not be able, before the end of the year, to produce a policy which is, in all the circumstances, sound, and which will have a great body of support behind it. I think we can do this, after the most painstaking examination of all proposals and all important opinions.My own contribution to the conversation in Jerusalem did not have the effect of simplifying the discussion. Saying that I was speaking tentatively, I warned the High Commissioner and the others of the strong objections to each one of their plans (it is, of course, easy to find strong objections to every proposal for a solution of the Palestine problem). I said that I personally was still convinced that if something on the lines of the Peel partition scheme could be made practicable, it was the best solution of the problem for the next twenty years or so. After that further evolution might take place in the direction of a coming together again of the broken fragments of Palestine and Syria. I admitted that there were powerful factors in the situation which might well make us decide a month or two hence that something on similar lines to the Peel scheme was, indeed, impracticable. For instance, if the Galilee Arabs were going to create an. impossible situation inside a Jewish State, they would have to be left out. There were other considerations also. I asked the High Commissioner and his colleagues to continue doing a great deal of hard thinking on this problem, so that they would be ready to discuss it with me sometime in October, say, in the light of the Woodhead Commission Report. I said that, on the assumption that the High Commissioner could not come to London, I would propose to return to Jerusalem  or if that were inadvisable, to Cairo or somewhere else handy to consult on policy as soon as possible after I knew what the conclusions of the Commission were going to be.M.
